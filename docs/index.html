<p>Women are still underrepresented in managerial positions, particularly at the top of organisations. It’s not just that women are unable to attain these positions due to discrimination or access to resources. There’s also evidence that suggests these positions may be less attractive to women, as having a senior job tends to increase life satisfaction for men <a href="http://https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11205-009-9560-4"><u>but not for women</u></a>; this could lead to women exiting such career paths or shying away from them even if well qualified. <a href="http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10902-016-9832-z">New research</a> in the <em>Journal of Happiness Studies</em> asks a simple, but important question: why are women managers less happy than their male counterparts?</p>
<p><span id="more-19922"></span></p>
<p>Hilke Brockmann and her colleagues drew on a large German survey conducted between 1984-2011 involving data from 27,000 non-managers and 3174 managers, a third of whom were women. The survey featured questions about life satisfaction, pay and spare time.</p>
<p>Overall, female managers reported slightly lower life satisfaction than their male counterparts, consistent with past research. They also seemed to find higher pay less rewarding than men. Based on correlations between life satisfaction and pay across male and female managers, on the researchers’ estimate it would take an extra €12,000 of pay to boost a woman’s life satisfaction by the same amount that a man would gain from an extra €5,000 of pay.</p>
<p>This is consistent with previous evidence that suggests men value money particularly highly against other benefits like more free time. Also, highly educated ambitious women are likely to settle down with romantic partners who are in similar careers and – especially if their partner is male – who may earn more than them. This means female managers can be in a situation where further gains in their own income matter less, given their net household worth.</p>
<p>Brockmann and her colleagues expected and found that spare time would have a stronger association with happiness for women managers than men. One reason for this is women tend to have less free time than men, as they often take on greater responsibility for caring duties within a household. As managerial promotions often involve sacrificing free time for money, this deal is going to be less attractive for many women.</p>
<p>In fact, Brockmann’s team found that caring less about money and more about time was at the heart of female managers’ dissatisfaction. Their analysis showed that if it were not for those factors, women would be <em>happier</em> in managerial roles than men, which suggests that the nature of managerial work is not a problem for women, but how it is structured and compensated.</p>
<p>The researchers also looked at the issue of whether female managers are more adversely affected than male managers by the decision to delay having children in pursuit of their careers. They found some evidence to support this, in that between the ages of 35 and 45 (when fertility tends to decline in women) childless female managers felt significantly less satisfied with their lives than female managers who’d had children and male managers who were childless.</p>
<p>Brockmann and her colleagues pointed out that the lack of gender parity at senior management levels isn’t solved by simply bringing women into the boardroom, as this may just consign them to an unhappy stay. A major problem is that in most working cultures leadership positions “require a non-stop lifelong commitment to extra-long working hours and early career path-dependencies” which may repel women who particularly value their free time.</p>
<p>One solution for companies who want to attract more female managers would be to build in more breathing space for their leadership positions – after all, successful entrepreneurs can <a href="http://lifehacker.com/im-jason-fried-ceo-of-basecamp-and-this-is-how-i-work-1790556608"><u>build businesses on 40 hours a week</u></a> – and to provide other “temporal rewards” like flexible career paths, especially to help younger women more easily juggle family and work ambitions.</p>

<img alt="Rdd_blog-image" class="attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image" height="150" src="http://blogs.plos.org/plos/files/2017/02/Rdd_blog-image-150x150.png" style="display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;" width="150" /><div class="wp_orcid_field"><a href="http://orcid.org/0000-0001-7318-5892" rel="author" target="_blank">0000-0001-7318-5892</a></div><p>Since <strong><a href="http://www.eurordis.org/news/official-rare-disease-day-2017-video-out-now" target="_blank">2008 in Europe</a></strong> and <strong><a href="https://rarediseases.org/about/" target="_blank">2009 in the US</a></strong>, the last day of February is marked as <strong><a href="http://www.rarediseaseday.org/" target="_blank">Rare Disease Day</a></strong>. In less than 10 years, Rare Disease Day (and #RareDiseaseDay) has grown from a centralized effort to bring attention to these disorders by patient organizations in Europe to an international awareness and action day that includes patients, legislators, research funders, scientists and clinicians.</p>
<p>It is estimated that 350 million people worldwide suffer from rare diseases, defined regionally according to prevalence. In the European Union a rare disease is one that affects less than 1 in 2,000 patients while in the United Kingdom the qualification is less than 50,000 patients and in the United States the classification is less than 200,000 patients. Regardless, rare diseases usually have a genetic basis and are frequently progressive, disabling and with time, life-threatening. There are currently more than <strong><a href="https://globalgenes.org/rare-diseases-facts-statistics/" target="_blank">7,000 different types of rare diseases and disorders</a></strong>, according to the rare disease patient advocacy organization Global Genes.</p>
<p>Those interested in general concepts related to rare disease and treatments or drug development can look to recent PLOS articles covering “<strong><a href="http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0170365" target="_blank">Clinical Practice Guidelines for Rare Diseases: The Orphanet Database</a></strong>,” “<strong><a href="http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0164681" target="_blank">Profitability and Market Value of Orphan Drug Companies: A Retrospective, Propensity-Matched Case-Control Study</a></strong>” and “<strong><a href="http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0140002" target="_blank">Access to Orphan Drugs: A Comprehensive Review of Legislations, Regulations and Policies in 35 Countries</a></strong>.”</p>
<blockquote><p>Research is the <strong><a href="http://www.rarediseaseday.org/page/news/2017-theme-research" target="_blank">theme of Rare Disease Day 2017</a></strong> with the slogan “<strong>With research, possibilities are limitless.”</strong></p></blockquote>
<p>Research published in PLOS journals is a testament to the dedication of scientists working on these diseases that often have less funding and attention than other biomedical issues, and the willingness of these scientists to go beyond publishing Open Access to make their data available for the rare disease community is critical to accelerate a path forward to uncover treatments and cures.</p>

<p>Coincidentally, one of this year’s finalists for the <strong><a href="https://www.openscienceprize.org/" target="_blank">Open Science Prize</a></strong>, given for unique insights developed from shared data, is described in this video “<strong><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWM1bn9e4KU" target="_blank">MyGene2: Accelerating Gene Discovery with Radically Open Data Sharing</a></strong>.” Researchers at the University of Washington created the web portal MyGene2 as a place for people with rare genetic mutations to connect with others that share the condition and with researchers interested in their particular mutation. Michael Bamshad, PLOS author and professor and chief of the Division of Genetic Medicine in the Department of Pediatrics at the University of Washington &amp; Seattle Children’s Hospital, describes this Open Science resource in a RARECast podcast interview, “<strong><a href="https://soundcloud.com/rarecast/helping-patients-with-the-same-undiagnosed-genetic-condition-find-each-other" target="_blank">Helping Patients with the Same Undiagnosed Genetic Condition Find Each Other</a></strong>.” Research from Bamshad’s group also includes <em>PLOS ONE</em> articles on the <strong><a href="http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article/authors?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0065834" target="_blank">implications of fine-scale patterns of population ancestry on rare variant genome-wide association studies</a></strong>, <strong><a href="http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0024745" target="_blank">genetic variation and risk for symptomatic West Nile Virus infection and disease progression</a></strong> and the <em>PLOS Genetics</em> article discussing <a href="http://journals.plos.org/plosgenetics/article?id=10.1371/journal.pgen.1005963" target="_blank"><strong>mutations and a rare-disease inheritance model applied to congenital heart disease</strong>.</a></p>
<p>In addition to data sharing, opportunities to improve diagnoses stem from genetic sequencing advances, as described in <strong><a href="http://journals.plos.org/plosgenetics/article?id=10.1371/journal.pgen.1006081" target="_blank">improving the identification of cancer-associated genes</a></strong> and <strong><a href="http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0146040" target="_blank">co-occurrence of rare diseases and resolution of a complex phenotype by next-gen sequencing</a></strong>.</p>
<p>Rare Disease Day is a chance to draw attention to the research and policies needed to advance understanding of these disorders that challenge the lives of so many. This year’s theme, “with research, possibilities are limitless” meshes well with the community PLOS serves as a science, technology and medicine Open Access publisher.

                <h4><a href="https://blog.scienceexchange.com/2017/02/meet_zev/">Why requesters love Sourcing Manager &amp; neuroscientist, Zev Wisotsky</a></h4>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At Science Exchange, our Masters’ and Ph.D.-level sourcing managers will help you find the right service provider for your project. Based on glowing customer testimonials, we know that our sourcing managers are one of our company’s greatest assets.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Let’s get to know them better! We’ll start with customers’ favorite, Zev Wisotsky. Trained in neuroscience, he devoted his graduate research to studying taste detection in insects.</span></p>
<p><img alt="Zev" class="aligncenter wp-image-1033 size-medium" height="200" src="http://thebenchapp.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Zev-300x200.jpg" width="300" /></p>
<blockquote><p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="color: #338dc8;"><strong>“We love working with you, you are amazing…Thanks for everything you do.”</strong> </span>— </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Researcher at Gilead Sciences, to Zev</span></i></p></blockquote>
<p><strong>Featured Sourcing Manager:</strong> Zev Wisotsky, Ph.D.</p>
<p><b>Expertise: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Neuroscience</span></p>
<p><b>Why requesters keep coming back to him: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Zev embodies excellence in customer service. That rare combination of empathy, patience, dedication, and hyper-organization comes together in Zev, seasoned with a dash of effortless communication and a sauce of good humor.</span></p>
<p><b>One request he is proud of being able to source: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Zev is particularly proud to have once located some difficult-to-find tuberculosis blood and peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) samples for a client that was not able to find them. This allowed our client to further their research. They were also excited to be able to start their project quickly once they joined Science Exchange.</span></p>
<p><b>How he solved one tough sourcing challenge: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">There was one overseas shipping error where Zev was able to coordinate with the client and service provider to fix and reship samples with minimal extraneous costs and time.</span></p>
<p><b>Experience (education and/or prior roles): </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Zev graduated from University of California Riverside with a degree in Neuroscience, investigating and characterizing the cellular mechanisms involved in taste detection using fruit fly and mosquito. He then completed postdoctoral research at Stanford investigating the role of brain regions involved in fear memory and addiction through silencing different brain circuits optogenetically.</span></p>
<p><b>Likes: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bicycling, singing and playing music</span></p>

<p>A department chair of a Swedish university asked to retract a 2010 study in Diabetes after none of the authors could explain image-related ambiguities. The matter prompted particular attention because the paper’s first author, Pontus Almer Boström, had been found guilty of scientific misconduct by the University of Gothenburg in 2012, after Jan Borén noted some irregularities in […]</p>

<p>Eating disorders (EDs) are severe mental illnesses with a complex and largely unknown etiology. EDs encompass a variety of disorders, including anorexia nervosa, bulimia nervosa, and binge eating disorder. Anorexia nervosa is characterized by self-starving, intense fear of gaining weight and disturbance in self perceived weight or shape. Patients with bulimia nervosa suffer from recurrent binge-eating episodes (the consumption of abnormally large amounts of food in a relatively short period of time) with a sense of loss of control, followed by feelings of guilt and shame, which leads the person to compensatory behaviors (self-induced vomiting, over-exercising, use of laxatives or diuretics). These patients usually maintain normal weight, unlike anorexic ones. Binge eating disorder is characterized by eating excessive amounts of food, often when not hungry, without the compensatory behaviors of bulimia nervosa. As a result, patients are often overweight.</p>

<p>The aetiology of these disorders appears to be multifactorial: genetic, biological, socio-cultural, and psychological factors can contribute to their development and maintenance. The course of EDs is often relapsing and in a substantial proportion of cases protracted with a treatment-resistant disorder sometimes occurring. EDs are severe illnesses for a number of reasons: mortality is high, risk of suicidality is high, quality of life is poor, short- and long-term organic consequences strongly impact patients’ lives, and psychiatric comorbidity (mostly depression, anxiety, and personality disorders) is endemic to sufferers. As a result, EDs tend to appear as a treatment conundrum; although research is proposing interesting novel treatment approaches with encouraging results. Treatments are challenging mostly for anorexia nervosa: no current medications are able to reverse the core symptoms which exist, and long and costly hospitalizations are frequently needed. Duration of illness is a relevant factor in treatment response; adolescents with anorexia nervosa seem to benefit more from outpatient treatments than adults do.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>This said, it is key to recognize ED symptoms as soon as possible because an early intervention could be crucial with respect to treatment response and outcome. If EDs are caught in time, treatments can be decisive to change their course and to reduce the risk of stigma, complications, and death. Primary prevention is fundamental, potentially involving families, teachers and personal trainers, to name just a few. Know what to look for – Weight loss, refusal to eat certain foods, anxiety about gaining weight or being “fat”, excessive and rigid exercise regimens are fundamental first signs of an eating disorder that can be recognized early.</p>

<p>An impressive amount of research has linked frequency of sex with greater happiness. <a href="http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/1948550615616462">One study</a> even put a monetary estimate on it. They said that the happiness spurt from having sex once a week compared with monthly is similar to the boost you’d get from earning an extra $50,000 a year (though for anything more frequent than weekly sex, the benefits seemed to tail off).</p>
<p>Asking if and why more sex makes us happier may sound like asking the blindingly obvious, but of course a lot of pleasurable activities don’t have long-term emotional benefits; it’s also tricky to rule out the simple alternative possibility that we’re more likely to have sex if we’re happy.</p>
<p>In a <a href="http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0146167216684124">series of studies</a> in <em>Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin</em>, psychologists in Switzerland and Canada have looked beyond the immediate bliss that sex can bring, and they say that the main reason that more sex seems to contribute to greater long-term happiness is because of all the cuddling (and other expressions of affection) that’s involved, both at the time, and for hours afterwards.</p>
<p>In <em>Talking It Over</em>, Julian Barnes writes that “Love is just a system for getting someone to call you darling after sex”; this new research suggests that sex is a system for getting someone you love to call you darling, and to give you a big cuddle.</p>
<p><span id="more-19792"></span>Anik Debrot at the University of Fribourg and her colleagues conducted two surveys, the first involving 335 participants, recruited on Amazon’s Mechanical Turk site, who were in a romantic relationship, and the second involving both partners in 74 couples recruited in the San Francisco Bay Area in California. The vast majority of participants were heterosexual. They answered questions about how often they had sex, about how much affectionate touch went on in their relationship (e.g. cuddling, hugging, kissing and caressing) and rated their life satisfaction or how much they typically experienced positive emotions like joy and contentment.</p>
<p>Having more sex was correlated with greater life satisfaction and experiencing more positive emotions, consistent with past research. But when the researchers factored amount of affection into the equation, the sex–happiness link all but disappeared (with one exception – to the researchers’ surprise they found this wasn’t true for women in the second survey). The overall implication of the surveys was that more sex leads to more happiness because it promotes affection.</p>
<p>The researchers also conducted two “experience-sampling” studies.  The first involved 106 couples, most of them married, with children. Each participant kept a diary for ten days, noting their sexual activity, including any erotic moments; their affectionate experiences, including “moments of love and security” and “affectionate or thoughtful signs from my partner”; and their emotions. They kept these records in the morning before work; after work; during the 45 minutes after reunion with their partner; and during the last hour before bed.</p>
<p>Similar to the earlier surveys, this showed that sex in the preceding 24 hours was associated with feeling more positive emotions in the morning, but that this correlation was greatly reduced once affection in the preceding 24 hours was taken into account. In other words, sex seemed to lead to positive emotions because sex tended to go hand with love and cuddles. Indeed, sex without affection was extremely rare (this only happened on 4.2 per cent of occasions according to the diaries).</p>
<p>The researchers also caught up with these couples six months later. More sex during the diary part of the study foretold greater relationship satisfaction all these months later, but only when that earlier sex had been associated with the experience of positive emotions.</p>
<p>A methodological challenge for this topic is that it’s not easy to conduct a controlled experiment in which you instruct participants how much sex or cuddling to get involved in and then look at the effects on their well-being (even if you tried such a study, it wouldn’t exactly be comparable to real-life). To try to get round this, the researchers looked to see whether sex at one time point was associated with more affection later on, which would help support their ideas about how sex promotes affection.</p>
<p>To this end, the final study involved 58 heterosexual couples keeping notes on their sexual activity and affection (defined here as “moments of love and affection”) via a smartphone several times a day for two weeks: at waking, at midday, at 6pm and before going to bed. This showed that when participants reported having sex at one time point, they were more likely to report experiencing affection not just at that time, but also at the next data entry hours later. This still doesn’t prove sex causes affection and that affection causes the happiness that’s previously been linked with sex, but it’s consistent with that interpretation of things.</p>
<p>Debrot and her team said their studies represented a rare attempt to bridge the typically separate fields of sex research and relationship research. “When engaging in sex, people not only seek an intimate connection, but indeed experience more affection, both when having sex and in the next several hours,” they said. “Hence sex seems not only beneficial because of its physiological or hedonic effects, but because it promotes a stronger and more positive connection with the partner.”</p>
<p>They added that their findings could help some couples – for example, at times when sex isn’t possible for whatever reason, the results suggest that making the effort to be affectionate could be beneficial for wellbeing and the relationship. Conversely, the researchers said, “sexual activity might compensate for the diminished well-being in partners having difficulties adequately exchanging affection.”</p>

<p>The study interviewed 17 physician users of social media, but lacked the perspective of a physician blogger. I identified with the study’s themes of Rugged Individualism, Uncertainty, Social Media as Media, and Time Constraints. We in the medical social media world are certainly learning as we go. Without clear paths drawn for us, we explore and contemplate how we will make a positive difference far beyond the reach of the typical physician in a clinic, hospital, or local community.</p>
<p>In this post, I want to add my perspective as a Neonatologist to the findings of the above study, share what drove me to enter this space in medicine, and discuss what I have learned about increasing my sphere of influence in social media circles.</p>
<p><strong>Harnessing the combined power of multiple social media sites</strong></p>
<p>When you begin blogging you soon realise that the method has its limitations in terms of reach. As the above paper suggests, polling of social media users identifies multiple potential websites for both collecting and disseminating information (Facebook, Twitter, Tumblr, Linkedin, Google+ as examples).  Using them in combination can far enhance your reach. At the time of this writing the number of people who “follow” me on each site is quite disparate with Facebook by far leading the way in distribution power:</p>
<table>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td width="312"><strong>Site</strong></td>
<td width="312"><strong>Number of Followers</strong></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width="312">Facebook</td>
<td width="312">13592</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width="312">Twitter</td>
<td width="312">1006</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width="312">WordPress (my primary blogging platform)</td>
<td width="312">456</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>The article also raises concern over the lack of feedback people receive from their postings. With Facebook one cannot determine what was done with your post but on Twitter there is some further delineation as one receives a <a href="http://www.knowledgenudge.com/twitter-metrics-researchers/">tally of impressions, engagements and link clicks</a>. When it comes to real metrics though, this is where the actual blogging site provides more useful data. I recommend embracing metrics, not only to understand your reach but perhaps, just as importantly, to give you the drive to continue your writings.</p>
<p>My most popular post has received 5117 reads, meaning this many took the time to open this blog post to hear what I had to say on the subject. If you were to share your thoughts on an article with colleagues via email, post a new guideline in an office or clinic, or publish an article in a journal, how many people would actually see it? The same information, if cited in a blog post and shared through Facebook, can see a dramatic rise in exposure, along with your interpretation of the work. The aforementioned post for example has had a reach on Facebook of 50934 people to date and was shared 58 times multiplying the distribution many fold. If you published a journal article and were notified of such circulation I suspect you would be jubilant.</p>
<p><strong>What really motivates those who participate in social media?</strong></p>
<p>I believe the motivation lies in the three qualities described by Malcolm Gladwell in his book <em>The Tipping Point</em>. He described three types of people that are needed for something to go from an idea to widespread adoption; connectors, mavens and salesmen. The doctors out there on social media likely have a little bit of all these characteristics.</p>
<p>Gladwell said this about connectors: “They are people who “link us up with the world…people with a special gift for bringing the world together”. With respect to mavens he characterised them as having the ability to “start ‘<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Word_of_mouth">word-of-mouth</a> epidemics’ due to their knowledge, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_skills">social skills</a>, and ability to communicate”. Lastly, salesmen in his view are “persuaders”. These three traits aptly describe those that have waded into this field. They must have the confidence to put their message out there with content that captures people’s attention and certainly have the goal of persuading people that it is worth considering what they have to say. The fundamental drive though comes from a place of harnessing these traits to help people.</p>
<p>Whether writing original content or sharing what others have produced, the social media physician’s goal is generally pure and that is to share knowledge and generate discussion. For example, if you have a new strategy for reducing infection, the active social media physician would ask “why not share this with the world” rather than limit it to your institution or city.</p>
<p>This frontier like field though does come with some caveats before you dip your feet into the collective pool of the various media sites. As opposed to the more traditional medium of peer reviewed publications there is no one to assess your content prior to its release. You are your own editor and therefore may miss the mark from time to time by missing a relevant publication that might influence your conclusions. You must be prepared for the good and the bad. One can easily appreciate the positive comments that often come but not all posts will be “home runs” and on some occasions the feedback (which will be public) may not be what you had hoped for. You must constantly reflect on your own potential biases yet strive to improve base of knowledge; adding more ‘signal’ than ‘noise’. Respect for patient confidentiality is paramount and within Canada and elsewhere, organisations such as the Canadian Medical Association have set <a href="https://www.cma.ca/En/Pages/social-media-use.aspx">guidelines</a> for conduct in this space that should be adhered to.</p>
<p>Once you enter into the fray it may surprise you how much information is in fact out there, that now flows to you through global connections. It is an evolving form of communication and one that I am happy to part of. In fact, I am a better Neonatologist for it.</p>

<p>
 The genus Wolbachia is an archetype of maternally inherited intracellular bacteria that infect the germline of numerous invertebrate species worldwide. They can selfishly alter arthropod sex ratios and reproductive strategies to increase the proportion of the infected matriline in the population. The most common reproductive manipulation is cytoplasmic incompatibility, which results in embryonic lethality in crosses between infected males and uninfected females. Females infected with the same Wolbachia strain rescue this lethality. Despite more than 40 years of research and relevance to symbiont-induced speciation, as well as control of arbovirus vectors and agricultural pests, the bacterial genes underlying cytoplasmic incompatibility remain unknown. Here we use comparative and transgenic approaches to demonstrate that two differentially transcribed, co-diverging genes in the eukaryotic association module of prophage WO from Wolbachia strain wMel recapitulate and enhance cytoplasmic incompatibility. Dual expression in transgenic, uninfected males of Drosophila melanogaster crossed to uninfected females causes embryonic lethality. Each gene additively augments embryonic lethality in crosses between infected males and uninfected females. Lethality associates with embryonic defects that parallel those of wild-type cytoplasmic incompatibility and is notably rescued by wMel-infected embryos in all cases. The discovery of cytoplasmic incompatibility factor genes cifA and cifB pioneers genetic studies of prophage WO-induced reproductive manipulations and informs the continuing use of Wolbachia to control dengue and Zika virus transmission to humans.

<p>
 P53-binding protein 1 (53BP1) is a multi-functional double-strand break repair protein that is essential for class switch recombination in B lymphocytes and for sensitizing BRCA1-deficient tumours to poly-ADP-ribose polymerase-1 (PARP) inhibitors. Central to all 53BP1 activities is its recruitment to double-strand breaks via the interaction of the tandem Tudor domain with dimethylated lysine 20 of histone H4 (H4K20me2). Here we identify an uncharacterized protein, Tudor interacting repair regulator (TIRR), that directly binds the tandem Tudor domain and masks its H4K20me2 binding motif. Upon DNA damage, the protein kinase ataxia-telangiectasia mutated (ATM) phosphorylates 53BP1 and recruits RAP1-interacting factor 1 (RIF1) to dissociate the 53BP1–TIRR complex. However, overexpression of TIRR impedes 53BP1 function by blocking its localization to double-strand breaks. Depletion of TIRR destabilizes 53BP1 in the nuclear-soluble fraction and alters the double-strand break-induced protein complex centring 53BP1. These findings identify TIRR as a new factor that influences double-strand break repair using a unique mechanism of masking the histone methyl-lysine binding function of 53BP1.

Last week, I wrote about a social psychology paper which was retracted after the data turned out to be fraudulent. The sole author on that paper, William Hart, blamed an unnamed graduate student for the misconduct.

Now, more details have emerged about the case. On Tuesday, psychologist Rolf Zwaan blogged about how he was the one who first discovered a problem with Hart's data, in relation to a different paper. Back in 2015, Zwaan had co-authored a paper reporting a failure to replicate a 2011

It involved quite a bit of fiddling but we seemed to get there in the end. In Part II we shall now finish the configuration of the Oracle database and set up the application dependencies. On Part III we will finally get to the Dogen model, and start to make use of ODB. </p> <div class="outline-2" id="outline-container-sec-1"><h2 id="sec-1">What's in a Schema?</h2><div class="outline-text-2" id="text-1"><p>The first thing we need to do to our database is add the "application users". This is a common approach to most server side apps, where we tend to have "service users" that login to the database and act upon user requests on their behalf. We can then use audit tables to stamp the user actions so we can monitor them. We can also have application level permissions that stop users from doing silly things. This is of course a step up from the applications in the nineties, where one would have one database account for each user - allowing all sorts of weird and wonderful things such as users connecting directly to databases via ODBC and Excel or Access. I guess nowadays developers don't even know someone thought this to be a good idea at one point. </p> <p>When I say "database user", most developers exposed to RDBMS' immediately associate this to a user account. This is of course how most databases work, but <i>obviously</i> not so with Oracle. In Oracle, "users" and "schemas" are conflated, so much so it's hard to tell if there is any difference between them. For the purist RDBMS user, a schema is a <i>schema</i> - a collection of tables and other database objects, effectively a namespace - and a user is a <i>user</i> - a person (real or otherwise) that owns database objects. In Oracle these two more or less map to the same concept. So when you create a user, you have created a schema and you can start adding tables to it; and when you refer to database objects, you prefix them by the user name just as you would if they belonged to a schema. And, of course, you can have users that have no database objects for themselves, but which were granted permission to access database objects from other users. </p> <p>So our first task is to create two schemas; these are required by the Dogen model which we will use as our "application". They are: </p> <ul class="org-ul"><li><code>basic</code></li><li><code>northwind</code></li></ul> <p>As I mentioned before, I had created some fairly basic tests for ODB support in Dogen. Those entities were placed in the aptly named schema <code>basic</code>. I then decided to extend the schema with something a bit more meaty, which is where <code>northwind</code> comes in. </p> <p>For the oldest readers, especially those with a Microsoft background, Northwind is bound to conjure memories. Many of us learned Microsoft Access at some point in the nineties, and in those days the samples were pure gold. I was lucky enough to learn about relational databases in my high-school days, using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clipper_(programming_language)">Clipper</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DBase">dBASE IV</a>, so the transition to Microsoft Access was more of an exercise in mapping than learning proper. And that's where Northwind came in. It was a "large" database, with forms and queries and tables and all sorts of weird and wonderful things; every time you needed something done to your database you'd check first to see how Northwind had done it. </p> <p>Now that we are much older, of course, we can see the flaws of Northwind and even <a href="http://www.hanselman.com/blog/CommunityCallToActionNOTNorthwind.aspx">call for its abolition</a>. But you must remember that in the nineties there was no Internet for most of us - even dial-up was pretty rare where I was - and up-to-date IT books were almost as scarce, so samples were like gold dust. So for all of these historic reasons and as an homage to my olden days, I decided to implement the Northwind schema in Dogen and ODB; it may not cover all corner cases, but it is certainly a step up on my previous <code>basic</code> tests. </p> <p>Enough about history and motivations. Returning to our SQLPlus from <a href="http://mcraveiro.blogspot.co.uk/2017/02/nerd-food-northwind-or-using-dogen-with.html">Part I</a>, where we were logged in as <code>SYSTEM</code>, we start first by creating a table space and then the users which will make use of that table space: </p> <pre class="example"><br />SQL&gt; create tablespace tbs_01 datafile 'tbs_f01.dbf' size 200M online;<br /><br />Tablespace created.<br /><br />SQL&gt; create user basic identified by "PASSWORD" default tablespace tbs_01 quota 100M on tbs_01;<br />User created.<br /><br />SQL&gt; create user northwind identified by "PASSWORD" default tablespace tbs_01 quota 100M on tbs_01;<br /><br />User created.<br /></pre> <p>Remember to replace <code>PASSWORD</code> with your own passwords. This is of course a very simple setup; in the real world you would have to take great care setting the users and table spaces up, including thinking about temporary table spaces and so forth. But for our simplistic purposes this suffices. Now we need to grant these users a couple of useful privileges - again, for a real setup, you'd need quite a bit more: </p> <pre class="example"><br />SQL&gt; GRANT create session TO basic;<br />GRANT create session TO basic;<br /><br />Grant succeeded.<br /><br />SQL&gt; GRANT create table TO basic;<br />GRANT create table TO basic;<br /><br />Grant succeeded.<br /><br />SQL&gt; GRANT create session TO northwind;<br />GRANT create session TO northwind;<br /><br />Grant succeeded.<br /><br />SQL&gt; GRANT create table TO northwind;<br />GRANT create table TO northwind;<br /><br />Grant succeeded.<br /></pre> <p>If all went well, we should now be able to exit the <code>SYSTEM</code> session, start a new one with one of these users, and play with a test table: </p> <pre class="example"><br />$ sqlplus northwind@XE<br /><br />SQL*Plus: Release 11.2.0.2.0 Production on Fri Feb 24 10:20:10 2017<br /><br />Copyright (c) 1982, 2011, Oracle.

To recap, we logged in with user <code>northwind</code>, created a table, inserted some random data and selected it back; all looked ok. Then for good measure, we granted the rights to see this test table to user <code>basic</code>; logged in as that user and selected the test table, with the expected results. </p> <p>At this point we consider our Oracle setup completed and we're ready to enter the application world. </p></div></div> <div class="outline-2" id="outline-container-sec-2"><h2 id="sec-2">Enter ODB</h2><div class="outline-text-2" id="text-2"><p>Setting up ODB is fairly easy, especially if you are on Debian: you can simply obtain it from <code>apt-get</code> or <code>synaptic</code>. The only slight snag is, I could not find the oracle dependencies (i.e. <code>libodb-oracle</code>). Likely this is because they depend on OCI, which is non-free, so Debian either does not bother to package it at all or you need some kind of special (non-free) repo for it. As it was, instead of losing myself on wild goose chases, I thought easier to build from source. And since I had to build <i>one</i> from source, might as well build <i>all</i> (or almost all) to demonstrate the whole process from scratch as it is pretty straightforward, really. </p> <p>Before we proceed, one warning: best if you either use your package manager <i>or</i> build from source. You should probably only mix-and-match if you really know what you are doing; if you do and things get tangled up, it may take you a long while to figure out the source of your woes. </p> <p>So, the manual approach. I first started by revisiting my previous notes on building ODB; as it happens, I had covered installing ODB from source previously <a href="http://mcraveiro.blogspot.co.uk/2013/03/nerd-food-installing-latest-stable-odb.html">here</a> for version 2.2. However, those instructions have largely bit-rotted at the Dogen end and things have changed slightly since that post, so a revisit is worthwhile. </p> <p>As usual, we start by grabbing all of the packages from the main <a href="http://www.codesynthesis.com/products/odb/download.xhtml">ODB website</a>: </p> <ul class="org-ul"><li><a href="http://www.codesynthesis.com/download/odb/2.4/odb_2.4.0-1_amd64.deb">odb 2.4.0-1 amd64.deb</a>: the ODB compiler itself. </li><li><a href="http://www.codesynthesis.com/download/odb/2.4/libodb-2.4.0.tar.gz">libodb-2.4.0</a>: the main ODB library, required by all backends. </li><li><a href="http://www.codesynthesis.com/download/odb/2.4/libodb-pgsql-2.4.0.tar.gz">libodb-pgsql-2.4.0</a>: the PostgreSQL backend. We don't need it today, of course, but since PostgreSQL is my DB of choice I always install it. </li><li><a href="http://www.codesynthesis.com/download/odb/2.4/libodb-oracle-2.4.0.tar.gz">libodb-oracle-2.4.0</a>: the Oracle backend. We will need this one. </li><li><a href="http://www.codesynthesis.com/download/odb/2.4/libodb-boost-2.4.0.tar.gz">libodb-boost-2.4.0</a>: the ODB boost profile. This allows using boost types in your Dogen model and having ODB do the right thing in terms of ORM mapping. Our Northwind model does not use boost at present, but I intend to change it as soon as possible as this is a very important feature for customers. </li></ul> <p>Of course, if you are too lazy to click on buttons, just use <code>wget</code>: </p> <pre class="example"><br />$ mkdir odb<br />$ cd odb<br />$ wget http://www.codesynthesis.com/download/odb/2.4/odb_2.4.0-1_amd64.deb -O odb_2.4.0-1_amd64.deb<br />$ wget http://www.codesynthesis.com/download/odb/2.4/libodb-2.4.0.tar.gz -O libodb-2.4.0.tar.gz<br />$ wget http://www.codesynthesis.com/download/odb/2.4/libodb-pgsql-2.4.0.tar.gz -O libodb-pgsql-2.4.0.tar.gz<br />$ wget http://www.codesynthesis.com/download/odb/2.4/libodb-oracle-2.4.0.tar.gz -O libodb-oracle-2.4.0.tar.gz<br />$ wget http://www.codesynthesis.com/download/odb/2.4/libodb-boost-2.4.0.tar.gz -O libodb-boost-2.4.0.tar.gz<br /></pre> <p>We start with the DEB, as simple as always: </p> <pre class="example"><br /># dpkg -i odb_2.4.0-1_amd64.deb<br />Selecting previously unselected package odb.<br />(Reading database ... 549841 files and directories currently installed.)<br />Preparing to unpack odb_2.4.0-1_amd64.deb ...<br />Unpacking odb (2.4.0-1) ...<br />Setting up odb (2.4.0-1) ...<br />Processing triggers for man-db (2.7.6.1-2) ...<br /></pre> <p>I tend to store locally built software under my home directory, so that's where we'll place the libraries: </p> <pre class="example"><br />$ mkdir ~/local<br />$ tar -xaf libodb-2.4.0.tar.gz<br />$ cd libodb-2.4.0/<br />$ ./configure --prefix=/full/path/to/local<br />&lt;snip&gt;<br />make[1]: Leaving directory '/path/to/build/directory/odb/2.4/libodb-2.4.0'<br />$ make install<br />&lt;snip&gt;<br />make[1]: Leaving directory '/path/to/build/directory/odb/2.4/libodb-2.4.0'<br /></pre> <p>Remember to replace <code>/full/path/to/local</code> with your installation directory. The process is similar for the other three packages, with one crucial difference: you need to ensure the environment variables are set to place all required dependencies in the include and link path. This is achieved via the venerable environment variables <code>CPPFLAGS</code> and <code>LDFLAGS</code> (and <code>LD_LIBRARY_PATH</code> as we shall see). You may bump into <code>--with-libodb</code>. However, be careful; the documentation states: </p> <blockquote><p>If these libraries are not installed and you would like to use their build directories instead, you can use the <code>--with-libodb</code>, and <code>--with-boost</code> configure options to specify their locations, for example: </p> <p><code>./configure --with-boost=/tmp/boost</code></p></blockquote> <p>So if you did <code>make install</code>, you need the environment variables instead. </p> <p>Without further ado, here are the shell commands. First boost; do note I am relying on the presence of Debian's system boost; if you have a local build of boost, which is not in the flags below, you will also need to add a path to it. </p> <pre class="example"><br />$ cd ..<br />$ tar -xaf libodb-boost-2.4.0.tar.gz<br />$ cd libodb-boost-2.4.0/<br />$ CPPFLAGS=-I/full/path/to/local/include LDFLAGS=-L/full/path/to/local/lib ./configure --prefix=/full/path/to/local<br />&lt;snip&gt;<br />config.status: executing libtool-rpath-patch commands<br />$ make -j5<br />&lt;snip&gt;<br />make[1]: Leaving directory '/path/to/build/directory/odb/2.4/libodb-boost-2.4.0'<br />$ make install<br />make[1]: Leaving directory '/path/to/build/directory/odb/2.4/libodb-boost-2.4.0'<br /></pre> <p>For PostgreSQL again I am relying on the header files installed in Debian. The commands are: </p> <pre class="example"><br />$ cd ..<br />$ tar -xaf libodb-pgsql-2.4.0.tar.gz<br />$ cd libodb-pgsql-2.4.0/<br />$ CPPFLAGS=-I/full/path/to/local/include LDFLAGS=-L/full/path/to/local/lib ./configure --prefix=/full/path/to/local<br />&lt;snip&gt;<br />config.status: executing libtool-rpath-patch commands<br />$ make -j5<br />&lt;snip&gt;<br />make[1]: Leaving directory '/path/to/build/directory/odb/2.4/libodb-pgsql-2.4.0'<br />$ make install<br />&lt;snip&gt;<br />make[1]: Leaving directory '/path/to/build/directory/odb/2.4/libodb-pgsql-2.4.0'<br /></pre> <p>Finally, Oracle. For this we need to supply the locations of the downloaded drivers or else ODB will not find the Oracle header and libraries. If you recall from the previous post, they are located in <code>/usr/include/oracle/12.1/client64</code> and <code>/usr/lib/oracle/12.1/client64/lib</code>, so we must augment the flags with those two paths. In addition, I found <code>configure</code> was failing with errors finding shared objects, so I added <code>LD_LIBRARY_PATH</code> for good measure. The end result was as follows: </p> <pre class="example"><br />$ cd ..<br />$ tar -xaf libodb-oracle-2.4.0.tar.gz<br />$ cd libodb-oracle-2.4.0<br />$ LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/lib/oracle/12.1/client64/lib CPPFLAGS="-I/full/path/to/local/include -I/usr/include/oracle/12.1/client64" LDFLAGS="-L/full/path/to/local/lib -L/usr/lib/oracle/12.1/client64/lib" ./configure --prefix=/full/path/to/local<br />&lt;snip&gt;<br />config.status: executing libtool-rpath-patch commands<br />$ make -j5<br />&lt;snip&gt;<br />make[1]: Leaving directory '/path/to/build/directory/odb/2.4/libodb-oracle-2.4.0'<br />$ make install<br />&lt;snip&gt;<br />make[1]: Leaving directory '/path/to/build/directory/odb/2.4/libodb-oracle-2.4.0'<br /></pre> <p>And there you are; all libraries built and installed into our local directory, ready to be used. </p></div></div> <div class="outline-2" id="outline-container-sec-3"><h2 id="sec-3">Conclusion</h2><div class="outline-text-2" id="text-3"><p>In this part we've configured the Oracle Express database with the application users, and we sanity checked the configuration.

Nerd Food: Northwind, or Using Dogen with ODB - Part II<div id="content"><p>On <a href="http://mcraveiro.blogspot.co.uk/2017/02/nerd-food-northwind-or-using-dogen-with.html">Part I</a> of this series, we got our Oracle Express database up and running against Debian Testing. It involved quite a bit of fiddling but we seemed to get there in the end. In Part II we shall now finish the configuration of the Oracle database and set up the application dependencies. On Part III we will finally get to the Dogen model, and start to make use of ODB. </p> <div class="outline-2" id="outline-container-sec-1"><h2 id="sec-1">What's in a Schema?</h2><div class="outline-text-2" id="text-1"><p>The first thing we need to do to our database is add the "application users". This is a common approach to most server side apps, where we tend to have "service users" that login to the database and act upon user requests on their behalf. We can then use audit tables to stamp the user actions so we can monitor them. We can also have application level permissions that stop users from doing silly things. This is of course a step up from the applications in the nineties, where one would have one database account for each user - allowing all sorts of weird and wonderful things such as users connecting directly to databases via ODBC and Excel or Access. I guess nowadays developers don't even know someone thought this to be a good idea at one point. </p> <p>When I say "database user", most developers exposed to RDBMs immediately associate this to a user account. This is of course how most databases work, but <i>obviously</i> not so with Oracle. In Oracle, "users" and "schemas" are conflated, so much so it's hard to tell if there is any difference between them. For the purist RDBM user, a schema is a <i>schema</i> - a collection of tables and other database objects, effectively a namespace - and a user is a <i>user</i> - a person (real or otherwise) that owns database objects. In Oracle these two more or less map to the same concept. So when you create a user, you have created a schema and you can start adding tables to it; and when you refer to database objects, you prefix them by the user name just as you would if they belonged to a schema. And, of course, you can have users that have no database objects for themselves, but which were granted permission to access database objects from other users. </p> <p>So our first task is to create two schemas; these are required by the Dogen model which we will use as our "application". They are: </p> <ul class="org-ul"><li><code>basic</code></li><li><code>northwind</code></li></ul> <p>As I mentioned before, I had created some fairly basic tests for ODB support in Dogen. Those entities were placed in the aptly named schema <code>basic</code>. I then decided to extend the schema with something a bit more meaty, which is where <code>northwind</code> comes in. </p> <p>For the oldest readers, especially those with a Microsoft background, Northwind is bound to conjure memories. Many of us learned Microsoft Access at some point in the nineties, and in those days the samples were pure gold. I was lucky enough to learn about relational databases in my high-school days, using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clipper_(programming_language)">Clipper</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DBase">dBASE IV</a>, so the transition to Microsoft Access was more of an exercise in mapping than learning proper. And that's where Northwind came in. It was a "large" database, with forms and queries and tables and all sorts of weird and wonderful things; every time you needed something done to your database you'd check first to see how Northwind had done it. </p> <p>Now that we are much older, of course, we can see the flaws of Northwind and even <a href="http://www.hanselman.com/blog/CommunityCallToActionNOTNorthwind.aspx">call for its abolition</a>. But you must remember that in the nineties there was no Internet for most of us - even dial-up was pretty rare where I was - and up-to-date IT books were almost as scarce, so samples were like gold dust. So for all of these historic reasons and as an homage to my olden days, I decided to implement the Northwind schema in Dogen and ODB; it may not cover all corner cases, but it is certainly a step up on my previous <code>basic</code> tests. </p> <p>Enough about history and motivations. Returning to our SQLPlus from <a href="http://mcraveiro.blogspot.co.uk/2017/02/nerd-food-northwind-or-using-dogen-with.html">Part I</a>, where we were logged in as <code>SYSTEM</code>, we start first by creating a table space and then the users which will make use of that table space: </p> <pre class="example"><br />SQL&gt; create tablespace tbs_01 datafile 'tbs_f01.dbf' size 200M online;<br /><br />Tablespace created.<br /><br />SQL&gt; create user basic identified by "PASSWORD" default tablespace tbs_01 quota 100M on tbs_01;<br />User created.<br /><br />SQL&gt; create user northwind identified by "PASSWORD" default tablespace tbs_01 quota 100M on tbs_01;<br /><br />User created.<br /></pre> <p>Remember to replace <code>PASSWORD</code> with your own passwords. This is of course a very simple setup; in the real world you would have to take great care setting the users and table spaces up, including thinking about temporary table spaces and so forth. But for our simplistic purposes this suffices. Now we need to grant these users a couple of useful privileges - again, for a real setup, you'd need quite a bit more: </p> <pre class="example"><br />SQL&gt; GRANT create session TO basic;<br />GRANT create session TO basic;<br /><br />Grant succeeded.<br /><br />SQL&gt; GRANT create table TO basic;<br />GRANT create table TO basic;<br /><br />Grant succeeded.<br /><br />SQL&gt; GRANT create session TO northwind;<br />GRANT create session TO northwind;<br /><br />Grant succeeded.<br /><br />SQL&gt; GRANT create table TO northwind;<br />GRANT create table TO northwind;<br /><br />Grant succeeded.<br /></pre> <p>If all went well, we should now be able to exit the <code>SYSTEM</code> session, start a new one with one of these users, and play with a test table: </p> <pre class="example"><br />$ sqlplus northwind@XE<br /><br />SQL*Plus: Release 11.2.0.2.0 Production on Fri Feb 24 10:20:10 2017<br /><br />Copyright (c) 1982, 2011, Oracle.

To recap, we logged in with user <code>northwind</code>, created a table, inserted some random data and selected it back; all looked ok. Then for good measure, we granted the rights to see this test table to user <code>basic</code>; logged in as that user and selected the test table, with the expected results. </p> <p>At this point we consider our Oracle setup completed and we're ready to enter the application world. </p></div></div> <div class="outline-2" id="outline-container-sec-2"><h2 id="sec-2">Enter ODB</h2><div class="outline-text-2" id="text-2"><p>Setting up ODB is fairly easy, especially if you are on Debian: you can simply obtain it from <code>apt-get</code> or <code>synaptic</code>. The only slight snag is, I could not find the oracle dependencies (i.e. <code>libodb-oracle</code>). Likely this is because they depend on OCI, which is non-free, so Debian either does not bother to package it at all or you need some kind of special (non-free) repo for it. As it was, instead of losing myself on wild goose chases, I thought easier to build from source. And since I had to build <i>one</i> from source, might as well build <i>all</i> (or almost all) to demonstrate the whole process from scratch as it is pretty straightforward, really. </p> <p>Before we proceed, one warning: when it comes to the libraries, best if you either use your package manager <i>or</i> build from source. You should probably only mix-and-match if you really know what you are doing; if you do and things get tangled up, it may take you a long while to figure out the source of your woes. Note also that this warning applies to the support libraries but not to the ODB compiler itself. </p> <p>So, the manual approach. I first started by revisiting my previous notes on building ODB; as it happens, I had covered installing ODB from source previously <a href="http://mcraveiro.blogspot.co.uk/2013/03/nerd-food-installing-latest-stable-odb.html">here</a> for version 2.2. However, those instructions have largely bit-rotted at the Dogen end and things have changed slightly since that post, so a revisit is worthwhile. </p> <p>As usual, we start by grabbing all of the packages from the main <a href="http://www.codesynthesis.com/products/odb/download.xhtml">ODB website</a>: </p> <ul class="org-ul"><li><a href="http://www.codesynthesis.com/download/odb/2.4/odb_2.4.0-1_amd64.deb">odb 2.4.0-1 amd64.deb</a>: the ODB compiler itself. </li><li><a href="http://www.codesynthesis.com/download/odb/2.4/libodb-2.4.0.tar.gz">libodb-2.4.0</a>: the main ODB library, required by all backends. </li><li><a href="http://www.codesynthesis.com/download/odb/2.4/libodb-pgsql-2.4.0.tar.gz">libodb-pgsql-2.4.0</a>: the PostgreSQL backend. We don't need it today, of course, but since PostgreSQL is my DB of choice I always install it. </li><li><a href="http://www.codesynthesis.com/download/odb/2.4/libodb-oracle-2.4.0.tar.gz">libodb-oracle-2.4.0</a>: the Oracle backend. We will need this one. </li><li><a href="http://www.codesynthesis.com/download/odb/2.4/libodb-boost-2.4.0.tar.gz">libodb-boost-2.4.0</a>: the ODB boost profile. This allows using boost types in your Dogen model and having ODB do the right thing in terms of ORM mapping. Our Northwind model does not use boost at present, but I intend to change it as soon as possible as this is a very important feature for customers. </li></ul> <p>Of course, if you are too lazy to click on links, just use <code>wget</code>: </p> <pre class="example"><br />$ mkdir odb<br />$ cd odb<br />$ wget http://www.codesynthesis.com/download/odb/2.4/odb_2.4.0-1_amd64.deb -O odb_2.4.0-1_amd64.deb<br />$ wget http://www.codesynthesis.com/download/odb/2.4/libodb-2.4.0.tar.gz -O libodb-2.4.0.tar.gz<br />$ wget http://www.codesynthesis.com/download/odb/2.4/libodb-pgsql-2.4.0.tar.gz -O libodb-pgsql-2.4.0.tar.gz<br />$ wget http://www.codesynthesis.com/download/odb/2.4/libodb-oracle-2.4.0.tar.gz -O libodb-oracle-2.4.0.tar.gz<br />$ wget http://www.codesynthesis.com/download/odb/2.4/libodb-boost-2.4.0.tar.gz -O libodb-boost-2.4.0.tar.gz<br /></pre> <p>We start with the DEB, as simple as always: </p> <pre class="example"><br /># dpkg -i odb_2.4.0-1_amd64.deb<br />Selecting previously unselected package odb.<br />(Reading database ... 549841 files and directories currently installed.)<br />Preparing to unpack odb_2.4.0-1_amd64.deb ...<br />Unpacking odb (2.4.0-1) ...<br />Setting up odb (2.4.0-1) ...<br />Processing triggers for man-db (2.7.6.1-2) ...<br /></pre> <p>I tend to store locally built software under my home directory, so that's where we'll place the libraries: </p> <pre class="example"><br />$ mkdir ~/local<br />$ tar -xaf libodb-2.4.0.tar.gz<br />$ cd libodb-2.4.0/<br />$ ./configure --prefix=/full/path/to/local<br />&lt;snip&gt;<br />make[1]: Leaving directory '/path/to/build/directory/odb/2.4/libodb-2.4.0'<br />$ make install<br />&lt;snip&gt;<br />make[1]: Leaving directory '/path/to/build/directory/odb/2.4/libodb-2.4.0'<br /></pre> <p>Remember to replace <code>/full/path/to/local</code> with your installation directory. The process is similar for the other three packages, with one crucial difference: you need to ensure the environment variables are set to place all required dependencies in the include and link path. This is achieved via the venerable environment variables <code>CPPFLAGS</code> and <code>LDFLAGS</code> (and <code>LD_LIBRARY_PATH</code> as we shall see). You may bump into <code>--with-libodb</code>. However, be careful; the documentation states: </p> <blockquote><p>If these libraries are not installed and you would like to use their build directories instead, you can use the <code>--with-libodb</code>, and <code>--with-boost</code> configure options to specify their locations, for example: </p> <p><code>./configure --with-boost=/tmp/boost</code></p></blockquote> <p>So if you did <code>make install</code>, you need the environment variables instead. </p> <p>Without further ado, here are the shell commands. First boost; do note I am relying on the presence of Debian's system boost; if you have a local build of boost, which is not in the flags below, you will also need to add a path to it. </p> <pre class="example"><br />$ cd ..<br />$ tar -xaf libodb-boost-2.4.0.tar.gz<br />$ cd libodb-boost-2.4.0/<br />$ CPPFLAGS=-I/full/path/to/local/include LDFLAGS=-L/full/path/to/local/lib ./configure --prefix=/full/path/to/local<br />&lt;snip&gt;<br />config.status: executing libtool-rpath-patch commands<br />$ make -j5<br />&lt;snip&gt;<br />make[1]: Leaving directory '/path/to/build/directory/odb/2.4/libodb-boost-2.4.0'<br />$ make install<br />make[1]: Leaving directory '/path/to/build/directory/odb/2.4/libodb-boost-2.4.0'<br /></pre> <p>For PostgreSQL again I am relying on the header files installed in Debian. The commands are: </p> <pre class="example"><br />$ cd ..<br />$ tar -xaf libodb-pgsql-2.4.0.tar.gz<br />$ cd libodb-pgsql-2.4.0/<br />$ CPPFLAGS=-I/full/path/to/local/include LDFLAGS=-L/full/path/to/local/lib ./configure --prefix=/full/path/to/local<br />&lt;snip&gt;<br />config.status: executing libtool-rpath-patch commands<br />$ make -j5<br />&lt;snip&gt;<br />make[1]: Leaving directory '/path/to/build/directory/odb/2.4/libodb-pgsql-2.4.0'<br />$ make install<br />&lt;snip&gt;<br />make[1]: Leaving directory '/path/to/build/directory/odb/2.4/libodb-pgsql-2.4.0'<br /></pre> <p>Finally, Oracle. For this we need to supply the locations of the downloaded drivers or else ODB will not find the Oracle header and libraries. If you recall from the previous post, they are located in <code>/usr/include/oracle/12.1/client64</code> and <code>/usr/lib/oracle/12.1/client64/lib</code>, so we must augment the flags with those two paths. In addition, I found <code>configure</code> was failing with errors finding shared objects, so I added <code>LD_LIBRARY_PATH</code> for good measure. The end result was as follows: </p> <pre class="example"><br />$ cd ..<br />$ tar -xaf libodb-oracle-2.4.0.tar.gz<br />$ cd libodb-oracle-2.4.0<br />$ LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/lib/oracle/12.1/client64/lib CPPFLAGS="-I/full/path/to/local/include -I/usr/include/oracle/12.1/client64" LDFLAGS="-L/full/path/to/local/lib -L/usr/lib/oracle/12.1/client64/lib" ./configure --prefix=/full/path/to/local<br />&lt;snip&gt;<br />config.status: executing libtool-rpath-patch commands<br />$ make -j5<br />&lt;snip&gt;<br />make[1]: Leaving directory '/path/to/build/directory/odb/2.4/libodb-oracle-2.4.0'<br />$ make install<br />&lt;snip&gt;<br />make[1]: Leaving directory '/path/to/build/directory/odb/2.4/libodb-oracle-2.4.0'<br /></pre> <p>And there you are; all libraries built and installed into our local directory, ready to be used. </p></div></div> <div class="outline-2" id="outline-container-sec-3"><h2 id="sec-3">Conclusion</h2><div class="outline-text-2" id="text-3"><p>In this part we've configured the Oracle Express database with the application users, and we sanity checked the configuration.

<p><em>By guest blogger</em> <a href="https://psychiatrie.charite.de/fileadmin/user_upload/microsites/m_cc15/psychiatrie/Mitarbeiter/cvs/Hasselmann/CV_Hasselmann.pdf">Helge Hasselmann</a></p>
<p>While autism is usually diagnosed in childhood, some people remain “off the radar” for a long time and only receive a diagnosis much later. One possible reason is that they have learned socially appropriate behaviours, effectively camouflaging their social difficulties, including maintaining eye contact during conversations, memorising jokes or imitating facial expressions.</p>
<p>This pattern of behaviour could have serious consequences for the lives of some people with autism. It is easy to imagine that camouflaging demands significant cognitive effort, leading to mental exhaustion over time, and in extreme cases perhaps also contributing to anxiety and depression.</p>
<p>If there are gender differences in camouflaging, this could also help explain the well-known male preponderance in autism spectrum disorders. At least part of the gender imbalance may, in fact, stem from an under-diagnosis of autism in girls because they are better at “masking” symptoms.</p>
<p>Before now, autism camouflaging has not been studied in a systematic and standardised manner: <a href="http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/1362361316671012?url_ver=Z39.88-2003&amp;rfr_id=ori:rid:crossref.org&amp;rfr_dat=cr_pub%3dpubmed">a recent open-access study</a> in the journal <em>Autism</em>, by Meng-Chuan Lai and his colleagues, is the first to offer an operationalisation of camouflaging, which they define as the discrepancy between internal and external states in social-interpersonal contexts. For instance, if an autistic person maintains eye contact during a conversation because they have learnt that this is socially appropriate, even though this clashes with how they really want to behave, this would be an example of camouflaging.</p>
<p><span id="more-19729"></span></p>
<p>Lai and his colleagues used clinical instruments that are well established in autism research to measure the contrast between internal and external signs of autism among 30 women and 30 men with an established diagnosis of autism. Both gender groups were matched on age (average age: males 27.2 years and females 27.8 years) and intelligence and were free from intellectual disability.</p>
<p>The researchers used the Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule (ADOS), which includes several tasks requiring social interaction with an experimenter, to measure overt behaviour (external state). And they used the Autism Spectrum Quotient (ASQ; a questionnaire assessing autistic traits) and the “Reading the Mind in the Eyes” test (a computerised task that measures social cognitive ability, e.g. inferring how people feel based on their facial expression) to provide information about internal states. Relatively low scores on the ADOS (i.e. few signs of autism), combined with poor performance on the ASQ and the Reading the Mind in The Eyes, was taken as a sign of camouflaging.</p>
<p>Because camouflaging likely comes at considerable cognitive and emotional costs, the researchers also studied their participants’ levels of anxiety and depression, as well as their executive function. Finally, they also used magnetic resonance imaging to scan the structure of their participants’ brains.</p>
<p>As the researchers expected, women with autism had significantly higher camouflaging scores than their male counterparts, although there was considerable variability in both groups. Across the whole sample, higher camouflaging scores were associated with higher levels of depression, but not anxiety. When looking at gender differences, the association between camouflaging and depression remained significant only in the men (so it could be speculated that men are more susceptible to the negative consequences of camouflaging). Conversely, verbal intelligence was not associated with camouflaging in either the whole sample or genders separately. Interestingly, camouflaging correlated with executive function in females, but not males. This indicated that women who camouflaged more tended to have better executive function.</p>
<p>The extent to which individuals with autism engaged in camouflaging was not related to their age. This indicates that camouflaging may not necessarily increase with greater learning experience, as might be expected with older age.</p>
<p>Neuroanatomical findings differed between sexes, with links between brain structure and camouflaging generally more pronounced in the women. For instance, higher camouflaging was associated with smaller volume in temporal, cerebellar and occipital brain regions in women, but not in men. While there is no easy explanation for this sex difference, it could be speculated that the involved brain areas have a different function in camouflaging for women compared with men. These brain regions are associated with emotional processing, so perhaps they are involved in an emotional component of camouflaging that is more relevant to women. However, this needs to be rigorously examined in future studies.</p>
<p>This study is the first to offer systematic, methodologically sound evidence in support of higher camouflaging in women than men with autism. As such, these results support reports from parents or clinicians that hint at better social skills in girls with autism as compared with boys. However, as the study found evidence of men who engaged in camouflaging and women who did not, camouflaging is unlikely to constitute a uniquely female presentation of autism.</p>
<p>There are several points that limit the scope of this study. First, the sample size was modest and only included individuals with an established diagnosis of autism who were free from intellectual disability. To study the “real world” implications of camouflaging, it would have been interesting to study people with sub-threshold autistic scores because camouflaging might be one of the reasons why they have remained below diagnostic threshold in the first place. This information might also be relevant for healthcare professionals in terms of both diagnosis and treatment.</p>
<p>Finally, the operationalization of camouflaging may be vulnerable to subjective bias: For example, ADOS raters may be guided by implicit gender stereotypes, leading them to give inappropriately high autism scores to girls who behave in more “boyish” ways.</p>
<p>To conclude, this study provides the first systematic definition of camouflaging in individuals with autism and shows that this behaviour is more common in women than men. These clear-cut gender differences highlight the need to consider camouflaging in clinical contexts in the future.</p>

Nerd Food: Northwind, or Using Dogen with ODB - Part I<div id="content"><p>Thanks to my first <a href="https://github.com/DomainDrivenConsulting/dogen">Dogen</a> paying customer, I finally got a chance to work with <a href="http://www.codesynthesis.com/products/odb/">ODB</a> - <a href="http://www.codesynthesis.com">Code Synthesis'</a> amazingly interesting C++ Object-Relational Mapping tool, built on the back of the GCC plugin system. I've personally always been in awe of what Boris Kolpackov has achieved, and, of course, it being a South African company made me all the more keen to use their products. More importantly: the product just seems to rock in terms of polish, features and documentation. </p> <p>Astute readers of this blog will point out that Dogen has been supporting ODB for quite some time. That is indeed true, but since I haven't used this feature in anger, I wasn't sure how good the support really was; our fairly trivial database model (<a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DomainDrivenConsulting/dogen/master/projects/input_models/database.dia">Dia</a>) explored only a small fraction of what is possible. Now that I finally had a chance to use it in production, I needed to expand the tests and try to replicate the customer's scenario as close as possible. As always in these situations, there was a snag: instead of using <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/">PostgreSQL</a> - the RDBMS I had originally used in my Dogen tests - they were using Oracle. So my first task was to setup Oracle locally on my beloved Debian Linux. </p> <p>Never one to miss an opportunity, I decided this adventure was worthy of a quick blog post; it soon turned out to be a series of posts, if I was to do any justice to this strange and wild experiment, through all of its twists and turns. But hopefully it is worth the effort, as it also demonstrates what you can do with Dogen and ODB. And so, here we are. </p> <p>The first part of the series deals with just trying to convince Oracle to run on Debian Testing - something that <i>obviously</i> Oracle does not support out of the box. </p> <p>Before we proceed, a word to the wise: this is a <b>highly experimental</b>Oracle setup, which I embarked upon just because I could; follow it at your own peril, and <b>do not use it anywhere near production</b>. More generally, if you want to stick to the beaten track, use Oracle on RHEL, CentOS or - god forbid - even Windows. All of that said, if like me, you are a Debian person, well, there's not much for it other than to fire off a VM and start looking for those damned faint tracks in the jungle. </p> <div class="outline-2" id="outline-container-sec-1"><h2 id="sec-1">Alien Worlds</h2><div class="outline-text-2" id="text-1"><p>The very first stumbling block was Oracle itself. After all, for all the many years of using this RBDMS at work - more than I care to admit in polite company - I suddenly realised I actually never used it at home. Or course, Oracle has supported Linux for a little while now; and the good news is they have a "free" version available: Oracle Database Express Edition (XE). A quick glance at the Oracle website revealed RPM's for 64-bits (Intel only, of course). So before anything else, I decided to brush up my knowledge of Alien. </p> <p>Alien is a debian package that converts RPMs into DEBs. I've used it in the past for another (lovely) Oracle technology: Java. It had worked wonderfully well then so I thought I'd give it a try. The <a href="https://help.ubuntu.com/community/RPM/AlienHowto">Ubuntu Alien HowTo</a> is pretty straightforward, and so is <a href="https://wiki.debian.org/Alien">Debian's</a>. Basically, obtain Alien: </p> <pre class="example"><br />sudo apt-get install alien<br /></pre> <p>And then apply it to the RPM in question. So the next quest was obtaining those darn RPMs. </p> <p>Of course, once you move away from the easy world of Free and Open Source Software, things start to get a bit more complicated. Those lovely links you can easy Google for don't actually work until you sign up for an Oracle developer account, asking <i>all sorts</i> of personal information. Sadly, even listening to Tesla earnings conferences requires registering these days. Undaunted, I filled all required fields, obtained my developer account and returned to download my loot. For Oracle Express it's rather straightforward: there is a grand-total of one package for Linux 64-bit, so you can't really go wrong. Here's the link, just in case: </p> <ul class="org-ul"><li><a href="http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/database/database-technologies/express-edition/downloads/index.html">Oracle Express</a>: download the 64-bit Linux RPM <code>oracle-xe-11.2.0-1.0.x86_64.rpm.zip</code>. </li></ul> <p>It is interesting that they decided to zip the RPM but you can easily unzip it with the <code>unzip</code> tool. The contents are the RPM Alien expects, plus a few oracle specific files which I decided to ignore for now: </p> <pre class="example"><br />$ unzip oracle-xe-11.2.0-1.0.x86_64.rpm.zip<br />Archive:  oracle-xe-11.2.0-1.0.x86_64.rpm.zip<br />   creating: Disk1/<br />   creating: Disk1/upgrade/<br />  inflating: Disk1/upgrade/gen_inst.sql<br />   creating: Disk1/response/<br />  inflating: Disk1/response/xe.rsp<br />  inflating: Disk1/oracle-xe-11.2.0-1.0.x86_64.rpm<br /></pre> <p>From a quick glance at the instructions, it appeared the Oracle Express package contained just the database server - that meant it did not include a command line client, or the APIs to build applications that talk to the database. To be fair, this is not an entirely uncommon approach; Debian also packages the PostgreSQL server separately from the development libraries. But behind <code>apt-get</code> and <code>synaptic</code>, installation of packages is all so trivial. Not so when you have to go through lots of detailed explanations of different packages and variations. But; onwards! In the <a href="http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/topics/linuxx86-64soft-092277.html">Instant client</a> page, I settled on the downloading the following: </p> <ul class="org-ul"><li><i>Basic</i>: client shared libraries. Package: <code>oracle-instantclient12.1-basic-12.1.0.2.0-1.x86_64.rpm</code></li><li><i>SQL Plus</i>: command-line client. Package: <code>oracle-instantclient12.1-sqlplus-12.1.0.2.0-1.x86_64.rpm</code></li><li><i>SDK</i>: header files to compile code. Package: <code>oracle-instantclient12.1-devel-12.1.0.2.0-1.x86_64.rpm</code></li></ul> <p><b>Update</b>: As it turns out, I was wrong on my original expectations, and you don't really need the SQL Plus package - its already included with Oracle Express. But I only figured it out much later, so I'll leave the steps as I originally followed them. </p> <p>With all of these packages in hand, I swiftly got busy with Alien, only to also rather swiftly hit an issue: </p> <pre class="example"><br />$ cd Disk1<br />$ alien --scripts oracle-xe-11.2.0-1.0.x86_64.rpm<br />Must run as root to convert to deb format (or you may use fakeroot).<br /></pre> <p>Yes, sadly you cannot run alien directly as an unprivileged user. I did not wish to start reading up on <a href="https://wiki.debian.org/FakeRoot">FakeRoot</a> - seems straightforward enough, to be fair, but hey - so I took the easy way out and ran all the Alien commands as root. Note also the <code>--scripts</code> to ensure the scripts will also get converted across. This will bring us some other… interesting issues, shall we say, but seems worthwhile doing. </p> <p>Quite a few seconds later (hey, it was a 300 MB RPM!), a nice looking DEB was generated: </p> <pre class="example"><br /># alien --scripts oracle-xe-11.2.0-1.0.x86_64.rpm<br />oracle-xe_11.2.0-2_amd64.deb generated<br /></pre> <p>A rather promising start. For good measure, I repeated the process with all RPMs, all with similar results: </p> <pre class="example"><br /># alien oracle-instantclient12.1-basic_12.1.0.2.0-2_amd64.deb<br />oracle-instantclient12.1-basic_12.1.0.2.0-2_amd64.deb generated<br /><br /># alien oracle-instantclient12.1-sqlplus-12.1.0.2.0-1.x86_64.rpm<br />oracle-instantclient12.1-sqlplus_12.1.0.2.0-2_amd64.deb generated<br /><br /># alien  oracle-instantclient12.1-devel-12.1.0.2.0-1.x86_64.rpm<br />oracle-instantclient12.1-devel_12.1.0.2.0-2_amd64.deb generated<br /></pre> <p>Voila, all DEBs generated. Of course, as the English love to say, the proof is in the pudding - whatever that means, exactly. So before one can celebrate, you should try to install the generated packages. That can be easily done with our old trusty <code>dpkg</code>: </p> <pre class="example"><br /># dpkg -i oracle-xe_11.2.0-2_amd64.deb<br />Selecting previously unselected package oracle-xe.<br />(Reading database ... 564824 files and directories currently installed.)<br />Preparing to unpack oracle-xe_11.2.0-2_amd64.deb ...<br />Unpacking oracle-xe (11.2.0-2) ...<br />Setting up oracle-xe (11.2.0-2) ...<br />Executing post-install steps...<br />/var/lib/dpkg/info/oracle-xe.postinst: line 114: /sbin/chkconfig: No such file or directory<br />You must run '/etc/init.d/oracle-xe configure' as the root user to configure the database.<br /><br />Processing triggers for libc-bin (2.24-8) ...<br />Processing triggers for systemd (232-8) ...<br />Processing triggers for desktop-file-utils (0.23-1) ...<br />Processing triggers for gnome-menus (3.13.3-8) ...<br />Processing triggers for mime-support (3.60) ...<br />Processing triggers for mime-support (3.60) ...<br /></pre> <p>As it turns out, it seems the error for chkconfig is related to setting up the service to  autostart. Since this was not a key requirement for my purposes, I decided to ignore it. The remaining RPMs - or should I say DEBs - installed beautifully: </p> <pre class="example"><br /># dpkg -i oracle-instantclient12.1-basic_12.1.0.2.0-2_amd64.deb<br />Selecting previously unselected package oracle-instantclient12.1-basic.<br />(Reading database ... 564801 files and directories currently installed.)<br />Preparing to unpack oracle-instantclient12.1-basic_12.1.0.2.0-2_amd64.deb ...<br />Unpacking oracle-instantclient12.1-basic (12.1.0.2.0-2) ...<br />Setting up oracle-instantclient12.1-basic (12.1.0.2.0-2) ...<br />Processing triggers for libc-bin (2.24-8) ...<br /></pre> <pre class="example"><br /># dpkg -i oracle-instantclient12.1-sqlplus_12.1.0.2.0-2_amd64.deb<br />Selecting previously unselected package oracle-instantclient12.1-sqlplus.<br />(Reading database ... 567895 files and directories currently installed.)<br />Preparing to unpack oracle-instantclient12.1-sqlplus_12.1.0.2.0-2_amd64.deb ...<br />Unpacking oracle-instantclient12.1-sqlplus (12.1.0.2.0-2) ...<br />Setting up oracle-instantclient12.1-sqlplus (12.1.0.2.0-2) ...<br /></pre> <pre class="example"><br /># dpkg -i oracle-instantclient12.1-devel_12.1.0.2.0-2_amd64.deb<br />Selecting previously unselected package oracle-instantclient12.1-devel.<br />(Reading database ... 567903 files and directories currently installed.)<br />Preparing to unpack oracle-instantclient12.1-devel_12.1.0.2.0-2_amd64.deb ...<br />Unpacking oracle-instantclient12.1-devel (12.1.0.2.0-2) ...<br />Setting up oracle-instantclient12.1-devel (12.1.0.2.0-2) ...<br /></pre></div></div> <div class="outline-2" id="outline-container-sec-2"><h2 id="sec-2">Talking to the Oracle</h2><div class="outline-text-2" id="text-2"><p>So, at this point in time we have a bunch of stuff installed in all sorts of random (read: Oracle-like) locations. The database itself is under <code>/u01/app/oracle/product/11.2.0/</code>, and all the other packages seemed to have gone into <code>/usr/lib/oracle/12.1/client64/</code> and <code>/usr/include/oracle/12.1/client64/</code>. The first task is now to start the database server. For this we can rely on the scripts we installed earlier on. However, before we proceed, one little spoiler: we need to ensure the scripts can find <code>awk</code> at <code>/bin/awk</code> (these days it lives in <code>/usr/bin/awk</code>). For this we can do a swift (and brutal) hack: </p> <pre class="example"><br /># ln -s /usr/bin/awk /bin/awk<br /></pre> <p>Now we can configure it. I accepted all of the defaults, and setup a suitably sensible password: </p> <pre class="example"><br /># cd /etc/init.d/<br /># /etc/init.d/oracle-xe configure<br /><br />Oracle Database 11g Express Edition Configuration<br />-------------------------------------------------<br />This will configure on-boot properties of Oracle Database 11g Express<br />Edition.  The following questions will determine whether the database should<br />be starting upon system boot, the ports it will use, and the passwords that<br />will be used for database accounts.  Press &lt;Enter&gt; to accept the defaults.<br />Ctrl-C will abort.<br /><br />Specify the HTTP port that will be used for Oracle Application Express [8080]:<br /><br />Specify a port that will be used for the database listener [1521]:<br /><br />Specify a password to be used for database accounts.  Note that the same<br />password will be used for SYS and SYSTEM.  Oracle recommends the use of<br />different passwords for each database account.  This can be done after<br />initial configuration:<br /><br />Confirm the password:<br /><br /><br />Do you want Oracle Database 11g Express Edition to be started on boot (y/n) [y]:y<br />y<br /><br />Starting Oracle Net Listener...Done<br />Configuring database...<br />Starting Oracle Database 11g Express Edition instance...Done<br />Installation completed successfully.<br /></pre> <p>Notice how your port 8080 has been hogged. If you are using it for other work, you may need to move the Oracle Application Express server to some other port. At any rate, after this I could indeed see a whole load of Oracle processes running: </p> <pre class="example"><br />$ ps -ef | grep oracle<br />oracle   20228     1  0 22:35 ?        00:00:00 /u01/app/oracle/product/11.2.0/xe/bin/tnslsnr LISTENER -inhe<br />oracle   21251     1  0 22:36 ?        00:00:00 xe_pmon_XE<br />oracle   21253     1  0 22:36 ?        00:00:00 xe_psp0_XE<br />oracle   21257     1  0 22:36 ?        00:00:00 xe_vktm_XE<br />oracle   21261     1  0 22:36 ?        00:00:00 xe_gen0_XE<br />oracle   21263     1  0 22:36 ?        00:00:00 xe_diag_XE<br />oracle   21265     1  0 22:36 ?        00:00:00 xe_dbrm_XE<br />oracle   21267     1  0 22:36 ?        00:00:00 xe_dia0_XE<br />oracle   21269     1  0 22:36 ?        00:00:00 xe_mman_XE<br />oracle   21271     1  0 22:36 ?        00:00:00 xe_dbw0_XE<br />oracle   21273     1  0 22:36 ?        00:00:00 xe_lgwr_XE<br />...<br /></pre> <p>To the untrained eye, this seems like a healthy start; but for more details, there are also a bunch of useful logs under the Oracle directories: </p> <pre class="example"><br /># ls -l /u01/app/oracle/product/11.2.0/xe/config/log<br />ls -l /u01/app/oracle/product/11.2.0/xe/config/log<br />total 20<br />-rw-r--r-- 1 oracle dba 1369 Feb 23 22:36 CloneRmanRestore.log<br />-rw-r--r-- 1 oracle dba 7377 Feb 23 22:36 cloneDBCreation.log<br />-rw-r--r-- 1 oracle dba 1278 Feb 23 22:36 postDBCreation.log<br />-rw-r--r-- 1 oracle dba  227 Feb 23 22:36 postScripts.log<br /></pre> <p>Now, at this point in time, if all had gone according to plan we should be able to connect to our new instance. A typical trick in Oracle is to use <code>tnsping</code> to validate the setup. For this we need to know what to ping, and that is where <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/database/121/NETRF/tnsnames.htm#NETRF260">TNS Names</a> comes in handy: </p> <pre class="example"><br />$ cat /u01/app/oracle/product/11.2.0/xe/network/admin/tnsnames.ora<br /># tnsnames.ora Network Configuration File:<br /><br />XE =<br />  (DESCRIPTION =<br />    (ADDRESS = (PROTOCOL = TCP)(HOST = lorenz)(PORT = 1521))<br />    (CONNECT_DATA =<br />      (SERVER = DEDICATED)<br />      (SERVICE_NAME = XE)<br />    )<br />  )<br />...<br /></pre> <p>The magic word is <code>XE</code> (the net service name, i.e. what we will be connecting against). Now we can simply do: </p> <pre class="example"><br />$ . /u01/app/oracle/product/11.2.0/xe/bin/oracle_env.sh<br />$ tnsping XE<br /><br />TNS Ping Utility for Linux: Version 11.2.0.2.0 - Production on 23-FEB-2017 22:52:04<br /><br />Copyright (c) 1997, 2011, Oracle.

Worth noticing that the first step was to call <code>oracle_env.sh</code> to bring in all the required environment variables of our Oracle setup. </p> <p>The final test at this stage is to ensure we can connect with SQL Plus. For this we will just rely on the <code>SYSTEM</code> user. </p> <pre class="example"><br />$ sqlplus SYSTEM@XE<br /><br />SQL*Plus: Release 11.2.0.2.0 Production on Thu Feb 23 22:56:31 2017<br /><br />Copyright (c) 1982, 2011, Oracle.

We have an absolutely minimal, bare-bones setup of Oracle Express running on Debian Linux. Worth bearing in mind that if you want to make use of SQL Plus from within emacs you must make sure you start emacs on a shell that has all the variables defined in <code>oracle_env.sh</code>. </p></div></div> <div class="outline-2" id="outline-container-sec-3"><h2 id="sec-3">Conclusions</h2><div class="outline-text-2" id="text-3"><p>In this first part we simply setup Oracle Express, and the client libraries. We also managed to prove that the setup is vaguely working by connecting to it first at a low-level via TNS ping and then at a proper client level using SQL Plus. The next part will wrap things up with the Oracle setup and then move on to ODB. </p></div></div></div><div class="status" id="postamble"><p class="date">Created: 2017-02-23 Thu 23:36</p><p class="creator"><a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/">Emacs</a> 25.1.1 (<a href="http://orgmode.org">Org</a> mode 8.2.10)</p><p class="validation"><a href="http://validator.w3.org/check?uri=referer">Validate</a></p></div>

<img alt="OldManWine" class="attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image" height="150" src="http://blogs.plos.org/neuro/files/2017/02/OldManWine-150x150.jpg" style="display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;" width="150" /><p>Wisdom and grace come with age, but so do mental slowing and increased risk for dementia. As the elderly population continues to grow, preserving brain health to maintain independence and quality of life into older age is a pressing concern. Researchers have identified some unsurprising factors that reduce one’s risk for cognitive decline, including <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4099157/" target="_blank">education, exercise or a healthy diet</a>. But a more controversial question that continues to perplex scientists is whether alcohol consumption might also stave off cognitive impairment with age.</p>
<p><strong>The aging brain on alcohol</strong></p>
<p>Anyone who’s experienced the fatigue and brain fog that follow a night of heavy drinking doesn’t need science to explain the dangers of excessive alcohol intake. These health risks may be especially impactful to the older brain, which is already particularly vulnerable to environmental stressors. However, in moderation, a glass of wine or beer may not only be harmless, but may in fact also confer resilience to the aging brain against cognitive decline. Numerous studies have reported that moderate drinking is associated with <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19546653" target="_blank">lower rates of dementia</a>, <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27184039" target="_blank">better cognitive performance</a>, and slower decline in <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15659724" target="_blank">memory</a> and <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16247047" target="_blank">executive functions</a>. Yet, not all studies support the notion that a nightcap can help keep the brain sharp into late life. These discrepant findings raise two obvious questions. First, why are some patterns of drinking neurobiologically healthy, while others are toxic? And second, how can we better identify drinking behaviors that promote the healthiest trajectories of cognitive aging?</p>
<p><strong>Neuroprotective in moderation, neurotoxic in excess</strong></p>
<p>In excess, alcohol works as a neurotoxin on many levels. Studies in animals have shown that binging on ethanol <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11981132" target="_blank">kills neurons</a> and <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12437579" target="_blank">impairs neurogenesis</a>–the birth of new neurons–in the hippocampus, a region critical to creating new memories. Furthermore, <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3580328/" target="_blank">alcohol-induced dementia</a> results from brain damage that occurs with prolonged alcohol abuse. The reasons for the observed <em>benefits</em> of alcohol are less clear. In contrast to binge drinking, moderate alcohol intake <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16202182" target="_blank">increases neurogenesis</a> and may help <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14600503" target="_blank">counteract oxidative stress</a> in neurons. It’s well documented that what’s good for the heart is good for the brain, and indeed, vascular dysfunction often co-exists with or precipitates many forms of dementia.<img alt="Wine Resveratrol" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-17974" height="300" src="http://blogs.plos.org/neuro/files/2016/01/Wine-Resveratrol-255x300.jpg" width="255" /> A prevailing theory is that the neuroprotective properties of drinking stem largely from their positive effects on cerebrovascular health. Alcohol can reduce risk for <a href="http://pmj.bmj.com/content/77/914/747.full" target="_blank">stroke and heart disease, lower blood pressure and increase HDL (“good”) cholesterol</a>. However, some evidence that wine is more strongly neuroprotective than other forms of alcohol suggests that resveratrol, a potent antioxidant found in red wine, may also play a role. Although resveratrol <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2857553/" target="_blank">minimizes dementia pathology</a> in animals, the extremely high doses required make it unlikely to be the primary source of neuroprotection from alcohol.</p>
<p><strong>Unraveling healthy drinking patterns for the aging brain </strong></p>
<p>For our aging population to reap the greatest benefit from alcohol, it will be essential to determine patterns of healthy drinking that are optimized for the individual. This will require, foremost, a comprehensive understanding of how alcohol distinctly affects you versus me based on our genetics, sex or lifestyle. For example, alcohol has been found to differentially influence <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15447910" target="_blank">brain structure</a> and risk for <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC516103/" target="_blank">dementia</a> or <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22396249" target="_blank">cognitive impairment</a> for those with and without the apolipoprotein E4 gene, a strong risk factor for Alzheimer’s disease. Furthermore, studies have inconsistently reported <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4271023/" target="_blank">sex differences</a> in how drinking influences cognitive decline, which may be explained by differences in how men and women metabolize alcohol.</p>
<p>Despite overwhelming evidence that moderate alcohol intake can be healthy for the aging brain, there are striking incongruences across findings–which may be due to differences in study design or confounding factors­–that muddle our understanding of alcohol’s benefits. ‘Survival bias,’ in which healthier individuals participate in studies for longer, is an unavoidable complication in longitudinal studies of aging. This could significantly skew results if unhealthy drinkers drop out early, leaving only “healthy” drinkers to be studied in very old age. Furthermore, most human studies on alcohol and brain aging rely on observed associations, which can be replete with confounding factors. For instance, it’s known that drinkers tend to live more healthy lifestyles (e.g., they may exercise more or follow a Mediterranean diet), or may drink more often simply because they’re more socially active, which alone is known <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19173101" target="_blank">to be brain-healthy</a>. What’s more, effects of alcohol on cognitive aging may depend on the <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12427876" target="_blank">type of alcohol</a> consumed, how alcohol intake is measured, or the definition of “non-drinkers.” Many studies group life-long abstainers together with quitters, who may avoid alcohol due to poor health or may have developed health problems from alcohol abuse. However, my postdoctoral adviser Linda McEvoy, who studies effects of alcohol on brain aging at UC San Diego, explains that “Randomized controlled trials offer a better alternative to more definitely answer the question of how moderate alcohol intake affects cognitive function. Such trials have demonstrated beneficial cardiometabolic effects in those randomized to drink moderate amounts of alcohol.”</p>
<p><strong>A prescription for alcohol?</strong></p>
<p>Despite some uncertainties in the research so far, it appears that regular moderate drinking is unlikely to be hazardous to cognitive function and may even support healthy brain aging. Until we have further clarification, McEvoy offers some advice to those hoping to preserve brain health into late life: “If a person consumes alcohol, I would advise drinking moderate amounts of alcohol (one or two drinks) with dinner. If the person does not drink, I would not advise starting. Some individuals have a hard time controlling the amount they drink, and heavy drinking has detrimental effects on brain health and cognitive function.”</p>

<p>When a parent asks their child plenty of “who?”, “what?”, “when?”, “where?”, “why?” questions, encourages them to go into detail and includes open-ended questions, psychologists call this an elaborative style. Past research has shown that children with parents like this tend to remember more experiences from their lives (the opposite parental style is to ask fewer questions in general, and to ask questions that only need a short, basic response). More specific studies have found that parents’ elaborative chat can also help their children remember museum visits.</p>
<p>A <a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022096516302296">new study</a> in the <em>Journal of Experimental Child Psychology</em> is the first to apply this line of research to young children’s memories of a recent science lesson. The findings provide tentative evidence that conversing with a child in an elaborative way could help them remember more about their lesson.</p>
<p><span id="more-19637"></span></p>
<p>Michelle Leichtman and her colleagues at the University of New Hampshire, USA, recruited the mothers or fathers of 40 children aged four to six from two schools, one in an upper middle-class area, the other lower middle-class. A scientist visited the children’s schools and gave an engaging, scripted lesson with props about the science of light. That evening, the researchers asked the parents to chat with their child about the lesson in whatever way they found natural, and to record the chat. Six days later, the researchers interviewed each child about the science lesson.</p>
<p>There was an indirect link between parents’ use of an elaborative conversational style and how much their child remembered of the science lesson six days later. That is, the more elaborative the parents’ questioning, the more details the children tended to recall the evening of the lesson. In turn, children who provided more detail when chatting to their parents also tended to remember more of the lesson (including new details they hadn’t mentioned previously) when chatting to a researcher about the lesson six days later. This was true for children from both schools and regardless of the parents’ own educational background.</p>
<p>There was only one direct link between parents’ conversational style and children’s later recall in the researcher interview, and that was the amount of descriptive words that the parents used (such as “Was the flashlight <em>blue</em>?”).</p>
<p>This research is very preliminary and needs replication. It’s correlational nature means we can’t know if parents are influencing children or if children are influencing parents. It might be both, and certainly, given the wider related research literature, it’s plausible that parents’ conversational style is having an influence. Leichtman and her colleagues highlighted several possible ways parents’ elaborative conversational style might have a benefit, including not only through encouraging greater recall, discussion and ways to connect ideas, but also at a motivational level, “impart[ing] to children a sense that the topic and details are worthy of their attention.”</p>

<p>Taking selfies makes us feel self-conscious and sends tremors through our self-esteem, according to <a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0191886917300715">new research</a> published in the <em>Journal of Personality and Individual Differences</em>. One group of undergraduates at Yonsei University in Seoul used their phone’s camera to take a selfie, while a control group photographed a cup on a desk. Afterwards selfie takers showed signs of increased social sensitivity, at least according to a test that involved detecting the direction of arrows on a computer screen. The arrows appeared in locations previously occupied by the features of a face and the idea was that participants would be more focused on these facial features, and thus quicker to detect the arrows, if they were in a socially vigilant state.</p>
<p>The fact that selfie takers showed enhanced social sensitivity (they were quicker to detect the arrows) is consistent with the way that our social sensitivity goes up when we are in front of a mirror or when someone else points a video camera at us, making us acutely aware of the imperfections we have on show.</p>
<p>The researchers, graduate students at the university, used this indirect measure to assess social sensitivity because they thought people might not respond honestly if they were simply asked how they were feeling.</p>
<p>In a similar vein, the researchers used an indirect measure to test if taking a selfie affected participants’ self-esteem, specifically whether it shrunk their written signature compared to its size at the start of the study (<a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2016/11/23/a-bigger-signature-correlates-with-social-bravado-and-narcissism/">past research has linked bigger signatures with greater self-esteem</a>). It did, but only for selfies <i>not</i> posted to social media, but simply saved to the phone. The authors speculated that the act of taking a selfie hurts self-esteem by bringing feelings about personal imperfections to the fore, but this wound can be salved through the self-promotional aspect of sharing your image to the wider world. On this reading, selfie-taking is a self-esteem rollercoaster, one that might put you back more or less where you started.</p>

Stinkbugs can ruin wine if enough are accidentally processed alive with the grapes. Three or fewer stinkbugs per grape cluster don’t have a noticeable effect on red wine.

<p>Workplace bullying can corrode organisations and wreck individual lives. Research has revealed more and more about effects on victims and the motives of the perpetrators. But bullying is often a performance that demands an audience: you can’t ostracise someone from an empty room, or gossip about them to the wind. So it’s worth looking at the third ingredient in the bullying mix: the bystander. <a href="http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/00224545.2016.1152213">New research</a> in the <em>Journal of Social Psychology</em> takes on this task, looking at the factors that dispose a bystander against bullying victims, and what might encourage them to step in and help.</p>
<p><span id="more-19584"></span></p>
<p>Researchers from the Netherlands-based Open University recruited 161 working adults and presented each with a hypothetical workplace vignette, in which the victim was interrupted, belittled, excluded and gossiped about by a bullying colleague. In one condition, the victim was proactive, daring the bully to criticise them to their face or demanding they cease their behaviour. In another, the victim avoided the situation, by skipping out when the bully entered a room, or by taking sick leave to avoid work entirely.</p>
<p>The participants were cast as bystanders to these contrasting situations, and Roelie Mulder’s team predicted that they would have a more negative view of the avoidant victims. Stigma research shows that people are less sympathetic to the suffering of others when they perceive they haven’t taken opportunities to improve their situation. Consistent with this, participants said they would feel more anger towards an avoidant victim, and considered them to hold much more responsibility for their predicament. Proactive victims were additionally seen as more self-reliant. So it might appear that proactivity is a good move if you want to get bystanders on-side and willing to help you out.</p>
<p>Sadly, that’s not the case. Participants were also asked to report how likely they would be to step in and help the victim, and they showed no greater willingness to help proactive ones. There’s a grim logic behind this: the more responsible a victim was seen to be for being bullied, the less participants wanted to help. But bystanders were also less likely to help victims they saw as self-reliant, presumably because they felt less of a pressing need to do so. You either don’t need help, or you don’t deserve it, a classic catch-22.</p>
<p>Proactivity appears admirable from the outside: in past work, most people said they would prefer to stand up to hypothetical bullies, and victims looking back on events often wish they had done so. But the reality is that when we find ourselves in these situations, it isn’t so easy – avoidance is the more common strategy – and what’s more, proactivity isn’t always the wisest choice. If you lose your cool, you could be at risk of formal consequences. And even if you play it well, a confronted bully might just double down on their behaviour. A proactive victim might be the one most in need of help, but bystanders don’t see it that way. So if you’re coming out fighting, bear in mind that you may also need to explicitly ask for help from those who seem sympathetic, but haven’t realised the need to throw their hat into the ring.</p>

<img alt="" class="attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image" height="110" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2017/02/iStock_000012644846Medium-140x110.jpg" style="display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;" width="140" /><p>There are many debates about the best way to select people into medical school, but one of the questions I ponder is how do we judge the success of such selection processes? There are a few problems in doing this.</p>
<p>Firstly, there’s the ‘restriction of range’ problem. The people who don’t get into medical school are often lost to follow-up. We cannot easily set up an experiment to see how they might have got on in medical school, had they been admitted. This means the students we follow are only those who were successful in the selection process. So, simple correlations between selection measures and intra-medical school measures can usually only distinguish the successful from the very successful. The simplest correlations are between selection measures and assessment outcomes – many have done that, <a href="https://bmcmededuc.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12909-016-0779-x">including us</a>. It’s helpful but not the whole answer.</p>
<p>Another measure could relate to our social responsibilities – the extent to which our selection processes match the health needs of our societies in which we practise. For example, <a href="https://www.nzma.org.nz/journal/read-the-journal/all-issues/2010-2019/2012/vol-125-no-1361/article-crampton">Otago medical school</a> has adopted the ‘mirror on society’ principle where we aim for the demographic makeup of the medical school class to match the demographic makeup of our country.</p>
<p>These areas generally try to predict success, but a third area to research is to predict difficulty. This area was the focus of our article <a href="https://bmcmededuc.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12909-017-0879-2">published this week in <em>BMC Medical Education</em></a>. Even here though, there are challenges for researchers as, in general, medical students are motivated and capable – so they mostly achieve well in medical school. This means the outcome of interest in our research (students who have difficulty in the course) are relatively infrequent –this is a desirable educational outcome, but it is a hindrance in research design.</p>
<p>As part of a more <a href="http://bmcmededuc.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1472-6920-11-29">programmatic approach</a> to assessment at the University of Otago, we keep a fairly close eye on our students and like to have sensitive measures of difficulty – we’d rather find a few who might be struggling but turn out to be doing well, than to miss a few who later get into bother. Our system is more sensitive than specific.</p>
<blockquote><p>…we’d rather find a few who might be struggling but turn out to be doing well, than to miss a few who later get into bother.</p></blockquote>
<p>We’ve found that students who are new to the country and have had less time to acculturate are at greater risk of developing problems, as are those with lower academic grades at entry and those with lower scores on the component of an aptitude test that measures understanding people. Men ran into more problems than women but no ethnic group was at greater risk.</p>
<p>Much as it pains me to say it, men are at greater risk of running into difficulty during their course but we’re not about to use gender as a selection measure! Although we keep trying to deny it, whichever way we look at it, academic grades still seem to be a good measure of success and difficulty – I guess doctors need to be smart. However, they also need to understand the society in which they will practise and understand people – these are measures on which we should place a greater focus.</p>

<p>
 Methane biogenesis in methanogens is mediated by methyl-coenzyme M reductase, an enzyme that is also responsible for the utilization of methane through anaerobic methane oxidation. The enzyme uses an ancillary factor called coenzyme F430, a nickel-containing modified tetrapyrrole that promotes catalysis through a methyl radical/Ni(ii)-thiolate intermediate. However, it is unclear how coenzyme F430 is synthesized from the common primogenitor uroporphyrinogen iii, incorporating 11 steric centres into the macrocycle, although the pathway must involve chelation, amidation, macrocyclic ring reduction, lactamization and carbocyclic ring formation. Here we identify the proteins that catalyse the biosynthesis of coenzyme F430 from sirohydrochlorin, termed CfbA–CfbE, and demonstrate their activity. The research completes our understanding of how the repertoire of tetrapyrrole-based pigments are constructed, permitting the development of recombinant systems to use these metalloprosthetic groups more widely.

                <h4><a href="http://feeds.nature.com/~r/NatureBiologicalSciencesResearch/~3/9nXAWXGgJa0/nature21405">Targeting a CAR to the TRAC locus with CRISPR/Cas9 enhances tumour rejection</a></h4>

<p>Chimeric antigen receptors (CARs) are synthetic receptors that redirect and reprogram T cells to mediate tumour rejection. The most successful CARs used to date are those targeting CD19 (ref. 2), which offer the prospect of complete remission in patients with chemorefractory or relapsed B-cell malignancies. CARs are typically transduced into the T cells of a patient using γ-retroviral vectors or other randomly integrating vectors, which may result in clonal expansion, oncogenic transformation, variegated transgene expression and transcriptional silencing. Recent advances in genome editing enable efficient sequence-specific interventions in human cells, including targeted gene delivery to the CCR5 and AAVS1 loci. Here we show that directing a CD19-specific CAR to the T-cell receptor α constant (TRAC) locus not only results in uniform CAR expression in human peripheral blood T cells, but also enhances T-cell potency, with edited cells vastly outperforming conventionally generated CAR T cells in a mouse model of acute lymphoblastic leukaemia. We further demonstrate that targeting the CAR to the TRAC locus averts tonic CAR signalling and establishes effective internalization and re-expression of the CAR following single or repeated exposure to antigen, delaying effector T-cell differentiation and exhaustion. These findings uncover facets of CAR immunobiology and underscore the potential of CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing to advance immunotherapies.</p><p>Nature   <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/nature21405">doi: 10.1038/nature21405</a></p><img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/NatureBiologicalSciencesResearch/~4/9nXAWXGgJa0" width="1" />

<p>
 Nucleic acids undergo naturally occurring chemical modifications. Over 100 different modifications have been described and every position in the purine and pyrimidine bases can be modified; often the sugar is also modified. Despite recent progress, the mechanism for the biosynthesis of most modifications is not fully understood, owing, in part, to the difficulty associated with reconstituting enzyme activity in vitro. Whereas some modifications can be efficiently formed with purified components, others may require more intricate pathways. A model for modification interdependence, in which one modification is a prerequisite for another, potentially explains a major hindrance in reconstituting enzymatic activity in vitro. This model was prompted by the earlier discovery of tRNA cytosine-to-uridine editing in eukaryotes, a reaction that has not been recapitulated in vitro and the mechanism of which remains unknown. Here we show that cytosine 32 in the anticodon loop of Trypanosoma brucei tRNAThr is methylated to 3-methylcytosine (m3C) as a pre-requisite for C-to-U deamination. Formation of m3C in vitro requires the presence of both the T. brucei m3C methyltransferase TRM140 and the deaminase ADAT2/3. Once formed, m3C is deaminated to 3-methyluridine (m3U) by the same set of enzymes. ADAT2/3 is a highly mutagenic enzyme, but we also show that when co-expressed with the methyltransferase its mutagenicity is kept in check. This helps to explain how T. brucei escapes ‘wholesale deamination’ of its genome while harbouring both enzymes in the nucleus. This observation has implications for the control of another mutagenic deaminase, human AID, and provides a rationale for its regulation.

<p>
 Organelles display characteristic morphologies that are intimately tied to their cellular function, but how organelles are shaped is poorly understood. The endoplasmic reticulum is particularly intriguing, as it comprises morphologically distinct domains, including a dynamic network of interconnected membrane tubules. Several membrane proteins have been implicated in network formation, but how exactly they mediate network formation and whether they are all required are unclear. Here we reconstitute a dynamic tubular membrane network with purified endoplasmic reticulum proteins. Proteoliposomes containing the membrane-fusing GTPase Sey1p (refs 6, 7) and the curvature-stabilizing protein Yop1p (refs 8, 9) from Saccharomyces cerevisiae form a tubular network upon addition of GTP. The tubules rapidly fragment when GTP hydrolysis of Sey1p is inhibited, indicating that network maintenance requires continuous membrane fusion and that Yop1p favours the generation of highly curved membrane structures. Sey1p also forms networks with other curvature-stabilizing proteins, including reticulon and receptor expression-enhancing proteins (REEPs) from different species. Atlastin, the vertebrate orthologue of Sey1p, forms a GTP-hydrolysis-dependent network on its own, serving as both a fusion and curvature-stabilizing protein. Our results show that organelle shape can be generated by a surprisingly small set of proteins and represents an energy-dependent steady state between formation and disassembly.

<p>
 The prefrontal cortex is a critical neuroanatomical hub for controlling motivated behaviours across mammalian species. In addition to intra-cortical connectivity, prefrontal projection neurons innervate subcortical structures that contribute to reward-seeking behaviours, such as the ventral striatum and midline thalamus. While connectivity among these structures contributes to appetitive behaviours, how projection-specific prefrontal neurons encode reward-relevant information to guide reward seeking is unknown. Here we use in vivo two-photon calcium imaging to monitor the activity of dorsomedial prefrontal neurons in mice during an appetitive Pavlovian conditioning task. At the population level, these neurons display diverse activity patterns during the presentation of reward-predictive cues. However, recordings from prefrontal neurons with resolved projection targets reveal that individual corticostriatal neurons show response tuning to reward-predictive cues, such that excitatory cue responses are amplified across learning. By contrast, corticothalamic neurons gradually develop new, primarily inhibitory responses to reward-predictive cues across learning. Furthermore, bidirectional optogenetic manipulation of these neurons reveals that stimulation of corticostriatal neurons promotes conditioned reward-seeking behaviour after learning, while activity in corticothalamic neurons suppresses both the acquisition and expression of conditioned reward seeking. These data show how prefrontal circuitry can dynamically control reward-seeking behaviour through the opposing activities of projection-specific cell populations.

                <h4><a href="http://feeds.nature.com/~r/NatureBiologicalSciencesResearch/~3/h9ClTlj5Zog/nature21373">Intragenic DNA methylation prevents spurious transcription initiation</a></h4>

<p>
 In mammals, DNA methylation occurs mainly at CpG dinucleotides. Methylation of the promoter suppresses gene expression, but the functional role of gene-body DNA methylation in highly expressed genes has yet to be clarified. Here we show that, in mouse embryonic stem cells, Dnmt3b-dependent intragenic DNA methylation protects the gene body from spurious RNA polymerase II entry and cryptic transcription initiation. Using different genome-wide approaches, we demonstrate that this Dnmt3b function is dependent on its enzymatic activity and recruitment to the gene body by H3K36me3. Furthermore, the spurious transcripts can either be degraded by the RNA exosome complex or capped, polyadenylated, and delivered to the ribosome to produce aberrant proteins. Elongating RNA polymerase II therefore triggers an epigenetic crosstalk mechanism that involves SetD2, H3K36me3, Dnmt3b and DNA methylation to ensure the fidelity of gene transcription initiation, with implications for intragenic hypomethylation in cancer.

                <h4><a href="http://feeds.nature.com/~r/NatureBiologicalSciencesResearch/~3/a1lENTpzn14/nature21368">Complement drives glucosylceramide accumulation and tissue inflammation in Gaucher disease</a></h4>

<p>
 Gaucher disease is caused by mutations in GBA1, which encodes the lysosomal enzyme glucocerebrosidase (GCase). GBA1 mutations drive extensive accumulation of glucosylceramide (GC) in multiple innate and adaptive immune cells in the spleen, liver, lung and bone marrow, often leading to chronic inflammation. The mechanisms that connect excess GC to tissue inflammation remain unknown. Here we show that activation of complement C5a and C5a receptor 1 (C5aR1) controls GC accumulation and the inflammatory response in experimental and clinical Gaucher disease. Marked local and systemic complement activation occurred in GCase-deficient mice or after pharmacological inhibition of GCase and was associated with GC storage, tissue inflammation and proinflammatory cytokine production. Whereas all GCase-inhibited mice died within 4–5 weeks, mice deficient in both GCase and C5aR1, and wild-type mice in which GCase and C5aR were pharmacologically inhibited, were protected from these adverse effects and consequently survived. In mice and humans, GCase deficiency was associated with strong formation of complement-activating GC-specific IgG autoantibodies, leading to complement activation and C5a generation. Subsequent C5aR1 activation controlled UDP-glucose ceramide glucosyltransferase production, thereby tipping the balance between GC formation and degradation. Thus, extensive GC storage induces complement-activating IgG autoantibodies that drive a pathway of C5a generation and C5aR1 activation that fuels a cycle of cellular GC accumulation, innate and adaptive immune cell recruitment and activation in Gaucher disease. As enzyme replacement and substrate reduction therapies are expensive and still associated with inflammation, increased risk of cancer and Parkinson disease, targeting C5aR1 may serve as a treatment option for patients with Gaucher disease and, possibly, other lysosomal storage diseases.

<p>I always have quite a bit on my pending list to read - academic papers, blogs, planets, and the sort. Usually, when I go through the planets, such as the <a class="reference external" href="http://fedoraplanet.org/">Fedora</a>, <a class="reference external" href="http://planet.gnome.org/">GNOME</a> or the two neuroscience planets I use - <a class="reference external" href="https://sanjayankur31.github.io/planet-neuroscience/">neuroscience</a>, <a class="reference external" href="https://sanjayankur31.github.io/planet-neuroscientists/">neuroscientists</a>, I don't have the time to read all the articles right then. I used to either bookmark links, or note them down somewhere to read later. One day, though, I ran into <a class="reference external" href="http://ankursinha.in/blog/feeds/tags/getpocket.com/">Pocket</a>, which lets you save the article to read later and makes it available to you on multiple devices. It's extremely convenient.</p>
<p>Of course, the one issue with <a class="reference external" href="http://ankursinha.in/blog/feeds/tags/getpocket.com/">Pocket</a> is that it isn't <a class="reference external" href="https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.en.html">Free software</a>. So, like I do, I went looking for an alternative. After a few hours, I ran into <a class="reference external" href="https://wallabag.org/en">Wallabag</a> on <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/wallabag/wallabag">Github</a>. It's written in PHP, and is licensed under the <a class="reference external" href="https://tldrlegal.com/license/mit-license">MIT license</a>. It's quite easy to deploy, and there's a <a class="reference external" href="https://gitter.im/wallabag/wallabag">Gitter channel</a> where you can get some help too.</p>
<p>You either enter the URL in the Wallabag page manually, or you can use the <a class="reference external" href="https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/wallabagger/">Firefox</a>/<a class="reference external" href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/wallabagger/gbmgphmejlcoihgedabhgjdkcahacjlj">Chrome</a>/<a class="reference external" href="https://addons.opera.com/en/extensions/details/wallabagger/?display=en">Opera</a> addon - it let's you right click a page or a link and "Wallabag.it!". There's also a bookmarklet, which you can use with <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/5digits/dactyl">Pentadactyl</a>, for example:</p>
<pre class="code bash literal-block"><span class="c1"># Add to ~/.pentadactylrc
</span>command! wallabagit -description <span class="s2">"Add to wallabag"</span> open javascript:<span class="o">(</span><span class="k">function</span><span class="o">(){</span>var%20url<span class="o">=</span>location.href<span class="o">||</span>url<span class="p">;</span>var%20wllbg<span class="o">=</span>window.open<span class="o">(</span><span class="s1">'https://app.wallabag.it/bookmarklet?url='</span>%20+%20encodeURI<span class="o">(</span>url<span class="o">)</span>,<span class="s1">'_blank'</span><span class="o">)</span><span class="p">;</span><span class="o">})()</span><span class="p">;</span>
</pre>
<p>Wallabag fetches the text of the page and stores it for you so that you can read it later. You can even organise your saved pages with tags and the sort.</p>
<a class="reference external image-reference" href="http://ankursinha.in/blog/images/20170220-wallabag.png"><img alt="Screenshot showing the Wallabag main page" class="img-responsive align-center" src="http://ankursinha.in/blog/images/20170220-wallabag.png" /></a>
<p>Here's a page that I'm trying to read later, for example:</p>
<a class="reference external image-reference" href="http://ankursinha.in/blog/images/20170220-wallabag-2.png"><img alt="Screenshot showing an article in Wallabag" class="img-responsive align-center" src="http://ankursinha.in/blog/images/20170220-wallabag-2.png" /></a>
<p>I played with a deployment, but decided not to deploy and maintain an instance myself. Instead, I signed up for the instance Wallabag have here - <a class="reference external" href="https://www.wallabag.it/en">Wallabag.it</a>. It's quite cheap - they have an offer going too at the moment - <a class="reference external" href="https://wallabag.org/en/news/wallabagit">only 9€ for an entire year</a>!</p>
<p>Wallabag uses a the <a class="reference external" href="http://fivefilters.org/content-only/">FiveFilters Full Text RSS tool</a> to extract the text and other data from web pages. Some websites require special instructions to tell the tool what information needs to be extracted - this tends to happen with a few academic websites. There's a <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/fivefilters/ftr-site-config">repository of such config files here</a>. So, if you do run into a website that isn't rendering properly, you can <a class="reference external" href="http://doc.wallabag.org/en/master/user/errors_during_fetching.html">troubleshoot the issue and submit a config file too</a>.</p>
<p>Whether you decide to deploy an instance yourself, or use <a class="reference external" href="https://www.wallabag.it/en">Wallabag.it</a>, I think it's a really useful tool to have. Of course, don't forget to install the <a class="reference external" href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=fr.gaulupeau.apps.InThePoche&amp;hl=en">app on your phone</a> too!</p>
<p>Happy reading!</p>

<p>Back in the 1970s, eight mentally well people, including psychologist <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Rosenhan">David Rosenhan</a>, presented themselves at psychiatric hospitals, where they showed signs of mild anxiety and complained of auditory hallucinations, specifically words like “empty” and “hollow”. All were admitted and either diagnosed with schizophrenia or, in one case, manic depression, and, despite acting “normal” after arrival, they were kept in hospital for an average of 19 days. On discharge all were described as having schizophrenia (or depression) “in remission”.</p>
<p>This was Rosenhan’s classic study “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rosenhan_experiment">On Being Sane in Insane Places</a>” which he claimed showed the stigmatising power of psychiatric labels and the inability of psychiatric staff to distinguish normality from supposed abnormality, as have many others since.</p>
<p>But from a methodological perspective, the study was problematic for a number of reasons and Rosenhan’s interpretation has been hotly disputed. In their <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/50_Great_Myths_of_Popular_Psychology">highly regarded book on psychology myths</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scott_Lilienfeld">Scott Lilienfeld</a> and his co-authors discuss the problem with Rosenhan’s study at length, such as the fact that in the 70s “in remission” was a very rare discharge diagnosis that actually showed psychiatric staff had realised the “pseudo patients” were mentally well.</p>
<p>Ultimately, Lilienfeld et al argue that it is a myth that “psychiatric labels cause harm by stigmatising people” and that the overly gullible interpretation of the Rosenhan study has helped propagate this myth. Others may disagree, but it’s at least fair to say that Rosenhan’s study had serious issues and that not all psychologists agree that psychiatric labels are in themselves harmful (consider too <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2014/09/02/on-being-labelled-schizophrenic-in-the-words-of-the-diagnosed/">research</a> that’s found that while clients say psychiatric labels can be difficult to deal with, they can also be beneficial in some ways, in terms of helping them understand their experiences and helping them to access appropriate treatments).</p>
<p>So, how is this classic study covered in textbooks relating to clinical psychology and mental health (the sub-discipline usually referred to on university courses as “abnormal psychology”)? In a <a href="http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/0098628317692634">new survey</a> of 12 contemporary abnormal psych textbooks in the journal <em>Teaching of Psychology</em>, Jared Bartels and Daniel Peters found that half of them still give space to Rosenhan’s flawed study, but only two include any criticism or alternative interpretation of it at all.</p>
<p>This is a small survey and we’re not told the titles of the books, but the findings suggest that the problem of uncritical textbook coverage of <a href="https://thepsychologist.bps.org.uk/volume-21/edition-9/foundations-sand">social psychology’s classic, myth-like studies</a>, such as the <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2014/07/23/what-the-textbooks-dont-tell-you-one-of-psychologys-most-famous-experiments-was-seriously-flawed/">Stanford Prison Experiment</a> and <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2015/10/13/social-psychology-textbooks-ignore-all-modern-criticisms-of-milgrams-obedience-experiments/">Milgram’s “obedience research”</a>, may also extend to the realm of classic mental health-related research. Is it that textbook authors are unaware of the criticisms of the Rosenhan study? Possibly, although Bartels and Peters surmise that perhaps authors know of the issues and alternative interpretations, but that these “shortcomings … are considered less important than the edifying message of the stigmatising effect of labels”.</p>

                <h4><a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/neuroskeptic/?p=8562">The Science of the Rorschach Blots</a></h4>

When the psychiatrist Hermann Rorschach blotted ink onto paper to produce a series of abstract patterns, could he have known that nearly 100 years later, the Rorschach test would be a household name?



Although the use of the Rorschach to diagnose mental illness is mostly a thing of the past, research on the test continues. Last week, two new papers were published on the Rorschach blots, including a fractal analysis of the images themselves and a brain scanning study using fMRI.

<p>Ankur Sinha's journal club session where he discusses the pre-print paper, "<a class="reference external" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1609.05730">Multi-contact synapses for stable networks: a spike-timing dependent model of dendritic spine plasticity and turnover (Deger, M., Seeholzer, A., Gerstner, W. (2016))</a>"</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>Excitatory synaptic connections in the adult neocortex consist of multiple synaptic contacts, almost exclusively formed on dendritic spines. Changes of dendritic spine shape and volume, a correlate of synaptic strength, can be tracked in vivo for weeks. Here, we present a combined model of spike-timing dependent dendritic spine plasticity and turnover that explains the steady state multi-contact configuration of synapses in adult neocortical networks. In this model, many presynaptic neurons compete to make strong synaptic connections onto postsynaptic neurons, while the synaptic contacts comprising each connection cooperate via postsynaptic firing. We demonstrate that the model is consistent with experimentally observed long-term dendritic spine dynamics under steady-state and lesion induced conditions, and show that cooperation of multiple synaptic contacts is crucial for stable, long-term synaptic memories. In simulations of a simplified network of barrel cortex, our plasticity rule reproduces whisker-trimming induced rewiring of thalamo-cortical and recurrent synaptic connectivity on realistic time scales.</p>

<img alt="Pixabay" class="attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image" height="110" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2017/02/skin-222664_1920-140x110.jpg" style="display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;" width="140" /><p>As we age, our cells reduce their ability to regenerate as effectively, pigmentation increases, and wrinkles emerge. All of us experience some form of detriment to the skin, which cosmetic companies seek to re-mediate. For less of us, aging on the skin poses more serious issues such as cancer.</p>
<p>Our metabolism is key to supporting the function of the skin, such as the regulation of collagen and water. However, very little is currently known about metabolic alterations in aged skin.</p>
<p>Assessing metabolic changes at the genomic level can lead to new solutions to prevent age induced skin disorders. In the scientific community, it is well established that gene expression adaptions and metabolic changes accompany skin degradation. It has been observed that DNA repair capacities reduce, and methylation changes lead to decreased cellular plasticity.</p>
<p><a href="http://bmcgenomics.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12864-017-3547-3">Recently published research</a> from ETH Zurich provides valuable information on the metabolic adaptions of aging skin, and may benefit cosmetic companies to devise new solutions for age induced skin deterioration. These adaptions were observed in young (20-25 year old) and old (55-66 years old) human females by analyzing the RNA and metabolites of their skin’s epidermis.</p>
<p>A key discovery in the aged skin was the reduction of Q10; a coenzyme present within most animals. Often found within eukaryotic cells, Q10 is protein soluble, and can be seen in the market place as a health supplement for regulating energy in the body. Observed alterations to the processing of glucose (glycolysis), the reduced biosynthesis of protein and the organic compound polyamine are also discussed.</p>
<p>While Q10 decreased, there was a rise in the levels of taurine, the bio-marker cresol, and α-CEHC – the vitamin E metabolite. Metabolites for Vitamin E play an important role by providing anti-oxidative functions and preventing oxidative damage induced by UV energy. Most amino acid metabolites accumulated with age, helping to counteract dry skin by promoting moisturization of the epidermis, as the authors discuss.</p>
<p>Applying metabolome and transcriptome analyses to human epidermal samples has provided insight into the metabolic adaptions associated with skin aging. Various metabolites are observed to have remedial effects on aging skin, which may help improve anti-aging skin products in the future.</p>
