<p>A tough interview or critical match can generate such anxiety that it ends up sabotaging our hopes and fulfilling our fears. People adopt different ploys to drive it away, from meditating to enjoying a cigarette. But it’s another tactic at the centre of <a href="http://www.hbs.edu/faculty/Pages/item.aspx?num=51401">new research</a> published in <em>Organizational Behavior and Human Decision Processes</em>: the power of ritual. Many top-level performers use ritual to prepare for their game or show, whether this be chewing on <a href="http://www.mensjournal.com/expert-advice/10-habits-of-highly-successful-athletes-20131203/brian-urlacher">exactly two cookies</a> or <a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/music/features/leonard-cohen-before-the-gig-a-chant-in-latin-8104872.html">chanting Latin</a> – and the new research suggests many of the rest of us do too, with around half of a surveyed sample of participants admitting to trying it at least once. But is there a point to it?</p>
<p>The research, led by Harvard Business School’s Alison Woods Brooks, suggests there is. In a pair of studies, 250 participants had to cope with the pressure of having to sing part of a song to a stranger, the Journey “classic” <em>Don’t Stop Believing</em>. Just before they put their voice on show, participants in one condition were asked to conduct a short ritual: draw a picture of their feelings, sprinkle salt on it, recite a countdown aloud before throwing the paper in the trash.</p>
<p><span id="more-17783"></span></p>
<p>Using a pulse tracker to measure the participants’ heart rate, the researchers found that assigning them the singing task set their hearts racing. But they also found that practicing the ritual, compared to doing nothing, dropped participants’ heart rate down towards normal levels. Self-reported anxiety was also reduced, and ritual users produced singing of a higher quality in terms of pitch, volume and note duration. They didn’t just feel better; they performed better, too.</p>
<p>The next study asked whether ritual is effective in any challenging situation, or specifically in anxiety-provoking contexts. Participants all attempted the same set of maths problems, but the researchers told some of them they were “fun maths puzzles”, while telling others it was “a very difficult IQ test”; only the second group showed improved performance after completing a ritual beforehand, suggesting that anxiety alleviation is key.</p>
<p>How do rituals calm us down? Maybe it’s the chance to express oneself emotionally, known to be an effective method of reducing anxiety. But the definition of ritual used by Brooks – fixed routines with symbolic significance – doesn’t require any self-expression. And a neutral procedure – writing down a fixed sequence of numbers – turned out to work just as well in improving performance. However, when participants were told this procedure was just “a few random behaviours” it was less effective than when it was explicitly labelled as a ritual, confirming that the symbolic significance is an important component of the effect.</p>
<p>Small studies on “pre-performance routines” have been published in the past but their focus included more obviously functional practices, such as stretches and concentration exercises. This new work shows the specific benefits owing to ritual: the millennia-old cultural practice used to cope with the hunt, birth, and death. More modern anxiety management techniques such as expressive writing or CBT’s emotional appraisal are familiar parts of the psychologist’s toolkit, and may appear as overdue replacements for the methods of the past. But as Brooks and her colleagues conclude, “although some may dismiss rituals as irrational, those who enact rituals may well outperform the skeptics who forgo them.”</p>

<p>When all around us feels like chaos, it’s human instinct to cling to the rocks of dogma, and woe betide anyone who tries to loosen our grip. Previous studies, usually involving strong religious believers, have shown how dogmatic beliefs allay the anxiety brought on by feelings of uncertainty. In turn, any groups with opposing views are treated with suspicion and prejudice. A <a href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/bjop.12186/abstract?campaign=woletoc">new study</a> in the <em>British Journal of Psychology</em> broadens this out, showing these processes aren’t unique to religious believers. Dogmatic atheists too seem to be motivated by the need to cope with uncertainty, and they too are prejudiced towards threatening groups, especially during times of uncertainty. The researchers at Jagiellonian University, led by Małgorzata Kossowska, suggest their findings have interesting implications for understanding political orientations and prejudices. The world feels especially unpredictable right now. Are we all, whatever our politics, clinging to our rocks more strongly than ever?</p>
<p><span id="more-17682"></span></p>
<p>Kossowska and her colleagues tested levels of dogmatic belief, whether religious or atheist, and intolerance of uncertainty, among 201 participants. They found that an inability to cope with uncertainty (as measured with the <a href="http://nymag.com/scienceofus/2015/12/this-quiz-shows-how-well-you-handle-uncertainty.html">Need for Closure scale</a>) correlated with dogmatic belief among religious people – Christians in this cultural context – but also with dogmatic belief among atheists. The researchers said this pattern suggests that, whatever your own religious or non-religious orientation, “dogmatic beliefs offer a global worldview full or rules and explanations and thereby reduce the complexity of life and create a psychologically safe and predictable environment.”</p>
<p>Next, the researchers tested the religious and atheistic beliefs and intolerance of 116 more participants, but this time they also manipulated some of them to experience feelings of uncertainty (participants rated their agreement with statements about times they’d felt uncertain, under the guise of it being a personality test). The researchers also tested their prejudice towards different social groups.</p>
<p>As before, a dislike of uncertainty correlated with dogmatic beliefs, both religious and atheist. More dogma also correlated with greater prejudice towards out-groups and seeing them as more threatening. Moreover, dogmatic believers of both stripes showed increased prejudice when primed to experience feelings of uncertainty. For the orthodox Christian believers, this manifested in increased prejudice towards homosexual people; for the dogmatic atheists, it was increased prejudice towards pro-life supporters.</p>
<p>The defence mechanism of dogmatic belief has in the past been seen as a feature of the religious and politically conservative. Kossowska and her team argue their findings suggest that uncertainty-fuelled dogma, and prejudice towards those who threaten that dogma, is a more universal phenomenon. “Prejudice is not limited only to religious believers or to those on the political right, but rather, as a response to uncertainty it may also occur among dogmatic atheists and the otherwise politically and socially liberal,” the researchers said.</p>

            <p>I present a novel (well, in 2009 it was) modular, stochastic model for biological template-based linear chain elongation processes. In this model, elongation complexes (eg DNA polymerase, RNA polymerase, or ribosomes associated with nascent chains) that span a finite number of template units step along the template, one after another, with semaphore constructs preventing overtaking. The central elongation module is readily extended with modules that represent initiation and termination processes. The model was used to explore the effect of elongation complex span on motor velocity and dispersion, and the effect of initiation activator and repressor binding kinetics on the overall elongation dynamics. The results demonstrate that (1) motors that move smoothly are able to travel at a greater velocity and closer together than motors that move more erratically, and (2) the rate at which completed chains are released is proportional to the occupancy or vacancy of activator or repressor binding sites only when initiation or activator/repressor dissociation is slow in comparison with elongation. If you think the above is a load of old hokum, do come to the talk for some more!</p>

<p>It’s a common belief that to make optimal decisions we need to be more logical and less emotional, rather like Mr Spock in Star Trek. In fact, much evidence argues against this. Consider the behaviour of patients whose brain damage has made them unusually cold and logical. Rather than this helping them make decisions, they often seem paralysed by indecision.</p>
<p>These patients, who usually have damage to parts of their frontal cortex, also tend to perform poorly on a game that’s used by psychologists to measure risk-taking behaviour: the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iowa_gambling_task">Iowa Gambling Task</a>. The neurologist and author Antonio Damasio thinks this is because they have lost the ability to incorporate gut instincts – literally, their visceral reactions – into their decision-making, an idea that forms the basis of his <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Somatic_marker_hypothesis">Somatic Marker Hypothesis</a>. This hypothesis has been very influential but the evidence supporting it, now gathered over several decades, is nearly all based on research using the Iowa Gambling Task.</p>
<p>In a <a href="http://psycnet.apa.org/journals/dec/4/1/52/">recent paper</a> in <em>Decision</em>, two British psychologists tested the Somatic Marker Hypothesis in a new context, the Balloon Analogue Risk Task, which involves deciding how far to pump a balloon. They found little evidence to support the central tenet of the Somatic Marker Hypothesis, the idea that our physiological reactions shape our decisions.</p>
<p><span id="more-17215"></span></p>
<p>Rebecca Wright at the University of Essex and Tim Rakow at King’s College London conducted three separate studies involving dozens of participants who completed different versions of the Balloon Analogue Risk Task. The basic version involved participants deciding how far to keep pumping a balloon depicted on-screen. The more participants pumped the balloon, the more points they acquired, which if banked could be traded for cash later. But if they pumped too far before banking their points, the balloon would burst, and the points would be lost. As participants played the task, the researchers measured the amount of perspiration on two of their fingers, which is a well-established physiological marker of emotional arousal.</p>
<p>Wright and Rakow wanted to see if they could find evidence of participants’ physiological reactions shaping their decision-making, comparable to what Damasio and others have found with the Iowa Gambling Task.</p>
<p>In the gambling task, there are four piles of cards, each made up of cards with a different mix of monetary values. Participants have to choose which piles to take cards from in order to end up with as much cash value as possible. The main evidence in support of the Somatic Marker Hypothesis is that when neurologically healthy people perform the task, they often show a physiological reaction (sweatiness of the skin) prior to considering picking cards from a bad pile, even before they realise at a conscious level that the pile is not an optimal one to pick from, thus guiding them towards more optimal choices.</p>
<p>During the balloon task, Wright and Rakow found some limited evidence to support the Somatic Marker Hypothesis. Bad outcomes – that is, when the balloon popped and points were lost – were associated with an increased sweat response. This can be seen as a “somatic mark” or visceral response associated with the experience of a bad outcome. Crucially, however, the researchers found no support for the more contentious idea that physiological responses were shaping participants’ decisions. The participants’ current sweat response was not associated with their upcoming decision about whether to keep pumping the balloon or bank their points.</p>
<p>“We find little support for skin conductance guiding decision-making – a core prediction of the Somatic Marker Hypothesis,” the researchers concluded. Now this is just one set of studies, so it would be rash to conclude from the new findings that the Somatic Marker Hypothesis has no merit. Also, there is a wider evidence-base, not tied directly to Somatic Marker Hypothesis, that supports the broader idea that bodily sensations can influence our decision-making: for instance, <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2012/10/11/people-make-more-moral-decisions-when-they-think-their-heart-is-racing/">a faster heart rate has been linked with making more moral decisions</a>. However, this study highlights the surprising fact that an influential theory in psychology is based on evidence collected in a very narrow context. And when tested in a new way, it has mostly failed.</p>

<p>“There is but one truly serious philosophical problem and that is suicide” the French author and philosopher Albert Camus stated. But it is not only philosophers who are moved by this issue. Psychologists are seeking ways of preventing this tragic death, and health care organisations are sounding the alarm. Around a million people die at their own hand every year, which makes suicide the tenth most common cause of death. Additionally, for every completed suicide, there are 10 to 40 survived attempts, which means that in the USA alone 650,000 people each year are taken to emergency rooms following an attempt on their own life. Yet what is most disturbing is that the number of suicides is continually rising. The WHO reports that since the 1960s this number has grown over 60 per cent.</p>
<p>Is psychology capable of identifying the risk factors that can push people to take their own lives? Joseph Franklin at Florida State University and his research team at the Technology and Psychopathy (TAP) Lab have provided an answer, but it is a disappointing one. Our capacity to predict whether someone will make a suicide attempt is no better than chance. What is worse, we have not made any progress in this area in the last half-century. These striking conclusions come as the result of a meta-analysis of 365 studies into suicide risk conducted over the last 50 years and published recently in <em>Psychological Bulletin</em> (<a href="http://www.apa.org/pubs/journals/releases/bul-bul0000084.pdf">pdf</a>).</p>
<p><span id="more-17189"></span></p>
<p>Should these results be seen as discrediting psychology, leading us to declare its incompetence in that sphere and that the matter should be left in the hands of philosophers? I would not be so quick to make that argument, although I do consider the findings to discredit a certain manner of practicing psychology. As Franklin and his colleagues observed, the problem with past research is that the methods have been extremely narrow. Most studies only looked at a single risk factor, such as depression or low serotonin in the brain, and then followed patients over a decade, while in real life it is generally the interaction of many factors of a given impact level that provide the fuel powering some sort of dramatic reaction.</p>
<p>Moreover, most often suicide is not caused by the simple sum of those factors, but from a complex interaction between them, yet the research methods generally applied by psychologists are not capable of uncovering such dynamics. Research on complex systems, which is most certainly an appropriate designation for the mind, long ago demonstrated that their characteristics are not always discernible when looking at constituent elements. Why, then, do the vast majority of psychologists so obstinately insist on treating people as simple machines that react linearly in response to simple stimuli?</p>
<p>I know of only one answer to this question. The single-factor approach is easier and generates the effects expected by scientists, such as grants for research, the conviction that they are engaged in important work, points for publications indispensable in making progress in one’s scientific career, participation in conference tourism, etc. Meanwhile, machines are increasingly overtaking researchers trapped in this mode of thinking. In the past two years, multiple groups have begun work developing “machine learning algorithms” to combine tens or even hundreds of risk factors together to predict suicidal behaviours. “The preliminary results are promising, with algorithms predicting suicidal behaviours with greater than 80 per cent accuracy, but this work is just in its initial phase,” said Franklin. “However, in the very near future, this work may produce accurate predictions of suicidal behaviours on a large scale.”</p>
<p>His team has already developed a free web app that has proven effective in trials at reducing suicidal behaviours. The app, called “<a href="http://tectectech.com">Tec-Tec</a>” uses a simple game to train users to see certain words and images in a different light (a form of “evaluative conditioning”) and is available on iTunes and Amazon right now. Studies have shown that the app reduced suicidal behaviours by about 50 per cent over the course of a month in hundreds of people, and they hope in the future to reach a reduction rate approaching 100 percent.</p>
<p>Does this mean that all the existing scales measuring the risk of suicidal behaviours should be thrown away, and the counsellors and therapists working on suicide prevention should think about getting a new job? In fact Franklin recommended therapists continue using the guidelines, but he added that there’s an urgent need to re-evaluate them.</p>
<p>Franklin’s cautious approach to the tools currently in use arises primarily from the fact that past studies have not looked at the impact of known risk factors over short time-spans (on average, they examined one risk factor over 10 years) where they may be more useful. Furthermore, previous studies examined only a portion of the measures from the far more expansive set that is used in clinical assessment.</p>
<p>Franklin also is likely aware that an experienced counsellor frequently relies on her or his own experience and clinical intuition together with more formal risk measures, and that these clinical judgments and measures together might be more effective than a mere coin-flip. Unfortunately, personal clinical intuition does not constitute a cohesive and reliable system of knowledge with significant predictive capacity: it can’t be taught or used by others. It would appear that to prevent more suicides in future, artificial intelligence could be a far better solution.</p>

 Cervical cancer remains one of the leading causes of cancer-related deaths worldwide. Here we report the extensive molecular characterization of 228 primary cervical cancers, the largest comprehensive genomic study of cervical cancer to date. We observed striking APOBEC mutagenesis patterns and identified SHKBP1, ERBB3, CASP8, HLA-A, and TGFBR2 as novel significantly mutated genes in cervical cancer. We also discovered novel amplifications in immune targets CD274/PD-L1 and PDCD1LG2/PD-L2, and the BCAR4 lncRNA that has been associated with response to lapatinib. HPV integration was observed in all HPV18-related cases and 76% of HPV16-related cases, and was associated with structural aberrations and increased target gene expression. We identified a unique set of endometrial-like cervical cancers, comprised predominantly of HPV-negative tumors with high frequencies of KRAS, ARID1A, and PTEN mutations. Integrative clustering of 178 samples identified Keratin-low Squamous, Keratin-high Squamous, and Adenocarcinoma-rich subgroups. These molecular analyses reveal new potential therapeutic targets for cervical cancers.

            <p>Mitochondria are double-membraned organelles with variable shapes influenced by metabolic conditions, developmental stage, and environmental stimuli. Their dynamic morphology is a result of regulated and balanced fusion and fission processes. Fusion is crucial for the health and physiological functions of mitochondria, including complementation of damaged mitochondrial DNAs and the maintenance of membrane potential. Mitofusins are dynamin-related GTPases that are essential for mitochondrial fusion. They are embedded in the mitochondrial outer membrane and thought to fuse adjacent mitochondria via combined oligomerization and GTP hydrolysis. However, the molecular mechanisms of this process remain unknown. Here we present crystal structures of engineered human MFN1 containing the GTPase domain and a helical domain during different stages of GTP hydrolysis. The helical domain is composed of elements from widely dispersed sequence regions of MFN1 and resembles the ‘neck’ of the bacterial dynamin-like protein. The structures reveal unique features of its catalytic machinery and explain how GTP binding induces conformational changes to promote GTPase domain dimerization in the transition state. Disruption of GTPase domain dimerization abolishes the fusogenic activity of MFN1. Moreover, a conserved aspartate residue trigger was found to affect mitochondrial elongation in MFN1, probably through a GTP-loading-dependent domain rearrangement. Thus, we propose a mechanistic model for MFN1-mediated mitochondrial tethering, and our results shed light on the molecular basis of mitochondrial fusion and mitofusin-related human neuromuscular disorders.</p><p>Nature   <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/nature21077">doi: 10.1038/nature21077</a></p><img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/NatureBiologicalSciencesResearch/~4/KYAO_OtMEms" width="1" />

 MicroRNAs (miRNAs) perform critical functions in normal physiology and disease by associating with Argonaute proteins and downregulating partially complementary messenger RNAs (mRNAs). Here we use clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR) and CRISPR-associated protein 9 (Cas9) genome-wide loss-of-function screening coupled with a fluorescent reporter of miRNA activity in human cells to identify new regulators of the miRNA pathway. By using iterative rounds of screening, we reveal a novel mechanism whereby target engagement by Argonaute 2 (AGO2) triggers its hierarchical, multi-site phosphorylation by CSNK1A1 on a set of highly conserved residues (S824–S834), followed by rapid dephosphorylation by the ANKRD52–PPP6C phosphatase complex. Although genetic and biochemical studies demonstrate that AGO2 phosphorylation on these residues inhibits target mRNA binding, inactivation of this phosphorylation cycle globally impairs miRNA-mediated silencing. Analysis of the transcriptome-wide binding profile of non-phosphorylatable AGO2 reveals a pronounced expansion of the target repertoire bound at steady-state, effectively reducing the active pool of AGO2 on a per-target basis. These findings support a model in which an AGO2 phosphorylation cycle stimulated by target engagement regulates miRNA:target interactions to maintain the global efficiency of miRNA-mediated silencing.

 Sexual reproduction in flowering plants involves double fertilization, the union of two sperm from pollen with two sex cells in the female embryo sac. Modern plant breeders increasingly seek to circumvent this process to produce doubled haploid individuals, which derive from the chromosome-doubled cells of the haploid gametophyte. Doubled haploid production fixes recombinant haploid genomes in inbred lines, shaving years off the breeding process. Costly, genotype-dependent tissue culture methods are used in many crops, while seed-based in vivo doubled haploid systems are rare in nature and difficult to manage in breeding programmes. The multi-billion-dollar maize hybrid seed business, however, is supported by industrial doubled haploid pipelines using intraspecific crosses to in vivo haploid inducer males derived from Stock 6, first reported in 1959 (ref. 5), followed by colchicine treatment. Despite decades of use, the mode of action remains controversial. Here we establish, through fine mapping, genome sequencing, genetic complementation, and gene editing, that haploid induction in maize (Zea mays) is triggered by a frame-shift mutation in MATRILINEAL (MTL), a pollen-specific phospholipase, and that novel edits in MTL lead to a 6.7% haploid induction rate (the percentage of haploid progeny versus total progeny). Wild-type MTL protein localizes exclusively to sperm cytoplasm, and pollen RNA-sequence profiling identifies a suite of pollen-specific genes overexpressed during haploid induction, some of which may mediate the formation of haploid seed. These findings highlight the importance of male gamete cytoplasmic components to reproductive success and male genome transmittance. Given the conservation of MTL in the cereals, this discovery may enable development of in vivo haploid induction systems to accelerate breeding in crop plants.

 Collective oscillatory behaviour is ubiquitous in nature, having a vital role in many biological processes from embryogenesis and organ development to pace-making in neuron networks. Elucidating the mechanisms that give rise to synchronization is essential to the understanding of biological self-organization. Collective oscillations in biological multicellular systems often arise from long-range coupling mediated by diffusive chemicals, by electrochemical mechanisms, or by biomechanical interaction between cells and their physical environment. In these examples, the phase of some oscillatory intracellular degree of freedom is synchronized. Here, in contrast, we report the discovery of a weak synchronization mechanism that does not require long-range coupling or inherent oscillation of individual cells. We find that millions of motile cells in dense bacterial suspensions can self-organize into highly robust collective oscillatory motion, while individual cells move in an erratic manner, without obvious periodic motion but with frequent, abrupt and random directional changes. So erratic are individual trajectories that uncovering the collective oscillations of our micrometre-sized cells requires individual velocities to be averaged over tens or hundreds of micrometres. On such large scales, the oscillations appear to be in phase and the mean position of cells typically describes a regular elliptic trajectory. We found that the phase of the oscillations is organized into a centimetre-scale travelling wave. We present a model of noisy self-propelled particles with strictly local interactions that accounts faithfully for our observations, suggesting that self-organized collective oscillatory motion results from spontaneous chiral and rotational symmetry breaking. These findings reveal a previously unseen type of long-range order in active matter systems (those in which energy is spent locally to produce non-random motion). This mechanism of collective oscillation may inspire new strategies to control the self-organization of active matter and swarming robots.

<p>There has been little research into what it’s like for police detectives to investigate the death of a child. As bluntly stated in official police guidance documents “children are not meant to die”, and coping with these circumstances, especially as a detective and parent, could involve emotional and psychological demands beyond those experienced when investigating adult murders.</p>
<p>For a new explorative <a href="http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11896-016-9218-5">study</a> in the <em>Journal of Police and Criminal Psychology, </em>Jason Roach and his colleagues surveyed 99 police detectives from 23 forces across England and Wales: most of them were white and male, and they had conducted investigations into an average of 30 adult murders and 7 unexplained child deaths. Compared to dealing with adult homicides, the detectives said they felt more pressure to solve cases involving children, found them harder to deal with emotionally, and thought more about them after the cases had ended.</p>
<p><span id="more-17559"></span></p>
<p>The detectives also considered child cases to be more complex and said they were more likely to handle them by turning to formal guidance, such as the <em>Murder Investigation Manual</em>, which was published by the Association of Chief Police Officers in 2006. This suggests they wanted to do things by the book rather than relying on intuition, which seems sensible given the relative rarity of such cases.</p>
<p>Some of the emotional effects of child cases were weaker when detectives had experienced them within the last six months. This seems counterintuitive, but the researchers speculated that while dealing with any violent crime can deliver an emotional load in the short term, the impressions of a case involving a child are harder to shake, so its severity becomes more obvious over time.</p>
<p>The research shows that seniority provided no bulwark against being shaken by these cases. In fact, more senior detectives reported higher levels of impact on their home life, and had significantly more trouble sleeping and more ruminative thoughts. They were even more likely to turn to the <em>Murder Investigation Manual</em> and other guidance to support them in these cases, suggesting that they accepted these are high-grade cases to handle. The effects of rank were also found in investigations of adult cases, but to a lesser extent.</p>
<p>The 83 per cent of the detectives who had children of their own, had a slightly different take from their childless counterparts, reporting that they were less able to control their emotions when working on the child cases, and that they were more focused on them. So the cases hit closer to home, making them both harder and more important. The younger their own children, the more emotional blowback the detectives reported experiencing.</p>
<p>This is an explorative study so the findings need to be treated carefully. But the research reveals a world that before now most of us have only encountered through the imaginations of screenwriters. Unlike their fictional counterparts, the real-life detectives didn’t report becoming hardened to child death, but if anything were more sensitive later in their careers, which suggests they may benefit from psychological support services just as much as early career officers.</p>
<p>The research also suggests that there may be value in targeting support downstream from difficult cases, to help detectives work through residual experiences that are proving hard to shift. As Roach and his team conclude, “further research must continue to explore how investigative decisions are made in such difficult and stressful circumstances if we are to give those good enough to do it as much self-protection as possible.”</p>

            <img alt="Zhu et al., 2016" class="attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image" height="150" src="http://blogs.plos.org/neuro/files/2017/01/Zhu-et-al.-2016-150x150.jpg" style="display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;" width="150" /><p>The 20<sup>th</sup> century has seen an explosion of scientific efforts made to reveal the biological substrates of cognitive functions. Research has shown that emotions and cognitive processes interact to build up complex behavioural responses and drive environmental adaptations. Fear, one of our noble and sophisticated adaptive brain functions, requires a perfect integration of emotional and cognitive inputs. Interactions of memory, learning and emotions then shape our actions. This dynamic understanding of the brain is a fairly recent development in neuroscience.</p>
<p>As <em>PLOS Biology</em> Associate Editor Gabriel Gasque writes to introduce a new PLOS Open Highlights Research Collection titled <a href="http://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.2001633">Seven Glimpses into the Emotional Brain</a>, “Cognition – the term that includes mental processes such as attention, memory, problem-solving, planning, and language – stopped being exclusively a philosophical subject approached by introspection and became a matter of empirical investigation and objective quantification.”</p>
<p>One of the articles in this Collection, published in <em>Nature Communications</em> by <a href="http://www.nature.com/articles/ncomms11096">Zhu and authors</a>, explored the mechanisms required for normal development of the amygdala, a brain region highly involved in emotions, fear and memory. In fact, the amygdala must be considered as a sensory hub for the integration of emotional stimuli. Thus, understanding neural circuits underlying emotional and cognitive states is fundamental since dysfunctions of early emotional circuits may lead to neurodevelopmental disorders such as autism and schizophrenia.</p>
<p>Among all the biomolecules able to promote or interfere with emotional and cognitive functions, we know that ephrins and their specific receptors play a major role in modulating brain plasticity and sensory integration. Ephrins are membrane-bound proteins that act as ligands of Eph receptors and have been extensively documented as fundamental for axon guidance. Ephrins have previously been shown to be key actors in cellular phenomena such as axon pruning, synaptogenesis, synaptic and structural plasticity. At the behavioural level, ephrin-B3 (eB3) has also been found to be associated with anxiety disorders and mental retardation.</p>
<p>Using specific gene-targeted mice, Zhu and authors observed that ephrin-B3 is required during a critical period in the neonatal brain for axon targeting and dendritic spine formation in the amygdala and for the development of innate fear. Xiao-Na Zhu, the leading author of this study said, “we found that eB3 deletion leads to a significant defect in innate fear behaviour, which is associated with a disruption in connections of amygdala neurons.”</p>
<p>The authors’ results are in agreement with their hypothesis that eB3 stimulates forward signaling to guide axon targeting for trans-nucleus modulation (from hippocampus to amygdala) and thereby coordinates spinogenesis and neuronal activation in the amygdala. Thus, according to these findings, eB3 may act by allowing pre- and post-synaptic structures interacting and thereby coordinates axon targeting, morphology and neuronal reactions in the amygdala.</p>
<figure class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_19095" style="width: 530px;"><a href="http://blogs.plos.org/neuro/files/2017/01/Zhu-et-al.-2016b-1.jpg"><img alt="Model of timed pre- and post-synaptic coordination for inter-nucleus neuronal connection for defensive neuronal responses.

The mushroom spinogenesis and defensive neuronal activity are disrupted in Efnb3−/− mice (from Zhu et al., 2016)</figure>
<p>Interestingly, eB3 was observed mainly in the hippocampus (a memory-related area) but not in the amygdala (a fear-related area), raising then the question of how eB3 in these structures may initiate molecular reactions to modify amygdala through wired trans-nucleus synapses. “Mechanistically”, propose the authors:“Phosphorylated EphB receptors can regulate GluN1 receptor-dependent influx of calcium, leading to synaptic function-related gene expression which eventually facilitates spine morphogenesis and hence neuronal reactions to aversive cues”.</p>
<p>We know that the brain elicits innate fear-driven responses by integrating sensory stimuli with critical brain nuclei that are involved in the initiation and modulation of amygdala-mediated emotional responses. The authors argue that because aberrant wiring of emotional circuits could lead to neurodevelopmental disorders characterized by socio-emotional impairments, these results could explain why deficiencies in Ephrin-B/EphB signaling have been linked to anxiety disorders and autism.</p>
<p>Of course, further investigations will be necessary to fully uncover the biological substrates by which our brain, especially during development, integrates sensory inputs, computes and elaborates them in order to build up complex behaviors.</p>

<p>Rice is a staple food crop in India and many other places in the world. Knowing how genetically diverse a crop is and the pattern of that diversity is important as it helps in developing suitable breeding strategies.  Indian rice varieties are known to be very genetically diverse.  However, studies have shown that there has been a loss of some of this diversity, particularly as a result of mass crop production (green revolution).  As there had not been a detailed study carried out on this trend, Singh <em>et al</em> decided to do an analysis using <span class="_Tgc">Simple Sequence Repeat (</span>SSR) markers, looking at the genetic trends of a large set of Indian rice varieties (released between 1940-2013) held in the National Gene Bank of India.</p>
<blockquote><p>Rice is a staple food crop in India and many other places in the world. Knowing how genetically diverse a crop is and the pattern of that diversity is important as it helps in developing suitable breeding strategies.</p></blockquote>
<p>Their results showed that between 1940 and 2005, genetic diversity between Indian rice varieties increased, but then began to decrease between the years 2006-2013. They concluded that the recent trait based improvement program resulted in breeders relying too heavily on certain varieties, which in turn caused the loss of gene diversity in Indian rice between 2006-2013.  This suggests that breeders need to increase the genetic diversity of this crop by introducing other varieties of Indian rice into the current breeding program.</p>

<p>Cerebellar cortical degeneration (CCD) is a brain disease for which certain breeds of dog have a genetic predisposition. Typical symptoms include a loss of co-ordination, head tilting and abnomal posturing in the dog. Age of onset and rate of progression of the disease varies between dog breeds. Histopathological findings typically include primary Purkinje neuronal degeneration and death.  The genes responsible for the disease have been identified for several dog breeds, including Old English Sheepdogs, Gordon Setters and Scottish Terriers, allowing for selective breeding to reduce the number of dogs with the condition. Fenn<em> et al</em> published the results of a study looking at the genetic cause of CCD in Hungarian Vizslas.</p>
<figure class="wp-caption alignright" id="attachment_8423" style="width: 310px;"><img alt="dog-1190024_1280" class="wp-image-8423 size-medium" height="225" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2017/01/dog-1190024_1280-300x225.jpg" width="300" /><div class="attachment-image--caption">Pixabay</div><div class="attachment-image--source"></div></figure>
<p>They reported on the case of two puppies from the same litter that had been diagnosed with CCD and euthanized shortly afterwards. Histopathological examination revealed primary Purkinje neuron loss consistent with the condition.  The article then goes on to describe how whole genome sequencing successfully identified a splice donor site mutation in the SNX14 gene, the functions of which include maintaining normal neuronal excitability and synaptic transmission, that likely to be the cause of the disease in Hungarian Vizsla dogs.</p>

<p>One of the main functions of the captive panda population is to ensure that the genetic diversity found in wild giant pandas living in their natural habitats is preserved.  Understanding the genetic contributions from each of the wild panda populations in captive pandas is essential when planning breeding programs to preserve the genetic diversity of the species.</p>
<p>Yang <em>et al</em> investigated the genetic contributions from different wild panda populations to the captive panda populations. They found that this genetic diversity was very unbalanced, with one large wild panda population (Qionglai) accounting for over 50% of the captive panda gene pool.  This is in stark comparison to the 3.6% contributed by the smaller panda population from Xiaoxiangling. The Daxiangling population was shown not to contribute to the genetic composition of the captive population at all.</p>
<blockquote><p>One of the main functions of the captive panda population is to ensure that the genetic diversity found in wild giant pandas living in their natural habitats is preserved.</p></blockquote>
<p>Breeding recommendations to increase the genetic contributions made from one of the smaller wild panda populations  may be at the expense of other similarly sized ones.  With this in mind, Yang <em>et al</em> developed three habitat-controlled breeding plans to increase the genetic contributions from the smallest wild panda populations with little to no representation currently in the captive giant panda population.  Incorporating contributions from these populations into panda breeding programs could increase their genetic representation in the captive panda population in the near future.</p>

<p>Epidermolysis bullosa is a rare inherited skin disease that causes the skin to be very fragile and blister easily. A recent article by Pausch <em>et al</em> described how artificial insemination can cause the spread of the disease in Vorderwald cattle.</p>
<figure class="wp-caption alignleft" id="attachment_8426" style="width: 310px;"><img alt="cow-7442_1920" class="wp-image-8426 size-medium" height="225" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2017/01/cow-7442_1920-300x225.jpg" width="300" /><div class="attachment-image--caption">Pixabay</div><div class="attachment-image--source"></div></figure>
<p>Whole genome haplotype-based tests allowed researchers to identify the locus responsible as the distal end of chromosome 22.  A nonsense mutation in the COL7A1 gene was shown to cause this autosomal recessive disease; the same mutation had previously been found to cause epidermolysis bullosa in Rotes Höhenvieh cattle.</p>
<p>The identification of the mutation now means that carrier animals can be detected and prevented from mating and spreading this painful skin disease.</p>

<p>Imagine the arrival of some high-tech brain device for treating mental health problems. It’s effective for many, but there’s an important side-effect. It changes your personality. Alarm ensues as campaigners warn that users risk being altered fundamentally for years to come. Now replay this scenario but replace the neuro-gizmo with good old-fashioned psychotherapy, and realise this: we’re talking fact, not fiction. <a href="http://psycnet.apa.org/psycinfo/2017-00079-001/">A new meta-analysis in <em>Psychological Bulletin</em></a> has looked at 207 psychotherapy and related studies published between 1959 and 2013, involving over 20,000 participants, with measures of personality taken repeatedly over time. The analysis has found that just a few weeks of therapy is associated with significant and long-lasting changes in clients’ personalities, especially reductions in the trait of Neuroticism and increases in Extraversion.</p>
<p><span id="more-17416"></span></p>
<p>Talk of personality change can sound unsettling because we think of our personalities as reflecting our essential “me-ness”. But from a wellbeing perspective, the trait changes uncovered by this new research are welcome and may even underlie the benefits of therapy. Neuroticism or emotional instability is an especially important risk factor for future poor mental and physical health, and meanwhile high scorers on Extraversion are known to be happier on average and more optimistic.</p>
<p>The authors of the new research, Brent Roberts at the University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign, and his colleagues, also report that personality change appeared to occur remarkably quickly. Roughly four or more weeks of therapy was enough to induce meaningful change. In fact, beyond eight weeks, more therapy was not associated with greater personality change. Therapy-related changes to trait Neuroticism were especially significant – a few weeks of therapy led to about half the amount of increase in emotional stability that you would typically expect to see someone exhibit over an entire lifetime (as a general trend, most of us slowly but surely become more emotionally stable as we get older).</p>
<p>Roberts and his team were particularly interested in whether the therapy-related personality changes they uncovered simply reflected an effect of mood or a genuine change in traits. Consistent with the idea that these were true trait changes, they found that personality change was larger in participants in treatment groups compared with those in control conditions, and that changes were found to last over the course of years without fading.</p>
<p>The researchers also uncovered a small number of “non-clinical” trials that involved healthy participants undertaking cognitive training and other interventions rather than psychotherapy, and that measured personality over time. Here too there was evidence of significant personality change, again arguing against the idea that the effects of psychotherapy on personality merely reflect a return to a non-depressed mood or to one’s natural personality pre-illness. However, Roberts and his team cautioned there were only a few of these non-clinical trials and they tended to be conducted over short time scales, so the question of whether psychotherapy is transforming a client’s personality or “remaking” it to an earlier state remains open for now.</p>
<p>Other details to emerge from the analysis: extent of observed personality change was about the same for different kinds of therapy, for instance be that CBT or psychodynamic (though hospitalisation was associated with the least amount of change); clients diagnosed with depression or personality disorders exhibited the greatest personality change compared with other conditions; and the size of the effects were the same across gender and age. This last finding concerning age is especially intriguing. As the researchers said, it appears to support “the plasticity principle that personality is an open system and amenable to change” through the lifespan.</p>
<p>There are some notable limitations to the new analysis, especially the fact that the studies under review almost entirely relied on clients’ ratings of their own personalities (though the fact that not all traits changed positively in response to therapy argues against a general effect on self-presentation or personality-related self-esteem). The research also leaves unanswered a big question for the future: just <em>how</em> is psychotherapy enacting these personality trait changes?</p>
<p>Cautions noted, this important paper shines a welcome light on a little discussed consequence of psychotherapy, and it feeds into a broader movement in clinical psychology that is recognising the important role of personality in mental health. In the near future we may see the development of therapeutic interventions that more deliberately target personality trait changes, rather than these changes being a kind of side-effect. The research also speaks to an ongoing debate in personality science about just how much personality changes, with the new findings arguing against the idea that change can only ever occur slowly.</p>
<p>“Personality traits are not only robust predictors of important life outcomes, but also appear amenable to intervention,” Roberts and his team concluded. “This fact opens the door to a new era of research that more strongly links personality and clinical psychology, and other groups, such as educational psychologists and economists, who are interested in changing people and their behaviours in order to help them with their lives.”</p>

 Accurate genome inheritance by daughter cells requires that sister chromatids in the mother attach to microtubules emanating from opposite poles of the mitotic spindle (bi-orientation). A surveillance mechanism named the spindle assembly checkpoint (SAC) monitors the microtubule attachment process, temporarily halting sister chromatid separation and mitotic exit until completion of bi-orientation1. SAC failure results in abnormal chromosome numbers (aneuploidy), a hallmark of many tumours. The HORMA domain protein MAD2 is a subunit of the SAC effector mitotic checkpoint complex (MCC). Structural conversion from open to closed MAD2 is required for MAD2 incorporation in MCC1. In vitro, MAD2 conversion and MCC assembly requires several hours2–4, while the SAC response in cells is established in a few minutes5–7. To address this discrepancy, we reconstituted with purified components a near-complete SAC signalling system and monitored MCC assembly with real-time sensors. Dramatic acceleration of MAD2 conversion and MCC assembly was observed when MPS1 phosphorylated the MAD1:MAD2 complex, triggering its template function in the MAD2 conversion and contributing to the establishment of a physical platform for MCC assembly. Thus, catalytic activation of the SAC depends on regulated protein-protein interactions that accelerate the spontaneous but rate-limiting conversion of MAD2 required for MCC assembly.

            <p>Automated testing is a paramount activity in agile development. Tests act as a guard to catch and localize software defects early. Production code relies on automated tests, however tests do not often have the luxury to be automatically checked by someone or something else. Therefore, high quality tests should be at place to ensure tests are doing a good job. There are many aspects to test quality, such as test effectiveness, test maintainability, etc. Usually, deviations from practices considered as good may lead to code smells, which in test code we call test-smells. Much empirical work has already been channelled through measuring the effectiveness of tests, however there is a lack of empirical evidence for the impact of test-smells on test quality. In this talk I will be focused on giving a brief introduction to software testing, and its importance. I will then explain the practices for writing good tests, and discuss the implications when these good practices are not met.</p>

<p>Understanding jokes requires a certain amount of mental agility, psychologists tell us, because you need to recognise a sudden shift in meaning, or appreciate the blending of odd contexts that don’t normally go together. A <a href="http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10339-016-0789-y">new study</a> in the journal <em>Cognitive Processing</em> has tested whether intelligence plays the same role in the appreciation of sick or black humour: the kind of jokes that make light of death, illness and the vulnerable. Consistent with past research linking intelligence with joke appreciation, the participants who most liked cartoons based on black humour also scored highest on verbal and non-verbal IQ.</p>
<p><span id="more-17342"></span></p>
<p>Fourteen researchers, led by <a href="http://www.psychologie-in-wien.at/ueber-uns/univprofdrmag-ulrike-willinger/">Ulrike Willinger</a> at the Medical University of Vienna, asked 156 participants, with an average age of 33 and including 76 women, to rate their comprehension and enjoyment of 12 black humour cartoons taken from <em>The Black Book</em> by Uli Stein. For instance, one cartoon depicted a confused man holding a public telephone, the voice coming from the phone saying: “Here is the answering machine of the self-help association for Alzheimer patients. If you still remember your topic, please speak after the tone.” The participants also completed basic tests of their verbal and non-verbal IQ and answered questions about their mood, aggressive tendencies and educational background.</p>
<p>The researchers identified three distinct groups of participants based on their understanding and appreciation for the sick cartoons (incidentally, age and gender appeared not to be relevant factors). One group showed the highest sick humour appreciation and comprehension, and they also scored the highest on verbal and non-verbal IQ, were better educated, and scored lower for aggression and bad mood. This fits with past research showing that sense of humour correlates with IQ, but refutes the somewhat commonly held belief that people who like black humour tend to be grumpy and perhaps a little prone to sadism.</p>
<p>A second group showed moderate comprehension and the lowest sick joke enjoyment. These people had average intelligence scores, but showed the most negative mood and the highest aggression. So perhaps opposite to what you might expect, this research found no evidence that grumpy, aggressive people enjoy sick or black humour. Meanwhile, the final group showed moderate sick humour comprehension and preference, and they had average intelligence scores, generally positive mood and moderate aggression scores.</p>
<p>Willinger and her team said their findings suggested black humour processing is a “complex information-processing task”, and were consistent with past research suggesting that low mood impairs humour appreciation, this seeming to be true even in the case of sick jokes. Apparently it takes a certain amount of intelligence, good mood and calmness to recognise and enjoy the “playful fiction” of black humour.</p>

<p>Chemotherapy during the later stages of pregnancy is generally thought to have no significant detrimental effect on fetal development. As a woman’s reproductive lifespan is determined before birth, it is important to understand the effects of chemotherapy on the ovaries of the developing female fetus.</p>
<figure class="wp-caption alignright" id="attachment_8411" style="width: 209px;"><img alt="Wikimedia, cc" class="wp-image-8411 size-medium" height="300" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2017/01/598px-Maternity_Curves-199x300.jpg" width="199" /><div class="attachment-image--caption">Wikimedia, cc</div><div class="attachment-image--source"></div></figure>
<p>Female egg cells develop from germ cells, which are enclosed within ovarian follicles. Follicle development begins 17 weeks into the pregnancy and is not complete until birth. Researchers used a novel <em>in vitro</em> method of mouse cell culture to investigate the effects of etoposide, an anti-cancer drug, on ovarian development.</p>
<p>It was found that prior to follicle formation, presence of etoposide reduced both follicle production and follicle health. After the complete development of the follicle, etoposide had little effect on follicle health and numbers. Albeit preliminary, these findings suggest that exposure to etoposide could have long term effects on the future fertility of the female fetus, potentially reducing the fertility window and likelihood of conception.</p>

<p>Anchoring molecules which bind phagocytic receptors to the cell surface of tumors enables the immune system to recognize, and attack, tumor cells. This effect can be further optimized by applying LPS, a TLR-4 agonist which is toxic to humans, to the tumor cell surface. <a href="https://bmccancer.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12885-016-2982-x">Caisovà and colleagues present a study</a> conducted to optimize this therapy for human treatment.</p>
<p>A mouse-model which had been transplanted with B16-F10 melanoma cells was used to test several combinations of TLR agonists and phagocytosis-stimulating ligands, to find the most effective treatment with low toxicity to humans.</p>
<p>Of all the combinations studied, it was found that R-848 and covalently anchored mannan-SMCC had the best therapeutic effect, reducing tumor size <em>in vivo</em>. The addition of heat-killed <em>Listeria monocytogenes</em> further increased mouse survival rate to 83.3%. Furthermore, binding of poly(I:C) to tumor cells protected against re-transplantation with no pathological symptoms observed for over a year after treatment.</p>

<p>Mesothelioma is a malignancy of the lung mesothelium cells usually associated with asbestos exposure.

<p>In some malignant cells, <em>HOX</em> genes become dysregulated, increasing cell proliferation. It was shown that treating mesothelioma-derived cell lines with HXR9, a peptide antagonist of HOX protein, leads to tumor cell death (apoptosis) whilst leaving healthy cells intact. Next, HXR9 treatment was tested in mice with mesothelioma. A significant inhibition of the tumor growth was observed, implying that <em>HOX</em> genes may be an important therapeutic target in mesothelioma therapy.</p>

<p>Different drugs elicit a different response depending on the patient; understanding the reasons for this may not only improve treatment, but the development of future anti-cancer drugs. Tailoring treatment to the individual ensures the optimum patient response, reducing disease progression and drug toxicity. Currently, using biomarkers to tailor cancer therapy focuses on the prognosis and prediction of disease.</p>
<p><a href="http://bmccancer.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12885-016-2886-9">A review by Shahil Amin and Oliver Bathe</a> discusses the potential of using biomarkers in an alternative way, to assess a patients’ response to treatment. The authors explore the implications of treatment response biomarkers which, they argue, may not only benefit individual patients, by minimizing exposure to drugs which may be ineffective or toxic, but could also revolutionize how drugs are developed and clinical trials are conducted.</p>

<p>A meta-analysis and systematic review by Zhao et al. identifies a significant dose-response relationship between alcohol intake and risk of developing prostate cancer. The study aimed to reduce misclassification error, which occurs when participants who are defined as non-drinkers may have consumed alcohol regularly in the past. The study showed that when misclassification error is eliminated, there is a significant increase in prostate cancer risk in low-moderate drinkers when compared to those who abstain from alcohol.</p>
<figure class="wp-caption alignleft" id="attachment_8415" style="width: 210px;"><img alt="dilettantiquity, Flickr, cc." class="size-medium wp-image-8415" height="300" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2017/01/3434492702_d3bc6ef921_o-200x300.jpg" width="200" /><div class="attachment-image--caption">dilettantiquity, Flickr, cc.</div><div class="attachment-image--source"></div></figure>
<p>In studies with no misclassification error, an alcohol consumption of 1.3-24mg per day may increase prostate cancer risk by as much as 24%. This presents an increase in 16% when compared to studies which include former drinkers in the abstinence group. As well as providing important data regarding the long term effects low alcohol consumption has on health, this study highlights the effect misclassification errors can have on data.</p>

<p>British workers spend on average one hour commuting each day, and 57 per cent of commuters make their daily journeys by car. But this is a part of our lives we don’t talk much about, beyond the odd epithet about the traffic; maybe because it’s a strange time, betwixt home and work but not fully either. Potentially, the drive to work is a haven: I recall my mother’s glove compartment crammed with audio books, so she could enjoy those stretches of solo time. But it’s more liable to be caught in a crossfire of worries, fretting about Daniel’s pensive moods at the breakfast table, or anticipating criticisms about the last sales pitch. <a href="http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/1359432X.2016.1228628">New research</a> from the University of Haifa suggests these psychological stressors can make our time on the road not just unpleasant, but dangerous as well.</p>
<p><span id="more-17175"></span></p>
<p>Keren Turgeman-Lupo and Michal Biron collected data from 216 employees at a manufacturing organisation (average age 35, with an average driving commute of 16 miles). They surveyed the employees about what they believed was generally seen as acceptable behaviour when on the road, such as whether it is okay to receive phone calls or texts or to let your attention wander to non-driving concerns. Participants also reported how often they committed dangerous driving behaviours such as overtaking on the inside lane or driving too close to the vehicle ahead. Participants who believed less safe driving-related habits were normal and acceptable also tended to drive more dangerously. But what shaped the commuters’ beliefs?</p>
<p>Turgeman-Lupo and Biron found two types of psychological stress had an influence. The first was the degree of conflict workers said they experienced between their family life and the workplace. Higher work-family conflict was associated with more dangerous driving, and this seemed to be explained through its link to participants’ beliefs about what kinds of driving-related behaviours are acceptable. The commute is a liminal period between home and work, such that thoughts and preoccupations may become especially salient, disrupting attention or even leading commuters to fix things by trying to solve domestic situations through messages or calls.</p>
<p>The other relevant stress factor was supervisor abuse. We know that being given a hard time by a manager impairs attention at work, so these preoccupations could also spill over to the commute. Moreover, evidence suggests that one pernicious effect of supervisor abuse is making people feel that they have to ingratiate themselves to avoid further punishment, which could encourage deliberately diverting their attention towards work issues while working, just to get ahead. As with work-life conflict, participants who reported higher levels of supervisor abuse, such as “my supervisor breaks promises he/she makes” admitted to more dangerous driving thanks to their beliefs about what kind of driving-related habits are normal.</p>
<p>Work-related stress can kill us slowly, but this research warns us of one way it can kill quickly, by siphoning away the mental resources that we need to safely steer tons of metal and glass, at high speeds, through a rapidly shifting landscape. It’s another reason why it’s so important for organisations to have humane management practices, liveable demands on worker time, and procedures to eliminate bullying. And it suggests another role organisations can take: to educate their workforce on safe commuting norms and emphasise their importance. Work should wait for the workplace; leave the commute in peace.</p>

 The genome of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) frequently contains deletions of tumour suppressor gene loci, most notably SMAD4, which is homozygously deleted in nearly one-third of cases. As loss of neighbouring housekeeping genes can confer collateral lethality, we sought to determine whether loss of the metabolic gene malic enzyme 2 (ME2) in the SMAD4 locus would create cancer-specific metabolic vulnerability upon targeting of its paralogous isoform ME3. The mitochondrial malic enzymes (ME2 and ME3) are oxidative decarboxylases that catalyse the conversion of malate to pyruvate and are essential for NADPH regeneration and reactive oxygen species homeostasis. Here we show that ME3 depletion selectively kills ME2-null PDAC cells in a manner consistent with an essential function for ME3 in ME2-null cancer cells. Mechanistically, integrated metabolomic and molecular investigation of cells deficient in mitochondrial malic enzymes revealed diminished NADPH production and consequent high levels of reactive oxygen species. These changes activate AMP activated protein kinase (AMPK), which in turn directly suppresses sterol regulatory element-binding protein 1 (SREBP1)-directed transcription of its direct targets including the BCAT2 branched-chain amino acid transaminase 2) gene. BCAT2 catalyses the transfer of the amino group from branched-chain amino acids to α-ketoglutarate (α-KG) thereby regenerating glutamate, which functions in part to support de novo nucleotide synthesis. Thus, mitochondrial malic enzyme deficiency, which results in impaired NADPH production, provides a prime ‘collateral lethality’ therapeutic strategy for the treatment of a substantial fraction of patients diagnosed with this intractable disease.

 Temperate viruses can become dormant in their host cells, a process called lysogeny. In every infection, such viruses decide between the lytic and the lysogenic cycles, that is, whether to replicate and lyse their host or to lysogenize and keep the host viable. Here we show that viruses (phages) of the SPbeta group use a small-molecule communication system to coordinate lysis–lysogeny decisions. During infection of its Bacillus host cell, the phage produces a six amino-acids-long communication peptide that is released into the medium. In subsequent infections, progeny phages measure the concentration of this peptide and lysogenize if the concentration is sufficiently high. We found that different phages encode different versions of the communication peptide, demonstrating a phage-specific peptide communication code for lysogeny decisions. We term this communication system the ‘arbitrium’ system, and further show that it is encoded by three phage genes: aimP, which produces the peptide; aimR, the intracellular peptide receptor; and aimX, a negative regulator of lysogeny. The arbitrium system enables a descendant phage to ‘communicate’ with its predecessors, that is, to estimate the amount of recent previous infections and hence decide whether to employ the lytic or lysogenic cycle.

 Reactive astrocytes are strongly induced by central nervous system (CNS) injury and disease, but their role is poorly understood. Here we show that a subtype of reactive astrocytes, which we termed A1, is induced by classically activated neuroinflammatory microglia. We show that activated microglia induce A1 astrocytes by secreting Il-1α, TNF and C1q, and that these cytokines together are necessary and sufficient to induce A1 astrocytes. A1 astrocytes lose the ability to promote neuronal survival, outgrowth, synaptogenesis and phagocytosis, and induce the death of neurons and oligodendrocytes. Death of axotomized CNS neurons in vivo is prevented when the formation of A1 astrocytes is blocked. Finally, we show that A1 astrocytes are abundant in various human neurodegenerative diseases including Alzheimer’s, Huntington’s and Parkinson’s disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and multiple sclerosis. Taken together these findings help to explain why CNS neurons die after axotomy, strongly suggest that A1 astrocytes contribute to the death of neurons and oligodendrocytes in neurodegenerative disorders, and provide opportunities for the development of new treatments for these diseases.

 Cyclic-nucleotide-gated channels are essential for vision and olfaction. They belong to the voltage-gated ion channel superfamily but their activities are controlled by intracellular cyclic nucleotides instead of transmembrane voltage. Here we report a 3.5-Å-resolution single-particle electron cryo-microscopy structure of a cyclic-nucleotide-gated channel from Caenorhabditis elegans in the cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP)-bound open state. The channel has an unusual voltage-sensor-like domain, accounting for its deficient voltage dependence. A carboxy-terminal linker connecting S6 and the cyclic-nucleotide-binding domain interacts directly with both the voltage-sensor-like domain and the pore domain, forming a gating ring that couples conformational changes triggered by cyclic nucleotide binding to the gate. The selectivity filter is lined by the carboxylate side chains of a functionally important glutamate and three rings of backbone carbonyls. This structure provides a new framework for understanding mechanisms of ion permeation, gating and channelopathy of cyclic-nucleotide-gated channels and cyclic nucleotide modulation of related channels.

 Interleukin-17 (IL-17) is a major pro-inflammatory cytokine: it mediates responses to pathogens or tissue damage, and drives autoimmune diseases. Little is known about its role in the nervous system. Here we show that IL-17 has neuromodulator-like properties in Caenorhabditis elegans. IL-17 can act directly on neurons to alter their response properties and contribution to behaviour. Using unbiased genetic screens, we delineate an IL-17 signalling pathway and show that it acts in the RMG hub interneurons. Disrupting IL-17 signalling reduces RMG responsiveness to input from oxygen sensors, and renders sustained escape from 21% oxygen transient and contingent on additional stimuli. Over-activating IL-17 receptors abnormally heightens responses to 21% oxygen in RMG neurons and whole animals. IL-17 deficiency can be bypassed by optogenetic stimulation of RMG. Inducing IL-17 expression in adults can rescue mutant defects within 6 h. These findings reveal a non-immunological role of IL-17 modulating circuit function and behaviour.

            <p>
 Self-organized regular vegetation patterns are widespread and thought to mediate ecosystem functions such as productivity and robustness, but the mechanisms underlying their origin and maintenance remain disputed. Particularly controversial are landscapes of overdispersed (evenly spaced) elements, such as North American Mima mounds, Brazilian murundus, South African heuweltjies, and, famously, Namibian fairy circles. Two competing hypotheses are currently debated. On the one hand, models of scale-dependent feedbacks, whereby plants facilitate neighbours while competing with distant individuals, can reproduce various regular patterns identified in satellite imagery. Owing to deep theoretical roots and apparent generality, scale-dependent feedbacks are widely viewed as a unifying and near-universal principle of regular-pattern formation despite scant empirical evidence. On the other hand, many overdispersed vegetation patterns worldwide have been attributed to subterranean ecosystem engineers such as termites, ants, and rodents. Although potentially consistent with territorial competition, this interpretation has been challenged theoretically and empirically and (unlike scale-dependent feedbacks) lacks a unifying dynamical theory, fuelling scepticism about its plausibility and generality. Here we provide a general theoretical foundation for self-organization of social-insect colonies, validated using data from four continents, which demonstrates that intraspecific competition between territorial animals can generate the large-scale hexagonal regularity of these patterns. However, this mechanism is not mutually exclusive with scale-dependent feedbacks. Using Namib Desert fairy circles as a case study, we present field data showing that these landscapes exhibit multi-scale patterning—previously undocumented in this system—that cannot be explained by either mechanism in isolation. These multi-scale patterns and other emergent properties, such as enhanced resistance to and recovery from drought, instead arise from dynamic interactions in our theoretical framework, which couples both mechanisms. The potentially global extent of animal-induced regularity in vegetation—which can modulate other patterning processes in functionally important ways—emphasizes the need to integrate multiple mechanisms of ecological self-organization.

<p><em>By</em> <a href="http://www.psychologywriter.org.uk/">Christian Jarrett</a></p>
<p>Between 1837 and 1860 Charles Darwin kept a diary of every book he read, including <em>An Essay on the Principle of Population</em>, <em>Principles of Geology</em> and <em>Vestiges of the Natural History of Creation</em>. There were many others: 687 English non-fiction titles alone, meaning that he averaged one book every ten days. After Darwin finished each one, how did he decide what to read next? In this decision, a scientist like Darwin was confronted with a problem similar to that afflicting the squirrel in search of nuts. Is it better to thoroughly search one area (or topic), or to continually jump to new areas (topics)? Foraging, whether for nuts or information, comes down to a choice between exploitation and exploration. In a <a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0010027716302840">new paper</a> in <em>Cognition</em>, a team led by Jaimie Murdock has analysed the contents of the English non-fiction books Darwin read, and the order he read them in, to find out his favoured information-gathering approach and how it changed over time.</p>
<p><span id="more-16972"></span></p>
<p>The researchers analysed digital versions of 665 of the books Darwin read, counting and categorising the topics mentioned within. From this, they calculated whether each successive book reflected a foray into surprising new territory or a deeper dig into a similar subject area. They found that Darwin began his note-keeping period with a greater emphasis on exploitation, largely tending to master one area at a time, rather than jumping sporadically from topic to topic. Over time, and as we get nearer to his writing of his masterpiece <em>On The Origin of Species</em>, he shifts to a greater emphasis on exploration: more sporadic and surprising jumps to new topics.</p>
<p>This finding is unexpected in the sense that it is usually considered optimal for a forager – be that a squirrel or academic – to show the opposite pattern to Darwin, to scope out many different areas before later zooming in on a particular area for deeper scrutiny. Murdock and his team propose two explanations. First, perhaps Darwin had already shown a stronger emphasis on exploration earlier in his career, before he began keeping a reading diary and so missed by the current analysis. Or second, perhaps Darwin required an earlier phase of exploitation and mastery of narrower areas as a way to build his confidence and hone his abilities.</p>
<p>Another way the researchers approached Darwin’s reading choices was to see whether the order he went from book to book was more surprising, in terms of topic changes, compared with the natural progression of topics as reflected in the order in which books were published. This showed that his chosen journey through the reading material was more exploratory and surprising than the chronological progression of ideas based on publication history. That’s to say, over the course of his career, he deliberately mixed and matched what he read, bringing disparate ideas together, rather than passively encountering new ideas as they emerged.</p>
<p>Lending validity to the new findings are the fact the identified phases of relative exploitation and exploration in Darwin’s reading map well onto the biographical phases in his career. First, as he assembled his research journals from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Darwin#Voyage_of_the_Beagle">the Beagle voyage</a> from 1836 onward, he was in a clear exploitation phase of reading. Then from 1846, he began a period of intense <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Darwin#Geology_books.2C_barnacles.2C_evolutionary_research">research into barnacles</a> (having realised their taxonomic study had been neglected in the literature), and this coincides with a shift in his reading style from exploitation to exploration, especially in the sense of reading books on topics that were new to him compared with his past reading habits. Finally, from 1854, as he began <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Darwin#Publication_of_the_theory_of_natural_selection">preparations for writing <em>Origin</em></a>, Darwin’s reading enters its most exploratory phase, in terms not only of reading topics that were fresh relative to his past reading material, but also literally fresh from one book to the next.</p>
<p>The researchers said their study represented the first time that information theory has been applied in this way to study the reading and research habits of a single individual. In principle, the same kind of analysis could now be applied to any other individual living or dead, for whom their reading history is available. In time it will be fascinating to see what similarities and differences there are between Darwin’s intellectual journey and those embarked upon by others.</p>
