              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/chameleon-force-new-dark-energy-experiment">‘Chameleon’ forces remain elusive in a new dark energy experiment</a></h4>

              
                <p>A chameleon-like force that shifts its nature based on its environment could explain a major physics quandary: how the mysterious substance called dark energy is compelling the cosmos to expand faster and faster. But a new experiment <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41567-022-01706-9">casts doubt</a> on some chameleon theories, researchers report August 25 in <em>Nature Physics</em>.</p>



<p>The chameleon force would be a fifth type of force beyond the basic four: gravitational, strong, weak and electromagnetic. And like a chameleon changing its colors, the hypothetical fifth force would morph depending on the density of its surroundings. In dense environments like Earth, this fifth force would be feeble, camouflaging its effects. In the sparseness of space, the force would be stronger and long-ranged.</p>





<p>This force would result from a chameleon field — an addition to the known fields in physics, such as electric, magnetic and gravitational fields. A chameleon field with these morphing properties could drive the <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/century/wild-universe-einstein-general-relativity-spacetime">accelerating expansion of the universe</a> without disagreeing with measurements on Earth.</p>



<p>But it’s a challenge to suss out such a changeling force. On Earth, says astrophysicist Jianhua He of Nanjing University in China, “it’s very, very tiny. That’s the most difficult part.”</p>



<p>So He and colleagues designed a detector to search for a subtle fifth force. A wheel with plastic films attached spins past another film sitting on a magnetically levitated piece of graphite. If a chameleon force really exists, the films spinning by would cause a periodic force on the levitating plastic, pulling it up and down. (Gravity also acts this way, but thanks to the device’s design, it should be much weaker than a chameleon force.)</p>



<p>The team was able to rule out a category of chameleon theories. In the future, the researchers hope to improve their results by chilling their device to allow for more sensitive measurements.</p>

          <p>At PLOS I&rsquo;m part of the Executive Team and lead the Publishing &amp; Partnerships Team. As part of the Executive Team my role is to be a strategic thought partner for the CEO and other team leaders. In leading the Publishing &amp; Partnerships Team, my focus is ensuring the PLOS journals reflect the interests of the communities they serve,&nbsp; facilitate the co-creation of paths to Open Science while ensuring PLOS&rsquo; financial sustainability to continue our mission. This includes developing new business models to enable more equitable and regionally appropriate ways to support Open Access and Open Science, developing new publications that enable Open Science communities of practice, and developing our relationships and networks with communities in different countries and regions.</p>
        </div>
      </div>
    


<p>Doing this work takes a great team and my role is to both support the leaders in my group and to raise questions and suggestions so that we work towards the best outcomes. It&rsquo;s important to me that we understand the challenges that face our communities and listen so that we can work with them to develop solutions.</p>



<p><strong>During your time at PLOS, what initiatives have you been involved with to help lead others in the way research is communicated?</strong></p>



<p>Quite a few! I can think of a few highlights. I&rsquo;ve worked alongside <a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2022/08/what-drives-us-changing-the-landscape-to-make-open-access-more-affordable/">Sara </a>and colleagues across PLOS to develop our new business models, which provide alternatives to APCs,removing barriers to inclusion in sharing research while addressing cost inflation for research-intensive institutions which is vital to allow a greater diversity of voices and research findings to be represented. Another highlight for me was the development and launch of <a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2021/04/launching-new-journals-2021/">new publishing venues</a> to enable co-creation of Open Science communities of practice in fields that are vital to addressing the challenges society faces globally,&nbsp; including climate, public health and sustainability. And I work with <a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2022/08/what-drives-us-collaborating-globally-to-build-trust-in-science/">Roheena</a> and the regional publishing directors to developour networks in different regions so that we can better understand the cultural, political and economic contexts in which our communities are working.&nbsp;</p>



<p>My contribution is only one small part of each of these exciting initiatives and it&rsquo;s great to have the opportunity to be involved in so many projects that are not only reshaping PLOS, but have the potential to deepen our understanding of researchers&rsquo; needs globally and drive necessary change in science communicationt</p>



<p><strong>Why do you think this is important for science?</strong></p>



<p>PLOS has from the outset been focused on catalyzing broad-scale systemic change. In order to achieve this we need to directly address the perception of objectivity and empirical research, through focusing on driving Open Science and addressing the cultural and economic contexts that influence research and research-sharing in science and medicine.&nbsp; Openness in itself, while valuable, does not tackle inequality in the scholarly communications ecosystem, or increase inclusion.&nbsp; Without equitable participation in knowledge-sharing,&nbsp; hearing the voices that have been missing, and a willingness to experiment and explore, we will fall short of the goal of Open Science to increase the benefits of research for society globally.</p>



<p><strong>What does it mean to you personally to be involved in work like this?</strong></p>



<p>I believe that a great team, or group, can achieve more than any one individual which is very much in line with the values of Open Science. In an Open Science ecosystem, each individual contribution builds on and contributes to the whole body of knowledge which is bigger than any one person. And making a real difference in addressing the legacy of devaluing knowledge from particular groups or regions is extremely important. &nbsp;I also love science and I&rsquo;m fascinated by the influences of culture and context on scientific research and I feel very lucky to be able to work at something that interests me and where I have lots of opportunities to learn.</p>



<p><strong>By the end of your career, what do you hope people will think about your contribution?</strong></p>



<p>I haven&rsquo;t given too much thought to what people will think, but I hope that my contributions will have made a difference. I&rsquo;ve been lucky enough to work with some amazing people &ndash; both scientists and publishing professionals &ndash; from whom I have learned a lot and with whom I&rsquo;ve had a lot of fun too! I&nbsp; have former team members who have gone on to develop their careers in ways that they have found rewarding and where they&rsquo;ve also been able to influence and drive change and I have valued the opportunity to work with them. And I hope I will have contributed in some way to address injustice and imbalance in the system &ndash; and maybe even been part of making it possible for us to take advantage of the opportunities offered by a system based on Open Science.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/mealworms-sugar-new-seasoning-smell-meat">A new seasoning smells like meat thanks to sugar — and mealworms</a></h4>

              
                <p>A spoonful of sugar may help the mealworms go down.</p>



<p>Adding sugars to powdered, cooked mealworms <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88_d5BghR88&amp;list=PL-qHxGvFeZV11YAygI6lgZ6yOq2nWwvv7&amp;index=5">creates a seasoning</a> with an appetizing “meatlike” odor, researchers report August 24 at the American Chemical Society fall meeting in Chicago.</p>



<p>Some insects have been found to be an environmentally friendly alternative to other animal protein <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/silicon-valley-entrepreneurs-insect-cricket-farming-food-agriculture">because they require less land and water to raise</a> (<em>SN: 5/11/19</em>). But many people in the United States and other Western countries, where insects aren’t eaten widely, generally find the idea of chomping down on bugs unappetizing.</p>





<p>“There aren&#8217;t a lot of people ready to fry up a whole skillet of crickets and eat them fresh,” says Julie Lesnik, a biological anthropologist at Wayne State University in Detroit who wasn’t involved in the new research. Finding out how to make insect-based foods more appealing could be key to making them more mainstream.</p>



<p>And one successful insect-based product could have a snowball effect for similar food. “It&#8217;s really great that this research is happening, because at any point this might be the thing that people figure out and then it explodes,” says Brenden Campbell, an insect agriculturist based in Eugene, Ore. He has studied mealworms and created a company called Planet Bugs to, in part, make insect-based food products.</p>



<p>In a previous study, chemist In Hee Cho of Wonkwang University in South Korea and colleagues analyzed the <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7372989/">odors given off by mealworms that were steamed, roasted or deep-fried</a>. Steamed mealworms produced a sweet smell, like corn, while roasted and fried mealworms released chemicals more similar to meat and seafood.</p>



<p>In their latest work, the team then keyed in on what combinations of water, sugars and cooking time produced a particularly meaty smell, and tested these concoctions with volunteers to figure out which smelled the most appealing. &nbsp;</p>



<p>Using insects ground up or in seasonings, like Cho’s team did, could help people get past their hesitations about eating whole bugs, says Amy Wright, who has written a book on eating bugs. (She, for one, has no qualms. A literature professor at Austin Peay State University in Clarksville, Tenn., Wright used to keep mealworms in her apartment, which she would use in sandwiches and guacamole.)</p>



<p>“There are plenty of things that are disgusting to us, but we have engineered around it,” Lesnik says. “We&#8217;re just seeing insects being treated like any other food, and yeah, we&#8217;re talking aroma … but that&#8217;s what the engineers of Doritos are doing.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/earliest-known-hominid-limb-fossils-sahelanthropus-tchadensis">7-million-year-old limb fossils may be from the earliest known hominid</a></h4>

              
                <p>In 2001, researchers unearthed a partial fossil leg bone and two forearm bones in the central African nation of Chad. Those fossils come from the earliest known hominid, which lived around 7 million years ago, and reveal that the creature walked upright both on the ground and in the trees, a new study proposes.</p>



<p>But a lively debate surrounds the fossils, concerning whether they actually belong to the hominid species, known as <em>Sahelanthropus tchadensis</em>, or to an ancient ape, and to what extent either species could have adopted a two-legged gait. These have become vexing questions as scientists increasingly suspect that ape and hominid species evolved a variety of ways to walk upright, some more efficient than others, around 7 million years ago.</p>





<p>Since its discovery, the leg bone has also triggered competing accusations of scientific misconduct and an official investigation by the French government–funded research organization CNRS in Paris.</p>



<p>Previously, skull, jaw and tooth finds uncovered at the Chad site in 2001 and 2004 were <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/untangling-ancient-roots-earliest-hominid-shows-new-improved-face">classified as remnants of <em>S. tchadensis</em></a> (<em>SN: 4/6/05</em>). The finds are the only other fossils attributed to the species, though some researchers have also since suggested that those fossils represent an ancient ape instead.</p>



<p>Analyses of the three limb bones show that they belong to the previously identified <em>Sahelanthropus</em> species, say paleontologists Guillaume Daver and Franck Guy, both of the University of Poitiers in France, and their colleagues. And internal and external features of the leg bone indicate <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-022-04901-z">that <em>Sahelanthropus</em> walked upright</a>, the scientists report August 24 in <em>Nature</em>. Shapes and structures of the two forearm bones suggest that the hominid moved on two legs through trees while grasping branches with its hands, the team says.</p>



<p>“The Chadian species has a set of anatomical features that clearly indicate that our oldest known [hominid] representative [walked] on the ground and in the trees,” Guy says. It’s hard to tell how efficiently or how fast <em>Sahelanthropus</em> moved on two legs, he adds.</p>



<p>Guy’s team studied 3-D digital models of the fossils derived from CT scans. The leg bone was compared with fossils of ancient apes and other hominids and with modern apes and humans. Traits including thickening of the leg bone’s tough outer layer at key points and the presence of an internal bony projection near the hip joint signal an upright stance, the scientists say.</p>



<p>Fossils from the African site, including the three limb bones, suggest that <em>Sahelanthropus</em> was the earliest known hominid, agrees paleoanthropologist Kristian Carlson of the University of Southern California in Los Angeles, who did not participate in the new study. But exactly how it moved while upright remains unknown, he says. <em>Sahelanthropus</em> exhibits a mix of upper leg and forearm traits that differs from those of living apes and humans, suggesting it adopted a novel posture and limb movements while walking.</p>



<p>Whatever stance <em>Sahelanthropus</em> assumed, it probably resembled that of two other early hominids, roughly <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/human-ancestor-gets-leg-walking">6-million-year-old <em>Orrorin tugenensis</em></a> and <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/early-ancestors-come-together-humanitys-roots-may-lie-single-diverse-genus">more than 5-million-year-old <em>Ardipithecus kadabba</em></a>, says paleoanthropologist Yohannes Haile-Selassie, director of the Institute of Human Origins at Arizona State University in Tempe (<em>SN: 9/11/04; SN: 3/3/04</em>). Walking abilities of those hominids remain poorly understood due to limited fossils — a partial leg bone for <em>O. tugenensis</em> and a toe bone for the <em>Ardipithecus</em> species.</p>



<p>Haile-Selassie regards all three hominids as part of a single genus that evolved from around 7 million to 5 million years ago. On that issue, “the debate is open, even between members of our team,” Guy says.</p>



<p>Another debate concerns the upper leg’s internal bony projection that the researchers cite as crucial for standing upright. That trait sometimes appears in modern African apes and occasionally is absent in humans, paleoanthropologist Marine Cazenave of the American Museum of Natural History in New York City and colleagues report in the June <em>Journal of Human Evolution</em>. The presence of <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jhevol.2022.103183">this bony growth does not definitively show that <em>Sahelanthropus</em> walked upright</a>, Cazenave says.</p>



<p>Other researchers contend that the <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0047248420301597">leg bone most likely comes from an ancient ape</a> — not a hominid — that may have occasionally walked upright. Shape measurements, including curvature of the fossil’s shaft, closely resemble those of modern chimps’ upper leg bones, University of Poitiers paleoanthropologist Roberto Macchiarelli and colleagues reported in December 2020 in the <em>Journal of Human Evolution</em>.</p>



<p>“There may have been ancient apes that had distinctive types of [upright movement] unlike any living apes, including humans,” says paleoanthropologist Bernard Wood of George Washington University in Washington, D.C., who was a coauthor of the 2020 study.</p>



<p>Here is where charges of scientific misconduct come into play. The 2020 study was based on measurements of the <em>Sahelanthropus</em> leg fossil taken in 2004 by a University of Poitiers graduate student conducting a project on how fossilization affects bones.</p>



<p>That student, Aude Bergeret-Medina, was given access to fossils from the <em>Sahelanthropus</em> site that Daver and Guy’s team had tagged as neither hominid nor, more generally, as primate. She noted that one specimen — the leg bone — looked like it belonged to a primate, possibly an ape. Macchiarelli confirmed her observation. Plans for Bergeret-Medina to cut open the bone to study its mineral content were halted.</p>



<p>Macchiarelli informed his university and CNRS of the fossil’s identity. He spent the next 16 years, he says, sending repeated complaints to those institutions that the <em>Sahelanthropus</em> discoverers were violating codes of scientific conduct by not providing information about the leg bone in scientific papers or talks.</p>



<p>Then, CNRS launched an investigation of possible misconduct by Macchiarelli himself when the 2020 study appeared before the <em>Sahelanthropus</em> team published findings on the leg bone in its possession. No ruling has been made yet.</p>



<p>In supplementary information published with the new study, Guy and colleagues write that they identified the forearm bones among stored fossils after Macchiarelli brought the leg bone’s identity to their attention. Further excavations in Chad were conducted before launching a detailed study of the three limb fossils in 2017, the team says.</p>



<p>But the <em>Sahelanthropus</em> team does not cite Bergeret-Medina — now the curator of the Muséum d&#8217;Histoire Naturelle Jacques de La Comble in Autun, France — by name for her role in the leg bone’s identification. The investigators write that “a master’s student in taphonomy” received various fossils for a research internship in early 2004 before those finds had been carefully examined by senior scientists. The student, “seeking expertise,” gave the leg fossil to Macchiarelli who identified it as a hominid, Daver and colleagues say.</p>



<p>That’s incorrect, Macchiarelli contends. Bergeret-Medina initially identified the fossil as a primate’s upper leg bone followed by his confirmation of her observation. No claim was made that the fossil came from a hominid, he says. But without Bergeret-Medina’s insightful fossil observation, the new study would never have happened, Macchiarelli asserts. &nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-justify"><strong>Visualizing Genes: The Possible Dream</strong> <br>–&nbsp;<a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/visualizing-genes-possible-dream"><em>Science News</em></a>, September 2, 1972</p>



<p>Molecular biologists can now visualize the larger structures of the cell, such as the nucleus and chromosomes, under the powerful electron microscope. But they have not been able to obtain images of genes (DNA) on the chromosomes. Nor have they been able to see RNA … or the intricate details of cell membranes, enzymes and viruses.</p>



<h4>Update</h4>



<p>Electron m­icroscopes have become much more powerful over the last 50 years. For instance, in 1981, biophysicist Jacques D­ubochet discovered that tiny biological structures super­cooled with ethane could be observed in their natural state under an electron microscope. That finding paved the way for <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/chemistry-nobel-prize-goes-3-d-snapshots-lifes-atomic-details">cryo-electron micro­scopy</a>, which scientists use to visualize proteins, viruses and bacteria at the molecular level (<em>SN: 10/28/17, p. 6</em>). Capturing detailed images of genes remains elusive, but scientists are inching closer. In 2021, researchers reported using an electron microscope and the molecular scissors CRISPR/Cas9 to visualize proteins <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s42003-021-01752-8">transcribing DNA instructions</a> for two genes into RNA.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/sleep-deprivation-people-selfish-less-generous-brain-activity">Sleep deprivation may make people less generous</a></h4>

              
                <p>Lack of sleep has been linked to <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/restless-sleep-associated-heart-rhythm-problems">heart disease</a>, poor mood and loneliness (<em>SN: 11/15/16</em>). Being tired could also <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.3001733">make us less generous</a>, researchers report August 23 in <em>PLOS Biology.</em></p>



<p>The hour of sleep lost in the switch over to Daylight Savings Time every spring appears to reduce people’s tendency to help others, the researchers found in one of three experiments testing the link between sleep loss and generosity. Specifically, they showed that average donations to one U.S.-based nonprofit organization dropped by around 10 percent in the workweek after the time switch compared with four weeks before and after the change. In Arizona and Hawaii, states that do not observe Daylight Savings Time, donations remained unchanged. &nbsp;</p>





<p>With over half of the people living in parts of the developed world reporting that they rarely get enough sleep during the workweek, the finding has implications beyond the week we spring forward, the researchers say.</p>



<p>“Lack of sleep shapes the social experiences we have [and] the kinds of societies we live in,” says neuroscientist Eti Ben Simon of the University of California, Berkeley.</p>



<p>To test the link between sleep loss and generosity, Ben Simon and her team first brought 23 young adults into the lab for two nights. The participants slept through one night and stayed awake for another night.</p>



<p>In the mornings, participants completed a standardized altruism questionnaire rating their likelihood of helping strangers or acquaintances in various scenarios. For instance, participants rated on a scale from 1 to 5, with 1 for least likely to help and 5 for most likely, whether they would give up their seat on a bus to a stranger or offer a ride to a coworker in need. Participants never read the same scenario more than once. Roughly 80 percent of participants showed less likelihood of helping others when sleep-deprived than when rested.</p>



<p>The researchers then observed participants’ brain activity in a functional MRI machine, comparing each participant’s neural activity in a rested versus sleep-deprived state. That showed that sleep deprivation reduced activity in a network of brain regions linked to the ability to empathize with others.</p>



<p>In another experiment, the researchers recruited 136 participants online and had them keep a sleep log for four nights. Each participant then completed subsets of the altruism questionnaire before 1 p.m. the next day. The researchers found that the more time participants spent awake in bed, a measure of poor sleep, the lower their altruism scores. That drop in altruism held true both when comparing individuals to themselves and when averaging scores across the group.</p>



<p>In the final experiment focused on Daylight Savings Time, the researchers looked at charitable donations from 2001 to 2016 to Donors Choose, a nonprofit that raises money for school projects across the United States. When the team excluded Hawaii and Arizona, as well as outliers like very large donations, more than 3.4 million donations remained. In the workweek following the time change, total donations, which typically averaged roughly $82 per day, dropped to about $73 per day, Ben Simon says.</p>



<p>There’s always a possibility that some other variable besides sleep is causing this dip in generosity, says behavioral economist David Dickinson of Appalachian State University in Boone, N.C. But this “triple methodology approach” enabled the researchers to draw a convincing line from changes to the brain that appear during sleep deprivation to real-world behavior. “This puts a more comprehensive story on how inefficient sleep affects decisions in this domain of helping others,” he says. &nbsp;</p>



<p><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/sleep-recovery-weekend-health">Chronic sleep deprivation</a> in the modern world is a serious problem, Ben Simon says (<em>SN: 3/1/19</em>). But unlike many other large-scale problems — think climate change or political polarization — this one has a ready solution. “If you think about promoting sleep and letting people get the sleep they need, what an impact that could have on the societies we live in.”</p>

We&rsquo;re working with funders, policy makers, governments and institutional leaders, and we&rsquo;re advocating for Open Science at a local level. Through these relationships, we&rsquo;re helping to increase awareness and education around the benefits of Open Science, engage in Open Science policy, and build knowledge of issues and challenges that local communities face in Open Science adoption.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We always emphasize that Open Science relates not just to openness, but to rigor, reliability, robustness, and quality of research, and therefore its trustworthiness. By making the processes of scientific knowledge creation, evaluation and communication more transparent and making more artifacts of research and peer review public, Open Science invites discussion and feedback from a more diverse community earlier in the process. This contributes to high-quality, reproducible and reliable research, demonstrating the trust and integrity of the research, and of the researchers themselves</p>



<p>Key initiatives include our collaborations in Africa, including the <a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2022/03/advancing-open-science-in-africa-three-organizations-collaborate-to-increase-awareness-and-education/">African Association of Universities</a>, and the <a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2022/05/advancing-open-science-in-africa-three-organizations-collaborate-to-implement-open-science-principles-in-seven-partner-states/-organizations-collaborate-to-increase-awareness-and-education/">East African Commission for Science &amp; Technology</a> with our partners <a href="https://www.tcc-africa.org/">TCC Africa</a>, both looking to increase education and awareness around the benefits of Open Science with institutional leadership and national research councils and higher education commissions respectively. And we&rsquo;re delighted that global partners such as UNESCO have supported these initiatives as well.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Why do you think this is important for research?</strong></p>



<p>Science and research are and need to be global and collaborative endeavours if we are to solve the greatest challenges Society and humanity faces. Therefore we need to ensure that all who need to participate, can do so, and that no voices are excluded from the debate and conversation.</p>



<p>Our work with local communities and stakeholders aims to ensure that everyone can participate both in this scientific conversation and in an open future.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Open Science, when done well, should enable and facilitate global collaboration, and participation. By making opportunities to publish, peer review, and read accessible to everyone, Open Science at once enriches the scholarly literature, attracts more readers to published research, and maximizes the impact of that research. It democratises access and utility of knowledge, and allows more scholars to build upon the work to positively impact our future.</p>



<p><strong>What does it mean to you personally to be involved in work like this?</strong></p>



<p>Everything we do at PLOS aims to advance the adoption of Open Science for all the benefits it brings. Personally, it&rsquo;s important for me to work in an organisation whose values sync with my own and I am passionate about our mission to transform scholarly communication. Specifically, my role contributes to our goal to increase equitable participation in Open Science, which is fundamental to having a truly global and collaborative discussion about the challenges humanity and our planet faces. It&rsquo;s a privilege to be part of this, even in such a tiny way. If we can bring more people into this conversation, if we can enable them to participate where they would not have been able to before, then that would be wonderful.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>By the end of your career, what do you hope people will think about your contribution</strong></p>



<p>For me, it is less about my personal contribution, but more about the overall impact and achievement. I would love to see PLOS become the truly global publisher it is on the way to being, with true representation from across the globe embedded in shaping the unique contributions that PLOS makes towards that fully open, equitable future.&nbsp;</p>

              <h4><a href="https://gcamp6f.com/2022/08/23/self-supervised-denoising-of-calcium-imaging-data/">Self-supervised denoising of calcium imaging data</a></h4>

              
                <p>This blog post is about algorithms based on deep networks to denoise raw calcium imaging movies. More specifically, I will write about the difficulties to interprete their outputs, and on how to address these limitations in future work. I will also share my own experience with denoising calcium imaging data from astrocytes in mice.</p>



<p><strong>Introduction</strong></p>



<p>Averages from calcium imaging or representative movies in publications often look great. In reality, however,  two-photon calcium imaging is often limited primarily by low signal-to-noise ratios. There are many cases where recordings are dominated by shot noise to the extent that almost no structure is visible from a single frame. This can be due to a weakly expressing transgenic line; or on-purpose low expression levels to avoid calcium buffering; or it can be due to the fact that the microscope scans so fast across a large field of view or volume that it only picks up a few photons per neuron.</p>



<p><strong>The advent of new algorithms to denoise calcium imaging movies</strong></p>



<p>So, would it not be great to get rid of the noise in these noise-dominated movies using some magical deep learning algorithm? This seems to be the promise of a whole set of algorithms that were designed to denoise noisy images and recover the true signal using either supervised [1] but recently also self-supervised deep learning [2-3]. Recently, there have also been a few applications of these algorithms for calcium imaging [4-6]. The following tweet by Jérôme Lecoq was the first time I saw the results of such algorithms:</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<div class="embed-twitter"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Colleagues at <a href="https://twitter.com/AllenInstitute?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@AllenInstitute</a>, friends and my fellow neuroscientists, I just pushed a new paper which I believe is important to the field. We found a way to remove independent noise in systems neuroscience! <a href="https://t.co/gAxWJdc1OI">https://t.co/gAxWJdc1OI</a></p>&mdash; Jérôme Lecoq (@LecoqJerome) <a href="https://twitter.com/LecoqJerome/status/1317157955523862529?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 16, 2020</a></blockquote><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
</div></figure>



<p>The results look indeed very impressive. The implementations of these algorithms were subsequently published, by Lecoq et al. (DeepInterpolation) [4] and independently with a very similar approach by Li et al. (DeepCAD) [5]. Since then, a few follow-ups were published to compare performance among the two algorithms and also to improve performance of DeepCAD [6], or with ideas to apply supervised algorithms to denoise calcium imaging data [7].</p>



<p>Despite the great-looking results, I was a bit skeptical. Not because of a pratical but rather because of a theoretical concern: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/No_free_lunch_theorem">there is no free lunch</a>. Why should the output suddenly be less noisy than the input? How can the apparent information content increase? Let&#8217;s have a closer look at how the algorithm works to address this question.</p>



<p><strong>Taking into account additional information to improve pixel value estimates</strong></p>



<p>Let&#8217;s start very simple: Everybody will agree that the <em>measured </em>intensity for a pixel is a good estimate for the <em>true </em>fluorescence or calcium concentration at this location. However, we can refine our estimate very easily using some background information. What kind of background information? For example, if a high intensity value occurs in a region without any labeling, with all other time points of this pixel having almost zero value, we can be rather certain that this outlier is due to a falsely detected photon and not due to a true fluorescence signal. If however all surrounding pixels had high intensity values and the pixel of interest not, we could also correct our estimate of this pixel&#8217;s intensity value using (1) our experience about the spatial structures that we want to observe and (2) the information gained from the surround pixels. Therefore, refining our estimate of the pixel&#8217;s intensity is simply taking into account a prior what we expect the pixel&#8217;s intensity to be.</p>



<p>Methods based on self-supervised deep networks perform more or less such a procedure, and it is in my opinion a very reasonable way to obtain a better estimate for a pixel&#8217;s intensity. As a small difference, they only use the surrounding frames (adjacent in time) and not the pixel intensity itself (therefore lacking this Bayesian idea of improving an estimate using prior information). Despite this interesting small difference, it is clear that such denoising will &#8211; in principle &#8211; work. The network then uses deep learning to gain knowledge about what to expect in a given context; practically speaking, the prior knowledge will be contained in the network&#8217;s weights and extracted from a lot of raw data during learning. Using such a procedure, the estimate of the pixel&#8217;s intensity value will, probably under most conditions, be better than the raw intensity value.</p>



<p><strong>A side note:</strong> <strong>Computing the SNR from raw and denoised pixels</strong></p>



<p>From that, it is also clear that neighboring pixels of a denoised movie are correlated since their original values have influenced each other. It is therefore not justified to compare something like a SNR based on single pixels or single frames between raw and denoised data, because in one case (raw data) adjacent data points are truly independent measurements, while in the other (denoised data) they are not. Both DeepInterpolation [4] and DeepCAD [5] used such SNR measures that reflect the visual look and feel but are, in my opinion, not a good quantification of how much signal and how much noise is in the data. But this just as a side note.</p>



<p><strong>Denoising can make plausible point estimates that are however artifacts</strong></p>



<p>However, there is a remaining real problem. Let&#8217;s take some time to understand it. Clearly, the estimated intensity value is only a point estimate. So we don&#8217;t know anything about the confidence of the network to infer exactly this pixel intensity and not a different intensity value. Deep networks have been often shown to hallucinate familiar patterns when they were unconstrained by input. It is therefore not clear from looking at the results whether the network was very confident about all pixel intensities or whether it just made up something plausible because the input did not constrain the output sufficiently.</p>



<p>To make this rather vague concern a bit more concerete, here is an example of a calcium recording that I performed a few years ago (adult zebrafish forebrain, GCaMP6f). On the left side, you can see the full FOV, on the right side a zoom-in.<br />In the movie, there is first a version based on raw data, then the same raw data but with a smoothing temporal average, and finally a version denoised using the DeepInterpolation algorithm [4]. To provide optimal conditions, I did not use a default network provided by the authors but retrained it on the same data to which I applied the algorithm afterwards.</p>

<p>First, the apparent denoising is impressive, and it is easy to imagine that an algorithm performing automated source extraction will perform better for the denoised movie as for the raw movie.<br />When we look more carefully and with more patience, a few odd things pop out. In particular, the neuronal structures seem to &#8220;wobble around&#8221; a bit. Here is a short extract of a zoom-in into the denoised movie:</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-large is-resized"><img loading="lazy" data-attachment-id="7157" data-permalink="https://gcamp6f.com/2022/08/23/self-supervised-denoising-of-calcium-imaging-data/zoom_in/" data-orig-file="https://ptrrupprecht.files.wordpress.com/2022/08/zoom_in.gif" data-orig-size="60,53" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="zoom_in" data-image-description="" data-image-caption="" data-medium-file="https://ptrrupprecht.files.wordpress.com/2022/08/zoom_in.gif?w=60" data-large-file="https://ptrrupprecht.files.wordpress.com/2022/08/zoom_in.gif?w=60" src="https://ptrrupprecht.files.wordpress.com/2022/08/zoom_in.gif?w=60" alt="" class="wp-image-7157" width="413" height="365" /></figure></div>


<p>Neurons are densely packed in this region, such that the cytoplasms filled by GCaMP generate an almost hexagonal pattern when you slice through it with the imaging plane. In the excerpt above, there is indeed a sort of hexagonal pattern in each frame. However, the cell boundaries are shifting around from frame to frame. This shifting of boundaries can be particularly well seen for the cell boundary between the right-most neuron and its neighbor to the left. From the perspective of an intelligent human observer, these shifting boundaries are obviously wrong &#8211; it is clear that the brain and its neurons do not move.</p>



<p>So, what happened? The network indeed inferred some structural pattern from the noise, but it arrived at different conclusions for different time points. The network made the most likely guess for each timepoint given the (little) information it was provided, but the inconsistency of the morphological pattern shows that the network made up something plausible that however is partially wrong.</p>



<p><strong>Solution (1): Taking into account the overall time-averaged fluorescence </strong></p>



<p>To fix this problem specifically, the network could take into account not only surrounding pixels, but also the overall mean fluorescence (average across all movie frames) in order to make an educated guess about pixel intensity. As human observers, we do this automatically, and that&#8217;s why we can spot the artifact to start with. With the information about the overall anatomy, the network would have the same prior as the human observer and would be able to produce outputs that do not include such artifacts.</p>



<p><strong>Solution (2): Taking into account the uncertainty of point estimates</strong></p>



<p>However, the more general problem of the network to fill up uncertain situations with seemingly plausible but sometimes very wrong point estimates still persists. The only difference is that a human observer probably would be unable to identify the generated artifacts.</p>



<p>A real solution to the problem is to properly deal with uncertainties (for reference, here a <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.03342">review of uncertainty in deep networks</a>). This means that the network needs to be able to estimate not only the most likely intensity values for each pixel but also the confidence intervals for each value. With a confidence interval for each pixel value, one could compute the confidence interval for e.g. the time course of a neuron&#8217;s calcium ΔF/F averaged across an ROI. The computational problem here is that the error ranges for each pixel do not just add as independent errors, resulting in a standard error of the mean, since the values and confidence intervals for adjacent pixels are dependent on each other. I assume that a straight-forward analytical treatment might be too tricky and some sort of Monte Carlo-based simulation would work better here. This would make it possible to use the denoised movie to derive e.g. a temporal ΔF/F trace of a neuron together with an uncertainty corridor of the estimated trace.</p>



<p>To sum it up, at this point it seems that there is not only a need to develop tools that provide faster and more beautiful denoised images, but even more so procedures to properly deal with uncertainties of estimates that reflect an output that is not enough constrained by the input. Without such tools, analyses based on denoised data must be carefully inspected whether they might be susceptible to such artifacts.</p>



<p><strong>Practical aspects: Using denoising for astrocytic calcium imaging</strong></p>



<p>In a recent preprint [8], I used such methods (DeepInterpolation [4]) to denoise calcium recordings from hippocampal astrocytes. Astrocytes are rather sensitive to laser-induced heating, and I therefore applied low excitation power, resulting in relatively noisy raw recordings. One main goal of the study was to study not only ROIs drawn around somata but also the spatio-temporal calcium dynamics from somatic and distal compartments, ideally with a precision of a single pixel.</p>



<p>To be able to quantify such patterns, it was essential to denoise the raw movie (see Figure 6e and supplemental Figure S8 in [8]). Briefly, it worked really nicely:</p>



<figure class="wp-block-video wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-videopress"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<iframe title='VideoPress Video Player' aria-label='VideoPress Video Player' width='640' height='231' src='https://video.wordpress.com/embed/8gvx5GYL?cover=1&amp;preloadContent=metadata&amp;useAverageColor=1&amp;hd=1' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen data-resize-to-parent="true"  allow='clipboard-write'></iframe><script src='https://v0.wordpress.com/js/next/videopress-iframe.js?m=1658470809'></script>
</div></figure>



<p>It was however crucial to carefully look at both raw and denoised data to understand what was going on, and to consider potential artifacts with respect to downstream analyses. In my case, it helped that the central result of the paper, that <a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.08.16.504030v1.full#F6">calcium signals propagated from distal to proximal compartments under certain conditions</a>, was based on analyses averaged over time (due to the use of <a href="https://gcamp6f.com/2019/01/09/the-power-of-correlation-functions/">correlation functions</a>). Such averaging is likely to undo any harm introduced by small artifacts generated by denoising. In addition, I carefully looked at raw together with denoised data and thought about possible artifacts that might be introduced by denoising.</p>



<p>The second aspect to notice is that the algorithm was rather difficult to use, required a GPU with large memory and still then was very slow. This has improved a bit since then, but the hardware requirements are still high. An alternative algorithm [5] seems to have slightly lower requirements on hardware, and the authors of [5] also developed a modified version of their algorithm that seems to be much faster, at least for inference [6].</p>



<p><strong>Outlook</strong></p>



<p>The development of methods to denoise imaging data is a very interesting field, and I look forward to seeing more work in this direction. Specifically, I hope that the two possible developments mentioned above (taking into account the time-averaged fluorescence and dealing properly with uncertainty) will be properly explored by other groups.</p>



<p>Researchers who apply denoising techniques are themselves often very well aware of potential pitfalls and hallucinations generated by U-Nets or other related techniques. For example, Laine et al. [9] end their review of deep learning-based denoising techniques with this note of caution:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>&#8220;Therefore, we do not recommend, at this stage, performing intensity-based quantification on denoised images but rather to go back to the raw [images] as much as possible to avoid artefacts.&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>



<p>With &#8220;quantification&#8221;, they do not refer to the computation of ΔF/F but rather to studies that quantify e.g. localized protein expression in cells. But should the computation of ΔF/F values have less strict standards?</p>



<p>There are a few cases where potential problems and artifacts are immediately obvious for the application of denoising methods to calcium imaging data. Self-supervised denoising uses the raw data to learn the most likely intensity value given. As a consequence, there will be a tendency to suppress outliers. This is not bad by itself because such outliers are most likely just noise. But there might also be biologically relevant outliers: rare local calcium events on a small branch of a dendritic tree; or unusually shaped calcium events due to intracellularly recruited calcium; or unexpected decoupling of two adjacent neurons that are otherwise strongly coupled by electrical synapses. If the raw SNR is not high enough, the network will take such events as unlikely to be true and discard them in favor of something more normal.</p>



<p>As always, it is the experimenter who is responsible that such concerns are considered. To this end, some basic understanding of the available tools and their limitations is required. Hopefully this blog post helps to make a step into this direction!</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/kuiper-belt-discovery-solar-system-planets-space">The discovery of the Kuiper Belt revamped our view of the solar system</a></h4>

              
                <p class="has-drop-cap" style="font-size:20px">On a Hawaiian mountaintop in the summer of 1992, a pair of scientists spotted a pinprick of light inching through the constellation Pisces. That unassuming object — located over a billion kilometers beyond Neptune — would rewrite our understanding of the solar system.</p>



<p>Rather than an expanse of emptiness, there was something, a vast collection of things in fact, lurking beyond the orbits of the known planets.</p>



<p>The scientists had discovered the Kuiper Belt, a doughnut-shaped swath of frozen objects left over from the formation of the solar system.</p>





<p>As researchers learn more about the Kuiper Belt, the origin and evolution of our solar system is coming into clearer focus. Closeup glimpses of the Kuiper Belt’s frozen worlds have shed light on how planets, including our own, might have formed in the first place. And surveys of this region, which have collectively revealed thousands of such bodies, called Kuiper Belt objects, suggest that the early solar system was home to pinballing planets.</p>



<p>The humble object that kick-started it all is a chunk of ice and rock roughly 250 kilometers in diameter. It was first spotted 30 years ago this month.</p>





<h4>Staring into space</h4>



<p>In the late 1980s, planetary scientist David Jewitt and astronomer Jane Luu, both at MIT at the time, were several years into a curious quest. The duo had been using telescopes in Arizona to take images of patches of the night sky with no particular target in mind. “We were literally just staring off into space looking for something,” says Jewitt, now at UCLA.</p>



<p>An apparent mystery motivated the researchers: The inner solar system is relatively crowded with rocky planets, asteroids and comets, but there was seemingly not much out beyond the gas giant planets, besides small, icy Pluto. “Maybe there were things in the outer solar system,” says Luu, who now works at the University of Oslo and Boston University. “It seemed like a worthwhile thing to check out.”</p>

<p>Poring over glass photographic plates and digital images of the night sky, Jewitt and Luu looked for objects that moved extremely slowly, a telltale sign of their great distance from Earth. But the pair kept coming up empty. “Years went by, and we didn’t see anything,” Luu says. “There was no guarantee this was going to work out.”</p>



<p>The tide changed in 1992. On the night of August 30, Jewitt and Luu were using a University of Hawaii telescope on the Big Island. They were employing their usual technique for searching for distant objects: Take an image of the night sky, wait an hour or so, take another image of the same patch of sky, and repeat. An object in the outer reaches of the solar system would shift position ever so slightly from one image to the next, primarily because of the movement of Earth in its orbit. “If it’s a real object, it would move systematically at some predicted rate,” Luu says.</p>



<p>By 9:14 p.m. that evening, Jewitt and Luu had collected two images of the same bit of the constellation Pisces. The researchers displayed the images on the bulbous cathode-ray tube monitor of their computer, one after the other, and looked for anything that had moved. One object immediately stood out: A speck of light had shifted just a touch to the west.</p>



<p>But it was too early to celebrate. Spurious signals from high-energy particles zipping through space — <a href="https://imagine.gsfc.nasa.gov/science/toolbox/cosmic_rays1.html">cosmic rays</a> — appear in images of the night sky all of the time. The real test would be whether this speck showed up in more than two images, the researchers knew.</p>



<p>Jewitt and Luu nervously waited until 11 p.m. for the telescope’s camera to finish taking a third image. The same object was there, and it had moved a bit farther west. A fourth image, collected just after midnight, revealed the object had shifted position yet again. This is something real, Jewitt remembers thinking. “We were just blown away.”</p>

<p>Based on the object’s brightness and its leisurely pace — it would take nearly a month for it to march across the width of the full moon as seen from Earth — Jewitt and Luu did some quick calculations. This thing, whatever it was, was probably about 250 kilometers in diameter. That’s sizable, about one-tenth the width of Pluto. It was orbiting far beyond Neptune. And in all likelihood, it wasn’t alone.</p>



<p>Although Jewitt and Luu had been diligently combing the night sky for years, they had observed only a tiny fraction of it. There were possibly thousands more objects out there like this one just waiting to be found, the two concluded.</p>



<p>The realization that the outer solar system was probably teeming with undiscovered bodies was mind-blowing, Jewitt says. “We expanded the known volume of the solar system enormously.” The object that Jewitt and Luu had found, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/distant-object-hints-kuiper-belt">1992 QB1</a> (<em>SN: 9/26/92, p. 196</em>), introduced a whole new realm.</p>



<p>Just a few months later, Jewitt and Luu <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/images-hint-comet-reservoir-breakup">spotted a second object</a> also orbiting far beyond Neptune (<em>SN: 4/10/93, p. 231</em>). The floodgates opened soon after. “We found 40 or 50 in the next few years,” Jewitt says. As the digital detectors that astronomers used to capture images grew in size and sensitivity, researchers began uncovering droves of additional objects. “So many interesting worlds with interesting stories,” says Mike Brown, an astronomer at Caltech who studies Kuiper Belt objects.</p>



<p>Finding all of these frozen worlds, some orbiting even beyond Pluto, made sense in some ways, Jewitt and Luu realized. Pluto had always been an oddball; it’s a cosmic runt (smaller than Earth’s moon) and looks nothing like its gas giant neighbors. What’s more, its orbit takes it sweeping far above and below the orbits of the other planets. Maybe Pluto belonged not to the world of the planets but to the realm of whatever lay beyond, Jewitt and Luu hypothesized. “We suddenly understood why Pluto was such a weird planet,” Jewitt says. “It’s just one object, maybe the biggest, in a set of bodies that we just stumbled across.” Pluto probably wouldn’t be a member of the planet club much longer, the two predicted. Indeed, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/doggone-pluto-gets-planetary-demotion">by 2006, it was out</a> (<em>SN: 9/2/06, p. 149</em>).</p>



<h4>Up-close look</h4>



<p>The discovery of 1992 QB1 opened the world’s eyes to the <a href="https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/solar-system/kuiper-belt/overview/">Kuiper Belt</a>, named after <a href="https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/people/720/gerard-kuiper-1905-1973/">Dutch-American astronomer Gerard Kuiper</a>. In a twist of history, however, Kuiper predicted that this region of space would be empty. In the 1950s, he proposed that any occupants that might have once existed there would have been banished by gravity to even more distant reaches of the solar system.</p>



<p>In other words, Kuiper anti-predicted the existence of the Kuiper Belt. He turned out to be wrong.</p>



<p>Today, researchers know that the Kuiper Belt stretches from a distance of roughly 30 <a href="https://www.iau.org/public/themes/measuring/">astronomical units</a> from the sun — around the orbit of Neptune — to roughly 55 astronomical units. It resembles a puffed-up disk, Jewitt says. “Superficially, it looks like a fat doughnut.”</p>



<p>The frozen bodies that populate the Kuiper Belt are the remnants of the swirling maelstrom of gas and dust that birthed the sun and the planets. There’s “a bunch of stuff that’s left over that didn’t quite get built up into planets,” says astronomer Meredith MacGregor of the University of Colorado Boulder. When one of those cosmic leftovers gets kicked into the inner solar system by a gravitational shove from a planet like Neptune and approaches the sun, it turns into <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/space-rock-comet-centaur-astronomy">an object we recognize as a comet</a> (<em>SN: 9/12/20, p. 14</em>). Comets that circle the sun once only every 200 years or more typically derive from the solar system’s even more distant <a href="https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/solar-system/oort-cloud/overview/">repository of icy bodies known as the Oort cloud</a>.</p>

<p>In scientific parlance, the Kuiper Belt is a <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/tiny-dot-exomoon-evidence-exoplanet-moon-stars-astronomy">debris disk</a> (<em>SN Online: 7/28/21</em>). Distant solar systems contain debris disks, too, <a href="https://www.eso.org/public/images/potw1721a/">scientists have discovered</a>. “They’re absolutely directly analogous to our Kuiper Belt,” MacGregor says.</p>



<p>In 2015, scientists got their first close look at a Kuiper Belt object when NASA’s <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/mission-pluto-live-coverage">New Horizons spacecraft flew by Pluto</a> (<em>SN Online: 7/15/15</em>). The pictures that New Horizons returned in the following years were thousands of times more detailed than previous observations of Pluto and its moons. No longer just a few fuzzy pixels, the worlds were revealed as rich landscapes of<a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/ice-volcanoes-pluto-may-have-spewed-organic-rich-water"> ice-spewing volcanoes</a> and <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/first-global-maps-pluto-and-charon-show-highs-and-lows">deep, jagged canyons</a> (<em>SN: 6/22/19, p. 12</em>; <em>SN Online: 7/13/18</em>). “I’m just absolutely ecstatic with what we accomplished at Pluto,” says Marc Buie, an astronomer at the Southwest Research Institute in Boulder, Colo., and a member of the New Horizons team. “It could not possibly have gone any better.”</p>



<p>But New Horizons wasn’t finished with the Kuiper Belt. On New Year’s Day of 2019, when the spacecraft was almost 1.5 billion kilometers beyond Pluto’s orbit, it flew past another Kuiper Belt object. And what a surprise it was. Arrokoth — its name refers to <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/nasa-gave-ultima-thule-mu69-new-official-name-arrokoth">“sky” in the Powhatan/Algonquian language</a> — looks like <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/nasa-new-horizons-ultima-thule-mu69-pancakes">a pair of pancakes joined at the hip</a> (<em>SN: 12/21/19 &amp; 1/4/20, p. 5</em>; <em>SN: 3/16/19, p. 15</em>). Roughly 35 kilometers long from end to end, it was probably once two separate bodies that gently collided and stuck. Arrokoth’s bizarre structure sheds light on a fundamental question in astronomy: How do gas and dust clump together and grow into larger bodies?</p>



<p>One long-standing theory, called planetesimal accretion, says that a series of collisions is responsible. Tiny bits of material collide and stick together on repeat to build up larger and larger objects, says JJ Kavelaars, an astronomer at the University of Victoria and the National Research Council of Canada. But there’s a problem, Kavelaars says.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" width="680" height="510" src="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/082722_kuiper_inline-4.jpg" alt="Image of Arrokoth" class="wp-image-3116384" srcset="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/082722_kuiper_inline-4.jpg 680w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/082722_kuiper_inline-4-511x383.jpg 511w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/082722_kuiper_inline-4-600x450.jpg 600w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/082722_kuiper_inline-4-248x186.jpg 248w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/082722_kuiper_inline-4-263x197.jpg 263w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/082722_kuiper_inline-4-560x420.jpg 560w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><figcaption><span class="caption wp-caption-3116384">In 2019, New Horizons flew by Arrokoth (above), a roughly 35-kilometer-long Kuiper Belt object.</span><span class="credit wp-credit-3116384">NASA, JHU-APL, SWRI</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>As objects get large enough to exert a significant gravitational pull, they accelerate as they approach one another. “They hit each other too fast, and they don’t stick together,” he says. It would be unusual for a large object like Arrokoth, particularly with its two-lobed structure, to have formed from a sequence of collisions.</p>



<p>More likely, Arrokoth was born from a process known as gravitational instability, researchers now believe. In that scenario, a clump of material that happens to be denser than its surroundings grows by pulling in gas and dust. This process can form planets on timescales of thousands of years, rather than the millions of years required for planetesimal accretion. “The timescale for planet formation completely changes,” Kavelaars says.</p>



<p>If Arrokoth formed this way, other bodies in the solar system probably did too. That may mean that parts of the solar system formed much more rapidly than previously believed, says Buie, who discovered Arrokoth in 2014. “Already Arrokoth has rewritten the textbooks on how solar system formation works.”</p>



<p>What they’ve seen so far makes scientists even more eager to study another Kuiper Belt object up close. New Horizons is still making its way through the Kuiper Belt, but time is running out to identify a new object and orchestrate a rendezvous. The spacecraft, which is <a href="http://pluto.jhuapl.edu/">currently 53 astronomical units from the sun</a>, is approaching the Kuiper Belt’s outer edge. Several teams of astronomers are using telescopes around the world to search for new Kuiper Belt objects that would make a close pass to New Horizons. “We are definitely looking,” Buie says. “We would like nothing better than to fly by another object.”</p>



<h4>All eyes on the Kuiper Belt</h4>



<p>Astronomers are also getting a wide-angle view of the Kuiper Belt by surveying it with some of Earth’s largest telescopes. At the <a href="https://www.cfht.hawaii.edu/">Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope</a> on Mauna Kea — the same mountaintop where Jewitt and Luu spotted 1992 QB1 — astronomers recently wrapped up the <a href="http://www.ossos-survey.org/">Outer Solar System Origins Survey</a>. It recorded more than 800 previously unknown Kuiper Belt objects, bringing the total number known to roughly 3,000.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" width="1030" height="450" src="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/082722_kuiper_inline-5.jpg" alt="Photo of Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope" class="wp-image-3116385" srcset="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/082722_kuiper_inline-5.jpg 1030w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/082722_kuiper_inline-5-680x297.jpg 680w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/082722_kuiper_inline-5-800x350.jpg 800w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/082722_kuiper_inline-5-330x144.jpg 330w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/082722_kuiper_inline-5-768x336.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1030px) 100vw, 1030px" /><figcaption><span class="caption wp-caption-3116385">The Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope, near the summit of Mauna Kea on Hawaii’s Big Island, has revealed hundreds of Kuiper Belt objects.</span><span class="credit wp-credit-3116385">Gordon W. Myers/Wikimedia Commons (CC BY-SA 4.0)</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>This cataloging work is revealing tantalizing patterns in how these bodies move around the sun, MacGregor says. Rather than being uniformly distributed, the orbits of Kuiper Belt objects tend to be clustered in space. That’s a telltale sign that these bodies got a gravitational shove in the past, she says.</p>



<p>The cosmic bullies that did that shoving, most astronomers believe, were none other than the solar system’s gas giants. In the mid-2000s, scientists first proposed that planets like Neptune and Saturn probably <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/rock-rattle-and-roll">pinballed toward and away from the sun</a> early in the solar system’s history (<em>SN: 5/5/12, p. 24</em>). That movement explains the strikingly similar orbits of many Kuiper Belt objects, MacGregor says. “The giant planets stirred up all of the stuff in the outer part of the solar system.”</p>



<p>Refining the solar system’s early history requires observations of even more Kuiper Belt objects, says Meg Schwamb, an astronomer at Queen’s University Belfast in Northern Ireland. Researchers expect that a new astronomical survey, slated to begin next year, will find roughly 40,000 more Kuiper Belt objects. The <a href="https://www.lsst.org/">Vera C. Rubin Observatory</a>, being built in north-central Chile, will use its 3,200-megapixel camera to repeatedly photograph the entire Southern Hemisphere sky every few nights for 10 years. That undertaking, the Legacy Survey of Space and Time, or LSST, will revolutionize our understanding of how the early solar system evolved, says Schwamb, a cochair of the LSST Solar System Science Collaboration.</p>

<p>It’s exciting to think about what we might learn next from the Kuiper Belt, Jewitt says. The discoveries that lay ahead will be possible, in large part, because of advances in technology, he says. “One picture with one of the modern survey cameras is roughly a thousand pictures with our setup back in 1992.”</p>



<p>But even as we uncover more about this distant realm of the solar system, a bit of awe should always remain, Jewitt says. “It’s the largest piece of the solar system that we’ve yet observed.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/707587766/0/oupblogpsychology/">From navigation to architecture: how the brain interprets spaces and designs places</a></h4>

              
                <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://blog.oup.com/2022/08/from-navigation-to-architecture-how-the-brain-interprets-spaces-and-designs-places/"><img width="480" height="185" src="https://blog.oup.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/oxford-gab570d01b_1920-480x185.jpg" loading="lazy" link_thumbnail="1" /></a><p>How do our brains help us learn about the spatial relationships in our world and then use them to find our way from one place to another? And how might answering this question offer new insights into how architects design?</p><p>One possible answer to the first question came from the Nobel-prize winning discovery by John O&#8217;Keefe and his colleagues that linked navigation to the <em>hippocampus</em> of the rat brain. O’Keefe discovered neurons whose firing encoded where, in its small world, the animal found itself. More specifically, if the animal moved around a small box or simple maze, there were neurons—he called them <em>place cells</em>—that fired only when the animal was in a small region that he called the <em>place field</em> of the place cell.</p><div><figure><img loading="lazy" width="355" height="432" src="https://blog.oup.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Image-1.jpg" /><figcaption><em><sub>The “seahorse” cross section of hippocampus showing a schematization of core neural circuitry, as drawn by the Spanish neuroanatomist Santiago Ramon y Cajal (1899).</sub></em></figcaption></figure></div><p>But pause a moment. The word “place” can mean somewhat different things. In response to the question “Where did you meet Luigi?”, the natural answer would be, perhaps, “On the Belvedere of the Villa Cimbrone.” But place could also require detail like “30 meters from the left end of the Belvedere and 50 centimeters back from the balustrade.” So, going forward, let’s distinguish a significant or memorable place from a metrically defined place, and reserve the word <strong>place</strong> for the first usage and <strong>location</strong> for the second.</p><h2>Cognitive mapping and navigation</h2><p>Note that “knowing where you are” is very different from “being able to navigate.” A billboard on which there is an “x” with the legend “you are here” and is otherwise blank, is not a map. A map must encode all the places that matter to us and the paths we need to find a route from where we are to where we want to be, even if we have never before travelled between these two places. If the map is “in our head” we call it a&nbsp;<em>cognitive map</em>. The alternative to figuring out a path is simply to follow a route—whether a habitual route or one specified by a friend or smartphone.</p><p>In 1975-6, Israel Lieblich and I developed a computational account of how rats could find satisfactory paths through mazes depending on whether they were hungry, thirsty, or fearful. We modeled a cognitive map as a structure with nodes to represent significant places and with edges for the direct paths between them. We called this structure a <em>World Graph</em> (WG), but there are many such graphs at very different scales—whether encoding the places where food, water, or fearful stimuli can be found in a rat’s maze; the stations and connecting lines in a subway map; or the route maps of airlines that are indeed maps of the world—that <em>differ in what constitutes a significant place when employing the map</em>. Thus, we may have multiple WGs for the same territory.</p><div><figure><img loading="lazy" width="650" height="202" src="https://blog.oup.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Image-2.jpg" /><figcaption><em><sub>The Bridges of Königsberg problem: Is there a walk through the city that would cross each of its seven bridges (shown at Left) once and only once? (Right) The graph generated by Leonhard Euler (1736) as the basis for a general mathematical theorem which implies that no such walk exists. Each land area becomes a node, while each bridge becomes an edge.</sub></em></figcaption></figure></div><h2>Cognitive mapping and architectural design</h2><p>Just as a cognitive map is different from a set of fixed paths, so the cognitive scientist’s sense of&nbsp;<em>script</em>&nbsp;is very different from the script of a play, where who says what and when is prescribed in advance. Consider the “birthday party” script: the guests must bring presents, someone must prepare a cake with candles, and the candles must be lit before the birthday-honoree blows them out, etcetera. But whether the presents are opened before or after the cake ceremony, and what other activities are part of the party is not prespecified. Let’s just add that, when a party is held, the activities specified in the script require places in which they occur.&nbsp;</p><p>The implication for architecture is that a building is designed to serve multiple purposes and the architect must envisage how the building will support inhabitants in their performance of relevant scripts. The significant places for a building (or a city) are not only those where one can perform one’s own versions of the practical scripts that the architect has considered, but also those where one can appreciate a particular view, whether from the outside or within. Moreover, a building may succeed not only by satisfying the planned scripts—consider the highly scripted activities that distinguish schools, hospitals, and churches—but also by providing opportunities for users to explore.&nbsp;</p><p>This positive sense of exploration is what we might call&nbsp;<em>waylosing</em>:</p><blockquote><p>I am not advocating waylosing on the way to the maternity ward, but in less stressed situations it can be great fun. Waylosing is &#8230;  one of the great attractions of Venice &#8230; finding something unexpected and useful when looking for something else. (<a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://segd.org/wayshowing-and-waylosing-mollerup">Per Mollerup</a>, 21 April 2014.)</p></blockquote><p>I thought I had coined the word waylosing before I found this citation and had indeed applied it to the absolute delight of exploring Venice in a random way, far from the madding crowd in Piazza San Marco.</p><div><figure><img loading="lazy" width="413" height="616" src="https://blog.oup.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Image-3.jpg" /><figcaption><em><sub>Waylosing in Venice, 1957. (Author’s photo).</sub></em></figcaption></figure></div><h2>From scripts to cognitive maps to architecture</h2><p>All this led to a new perspective on architectural design, incorporating insights from brain imaging, neuropsychology, and computational modeling.</p><p>One challenge was to show how fragments of the architect’s memories can morph and combine in the design of forms that will afford new experiences to the future user. This required examining available studies of the role of the hippocampus in episodic memory (recalling past episodes, rather than contributing to a cognitive map) and how it also forms part of larger systems engaged in imagination.&nbsp;When we perform a script within a building, we are developing and exploiting cognitive maps to proceed from place to place within the satisfaction of that script, rather than simply seeking a path from start point to goal. In my book&nbsp;<em>When Brains Meet Buildings,&nbsp;</em>I thus analyzed what it means for the designer, imagining the experiences and behaviors of users of the forthcoming building, to in some sense “invert” the process whereby each user will form their own cognitive maps (note the plural) for the satisfaction of a range of scripts, and as the basis for forming new scripts for their own exploration and enjoyment of the building.</p><p>In sketching ideas for a building, the architect will develop ideas of the form, function, and feeling of the various spaces within and around it. The present discussion focuses on how ideas for different places envisaged to serve practical and aesthetic functions help define the places that will actually be constructed in and around the building. Ideas for these notional places must develop during the design process. These places may satisfy goals within diverse scripts—a focus on the feel of the kitchen might yield a script that demands a place for admiring the view of a garden, another for the meal-preparation script will demand a place to put the oven. At early stages of design, there will be multiple scripts, with each script having its own set of places that define the nodes of what we might call a script-WG. These specifications of the roles of inter-related places complement the architect’s sketches of the form of the building’s spaces, with limited specification of where and how the nodes will be linked to locations in the 3D Euclidean space defined around the site where the building will be constructed. Edges in a preliminary script-WG will simply mark transitions that will occur from one place to another in executing the corresponding script.&nbsp;</p><div><figure><img loading="lazy" width="650" height="432" src="https://blog.oup.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Image-4.jpg" /><figcaption><em><sub>Waylosing in Venice, 1957. (Author’s photo).</sub></em></figcaption></figure></div><p>All this leads to study of&nbsp;<em>melding diverse scripts</em>&nbsp;as a crucial process: a design that specifies separate places for each node of each script may be both uneconomical and inconvenient. For example, the scripts for food preparation and dishwashing in a home would normally involve using the same sink, whereas in a restaurant they might not.&nbsp;As design proceeds towards construction drawings, the various nodes must become anchored in that Euclidean space. This can include decisions to map certain nodes in distinct script-WGs to the same location, and this entails that the two script-WGs become merged into one as shared nodes inherit their properties and the edges of their progenitors. This in turn requires assessing whether features of one script do or do not block features of the other script as the new WG is refined to accommodate both scripts.&nbsp;The process of working this out may reflect back to modify the “what connects to what” of design at the WG level but also the aesthetics of form that marks the architect’s individual signature in shaping the building.</p><p>The implications of this work are to push understanding of architecture beyond the views offered by glossy photographs in magazines and on websites to engage with a deeper understanding of how people act and interact in the spaces that architects provide. This has implications for linking neuroscience (broadly conceived to include cognitive science and biology more generally) to a deeper understanding of human well-being. It also offers invitations to scientists to extend their studies from the laboratory to the built environment as the basis for fruitful conversations between architecture and neuroscience. To paraphrase John Fitzgerald Kennedy, “Ask not only what neuroscience can do for architecture, but also what architecture can do for neuroscience.”</p><Img align="left" border="0" height="1" width="1" style="border:0;float:left;margin:0;padding:0;width:1px!important;height:1px!important;" hspace="0" src="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/i/707587766/0/oupblogpsychology"><div style="clear:both;padding-top:0.2em;"><a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/2/707587766/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/fbshare20.png" style="border:0;margin:0;padding:0;"></a>&#160;<a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/28/707587766/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/fblike20.png" style="border:0;margin:0;padding:0;"></a>&#160;<a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/16/707587766/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/linkedin20.png" style="border:0;margin:0;padding:0;"></a>&#160;<a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/29/707587766/oupblogpsychology,https%3a%2f%2fblog.oup.com%2fwp-content%2fuploads%2f2022%2f08%2foxford-gab570d01b_1920-480x185.jpg"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/pinterest20.png" style="border:0;margin:0;padding:0;"></a>&#160;<a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/1/707587766/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/reddit20.png" style="border:0;margin:0;padding:0;"></a>&#160;<a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/24/707587766/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/twitter20.png" style="border:0;margin:0;padding:0;"></a>&#160;<a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/19/707587766/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/email20.png" style="border:0;margin:0;padding:0;"></a>&#160;<a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/20/707587766/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/rss20.png" style="border:0;margin:0;padding:0;"></a><h3 style="clear:left;padding-top:10px">Related Stories</h3><ul><li><a rel="NOFOLLOW" href="https://blog.oup.com/2022/08/monument-what-did-shakespeare-look-like/">Monument: what did Shakespeare look like?</a></li><li><a rel="NOFOLLOW" href="https://blog.oup.com/2022/08/has-russian-journalism-returned-to-soviet-era-restriction/">Has Russian journalism returned to Soviet era restrictions?</a></li><li><a rel="NOFOLLOW" href="https://blog.oup.com/2022/08/epiphanies-an-interview-with-sophie-grace-chappell/">Epiphanies: an interview with Sophie Grace Chappell</a></li></ul>&#160;</div>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/spider-bite-misinformation-news-errors">News stories have caught spiders in a web of misinformation</a></h4>

              
                <p>Even spiders, it seems, have fallen victim to misinformation.</p>



<p>Media reports about people&#8217;s encounters with spiders tend to be full of falsehoods with a distinctly negative spin. An analysis of a decade’s worth of newspaper stories from dozens of countries finds that <a href="https://www.cell.com/current-biology/fulltext/S0960-9822(22)01127-7">nearly half of the reports contain errors</a>, arachnologist Catherine Scott and colleagues report August 22 in <em>Current Biology</em>.</p>



<p>“The vast majority of the spider content out there is about them being scary and hurting people,” says Scott, of McGill University in Montreal. In reality, they note, “spiders almost never bite people.”</p>





<p>Of the roughly 50,000 known spider species, vanishingly few are dangerous. Instead, many spiders benefit us by eating insects like mosquitoes that are harmful to people. Even with the rare exceptions like brown recluse and black widow spiders, bites are extremely uncommon, Scott says. Some stories about bites blamed spiders that don’t occur in the area, and others reported symptoms that don’t match symptoms of actual bites. “So many stories about spider bites included no evidence whatsoever that there was any spider involved,” they say.</p>



<p>To conduct the study, Scott and their colleagues analyzed over 5,000 online newspaper stories about humans and spiders from 2010 to 2020 across 81 countries. In addition to errors, the team determined that 43 percent of the stories were sensationalized, often using words like <em>nasty, killer</em>, <em>agony</em> and <em>nightmare</em>. International and national newspapers were more likely to sensationalize spiders than regional outlets. Stories that included a spider expert were less sensationalistic, though there was no such effect from other experts, including doctors.</p>



<p>If people knew the truth about spiders, they could spend less time blaming them for bites and killing them with pesticides that are toxic to many other species, including humans, Scott says. Clearing up the misinformation would be good for spiders, too — especially the one in your house that doesn’t get squashed out of fear. Spiders in general stand to benefit, the researchers conclude, because news helps shape public opinion, which can influence decisions about wildlife conservation.</p>



<p>“Spiders are kind of unique in that they seem to be really good at capturing people&#8217;s attention,” says arachnologist Lisa Taylor at the University of Florida in Gainesville, who was not involved in the study. “If that attention is paired with real information about how fascinating they are, rather than sensationalistic misinformation, then I think spiders are well-suited to serve as tiny ambassadors for wildlife in general.”&nbsp;</p>

                <p>A study published in <em>PLOS Sustainability and Transformation </em>by Lindsay Jaacks at The University of Edinburgh, Midlothian, United Kingdom, Abhishek Jain at the Council on Energy, Environment and Water, New Delhi, India and colleagues suggests that while COVID-19 disrupted agricultural labor, supply chains, and farmers&rsquo; access to credit and markets, the pandemic did not significantly push Indian farmers to adopt more sustainable cultivation practices.

<p>India&rsquo;s agricultural system is largely based on input-intensive monocropping of staple crops. Nearly half of the population is employed in agricultural work, yet the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on agricultural practices have not been fully documented. In order to quantify changes in farmers&rsquo; cropping patterns and input use, and adoption of sustainable agricultural practices, researchers interviewed 3,637 farmers living in 20 Indian states and union territories by telephone between December 1, 2020 and January 10, 2021.</p>



<p><strong>Findings and Future Research</strong></p>



<p>The researchers found that 84% of farmers reported no change in the type of crops they grew, and 66% reported no change in fertilizer or pesticide use. The study has its limitations, however, including low response rates in several major agricultural states, as well as possible self-reporting bias. Further studies will be needed to better understand medium- and long-term changes in crop cultivation practices as well as the use of chemical inputs.</p>

<p>According to the authors, &ldquo;Contrary to our hypothesis, we did not find an association between COVID-19 and changes in crop cultivation patterns or interest in trying agroecological practices. However, although most farmers continued to grow the same crops with no change in input use, many expressed an interest in learning more about practicing more sustainable farming. These findings will inform future directions for resilient agri-food systems&rdquo;.</p>



<p>Jaacks adds, &ldquo;Despite disruptions to agri-food supply chains during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic in India, and about 1 in 5 farmers in our national sample reporting COVID-19 symptoms in the past month, the vast majority of farmers continued with prevailing cropping patterns. Rice remained the dominant crop in Kharif (monsoon season) of 2020, and the use of synthetic fertilizers and pesticides continued. Government support, peer-to-peer training networks, and market linkage support will be required to shift farmers to more nutrient-dense and sustainable cropping patterns.&rdquo;</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/two-asteroids-dinosaurs-impact-crater-nadir">Not one, but two asteroids might have slain the dinosaurs</a></h4>

              
                <p>Chicxulub, the asteroid that wiped out most dinosaurs, might have had a little sibling.</p>



<p>Off the coast of West Africa, hundreds of meters beneath the seafloor, scientists have identified what appears to be the remains of an <a href="http://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.abn3096">8.5-kilometer-wide impact crater</a>, which they’ve named Nadir. The team estimates that the crater formed roughly around the same time that another asteroid — <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/devastation-detectives-try-solve-dinosaur-disappearance">Chicxulub</a>, the dinosaur killer — slammed into modern day Mexico (<em>SN: 1/25/17</em>). If confirmed, it could mean that nonbird dinosaurs met their demise by a one-two punch of asteroids, researchers report in the Aug. 17 <em>Science Advances</em>.</p>





<p>“The idea that [Chicxulub] had help — for want of a better phrase — would have really added insult to serious injury,” says study coauthor Veronica Bray, a planetary scientist at the University of Arizona in Tucson.</p>



<p>Nearly <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/erosion-has-erased-most-earth-impact-craters-here-are-survivors">200 impact craters</a> have been discovered on Earth (<em>SN: 12/18/18</em>), the vast majority of which are on land. That’s because impact craters at sea gradually become buried under sediment, Bray says, which makes the Nadir structure a valuable scientific find, regardless of its birthdate.</p>



<p>Geologist Uisdean Nicholson of Heriot-Watt University in Edinburgh happened upon the structure while analyzing data collected by seismic waves transmitted underground to detect physical structures offshore of Guinea. Lurking beneath the seafloor — and under nearly 1 kilometer of water — he discerned a bowl-shaped structure with a broken-up, terraced floor and a pronounced central peak — features expected of a large impact.</p>



<p>Based on the structure’s dimensions, Bray, Nicholson and their colleagues calculate that, if an asteroid was responsible for the terrain, it would probably have been over 400 meters wide. What’s more, the researchers estimate that the impact would have rocked the ground like a magnitude 7 earthquake and stirred tsunamis hundreds of meters high.</p>



<p>Despite that fallout, the Nadir impact would have been far less devastating than the one from the roughly 10-kilometer-wide Chicxulub asteroid, says Michael Rampino, a geologist from New York University who was not involved in the study. “It certainly wouldn&#8217;t have had global effects,” he says.</p>



<p>Using geologic layers adjacent to Nadir, some with ages obtained by past studies, the team estimated the structure to have formed around the end of the Cretaceous period — 66 million years ago. The Nadir asteroid may even have formed a pair with the Chicxulub asteroid, the two having been ripped apart by gravitational forces during a previous Earth flyby, the researchers speculate.</p>

<p>But the study’s conclusions have some experts wary. “It looks like an impact crater, but it could also be something else,” says geologist Philippe Claeys of Vrije Universiteit Brussel in Belgium, who was not involved in the research. Confirming that the structure is an impact crater will require drilling for solid evidence, such as shocked quartz, he says. Alternative explanations for the structure’s identity include a collapsed volcanic caldera or a squeezed body of salt called a salt diapir.</p>



<p>The Nadir structure’s age is another uncertainty. The seismic data shows it appears to have formed sometime near the end the Cretaceous period&nbsp; or maybe a little later, Claeys says. “But that&#8217;s around the best they can say.” Drilling in the crater for minerals that contain radioactive elements could provide a more precise date of formation, Rampino says.</p>



<p>It’s not the first time that scientists have investigated whether Chicxulub had an accomplice. Some studies have suggested that the Boltysh crater in Ukraine <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1945-5100.2002.tb00875.x">may have formed at the same time as Chicxulub</a>, though researchers have since determined that Boltysh formed <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.abe6530">650,000 years later</a>.</p>



<p>Bray and her colleagues are currently negotiating for funding to collect samples from the crater, with aspirations to drill in 2024. That will hopefully settle some of the debate surrounding Nadir’s origins, Bray says, though new questions will probably arise too. “If we do prove that this is the sister of the dinosaur killer, then how many other siblings are there?”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/sea-urchin-skeletons-patterns-structure">Sea urchin skeletons’ splendid patterns may strengthen their structure</a></h4>

              
                <p>Sea urchin skeletons may owe some of their strength to a common geometric design.</p>



<p>Components of the skeletons of common sea urchins (<em>Paracentrotus lividus</em>) follow a similar pattern to that <a href="https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/full/10.1098/rsif.2022.0226">found in honeycombs</a> and dragonfly wings, researchers report in the August <em>Journal of the Royal Society Interface</em>. Studying this recurring natural order could inspire the creation of strong yet lightweight new materials.</p>



<p>Urchin skeletons display “an incredible diversity of structures at the microscale, varying from fully ordered to entirely chaotic,” says marine biologist and biomimetic consultant Valentina Perricone. These structures may help the animals maintain their shape when faced with predator attacks and environmental stresses.</p>



<p>While using a scanning electron microscope to study urchin skeleton tubercules — sites where the spines attach that withstand strong mechanical forces — Perricone spotted “a curious regularity.” Tubercules seem to follow a type of common natural order called a Voronoi pattern, she and her colleagues found.</p>

Perricone</span></figcaption></figure></div>


<p>Using math, a <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/how-math-helps-explain-delicate-patterns-dragonfly-wings">Voronoi pattern</a> is created by a process that divides a region into polygon-shaped cells that are built around points within them called seeds (<em>SN: 9/23/18</em>). The cells follow the nearest neighbor rule: Every spot inside a cell is nearer to that cell’s seed than to any other seed. Also, the boundary that separates two cells is equidistant from both their seeds.</p>



<p>A computer-generated Voronoi pattern had an 82 percent match with the pattern found in sea urchin skeletons. This arrangement, the team suspects, yields a strong yet lightweight skeletal structure. The pattern “can be interpreted as an evolutionary solution” that “optimizes the skeleton,” says Perricone, of the University of Campania “Luigi Vanvitelli” in Aversa, Italy.</p>



<p>Urchins, dragonflies and bees aren’t the only beneficiaries of Voronoi architecture. “We are developing a library of bioinspired, Voronoi-based structures” that could “serve as lightweight and resistant solutions” for materials design, Perricone says. These, she hopes, could inspire new developments in materials science, aerospace, architecture and construction.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/extreme-climate-reptile-evolution-permian-extinction">Extreme climate shifts long ago may have helped drive reptile evolution</a></h4>

              
                <p>There’s nothing like a big mass extinction to open up ecological niches and clear out the competition, accelerating evolution for some lucky survivors. Or is there? A new study suggests that the rate of climate change may play just as large a role in speeding up evolution.</p>



<p>The study focuses on reptile evolution across 57 million years — before, during and after <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/volcanic-eruptions-depleted-ocean-oxygen-may-have-set-great-dying">the mass extinction</a> at the end of the Permian Period (<em>SN: 12/6/18</em>)<em>.</em> That extinction event, triggered by carbon dioxide pumped into the atmosphere and oceans through increased volcanic activity about 252 million years ago, knocked out a whopping 86 percent of Earth’s species. Yet reptiles recovered from the chaos relatively well. Their exploding diversity of species around that time has been widely regarded as a result of their slithering into newly available niches.</p>





<p>But rapid climate fluctuations were already taking place much earlier in the Permian, and so were surges of reptile diversification, researchers say. Analyzing fossils from 125 reptile species shows that bursts of evolutionary diversity in reptiles <a href="http://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.abq1898">were tightly correlated with relatively rapid fluctuations in climate</a> throughout the Permian and millions of years into the next geologic period, the Triassic, researchers report August 19 in <em>Science Advances</em>.</p>



<p>Scientists’ understanding of evolution is expanding as they become more tuned into the connection between it and environmental change, says Jessica Whiteside, a geologist at the University of Southampton in England who works on mass extinctions but was not involved in the new work. “This study is bound to become an important part of that conversation.”</p>



<p>To investigate reptile evolution, evolutionary paleobiologist Tiago Simões of Harvard University and colleagues precisely measured and scanned reptile fossils ranging from 294 million to 237 million years old. In all, the researchers examined 1,000 specimens at 50 research institutions in 20 countries.  For climate data, the team used an <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-021-25019-2">existing large database of sea surface temperatures</a> based on oxygen isotope data, extending back 450 million years, published in 2021.</p>



<p>By closely tracking changes in body and head size and shape in so many species, paired with that climate data, the researchers found that the faster the rate of climate change, the faster reptiles evolved. The fastest rate of reptile diversification did not occur at the end-Permian extinction, the team found, but several million years later in the Triassic, when climate change was at its most rapid and global temperatures witheringly hot. Ocean surface temperatures during this time soared to 40° Celsius, or 104⁰ Fahrenheit — about the temperature of a hot tub, says Simões.</p>



<p>A few species did evolve less rapidly than their kin, Simões says. The difference? Size. For instance, reptiles with smaller body sizes are already preadapted to live in rapidly warming climates, he says. Due to their greater surface area to body ratio, “small-bodied reptiles can better exchange heat with their surrounding environment,” so stay relatively cooler than larger animals.</p>



<p>“The smaller reptiles were basically being forced by natural selection to stay the same, while during that same period of time, the large reptiles were being told by natural selection ‘You need to change right away or you’re going to go extinct,’” Simões says.</p>



<p>This phenomenon, called the Lilliput effect, is not a new proposal, Simões says, adding that it’s been well established in marine organisms. “But it’s the first time it’s been quantified&nbsp;in limbed vertebrates across this critical period in Earth&#8217;s history.”</p>



<p>Simões and colleagues’ detailed work has refined the complex evolutionary tree for reptiles and their ancestors. But, for now, it’s unclear which played a bigger role in reptile evolution long ago — all those open ecological niches after the end-Permian mass extinction, or the dramatic climate fluctuations outside of the extinction event.</p>



<p>“We cannot say which one was more important,” Simões says. “Without either one, the course of evolution in the Triassic and the rise of reptiles to global dominance in terrestrial ecosystems would have been quite different.”&nbsp;</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/covid-cdc-guidelines-back-to-school-masks-testing-coronavirus">The new CDC guidelines may make back-to-school harder</a></h4>

              
                <p>Across the United States, kids are prepping for back-to-school, or are already in classrooms, and parents are buckling up for another pandemic school year. Like me, many are trying to get a handle on what COVID-19 precautions to take. <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/media/releases/2022/p0811-covid-guidance.html">Updated guidance</a> released last week by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention hasn’t exactly helped. It may have made dealing with back-to-school more confusing — and could even spur new outbreaks.</p>



<p>Last November, my fifth grader had to quarantine at home for 10 days after a close contact tested positive. Now, the CDC has nixed the quarantine recommendation for people exposed to COVID-19. Today, our situation could look something like this: My COVID-exposed daughter would mask for 10 days, test on day five, and remain in school the whole time — only the infected child would isolate. That child would stay home for at least five days after a positive test. Then, if the child is fever-free and symptoms are improving, according to the new guidance, they could pop on a mask and hightail it back to class — no testing needed.</p>





<p>That advice could mean more COVID-19 in classrooms. Scientists have shown that <a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMc2202092?utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email#:~:text=Recently%2C%20the%20Centers%20for%20Disease,by%205%20days%20of%20masking.">people can remain infectious after day five</a>. So without testing for COVID-19, students and teachers won’t know if they’re bringing the disease back to school.&nbsp;</p>



<p>On the same day the CDC’s guidance came out, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration added yet another wrinkle. If you think you’ve been exposed to COVID-19 but test negative with an at-home COVID-19 antigen test, the FDA now recommends testing again … and again. Repeat testing over time cuts the chances <a href="https://www.fda.gov/medical-devices/safety-communications/home-covid-19-antigen-tests-take-steps-reduce-your-risk-false-negative-fda-safety-communication?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery">you’ll miss an infection and unknowingly spread the virus</a>, the FDA advised on August 11.</p>



<p>It’s hard to say how that advice jibes with the CDC’s new, more-relaxed guidelines. Even the agency has <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/08/17/us/politics/cdc-rochelle-walensky-covid.html">said its public guidance during the pandemic</a> has been “confusing and overwhelming,” the <em>New York Times</em> reports. CDC director Rochelle Walensky is now planning a shake-up that could include restructuring the communications office as well as <a href="https://www.npr.org/2022/08/17/1117904729/cdc-reorganization-walensky-covid">relying more on preliminary studies rather than waiting for research to go through peer-review</a>, according to NPR.</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Yesterday, the CDC released new COVID-19 guidelines. Now, some parents are wondering what that means for back-to-school. How do you feel about the changes?</p>&mdash; Science News (@ScienceNews) <a href="https://twitter.com/ScienceNews/status/1558104356821647363?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 12, 2022</a></blockquote><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<p>The CDC’s new guidance has sparked a range of reactions, many negative, among scientists, doctors, parents and teachers. In an informal <a href="https://twitter.com/ScienceNews/status/1558104356821647363?s=20&amp;t=r-37z-05BafAr-Cg5-dFvg">Twitter poll of <em>Science News</em> followers</a>, roughly 80 percent of the 353 respondents reported that the new CDC guidance made them feel confused, worried or angry and/or exasperated.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Now, it’s up to local school districts to decide what COVID-19 measures to take. “Just because guidance has changed <a href="https://www.nea.org/about-nea/media-center/press-releases/nea-presidents-statement-new-cdc-guidelines">does not mean COVID is gone</a>,” Becky Pringle, president of the National Education Association labor union, said in a statement. Not by a long shot. The United States is currently averaging nearly <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2021/us/covid-cases.html">500 daily coronavirus deaths</a> and more than <a href="https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#trends_dailycases_select_00">100,000 new cases a day</a>, an almost certain undercount.</p>



<p>As my own children gear up for school, I wonder about <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/covid-coronavirus-cdc-mask-guidelines-metrics-risk">COVID-19’s constantly shifting landscape</a>. Like other families with school-aged children, we’ve bounced from virtual school to in-person mask mandates to mask-optional recommendations. And we still don’t know our district’s plans for the upcoming year. School starts in about a week.</p>



<p>There is reason for hope, though: We know what measures can<a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coronavirus-covid-kids-school-return-parents-questions"> slow COVID-19’s spread </a>in schools. <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/school-mask-mandate-coronavirus-transmission-covid">Masking is a big one</a>. A preliminary study posted August 9 linked <a href="https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.08.09.22278385v1.full-text">lifting school mask mandates</a> in Boston-area K–12 schools with a rise in cases among students and staff. At Boston University, <a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2794964">mandatory masking plus a vaccine mandate</a> seemed to keep the virus in check in classrooms, scientists reported August 5 in <em>JAMA Network Open</em>. Testing can help, too. A computer analysis from England suggests that <a href="https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/full/10.1098/rsos.211985">regularly rapid testing students can curb classroom transmission</a>, scientists report August 10 in the <em>Royal Society Open Science</em>. </p>

<p>But knowing what works is not the same as actually employing evidence-based measures in the classroom, says Anne Sosin, a public health researcher at Dartmouth College whose research focuses on COVID-19 and rural health equity. She has studied how pandemic policies have impacted schools in northern New England. “I worry that we simply have not seen the political leadership to ensure that all children and educators can safely participate in school.”</p>



<p>I spoke with Sosin about the CDC’s new guidance, and what kids and parents might expect heading into the new school year. Our conversation has been edited for length and clarity.</p>



<p><strong><em>SN</em></strong><strong>: What do you think of the updated guidance?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Sosin: </strong>I was very disappointed that the CDC did not adopt a <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/covid-testing-school-works-coronavirus-pandemic-reopening">test-to-exit-isolation</a> recommendation.&nbsp;</p>



<p>What we’re going to see in schools are infected students and educators returning after five days still positive for COVID-19. Multiple studies have demonstrated that most people are infectious beyond five days. Not only is it highly likely that they’ll be seeding outbreaks. They’ll also be putting high-risk members of school communities in danger.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong><em>SN</em></strong><strong>: What could the guidance mean for vulnerable kids?&nbsp;</strong></p>



<p><strong>Sosin</strong>: I think that vulnerable people are going to be in a very precarious situation. The guidance mentions the need to ensure protections for immunocompromised and other high-risk people but there’s a problem of implementation. Will schools actually implement those protections?</p>



<p><strong><em>SN</em></strong><strong>: Do scientists have a good handle on what protections can help?&nbsp;</strong></p>



<p><strong>Sosin</strong>: Definitely. We have really strong evidence showing that when layered mitigation strategies are in place, we can almost eliminate transmission in school settings. That means that we should have upgraded ventilation, lunchroom strategies [like taking kids outside to eat] and testing. And I continue to think that data-driven mask policies have a role to play. Not masking forever, but masking at times when we see an uptick in transmission.</p>



<p><strong><em>SN:</em></strong><strong> How could the new guidance affect different communities across the United States?&nbsp;</strong></p>



<p><strong>Sosin</strong>: Different communities have not only been <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/covid-data/investigations-discovery/hospitalization-death-by-race-ethnicity.html">impacted in dramatically different ways</a>, but they’re also on unequal footing at this stage of the pandemic.</p>



<p>[If we compare white communities with communities of color], we see disparities in vaccination coverage and caregiver loss. Some communities have suffered enormous losses while others have really been untouched. <a href="https://publications.aap.org/pediatrics/article/148/6/e2021053760/183446/COVID-19-Associated-Orphanhood-and-Caregiver-Death">Black children have lost caregivers</a> at more than two times the rate of white children. For Indigenous children, the rate is 4.5 times as high. Those are sharp disparities.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Communities of color also have less access to testing, treatment and health care. I worry that if we don’t have a renewed focus on equity, then we’re just going to see an exacerbation of disparities that have existed throughout the pandemic.</p>



<p><strong><em>SN</em>: What advice do you have for parents as they head into the new school year?&nbsp;</strong></p>



<p><strong>Sosin</strong>: We all want as normal a school year as possible. Masking should be one of the tools we’re ready to employ to keep our kids in the classroom. In addition, we should be advocating that our schools invest in ventilation. Vaccination also represents a critical piece of the strategy.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We see such abysmal vaccination coverage among children. <a href="https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#vaccinations_vacc-people-additional-dose-totalpop">Less than 1 in 3 kids ages 5 to 11 are fully vaccinated</a>. I think many parents no longer see it as important — there’s been this narrative that the pandemic is over. We need clear messaging that vaccination remains an important tool.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Now is a great time to plan back-to-school campaigns to vaccinate kids and to begin to prepare for the arrival of omicron-specific boosters in the fall.</p>

<p><a href="https://bookshop.org/a/21798/9780691197579">The Five-Million-Year Odyssey<br></a><em>Peter Bellwood<br>Princeton Univ., $29.95</em></p>



<p>Archaeologist Peter Bellwood’s academic odyssey wended from England to teaching posts halfway around the world, first in New Zealand and then in Australia. For more than 50 years, he has studied how humans settled islands from Southeast Asia to Polynesia.</p>



<p>So it’s fitting that his new book, a plain-English summary of what’s known and what’s not about the evolution of humans and our ancestors, emphasizes movement. In <em>The</em> <em>Five-Million-Year Odyssey</em>, Bellwood examines a parade of species in the human evolutionary family — he collectively refers to them as <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/human-evolution-species-origin-fossils-ancient-dna">hominins, whereas some others (including <em>Science News</em>) use the term hominids</a> (<em>SN: 9/15/21</em>) — and tracks their migrations across land and sea. He marshals evidence indicating that hominids in motion continually shifted the direction of biological and cultural evolution.</p>





<p>Throughout his tour, Bellwood presents his own take on contested topics. But when available evidence leaves a debate unresolved, he says so. Consider the earliest hominids. Species from at least 4.4 million years ago or more whose hominid status is controversial, such as <em>Ardipithecus ramidus</em>, get a brief mention. Bellwood renders no verdict on whether those finds come from early hominids or ancient apes. He focuses instead on African australopithecines, a set of upright but partly apelike species thought to have included populations that evolved into members of our own genus, <em>Homo</em>, around 2.5 million to 3 million years ago. Bellwood hammers home the point that stone-tool making by the last australopithecines, the first <em>Homo</em> groups or both contributed to the evolution of bigger brains in our ancestors.</p>



<p>The action speeds up when <em>Homo erectus </em>becomes the first known hominid to leave Africa, roughly 2 million years ago. Questions remain, Bellwood writes, about how many such migrations occurred and whether this humanlike species reached distant islands such as Flores in Indonesia, perhaps giving rise to <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/hobbits-died-out-earlier-thought">small hominids called hobbits, or <em>Homo floresiensis</em></a> (<em>SN: 3/30/16</em>). What’s clear is that <em>H. erectus </em>groups journeyed across mainland Asia and at least as far as the Indonesian island of Java.</p>



<p>Intercontinental migrations flourished after <em>Homo sapiens</em> debuted, around 300,000 years ago in Africa. Bellwood regards <em>H. sapiens</em>, Neandertals and Denisovans as distinct species that interbred in certain parts of Asia and Europe. He suggests that Neandertals disappeared around 40,000 years ago as they mated with members of more numerous <em>H. sapiens</em> populations, leaving a genetic legacy in people today. But he does not address an opposing argument that different <em>Homo</em> populations at this time, including Neandertals, were too closely related to have been separate species and that it was<a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/dragon-man-skull-homo-longi-human-evolution-neandertals"> intermittent mating among these mobile groups</a> that drove the evolution of present-day humans (<em>SN: 6/5/21</em>).</p>



<p>Bellwood gives considerable attention to the rise of food production and domestication in Europe and Asia after around 9,000 years ago. He builds on an argument, derived from his 2004 book <em>First Farmers</em>, that expanding populations of early cultivators migrated to new lands in such great numbers that they spread major language families with them. For instance, farmers in what’s now Turkey spread Indo-European languages into much of Europe sometime after roughly 8,000 years ago, Bellwood contends.</p>



<p>He rejects a recent alternative proposal, based on ancient DNA evidence, that <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/how-asian-nomadic-herders-built-new-bronze-age-cultures">horse-riding herders of Central Asia’s Yamnaya</a> culture brought their traditions and Indo-European tongues to Europe around 5,000 years ago (<em>SN: 11/15/17</em>). Too few Yamnaya immigrated to impose a new language on European communities, Bellwood says. Similarly, he argues, ancient Eurasian conquerors, from Alexander the Great to Roman emperors, couldn’t get speakers of regional languages to adopt new ones spoken by their outnumbered military masters.</p>



<p>Bellwood rounds out his evolutionary odyssey with a reconstruction of how early agricultural populations expanded through East Asia and beyond, to Australia, a string of Pacific islands and the Americas. Between about 4,000 and 750 years ago, for instance, sea-faring farmers spread Austronesian languages from southern China and Taiwan to Madagascar in the west and Polynesia in the east. Precisely how they accomplished that remarkable feat remains a puzzle.</p>



<p>Disappointingly, Bellwood doesn’t weigh in on a recent archaeological argument that <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/human-history-society-dawn-of-everything-book">ancient societies were more flexible and complex than long assumed</a> (<em>SN: 11/9/21</em>). On the plus side, his evolutionary odyssey moves along at a brisk pace and, like our ancestors, covers a lot of ground.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The overall winner captures something like out of science fiction &#8211; the fruiting body of a parasitic fungus erupting from the body of a fly. Roberto García-Roa, an evolutionary biologist and conservation photographer affiliated with the University of Valencia (Spain) and Lund University (Sweden), captured this unsettling image in the Peruvian jungle of Tambopata. Roberto explains that “spores of the so-called ‘Zombie’ fungus (e.g. genera </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">Ophiocordyceps</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400">) infect arthropods by infiltrating their exoskeleton and minds. As a result, parasitized hosts are compelled to migrate to a more favourable location for the fungus’s growth. Here, they await death, at which point the fungus feeds on its host to produce fruiting bodies full of spores that will be jettisoned to infect more victims &#8211; a conquest shaped by thousands of years of evolution.” Senior Editorial Board Member Christy Anna Hipsley comments that this image depicting a parasite-host interaction “has a depth and composition that conveys life and death simultaneously &#8211; an affair that transcends time, space, and even species.

<p>Alwin Hardenbol from the University of Eastern Finland, Finland took the winning image for the Relationships in Nature category. The photograph depicts a Bohemian Waxwing feasting on fermented rowan berries, demonstrating the strong relationship between the species. The presence of rowan berries influences the migration of waxwings, which can eat several hundred berries per day and have evolved larger livers in order to process ethanol produced by fermenting berries.</p>

<p>The Biodiversity Under Threat category winner was captured by Samantha Kreling from the University of Washington, USA, and shows African elephants sheltering from the Sun under a large baobab tree in Mapungubwe National Park, South Africa as droughts strike. Samantha Kreling said: “Baobab trees can live for more than 2,000 years and store water in their barrel-like trunks when water is scarce. The tree in this image has had its bark stripped by elephants seeking water. Although these trees are usually fast-healing, this damage is more than baobab trees can cope with as temperatures rise due to climate change. This photograph highlights the need for action to prevent the permanent loss of these iconic trees.”</p>

A false spring &#8211; climate change threatens wood frog offspring. Attribution: Lindsey Swierk.</div><div class="attachment-image--source"></div></figcaption></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Lindsey Swierk, an Assistant Research Professor at Binghamton University (State University of New York), submitted the runner-up for this category. Spring in the northeastern United States is arriving earlier and becoming more variable in temperature. This change poses a threat to many spring-breeding amphibians, including wood frogs. Lindsey explains, &#8220;Wood frogs (</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">Rana sylvatica</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400">) are early spring breeders in temperate North America. Lately, wood frogs are breeding earlier in the year as climate change unseasonably warms early spring in the Northeastern USA. Unfortunately, winter storms can still catch frogs unexpectedly and trap them under the ice. Here, a male wood frog clings to an egg mass produced before a freeze; both the egg mass and the frog were recently trapped under ice. The frog survived, but many of the eggs did not.&#8221; Senior Editorial Board Member Josef Settele comments, &#8220;I think it is important to realise that effects of major drivers of biodiversity change can also happen in counter-intuitive ways. In the present case, due to climate warming, there is an increased risk of the frog offspring dying because of cold/freezing (due to severe changes in phenology).&#8221;</span></p>

Brandon André Güell said: “The eggs in this image were laid by thousands of gliding treefrogs during an explosive breeding event triggered by a torrential rainstorm. If undisturbed, these eggs will hatch after six days of development, however the embryos can hatch early in order to escape threats such as predators and flooding.”</p>

They can spend almost 20 minutes underwater, inhaling and exhaling a bubble of air that clings to their snout. Oxygen from this bubble is depleted over the underwater dive, which likely helps water anoles remain underwater for so long.”</span></p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/zombie-fungus-body-fly-photo-contest">An award-winning photo captures a ‘zombie’ fungus erupting from a fly</a></h4>

              
                <p>Sometimes a photo is literally a matter of life, death — and zombies.</p>



<p>This haunting image, winner of the 2022 <em>BMC Ecology and Evolution</em> photography competition, certainly fits that description. It captures the fruiting bodies of a parasitic fungus, emerging from the lifeless body of an infected fly in the Peruvian rainforest.</p>



<p>The fungus-infested fly was one of many images submitted to the contest from all over the world, aiming to showcase the beauty of the natural world and the challenges it faces. The journal <a href="https://www.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12862-022-02049-y">revealed the winners</a> August 18.</p>





<p>Roberto García-Roa, a conservation photographer and evolutionary biologist at the University of Valencia in Spain, took the winning photo while visiting the Tambopata National Reserve, a protected habitat in the Amazon.</p>



<p>The fungus erupting from the fly belongs to the genus <em>Ophiocordyceps, </em>a diverse collection of parasitic fungi known as “zombie fungi,” due to their <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/deadly-fungus-gives-zombie-ants-lockjaw">ability to infect insects and control their minds</a> (<em>SN: 7/17/19</em>).</p>



<p>“There is still much to unravel about the diversity of these fungi as it is likely that each insect species infected succumbs to its own, specialized fungus,” says Charissa de Bekker, an expert in parasitic fungi at Utrecht University in the Netherlands.</p>



<p>First, spores of the fungus land on the ill-fated fly. So begins the manipulative endgame. The spores infiltrate the fly’s exoskeleton before infecting its body and eventually hijacking its mind. Once in control, the fungus uses its new powers of locomotion to relocate to a microclimate more suitable to its own growth — somewhere with the right temperature, light and moisture.</p>



<p>Fungus and fly then bide their time until the fly dies, becoming a food source for the fungus to consume. Fruiting bodies work their way out of the fly, filled with spores that are released into the air to continue the macabre cycle in a new, unsuspecting host. It is a “conquest shaped by thousands of years of evolution,” García-Roa said in a statement announcing the winners.</p>



<p>Research into the molecular aspects of fungal mind control is under way, De Bekker says, including in her own lab. “These fungi harbor all sorts of bioactive chemicals that we have yet to characterize and that could have novel medicinal and pest control applications.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/pfas-forever-chemicals-degrade-lye-chemistry">Common, cheap ingredients can break down some ‘forever chemicals’</a></h4>

              
                <p>There’s a new way to rip apart harmful “forever chemicals,” scientists say.</p>



<p>Perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances, also known as PFAS, are found in nonstick pans, water-repellent fabrics and <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/pfas-chemicals-biodegradable-food-containers-compost">food packaging</a> and they are pervasive throughout the environment. They’re nicknamed forever chemicals for their ability to stick around and not break down. In part, that’s because PFAS have a super strong bond between their carbon and fluorine atoms (<em>SN: 6/4/19</em>). Now, using a bit of heat and two relatively common compounds, researchers have <a href="http://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.abm8868">degraded one major type of forever chemical in the lab</a>, the team reports in the Aug. 19 <em>Science.</em> The work could help pave the way for a process for breaking down certain forever chemicals commercially, for instance by treating wastewater.</p>





<p>“The fundamental knowledge of how the materials degrade is the single most important thing coming out of this study,” organic chemist William Dichtel said in an August 16 news conference.</p>



<p>While some scientists have found relatively simple ways of <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/pfas-forever-chemicals-uv-iodide-perfluoroalkyl-polyfluoroalkyl-sulfite">breaking down select PFAS</a>, most degradation methods require harsh, energy-intensive processes using intense pressure — in some cases over 22 megapascals — or extremely high temperatures — sometimes upwards of 1000⁰ Celsius — to break the chemical bonds<em> (SN: 6/3/22)</em>.</p>



<p>Dichtel, of Northwestern University in Evanston, Ill., and his team experimented with two substances found in nearly every chemistry lab cabinet: sodium hydroxide, also known as lye, and a solvent called dimethyl sulfoxide, or DMSO. The team worked specifically with a group of forever chemicals called PFCAs, which contain carboxylic acid and constitute a large percentage of all PFAS. Some of these&nbsp;kinds of forever chemicals are found in water-resistant clothes.</p>



<p>When the team combined PFCAs with the lye and DMSO at 120⁰ C and with no extra pressure needed, the carboxylic acid fell off the chemical and became carbon dioxide in a process called decarboxylation. What happened next was unexpected, Dichtel said. Loss of the acid led to a process causing “the entire molecule to fall apart in a cascade of complex reactions.&#8221; This cascade involved steps that degraded the rest of the chemical into fluoride ions and smaller carbon-containing products, leaving behind virtually no harmful by-products.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; .</p>



<p>“It’s a neat method, it’s different from other ones that have been tried,” says Chris Sales, an environmental engineer at Drexel University in Philadelphia who was not involved in the study. “The biggest question is, how could this be adapted and scaled up?” Northwestern has filed a provisional patent on behalf of the researchers.</p>



<p>Understanding this mechanism is just one step in undoing forever chemicals, Dichtel’s team said. And more research is needed: There are other classes of PFAS that require their own solutions. This process wouldn&#8217;t work to tackle PFAS out in the environment, because it requires a concentrated amount of the chemicals. But it could one day be used in wastewater treatment plants, where the pollutants could be filtered out of the water, concentrated and then broken down.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/mosquito-smell-humans-odor-aedes-aegypti">Why mosquitoes are especially good at smelling you</a></h4>

              
                <p>Some mosquitoes have a near-foolproof thirst for human blood. Previous attempts to prevent the insects from tracking people down by blocking part of mosquitoes’ ability to smell have failed. A new study hints it’s because the bloodsuckers have built-in workarounds to ensure they can always smell us.</p>



<p>For most animals, individual nerve cells in the olfactory system can detect just one type of odor. But <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2022.07.024"><em>Aedes aegypti</em> mosquitoes’ nerve cells can each detect many</a> smells, researchers report August 18 in <em>Cell</em>. That means if a cell were to lose the ability to detect one human odor, it still can pick up on other scents.</p>





<p>The study provides the most detailed map yet of a mosquito’s sense of smell and suggests that concealing human aromas from the insects could be more complicated than researchers thought.</p>



<p>Repellents that block mosquitoes from detecting human-associated scents could be especially tricky to make. “Maybe instead of trying to mask them from finding us, it would be better to find odorants that mosquitoes don’t like to smell,” says Anandasankar Ray, a neuroscientist at the University of California, Riverside who was not involved in the work. Such repellents may <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/science-gets-deets-deet">confuse</a> or <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/how-catnip-plant-repels-insects-mosquitoes-chemical-receptor">irritate</a> the bloodsuckers and send them flying away (<em>SN: 9/21/11; SN: 3/4/21</em>).</p>



<p>Effective repellents are a key tool to prevent mosquitoes from transmitting disease-causing viruses such as <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/scent-zika-dengue-infection-mosquito-lure-acetophenone">dengue and Zika</a> (<em>SN: 7/11/22</em>). “Mosquitoes are responsible for more human deaths than any other creature,” says Olivia Goldman, a neurobiologist at Rockefeller University in New York City. “The better we understand them, the better that we can have these interventions.” &nbsp;</p>



<p>Mosquitoes that feed on people home in on a variety of cues when hunting, including body heat and body odor. The insects smell using their antennae and small appendages close to the mouth. Using three types of sensors in olfactory nerve cells, they can detect chemicals such as <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/good-luck-outsmarting-mosquito">carbon dioxide</a> from exhaled breath or components of body odor (<em>SN: 7/16/15</em>). </p>



<p>In previous work, researchers thought that blocking some sensors might <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/blog/science-ticker/targeting-single-set-nerve-cells-may-block-mosquitoes">hide human scents</a> from mosquitoes by disrupting the smell messages sent to the brain (<em>SN: 12/5/13</em>). But even those sensor-deprived mosquitoes can still smell and bite people, says neurobiologist Margo Herre also of Rockefeller University.</p>



<p>So Goldman, Herre and colleagues added fluorescent labels to <em>A. aegypti </em>nerve cells, or neurons, to learn new details about how the mosquito brain deciphers human odors. Surprisingly, rather than finding the typical single type of sensor per nerve cell, the team found that individual mosquito neurons appear more like sensory hubs.</p>



<p>Genetic analyses confirmed that some of the olfactory nerve cells had more than one type of sensor. Some cells produced electrical signals in response to several mosquito-attracting chemicals found in humans such as octenol and triethyl amine — a sign the neurons could detect more than one type of odor molecule. A separate study published in April in <em>eLife</em> found <a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/72599">&nbsp;similar results in fruit flies</a>, which suggests such a system may be common among insects.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s unclear why having redundant ways of detecting people’s odors might be useful to mosquitoes. “Different people can smell very different from one another,” says study coauthor Meg Younger, a neurobiologist at Boston University. “Maybe this is a setup to find a human regardless of what variety of human body odor that human is emitting.”</p>

<p><strong>During your time at PLOS, what initiative/s have you been involved with that aim to create lasting change in the ways science is communicated</strong>?</p>



<p>In my time at PLOS, I&rsquo;ve had the privilege of launching several new business models &mdash; <a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2022/03/open-access-doesnt-need-apcs-part-iii-flat-fees/">Flat Fees</a>, <a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2022/01/open-access-doesnt-need-apcs-part-1/">Community Action Publishing</a>, and <a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2022/02/open-access-doesnt-need-apcs-part-ii-global-equity/">Global Equity</a> &mdash; that enable more authors to publish open access and engage with open science best practice without paying fees. These models reduce the &ldquo;barrier to entry&rdquo; for researchers from many different backgrounds who do not have the funds to pay APCs. And essentially prove that there is more than one way to cover the cost of Open Access publishing.</p>



<p>To&nbsp; echo what George and Emily have mentioned in their <a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2022/08/what-drives-us-ensuring-fair-opportunities-for-all-authors/">post</a>, I think we create more/better science when as many voices as possible can participate &mdash; at the level and the moment that&rsquo;s appropriate for them. Open Access created more opportunities for more people to interact with science when and how it&rsquo;s most meaningful to them. A secondary school teacher interested in new methodologies to support students with special needs in the classroom has a very different level of expertise/accessibility to research than a PhD student. Open Access levels that playing field. But we still need more creative solutions to ensure every <em>author </em>can make their work open if they choose, which is what these models aim to do.</p>



<p><strong>Why do you think this is important for science?</strong></p>



<p>It&rsquo;s important because science is a global, interdisciplinary enterprise. We risk losing vital voices when structural barriers &mdash; like cost &mdash; prevent a researcher from participating in that enterprise. Though we still have a lot of work ahead of us&ndash;much more to improve and to learn about how we can create solutions that work for all authors&ndash;this is a first step in thinking about Open Access differently. These models are leading the way in opening our own PLOS journals to all authors, as well as pushing other publishers &mdash; and academic institutions more broadly&ndash; to think more expansively about what it means to further inclusion in scholarly communication.</p>



<p><strong>What does it mean to you personally to be involved in work like this?</strong></p>



<p>Researchers dedicate their lives and livelihood to doing important work in their communities. If our work to make Open Access publishing more inclusive makes it possible for even <em>one </em>more voice to be heard, amplified, and shared, our work is a success. But we can and mustdo better than just one. PLOS is a global publisher, with a growing portfolio of journals that reach all areas of science and medicine. We have the capacity to make bold changes that reverberate across the scholarly community and lead by example. To be at the forefront of this work and see the pressure it puts on our peers across the industry to make lasting change is extremely gratifying. I&rsquo;m very lucky to part of it.</p>



<p><strong>By the end of your career, what do you hope people will think about your contribution</strong>?</p>



<p>In short, that it changed the way scholarly communication looked at the economics of authorship and participation.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/oort-cloud-comets-spin-death">Oort cloud comets may spin themselves to death</a></h4>

              
                <p>Comets from the solar system’s deep freezer often don’t survive their first encounter with the sun. Now one scientist thinks he knows why: Solar warmth makes some of the cosmic snowballs spin so fast, they fall apart.</p>



<p>This suggestion could help solve a decades-old mystery about <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.04469">what destroys many “long-period” comets</a>, astronomer David Jewitt reports in a study submitted August 8 to arXiv.org. Long-period comets <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/tiny-object-points-remote-solar-system-reservoir">originate in the Oort cloud</a>, a sphere of icy objects at the solar system’s fringe (<em>SN: 8/18/08</em>). Those that survive their first trip around the sun tend to swing by our star only once every 200 years.</p>





<p>“These things are stable out there in the Oort cloud where nothing ever happens. When they come toward the sun, they heat up, all hell breaks loose, and they fall apart,” Jewitt says.</p>



<p>The Dutch astronomer Jan Oort first proposed the Oort cloud as a cometary reservoir in 1950. He realized that many of its comets that came near Earth were first-time visitors, not return travelers. Something was taking the comets out, but no one knew what.</p>



<p>One possibility was that the comets die by sublimating all of their water away as they near the heat of the sun until there’s nothing left. But that didn’t fit with observations of comets that seemed to physically break up into smaller pieces. The trouble was, those breakups are hard to watch in real time.</p>



<p>“The disintegrations are really hard to observe because they’re unpredictable, and they happen quickly,” Jewitt says.</p>



<p>He ran into that difficulty when he tried to observe Comet Leonard, a bright comet that put on a spectacular show in winter 2021–2022. Jewitt had applied for time to observe the comet with the Hubble Space Telescope in April and June 2022. But by February, the comet had already disintegrated. “That was a wake-up call,” Jewitt says.</p>



<p>So Jewitt turned to historical observations of long-period comets that came close to the sun since the year 2000. He selected those whose water vapor production had been indirectly measured via an instrument called <a href="http://swan.projet.latmos.ipsl.fr/">SWAN on NASA’s SOHO spacecraft</a>, to see how quickly the comets were losing mass. He also picked out comets whose movements deviating from their orbits around the sun had been measured. Those motions are a result of water vapor jets pushing the comet around, like a spraying hose flopping around a garden.</p>



<p>That left him with 27 comets, seven of which did not survive their closest approach to the sun.</p>



<p>Jewitt expected that the most active comets would disintegrate the fastest, by puffing away all their water. But he found the opposite: It turns out that the least active comets with the smallest dirty snowball cores were the most at risk of falling apart.</p>



<p>“Basically, being a small nucleus near the sun causes you to die,” Jewitt says. “The question is, why?”</p>



<p>It wasn’t that the comets were torn apart by the sun’s gravity — they didn’t get close enough for that. And simply sublimating until they went poof would have been too slow a death to match the observations. The comets are also unlikely to collide with anything else in the vastness of space and break apart that way. And a previous suggestion that pressure builds up inside the comets until they explode like a hand grenade doesn’t make sense to Jewitt. Comets’ upper few centimeters of material would absorb most of the sun’s heat, he says, so it would be difficult to heat the center of the comet enough for that to work.</p>



<p>The best remaining explanation, Jewitt says, is rotational breakup. As the comet nears the sun and its water heats up enough to sublimate, jets of water vapor form and make the core start to spin like a catherine wheel firework. Smaller cores are easier to push around than a larger one, so they spin more easily.</p>



<p>“It just spins faster and faster, until it doesn’t have enough tensile strength to hold together,” Jewitt says. “I’m pretty sure that’s what’s happening.”</p>



<p>That deadly spin speed is actually quite slow. Spinning at about half a meter per second could spell curtains for a kilometer-sized comet, he calculates. “You can walk faster.”</p>



<p>But comets are fragile. If you held a fist-sized comet in front of your face, a sneeze would destroy it, says planetary astronomer Nalin Samarasinha of the Planetary Science Institute in Tucson, who was not involved in the study.</p>



<p>Samarasinha thinks Jewitt’s proposal is convincing. “Even though the sample size is small, I think it is something really happening.” But other things might be destroying these comets too, he says, and Jewitt agrees.</p>



<p>Samarasinha is holding out for more comet observations, which could come when the <a href="https://www.lsst.org/">Vera Rubin Observatory</a> begins surveying the sky in 2023. Jewitt’s idea “is something which can be observationally tested in a decade or two.”</p>
