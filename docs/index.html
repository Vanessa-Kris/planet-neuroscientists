              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/chemistry-nobel-prize-2021-molecule-build-tool-list-macmillan">An easier, greener way to build molecules wins the chemistry Nobel Prize</a></h4>

              
                <p>Making molecules is hard work. Atoms must be stitched together into specific arrangements through a series of chemical reactions that are often slow, convoluted and wasteful. The 2021 Nobel Prize in chemistry recognizes two scientists who developed a tool at the turn of the century that revolutionized how chemists construct new molecules, making the process faster and more environmentally friendly.</p>



<p>Chemists Benjamin List of the Max-Planck-Institut für Kohlenforschung in Mülheim an der Ruhr, Germany and David MacMillan of Princeton University were awarded the prize for independently developing organic catalysts that speed up chemical reactions necessary for constructing specific molecules, a process called asymmetric organocatalysis. The two will share the prize of 10 million Swedish kroner (more than $1.1 million), the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences announced October 6 in a news conference in Stockholm.</p>



<p>“This is a fitting recognition of very important work,” says H.N. Cheng, president of the American Chemical Society.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“We can think of chemists as magicians having magic wands in the lab,” Cheng says. “We wave the wand and a reaction goes on.” These Nobel laureates gave chemists “a new wand,” that’s drastically more efficient and less wasteful, he says.</p>





<p>Making new drugs or designing novel materials often requires building new molecules from simpler chemical building blocks. But these chemical building blocks can’t just be thrown together. Instead, they must be carefully combined in precise arrangements through a series of chemical reactions. Many chemical reactions produce two versions of a molecule that are mirror images of one another, and often those two versions can have very different effects. For example, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/return-thalidomide">thalidomide</a>, a drug prescribed in the 1950s and ‘60s for morning sickness, caused birth defects in more than 10,000 babies because of one mirror image of this molecule (<em>SN: 12/24/94</em>). Consequently, building these asymmetric molecules and controlling which version of a molecule gets produced is extremely important, especially for drug development.</p>





<p>Chemical reactions can be coaxed along by catalysts — molecular workhorses that accelerate chemical reactions without being transformed by them. Historically, chemists have known about two kinds of catalysts: enzymes and metal complexes. Enzymes are big, clunky proteins that have been honed by evolution to perform very specific chemical actions in the body, but they can be difficult to use on a large scale in the lab. <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/new-greener-catalysts-are-built-speed">Metals, such as platinum or cobalt, can kick-start some reactions too</a>, but many only work in airless, waterless environments that are difficult to achieve in manufacturing contexts (<em>SN: 2/21/17</em>). Additionally, many metal catalysts are also toxic to the environment and expensive to procure.</p>



<p>For much of the history of chemistry, these were the only tools available to chemists who wanted to make new molecules. “But in the year 2000, everything changed,” Pernilla Wittung-Stafshede, a chemist at Chalmers University of Technology in Gothenburg, Sweden and a member of the Nobel Committee for Chemistry, said during the news conference.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Benjamin List, then at Scripps Research Institute in La Jolla, Calif., was studying the aldol reaction, which links two molecules together through carbon bonds. In organisms, such reactions are crucial for converting food into energy, and depend on a large and complex enzyme called aldolase A. Only a small part of the enzyme actually catalyzes the reaction, however, and List discovered that a single amino acid — proline — could do the work of this big clunky protein while also producing one version of the final product much more often than the other.</p>

<p>“When I did this experiment, I didn’t know what would happen and I thought maybe it’s a stupid idea,” List said during the news conference. “When I saw it work, I did feel it could be something big.”</p>



<p>Unbeknown to List, MacMillan was also looking for alternative organic catalysts around the same time. MacMillan, then at the University of California, Berkeley, focused on another chemical reaction, the <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/diels-alder-reaction-gains-nobel-prize">Diels-Alder reaction</a>, which forms rings of carbon atoms (<em>SN: 11/18/50</em>). It’s an important reaction, used today to make products as different as rubber and pharmaceuticals, but was very slow and relied on finicky metal catalysts that wouldn’t work when wet. MacMillan designed small organic molecules that mimicked the catalytic action of metals in a simpler way, while also favoring the production of one of two possible mirror images of the final product. He coined this new kind of catalysis “asymmetric organocatalysis<em>.”</em></p>

<p>List’s and MacMillan’s discoveries set off an explosion of research into finding more organocatalysts over the next two decades, work that’s aided drug discovery among other uses.&nbsp;</p>



<p>About 35 percent of the world’s gross domestic product depends on catalysis, Peter Somfai, a chemist at Lund University in Sweden and a member of the Nobel Committee for Chemistry, said during the news conference. “We now have a new powerful tool available for making organic molecules,” one that can be drastically more efficient and greener than previous methods.</p>



<p>Somfai highlighted this leap forward in efficiency using the neurotoxin strychnine. The molecule itself isn’t useful for chemists, but its complicated structure makes it a good benchmark for comparing different synthesis methodologies. Previously, chemists relied on an extremely wasteful process of 29 different reactions where just 0.0009 percent of the initial material became strychnine. Using organocatalysis, strychnine can now be synthesized in just 12 steps, and the whole process is 7,000 times more efficient, Somfai said. And because this extra efficiency is gained without using toxic metals, organocatalysis is a more environmentally friendly way of synthesizing chemicals.</p>



<p>If building new molecules is like playing chess, organocatalysis has “completely changed the game,” Somfai said. “It’s like adding a new chess piece that can move in different ways.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/james-webb-space-telescope-launch-space-science-cosmos-exoplanets">When James Webb launches, it will have a bigger to-do list than 1980s researchers suspected</a></h4>

              
                <p class="has-drop-cap" style="font-size:20px">The James Webb Space Telescope has been a long time coming. When it launches later this year, the observatory will be the largest and most complex telescope ever sent into orbit. Scientists have been drafting and redrafting their dreams and plans for this unique tool since 1989.</p>



<p>The mission was originally scheduled to launch between 2007 and 2011, but a series of budget and technical issues pushed its start date back more than a decade. Remarkably, the core design of the telescope hasn’t changed much. But the science that it can dig into has. In the years of waiting for Webb to be ready, big scientific questions have emerged. When Webb was an early glimmer in astronomers’ eyes, cosmological revolutions like the discoveries of dark energy and planets orbiting stars outside our solar system hadn’t yet happened.</p>



<p>“<a href="https://www.stsci.edu/jwst/about-jwst/history">It’s been over 25 years</a>,” says cosmologist Wendy Freedman of the University of Chicago. “But I think it was really worth the wait.”</p>



<h4>An audacious plan<br></h4>





<p>Webb has a distinctive design. Most space telescopes house a single lens or mirror within a tube that blocks sunlight from swamping the dim lights of the cosmos. But Webb’s massive 6.5-meter-wide mirror and its scientific instruments are exposed to the vacuum of space. A multilayered shield the size of a tennis court will block light from the sun, Earth and moon.</p>



<p>For the awkward shape to fit on a rocket, Webb will launch folded up, then unfurl itself in space (see below, What could go wrong?).</p>



<p>“They call this the origami satellite,” says astronomer Scott Friedman of the Space Telescope Science Institute, or STScI, in Baltimore. Friedman is in charge of Webb’s postlaunch choreography. “Webb is different from any other telescope that’s flown.”</p>



<div class="wp-block-sciencenews-content-sidebar">
<h3>A novel design</h3>



<p>Once all is unfolded, the James Webb Space Telescope’s sun shield will span the length of a tennis court to protect the main and secondary mirrors from the sun, moon and Earth’s light and heat. The solar panels, exposed to the sun, will convert light to electricity to power the instruments. Webb’s antenna will keep it communicating with scientists on Earth, sending data from the scientific instruments. The stabilization flap keeps the machine from veering off course.</p>

<p>Its basic design hasn’t changed in more than 25 years. The telescope was first proposed in September 1989 at a workshop held at STScI, which also runs the Hubble Space Telescope.</p>



<p>At the time, Hubble was less than a year from launching, and was expected to function for only 15 years. Thirty-one years after its launch, the telescope is still going strong, despite a series of <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/hubble-new-trouble-probably-wont-doom-space-telescope">computer glitches and gyroscope failures</a> (<em>SN Online: 10/10/18</em>).</p>



<p>The institute director at the time, Riccardo Giacconi, was concerned that the next major mission would take longer than 15 years to get off the ground. So he and others proposed that <a href="https://jwst.nasa.gov/index.html">NASA investigate a possible successor to Hubble</a>: a space telescope with a 10-meter-wide primary mirror that was sensitive to light in infrared wavelengths to complement Hubble’s range of ultraviolet, visible and near-infrared.</p>



<p>Infrared light has a longer wavelength than light that is visible to human eyes. But it’s perfect for a telescope to look back in time. Because light travels at a fixed speed, looking at distant objects in the universe means seeing them as they looked in the past. The universe is expanding, so that light is stretched before it reaches our telescopes. For the most distant objects in the universe — the first galaxies to clump together, or the first stars to burn in those galaxies — light that was originally emitted in shorter wavelengths is stretched all the way to the infrared.</p>



<p>Giacconi and his collaborators dreamed of a telescope that would detect that stretched light from the earliest galaxies. When Hubble started sharing its views of the early universe, the dream solidified into a science plan. The galaxies Hubble saw at great distances “looked different from what people were expecting,” says astronomer Massimo Stiavelli, a leader of the James Webb Space Telescope project who has been at STScI since 1995. “People started thinking that there is interesting science here.”</p>



<p>In 1995, STScI and NASA commissioned a report to design Hubble’s successor. The report, led by astronomer Alan Dressler of the Carnegie Observatories in Pasadena, Calif., suggested an infrared space observatory with a 4-meter-wide mirror.</p>



<p>The bigger a telescope’s mirror, the more light it can collect, and the farther it can see. Four meters wasn’t that much larger than Hubble’s 2.4-meter-wide mirror, but anything bigger would be difficult to launch.</p>



<p>Dressler briefed then-NASA Administrator Dan Goldin in late 1995. In January 1996 at the American Astronomical Society’s annual meeting, Goldin challenged the scientists to be more ambitious. He called out Dressler by name, saying, “Why do you ask for such a modest thing? Why not go after six or seven meters?” (Still nowhere near Giacconi’s pie-in-the-sky 10-meter wish.) The speech received a standing ovation.</p>



<p>Six meters was a larger mirror than had ever flown in space, and larger than would fit in available launch vehicles. Scientists would have to design a telescope mirror that could fold, then deploy once it reached space.</p>



<p>The telescope would also need to cool itself passively by radiating heat into space. It needed a sun shield — a big one. The origami telescope was born. It was dubbed James Webb in 2002 for NASA’s administrator from 1961 to 1968, who fought to support research to boost understanding of the universe in the increasingly human-focused space program. (In response to a May petition to change the name, <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-021-02678-1">NASA investigated allegations</a> that James Webb persecuted gay and lesbian people during his government career. The agency announced on September 27 that it found no evidence warranting a name change.)</p>



<div class="wp-block-sciencenews-content-sidebar">
<h3>Mixed views</h3>



<p>Webb will observe the universe in wavelengths that are mostly longer than what humans can see (0.38 to 0.7 micrometers) and what the Hubble Space Telescope can observe, yet shorter than most of the Spitzer Space Telescope’s range.

<p>Goldin’s motto at NASA was “Faster, better, cheaper.” Bigger was better for Webb, but it sure wasn’t faster — or cheaper. By late 2010, the project <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/cost-overruns-and-delays-add-65-billion-nasas-next-gen-space-telescope">was more than $1.4 billion over its $5.1 billion budget</a> (<em>SN: 4/9/11, p. 22</em>). And it was going to take another five years to be ready. Today, the cost is estimated at almost $10 billion.</p>



<p>The telescope survived a near-cancellation by Congress, and its timeline was reset for an October 2018 launch. But in 2017, the launch was pushed to June 2019. Two more delays in 2018 pushed the takeoff to May 2020, then to March 2021. Some of those delays were because assembling and testing the spacecraft took longer than NASA expected.</p>



<p>Other slowdowns were because of human errors, like using the wrong cleaning solvent, which damaged valves in the propulsion system. Recent shutdowns due to the coronavirus pandemic pushed the launch back a few more months.</p>



<p>“I don’t think we ever imagined it would be this long,” says University of Chicago’s Freedman, who worked on the Dressler report. But there’s one silver lining: Science marched on.</p>



<h4>The age conflict</h4>



<p>The first science goal <a href="https://www.stsci.edu/stsci/org/hst-and-beyond-report.pdf">listed in the Dressler report</a> was “the detailed study of the birth and evolution of normal galaxies such as the Milky Way.” That is still the dream, partly because it’s such an ambitious goal, Stiavelli says.</p>



<p>“We wanted a science rationale that would resist the test of time,” he says. “We didn’t want to build a mission that would do something that gets done in some other way before you’re done.”</p>



<p>Webb will peek at galaxies and stars as they were just 400 million years after the Big Bang, which astronomers think is the epoch when the first tiny galaxies began making the universe transparent to light by stripping electrons from cosmic hydrogen.</p>



<p>But in the 1990s, astronomers had a problem: There didn’t seem to be enough time in the universe to make galaxies much earlier than the ones astronomers had already seen. The standard cosmology at the time suggested the universe was 8 billion or 9 billion years old, but there were stars in the Milky Way that seemed to be about 14 billion years old.</p>



<p>“There was this age conflict that reared its head,” Freedman says. “You can’t have a universe that’s younger than the oldest stars. The way people put it was, ‘You can’t be older than your grandmother!’”</p>



<div class="wp-block-sciencenews-content-sidebar">
<h3>Getting there</h3>



<p>Webb will orbit the sun from a stable point in space called L2, 1.5 million kilometers from Earth. The telescope will spend its first month after launch getting to this point and unfolding its sun shield and mirrors. The sun shield will face Earth and the sun at all times, keeping their light and heat away from the telescope’s sensitive instruments. Once at L2, the telescope will spend another five months turning on and testing its scientific instruments before collecting data.</p>

<p>In 1998, two teams of cosmologists showed that the universe is expanding at an ever-increasing rate. A mysterious substance dubbed dark energy may be pushing the universe to expand faster and faster. That accelerated expansion means the universe is older than astronomers previously thought — the current estimate is about 13.8 billion years old.</p>



<p>“That resolved the age conflict,” Freedman says. “The discovery of dark energy changed everything.” And it expanded Webb’s to-do list.</p>



<h4>Dark energy</h4>



<p>Top of the list is getting to the bottom of a mismatch in cosmic measurements. Since at least 2014, different methods for measuring the universe’s rate of expansion — called the Hubble constant — have been giving different answers. Freedman calls the issue “the most important problem in cosmology today.”</p>



<p>The question, Freedman says, is whether the mismatch is real. A real mismatch could indicate something profound about the nature of dark energy and the history of the universe. But the discrepancy could just be due to measurement errors.</p>



<p>Webb can help settle the debate. One common way to determine the Hubble constant is by measuring the distances and speeds of far-off galaxies. Measuring cosmic distances is difficult, but astronomers can estimate them using objects of known brightness, called standard candles. If you know the object’s actual brightness, you can calculate its distance based on how bright it seems from Earth.</p>



<p>Studies using supernovas and variable stars called Cepheids as candles have found an expansion rate of 74.0 kilometers per second for approximately every 3 million light-years, or megaparsec, of distance between objects. But using red giant stars, Freedman and colleagues have gotten a smaller answer: 69.8 km/s/Mpc.</p>



<p>Other studies have measured the Hubble constant by looking at the dim glow of light emitted just 380,000 years after the Big Bang, called the cosmic microwave background. Calculations based on that glow give a smaller rate still: 67.4 km/s/Mpc. Although these numbers may seem close, the fact that they disagree at all could alter our understanding of the contents of the universe and how it evolves over time. The discrepancy has been called a <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/debate-universe-expansion-rate-hubble-constant-physics-crisis">crisis in cosmology</a> (<em>SN: 9/14/19, p. 22</em>).</p>



<p><a href="https://www.stsci.edu/jwst/science-execution/approved-programs/cycle-1-go">In its first year, Webb will observe</a> some of the same galaxies used in the supernova studies, using three different objects as candles: Cepheids, red giants and peculiar stars called carbon stars.</p>



<p>The telescope will also try to measure the Hubble constant using a distant gravitationally lensed galaxy. Comparing those measurements with each other and with similar ones from Hubble will show if earlier measurements were just wrong, or if the tension between measurements is real, Freedman says.</p>



<p>Without these new observations, “we were just going to argue about the same things forever,” she says. “We just need better data. And [Webb] is poised to deliver it.”</p>



<div class="wp-block-sciencenews-content-sidebar">
<h3>What could go wrong?</h3>



<p>For the James Webb Space Telescope, getting into space is just step one. The telescope must complete a complicated series of unfolding steps before it can observe the cosmos. The entire sequence, including getting the science instruments ready, will take about six months.</p>



<p>“A lot has to go right, that’s for sure,” says astronomer Scott Friedman of the Space Telescope Science Institute in Baltimore, who is in charge of this timeline. Webb will be heading to a point in space called L2, which is too far from Earth for astronauts to visit and make repairs. “There’s every reason to believe things will go very well,” Friedman says. “But we won’t know until we get there.”</p>

</div><figcaption><br>Here’s a timeline of what has to go right (all times are approximate).</figcaption></figure>
</div>



<h4>Exoplanets</h4>



<p>Perhaps the biggest change for Webb science has been the rise of the field of exoplanet explorations.</p>



<p>“When this was proposed, exoplanets were scarcely a thing,” says STScI’s Friedman. “And now, of course, it’s one of the hottest topics in all of science, especially all of astronomy.”</p>



<p>The Dressler report’s second major goal for Hubble’s successor was “the detection of Earthlike planets around other stars and the search for evidence of life on them.” But back in 1995, only a handful of planets orbiting other sunlike stars were even known, and all of them were scorching-hot gas giants — nothing like Earth at all.</p>



<p>Since then, astronomers have discovered thousands of exoplanets orbiting distant stars. Scientists now estimate that, on average, there is at least one planet for every star we see in the sky. And some of the planets are small and rocky, with the right temperatures to support liquid water, and maybe life.</p>



<p>Most of the known planets were discovered as they crossed, or transited, in front of their parent stars, blocking a little bit of the parent star’s light. Astronomers soon realized that, if those planets have atmospheres, a sensitive telescope could effectively sniff the air by examining the starlight that filters through the atmosphere.</p>



<p>The infrared Spitzer Space Telescope, which launched in 2003, and Hubble have started this work. But Spitzer ran out of coolant in 2009, keeping it too warm to measure important molecules in exoplanet atmospheres. And Hubble is not sensitive to some of the most interesting wavelengths of light — the ones that could reveal alien life-forms.</p>



<p>That’s where Webb is going to shine. If Hubble is peeking through a crack in a door, Webb will throw the door wide open, says exoplanet scientist Nikole Lewis of Cornell University. Crucially, Webb, unlike Hubble, will be particularly sensitive to several carbon-bearing molecules in exoplanet atmospheres that might be signs of life.</p>



<p>“Hubble can’t tell us anything really about carbon, carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide, methane,” she says.</p>



<p>If Webb had launched in 2007, it could have missed this whole field. Even though the first transiting exoplanet was discovered in 1999, their numbers were low for the next decade.</p>



<p>Lewis remembers thinking, when she started grad school in 2007, that she could make a computer model of all the transiting exoplanets. “Because there were literally only 25,” she says.</p>



<div class="wp-block-sciencenews-content-sidebar">
<h3>Transit advantages</h3>



<p>Webb will measure the composition of exoplanet atmospheres by looking at the light from the planet’s host star as the planet crosses in front of the star. Atoms and molecules in the atmosphere, such as sodium (Na) and potassium (K), absorb certain wavelengths of the starlight, leaving a unique fingerprint in the spectrum of light that reaches Webb’s detectors.</p>

</div>



<p>Between 2009 and 2018, NASA’s Kepler space telescope raked in transiting planets by the thousands. But those planets were too dim and distant for Webb to probe their atmospheres.</p>



<p>So the down-to-the-wire delays of the last few years have actually been good for exoplanet research, Lewis says. “The launch delays were one of the best things that’s happened for exoplanet science with Webb,” she says. “Full stop.”</p>



<p>That’s mainly thanks to NASA’s Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite, <a href="https://exoplanets.nasa.gov/tess/">or TESS</a>, which launched in April 2018. TESS’ job is to find planets orbiting the brightest, nearest stars, which will give Webb the best shot at detecting interesting molecules in planetary atmospheres.</p>



<p>If it had launched in 2018, Webb would have had to wait a few years for TESS to pick out the best targets. Now, it can get started on those worlds right away. Webb’s first year of observations will include probing several known exoplanets that have been hailed as possible places to find life. Scientists will survey planets orbiting small, cool stars called M dwarfs to make sure such planets even have atmospheres, a question that has been hotly debated.</p>



<p>If a sign of life does show up on any of these planets, that result will be fiercely debated, too, Lewis says. “There will be a huge kerfuffle in the literature when that comes up.” It will be hard to compare planets orbiting M dwarfs with Earth, because these planets and their stars are so different from ours. Still, “let’s look and see what we find,” she says.</p>



<h4>A limited lifetime</h4>



<p>With its components assembled, tested and folded at Northrop Grumman’s facilities in California, Webb is on its way by boat through the Panama Canal, ready to launch in an Ariane 5 rocket from French Guiana. The most recent launch date is set for December 18.</p>



<p>For the scientists who have been working on Webb for decades, this is a nostalgic moment.</p>



<p>“You start to relate to the folks who built the pyramids,” Stiavelli says.</p>



<p>Other scientists, who grew up in a world where Webb was always on the horizon, are already thinking about the next big thing.</p>



<p>“I’m pretty sure, barring epic disaster, that [Webb] will carry my career through the next decade,” Lewis says. “But I have to think about what I’ll do in the<em> next</em> decade” after that.<br><br>Unlike Hubble, which has lasted decades thanks to fixes by astronauts and upgrade missions, Webb has a strictly limited lifetime. Orbiting the sun at a gravitationally fixed point called L2, Webb will be too far from Earth to repair, and will need to burn small amounts of fuel to stay in position. The fuel will last for at least five years, and hopefully as much as 10. But when the fuel runs out, Webb is finished. The telescope operators will move it into retirement in an out-of-the-way orbit around the sun, and bid it farewell.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/earth-venus-collision-planet-formation">Space rocks may have bounced off baby Earth, but slammed into Venus</a></h4>

              
                <p>Squabbling sibling planets may have hurled space rocks when they were young.</p>



<p>Simulations suggest that space rocks the size of baby planets struck both the newborn Earth and Venus, but many of the rocks that only grazed Earth went on to hit — and stick — to Venus. That difference in early impacts could help explain <a href="https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/PSJ/ac19b1#fnref-psjac19b1bib8">why Earth and Venus are such different worlds today</a>, researchers report September 23 in the <em>Planetary Science Journal</em>.</p>



<p>“The pronounced differences between Earth and Venus, in spite of their similar orbits and masses, has been one of the biggest puzzles in our solar system,” says planetary scientist Shigeru Ida of the Tokyo Institute of Technology, who was not involved in the new work. This study introduces “a new point that has not been raised before.”</p>



<p>Scientists have typically thought that there are two ways that collisions between baby planets can go. The objects could graze each other and each continue on its way, in a hit-and-run collision. Or two protoplanets could stick together, or accrete, making one larger planet. Planetary scientists often assume that every hit-and-run collision eventually leads to accretion. Objects that collide must have orbits that cross each other’s, so they’re bound to collide again and again, and eventually should stick.</p>





<p>But previous work from planetary scientist Erik Asphaug of the University of Arizona in Tucson and others suggests that isn’t so. It takes special conditions for two planets to merge, Asphaug says, like relatively slow impact speeds, so hit-and-runs were probably much more common in the young solar system.</p>



<p>Asphaug and colleagues wondered what that might have meant for Earth and Venus, two apparently similar planets with vastly different climates. Both worlds are about the same size and mass, but Earth is wet and clement while <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/what-will-it-take-go-venus">Venus is a searing, acidic hellscape</a> (<em>SN: 2/13/18</em>).</p>



<p>“If they started out on similar pathways, somehow Venus took a wrong turn,” Asphaug says.</p>



<p>The team ran about 4,000 computer simulations in which Mars-sized protoplanets crashed into a young Earth or Venus, assuming the two planets were at their current distances from the sun. The researchers found that about half of the time, incoming protoplanets grazed Earth without directly colliding. Of those, about half went on to collide with Venus.</p>



<p>Unlike Earth, Venus ended up accreting most of the objects that hit it in the simulations. Hitting Earth first slowed incoming objects down enough to let them stick to Venus later, the study suggests. “You have this imbalance where things that hit the Earth, but don’t stick, tend to end up on Venus,” Asphaug says. “We have a fundamental explanation for why Venus ended up accreting differently from the Earth.”</p>



<p>If that’s really what happened, it would have had a significant effect on the composition of the two worlds. Earth would have ended up with more of the outer mantle and crust material from the incoming protoplanets, while Venus would have gotten more of their iron-rich cores.</p>



<p>The imbalance in impacts could even explain some major Venusian mysteries, like why the planet doesn’t have a moon, why it spins so slowly and why it lacks a magnetic field — though “these are hand-waving kind of conjectures,” Asphaug says.</p>



<p>Ida says he hopes that future work will look into those questions more deeply. “I’m looking forward to follow-up studies to examine if the new result actually explains the Earth-Venus difference,” he says.</p>



<p>The idea fits into a growing debate among planetary scientists about how the solar system grew up, says planetary scientist Seth Jacobson of Michigan State University in East Lansing. Was it built violently, with lots of giant collisions, or calmly, with planets growing smoothly via pebbles sticking together?</p>



<p>“This paper falls on the end of lots of giant impacts,” Jacobson says.</p>



<p>Each rocky planet in the solar system should have very different chemistry and structure depending on which scenario is true. But scientists know the chemistry and structure of only one planet with any confidence: Earth. And Earth’s early history has been overwritten by plate tectonics and other geologic activity. “Venus is the missing link,” Jacobson says. “Learning more about Venus’ chemistry and interior structure is going to tell us more about whether it had a giant impact or not.”</p>



<p>Three <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/nasa-venus-mission-davinci-veritas-space-planetary-science">missions to Venus</a> are expected to launch in the late 2020s and 2030s (<em>SN: 6/2/21</em>). Those should help, but none are expected to take the kind of detailed composition measurements that could definitively solve the mystery. That would take a long-lived lander, or a sample return mission, both of which would be extremely difficult on hot, hostile Venus.</p>



<p>“I wish there was an easier way to test it,” Jacobson says. “I think that’s where we should concentrate our energy as terrestrial planet formation scientists going forward.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2021/10/06/language-proficiency-can-determine-how-similarly-first-and-second-languages-are-represented-in-the-brain/">Language Proficiency Can Determine How Similarly First And Second Languages Are Represented In The Brain</a></h4>

              
                <p><em>By&nbsp;</em><a href="https://twitter.com/E_Barratt">Emma L. Barratt</a></p>



<p>Researchers widely agree that first and second languages are handled similarly in the brain. According to previous research, proficient bilinguals’ brain activity is broadly quite similar when accessing their first and second languages.</p>



<p>However, the literature exploring this until now has relied on imaging methods that can tell us <em>where</em> in the brain there is activity, but not <em>how</em> languages are represented in those areas. Distinct patterns of activation may have differentiated first and second languages in those same regions all this time, and by relying on traditional forms of imaging analysis alone, we could have been none the wiser.</p>



<p>Thanks to new imaging methods, however, we’re finally able to take a look at activation in these areas in a much more detailed way. Now, <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/hbm.25633?af=R">newly published work</a> from Emily Nichols at The University of Western Ontario and colleagues suggests that languages are represented more distinctly than we thought.</p>



<span id="more-44021"></span>



<p>For this study, the researchers gathered a sample of 32 bilingual English and Mandarin speakers living in Beijing. All participants spoke English as their first language, and Mandarin as their second. As might be expected, the age of acquisition (AoA) and proficiency of Mandarin — as measured by self-report and pre-testing, respectively — varied from person to person.</p>



<p>During their fMRI scans, participants were presented with a picture-word matching task in both English and Mandarin. For each trial of this task, they were shown a picture for 2.5 seconds, while an audio clip of a common two-syllable word, which either matched or didn’t match the image shown, was played. These audio clips alternated between English and Mandarin for all 160 trials, and participants were asked to indicate as quickly as possible via button press whether or not the audio given matched the contents of the image.</p>



<p>The team then used a technique known as representational similarity analysis (RSA) on imaging data collected during correct trials, in order to see which brain areas reliably showed different patterns of activation between languages. This fMRI technique is relatively new, and can reveal differences in similar activation patterns which were previously unmeasurable. For example, a previous study looking at reading in bilingual individuals used RSA to show distinct activation patterns in regions which handle visual word recognition when participants read text in each language. Here, the team hoped to apply this same method to probe brain activity during auditory, rather than visual, word recognition.</p>



<p>As expected, both English and Mandarin produced activity in an extensive network of language-related regions. When the team looked within those regions that were active for both languages, there were no overall significant differences in activation depending on language. However, the story changed when the team looked in more detail at the effects of AoA and proficiency on the levels of activation.</p>



<p>These analyses revealed that there were differences in how the two languages were represented, which could be predicted by AoA and proficiency. For example, people with a wider difference in first and second language proficiency showed more dissimilar patterns of activation in areas such as the left inferior fusiform gyrus and bilateral supramarginal gyrus, which are involved in articulation and auditory-motor integration, respectively. The more similar the proficiency between the two languages, the more similar the activation pattern. Likewise, the older the AoA, the more distinct the patterns of activation between first and second languages were.</p>



<p>In addition, results showed several areas that were more active in those with younger AoAs — the right insula, the left anterior intraparietal sulcus, and the area prostriata of the calcarine sulcus. However, the relationship between these regions and bilingual auditory word recognition is less clear. It’s likely that differences in activation in these areas, at least in part, represent differences in the ability to inhibit other language responses. But, further research is needed to disentangle exactly what these differences mean, and how they relate to AoA.</p>



<p>Interestingly, there was also a distinct dissimilarity between participants with lower second language proficiency and those who acquired their second language later in ventral visual areas, which handle object recognition and concept representation. This, the authors suggest, is indicative that language can likely affect our perceptions of what we’re looking at. This idea isn’t totally unheard of, either — <a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2012.00054/full">previous research</a> outlining the label-feedback hypothesis also highlighted that variations in language can alter our ability to categorise, discriminate between, and even detect objects.</p>



<p>These findings not only support the current model of an integrated language system in bilinguals, but they extend our understanding of how individual differences dictate language representations within the brain. Future research to verify that these patterns are consistent across languages, or whether they vary by language similarity, are likely to give us a greater understanding of whether these results are in part due to the large differences between English and Mandarin. Research using RSA which looks into the effect grammar may have on differences in brain activation is also a topic for investigation. As it stands, this study represents a new and exciting approach for disentangling finer differences in how the brain represents and utilises first and second languages.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/nobel-prize-physics-2021-complex-systems-climate">Work on complex systems, including Earth’s climate, wins the physics Nobel Prize</a></h4>

              
                <p>Earth’s climate is a vastly complex system on a grand scale. On a microscopic level, so is the complicated physics of atoms and molecules found within materials. The 2021 Nobel Prize in physics knits together the work of three scientists who illuminated such intricate physical systems by harnessing basic tools of physics.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Half of the prize goes to climate scientists Syukuro Manabe of Princeton University and Klaus Hasselmann of the Max Planck Institute for Meteorology in Hamburg, Germany, for their work on simulations of Earth’s climate and predictions of global warming, the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences announced October 5. The other half of the 10 million Swedish kronor (more than $1.1 million) prize goes to physicist Giorgio Parisi of Sapienza University of Rome, who worked on understanding the roiling fluctuations within disordered materials.</p>



<p>All three researchers used a similar strategy of isolating a specific piece of a complex system in a model, a mathematical representation of something found in nature. By studying that model, and then integrating that understanding into more complicated descriptions, the researchers made progress on understanding otherwise perplexing systems, says physicist Brad Marston of Brown University. “There’s an art to constructing a model that is rich enough to give you interesting and perhaps surprising results, but simple enough that you can hope to understand it.”</p>





<p>The prize, normally an apolitical affair, sends a message to world leaders: “The notion of global warming is resting on solid science,” said Göran Hansson, secretary-general of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences, during the announcement of the prize winners. Human emissions of greenhouse gases, including carbon dioxide, have increased Earth’s average temperature by more than 1 degree Celsius since preindustrial times. That warming is <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/climate-change-un-ipcc-report-humans">affecting every region on Earth</a>, exacerbating extreme weather events such as heat waves, wildfires and drought (<em>SN: 8/9/21</em>).&nbsp;</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="680" height="340" src="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/100521_nobel_physics_inline1.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-3104316" srcset="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/100521_nobel_physics_inline1.jpg 680w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/100521_nobel_physics_inline1-330x165.jpg 330w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><figcaption><span class="caption wp-caption-3104316">Syukuro Manabe of Princeton University (left) and Klaus Hasselmann of the Max Planck Institute for Meteorology (right) worked on early simulations of Earth’s climate, laying the foundation for today’s more detailed climate models that are used to grapple with the potential impacts of global warming.</span><span class="credit wp-credit-3104316">From left: Bengt Nyman/Wikimedia Commons (CC BY 2.0); Sueddeutsche Zeitung Photo/Alamy Stock Photo</span></figcaption></figure></div>



<p>Manabe’s work laid the foundation for climate modeling, said John Wettlaufer of Yale University, a member of the Nobel Committee for Physics. “He really did construct the models from which all future climate models were built,” Wettlaufer explained during an interview after the prize announcement. “That scaffolding is essential for the improvement of predictions of climate.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Manabe studied how rising carbon dioxide levels would change temperatures on Earth. A <a href="https://journals.ametsoc.org/view/journals/atsc/24/3/1520-0469_1967_024_0241_teotaw_2_0_co_2.xml">simplified climate model</a> from a 1967 paper coauthored by Manabe simulated a single column of the atmosphere in which air masses rise and fall as they warm and cool, which revealed that doubling the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere increased the temperature by over 2 degrees C. This understanding could then be integrated into <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/computing-link-between-sea-and-air">more complex models</a> that simulated the entire atmosphere or included the effects of the oceans, for example (<em>SN: 5/30/70</em>). </p>





<p>“I never imagined that this thing I would begin to study had such huge consequences,” Manabe said at a news conference at Princeton. “I was doing it just because of my curiosity.”</p>



<p>Hasselmann studied the evolution of Earth’s climate while taking into account the variety of timescales over which different processes operate. The randomness of daily weather stands in contrast to seasonal variations and much slower processes like gradual heating of the Earth’s oceans. Hassleman’s work helped to show how the short-term jitter could be incorporated into models to understand the long-term change in climate.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The prize is an affirmation of scientists’ understanding of climate, says Michael Moloney, CEO of the American Institute of Physics in College Park, Md. “The climate models which we depend on in order to understand the impact of the climate crisis are world-class science up there with all the other great discoveries that are recognized [by] Nobel Prizes of years past.”</p>

<p>Much like the weather patterns on Earth, the inner world of atoms within materials can be complex and disorderly. Parisi’s work took aim at understanding the processes within disordered systems such as a type of material called a <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/changes-mathematical-state">spin glass</a> (<em>SN: 10/18/02</em>). In spin glasses, atoms behave like small magnets, due to a quantum property called spin. But the atoms can’t agree on which direction to point their magnets, resulting in a disordered arrangement. </p>



<p>That’s similar to more familiar types of glass — a material in which atoms don’t reach an orderly arrangement. Parisi came up with a mathematical description for such spin glasses. His work also touches on a variety of other complex topics, from turbulence to <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/birds-turns-match-math-quantum-matter">flocking patterns</a> that describe the motions of animals such as starlings (<em>SN: 7/31/14</em>).&nbsp;</p>



<p>Although his work doesn’t directly focus on climate, in an interview during the Nobel announcement, Parisi commented on that half of the prize: “It’s clear that for the future generation we have to act now in a very fast way.”&nbsp;</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/radiometric-dating-history-carbon-century-science">Radiometric dating puts pieces of the past in context. Here’s how</a></h4>

              
                <p>When a researcher picks up an object — whether it’s a scrap of leather from a dig site, a fossil from a museum drawer or a newly fallen meteorite — their first question might be, “What is this thing?” A natural follow-up: “How old is it?” The first question is fundamental, no doubt. But the second is powerful, too. It helps place the object in its proper archaeological, geologic or cosmological context. “Without knowing the ages of things, there is no narrative,” says Rick Potts, a paleoanthropologist at the Smithsonian’s National Museum of Natural History in Washington, D.C.</p>



<p>Up until a century or so ago, researchers studying rocks and the fossils they contain could answer the age question only vaguely if at all. Using guidelines established by geologists in the 1600s, they could gauge a rock’s age only in relative terms: For example, Sample A was considered older than Sample B if it came from a lower and presumed older layer of sediment or rock. But Earth is a dynamic place. Missing layers, as well as disturbances from earthquakes, landslides or other upheavals, meant even relative ages for rocks could be difficult to determine. Ditto for the bones, tools and other artifacts within the earth: Previous excavations, or even the day-to-day activities of a site’s ancient residents, could churn the soil and thus disrupt the layers.</p>

<p>The discovery of radioactivity in the mid-1890s paved the way for scientists to ascertain the absolute ages of some objects, says Doug Macdougall, a geochemist formerly at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography and the author of <em>Nature’s Clocks</em>. Within less than a decade, he notes, several physicists had proposed methods for doing so. The methods are based on the finding that each type, or isotope, of a radioactive atom has its own particular half-life — the time that it takes for one-half of the atoms in a sample to decay. Because radioactive decay occurs in the nucleus of the atom, half-life doesn’t change with environmental conditions, from the hellish heat and crushing pressures deep inside Earth to the frigid realm of the far solar system. That makes radioactive isotopes wonderful clocks.</p>



<p>Today, radiometric dating spans the ages, from recent times to the birth of our solar system. Carbon-14 dating is most suited to something that lived during the last 50,000 years or something made from such organisms — the wooden shafts of arrows, the leather in a moccasin or the plant fibers used to weave fabrics or baskets. Longer-lived isotopes of uranium and thorium can help peer deep into Earth’s past — back to when our planet’s first rocks were forming, or even further, to when our solar system was coalescing from gas and dust.</p>



<p>There are several different methods for estimating ages using half-lives, Macdougall explains. For isotopes with relatively rapid decay rates, researchers determine the proportion of a radioactive isotope relative to other atoms of the same element and compare it with how much of that isotope a fresh sample would be expected to have. With that information, along with the known half-life, it’s possible to estimate the age of the original sample.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" width="680" height="371" src="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/sn100_spotlight_radiometric-dating_inline1.jpg" alt="composite image of 5,500-year-old shoe, with close-ups on laces and heel" class="wp-image-3103879" srcset="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/sn100_spotlight_radiometric-dating_inline1.jpg 680w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/sn100_spotlight_radiometric-dating_inline1-330x180.jpg 330w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><figcaption><span class="caption wp-caption-3103879">With radiocarbon dating, this leather shoe, well-preserved in a cave in Armenia, was determined to be 5,500 years old.

<p>This approach works well for carbon-14, possibly one of the most familiar isotopes used in radiometric dating. While a plant or animal is alive, it takes in carbon from the environment. But when the organism dies, that intake stops. Because carbon-14 is created high in Earth’s atmosphere at a fairly constant rate, scientists can readily estimate the amount of that isotope that should be present in a living organism.</p>



<p>Carbon-14 has a half-life of about 5,730 years — which means that 5,730 years after an organism dies, half of the isotope present in the original sample will have decayed. After another 5,730 years, half of the carbon-14 that remained has decayed (leaving one-fourth of the amount from the original sample). Eventually, after 50,000 years or so (or almost nine half-lives), so little carbon-14 remains that the sample can’t be reliably dated.</p>



<p>Besides carbon-14, this technique can be used for short-lived isotopes of sulfur, silicon, phosphorus and beryllium, Macdougall says.</p>

<p>Another method is more suitable for isotopes with long half-lives (and therefore slow rates of decay), Macdougall says. In this approach, scientists measure the amount of a particular isotope in a sample and then compare that with the amounts of various “daughter products” that form as the isotope decays. By taking the ratios of those amounts — or even the ratios of amounts of daughter products alone — and then “running the clock backward,” researchers can estimate when radioactive decay first began (that is, when the object formed).</p>



<p>Scientists still have to be careful. A radiometric clock can be “reset” if either the original isotope or its daughter products are lost to the environment. Robust crystals called zircons, for example, are long-lasting and present in many rocks. But extreme temperatures can drive lead, a daughter product of radioactive uranium and thorium, out of the crystal.</p>



<p>Despite the potential challenges, scientists have used radiometric dating to answer all sorts of questions. Researchers used lead-lead dating — which looks at two lead isotopes, both daughter products of a uranium isotope — to analyze an inclusion inside an ancient meteorite; in 2010, they reported that <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/solar-system-older-estimated">the tiny bleb was about 4.568 billion years old</a>, making it one of the earliest building blocks of our solar system. The team used an aluminum-magnesium dating technique to confirm that great age. Others have used similar techniques to estimate the age of Earth’s oldest known rocks (<a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/precious-little-gems">about 4.4 billion years</a>) and when plate tectonics might have begun (<a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/plate-tectonics-got-early-start">more than 4 billion years ago</a>, according to one study).</p>

ERICKSON</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>And even though some of these techniques are estimating ages billions of years in the past, “they can do so with error bars of only 100,000 years or so,” says Marc Caffee, a physicist at Purdue University in West Lafayette, Ind. “I marvel at the precision these chronometers have,” he adds.</p>



<p>Dating techniques that rely on isotopes with half-lives measured in millions of years can be used to <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/quick-bite-some-gorges-carved-surprisingly-fast">estimate long-term rates of erosion</a> — to help gauge how quickly a canyon was carved, for example — or to infer the onset of glacial activity during recent ice ages.</p>



<p>At least half a dozen radiometric dating techniques can be applied to the last few million years when humans and our kin evolved, says Potts. For example, by using argon-argon dating to pin down the age of tiny crystals in ancient layers of volcanic ash — crystals that had formed during the eruptions themselves — researchers have estimated that the <em>Australopithecus</em> dubbed Lucy lived about 3.18 million years ago. Today’s archaeologists and paleontologists also benefit from another half dozen or so absolute dating techniques beyond radiometric approaches, expanding the types of materials that can be dated, Potts says.</p>



<p>Advances in techniques over time have let researchers analyze increasingly smaller and smaller samples. That, in turn, is less destructive of rare — or even one-of-a-kind — artifacts or fossils. Whereas once researchers had to destroy large samples of material to perform an analysis, “now we can date a single kernel of maize,” says Ryan Williams, an anthropological archaeologist at the Field Museum in Chicago.</p>

<p>Other advances, which have made radiometric dating techniques cheaper and more precise, send researchers back to the lab to reanalyze artifacts, says Suzanne Pilaar Birch, an archaeologist at the University of Georgia in Athens. And more samples and more precision yield more refined chronologies. By radiocarbon dating nearly 100 samples from a mountaintop site in southern Peru, for instance, Williams and his colleagues determined that the site was occupied for more than four centuries.</p>



<p>The results of all this dating, Pilaar Birch notes, are “changing our understanding of the past.”</p>

                <p><em>By </em><a href="http://emilyoliviareynolds.com/">Emily Reynolds</a></p>



<p>Anyone who has worked from home will probably be familiar with the miserable, draining feeling of having spent too much time on Zoom. Such is the pressure of all-day-every-day video calling that some companies have even <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2021/mar/24/zoom-refuseniks-why-companies-are-banning-constant-video-calls">announced</a> Zoom-free Fridays to give employees a little time away from their screens.</p>



<p>The fact that video-calling is tiring, then, will not be news to many of us. But a new study in the <em>Journal of Applied Psychology </em>explores in more detail who is affected the most, finding that both gender and length of time spent within an organisation both impact fatigue. And this suggests that a one-size-fits-all approach to combatting video call burnout may not work for everyone.</p>



<span id="more-44030"></span>



<p>Participants were recruited from a company with a largely remote workforce, used to online meetings even before the pandemic. The company has a camera-optional policy, with around 50% of staff turning their cameras off before the study started. Over nineteen working days, participants were asked to participate in meetings with cameras either on or off for two weeks before switching to the opposite option for the following two weeks.</p>



<p>Every day after work they also completed measures assessing how fatigued they had felt during the day, how engaged they had felt in meetings, and whether or not they felt they had a voice in the meetings.</p>



<p>The results showed that having cameras turned on did indeed make participants feel more fatigued. And this had a knock-on effect. Those who were more fatigued also felt less like they had a voice in their meetings, and felt less engaged.</p>



<p>Gender and length of time at the organisation also had an impact. The relationship between having the camera turned on and fatigue was stronger for women than men, and for those who were new to an organisation compared to those who had been there for a longer time. The indirect impact on voice and engagement was also stronger in women than in men and in newer than older employees.</p>



<p>These results confirm that video calling with a camera on can cause people to feel fatigued, leading them to incur other costs in terms of voice and engagement in meetings. The study also suggests that certain demographics are more likely to have such experiences, potentially affecting their performance and comfort in the workplace.</p>



<p>The team hypothesise that these penalties are incurred due to issues around self-presentation — that is, that being or feeling &#8220;watched&#8221; increases the need to manage others’ impressions and “directs our focus inwards”, tiring us out.  Women and new hires may be particularly prone to anxious self-presentation because of existing appearance standards and a heightened need to appear competent and effective.</p>



<p>The team also notes that other forms of camera — those placed at different angles, for example — may reduce this fatiguing effect; it would also be interesting to see whether having the camera on but hiding the feed from your own screen has similarly negative effects. It would also be worth exploring the long-term impact of Zoom fatigue on general wellbeing.</p>



<p>There may also be <em>positive</em> impacts of having your camera on. People may feel more connected with others when they turn their video on; they may feel more comfortable when presenting; or they may contribute more confidently in meetings. And there may be a secondary positive impact — being in a meeting with <em>others</em> with their camera on could be more reassuring or connecting than one where everyone else’s camera is off. These are all questions that could be addressed in future research.</p>



<p>Overall, however, it seems that employers could benefit from allowing staff to take a flexible approach to turning cameras on, even switching to phone calls or audio-only options if desired by workers. While turning cameras off may have other costs (an inability to see facial expressions, for example), allowing workers to decide what works best for them will likely improve their experience at work.</p>

<html><body><p>Researchers rely on access to scientific data to enhance their understanding of published research, for purposes of verification, replication and reanalysis, to guide future investigations, and to inform systematic reviews or meta-analyses. Depositing data in a repository (as opposed to offering it upon request, or publishing as Supporting Information) further prevents data loss, improves discoverability, and removes barriers to replication and reuse. <strong>For all these reasons, <em>PLOS Pathogens</em> is excited to introduce a new technology solution that makes depositing data simpler and more accessible for our authors.</strong></p>



<h2>Announcing a<em> PLOS Pathogens</em> / Dryad Integration</h2>



<p>As part of a one-year trial beginning <strong>October 5, 2021</strong>, <em>PLOS Pathogens </em>authors now have the option to upload their data files directly to <a href="https://datadryad.org/stash/">Dryad Digital Repository</a> during manuscript submission or revision&mdash;without even leaving our submission system. It takes just minutes to upload a dataset and receive a unique, citable Dryad DOI. If a manuscript is accepted for publication, the associated dataset will undergo Dryad&rsquo;s screening and curatorial process and become public on the site, with links to and from the published research article. Datasets that are part of the trial will be hosted in perpetuity at no cost to authors. Thanks to a <a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2021/09/wellcome-trust-awards-plos-a-grant-to-test-ways-to-increase-sharing-and-discovery-of-research-data/">grant from the Wellcome Trust</a>, we&rsquo;ll be seeking to deeply understand the experience<a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2021/09/wellcome-trust-awards-plos-a-grant-to-test-ways-to-increase-sharing-and-discovery-of-research-data/"> </a>researchers have with this new solution, and will share what we learn with the community.</p>



<h2>Making data deposition free &amp; easy</h2>



<p>Data repositories like Dryad offer <a href="https://plos.org/open-science/open-data/#dryad">important advantages</a>, including data preservation and tracking, facilitating reproducibility, demonstrating rigor, and attracting citations. This integration offers a simple, intuitive interface that makes depositing data with Dryad a part of our authors&rsquo; normal submission workflow. The process is no more challenging than uploading data as Supporting Information, but much more effective as a vehicle for sharing. The year-long trial will show whether a more streamlined process inspires authors to take advantage of the benefits of a data repository.</p>



<h2>What comes next</h2>



<p><em>PLOS Pathogens</em> is among the first journals in our field to offer this new service. We look forward to sharing the outcomes of the <em>PLOS Pathogens</em> / Dryad Integration trial with the research and scientific publishing communities, and we welcome your feedback on your experience, both as a submitting author, and a reader referencing deposited datasets.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://gcamp6f.com/2021/10/04/large-scale-calcium-imaging-noise-levels/">Large-scale calcium imaging & noise levels</a></h4>

              
                <p>Calcium imaging based on two-photon scanning microscopy is a standard method to record the activity of neurons in the living brain. Due to the point-scanning approach, sampling speed is limited and the dwell time on a single neuron reduces with the number of recorded neurons. Therefore, one needs to trade off the number of quasi-simultaneously imaged neurons versus the shot noise level of these recordings.</p>



<p>To give an simplified example, one can distribute the laser power in space and time over 100 neurons at 30 Hz, or 1000 neurons at 3 Hz. Due to the lower sampling rate, the signal-to-noise-ratio (SNR) of the 1000 neurons will decrease as well.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"><strong>A standardized noise level</strong></p>



<p>To compare the shot noise levels across recordings, in our recent paper (<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41593-021-00895-5">Rupprecht et al., 2021</a>) we took advantage of the fact that the slow calcium signal is typically very similar between adjacent frames. Therefore, the noise level can be estimated by</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center has-medium-font-size"><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cnu++%3D+%5Cfrac%7BMedian_t+%5Cmid+%5CDelta+F%2FF_%7Bt%2B1%7D+-+%5CDelta+F%2FF_t+%5Cmid%7D%7B%5Csqrt%7Bf_r%7D%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;nu  = &#92;frac{Median_t &#92;mid &#92;Delta F/F_{t+1} - &#92;Delta F/F_t &#92;mid}{&#92;sqrt{f_r}}" class="latex" /></p>



<p>The median makes sure to exclude outliers that stem from the fast onset dynamics of calcium signals. The normalization by the square root of the frame rate <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f_r&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="f_r" class="latex" /> renders the metric comparable across datasets with different frame rates.</p>



<p>Why the square root? Because shot noise decreases with the number of sampling points <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shot_noise">with a square root dependecy</a>. The only downside of this measure is that the units seem a bit arbitrary (% for dF/F, divided by the square root of seconds), but this does not make it less useful. To compute it on a raw dF/F trace, simple use this simple one-liner in Matlab:</p>



<pre class="wp-block-preformatted has-small-font-size">noise_level = median(abs(diff(dFF_trace)))/sqrt(framerate)</pre>



<p>Or in Python:</p>



<pre class="wp-block-preformatted has-small-font-size">import numpy as np
noise_level = np.median(np.abs(np.diff(dFF_trace)))/np.sqrt(framerate)</pre>



<p>If you want to know more about this metric, check out the Methods part of our paper on more details (<a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.31.272450v2">bioRxiv</a> / <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41593-021-00895-5#Sec13">Nature Neuroscience</a>, subsection &#8220;Computation of noise levels&#8221;).</p>



<p>The metric <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cnu&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;nu" class="latex" /> comes in handy if you want to compare the shot noise levels between calcium imaging datasets and understand whether noise levels are relatively high or low. So, what is a &#8220;high&#8221; noise level?</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"><strong>Comparison of noise levels and neuron numbers across datasets</strong></p>



<p>I collected a couple of publicly available datasets (links and descriptions in the appendix of the blog post) and extracted both the numbers of simultaneously recorded neurons and the shot noise level <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cnu&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;nu" class="latex" />. Each data point stands for one animal, except for the MICrONS dataset, where each dataset stands for a separate session in the same animal.</p>

For excitatory neurons, typically 100-200 neurons were recording with a standard noise level of 1 (units omitted for simplicity). If you distribute the photons across an increasing number of neurons, the shot noise levels should increase with the square root of this multiple (indicated by the black line). Datasets with inhibitory neurons (de Vries et al., red) have by experimental design fewer neurons and therefore lie above the line.</p>



<p>A dataset that I recorded in zebrafish with typically 800-1500 neuron per recording lies pretty much on this line, similar to the MICrONS dataset where they used a mesoscope to record from several thousand cortical neurons simultaneously, at the cost of lower frame rate and therefore higher noise levels.</p>



<p>Two datasets acquired by Pachitariu and colleagues stands out a bit by pushing the number of simultaneously recorded neurons. In 2018, this came at the expense of increased noise levels (pink). In 2019 (a single mouse; grey), despite a dataset with ca. 20,000 simultaneously recorded neurons, the noise level was impressively low, probably due to highly optimized experiments.</p>



<p>In regular experiments, in order to mitigate possible laser-induced photodamage or problems due to overexpression of indicators, noise levels should not be maximized at the cost of physiological damage. For example, the mouse from the MICrONS dataset was later used for dense EM reconstruction; any sort of damage to the tissue, which might be invisible at first glance, could complicate subsequent diffusive penetration with heavy metals or the cutting of nanometer-thick slices. As a bottom line, there are often good reasons not to go for the highest signal yield.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"><strong>Spike inference for high noise levels</strong></p>



<p>To give an idea about the noise level, here is an example for the MICrONS dataset. Due to the noisiness of the recordings (noise level of ca. 8-9), only large transients can be reliably detected. I used <a href="https://github.com/HelmchenLabSoftware/Cascade">spike inference through CASCADE</a> to de-noise the recording. It is also clear from this example that CASCADE extracts useful information, but won&#8217;t be able to recover anything close to single-spike precision for such a noise level.</p>

<p>Above are shown the smooth inferred spike rates (orange) and also the discrete inferred spikes (black). The discrete spikes (black) are nice to look at, but due to the high noise levels, the discretization into binary spikes is mostly overfitting to noise and should be avoided for real analyses. For analyses, I would use the inferred spike rate (orange).</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>



<p>The noise level <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cnu&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;nu" class="latex" /> can be used to quantitatively compare noise levels across recordings. I hope that other people can use this noise level metric <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cnu&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;nu" class="latex" /> for their work.</p>



<p>As a note of caution, <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cnu&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;nu" class="latex" />  should never be the sole criterion for data quality. Other factors like neuropil contamination, spatial resolution, movement artifacts, potential downsides of over-expression, etc. also play important roles. Low shot noise levels is not a guarantee for anything. However, high shot noise levels on the other hand are always undesirable.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41593-019-0550-9">de Vries et al. (2020; red and black)</a> describes the Allen Visual Coding Observatory dataset. It includes recordings from more than 100 mice with different transgenic backgrounds in different layers of visual-related cortices. Red dots are datasets from mice that only expressed calcium indicators in interneurons, while black dot are datasets with cortical principal neurons of different layers. The datasets are highly standardized and of low shot noise levels (standardized level of ca. 1.0), with relatively few neurons per dataset (100-200).</p>



<p>Rupprecht et al. (unpublished; green) is a small dataset in transgenic Thy-1 mice in hippocampal CA1 that I recorded as a small pilot earlier this year. The number of manually selected neurons is around 400-500, at a standardized noise level of 2.0-3.0. With virally induced expression and with higher laser power (here, I used only 20 mW), lower noise levels and higher cell counts could be easily achieved in CA1.</p>



<p><a href="https://rdcu.be/creIt">Rupprecht et al. (2021; violet)</a> is a dataset using the small dye indicator OGB-1 injected in the homolog of olfactory cortex in adult zebrafish. At low laser powers of ca. 30 mW, 800-1500 neurons were recorded simultaneously at a standardized noise level of 2.0-4.0.</p>

(2018; pink)</a> is a dataset recorded at a relatively low imaging rate (2.5 Hz), covering ca. 10,000 neurons simultaneously. The standardized noise level seems to be rather high according to my calculations.</p>



<p><a href="https://figshare.com/articles/dataset/Recording_of_19_000_neurons_across_mouse_visual_cortex_during_sparse_noise_stimuli/9505250">Pachitariu et al. (2019; black)</a> is a similar dataset that contains ca. 20,000 neurons, but at a much lower standardized noise level (4.0-5.0).</p>



<p><a href="https://www.microns-explorer.org/cortical-mm3#f-data">MICrONS et al. (2021; red)</a> is a dataset from a single mouse, each dot representing a different session. 8 imaging planes were recorded simultaneously at laser powers that would not damage the tissue, in order to preserve the brain for later slicing, with the ultimate goal to image the ultrastructure using electron microscopes. The number of simultaneously imaged neurons comes close to 10,000, resulting in a relatively high standardized noise level of 7.0-10.0.</p>



<p>The black line indicates how the noise level scales with the number of neurons.

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/brain-implant-severe-depression-activity-stimulation">A custom brain implant lifted a woman’s severe depression</a></h4>

              
                <p>A personalized brain implant eased the crushing symptoms of a woman’s severe depression, allowing her to once again see the beauty of the world. “It’s like my lens on the world changed,” said Sarah, the research volunteer who requested to be identified by her first name only.</p>



<p>The technology, described October 4 in <em>Nature Medicine</em>, brings researchers closer to understanding how to <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/brain-electric-implants-treat-depression-closer-reality">detect and change brain activity</a> in ultraprecise ways (<em>SN: 2/10/19</em>).</p>



<p>The device was bespoke; it was built specifically for Sarah’s brain. The details of the new system may not work as a treatment for many other people, says Alik Widge, a psychiatrist and neural engineer at the University of Minnesota in Minneapolis. Still, the research is “a really significant piece of work,” he says, because it points out a way to study how brain activity goes awry in depression.</p>



<p>Researchers at the University of California, San Francisco implanted temporary thin wire electrodes into Sarah’s brain. The 36-year-old woman had suffered from severe depression for years. These electrodes allowed researchers to monitor the brain activity that corresponded to Sarah’s depression symptoms — a pattern that the researchers could use as a biomarker, a signpost of trouble to come. In Sarah’s case, a particular sign emerged: a fast brain wave called a gamma wave in her amygdala, a brain structure known to be involved in emotions.&nbsp;</p>





<p>With this biomarker in hand, the researchers then figured out where to stimulate the brain to interrupt Sarah’s distressing symptoms. A region called the ventral capsule/ventral striatum, or VC/VS, seemed to be the key. That’s not surprising; previous research suggests the region is involved with feeling good and other emotions. When researchers applied tiny jolts of electrical current to this region, Sarah’s mood improved. “We could learn the road map of Sarah’s brain in a way that we could really improve her depression symptoms,” Katherine Scangos of UCSF said in a Sept. 30 news briefing.</p>



<p>During this mapping phase of the experiment, Sarah felt joy when the right spot was stimulated. “I laughed out loud,” she said in the briefing. “This was the first time I had spontaneously laughed and smiled where it wasn’t faked or forced in five years.”</p>

<p>Surgeons then implanted a more permanent device into Sarah’s brain last June. Scientists programmed the device to detect when gamma signals were high in Sarah’s amygdala, and respond with a tiny jolt to her VC/VS. This happened about 300 times a day. The stimulation was calibrated so Sarah didn’t feel any zaps, but she said they left her feeling a little more energetic.</p>



<p>The research paper describes <a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41591-021-01480-w">Sarah’s improvements as the technology did its work</a> in her head over two months; it’s unclear how long the benefits might last, though she’s now had the device implanted for over a year. “As time has gone on, it’s been this virtuous cycle, a spiral upwards,” Sarah said. “Everything has gotten easier and easier and easier.”</p>



<p>The approach used by the UCSF researchers required a lot of sophisticated imaging and machine learning technology. That complexity may prevent it from being a wider treatment, cautions Helen Mayberg, a neurologist at Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai in New York City.</p>



<p>Still, the results — which add to a variety of ways to detect and change problematic brain activity — contain valuable information about how depression takes hold of a brain, and how brain stimulation can change that, says Mayberg, whose research has helped build and refine the field of deep brain stimulation for mood disorders. “What we all want to know is, ‘How does this work?’”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/quantum-computer-error-correction-multiple-qubits-detect-mistakes">Scientists are one step closer to error-correcting quantum computers</a></h4>

              
                <p>Mistakes happen — especially in quantum computers. The fragile quantum bits, or qubits, that make up the machines are notoriously error-prone, but now scientists have shown that they can fix the flubs.</p>



<p>Computers that harness the rules of quantum mechanics show promise for making <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/quantum-computers-are-about-get-real">calculations</a> far out of reach for standard computers (<em>SN: 6/29/17</em>). But without a <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/quantum-computers-hype-supremacy-error-correction-problems">mechanism for fixing the computers’ mistakes</a>, the answers that a quantum computer spits out could be gobbledygook (<em>SN: 6/22/20</em>).</p>



<p>Combining the power of multiple qubits into one can <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-021-03928-y">solve the error woes</a>, researchers report October 4 in <em>Nature</em>. Scientists used nine qubits to make a single, improved qubit called a logical qubit, which, unlike the individual qubits from which it was made, can be probed to check for mistakes.</p>



<p>“This is a key demonstration on the path to build a large-scale quantum computer,” says quantum physicist Winfried Hensinger of the University of Sussex in&nbsp;Brighton, England, who was not involved in the new study.</p>





<p>Still, that path remains a long one, Hensinger says. To do complex calculations, scientists will have to dramatically scale up the number of qubits in the machines. But now that scientists have shown that they can keep errors under control, he says, “there’s nothing fundamentally stopping us to build a useful quantum computer.”</p>



<p>In a logical qubit, information is stored redundantly. That allows researchers to check and fix mistakes in the data. “If a piece of it goes missing, you can reconstruct it from the other pieces, like Voldemort,” says quantum physicist David Schuster of the University of Chicago, who was not involved with the new research. (The <em>Harry Potter</em> villain kept his soul safe by concealing it in multiple objects called Horcruxes.)</p>



<p>In the new study, four additional, auxiliary qubits interfaced with the logical qubit, in order to identify errors in its data. Future quantum computers could make calculations using logical qubits in place of the original, faulty qubits, repeatedly checking and fixing any errors that crop up.</p>



<p>To make their logical qubit, the researchers used a technique called a Bacon-Shor code, applying it to qubits made of ytterbium ions hovering above an ion-trapping chip inside a vacuum, which are manipulated with lasers. The researchers also designed sequences of operations so that errors don’t multiply uncontrollably, what’s known as “fault tolerance.”</p>



<p>Thanks to those efforts, the new logical qubit had a lower error rate than that of the most flawed components that made it up, says quantum physicist Christopher Monroe of the University of Maryland in College Park and Duke University.</p>



<p>However, the team didn’t quite complete the full process envisioned for error correction. While the computer detected the errors that arose, the researchers didn’t correct the mistakes and continue on with computation. Instead, they fixed errors after the computer was finished. In a full-fledged example, scientists would detect and correct errors multiple times on the fly.</p>



<p>Demonstrating quantum error correction is a necessity for building useful quantum computers. “It’s like achieving criticality with [nuclear] fission,” Schuster says. Once that nuclear science barrier <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/blog/context/anniversary-first-controlled-nuclear-chain-reaction">was passed in 1942</a>, it led to technologies like nuclear power and atomic bombs (<em>SN: 11/29/17</em>).</p>



<p>As quantum computers gradually draw closer to practical usefulness, companies are investing in the devices. Technology companies such as <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/quantum-computing-steps-forward-50-qubit-prototype">IBM</a>, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/google-quantum-computer-supremacy-claim">Google</a> and <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/quantum-computers-go-silicon">Intel</a> host major quantum computing endeavors. On October 1, a quantum computing company cofounded by Monroe, <a href="https://ionq.com/news/october-01-2021-ionq-listed-on-nyse">called IonQ</a>, went public; Monroe spoke to <em>Science News</em> while on a road trip to ring the opening bell at the New York Stock Exchange.</p>



<p>The new result suggests that full-fledged quantum error correction is almost here, says coauthor Kenneth Brown, a quantum engineer also at Duke University. “It really shows that we can get all the pieces together and do all the steps.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/nobel-prize-2021-physiology-medicine-julius-patapoutian-temperature-touch">Discovering how we sense temperature and touch wins the 2021 medicine Nobel Prize</a></h4>

              
                <p>Some touching research took the 2021 Nobel Prize in physiology or medicine. David Julius of the University of California, San Francisco and Ardem Patapoutian of the Scripps Research Institute in La Jolla, Calif., were awarded the prize October 4 for their research to identify sensors on nerve cells that detect heat, cold and pressure.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>The laureates discovered proteins called receptors that turn the burning heat from chili peppers or a hot stove, menthol’s cooling sensation or the pressure from a hug into nerve signals that can be sent to the brain. Those proteins are crucial to the sense of touch and for feeling pain.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Recognizing basic research on touch is important because “it’s such an elemental function of the nervous system, which is how we react with our environment,” says Walter Koroshetz, director of the U.S. National Institute of Neurological Diseases and Stroke in Bethesda, Md.</p>



<p>The temperature sensors warn of danger from fire or extreme cold, said Abdel El Manira, a neuroscientist and a member of the Nobel Assembly of the Karolinska Institute, which awards the physiology or medicine prize.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>





<p>Touch receptors are important for feeling where our body parts are in space. “Without them, we would not be able to stand. We would not be able to touch or feel our surroundings,” El Manira said. “Over the last year, we’ve been social distancing from one another. We have missed the sense of touch, the sense of the warmth we get from one another like during a hug.”</p>



<p>Despite its importance, “touch is perhaps the sense that people take mostly for granted,” Patapoutian said during a news conference.</p>



<p>Scientists had been searching for touch and temperature receptors for many years before Julius and Patapoutian began their work, Koroshetz said. “Everybody knew [the receptors] were there, but nobody could find them,” he says. Then the two laureates came up with some clever ways to probe for the elusive proteins.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Julius, a biochemist and molecular physiologist and Howard Hughes Medical Institute trustee, used capsaicin, the compound that gives chili peppers their heat, to discover receptor proteins that allow people to feel chili’s burn. At the time, he didn&#8217;t know that the receptor, TRPV1, also responds to heat, he said during a news conference. That discovery came later. </p>



<p>&#8220;Some of the great advances &#8230; in medicine started off with people just following their curiosity, without knowing in advance that they could one day be useful,&#8221; Julius said.</p>



<p>The protein is an ion channel, a type of molecular gate nestled in a cell’s membrane that opens or closes to control the flow of charged atoms or molecules into or out of the cell. In this case, when TRPV1 encounters capsaicin or heat, it opens, allowing charged calcium ions into the cell. That flood of calcium triggers electrical signals that are sent to the brain to warn of hot stuff.</p>



<p>Exactly how small changes in the protein’s shape allow it to communicate to the brain small differences in temperature, such as sensing when a room gets a few degrees warmer than usual, is still a mystery that Julius hopes to solve, he said.</p>



<p>Julius used the winter-fresh compound menthol to uncover TRPM8, a <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/cool-discovery-menthol-triggers-cold-sensing-protein">cold-sensing receptor protein</a> (<em>SN: 2/13/02</em>). Working independently, Patapoutian, a neuroscientist and a Howard Hughes Medical Institute investigator,  simultaneously discovered that receptor.</p>



<p>After spending about a year poking nerve cells in lab dishes, Patapoutian also discovered a receptor protein, PIEZO1, that opens in response to mechanical pressure. That protein, named after the Greek word for pressure, and another called <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/blog/science-ticker/main-protein-sensing-touch-identified-mammals">PIEZO2</a> allow people to feel touch (<em>SN: 12/4/14</em>).&nbsp;</p>



<p>PIEZO2 is the receptor on nerve cells in the skin called <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/role-merkels">Merkel cells that sense light touches</a> and caresses (<em>SN: 6/18/09</em>). It also <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/force-detecting-protein-senses-when-lungs-fill-air">helps nerves in the lungs keep the organs from overinflating</a> and is important for bladder and bowel functions (<em>SN: 12/21/16</em>). &nbsp; Children who lack PIEZO2 have balance problems and can’t feel where their limbs are, Koroshetz says. “They have to look to see where their fingers are when they reach out to grab something.”&nbsp; Abnormal pressure sensing may contribute to glaucoma and high blood pressure, too. PIEZO1 also is involved in regulating iron levels in the blood.</p>

<p>Touch and temperature receptors may also be involved in processing pain. But despite the potential for drug development, pharmaceutical companies have struggled to develop new treatments using these channels, says Gary Lewin, whose lab at the Max Delbrück Center for Molecular Medicine in Berlin studies the molecular physiology of somatic sensation.</p>



<p>A major stumbling block comes from the fact that drugs targeting TRPV1, the receptor involved in sensing heat, tend to induce fever. Other closely related receptors may be more promising, says Lewin. “Both discoveries really boosted the field of pain research. But we’re really at the beginning — there’s a huge amount still to be discovered.” Treatments based on these receptors could provide an alternative to addictive pain medication, like opioids.</p>



<p>Because the touch receptors are involved in so many body processes, treatments aimed at them will need to be localized, such as with skin patches or delivering medication directly to the affected organ, Patapoutian said.</p>



<p>Julius and Patapoutian will split the prize of 10 million Swedish kronor, or more than $1.1 million.</p>



<p>Unlisted numbers and cell phones set on mute meant the Nobel committee had to track down the winners through relatives. Julius learned of the award through a sister-in-law. Patapoutian got a call from his 94-year-old father relaying the message. “I guess even if you have ‘do not disturb’ [on], people in your favorites can still call you,” he said. “It ended up being a very special moment.”</p>

                <p><em>By </em><a href="https://twitter.com/E_Barratt">Emma L. Barratt</a></p>



<p>You may be aware of misophonia — an automatic, intense hatred of certain types of sounds, such as chewing, tapping, and breathing, to name a few. Misophonia entered mainstream awareness relatively recently, but hot on its heels is an extremely similar condition which relates not to sound, but to movement: misokinesia.</p>



<p>There are several well-established online support groups for those who relate to having strong negative affective responses to certain types of stimuli — typically small, repetitive movements, such as leg shaking or finger tapping. And, while it appears to be widespread, there has been a lack of dedicated research into the phenomenon — until now.</p>



<p>To properly introduce this under-recognised condition, Sumeet Jaswal and her colleagues based at the University of British Columbia <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-021-96430-4">recently published a set of studies</a> in <em>Scientific Reports</em> which aimed to establish key facts about the prevalence of misokinesia and what may cause it.</p>



<span id="more-44013"></span>



<p>In order to get a feel for the prevalence of misokinesia, as well as the viability of future studies, the team first conducted a pilot study. A total of 2751 undergraduates from the university’s psychology department were recruited for an online study in which they were asked two yes/no questions. The first, which aimed to measure the prevalence of misokinesia sensitivities, asked: “<em>Do you ever have strong negative feelings, thoughts, or physical reactions when seeing or viewing other peoples&#8217; fidgeting or repetitive movements (e.g., seeing someone&#8217;s foot shaking, fingers tapping, or gum chewing)?” </em>The second question was similar, but instead probed the sounds made by these kinds of actions; common triggers for the sound-related misophonia.</p>



<p>In total, 38.8% of students responded that yes, they did experience the described sensitivity to certain movements. The prevalence of misophonia sensitivites appeared to be higher, with 51.1% of students reporting that they related to the given description. Interestingly, female participants reported misokinesia sensitivities significantly more than their male counterparts (43.1% vs 24.7%, respectively), and there was a high level of overlap between those who reported sensitivity to sounds and movements. Similar patterns are seen in clinical populations with misophonia, which the authors interpreted to indicate the validity of their pair of questions.</p>



<p>This potentially high prevalence was taken as a green light to proceed to two more in-depth studies, the first of which looked at confirming these sensitivity prevalence rates and extending into two areas: the individual differences in misokinesia, and whether there was an association with heightened visual-attentional sensitivities.</p>



<p>In order to measure the presence of misokinesia sensitivities, which as of yet has no standardised measure, the researchers repurposed the previously established Misophonia Assessment Questionnaire (MpAQ) to measure sensitivity to visual, rather than auditory, stimuli. Both this Misokinesia Assessment Questionnaire (MkAQ) and the MpAQ were completed by 689 participants, alongside two measures of behavioural attention.</p>



<p>The first of these attentional measures asked participants to detect a target at a fixation point while ignoring brief moving distractor stimuli in the peripheries. This gave the team an idea of how well participants could &#8220;block out&#8221; distractions to their attention. The second test of attention, in contrast, measured how well participants were able to attend to stimuli in to their peripheries.</p>



<p>Analyses found that a huge 60.3% of the sample for this study experienced misokinesia sensitivities to some extent, in line with the estimates provided by the pilot study, and the team classified about one third of participants as having “high” misokinesia sensitivies. When it came to misophonia, 70.8% of participants experienced some level of sensitivities, and 37.8% had scores indicative of both misokinesia and misophonia, further suggesting co-morbidity between the two conditions.</p>



<p>However, the results of the attentional tasks provided no evidence that people with misokinesia show any differences from the control group in visuospatial attention. These participants were no more easily distracted by movement in their peripheries and were just as able to orient attention to items in the peripheries as those without misokinesia sensitivities.</p>



<p>In all, data collected in this first study suggest that misokinesia is a widespread phenomenon within non-clinical populations. The wide range in scores on the MkAQ suggest that it is not necessarily a binary phenomenon, but may be a spectrum with many individuals experiencing mild sensitivities, and others, much more intrusive ones. It also appears that reflexive visual attention is not a particular issue for those with misokinesia.</p>



<p>The second study in this paper looked at prevalence of misokinesia senstitivies in an older, more diverse population of 765 participants recruited from Amazon Mechanical Turk (Mturk).</p>



<p>In total, 38.1% of female participants and 35.3% or male participants responded <em>yes</em> to the same misokinesia question used in the first study, while 69.3% of females and 76.6% of males had MkAQ scores indicative of what this study determined to be low to high levels of misokinesia sensitivites. In fact, a massive 67.3% had scores suggesting high levels of misokinesia — many more than in the first study.</p>



<p>These findings suggest that misokinesia is not only prevalent within the wider population (or, at least in those with an MTurk account), but also that the severity of sensitivity may increase with age, or differ by sex or ethnicity. This may be addressed in future research in other demographics that are less strongly White and male.</p>



<p>This paper paints a picture of misokinesia being quite prevalent in the general population. The authors are also keen to emphasise that while their studies into visual attention showed null results, differences in visual attention among this population could still exist. It’s possible that those who experience misokinesia are well practiced at controlling their visual attention, which may have made their performances more typical, or that the stimuli included weren’t appropriate for measuring the condition. It’s also possible that, given the relatively prevalent co-morbidity with misophonia, those sudden negative reactions to movement may be tied to heightened reactivity. Some misophonia research has also pointed towards the possibility that <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2021/08/17/excessive-mirroring-could-explain-why-people-with-misophonia-react-strongly-to-sounds-of-chewing-or-drinking/">“over-mirroring” in the brain’s motor areas may be the root cause of discomfort for suffers</a>; it’s possible that misokinesia may stem from this, too. These are all potentially fruitful avenues for future research.</p>



<p>As this is a newly established topic, the measures used within these studies were somewhat exploratory, and are likely to have slightly suboptimal levels of validity. For example, it is unknown whether the MpQA’s adaptation into the MkQA really captures the experience of misokinesia. Additionally, in this study the cut-off points to classify people as having “no”, “low”, and “high” misokinesia were chosen so as to divide participants into three relatively equal groups; these thresholds of severity will require further study to verify. Further explorations, potentially including qualitative measures, will be needed to truly establish misokinesia as a research topic. Even so, this first paper represents a solid first step.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coronavirus-covid-antiviral-pill-merck-molnupiravir-hospitalization-death">A new antiviral pill cuts COVID-19 hospitalization and death rates</a></h4>

              
                <p>An at-home pill against coronavirus halves the chance that people newly diagnosed with COVID-19 will land in the hospital or die, early results released by the drug’s developer indicate.</p>



<p>The pill, an antiviral drug called molnupiravir, was tested against a placebo in people at high risk of developing severe disease. Of the 377 people who got the placebo, 14.1 percent, or 53, were hospitalized within 29 days of starting the trial, with eight dying. By comparison, 7.3 percent, or 28, of the 385 patients who got the drug were hospitalized in the same time period. <a href="https://www.merck.com/news/merck-and-ridgebacks-investigational-oral-antiviral-molnupiravir-reduced-the-risk-of-hospitalization-or-death-by-approximately-50-percent-compared-to-placebo-for-patients-with-mild-or-moderat/">None died</a>, officials with the pharmaceutical company Merck announced October 1 in a news release. Similar numbers of people taking the drug and the placebo reported side effects, but fewer people in the drug group stopped treatment because of those side effects. The news release did not describe what those side effects were.</p>



<p>About 40 percent of participants in the interim trial were infected with the gamma, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/delta-variant-studies-cdc-coronavirus-covid-pandemic">delta</a> or mu variants of the coronavirus (<em>SN: 7/30/21</em>). Molnupiravir was as effective against those variants as it was against earlier versions of the virus, the company reported. Full results from the study aren’t yet available and other scientists have not reviewed the data.</p>

<p>Finding <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coronavirus-covid-19-why-early-treatment-drugs">drugs that can work early in an infection</a> hasn’t been easy (<em>SN: 7/27/21</em>). Currently, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/covid-19-coronavirus-antibodies-lab-treatment-immune-system">only some lab-made antibodies are authorized</a> for newly diagnosed COVID-19 patients who are not sick enough to go to the hospital (<em>SN: 9/22/20</em>). Those antibodies must be given through an IV, making it difficult for some people to get treatment.</p>



<p>“Antiviral treatments that can be taken at home to keep people with COVID-19 out of the hospital are critically needed,” Wendy Holman, chief executive officer of Ridgeback Biotherapeutics said in the news release. Ridgeback and Merck have partnered to develop molnupiravir and will share profits.</p>



<p>The most exciting aspect of the drug is that it can be taken in pill form, rather than as an <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/covid-19-coronavirus-remdesivir-first-drug-recovery-treatment">intravenous infusion like remdesivir</a>, says Mark Denison, a virologist at Vanderbilt University Medical Center in Nashville (<em>SN: 4/29/20</em>). He did much of the early lab testing of molnupiravir, previously known as <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coronavirus-covid-19-new-early-treatments">EIDD-2801</a> or MK-4482, but was not involved in the clinical trials (<em>SN: 8/24/20</em>).</p>



<p>In some of the children Denison treats as the director of pediatric infectious diseases at VUMC, remdesivir treatment comes too late. The same is true for many adults hospitalized with COVID-19. “At that point, why don’t you just pour the drug on their heads instead of giving it to them IV, because you’ve already moved past the window where it can be effective.” Delaying antiviral treatment is akin to waiting to give antibiotics until a wound is infected down to the bone, he says.</p>

<p>Giving antivirals early in an infection has a chance of stopping the virus before it can do much damage or prod the immune system to overreact. Molnupiravir could potentially be prescribed as soon a patient gets a positive COVID-19 test result, perhaps heading off floods of COVID-19 patients that are overwhelming medical systems as the highly transmissible delta variant circulates. In combination with vaccines, an effective early treatment might help get the pandemic under control.</p>



<p>Interim results from the molnupiravir study were so encouraging, an independent review panel decided to stop the global trial early. Merck said it plans to seek emergency use authorization for the drug from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and will apply for authorization in other countries as well.</p>



<p>“To stop a trial for futility is pretty common, when a drug isn’t working or when it’s showing a negative effect,” Denison says. “But to stop a trial because of efficacy, because the drug is working so well is really unusual. He adds, “I’m amazed but not surprised” that the antiviral performed well in humans. In his experiments with cells grown in lab dishes and in animal tests, “I was blown away by its effectiveness against multiple coronaviruses.”</p>



<p>Like the FDA-approved antiviral remdesivir, molnupiravir mimics building blocks of the coronavirus’s genetic material, RNA. The fake building blocks interfere with the polymerase enzyme the coronavirus uses to copy its RNA. But the two drugs work differently. Remdesivir is a delayed stop sign, Denison says. When it is inserted into a growing strand of RNA, it slows the polymerase, eventually causing it to grind to a halt, much like a car entering an intersection as the traffic light turns yellow may stop in the middle of the intersection, he says. Molnupiravir instead pockmarks the RNA with many mutations, causing the breakdown of the polymerase and other viral components, much like a pothole-strewn road can cause a car to break down. Those mutation potholes don’t just stop the RNA-copying enzyme, they also cause damage to other proteins the virus needs to infect cells and replicate.</p>





<p>Viruses can develop resistance to some antivirals, like the anti-influenza drug osteltamavir, sold under the brand name Tamiflu. But with molnupiravir, “resistance mutations can’t emerge because the drug makes too many other damaging mutations,” Denison says.</p>



<p>Merck says it can make as many as 10 million doses of molnupiravir by the end of the year. The company has entered into agreements with generic drug makers in more than 100 low and middle-income countries to produce the drug as well.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/marie-antoinette-letters-ink-analysis-hidden-words-censor">Ink analysis reveals Marie Antoinette’s letters’ hidden words and who censored them</a></h4>

              
                <p>In a world torn apart by the French Revolution, doomed Queen Marie Antoinette exchanged secret letters with a rumored lover. Someone later censored them — and now scientists know who.</p>



<p>Chemical analyses of the ink <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.abg4266">reveal not only the obscured words, but also the identity of the censor</a>, researchers report October 1 in <em>Science Advances</em>.</p>



<p>From June 1791 to August 1792, as Marie Antoinette and the rest of the royal family were confined to Paris’ Tuileries Palace following an escape attempt, the queen managed a clandestine correspondence with Swedish Count Axel von Fersen.</p>



<p>Whether the correspondents exchanged words of love or state secrets was a longstanding mystery, says Anne Michelin, a chemist at the National Museum of Natural History in Paris. Michelin and colleagues unraveled this mystery using X-ray fluorescence spectroscopy.</p>



<p>XRF, a noninvasive technique, works by shooting an X-ray beam at a sample, kicking the atoms in the sample into a higher-energy state. The sample then emits its own X-rays along a spectrum characteristic of its elemental makeup. With XRF, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/archaeopteryx-fossil-seen-new-light">paleontologists have scrutinized fossils</a> and <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/blog/science-ticker/x-rays-reveal-portrait-hiding-beneath-degas-masterpiece">art restorers have found hidden paintings</a> (<em>SN: 5/10/10</em>; <em>SN: 8/4/16</em>).</p>

<p>Here, the researchers zoomed in on the ink. Both correspondents used common gall ink made from iron sulfate, but different inks contain different proportions of trace elements, depending on the source, Michelin says. The team scanned the letters pixel by pixel, finding consistent differences in the copper-to-iron and the zinc-to-iron ratios of the original and redacting inks. By mapping each pixel’s elemental differences onto a gray scale, the hidden words emerged — words such as &#8220;beloved,&#8221; &#8220;tender friend&#8221; and &#8220;madly.”</p>



<p>As for the censor, it was von Fersen himself, Michelin says. The count was known to make copies of Marie Antoinette’s letters — and the ink used for the redactions was a match to those copies.</p>



<p>How much of their relationship was personal versus political may never be known, she adds, but we do know that “he kept these letters, even though it was risky for him.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2021/10/01/left-wing-authoritarianism-is-real-and-needs-to-be-taken-seriously-in-political-psychology-study-argues/">Left-Wing Authoritarianism Is Real And Needs To Be Taken Seriously In Political Psychology, Study Argues</a></h4>

              
                <p><em>By</em> <a href="https://emmayoung.net/">Emma Young</a></p>



<p>Authoritarianism has been well-studied by psychologists. Well, right-wing authoritarianism has. In fact, as that’s typically the only type that’s studied, you might be forgiven for thinking that’s what authoritarianism <em>is</em>. The very idea of <em>left-wing</em> authoritarianism (LWA) has received not only little academic attention, but a lot of scepticism from psychologists. “I think I have not found any authoritarians on the left because if there ever were any, most of them have dried up and blown away….” wrote Bob Altemeyer, <a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/record/1997-08573-000">pioneer of work on right-wing authoritarianism</a>, in 1996.</p>



<p>But as Thomas Costello at Emory University and colleagues write in their <a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2021-74485-001">new paper</a> in the <em>Journal of Personality and Social Psychology: Personality Processes and Individual Differences</em>, “From Maoist China to the Khmer Rouge (and perhaps even the French Reign of Terror), history abounds with examples of LWA at the broader societal level, rendering psychology’s inability to identify left-wing authoritarians puzzling.”</p>



<p>Puzzling is right. Perhaps predominantly left-leaning researchers have been unwilling to even go there…. But in their new paper, Costello and his colleagues absolutely go there. They conclude that LWA does indeed exist, and they define not only its characteristics but the characteristics of the people who subscribe to it. They also reveal substantial similarities between authoritarians on the political right and the left.</p>



<span id="more-44007"></span>



<p>First, the team used a bottom-up approach to devise a scale to get at LWA. As well as scouring research papers for items that might relate to authoritarianism, they solicited ideas for items from psychologists, political scientists and philosophers. Using multiple batches of online participants, the team gradually whittled down and revised these items. They ended up with 39 items that reflected three conceptually distinct dimensions of LWA. I’ll take the definitions directly from the paper:&nbsp;</p>



<ul><li><strong>Antihierarchical Aggression</strong> &#8211; <em>the belief that those currently in power should be punished, the established order should be overthrown, and that extreme actions, such as political violence, are justifiable to achieve these aims.</em><br></li><li><strong>Anticonventionalism</strong> &#8211; <em>the rejection of traditional values, a moral absolutism concerning progressive values and concomitant dismissal of conservatives as inherently immoral, and a need for political homogeneity in one’s social environment.</em><br></li><li><strong>Top-Down Censorship</strong> &#8211; <em>preferences for the use of governmental and institutional authority to quash opposition and bar offensive and intolerant speech.</em></li></ul>



<p>Looking over that list, I certainly know some people who I’m sure think of themselves as being extremely liberal but who would score pretty highly on the anti-conventionalism dimension, at least.</p>



<p>The researchers then ran studies using fresh batches of participants and an impressive array of self-report scales to look at everything from personality, to mood, to cognition. They found a few differences between left-wing and right-wing authoritarians. People who scored highly on the LWA scale reported more negative emotions and were more neurotic than average (unlike RWAs). They were also more likely to report schadenfreude. The RWAs, meanwhile, scored higher for unjustified certainty in their beliefs and confirmatory thinking (a tendency to favour information that supports your beliefs). RWA was also more strongly linked to cognitive rigidity and low openness, as well as a lower than typical belief in science.</p>



<p>However, there were a <em>lot</em> more similarities between the two groups than differences. So much so, that it seems there is a shared constellation of traits “that might be considered the ‘heart’ of authoritarianism”, the team writes. These shared traits include (and again, I’ll quote directly from the paper): a “preference for social uniformity, prejudice towards different others, willingness to wield group authority to coerce behaviour, cognitive rigidity, aggression and punitiveness towards perceived enemies, outsized concern for hierarchy and moral absolutism.”</p>



<p>In terms of potentially dangerous implications for others, both left- and ring-wing authoritarianism was linked to the endorsement of political violence; but for the LWAs, that was violence directed <em>at</em> the state (violent protests, for example), whereas for the RWAs, it was <em>in support of </em>the state (supporting police crackdowns, say).</p>



<p>As well as analysing this self-report data, the team ran a study designed to look at LWA and actual behaviour. Online participants selected the difficulty level of a set of puzzles that they believed they were giving to another participant to complete. Before they chose the puzzles, though, they were shown what they were told was the Facebook profile of this ‘partner’. Those who’d scored highly for LWA ‘punished’ partners with right-wing profiles with harder puzzles and ‘helped’ those with left-wing profiles with easier puzzles. This was the case even when participants’ political ideology was taken into account, showing that LWA can be linked to actual aggressive behaviour towards the political outgroup above and beyond any effects of political ideology, the team concluded.</p>



<p>None of these studies were on groups of participants who were representative of a general population, however. So the researchers ran a fresh study on 834 who were selected to be representative of the population of the US. Again, they found large correlations between LWA scores and dogmatism, as well as schadenfreude, moral disengagement and violence towards out-groups. This included actual participation in the use of force for a political cause over the preceding five years. It also included support of violent group action during protests against police brutality towards Black Americans over the summer of 2020, in the wake of the murder of George Floyd.&nbsp;</p>



<p>All in all, then, the team present a lot of studies — and a lot of analyses. There are some limitations to the work, however. Because of the nature of the scales, it’s not possible to tell whether right-wing authoritarians are more authoritarian than the left-wing type, or vice versa, say. Also, the route to LWA may be more well-meaning than the route to RWA, the researchers write; for example, someone who wants passionately to challenge inequality in society may end up thinking violent protest is the only option. “Any similarities across LWA and RWA notwithstanding, we endorse no claims of motivational or moral equivalence (or lack thereof) across the two constructs at present,” they write.</p>



<p>Their body of results surely suggests, though, that arguments that the search for LWA should be abandoned should themselves be abandoned. In fact, excluding left-wing features from studies of authoritarianism “has limited the kinds of knowledge we can produce as psychological scientists,” the team argues. And given the relevance of authoritarianism to politics, globally, and to how societies respond to and fight for change, surely it’s high time for that to shift.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/children-climate-change-generation-burden-extreme-heat">2020 babies may suffer up to seven times as many extreme heat waves as 1960s kids</a></h4>

              
                <p>The kids are not all right. Children born in 2020 <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.abi7339">could live through seven times as many extreme heat waves</a> as people born in 1960.</p>



<p>That&#8217;s&nbsp;the projected&nbsp;generational disparity&nbsp;if global greenhouse gas emissions are curbed by the amount currently promised by the world’s nations, climate scientist&nbsp;Wim Thiery&nbsp;of Vrije Universiteit Brussel in Belgium and colleagues report September 26 in&nbsp;<em>Science</em>. Under current&nbsp;pledges,&nbsp;Earth’s average temperature is expected to&nbsp;increase by&nbsp;about 2.4 degrees Celsius relative to preindustrial times by 2100. While the older generation will experience an average of about four extreme heat waves during their lifetime, the younger generation could experience an average of about 30 such heat waves, the researchers say.</p>



<p>More stringent reductions that would limit&nbsp;warming to just&nbsp;1.5 degrees C would shrink — but not erase — the disparity: Children born in 2020 could still experience four times as many extreme heat waves as people born in 1960.</p>



<p>Scientists have previously outlined how climate change <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/climate-change-un-ipcc-report-humans">has already amped up extreme weather events</a> around the globe, and how those climate impacts are projected to increase as the world continues to warm (<em>SN: 8/9/21</em>). The new study is the first to specifically quantify how much more exposed younger generations will be to those events.</p>



<p>An average child born in 2020 also will experience two times as many wildfires, 2.8 times as many river floods, 2.6 times as many droughts and about three times as many crop failures as a child born 60 years earlier, under climate scenarios based on current pledges. That exposure to extreme events becomes even higher in certain parts of the world: In the Middle East, for example, 2020 children will see up to 10 times as many heat waves as the older cohort, the team found.</p>



<p>With this possible grim future in mind, student climate activists in the #FridaysforFuture movement have been <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/youth-climate-change-activists-heat-waves-top-science-stories-2019-yir">among the most powerful voices of protest in recent years</a> (<em>SN: 12/16/19</em>). Thiery and colleagues note that these findings come at a crucial time, as world leaders prepare to gather in Glasgow, Scotland, in late October for the 2021 United Nations Climate Change Conference to negotiate new pledges to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.</p>

                Scientific Reports is taking heat on social media and from data sleuths for publishing a paper implying that the Biblical story of the destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah might have been the retelling of the devastation wrought by an exploding asteroid in or around the year 1,650 BCE.&#160; To the lay reader &#8212; and to &#8230; <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2021/10/01/criticism-engulfs-paper-claiming-an-asteroid-destroyed-biblical-sodom-and-gomorrah/" class="more-link">Continue reading <span class="screen-reader-text">Criticism engulfs paper claiming an asteroid destroyed Biblical Sodom and Gomorrah</span></a>

The subject was a young woman about to graduate from college. As far as she could tell, she's always had these experiences, and for most of her life she didn't know they were unusual. This <a href="https://neurocritic.blogspot.com/2019/06/the-shock-of-unknown-in-aphantasia.html" target="_blank">surprise</a> upon discovering the uniqueness of one's one internal experience is similar to what is reported by many contemporary individuals with less typical phenomenology, such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aphantasia" target="_blank">aphantasia</a> (the inability to generate visual images).</p><p>Pierce noted that the subject was anosmic (<span class="css-901oao css-16my406 r-poiln3 r-bcqeeo r-qvutc0">had a loss of smell), although this was not formally tested. Nonetheless, he observed:</span></p><p><span class="css-901oao css-16my406 r-poiln3 r-bcqeeo r-qvutc0"></span></p><blockquote>Coffee burning upon a stove is not noticed, though she may be close by. Camphor placed in the nostrils gives only a stinging sensation. Ammonia can be sniffed without discomfort. And, as with all anosmics, foods are discriminated on the basis of the pure taste qualities, or by the characters of texture, astringency, and so on, which any food-complex may possess. These sensory defects are worth noting for their possible significance in connection with the theory of this special case of synæsthesia.</blockquote><p>&nbsp;<br /><br />Some aspects of the report were rather quaint by modern standards (e.g., the first person narration), but others were quite prescient.<br /></p><blockquote>But what evidence have we that an actual case of synæsthesia is here being reported, and not a case of artificial association due to a lively dramatic fancy? This is a point that must be raised, for it is very easy to entertain a suspicion that these phenomena are essentially ungenuine. Now, of course, in matters of this kind general impressions and personal knowledge of the subject count heavily. And on both these grounds I have no hesitation in asserting my conviction that the above-cited equivalents are the expression of a genuine synæsthesia.</blockquote><p></p><p></p><p><br /><br />One key piece of evidence was the consistency of gustatory experiences associated with the same words at a later date:<br /></p><blockquote>...the equivalents possess a constancy which would hardly be possible apart from a true synæsthesia. After an interval of six months a number of words were given at random from the original list, with the result that the identical equivalents were described in almost precisely the same language.</blockquote><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Also, there was a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Somatotopic_arrangement" target="_blank">somatotopic</a>-like arrangement for some of the gustatory experiences:<br /></p><blockquote>Many of the experiences are given quite definite locations in the mouth. Thus the equivalents of <i>Ethel</i> and <i>Hall</i> (tactual) are felt at  the tip of the tongue; of <i>lox</i> (irritation) at the back of the throat; of <i>Judith</i> (salt) at the sides of the tongue; of <i>Sarah</i> (cold) on the lips; of <i>amethyst</i> (bitter) "at the back of the mouth, on the roof, where the root of the tongue seems to hit it" ...</blockquote><p></p><p>&nbsp;<br /></p>Pierce tried to discern whether similar sounds could be related to similar gustatory experiences, but that wasn't the case. Nor were they related to similarities in articulation. He still preferred a physiological explanation, yet...<br /><blockquote>In attempting to decide whether the above-cited experiences are to be explained by the physiological or by the psychological theory, we are, apparently, in no better and in no worse case than in respect to all varieties of synæsthesia. No decisive facts are at hand.</blockquote><p>&nbsp;</p><p>An interesting <a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/article-abstract/444104" target="_blank">commentary</a> in <i>JAMA</i> predated <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/?term=MRI+connectivity+synesthesia&amp;sort=date&amp;size=50" target="_blank">MRI connectivity</a> studies of synesthesia by nearly a century in its speculation about alternative brain wiring:</p><p></p><blockquote>There is little evidence one way or the other as to whether or not this phenomenon is to be explained on purely physiologic grounds, depending on a cross circuiting of the association fibers between different brain centers. </blockquote><p></p><br /><br />Pierce concludes his paper with a pithy aphorism that acknowledges the inconclusiveness of the study:<br /><blockquote><span style="color: #cc0000;"><span style="color: black;">Still, here no less than in all known cases of synaesthesis, </span><b>we can only regret that our theory is so lame while our facts are so secure.</b></span></blockquote><br /><br /> <p> <b>References</b><br /><br />Pierce AH.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/~r/plos/Blog/~3/zhqT8cxAkyg/">2021 DEI goals update</a></h4>

              
                <!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/loose.dtd">
<html><body><p>In April 2021&nbsp;we launched our dedicated <a href="https://plos.org/dei/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">DEI webpage</a> where we outline our commitment to diversity, equity, and inclusion. Our commitment not only includes how we run our organization but also extends to how we execute our mission to accelerate progress in science and medicine by leading a transformation in research communication. Truly Open Science requires direct action.</p>



<p>The <a href="https://plos.org/dei/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">DEI webpage</a> is, however, more than just the words of our commitment. It is also where we transparently share our specific <a href="https://plos.org/dei/#goals" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">DEI goals</a> in order to be held accountable to them. We&rsquo;ve committed to sharing regular progress on this blog, and this is the first of those updates. (PLOS staff will continue to write their own posts about their particular thoughts and activities around DEI, also.)</p>



<p>Some of the goals will suit incremental updates, and some suit annual reporting. We&rsquo;ll link each update below to the particular goal it relates to, and provide links when relevant. We will also be transparent about key setbacks or if we miss any targets, rather than simply glossing over these. </p>



<p><strong>Goal: Increasing the number of historically underrepresented external contributors (e.g. authors, editors, reviewers) and strategic partners.</strong></p>



<ul><li>Our journals are committed to <a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2021/04/launching-new-journals-2021/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">equitable participation</a>, and we&rsquo;re pleased with our progress to create representative editorial boards for our newly launched journals <a href="https://journals.plos.org/climate/s/editorial-board" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>PLOS Climate</em></a><em>, </em><a href="https://journals.plos.org/digitalhealth/s/editorial-board" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>PLOS Digital Health</em></a><em>, </em><a href="https://journals.plos.org/globalpublichealth/s/editorial-board" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>PLOS Global Public Health</em></a><em>, </em><a href="https://journals.plos.org/sustainabilitytransformation/s/editorial-board" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>PLOS Sustainability &amp; Transformation</em></a><em>, </em>and <a href="https://journals.plos.org/water/s/editorial-board" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>PLOS Water</em></a><em>.&nbsp;</em></li><li>We have been particularly successful with diverse representation for <a href="https://journals.plos.org/globalpublichealth/s/editorial-board" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>PLOS Global Public Health</em></a>, and at the end of this post is a video recorded with the journal&rsquo;s Co-Editors-in-Chief and Executive Editor, where they discuss how they managed to assemble this truly global and diverse editorial board.</li><li>Day 1 of our week of programming for the start of our <a href="https://plos.org/scientists-for-open-science/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Scientists for Open Science</a> campaign was dedicated to <a href="https://plos.org/event/inclusion/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Inclusion</a>.&nbsp;</li><li>We are in the final stages of drafting a survey to assess contributor diversity, which will be deployed in Q4 of 2021.</li></ul>



<p><strong>Goal: Developing editorial processes that recognize and minimize bias in the publication process, along high ethical standards.</strong></p>



<ul><li>PLOS has <a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2021/09/announcing-a-new-plos-policy-on-inclusion-in-global-research/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">instituted a new policy</a> to improve transparency in the reporting of research that is conducted in other countries or communities in order to prevent &ldquo;parachute research&rdquo; (also known as &ldquo;helicopter&rdquo; or &ldquo;neo-colonial science&rdquo;). Watch a recorded conversation, below, with some of the stakeholders who helped develop this policy.</li><li>*PLOS has formally joined the multi-publisher initiative to accelerate research culture change, coordinated by the Royal Society of Chemistry (RSC) &ndash;&nbsp; <a href="https://www.rsc.org/new-perspectives/talent/joint-commitment-for-action-inclusion-and-diversity-in-publishing/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Joint commitment for action on inclusion and diversity in publishing</a>. We had been participating and contributing from the start, but this update serves to make the collaboration official, and with pooled resources helps all publishers drive towards this goal.&nbsp;</li><li>*PLOS is also a member of the <a href="https://c4disc.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Coalition for Diversity and Inclusion in Scholarly Communications</a> (C4DISC) and as such commits to uphold its <a href="https://c4disc.org/principles/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">principles</a>.</li></ul>



<p>*A note on industry collaborations: we believe that collaborating with other publishers will help us all develop the methods and metrics to understand the diversity of our collective journals&rsquo; editorial boards, conscious of regional privacy laws and cultures, which in turn will help enable us <em>all </em>to improve diversity, equity, and inclusion.</p>

</div></figure>



<p><strong>Goal: Increasing the number of historically underrepresented employees at PLOS, with an emphasis on managerial employee roles.</strong></p>



<ul><li>Through September 2021, we have met our internal sub-goal that every PLOS Leadership Team vacancy (4 vacancies filled in 2021) has included final candidates historically underrepresented in leadership, particularly Black, Latina/o, Indigenous and transgender people. In early 2022, we will report on how this has affected hiring outcomes for 2021.</li><li>We have increased investment by more than 50% to develop our recruiting function and interview methods , which are instrumental in meaningfully changing the way we hire. In September, we conducted a leadership team retrospective on the progress we&rsquo;ve made, what the challenges are, and where we&rsquo;ll focus our efforts in 2022.</li></ul>



<p><strong>Goal: Increasing the quantifiable signals of an inclusive work environment that values divergent perspectives, encourages critical inquiry, and ensures equitable advancement and rewards.</strong></p>



<ul><li>In early 2021, we translated our ideals of &ldquo;diversity&rdquo;, &ldquo;equity&rdquo;, and &ldquo;inclusion&rdquo; into three distinct sets of competencies in which to anchor our goals and development activities</li><li>In March, every leader at PLOS set DEI goals for 2021: goals ranged from raising awareness around key issues to changing processes to produce more equitable outcomes.</li><li>Our Chief People and Equity Officer, Kristina Martin, participated in a C4DISC panel discussion &ldquo;<a href="https://c4disc.org/2021/06/15/ssp-session-the-glass-ceiling-you-dont-know-about-yet-removing-barriers-for-people-with-disabilities-at-work/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Glass Ceiling You Don&rsquo;t Know About Yet: Removing Barriers for People with (Dis)abilities at Work</a>&rdquo;</li><li>On October 12, 2021 we&rsquo;re hosting an internal PLOS &ldquo;Listening Session&rdquo; in which neurodiverse leaders share their lived experiences with Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder, Autism Spectrum Disorder, and Bipolar Disorder.&nbsp;</li><li>In November, managers and employees will have practice sessions for strategies we&rsquo;ve previously introduced to identify and reduce bias.</li><li>While barriers related to privacy, data collection and storage have prevented us from capturing broad diversity data across PLOS&rsquo; global employee population, we are working through the issues and plan to have the systems in place in 2022 to accurately capture data related to hire, retention and progression of employees at PLOS, disaggregated by identity group. In the meantime, we are collecting data for two smaller groups: the PLOS Leadership Team and our DEI Steering Committee. We will share this data in early 2022.</li></ul>



<p><strong>Goal: Increasing the publication of research that studies inequalities, racism, and inequities facing minority and/or marginalized populations (within the scope of each of our journals).</strong></p>



<ul><li>We are still looking into the best way to meaningfully feature articles across our portfolio of journals in this way, and will report in the future. In the meantime, we will share this blog post regarding the mission of <em>PLOS Global Public Health</em>, from the Co-Editors: <a href="https://speakingofmedicine.plos.org/2021/06/14/plos-global-public-health-charting-a-new-path-towards-equity-diversity-and-inclusion-in-global-health/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">PLOS Global Public Health, charting a new path towards equity, diversity and inclusion in global health</a></li></ul>

<p><strong>Probing pharaohs with X-rays</strong> — <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/probing-new-kingdom-pharaohs-x-rays"><em>Science News</em></a>, October 9, 1971</p>



<p>The 29 mummies of pharaohs and queens were examined without disturbing their present positions.… [Researchers using portable X-ray equipment] found evidence of rheumatoid inflammation of the vertebrae of Amenophis II, ruler of Egypt from 1436 to 1413 B.C…. [A queen] was buried with what was thought to be her mummified infant. But radiography of the object confirmed its identification as a mummified adolescent baboon.</p>



<h4>Update</h4>



<p>Scientists now investigate Egyptian mummies with advanced imaging devices that were <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/ct-scans-show-first-x-rayed-mummy-new-light">unavailable in 1971</a>. <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/microct-xray-ancient-animal-mummies">Micro-CT scans and virtual reality models</a> have provided detailed life history and embalming information about three animal mummies — a cat, a bird and a snake (<em>SN: 9/12/20, p.&nbsp;17</em>). 3-D printing has enabled scientists to <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/3d-printed-vocal-tract-ancient-mummy-voice-speak-beyond-grave">reconstruct the vocal tract and simulate the voice</a> of a 3,000-year-old mummified priest (<em>SN: 2/15/20, p. 14</em>). And <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/infrared-images-reveal-hidden-tattoos-egyptian-mummies">infrared scanner</a>s have revealed tattoos on seven mummies dating to about 3,000 years ago (<em>SN: 12/21/19 &amp; 1/4/20, p. 8</em>).</p>

<html><body><p>We don&rsquo;t often toot our horn at PLOS, but we&rsquo;d be remiss not to acknowledge the wonderful work our institutional partnership team has done in changing the scholarly landscape with respect to how papers are paid for. The <a href="https://www.alpsp.org/">Association of Learned and Professional Society Publishers (ALPSP)</a> honored PLOS&rsquo; work at the ALPSP annual meeting last week. The PLOS team was named co-winners for Innovation in Publishing 2021. PLOS shares this honor with <a href="https://mindscapecommons.net/login">Mindscape Commons</a> by Coherent Digital, which is the first and largest collection of Virtual Reality (VR) video content for teaching and learning in mental health.</p>



<p>PLOS journals are underpinned by our existing, and new, institutional business models that move beyond the Article Processing Charge (APC) to ensure more equitable and regionally appropriate ways to support Open Access publishing. PLOS&rsquo; institutional models are <a href="https://plos.org/resources/community-action-publishing/">Community Action Publishing (CAP)</a>, <a href="https://plos.org/resources/for-institutions/flat-fee-agreements/">Flat Fee agreement</a>, and the <a href="https://plos.org/resources/global-equity-model/">Global Equity model</a>.&nbsp; The award was specifically for Community Action Publishing, a non-APC based model that uses collective action by institutions to pay for publication fees.</p>



<p>&ldquo;Community and partnerships are built on trust and we&rsquo;re so grateful to our current and future library partners for the trust and openness they&rsquo;ve brought to developing this model,&rdquo; said Sara Rouhi, Director of Strategic Partnerships for PLOS. &ldquo;This award would also not have been possible without the amazing collaboration of our team and Raym Crow at the Chain Bridge Group, who specializes in Open Access business models.&rdquo;</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/volcano-eruptions-rainy-period-earth-climate-dinosaur-friendly">A volcano-induced rainy period made Earth’s climate dinosaur-friendly</a></h4>

              
                <p>The biggest beasts to walk the Earth had humble beginnings. The first dinosaurs were cat-sized, lurking in the shadows, just waiting for their moment. That moment came when four major pulses of volcanic activity changed the climate in a geologic blink of an eye, causing a 2-million-year-long rainy spell that coincided with dinos rising to dominance, a new study suggests.</p>



<p>Clues found in sediments buried deep beneath an ancient lake basin in China <a href="https://www.pnas.org/content/118/40/e2109895118">link the volcanic eruptions with climate swings and environmental changes</a> that created a globe-spanning hot and humid oasis in the middle of the hot and dry Triassic Period, researchers report in the Oct. 5 <em>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences</em>. During this geologically brief rainy period 234 million to 232 million years ago, called the Carnian Pluvial Episode, dinosaurs started evolving into the hulking and diverse creatures that would dominate the landscape for the next 166 million years.</p>



<p>Previous research has noted the jump in global temperatures, humidity and rainfall during this time period, as well as a changeover in land and sea life. But these studies lacked detail on what caused these changes, says Jason Hilton, a paleobotanist at the University of Birmingham in England.</p>



<p>So Hilton and his colleagues turned to a several-hundred-meter-long core of lake-bottom sediments drawn from the Jiyuan Basin for answers. The core contained four distinct layers of sediments that included volcanic ash that the team dated to between 234 million and 232 million years ago, matching the timing of the Carnian Pluvial Episode. Within those layers, the team also found mercury, a proxy for volcanic eruptions. “Mercury entered the lake from a mix of atmospheric pollution, volcanic ash and also being washed in from surrounding land that had elevated levels of mercury from volcanism,” Hilton says.</p>

<p>Further evidence for the link between volcanism and environmental change during the Carnian Pluvial Episode came from corresponding layers in the core that showed different types of carbon, indicating four massive releases of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. Finally, microfossils and pollens changed within the same core section, from species that prefer drier climates to ones that tend to grow in warm and humid climates.</p>



<p>The reconstructed history suggests that the volcanic pulses injected huge amounts of CO₂ into the atmosphere, says coauthor Jacopo Dal Corso, a geologist at the University of Leeds in England. That boosted temperatures and intensified the hydrologic cycle, enhancing rainfall and increasing runoff into lakes, he says. At the same time, terrestrial plants evolved, with humidity-loving flora becoming predominant. As the rains created wet environments, turtles, large amphibians called metoposaurids — and dinosaurs — began to thrive.</p>



<p>Together, these diverse lines of evidence reveal that the Carnian Pluvial Episode was actually four distinct pulses of significant environmental change — each triggered by massive volcanic eruptions, Dal Corso says.</p>

<p>The mercury and carbon data together suggest the increase in mercury came from a “major source of volcanism that was capable of impacting the global carbon cycle,” rather than local eruptions, the team writes. That volcanism likely came from the Wrangellia Large Igneous Province eruption in what is now British Columbia and Alaska, which has previously, but tenuously, been linked to the Carnian Pluvial Episode. If true, it means the Wrangellia eruption occurred in pulses, rather than one sustained eruption. &nbsp;</p>



<p>This paper marks the “first time that mercury and carbon isotope data are so well correlated across the Carnian Pluvial Episode,” says Andrea Marzoli, an igneous petrologist at the University of Padua in Italy who has studied Wrangellia but was not involved in this research.&nbsp; “The authors make a strong argument in favor of volcanically induced global climate change pulses.” However, Marzoli notes, “the link to Wrangellia is still weak, simply because we don’t know the age of Wrangellia.”</p>







<p>Alastair Ruffell, a forensic geologist at Queen’s University Belfast in Ireland not involved in this study, agrees, saying he’d like to see more evidence of cause and effect between Wrangellia and the environmental changes. This study offers some of the best proxies and data from terrestrial sources to date, but more terrestrial records of the Carnian Pluvial Episode are needed, he says, to “understand what this actually looked like on the ground.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>The climate changes marked a tipping point for life that couldn’t adjust, and those groups went extinct. Animals like dinosaurs and plants like cycads, says Ruffell, were “waiting in the wings” to seize their opportunity. A <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/long-necked-dinosaurs-sauropod-jurassic-herbivores">similar cycle of volcanic activity and environmental change</a> starting about 184 million years ago may have paved the way for the biggest of all dinos, long-necked sauropods, to lumber into dominance (<em>SN: 11/17/20</em>).</p>

              <h4><a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2021/09/30/blind-and-sighted-people-understand-colour-similarly/">Blind And Sighted People Understand Colour Similarly</a></h4>

              
                <p><em>By </em><a href="https://twitter.com/E_Barratt">Emma L. Barratt</a></p>



<p>Colour is generally thought of as something experienced only by those with sight. It’s often assumed that those who’re born blind can learn facts about colours — that a banana is yellow, say — but won’t have the same complex understanding of colour that sighted people have.</p>



<p>But <a href="https://www.pnas.org/content/118/33/e2020192118">new research</a> in <em>PNAS</em> from Judy Kim and colleagues at Johns Hopkins University shows that this is not the case. Instead, the researchers find that blind people have a rich understanding of colour developed through language alone.</p>



<span id="more-43991"></span>



<p>The team looked at different kinds of knowledge about colour in both sighted (N=19) and congenitally blind (N=20) participants. The research was split into three distinct experiments:</p>



<p>The first aimed to probe causal-explanatory and associative memory knowledge of real objects’ colours. Participants were asked to generate common colours for 54 specific objects which were either natural (e.g. strawberry) or artificial. In this latter group, the colour of some objects served a purpose (e.g. stop sign), but for others did not (e.g. book). Participants also indicated whether two of the same objects would be likely to have the same colour.</p>



<p>In experiment two, participants were asked to make inferences about colour consistency in novel natural and artificial objects in an “imaginary island scenario”. Participants were asked to imagine having discovered an undocumented civilisation on a remote island, complete with all that culture’s unknown objects; for example, green “Enly” gems, used for power, and yellow “Kanpa”s, used to spray odorless chemicals in the home. As objects were presented, participants were asked to guess how likely the next such one they come across would be the same colour. This task assessed the extent to which participants believed that objects within the same category (i.e. natural or artificial, with or without functional colour) would also share a colour. These beliefs would indicate that participants were able to build generalisable theories about why objects had certain colours that could be applied more widely.</p>



<p>The final experiment was more open ended; participants were asked to provide explanations as to why particular objects have their colour (eg. “Why is a carrot orange?”), and were able to give any reasons they thought to be correct. This provided further insight into the specifics of both groups’ knowledge about causal mechanisms of colour.</p>



<p>Some findings were consistent with the idea that colour knowledge is acquired through sight. For example, blind people were less likely to agree on associative colour facts; when asked to generate a common colour for a banana, only 50% of blind participants said that bananas were “yellow”, compared to practically all sighted participants. This would suggest that, at least in some cases, directly seeing the colour of an object is more informative than acquiring facts about its colour through other means.</p>



<p>However, both groups agreed more on the likely colour of both natural and artificial objects with functional colours than artificial objects whose colour served no purpose. Both blind and sighted participants also expected two natural objects (e.g. two strawberries), or two artificial objects with functional colours (e.g. two stop signs) to share the same colour, but believed it less likely that two artificial objects whose colour served no purpose (e.g. two books) would have the same colour. Similar findings were observed in the imaginary island scenario, even though neither group had ever seen the novel objects (e.g. “Enly” gems and novel cleaning devices) described in this vignette.</p>



<p>When it came to providing explanations of why object colours differed, the groups were also relatively similar. For natural objects, around a third of sighted and blind participants said that “it just is that way”, and a similar number appealed to processes to explain colouration; for example, describing how photosynthesis makes plants green. When it came to artificial objects without functional colour, both groups commonly explained that colour depended on aesthetic choices (64% vs 44%), or referred to the material from which the object was made (18% vs 13%). And finally, for functionally coloured objects, about half of both groups explained that the colour was the result of cultural convention, and a quarter of both groups said that a specific colour was used to make the object more visibile.</p>



<p>This study wonderfully illustrates that blind and sighted people share common knowledge about colour. Though the two groups differ in some domains — particularly when it comes to associative knowledge about the colour of objects (eg. bananas are yellow) — they are largely similar in their understanding of the natural occurrence and application of colours. Blind individuals are able to draw upon deep understandings of how colours function, and make inferences about totally new objects based on their category alone, in a way that closely resembles those with sight.</p>



<p>The authors take this data to suggest that those living in the same wider societal culture, sighted or blind, develop similar intuitive theories of colour which can be applied to totally novel situations.

<hr />
<p>Crises can either be transformative or disruptive. The COVID-19 pandemic has unfortunately exposed more of the latter as countries revert to nationalistic tendencies that intensify health inequities. Monitoring from <a href="https://data.undp.org/vaccine-equity/">UNDP data</a> has shown that 1 in 2 people in high-income countries (HICs) have received a shot of the COVID-19 vaccine, while only 1 in 30 have received the same in low-income countries.</p>
<p>Whether between or within countries, health inequity is a major issue requiring global cooperation and strong health systems. The launch of the <a href="https://sdgs.un.org/goals">Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)</a> in 2015 provided an opportunity to demonstrate that global cooperation is possible.</p>
<p>Our research and policy work centers on SDG 3, the goal that seeks to <a href="https://sdgs.un.org/goals/goal3">ensure healthy lives and wellbeing for all</a>. Our research values the idea that a robust ecosystem of <a href="https://ahpsr.who.int/what-we-do/what-is-health-policy-and-systems-research-(hpsr)">Health Policy and Systems Research (HPSR)</a> will contribute to getting countries back on track towards SDG 3 despite the challenges of COVID-19.</p>
<p>In this blog, we showcase an example of our SDG-related work and discuss our reflections from our participation in a convening series from May to June 2021. Around 50 representatives of HPSR institutions across Asia gathered virtually to co-create a vision and action plan for a robust HPSR ecosystem for the region. Asia is a region that has witnessed the emergence of an HPSR landscape that is diverse yet with shared challenges and opportunities. <a href="https://r4d.org/projects/health-systems-strengthening-accelerator/">Results for Development</a> and the <a href="https://ahpsr.who.int/about-us">WHO Alliance for HPSR</a> led the co-creation process with support from <a href="https://www.acceleratehss.org/">USAID and the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation</a>.</p>
<h2><strong>From Push towards Co-creation</strong></h2>
<p>The challenge in using evidence for decision-making was a frequent HPSR issue that emerged in our discussions. The traditional model of evidence translation suggests two worlds: researchers who generate evidence and policymakers who use that evidence. Current approaches based on push models view evidence generation and policymaking as separate processes, where the evidence is pushed for use in policy, as suggested by the phrase evidence-informed policymaking. There is, however, emerging consensus that push or one-way models may even aggravate tensions between researchers and policymakers. Researchers become siloed in research without contributing to policy, while policymakers become siloed in developing policies without drawing on evidence. A co-creation model of doing HPSR, similar to the experience shared by Dr. Gloria Nenita Velasco of the <a href="https://hpdpb.doh.gov.ph/health-research-division/">Philippine Department of Health</a>, can break these siloes down. In this example, the government determines and funds the research agenda while also closely collaborating with HPSR institutions across all stages of the research cycle to address the agenda.</p>

<p>Moving away from push models towards co-creation can ensure broader and meaningful participation of stakeholders. <a href="https://www.usaid.gov/work-usaid/how-to-work-with-usaid/co-creation-usaid">Co-creation</a> is the process of bringing people together to define a problem collectively, identify solutions, and build consensus around action. Drawing on the idea of co-creation, we developed through <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/acceleratorasiaseries/home?authuser=0">a series of virtual sessions</a> the following overarching HPSR vision for Asia: “A stronger enabling HPSR ecosystem of the future that is highly responsive to countries’ needs.”</p>
<figure id="attachment_12548" aria-labelledby="figcaption_attachment_12548" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 518px"><img class="wp-image-12548" src="https://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2021/09/blog-2.png" alt="" width="508" height="285" srcset="https://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2021/09/blog-2.png 1012w, https://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2021/09/blog-2-300x169.png 300w, https://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2021/09/blog-2-768x432.png 768w, https://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2021/09/blog-2-640x360.png 640w" sizes="(max-width: 508px) 100vw, 508px" /><figcaption id="figcaption_attachment_12548" class="wp-caption-text"><div class="attachment-image--caption">The co-created Health Policy and Systems Research vision for Asia had five key components.</div><div class="attachment-image--source"></div></figcaption></figure>
<p>This co-created vision had five key components from which the participants also identified several pathways for success. A common feature of the various pathways was the idea of ensuring co-creation as well within the activities of the HPSR ecosystem. These pathways included secondments or exchanges between HPSR institutions and government agencies to collaborate on policy questions, as well as implementation research, capacity development, and research agenda-setting that bring together government and other stakeholders through networks or other co-creative mechanisms.</p>
<p>A robust HPSR ecosystem contributes to making health systems equitable, resilient in times of crisis, and more responsive to ensure people’s health and wellbeing. Co-creation can help secure buy-in, especially from stakeholders in LMICs who will be instrumental in realizing this vision of a robust HPSR ecosystem. For <a href="https://iigh.unu.edu/">UNU-IIGH,</a> this means building on existing <a href="https://iigh.unu.edu/research/accelerating-the-development-of-health-policy-and-systems-research-hpsr-capacity-in-western-pacific-region-wpr-for-health-system-strengthening.html#outline">collaboration with the Malaysian Ministry of Health</a> and other partners in Asia to sustain HPSR capacity development in the region. Likewise, the vision compels HPSR institutions in the region to co-create the conditions that can set the stage for the effective use of evidence for policies in global health. As we aim for this vision, co-creation will require us to confront the power structures that maintain inequities in health policies and systems and ensure meaningful participation from LMICs and those with marginalized voices.</p>
<h2><strong>Co-creation needs Co-action</strong></h2>
<p>The enabling HPSR vision we have co-created for Asia, the global strategy to beat COVID-19, and the SDGs are all only lofty visions without implementation in practice. Co-action, the process of stakeholders united in moving together to translate their co-created ideas into action, is equally important to sustain the momentum. It remains to be seen if our co-created vision for a robust HPSR ecosystem that supports the achievement of SDG 3 could be attained in 5-10 years. The realization of the vision will require co-action among the stakeholders to fulfill their respective commitments. Co-action among the different players in the HPSR ecosystem can enable health systems to deliver quality health services equitably as routine healthcare services and through emergency response, such as during the COVID-19 pandemic. There are no silver bullets to achieve SDG 3, but co-creation with co-action is one potential pathway if we want to turn the disruption from this crisis into a transformative opportunity which, instead of reversing our gains, moves us even closer to achieve healthy lives and wellbeing for all.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/traumatic-brain-injury-tbi-protein-blood-test-predict-recovery">A blood test may help predict recovery from traumatic brain injury</a></h4>

              
                <p>Elevated blood levels of a specific protein may help scientists predict who has a better chance of bouncing back from a traumatic brain injury.</p>



<p>The protein, called neurofilament light or NfL for short, lends structural support to axons, the tendrils that send messages between brain cells. <a href="http://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/scitranslmed.abg9922">Levels of NfL peak on average at 10 times the typical level 20 days after injury</a> and stay above normal a year later, researchers report September 29 in <em>Science Translational Medicine</em>. The higher the peak NfL blood concentrations after injury, the tougher the recovery for people with TBI six and 12 months later, shows the study of 197 people treated at eight trauma centers across Europe for moderate to severe TBI.</p>



<p>Brain scans of 146 participants revealed that their peak NfL concentrations predicted the extent of brain shrinkage after six months, and axon damage at six and 12 months after injury, neurologist Neil Graham of Imperial College London and his colleagues found.</p>



<p>These researchers also had a unique opportunity to check that the blood biomarker, which gives indirect clues about the brain injury, actually measured what was happening in the brain. In 18 of the participants that needed brain surgery, researchers sampled the fluid surrounding injured neurons. NfL concentrations there correlated with NfL concentrations in the blood.</p>





<p>“The work shows that a new ultrasensitive blood test can be used to accurately diagnose traumatic brain injury,” says Graham. “This blood test can predict quite precisely who’s going to make a good recovery and who’s going to have more difficulties.”</p>



<p>Study participants were adults and mostly male, so more work needs to be done to determine if these findings apply to women, children and people with mild TBI.</p>



<p>Finding a reliable biomarker for the severity and outlook of TBI, a head injury that disrupts brain function, could improve millions of lives. Studies of <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/cte-brain-damage-football-players-top-science-stories-2017-yir">U.S. football players have brought attention</a> to the injury (<em>SN: 12/13/17</em>), but it’s a far more widespread problem. Around 55 million people globally were <a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/laneur/article/PIIS1474-4422(18)30415-0/fulltext">living with a TBI</a> in 2016, and there&#8217;s no one-size-fits-all treatment.</p>



<p>“No two traumatic brain injuries are alike,” says David Okonkwo, director of the Neurotrauma Clinical Trials Center at the University of Pittsburgh. Scientists have been looking for biomarkers of TBI injury such as NfL to develop injury-specific interventions, and Okonkwo says these new findings are promising for patients whose injury has damaged their axons.</p>



<p>“We have not had the tools to measure a specific injury type of an individual patient,” Okonkwo says. While this test probably is still a few years from use in U.S. clinics, other large research groups are looking for ways to use NfL and other blood-based biomarkers for diagnosing TBI and creating opportunities for intervention.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2021/09/29/threat-to-identity-stops-harmful-drinkers-recognising-their-alcohol-issues/">Threat To Identity Stops Harmful Drinkers Recognising Their Alcohol Issues</a></h4>

              
                <p><em>By&nbsp;</em><a href="https://twitter.com/E_Barratt">Emma L. Barratt</a></p>



<p>Here in the UK, one in five hospital admissions is the result of heavy drinking. Those who drink to the extent of needing medical assistance, as well as those who are caused problems by their own alcohol consumption, are known as <em>harmful drinkers</em>. This group is characterised not only by their high levels of alcohol consumption, but a surprisingly low level of problem recognition. Generally speaking, harmful drinkers are known for being resistant to seeing that they have an issue with drinking, often to avoid being labelled as an alcoholic, which comes with a huge amount of stigma. This phenomenon is part of what gave rise to the well-known phrase <em>&#8220;I can stop anytime I want&#8221;.</em></p>



<p>However, this creates a significant barrier to treatment. &#8220;<em>If there’s no problem, what’s there to fix?</em>&#8220;</p>



<p>Researcher James Morris, alongside colleagues from London Southbank University and Northumbria University, believe that this kind of label avoidance is a prime target that psychologists can exploit to increase uptake of treatment in harmful drinkers. Their <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0306460321002781?via%3Dihub">new study</a> in <em>Addictive Behaviors</em> suggests that the solution may be as simple as reframing the issue.</p>



<span id="more-43984"></span>



<p>People often think of drinking issues as binary — you either have one, and by extension are an alcoholic, or you don’t have any issues with alcohol consumption. This kind of binary disease model belief, however, is a simplistic approach. What’s more, the threat to identity posed by such a hard line in the sand leads to a lot of psychological resistance in heavy drinkers, who don’t wish to be saddled with the stigma of being labelled an alcoholic.</p>



<p>However, this isn’t the only way to think about diagnoses. As psychologists, we are familiar with the idea of many diagnoses lying somewhere on a continuum; similarly, alcohol use problems can be seen as lying on a spectrum of severity, as opposed to being divided by a stark cut-off line. Since continuum diagnoses less resemble being labelled, it’s possible that helping individuals hold such a view could lessen their label avoidance, and therefore resistance to problem recognition.</p>



<p>To test this, Morris and colleagues recruited&nbsp;244 harmful drinkers who did not believe they had experience with addiction. Levels of problem recognition in participants were assessed via items from the Stage of Change Readiness and Treatment Eagerness Scale (SOCRATES), which is a questionnaire used to assess problem recognition, ambivalence, and progress towards recovery in those with alcohol consumption issues.</p>



<p>Participants were shown one of six framing messages pertaining to problem drinking. Two of these were based on the continuum model, and illustrated views that all levels of drinking cause some problems, and that there’s no stark cut-off point for having an issue with alcohol consumption. Another two illustrated the binary disease model, emphasising clear differences between those who experience problems with alcohol consumption and those who do not. Two further conditions were controls, which contained prose about governmental approach to alcohol consumption. In each of these categories, one condition contained stigmatising language regarding harmful drinkers, and the other did not.</p>



<p>Overall, the way in which alcohol problems were framed didn’t make a difference: participants who had seen messages based on the continuum or binary disease model showed similar levels of problem recognition. But when this message was considered alongside the presence or absence of stigmatising language, there was an effect. Those who had seen the message that framed alcohol problems in terms of a binary disease model <em>and</em> that included stigmatising language showed significantly lower levels of problem recognition than those who had seen the same framing, but with no stigmatising language. They also showed lower levels of problem recognition than those who had read that alcohol problems were on a continuum. There was no significant difference in problem recognition between those had seen stigmatising or non-stigmatising language within the continuum framing messages group.</p>



<p>The authors interpret the results as showing that alcoholic labelling avoidance was triggered in participants in the binary disease model plus stigmatising language group. They were motivated to deflect this threat to their identity, becoming extra resistant to acknowledging that their harmful drinking may be causing problems, in order to avoid the associated stigma.</p>



<p>This was not a pattern observed for those who read about harmful drinking as a continuum, which suggests that this may be a more effective approach for encouraging those who drink excessively to recognise the impacts it may have on their lives, and subsequently access treatment. By avoiding that hard line in the sand of labelling someone an alcoholic, people are likely to feel less threat to their identity by acknowledging issues they may be having with alcohol consumption, and thus more willing to make changes.</p>



<p>As such, the authors believe that public health messaging embracing a continuum approach which minimises stigmatising language would be most effective in targeting harmful drinkers, and represents a low cost method of improving outcomes in this group.</p>

<p>“Science asks the questions. / And poetry marks the spot.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>This line from “Unweaving Science,” the opening track of the spoken word album <em>Experimental Words</em>, illuminates the connections between science and art. The album, an eclectic collection of 10 poems birthed from collaborations between researchers and spoken word artists, is a celebration of the craft and creativity that drives scientists and poets alike.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The album comes from the minds of coproducers Sam Illingworth and Dan Simpson, themselves embodiments of the bow shock between the two disciplines. Illingworth, who has a Ph.D. in atmospheric physics, is an interdisciplinary researcher at Edinburgh Napier University examining poetry as a science communication tool. Simpson, former poet in residence at Imperial College London, is known for writing poems that are influenced by science.</p>





<p>Illingworth calls <em>Experimental Words</em> a “dance. It’s an experiment.” Every part of the album, from the collaborations to the “<a href="https://experimentalwords.com/videos">music videos</a>” that accompany some of the tracks, evinces the experimentation and exploration that defines both the scientific and creative processes. Even the album cover is experimental, created from an <a href="https://codepen.io/benbennybenben/full/c47bb91deb823f206703ade53bce7e08">interactive algorithm</a> that visualizes the words of the poems. Online, listeners can play around with the algorithm, developed by graphic and web designer Ben Gregory, to create their own versions of the cover.</p>





<p>The album, available on streaming services such as <a href="https://experimentalwords.bandcamp.com/releases">Bandcamp</a>, <a href="https://open.spotify.com/album/4sLT8AMakxGnBnNndErfSG?si=VCcARGXaQquFsCeMBPBAtw&amp;dl_branch=1">Spotify</a>, <a href="https://music.apple.com/us/album/experimental-words/1573981289">Apple Music</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=StoqOvvV0hQ&amp;list=OLAK5uy_k_EQLef6jRpJv5ndkR8PfHR9H1VncK84s">YouTube</a>, aims to shatter the preconception that science and poetry mix like oil and water, Simpson says. “Poets and scientists go out into the world to try to understand it, internalize it and then try and give it back,” he says. “We’re communicators and interpreters and revealers of truth on some level.”</p>



<p>Whether scientist, poet, both or neither, listeners will likely discover some truth in <em>Experimental Words</em> that resonates. The poems have wide-ranging themes, exploring humans’ sometimes-harmonious, sometimes-contentious history with the ocean; the wonders of the universe’s plethora of sounds; the perceptions and realities of artificial intelligence; and the unsung heroism of civil engineers.</p>



<p>Each piece, anchored by its own distinct spoken word style, is colored with unique sounds and music that run the gamut from satellite audio recordings of space to a rendition of a famed 1975 performance by American jazz musician Keith Jarrett.</p>



<p>“Glass Bridge,” for instance, written and recorded by civil and environmental engineer Sunday Popo-Ola of Imperial College London and spoken word artist Malaika Kegode, features an original instrumental piece written by Kegode and her sister, Handina Dutiro. A meditation on the everyday innovations many people take for granted — clean water, well-lit roads, trains, shoes — the poem opens with a challenge: “It is true that we shouldn’t walk on glass. But what if that glass is a bridge, and it is your only way to cross the valley?” A playful percussive motif that evokes a person tinkering with metal tools invites the listener to “meet on that glass bridge / in all its translucent strength / and talk about the invisible, / visible things that keep us alive.”</p>



<p>In “Mechanisms &amp; Multitudes,” a piece about artificial intelligence, computer scientist Ruth Aylett of Heriot-Watt University in Edinburgh and poet Momtaza Mehri play with synthetic and human voices for the poem’s three characters. Daedalus, the mythical Greek architect and craftsman, and PARRY, an early chatbot relic from 1972, don mechanical voices that contrast with the human inflections of <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/idea-makers-tackles-scientific-thinkers-big-ideas-and-personal-lives">Ada Lovelace</a>, widely considered the first computer programmer and who was known for her philosophy of “poetical science” (<em>SN: 8/13/16</em>).</p>



<p><em>Experimental Words</em> features poets and scientists from various personal, artistic and scientific backgrounds. All of the collaborators live in the United Kingdom — which is not surprising since the project originated as a set of live performances there. These roots in the local U.K. sphere left me curious about how the project might evolve in the future, perhaps incorporating more international collaborations or even different media.</p>



<p>Still, the album’s themes are universal. And listeners are dared to “realize that science and poetry are not mutually exclusive entities, but complementary ways of understanding the world in which we live,” Illingworth says.</p>



<p>The album asserts this message on the final track. In “Shapeshifter,” entomologist and science communicator Adam Hart of the University of Gloucestershire in England and poet Desree personify science and art as entities that “carry life, uphill, on their backs / and yet still have to beg for a sustainable rucksack.” The piece, which begins with an argument between the two disciplines about their values to humankind, concludes with the resolution that they are, indeed, one and the same: “I am a shapeshifter / Tell me what you need, / And that, that I’ll be.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/identical-twin-siblings-common-set-chemical-markers-dna-epigenetics">All identical twins may share a common set of chemical markers on their DNA</a></h4>

              
                <p>Identical siblings are used to sharing a lot with their twin, including their DNA. But new research suggests all identical twins share a common signature of twinhood, not in their DNA, but on it.</p>



<p>This signature is part of the epigenome, chemical markers that dot many spots along DNA and influence the activity of genes without altering their sequence. Identical twins everywhere largely <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-021-25583-7">share a specific set of these marks that persists from birth to adulthood</a>, researchers report September 28 in <em>Nature Communications</em>. These shared epigenetic tags could be used to identify people who were conceived as identical twins but lost their sibling in the womb or were separated at birth.</p>



<p>“This paper is absolutely fascinating,” says Nancy Segal, a developmental psychologist at California State University, Fullerton who has researched twins but wasn’t involved in the study. The research sets the groundwork for scientists to better understand “what might cause a fertilized egg to split and form monozygotic [identical] twins,” she says.</p>



<p>Despite humans’ age-old fascination with identical twins, the biological process that generates them, known as monozygotic twinning, “is an enigma,” says Jenny van Dongen, an epigeneticist at Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam.</p>





<p>Researchers know that identical twins form after a fertilized egg, called a zygote, somehow splits into two embryos during development. But why this cleavage happens remains unknown, van Dongen says. For the most part, identical twins don’t run in families, and they occur at roughly the same rate worldwide — about 3 to 4 per 1,000 births. With no clear genetic or environmental cause, the prevailing hypothesis is that identical twins arise at random, she says.</p>



<p>Early development, for twins and non-twins alike, happens amid a flurry of epigenetic changes that turn many genes on or off as an embryo takes shape. Some of these <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/study-shows-where-identical-twins-part-ways">changes may account for slight differences</a> between identical twins (<em>SN: 7/17/</em><em>12</em>). So to better understand what makes a zygote split to form identical twins, “it makes sense to look at epigenetics,” van Dongen says.</p>



<p>She and colleagues looked for epigenetic differences at over 450,000 sites along the genomes of nearly 6,000 monozygotic twins and dizygotic, or fraternal, twins. Comparing identical twins with fraternal twins, as opposed to comparing twins to non-twins, allowed the researchers to rule out any epigenetic changes that stemmed from the unusual experience of sharing a womb.</p>



<p>At 834 spots along the genome, identical twins were strikingly similar, the researchers found. These shared epigenetic marks were concentrated in certain parts of the genome, including centromere and telomere regions on chromosomes. Some marks were near genes involved in early developmental processes, including those that regulate how tightly cells stick to one another. Whether these differences have health consequences for identical twins is unclear, van Dongen says.</p>



<p>These epigenetic signs popped up in twins young and old, from places as far-flung as Finland to Australia and were found in different cell types. The shared marks are so uniquely common to identical twins that the researchers were able to devise a test that can determine, with up to 80 percent accuracy, whether an individual is an identical twin. That includes individuals who don’t know that they lost their twin during pregnancy, a phenomenon known as vanishing twin syndrome, and twins who were separated at birth.</p>



<p>“This is a very, very important finding that opens up a lot of avenues of inquiry,” says Segal, the developmental psychologist. For example, identical twins are predisposed for a variety of conditions, from left-handedness to certain congenital disorders such as spina bifida, where the spine fails to develop properly. Perhaps, for some portion of people, these conditions stem from being an unknown identical twin, she says.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Whether this epigenetic signature is a cause, consequence or by-product of monozygotic twinning remains unclear, van Dongen says. It’s possible that some of these epigenetic changes tell a zygote to split. Alternatively, these chemical marks could reflect the epigenetic aftermath of the splitting event.</p>



<p>“They could be like a persistent molecular scar of the [splitting] process itself,” says Robert Waterland, an epigeneticist at Baylor College of Medicine in Houston. “An embryo splitting in two pieces would kind of upset things,” he says, and that could disrupt normal epigenetic processes in a way that leaves a permanent mark. He gravitates towards that molecular scar interpretation, though more studies are needed to know for sure, he says.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/~r/plos/Blog/~3/PipwNVEWrvo/">How can publishers better meet the open research needs of funders and institutions?</a></h4>

              
                <!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/loose.dtd">
<html><body><p><strong>Author:</strong> Iain Hrynaszkiewicz, Director, Open Research Solutions</p>



<p><em>Publishers investing in simple solutions in their workflows can help to better meet the needs of funders and institutions who wish to support open research practices, research </em><a href="https://osf.io/z4py9"><em>released this week by PLOS</em></a><em> concludes.</em></p>



<p>Policies can be an effective solution for changing research culture and practice. A growing number of research-performing organisations (institutions) and funding agencies <a href="https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0237464">have policies that support open research practices</a> &mdash; sharing of research data, code and software &mdash; as <a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2020/02/2020-a-turning-point-for-research-data-policy/">do publishers</a>. Seeking to deepen our understanding of funder and institution needs related to open research, we surveyed more than 100 funders and institutions in 2020. We wanted to know if they are evaluating how researchers share data and code, how they are doing it, why they are doing it, and how satisfied they are with their ability to get these tasks done. Our <a href="https://osf.io/z4py9">results are available as a preprint</a> along with <a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.14994498">an anonymised dataset</a>.</p>



<p>Half of respondents had tried to evaluate if researchers are sharing data or code in the past and most plan to do this in the future. The most common reason for assessing data or code sharing was a desire to understand or compare the current state of practices of researchers and the third most common was to inform the development of policies, support or services with the information.<br>However, the approaches being used to assess open research practice appear to be unsatisfactory. Personal contact with researchers, such as via email, was the most common method. One respondent described the task as <em>&ldquo;A very manual process of looking at the individual articles we have funded to see how the data is shared</em>.&rdquo; For organisations that don&rsquo;t &mdash; yet &mdash; have policies on open research, beyond open access to articles, their needs are even less well met. To plan for change, as one respondent from an institution noted, they need better information on how their faculty are currently practicing open research.</p>



<p><img loading="lazy" width="606" height="457" src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/kjx5GyRCanR6AWg0VHrcoDSg1IwRHF9p4nnrsQCH1MUQhYbfHeA-1KXdNZtDTFpft2BC4mAcsEBlCiXa7PHZKtSDKmTmGO4QoDlt_bpebgHWm69zmMNi_QOtV8HFQHYIteIS8fSN=s0"></p>



<p>Overall, the results imply that the growth of policies and requirements for making research data and code available does not appear to be matched with capabilities or solutions for determining if these policies have been complied with. Measuring policy compliance was the second most common reason for evaluating open research practices. Further, there appear to be insufficient tools, or awareness of tools, to support organisations in guiding strategic and policy decisions that could benefit open research.</p>



<p>The issues that seem to be the most challenging for funders and institutions are also the most complex. Determining if research data have been made available <em>in a reusable form</em>, and determining <em>why research data or code have not been shared</em> were among the least satisfied tasks. <a href="https://doi.org/10.31219/osf.io/njr5u">Our previous research</a> suggested researchers also need better solutions for finding research data they can reuse, and obtaining data that are not publicly available.</p>



<p>Another key finding is the limitation of the research paper as the primary mode of research assessment. The evaluation of open research practices associated with specific <em>grants</em>, rather than papers, was even more important to respondents.</p>



<p>However, while evaluating research papers for data and code sharing practices will not tell the whole story of open research, the results do imply that simple solutions implemented by journals and publishers can make some progress towards better meeting some of the needs we assessed in our survey. Many respondents were not satisfied with their ability to complete important tasks that relate to finding information in publications.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Simple solutions more publishers could provide include:</p>



<ul><li><strong>Mandatory Data Availability Statements (DAS) in all relevant publications</strong>.<br>Across the STM industry <a href="https://dashboard.stm-assoc.org/">around 15% of papers</a> include a DAS. Since we introduced our data availability policy in 2014, 100% of PLOS research articles include a DAS.</li><li><strong>Supporting researchers to provide information on why research data (and code) are <em>not</em> publicly available with their publications</strong>.<br><a href="https://bmjopen.bmj.com/content/6/10/e011784">Time</a> <a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2775667">and</a> <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-021-00981-0">again</a> &ldquo;data available on request&rdquo; has been shown to be ineffective at supporting new research &mdash; and is not permitted in PLOS journals.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Enabling and encouraging the use of data repositories.</strong><br>Recommending the use of data repositories is a useful step, but making them easily and freely accessible &mdash; integrated into the publishing process &mdash; can be even more effective. Rates of repository use are higher in journals that partner closely with repositories and remove cost barriers to their use.</li><li><strong>Providing visible links to research data on publications</strong>.Many researchers also struggle to find data they can reuse, hence PLOS will <a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2021/09/wellcome-trust-awards-plos-a-grant-to-test-ways-to-increase-sharing-and-discovery-of-research-data">soon be experimenting</a> with improving this functionality in our articles, and integrating the Dryad repository with submission.</li></ul>



<p>For many researchers, to whom we know compliance with funder policies is important, publishing work in a way, or in journals, that support transparency in the availability of research data and code will be helpful in meeting their funders&rsquo; and institutions&rsquo; needs &mdash; as well as supporting reuse and impact of their research.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/transparent-ink-printer-butterflies-color-spectrum-microscale-pattern">These colorful butterflies were created using transparent ink</a></h4>

              
                <p>You’ve heard of disappearing ink. Now get ready for suddenly appearing ink. Using a clear liquid, researchers can print a full rainbow of colors on transparent surfaces. The trick is printing the liquid in precise, microscale patterns that create structural color.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/sunbirds-feathers-iridescence-heat-light">Structural colors</a> arise from the way different wavelengths of light bounce off <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/butterfly-inspired-nanostructures-can-sort-light">microscopic imperfections</a> on surfaces (<em>SN: 8/17/21; SN: 6/1/16</em>). “In nature, there are many beautiful structure colors, such as the wings of butterflies, the feathers of peacocks, the skin of chameleons and so on,” says Yanlin Song, a materials chemist at the Chinese Academy of Sciences in Beijing.</p>



<p>Song and colleagues printed structural colors on transparent silicone sheets using an ordinary ink-jet printer and clear polymer ink. The printer studded the silicone sheets with millions of microscopic ink domes, each of which served as a single pixel in the resulting image. Adjusting the size of a microdome <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/oil-water-droplets-glow-vibrant-colors">changed the wavelengths of light that the dome reflected</a> and therefore its color (<em>SN: 3/8/19</em>). Increasing the width of a single dome from 6.6 to 11 micrometers <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.abh1992">shifted its hue</a> along the spectrum from blue to red and back again, the researchers report online September 22 in <em>Science Advances</em>.</p>



<p>The denser the domes were packed, the brighter the image. And printing a medley of differently colored ink pixels across a single area created blended shades, such as brown and gray. Using the technique, Song’s team printed multicolor, photorealistic portraits of Isaac Newton, Marilyn Monroe and other famous figures.</p>

<p>“I was excited to see that somebody had used [structural color] for this purpose,” says Lauren Zarzar, a materials chemist at Penn State who has studied similar structural colors cast by water and oil droplets. “They had some nice examples that I think illustrated the versatility of this mechanism.”</p>



<p>Zarzar imagines using structural colors to create complex optical signatures for anti-counterfeiting features on ID cards or currency. Such shimmery, colorfast hues could also make useful materials for cosmetics, clothing or architecture, she says.</p>

                <p><em>By</em> <a href="https://emmayoung.net/">Emma Young</a></p>



<p>The world is full of migrants — not only refugees from places like Afghanistan and Syria, but also people who have travelled to study, or to work in another country. In fact, 281 million people live outside their country of birth or citizenship. They face all kinds of challenges, and adapting well to life in a new culture is a critical one.</p>



<p>Current thinking holds that what an immigrant <em>does</em> is important for how well they adapt both psychologically and socially. A combination of maintaining one’s own culture while also engaging in the mainstream culture is widely held to be the best strategy. This idea, known as integration or biculturalism, has informed advice and also policy-making. But a <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/09567976211006432">major study</a> in <em>Psychological Science</em> now argues that it is wrong. In fact, report Kinga Bierwiaczonek and Jonas Kunst at the University of Oslo, there is only “miniscule” evidence that any culture-oriented strategy adopted by an immigrant affects how well they adapt. As the pair writes, with some understatement: “In a world in which virtually every modern society is culturally diverse, our findings have considerable implications.”</p>



<span id="more-43943"></span>



<p>Psychologists have identified four &#8220;acculturation styles&#8221;: integration, assimilation (which entails giving up the heritage culture), separation (maintaining the heritage culture and not adopting aspects of the new culture) and marginalisation (neither maintaining the heritage culture nor adopting the mainstream culture).</p>



<p>The idea that integration is best dates back to the early 1990s. In 1997, John Berry, then at the universities of Bergen and Oxford, wrote a <a href="https://iaap-journals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1464-0597.1997.tb01087.x">highly influential paper</a> in which he concluded that psychological and sociocultural adaptation “are usually predicted by the successful pursuit of the integration acculturation strategy.”</p>



<p>However, the vast majority of studies supporting this idea are correlational, write Bierwiaczonek and Kunst. This leaves open the possibility that there could be other explanations — perhaps, for example, it’s more cognitively challenging to maintain aspects of one’s own culture while also adopting aspects of the new one, and more cognitively able immigrants also adapt better.</p>



<p>The pair also has concerns about the way some of the data has been analysed. An <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0022022111435097">influential meta-analysis of mostly these correlational studies</a>, which supported the integration hypothesis, used a statistical approach that Bierwiaczonek and Kunst feel could allow for misinterpretations.</p>



<p>When they re-analysed these 83 studies, on a total of more than 23,000 participants, they reached a different conclusion: “acculturation has a very limited association with adaptation”.</p>



<p>The pair then conducted a meta-analysis of 19 exclusively longitudinal studies on just under 7,000 people. (This included children and adolescents as well as adults who had moved to countries such as the UK, US, Germany, Hong Kong and Finland.) Because these studies included measures of acculturation and also adaptation (such as symptoms of depression, mood, school performance and social relationships) over time, they should in theory provide a clearer picture of any links between a strategy and adaptation. Bierwiaczonek and Kunst’s analysis did reveal some effects of acculturation strategy on adaptation — but they were “inconsistent and approached zero.” In other words, no helpful conclusions could be drawn from them.</p>



<p>Bierwiaczonek and Kunst argue that it might be better for policy-makers and support organisations to look to other factors known to influence an immigrant’s wellbeing, such as discrimination in the community, language barriers and social support. As they point out, “This generally puts more of the burden of successful adaptation on the receiving societies than on migrants themselves.”</p>



<p>The findings have implications for future research in this area, too. They suggest that further correlational studies would be of little help. “The field of acculturation should move on to primarily relying on investigations that utilize experiments as well as rigorous longitudinal methods,” Bierwiaczonek and Kunst argue. Given that the wellbeing of millions of people — including many vulnerable children and adults — is at stake, surely this can’t come too soon.</p>
