<p>There has been little research into what it’s like for police detectives to investigate the death of a child. As bluntly stated in official police guidance documents “children are not meant to die”, and coping with these circumstances, especially as a detective and parent, could involve emotional and psychological demands beyond those experienced when investigating adult murders.</p>
<p>For a new explorative <a href="http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11896-016-9218-5">study</a> in the <em>Journal of Police and Criminal Psychology, </em>Jason Roach and his colleagues surveyed 99 police detectives from 23 forces across England and Wales: most of them were white and male, and they had conducted investigations into an average of 30 adult murders and 7 unexplained child deaths. Compared to dealing with adult homicides, the detectives said they felt more pressure to solve cases involving children, found them harder to deal with emotionally, and thought more about them after the cases had ended.</p>
<p><span id="more-17559"></span></p>
<p>The detectives also considered child cases to be more complex and said they were more likely to handle them by turning to formal guidance, such as the <em>Murder Investigation Manual</em>, which was published by the Association of Chief Police Officers in 2006. This suggests they wanted to do things by the book rather than relying on intuition, which seems sensible given the relative rarity of such cases.</p>
<p>Some of the emotional effects of child cases were weaker when detectives had experienced them within the last six months. This seems counterintuitive, but the researchers speculated that while dealing with any violent crime can deliver an emotional load in the short term, the impressions of a case involving a child are harder to shake, so its severity becomes more obvious over time.</p>
<p>The research shows that seniority provided no bulwark against being shaken by these cases. In fact, more senior detectives reported higher levels of impact on their home life, and had significantly more trouble sleeping and more ruminative thoughts. They were even more likely to turn to the <em>Murder Investigation Manual</em> and other guidance to support them in these cases, suggesting that they accepted these are high-grade cases to handle. The effects of rank were also found in investigations of adult cases, but to a lesser extent.</p>
<p>The 83 per cent of the detectives who had children of their own, had a slightly different take from their childless counterparts, reporting that they were less able to control their emotions when working on the child cases, and that they were more focused on them. So the cases hit closer to home, making them both harder and more important. The younger their own children, the more emotional blowback the detectives reported experiencing.</p>
<p>This is an explorative study so the findings need to be treated carefully. But the research reveals a world that before now most of us have only encountered through the imaginations of screenwriters. Unlike their fictional counterparts, the real-life detectives didn’t report becoming hardened to child death, but if anything were more sensitive later in their careers, which suggests they may benefit from psychological support services just as much as early career officers.</p>
<p>The research also suggests that there may be value in targeting support downstream from difficult cases, to help detectives work through residual experiences that are proving hard to shift. As Roach and his team conclude, “further research must continue to explore how investigative decisions are made in such difficult and stressful circumstances if we are to give those good enough to do it as much self-protection as possible.”</p>

            <img alt="Zhu et al., 2016" class="attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image" height="150" src="http://blogs.plos.org/neuro/files/2017/01/Zhu-et-al.-2016-150x150.jpg" style="display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;" width="150" /><p>The 20<sup>th</sup> century has seen an explosion of scientific efforts made to reveal the biological substrates of cognitive functions. Research has shown that emotions and cognitive processes interact to build up complex behavioural responses and drive environmental adaptations. Fear, one of our noble and sophisticated adaptive brain functions, requires a perfect integration of emotional and cognitive inputs. Interactions of memory, learning and emotions then shape our actions. This dynamic understanding of the brain is a fairly recent development in neuroscience.</p>
<p>As <em>PLOS Biology</em> Associate Editor Gabriel Gasque writes to introduce a new PLOS Open Highlights Research Collection titled <a href="http://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.2001633">Seven Glimpses into the Emotional Brain</a>, “Cognition – the term that includes mental processes such as attention, memory, problem-solving, planning, and language – stopped being exclusively a philosophical subject approached by introspection and became a matter of empirical investigation and objective quantification.”</p>
<p>One of the articles in this Collection, published in <em>Nature Communications</em> by <a href="http://www.nature.com/articles/ncomms11096">Zhu and authors</a>, explored the mechanisms required for normal development of the amygdala, a brain region highly involved in emotions, fear and memory. In fact, the amygdala must be considered as a sensory hub for the integration of emotional stimuli. Thus, understanding neural circuits underlying emotional and cognitive states is fundamental since dysfunctions of early emotional circuits may lead to neurodevelopmental disorders such as autism and schizophrenia.</p>
<p>Among all the biomolecules able to promote or interfere with emotional and cognitive functions, we know that ephrins and their specific receptors play a major role in modulating brain plasticity and sensory integration. Ephrins are membrane-bound proteins that act as ligands of Eph receptors and have been extensively documented as fundamental for axon guidance. Ephrins have previously been shown to be key actors in cellular phenomena such as axon pruning, synaptogenesis, synaptic and structural plasticity. At the behavioural level, ephrin-B3 (eB3) has also been found to be associated with anxiety disorders and mental retardation.</p>
<p>Using specific gene-targeted mice, Zhu and authors observed that ephrin-B3 is required during a critical period in the neonatal brain for axon targeting and dendritic spine formation in the amygdala and for the development of innate fear. Xiao-Na Zhu, the leading author of this study said, “we found that eB3 deletion leads to a significant defect in innate fear behaviour, which is associated with a disruption in connections of amygdala neurons.”</p>
<p>The authors’ results are in agreement with their hypothesis that eB3 stimulates forward signaling to guide axon targeting for trans-nucleus modulation (from hippocampus to amygdala) and thereby coordinates spinogenesis and neuronal activation in the amygdala. Thus, according to these findings, eB3 may act by allowing pre- and post-synaptic structures interacting and thereby coordinates axon targeting, morphology and neuronal reactions in the amygdala.</p>
<figure class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_19095" style="width: 530px;"><a href="http://blogs.plos.org/neuro/files/2017/01/Zhu-et-al.-2016b-1.jpg"><img alt="Model of timed pre- and post-synaptic coordination for inter-nucleus neuronal connection for defensive neuronal responses.

The mushroom spinogenesis and defensive neuronal activity are disrupted in Efnb3−/− mice (from Zhu et al., 2016)</figure>
<p>Interestingly, eB3 was observed mainly in the hippocampus (a memory-related area) but not in the amygdala (a fear-related area), raising then the question of how eB3 in these structures may initiate molecular reactions to modify amygdala through wired trans-nucleus synapses. “Mechanistically”, propose the authors:“Phosphorylated EphB receptors can regulate GluN1 receptor-dependent influx of calcium, leading to synaptic function-related gene expression which eventually facilitates spine morphogenesis and hence neuronal reactions to aversive cues”.</p>
<p>We know that the brain elicits innate fear-driven responses by integrating sensory stimuli with critical brain nuclei that are involved in the initiation and modulation of amygdala-mediated emotional responses. The authors argue that because aberrant wiring of emotional circuits could lead to neurodevelopmental disorders characterized by socio-emotional impairments, these results could explain why deficiencies in Ephrin-B/EphB signaling have been linked to anxiety disorders and autism.</p>
<p>Of course, further investigations will be necessary to fully uncover the biological substrates by which our brain, especially during development, integrates sensory inputs, computes and elaborates them in order to build up complex behaviors.</p>

<p>Rice is a staple food crop in India and many other places in the world. Knowing how genetically diverse a crop is and the pattern of that diversity is important as it helps in developing suitable breeding strategies.  Indian rice varieties are known to be very genetically diverse.  However, studies have shown that there has been a loss of some of this diversity, particularly as a result of mass crop production (green revolution).  As there had not been a detailed study carried out on this trend, Singh <em>et al</em> decided to do an analysis using <span class="_Tgc">Simple Sequence Repeat (</span>SSR) markers, looking at the genetic trends of a large set of Indian rice varieties (released between 1940-2013) held in the National Gene Bank of India.</p>
<blockquote><p>Rice is a staple food crop in India and many other places in the world. Knowing how genetically diverse a crop is and the pattern of that diversity is important as it helps in developing suitable breeding strategies.</p></blockquote>
<p>Their results showed that between 1940 and 2005, genetic diversity between Indian rice varieties increased, but then began to decrease between the years 2006-2013. They concluded that the recent trait based improvement program resulted in breeders relying too heavily on certain varieties, which in turn caused the loss of gene diversity in Indian rice between 2006-2013.  This suggests that breeders need to increase the genetic diversity of this crop by introducing other varieties of Indian rice into the current breeding program.</p>

<p>Cerebellar cortical degeneration (CCD) is a brain disease for which certain breeds of dog have a genetic predisposition. Typical symptoms include a loss of co-ordination, head tilting and abnomal posturing in the dog. Age of onset and rate of progression of the disease varies between dog breeds. Histopathological findings typically include primary Purkinje neuronal degeneration and death.  The genes responsible for the disease have been identified for several dog breeds, including Old English Sheepdogs, Gordon Setters and Scottish Terriers, allowing for selective breeding to reduce the number of dogs with the condition. Fenn<em> et al</em> published the results of a study looking at the genetic cause of CCD in Hungarian Vizslas.</p>
<figure class="wp-caption alignright" id="attachment_8423" style="width: 310px;"><img alt="dog-1190024_1280" class="wp-image-8423 size-medium" height="225" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2017/01/dog-1190024_1280-300x225.jpg" width="300" /><div class="attachment-image--caption">Pixabay</div><div class="attachment-image--source"></div></figure>
<p>They reported on the case of two puppies from the same litter that had been diagnosed with CCD and euthanized shortly afterwards. Histopathological examination revealed primary Purkinje neuron loss consistent with the condition.  The article then goes on to describe how whole genome sequencing successfully identified a splice donor site mutation in the SNX14 gene, the functions of which include maintaining normal neuronal excitability and synaptic transmission, that likely to be the cause of the disease in Hungarian Vizsla dogs.</p>

<p>One of the main functions of the captive panda population is to ensure that the genetic diversity found in wild giant pandas living in their natural habitats is preserved.  Understanding the genetic contributions from each of the wild panda populations in captive pandas is essential when planning breeding programs to preserve the genetic diversity of the species.</p>
<p>Yang <em>et al</em> investigated the genetic contributions from different wild panda populations to the captive panda populations. They found that this genetic diversity was very unbalanced, with one large wild panda population (Qionglai) accounting for over 50% of the captive panda gene pool.  This is in stark comparison to the 3.6% contributed by the smaller panda population from Xiaoxiangling. The Daxiangling population was shown not to contribute to the genetic composition of the captive population at all.</p>
<blockquote><p>One of the main functions of the captive panda population is to ensure that the genetic diversity found in wild giant pandas living in their natural habitats is preserved.</p></blockquote>
<p>Breeding recommendations to increase the genetic contributions made from one of the smaller wild panda populations  may be at the expense of other similarly sized ones.  With this in mind, Yang <em>et al</em> developed three habitat-controlled breeding plans to increase the genetic contributions from the smallest wild panda populations with little to no representation currently in the captive giant panda population.  Incorporating contributions from these populations into panda breeding programs could increase their genetic representation in the captive panda population in the near future.</p>

<p>Epidermolysis bullosa is a rare inherited skin disease that causes the skin to be very fragile and blister easily. A recent article by Pausch <em>et al</em> described how artificial insemination can cause the spread of the disease in Vorderwald cattle.</p>
<figure class="wp-caption alignleft" id="attachment_8426" style="width: 310px;"><img alt="cow-7442_1920" class="wp-image-8426 size-medium" height="225" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2017/01/cow-7442_1920-300x225.jpg" width="300" /><div class="attachment-image--caption">Pixabay</div><div class="attachment-image--source"></div></figure>
<p>Whole genome haplotype-based tests allowed researchers to identify the locus responsible as the distal end of chromosome 22.  A nonsense mutation in the COL7A1 gene was shown to cause this autosomal recessive disease; the same mutation had previously been found to cause epidermolysis bullosa in Rotes Höhenvieh cattle.</p>
<p>The identification of the mutation now means that carrier animals can be detected and prevented from mating and spreading this painful skin disease.</p>

<p>Imagine the arrival of some high-tech brain device for treating mental health problems. It’s effective for many, but there’s an important side-effect. It changes your personality. Alarm ensues as campaigners warn that users risk being altered fundamentally for years to come. Now replay this scenario but replace the neuro-gizmo with good old-fashioned psychotherapy, and realise this: we’re talking fact, not fiction. <a href="http://psycnet.apa.org/psycinfo/2017-00079-001/">A new meta-analysis in <em>Psychological Bulletin</em></a> has looked at 207 psychotherapy and related studies published between 1959 and 2013, involving over 20,000 participants, with measures of personality taken repeatedly over time. The analysis has found that just a few weeks of therapy is associated with significant and long-lasting changes in clients’ personalities, especially reductions in the trait of Neuroticism and increases in Extraversion.</p>
<p><span id="more-17416"></span></p>
<p>Talk of personality change can sound unsettling because we think of our personalities as reflecting our essential “me-ness”. But from a wellbeing perspective, the trait changes uncovered by this new research are welcome and may even underlie the benefits of therapy. Neuroticism or emotional instability is an especially important risk factor for future poor mental and physical health, and meanwhile high scorers on Extraversion are known to be happier on average and more optimistic.</p>
<p>The authors of the new research, Brent Roberts at the University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign, and his colleagues, also report that personality change appeared to occur remarkably quickly. Roughly four or more weeks of therapy was enough to induce meaningful change. In fact, beyond eight weeks, more therapy was not associated with greater personality change. Therapy-related changes to trait Neuroticism were especially significant – a few weeks of therapy led to about half the amount of increase in emotional stability that you would typically expect to see someone exhibit over an entire lifetime (as a general trend, most of us slowly but surely become more emotionally stable as we get older).</p>
<p>Roberts and his team were particularly interested in whether the therapy-related personality changes they uncovered simply reflected an effect of mood or a genuine change in traits. Consistent with the idea that these were true trait changes, they found that personality change was larger in participants in treatment groups compared with those in control conditions, and that changes were found to last over the course of years without fading.</p>
<p>The researchers also uncovered a small number of “non-clinical” trials that involved healthy participants undertaking cognitive training and other interventions rather than psychotherapy, and that measured personality over time. Here too there was evidence of significant personality change, again arguing against the idea that the effects of psychotherapy on personality merely reflect a return to a non-depressed mood or to one’s natural personality pre-illness. However, Roberts and his team cautioned there were only a few of these non-clinical trials and they tended to be conducted over short time scales, so the question of whether psychotherapy is transforming a client’s personality or “remaking” it to an earlier state remains open for now.</p>
<p>Other details to emerge from the analysis: extent of observed personality change was about the same for different kinds of therapy, for instance be that CBT or psychodynamic (though hospitalisation was associated with the least amount of change); clients diagnosed with depression or personality disorders exhibited the greatest personality change compared with other conditions; and the size of the effects were the same across gender and age. This last finding concerning age is especially intriguing. As the researchers said, it appears to support “the plasticity principle that personality is an open system and amenable to change” through the lifespan.</p>
<p>There are some notable limitations to the new analysis, especially the fact that the studies under review almost entirely relied on clients’ ratings of their own personalities (though the fact that not all traits changed positively in response to therapy argues against a general effect on self-presentation or personality-related self-esteem). The research also leaves unanswered a big question for the future: just <em>how</em> is psychotherapy enacting these personality trait changes?</p>
<p>Cautions noted, this important paper shines a welcome light on a little discussed consequence of psychotherapy, and it feeds into a broader movement in clinical psychology that is recognising the important role of personality in mental health. In the near future we may see the development of therapeutic interventions that more deliberately target personality trait changes, rather than these changes being a kind of side-effect. The research also speaks to an ongoing debate in personality science about just how much personality changes, with the new findings arguing against the idea that change can only ever occur slowly.</p>
<p>“Personality traits are not only robust predictors of important life outcomes, but also appear amenable to intervention,” Roberts and his team concluded. “This fact opens the door to a new era of research that more strongly links personality and clinical psychology, and other groups, such as educational psychologists and economists, who are interested in changing people and their behaviours in order to help them with their lives.”</p>

 Accurate genome inheritance by daughter cells requires that sister chromatids in the mother attach to microtubules emanating from opposite poles of the mitotic spindle (bi-orientation). A surveillance mechanism named the spindle assembly checkpoint (SAC) monitors the microtubule attachment process, temporarily halting sister chromatid separation and mitotic exit until completion of bi-orientation1. SAC failure results in abnormal chromosome numbers (aneuploidy), a hallmark of many tumours. The HORMA domain protein MAD2 is a subunit of the SAC effector mitotic checkpoint complex (MCC). Structural conversion from open to closed MAD2 is required for MAD2 incorporation in MCC1. In vitro, MAD2 conversion and MCC assembly requires several hours2–4, while the SAC response in cells is established in a few minutes5–7. To address this discrepancy, we reconstituted with purified components a near-complete SAC signalling system and monitored MCC assembly with real-time sensors. Dramatic acceleration of MAD2 conversion and MCC assembly was observed when MPS1 phosphorylated the MAD1:MAD2 complex, triggering its template function in the MAD2 conversion and contributing to the establishment of a physical platform for MCC assembly. Thus, catalytic activation of the SAC depends on regulated protein-protein interactions that accelerate the spontaneous but rate-limiting conversion of MAD2 required for MCC assembly.

            <p>Automated testing is a paramount activity in agile development. Tests act as a guard to catch and localize software defects early. Production code relies on automated tests, however tests do not often have the luxury to be automatically checked by someone or something else. Therefore, high quality tests should be at place to ensure tests are doing a good job. There are many aspects to test quality, such as test effectiveness, test maintainability, etc. Usually, deviations from practices considered as good may lead to code smells, which in test code we call test-smells. Much empirical work has already been channelled through measuring the effectiveness of tests, however there is a lack of empirical evidence for the impact of test-smells on test quality. In this talk I will be focused on giving a brief introduction to software testing, and its importance. I will then explain the practices for writing good tests, and discuss the implications when these good practices are not met.</p>

<p>Understanding jokes requires a certain amount of mental agility, psychologists tell us, because you need to recognise a sudden shift in meaning, or appreciate the blending of odd contexts that don’t normally go together. A <a href="http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10339-016-0789-y">new study</a> in the journal <em>Cognitive Processing</em> has tested whether intelligence plays the same role in the appreciation of sick or black humour: the kind of jokes that make light of death, illness and the vulnerable. Consistent with past research linking intelligence with joke appreciation, the participants who most liked cartoons based on black humour also scored highest on verbal and non-verbal IQ.</p>
<p><span id="more-17342"></span></p>
<p>Fourteen researchers, led by <a href="http://www.psychologie-in-wien.at/ueber-uns/univprofdrmag-ulrike-willinger/">Ulrike Willinger</a> at the Medical University of Vienna, asked 156 participants, with an average age of 33 and including 76 women, to rate their comprehension and enjoyment of 12 black humour cartoons taken from <em>The Black Book</em> by Uli Stein. For instance, one cartoon depicted a confused man holding a public telephone, the voice coming from the phone saying: “Here is the answering machine of the self-help association for Alzheimer patients. If you still remember your topic, please speak after the tone.” The participants also completed basic tests of their verbal and non-verbal IQ and answered questions about their mood, aggressive tendencies and educational background.</p>
<p>The researchers identified three distinct groups of participants based on their understanding and appreciation for the sick cartoons (incidentally, age and gender appeared not to be relevant factors). One group showed the highest sick humour appreciation and comprehension, and they also scored the highest on verbal and non-verbal IQ, were better educated, and scored lower for aggression and bad mood. This fits with past research showing that sense of humour correlates with IQ, but refutes the somewhat commonly held belief that people who like black humour tend to be grumpy and perhaps a little prone to sadism.</p>
<p>A second group showed moderate comprehension and the lowest sick joke enjoyment. These people had average intelligence scores, but showed the most negative mood and the highest aggression. So perhaps opposite to what you might expect, this research found no evidence that grumpy, aggressive people enjoy sick or black humour. Meanwhile, the final group showed moderate sick humour comprehension and preference, and they had average intelligence scores, generally positive mood and moderate aggression scores.</p>
<p>Willinger and her team said their findings suggested black humour processing is a “complex information-processing task”, and were consistent with past research suggesting that low mood impairs humour appreciation, this seeming to be true even in the case of sick jokes. Apparently it takes a certain amount of intelligence, good mood and calmness to recognise and enjoy the “playful fiction” of black humour.</p>

<p>Chemotherapy during the later stages of pregnancy is generally thought to have no significant detrimental effect on fetal development. As a woman’s reproductive lifespan is determined before birth, it is important to understand the effects of chemotherapy on the ovaries of the developing female fetus.</p>
<figure class="wp-caption alignright" id="attachment_8411" style="width: 209px;"><img alt="Wikimedia, cc" class="wp-image-8411 size-medium" height="300" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2017/01/598px-Maternity_Curves-199x300.jpg" width="199" /><div class="attachment-image--caption">Wikimedia, cc</div><div class="attachment-image--source"></div></figure>
<p>Female egg cells develop from germ cells, which are enclosed within ovarian follicles. Follicle development begins 17 weeks into the pregnancy and is not complete until birth. Researchers used a novel <em>in vitro</em> method of mouse cell culture to investigate the effects of etoposide, an anti-cancer drug, on ovarian development.</p>
<p>It was found that prior to follicle formation, presence of etoposide reduced both follicle production and follicle health. After the complete development of the follicle, etoposide had little effect on follicle health and numbers. Albeit preliminary, these findings suggest that exposure to etoposide could have long term effects on the future fertility of the female fetus, potentially reducing the fertility window and likelihood of conception.</p>

<p>Anchoring molecules which bind phagocytic receptors to the cell surface of tumors enables the immune system to recognize, and attack, tumor cells. This effect can be further optimized by applying LPS, a TLR-4 agonist which is toxic to humans, to the tumor cell surface. <a href="https://bmccancer.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12885-016-2982-x">Caisovà and colleagues present a study</a> conducted to optimize this therapy for human treatment.</p>
<p>A mouse-model which had been transplanted with B16-F10 melanoma cells was used to test several combinations of TLR agonists and phagocytosis-stimulating ligands, to find the most effective treatment with low toxicity to humans.</p>
<p>Of all the combinations studied, it was found that R-848 and covalently anchored mannan-SMCC had the best therapeutic effect, reducing tumor size <em>in vivo</em>. The addition of heat-killed <em>Listeria monocytogenes</em> further increased mouse survival rate to 83.3%. Furthermore, binding of poly(I:C) to tumor cells protected against re-transplantation with no pathological symptoms observed for over a year after treatment.</p>

<p>Mesothelioma is a malignancy of the lung mesothelium cells usually associated with asbestos exposure.

<p>In some malignant cells, <em>HOX</em> genes become dysregulated, increasing cell proliferation. It was shown that treating mesothelioma-derived cell lines with HXR9, a peptide antagonist of HOX protein, leads to tumor cell death (apoptosis) whilst leaving healthy cells intact. Next, HXR9 treatment was tested in mice with mesothelioma. A significant inhibition of the tumor growth was observed, implying that <em>HOX</em> genes may be an important therapeutic target in mesothelioma therapy.</p>

<p>The FC Prostate Community Trial (FCPC) – a randomized, controlled, parallel-group trial currently being conducted in Denmark – aims to determine the effects of recreational football on rehabilitation in men who have been diagnosed with prostate cancer.</p>
<p>Previously, exercise has been shown to improve disease-specific quality of life and reduce treatment-related toxicity in prostate cancer patients. This study investigates the effect of 1 hour of recreational football training sessions twice weekly on cancer-specific quality of life, lean body mass, fat mass, bone mineral density and content, and well-being. The trial is currently ongoing and is expected to be completed in November 2017.</p>

<p>Different drugs elicit a different response depending on the patient; understanding the reasons for this may not only improve treatment, but the development of future anti-cancer drugs. Tailoring treatment to the individual ensures the optimum patient response, reducing disease progression and drug toxicity. Currently, using biomarkers to tailor cancer therapy focuses on the prognosis and prediction of disease.</p>
<p><a href="http://bmccancer.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12885-016-2886-9">A review by Shahil Amin and Oliver Bathe</a> discusses the potential of using biomarkers in an alternative way, to assess a patients’ response to treatment. The authors explore the implications of treatment response biomarkers which, they argue, may not only benefit individual patients, by minimizing exposure to drugs which may be ineffective or toxic, but could also revolutionize how drugs are developed and clinical trials are conducted.</p>

<p>A meta-analysis and systematic review by Zhao et al. identifies a significant dose-response relationship between alcohol intake and risk of developing prostate cancer. The study aimed to reduce misclassification error, which occurs when participants who are defined as non-drinkers may have consumed alcohol regularly in the past. The study showed that when misclassification error is eliminated, there is a significant increase in prostate cancer risk in low-moderate drinkers when compared to those who abstain from alcohol.</p>
<figure class="wp-caption alignleft" id="attachment_8415" style="width: 210px;"><img alt="dilettantiquity, Flickr, cc." class="size-medium wp-image-8415" height="300" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2017/01/3434492702_d3bc6ef921_o-200x300.jpg" width="200" /><div class="attachment-image--caption">dilettantiquity, Flickr, cc.</div><div class="attachment-image--source"></div></figure>
<p>In studies with no misclassification error, an alcohol consumption of 1.3-24mg per day may increase prostate cancer risk by as much as 24%. This presents an increase in 16% when compared to studies which include former drinkers in the abstinence group. As well as providing important data regarding the long term effects low alcohol consumption has on health, this study highlights the effect misclassification errors can have on data.</p>

<p>British workers spend on average one hour commuting each day, and 57 per cent of commuters make their daily journeys by car. But this is a part of our lives we don’t talk much about, beyond the odd epithet about the traffic; maybe because it’s a strange time, betwixt home and work but not fully either. Potentially, the drive to work is a haven: I recall my mother’s glove compartment crammed with audio books, so she could enjoy those stretches of solo time. But it’s more liable to be caught in a crossfire of worries, fretting about Daniel’s pensive moods at the breakfast table, or anticipating criticisms about the last sales pitch. <a href="http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/1359432X.2016.1228628">New research</a> from the University of Haifa suggests these psychological stressors can make our time on the road not just unpleasant, but dangerous as well.</p>
<p><span id="more-17175"></span></p>
<p>Keren Turgeman-Lupo and Michal Biron collected data from 216 employees at a manufacturing organisation (average age 35, with an average driving commute of 16 miles). They surveyed the employees about what they believed was generally seen as acceptable behaviour when on the road, such as whether it is okay to receive phone calls or texts or to let your attention wander to non-driving concerns. Participants also reported how often they committed dangerous driving behaviours such as overtaking on the inside lane or driving too close to the vehicle ahead. Participants who believed less safe driving-related habits were normal and acceptable also tended to drive more dangerously. But what shaped the commuters’ beliefs?</p>
<p>Turgeman-Lupo and Biron found two types of psychological stress had an influence. The first was the degree of conflict workers said they experienced between their family life and the workplace. Higher work-family conflict was associated with more dangerous driving, and this seemed to be explained through its link to participants’ beliefs about what kinds of driving-related behaviours are acceptable. The commute is a liminal period between home and work, such that thoughts and preoccupations may become especially salient, disrupting attention or even leading commuters to fix things by trying to solve domestic situations through messages or calls.</p>
<p>The other relevant stress factor was supervisor abuse. We know that being given a hard time by a manager impairs attention at work, so these preoccupations could also spill over to the commute. Moreover, evidence suggests that one pernicious effect of supervisor abuse is making people feel that they have to ingratiate themselves to avoid further punishment, which could encourage deliberately diverting their attention towards work issues while working, just to get ahead. As with work-life conflict, participants who reported higher levels of supervisor abuse, such as “my supervisor breaks promises he/she makes” admitted to more dangerous driving thanks to their beliefs about what kind of driving-related habits are normal.</p>
<p>Work-related stress can kill us slowly, but this research warns us of one way it can kill quickly, by siphoning away the mental resources that we need to safely steer tons of metal and glass, at high speeds, through a rapidly shifting landscape. It’s another reason why it’s so important for organisations to have humane management practices, liveable demands on worker time, and procedures to eliminate bullying. And it suggests another role organisations can take: to educate their workforce on safe commuting norms and emphasise their importance. Work should wait for the workplace; leave the commute in peace.</p>

            <p>
 The genome of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) frequently contains deletions of tumour suppressor gene loci, most notably SMAD4, which is homozygously deleted in nearly one-third of cases. As loss of neighbouring housekeeping genes can confer collateral lethality, we sought to determine whether loss of the metabolic gene malic enzyme 2 (ME2) in the SMAD4 locus would create cancer-specific metabolic vulnerability upon targeting of its paralogous isoform ME3. The mitochondrial malic enzymes (ME2 and ME3) are oxidative decarboxylases that catalyse the conversion of malate to pyruvate and are essential for NADPH regeneration and reactive oxygen species homeostasis. Here we show that ME3 depletion selectively kills ME2-null PDAC cells in a manner consistent with an essential function for ME3 in ME2-null cancer cells. Mechanistically, integrated metabolomic and molecular investigation of cells deficient in mitochondrial malic enzymes revealed diminished NADPH production and consequent high levels of reactive oxygen species. These changes activate AMP activated protein kinase (AMPK), which in turn directly suppresses sterol regulatory element-binding protein 1 (SREBP1)-directed transcription of its direct targets including the BCAT2 branched-chain amino acid transaminase 2) gene. BCAT2 catalyses the transfer of the amino group from branched-chain amino acids to α-ketoglutarate (α-KG) thereby regenerating glutamate, which functions in part to support de novo nucleotide synthesis. Thus, mitochondrial malic enzyme deficiency, which results in impaired NADPH production, provides a prime ‘collateral lethality’ therapeutic strategy for the treatment of a substantial fraction of patients diagnosed with this intractable disease.

 Temperate viruses can become dormant in their host cells, a process called lysogeny. In every infection, such viruses decide between the lytic and the lysogenic cycles, that is, whether to replicate and lyse their host or to lysogenize and keep the host viable. Here we show that viruses (phages) of the SPbeta group use a small-molecule communication system to coordinate lysis–lysogeny decisions. During infection of its Bacillus host cell, the phage produces a six amino-acids-long communication peptide that is released into the medium. In subsequent infections, progeny phages measure the concentration of this peptide and lysogenize if the concentration is sufficiently high. We found that different phages encode different versions of the communication peptide, demonstrating a phage-specific peptide communication code for lysogeny decisions. We term this communication system the ‘arbitrium’ system, and further show that it is encoded by three phage genes: aimP, which produces the peptide; aimR, the intracellular peptide receptor; and aimX, a negative regulator of lysogeny. The arbitrium system enables a descendant phage to ‘communicate’ with its predecessors, that is, to estimate the amount of recent previous infections and hence decide whether to employ the lytic or lysogenic cycle.

 Reactive astrocytes are strongly induced by central nervous system (CNS) injury and disease, but their role is poorly understood. Here we show that a subtype of reactive astrocytes, which we termed A1, is induced by classically activated neuroinflammatory microglia. We show that activated microglia induce A1 astrocytes by secreting Il-1α, TNF and C1q, and that these cytokines together are necessary and sufficient to induce A1 astrocytes. A1 astrocytes lose the ability to promote neuronal survival, outgrowth, synaptogenesis and phagocytosis, and induce the death of neurons and oligodendrocytes. Death of axotomized CNS neurons in vivo is prevented when the formation of A1 astrocytes is blocked. Finally, we show that A1 astrocytes are abundant in various human neurodegenerative diseases including Alzheimer’s, Huntington’s and Parkinson’s disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and multiple sclerosis. Taken together these findings help to explain why CNS neurons die after axotomy, strongly suggest that A1 astrocytes contribute to the death of neurons and oligodendrocytes in neurodegenerative disorders, and provide opportunities for the development of new treatments for these diseases.

 Cyclic-nucleotide-gated channels are essential for vision and olfaction. They belong to the voltage-gated ion channel superfamily but their activities are controlled by intracellular cyclic nucleotides instead of transmembrane voltage. Here we report a 3.5-Å-resolution single-particle electron cryo-microscopy structure of a cyclic-nucleotide-gated channel from Caenorhabditis elegans in the cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP)-bound open state. The channel has an unusual voltage-sensor-like domain, accounting for its deficient voltage dependence. A carboxy-terminal linker connecting S6 and the cyclic-nucleotide-binding domain interacts directly with both the voltage-sensor-like domain and the pore domain, forming a gating ring that couples conformational changes triggered by cyclic nucleotide binding to the gate. The selectivity filter is lined by the carboxylate side chains of a functionally important glutamate and three rings of backbone carbonyls. This structure provides a new framework for understanding mechanisms of ion permeation, gating and channelopathy of cyclic-nucleotide-gated channels and cyclic nucleotide modulation of related channels.

 Interleukin-17 (IL-17) is a major pro-inflammatory cytokine: it mediates responses to pathogens or tissue damage, and drives autoimmune diseases. Little is known about its role in the nervous system. Here we show that IL-17 has neuromodulator-like properties in Caenorhabditis elegans. IL-17 can act directly on neurons to alter their response properties and contribution to behaviour. Using unbiased genetic screens, we delineate an IL-17 signalling pathway and show that it acts in the RMG hub interneurons. Disrupting IL-17 signalling reduces RMG responsiveness to input from oxygen sensors, and renders sustained escape from 21% oxygen transient and contingent on additional stimuli. Over-activating IL-17 receptors abnormally heightens responses to 21% oxygen in RMG neurons and whole animals. IL-17 deficiency can be bypassed by optogenetic stimulation of RMG. Inducing IL-17 expression in adults can rescue mutant defects within 6 h. These findings reveal a non-immunological role of IL-17 modulating circuit function and behaviour.

            <p>
 Self-organized regular vegetation patterns are widespread and thought to mediate ecosystem functions such as productivity and robustness, but the mechanisms underlying their origin and maintenance remain disputed. Particularly controversial are landscapes of overdispersed (evenly spaced) elements, such as North American Mima mounds, Brazilian murundus, South African heuweltjies, and, famously, Namibian fairy circles. Two competing hypotheses are currently debated. On the one hand, models of scale-dependent feedbacks, whereby plants facilitate neighbours while competing with distant individuals, can reproduce various regular patterns identified in satellite imagery. Owing to deep theoretical roots and apparent generality, scale-dependent feedbacks are widely viewed as a unifying and near-universal principle of regular-pattern formation despite scant empirical evidence. On the other hand, many overdispersed vegetation patterns worldwide have been attributed to subterranean ecosystem engineers such as termites, ants, and rodents. Although potentially consistent with territorial competition, this interpretation has been challenged theoretically and empirically and (unlike scale-dependent feedbacks) lacks a unifying dynamical theory, fuelling scepticism about its plausibility and generality. Here we provide a general theoretical foundation for self-organization of social-insect colonies, validated using data from four continents, which demonstrates that intraspecific competition between territorial animals can generate the large-scale hexagonal regularity of these patterns. However, this mechanism is not mutually exclusive with scale-dependent feedbacks. Using Namib Desert fairy circles as a case study, we present field data showing that these landscapes exhibit multi-scale patterning—previously undocumented in this system—that cannot be explained by either mechanism in isolation. These multi-scale patterns and other emergent properties, such as enhanced resistance to and recovery from drought, instead arise from dynamic interactions in our theoretical framework, which couples both mechanisms. The potentially global extent of animal-induced regularity in vegetation—which can modulate other patterning processes in functionally important ways—emphasizes the need to integrate multiple mechanisms of ecological self-organization.

<p><em>By</em> <a href="http://www.psychologywriter.org.uk/">Christian Jarrett</a></p>
<p>Between 1837 and 1860 Charles Darwin kept a diary of every book he read, including <em>An Essay on the Principle of Population</em>, <em>Principles of Geology</em> and <em>Vestiges of the Natural History of Creation</em>. There were many others: 687 English non-fiction titles alone, meaning that he averaged one book every ten days. After Darwin finished each one, how did he decide what to read next? In this decision, a scientist like Darwin was confronted with a problem similar to that afflicting the squirrel in search of nuts. Is it better to thoroughly search one area (or topic), or to continually jump to new areas (topics)? Foraging, whether for nuts or information, comes down to a choice between exploitation and exploration. In a <a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0010027716302840">new paper</a> in <em>Cognition</em>, a team led by Jaimie Murdock has analysed the contents of the English non-fiction books Darwin read, and the order he read them in, to find out his favoured information-gathering approach and how it changed over time.</p>
<p><span id="more-16972"></span></p>
<p>The researchers analysed digital versions of 665 of the books Darwin read, counting and categorising the topics mentioned within. From this, they calculated whether each successive book reflected a foray into surprising new territory or a deeper dig into a similar subject area. They found that Darwin began his note-keeping period with a greater emphasis on exploitation, largely tending to master one area at a time, rather than jumping sporadically from topic to topic. Over time, and as we get nearer to his writing of his masterpiece <em>On The Origin of Species</em>, he shifts to a greater emphasis on exploration: more sporadic and surprising jumps to new topics.</p>
<p>This finding is unexpected in the sense that it is usually considered optimal for a forager – be that a squirrel or academic – to show the opposite pattern to Darwin, to scope out many different areas before later zooming in on a particular area for deeper scrutiny. Murdock and his team propose two explanations. First, perhaps Darwin had already shown a stronger emphasis on exploration earlier in his career, before he began keeping a reading diary and so missed by the current analysis. Or second, perhaps Darwin required an earlier phase of exploitation and mastery of narrower areas as a way to build his confidence and hone his abilities.</p>
<p>Another way the researchers approached Darwin’s reading choices was to see whether the order he went from book to book was more surprising, in terms of topic changes, compared with the natural progression of topics as reflected in the order in which books were published. This showed that his chosen journey through the reading material was more exploratory and surprising than the chronological progression of ideas based on publication history. That’s to say, over the course of his career, he deliberately mixed and matched what he read, bringing disparate ideas together, rather than passively encountering new ideas as they emerged.</p>
<p>Lending validity to the new findings are the fact the identified phases of relative exploitation and exploration in Darwin’s reading map well onto the biographical phases in his career. First, as he assembled his research journals from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Darwin#Voyage_of_the_Beagle">the Beagle voyage</a> from 1836 onward, he was in a clear exploitation phase of reading. Then from 1846, he began a period of intense <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Darwin#Geology_books.2C_barnacles.2C_evolutionary_research">research into barnacles</a> (having realised their taxonomic study had been neglected in the literature), and this coincides with a shift in his reading style from exploitation to exploration, especially in the sense of reading books on topics that were new to him compared with his past reading habits. Finally, from 1854, as he began <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Darwin#Publication_of_the_theory_of_natural_selection">preparations for writing <em>Origin</em></a>, Darwin’s reading enters its most exploratory phase, in terms not only of reading topics that were fresh relative to his past reading material, but also literally fresh from one book to the next.</p>
<p>The researchers said their study represented the first time that information theory has been applied in this way to study the reading and research habits of a single individual. In principle, the same kind of analysis could now be applied to any other individual living or dead, for whom their reading history is available. In time it will be fascinating to see what similarities and differences there are between Darwin’s intellectual journey and those embarked upon by others.</p>

<p>Jeb Bush’s failure to secure a Presidential triple-play is memorable perhaps because it’s an exception to a familiar routine: the family dynasty. It’s a routine especially common in the arts, where a writer’s family tree is apt to contain a couple of actors, a director, and maybe a flower arranger to boot. This might simply reflect upbringing – or maybe the powers of nepotism – but creative success also owes to temperament and talents, some of which may have their origins in our genetic makeup. The journal <em>Behavioural Genetics</em> has recently published <a href="http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10519-016-9832-0">a heritability study</a> that explores how deeply a creative vocation sits in our DNA.</p>
<p><span id="more-17072"></span></p>
<p>Mark Roeling and his colleagues at Oxford and Vrije universities, drew on data from the Netherlands Twin Register, covering around 1800 monozygotic (identical) twins who share the same genes, and 1600 dizygotic or non-identical twins who have only 50 per cent of their DNA in common, just like non-twin siblings. The register includes information on the twins’ professions, which were coded as artistic if they fell into the categories of dance, film, music, theatre, visual arts, or writing. This applied to 233 of the individuals on the register.</p>
<p>The question that Roeling and his colleagues were interested in was: if an individual has an artistic profession, how likely is it that their twin does too? If the answer is the same for monozygotic and dizygotic pairs, then this would suggest genes exert no effect on the likelihood of entering a creative career – it’s all nurture. Stronger creative overlap among the identical twins, by contrast, would suggest more of a role for nature.</p>
<p>The team found that there was more similarity in the careers of identical twins than non-identical twins. If one identical twin had a creative career, there was a .68 per cent chance that their sibling would do too (where 1 would mean the other twin always had a creative profession), compared with a probability of just .4 for a creative non-identical twin. This difference between identical and non-identical twins suggests that genes have a fairly large say in whether you go into a creative profession. After adjusting the results using data from non-twin siblings, the researchers estimated that the heritability of being in a creative profession is 0.7: in other words, in attempting to understand why some individuals in the sample ended up in creative careers and others didn’t, the researchers think that 70 per cent of this difference is attributable to genetic influences.</p>
<p>It’s worth looking at other recent studies to put this in context. Also working with data from the Netherlands Twin Register, a different research group led by Anna Vinkhuyzen at VU University <a href="http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10519-009-9260-5/fulltext.html">found</a> high levels of heritability (.83 ) for creative writing, including letters, manuscripts and books, but somewhat lower heritability (.56) for a fairly broad category of ‘arts’ comprising painting and acting. Meanwhile, another group headed by Christian Kandler at Universität Bielefeld used German datasets to find another reasonably large heritability estimate (.62) for “perceived” creativity, that is how highly participants rated themselves as creative or how creative they were rated by their peers.</p>
<p>These earlier findings tended to rely on self-report measures of participants’ thoughts on their own creativity. Kandler found a <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Christian_Kandler/publication/284178757_The_Nature_of_Creativity_The_Roles_of_Genetic_Factors_Personality_Traits_Cognitive_Abilities_and_Environmental_Sources/links/564e326908ae1ef9296c68ab.pdf">much lower heritability</a> of .26 for what he calls “figural” creativity, measured by objective tests, such as completing partial line drawings to create objects judged as especially clear and original. This links into earlier findings that <a href="http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/10400410903579627">suggested there are two dimensions to creativity</a>: one a subjective sense of “being a creative” (or wanting to be), which tends to correlate with higher scores on the personality traits of Openness and Extraversion, and the other, actual creative ability, which tends to correlate with intelligence and can be objectively assessed through tests, such as those used in Kandler’s research on figural creativity.</p>
<p>The current study’s heritability of .70 finds better company among the creativity self-report measures than the much weaker heritability suggested for pure creative ability. This makes it plausible that the substantial influence that genetics appears to have on creative professions may not just be about pure creative ability, but also about the other personal characteristics that are needed to make an artistic life, such as determination and self-belief. Further work that looks at the heritability of artistic attainments would be one way of exploring this, as would looking at time spent on creative pursuits, inside or outside of a main profession. After all, to be creative professionally takes a fair amount of luck and circumstance. To be creative in life, however, just requires you to make it a priority.</p>

            <p>Normal epithelial cells often exert anti-tumour effects against nearby oncogenic cells. In the Drosophila imaginal epithelium, clones of oncogenic cells with loss-of-function mutations in the apico-basal polarity genes scribble or discs large are actively eliminated by cell competition when surrounded by wild-type cells. Although c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) signalling plays a crucial role in this cell elimination, the initial event, which occurs at the interface between normal cells and polarity-deficient cells, has not previously been identified. Here, through a genetic screen in Drosophila, we identify the ligand Sas and the receptor-type tyrosine phosphatase PTP10D as the cell-surface ligand–receptor system that drives tumour-suppressive cell competition. At the interface between the wild-type ‘winner’ and the polarity-deficient ‘loser’ clones, winner cells relocalize Sas to the lateral cell surface, whereas loser cells relocalize PTP10D there. This leads to the trans-activation of Sas–PTP10D signalling in loser cells, which restrains EGFR signalling and thereby enables elevated JNK signalling in loser cells, triggering cell elimination. In the absence of Sas–PTP10D, elevated EGFR signalling in loser cells switches the role of JNK from pro-apoptotic to pro-proliferative by inactivating the Hippo pathway, thereby driving the overgrowth of polarity-deficient cells. These findings uncover the mechanism by which normal epithelial cells recognize oncogenic polarity-deficient neighbours to drive cell competition.</p><p>Nature   <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/nature21033">doi: 10.1038/nature21033</a></p><img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/NatureBiologicalSciencesResearch/~4/fkSiMRLOP6o" width="1" />

 The Southern Ocean houses a diverse and productive community of organisms. Unicellular eukaryotic diatoms are the main primary producers in this environment, where photosynthesis is limited by low concentrations of dissolved iron and large seasonal fluctuations in light, temperature and the extent of sea ice. How diatoms have adapted to this extreme environment is largely unknown. Here we present insights into the genome evolution of a cold-adapted diatom from the Southern Ocean, Fragilariopsis cylindrus, based on a comparison with temperate diatoms. We find that approximately 24.7 per cent of the diploid F. cylindrus genome consists of genetic loci with alleles that are highly divergent (15.1 megabases of the total genome size of 61.1 megabases). These divergent alleles were differentially expressed across environmental conditions, including darkness, low iron, freezing, elevated temperature and increased CO2. Alleles with the largest ratio of non-synonymous to synonymous nucleotide substitutions also show the most pronounced condition-dependent expression, suggesting a correlation between diversifying selection and allelic differentiation. Divergent alleles may be involved in adaptation to environmental fluctuations in the Southern Ocean.

<p>During the ongoing “<a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2016/09/16/ten-famous-psychology-findings-that-its-been-difficult-to-replicate/">replication crisis</a>” in psychology, in which new attempts to reproduce previously published results have frequently failed, a common claim by the authors of the original work has been that those attempting a replication have lacked sufficient experimental expertise. Part of their argument, as explained recently by Shane Bench and his colleagues in <a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S002210311630258X">the <em>Journal of Experimental Social Psychology</em></a>, is that “just as master chess players and seasoned firefighters develop intuitive expertise that aids their decision making, seasoned experimenters may develop intuitive expertise that influences the ‘micro decisions’ they make about study selection … and data collection.”</p>
<p>To see if there really is any link between researcher expertise and the chances of replication success, Bench and his colleagues have analysed the results of the recent “Reproducibility Project” <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2015/08/27/this-is-what-happened-when-psychologists-tried-to-replicate-100-previously-published-findings/">in which 270 psychologists attempted to replicate 100 previous studies</a>, managing a success rate of less than 40 per cent. Bench’s team found that replication researcher team expertise, as measured by first and senior author’s number of prior publications, was indeed correlated with the size of effect obtained in the replication attempt, but there’s more to the story.</p>
<p><span id="more-16906"></span></p>
<p>The correlation between expertise and replication effect size would appear to at least partly vindicate the authors of original studies who have claimed that replication attempts have failed because replication researchers have lacked sufficient expertise. However, there is a twist because Bench and his colleagues also looked to see whether replication researcher expertise correlated with the <em>original</em> effect size found in the research they were attempting to replicate, and they found that it was.</p>
<p>What’s more, the link between replication researcher expertise and replication success evaporated when this other correlation (between replication researcher expertise and strength of the original finding) was taken into account. In other words, it seems that more experienced researchers are more likely to publish successful replications because they tend to choose more robust studies to replicate. Supporting this, there was also evidence that more experienced researchers tended to choose to replicate original studies that were less culturally sensitive, with more obviously generalisable results.</p>
<p>“The current results provocatively suggest” said Bench and his colleagues, “that expertise may not play a role in the execution of replication studies. Rather, expertise contributes to the ability to identify studies that are good candidates for replication.”</p>
<p>Of course, this is not the end of the issue. In the Reproducibility Project, replication teams did not have an entirely free choice of studies to replicate but chose from a pre-selection. It remains to be seen if researcher expertise will have the same relevance in other situations. Also, the current study used a fairly crude method of establishing researcher expertise (they looked at number of previous publications and whether they included data and experiments, but not at the direct relevance of the methods involved). For these reasons and more, Bench and his team admitted that “ironically, these results are themselves ripe for replication in order to truly understand the value of expertise in scientific research.”</p>

<p>Genome-scale models of metabolism (GEM) represent biochemical, genetic and genomic (BiGG) knowledge bases that can be utilised in a wide variety of theoretical and practical computational studies. These may range from the discovery of unidentified metabolic reactions, to the exploration of host/pathogen interactions. Recently, these models have been extended via the incorporation of additional biological information, such as protein structural information, thus giving birth to genome-scale models with protein structures (GEM-PRO).</p>
<figure class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_8401" style="width: 310px;"><img alt="fig2" class="wp-image-8401 size-medium" height="119" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2017/01/fig2-300x119.jpg" width="300" /><div class="attachment-image--caption">Brunk et al 2016</div><div class="attachment-image--source"></div></figure>
<p>This article generates and applies the GEM-PRO methodology on two distinct organisms: <em>Escherichia coli</em> and <em>Thermotoga maritima</em>. It is a multi-scale attempt that creates multiple links between genes (and their products), biochemical reactions and phenotypic functions, that are further enhanced by molecular-level information about individual proteins. Essentially, GEM-PRO lies at the intersection of systems biology and structural biology and offers insight into the physical embodiment of an organism’s genotype.</p>

<p>Planarian flatworms have astonishing regenerative mechanisms in response to their environmental conditions and for that property they have been systematically studied for the past 100+ years. However, currently it is possible to trace their stem cell activity from the gene-level all the way to the organism-level, providing a unique opportunity for a ‘systems biology’ approach.</p>
<p>This article presents a nonlinear dynamical model of the flatworm’s stem cell system incorporating feedback control. It draws conclusions on the dynamics of the size, signaling systems and rates of mortality for the aforementioned animal and builds the foundations for a full conceptual framework for planarian cellular dynamics. Based on this model, the scientific community may begin to understand the mechanisms of cell migration during injury, the characterization of homeostatic levels of differentiated cells, as well as the associated stochastic effects.</p>

<p>The rapid advancement of high throughput technologies, along with the vast amounts of available ‘omics’ data, cultivate the ideal environment for a system-level investigation of pathologies. In this article, Calderone et al. showcase a state-of-the-art algorithm, termed ‘InfoMap’, which is able to exploit network community structures and is built upon network theory fundamentals.</p>
<p>It is applied to two age-related neurodegenerative diseases, Alzheimer’s Disease and Parkinson’s Disease, in order to identify similarities and differences in their respective network proteins and pathways. Significant insights are gained for both known and unknown processes, but particularly with regards to information about mitochondrial dysfunction and metabolism. The remarkable fact about this methodological approach is that it can be applied to the comparison of any pair of biological networks.</p>

<p>The term ‘reproducibility’ is a gray aspect for the computational biology community. Unfortunately, it is often (wrongly) open to interpretation and can have a spectrum of definitions. The authors of this study claim that the most basic form of reproducibility is <em>replicability</em>; the notion that “do other people get exactly the same results when doing exactly the same thing?” (i.e. method replicability). However, true <em>reproducibility</em> requires not only the method but also the phenomenon itself to be reproducible. Finally, when reproducing a software result the ultimate aim it to build on it, so researchers need to also consider the <em>extensibility</em> of their computational method.</p>
<p>The authors present case studies that provide insight on these three aspects. They argue that well-designed software needs to facilitate these aspects in order to ensure the value, quality and assurance of the presented computational work. Finally, specific checklists and recommendation lists are provided to guide researchers, developers and even the community towards improving and ensuring reproducibility in computational biology.</p>

<p>Reproducibility is certainly an issue when it comes to cancer research and that’s due to the heterogeneity of the disease. In biomarker discovery certain patterns of ‘omics’ data in one study may fail to be validated in another. In clinical terms, that can be attributed to a number of factors, ranging from the employed molecular methodology and the existing cancer data sets, all the way to the poorly modular patient diagnosis and the complex dynamics of cancer progression.</p>
<p>Fleck et al propose a novel systematic methodology to infer temporal sequence by integrating gene mutation with gene expression data. They are able to identify a set of mutation events that may eventually lead to changes in the gene expression. Furthermore, this model is specifically tested on both simulated and real breast cancer data from <a href="https://cancergenome.nih.gov/">The Cancer Genome Atlas</a>. Overall, by identifying the groups of genes that change during cancer progression this model may provide superior insight to the aforementioned heterogeneity of cancer, further address clinical questions or even improve the current therapeutic strategies.</p>

<p>The ability to genetically mutate organisms has long been fantasized in the world of science fiction, perhaps the most famous example being the X-men franchise, where a genetic mutation can grant superhuman powers. While scientists have not yet unlocked the genetic code necessary for telekinesis, targeted genetic editing has existed since 1974 to probe and explore genetic functions. Manipulating protein levels and activities is a principal tool in understanding the functions and relationships of the molecular components in cells, but true genetic manipulation to produce a stable transgenic cell line or a true-breeding organism requires far more advanced molecular manipulation, and older techniques are hinder-some to the modern scientist in that they are time and labor intensive, requiring a scientist to screen though generations of organisms, as well as having advanced knowledge of molecular techniques.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><a href="https://bmcmolbiol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12867-016-0061-0"><strong>A straightforward and efficient method for screening for CRISPR/Cas9-mediated gene knockouts without selection</strong></a></p>
<p>The newest tool in the geneticist’s tool box makes use of the clustered, regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)/Cas system, an endogenous adaptive immune system commonly used by bacteria and archaea to counteract “infection” by foreign DNA. This new method dramatically changes the field of molecular biology, and will allow scientists move forward with genetic experimentation in leaps and bounds.</p>
<p>The type II CRISPR/Cas system from <em>Streptococcus pyogenes</em> appears to be particularly well suited for scientists performing genomic editing experiments for a simple reason: a single protein, Cas9, is required for crRNA binding and cleavage, and the RNA components have been engineered into a single guide RNA (sgRNA). Because of this, targeting of nearly any genomic sequence is possible with these two reagents in the cells of interest, and the creation of a knockout line depends solely on DNA cleavage by the Cas endonuclease followed by non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) repair of the site by the cell.</p>
<figure class="wp-caption alignnone" id="attachment_8392" style="width: 727px;"><img class="wp-image-8392 size-full" height="197" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2017/02/CRISPR-Cas9_mode_of_action-1.png" title="Wikimedia commons" width="717" /><div class="attachment-image--caption">CRISPR-Cas9 mode of action (Wikimedia Commons, CC)</div><div class="attachment-image--source"></div></figure>
<p> </p>
<p>When the CRISPR system completes the transfection process, a small, random deletion is often introduced at the repair site, which likely leads to a non-functional protein sequence that can be targeted for nonsense-mediated mRNA decay. The Cas cleavage can also stimulate homology-driven repair based on a supplied DNA template, and allow for larger deletions or insertion of tags and markers, whereas older methods were unable or limited in doing so.</p>
<p>In their article <a href="https://bmcmolbiol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12867-016-0061-0">published</a> in <em>BMC Molecular Biology</em>, Estep and colleagues describe an improved method for clonal screening without selection: using immunoblot analysis, the previous method of isolating clones by performing PCR to amplify DNA followed by sequencing or restriction digestion becomes obsolete. By screening directly for protein production, genetic knockout can be confirmed, and non-specific positive signals (false positives) unrelated to protein function can be avoided. The researchers successfully used this method to rapidly generate genomic mutants.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><a href="https://bmcmolbiol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12867-016-0070-z"><strong>The regulation of nonsense-mediated mRNA decay </strong></a></p>
<p>Scientists have made quite a few breakthroughs with regards to understanding the regulatory processes of mRNA this year. In an article <a href="https://bmcmolbiol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12867-016-0070-z">published</a> in <em>BMC Molecular Biology</em>, Jin and colleges at Huazhong Agricultural University have advanced our understanding of the mechanisms employed for nonsense-mediated mRNA decay, the protein surveillance method that targets and breaks down non-functional mRNA</p>
<p>Nonsense-mediated mRNA decay clears cells of nonfunctional proteins by targeting mRNAs which contain a premature termination codon, which would otherwise be translated into a truncated protein sequence. The cellular mechanism involved in this system is not yet completely understood, though it is known that the transcription regulating protein UPF1 activates mRNA decay by recognizing abnormal translation, by using a protein complex which includes the SMG5 protein. When SMG5 is dephosphorylated it down-regulates nonsense-mediated mRNA decay.</p>
<p>Jin and colleagues discovered that a microRNA, miR-433, can repress the expression of SMG5, and observed a suppression in nonsense-mediated mRNA decay, presenting the possibility of new clinical treatments for various diseases which involve protein coding mutations.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Noncoding microRNAs might just be coding for something after all </strong></p>
<p>The role of microRNA (very short non-coding sequences of RNA also known as miRNA) interactions within the cell is incompletely understood, and deciphering their role oftentimes requires a complex series of experiments to confirm their independent impact on cellular processes. While it is known that miRNA modulates approximately 60% of protein translation and degradation in humans, how this is accomplished is still very much a mystery.</p>
<p>One area of research that featured strongly in <em>BMC Molecular Biology</em> in 2016 was the investigation of miRNA function in organ and tumor development.</p>
<p>In a <a href="https://bmcmolbiol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12867-016-0064-x">series of experiments</a> on mice, Bartram and co-workers at the University of Cologne showed that miRNAs that regulates Pax8 (a transcription factor involved in regulating the genes within the stem cells that ultimately develop into epithelial organs) are<a href="https://bmcmolbiol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12867-016-0064-x"> also involved in hypothyroidism and end-stage renal failure</a>.</p>
<p>Li and colleagues from Chongqing Medical University performed a <a href="https://bmcmolbiol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12867-015-0052-6">series of experiments</a> on human cervical tissue from cervical cancer patients and healthy controls and observed that miRNA-150 regulates the expression of FOXO4, a gene which regulates mitosis during the cell cycle and is <a href="https://bmcmolbiol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12867-015-0052-6">found to increase with the progression of cervical cancer</a>. This new information present a new possible target for cancer treatment therapies.</p>
<p>Both of these studies highlight the important role miRNA plays in regulating multiple aspects of the cell cycle, and emphasize how incomplete our knowledge is of these highly important but often overlooked regulatory molecules. Increasingly, however, state of the art techniques are being used to catalogue miRNA abundance in different cell and tissue types. For example, in an article <a href="https://bmcmolbiol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12867-016-0057-9">published</a> in <em>BMC Molecular Biology</em> earlier this year, Tonge and Gant at Keele University reported the global expression levels of all circulating miRNAs within the plasma of normal human subjects, greatly accelerating <a href="https://bmcmolbiol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12867-016-0057-9">future analysis of miRNA function in plasma</a>. By learning of the baseline expressions of human miRNAs, the researchers hope to use this library of over 500 miRNA signatures as baselines for biomarkers. miRNA biomarkers will be particularly useful for identifying organ or system specific protein deregulation or disease since miRNAs are highly specific in location and purpose.</p>
<p>These new discoveries in molecular biology are transforming modern genetics by allowing future genetic modeling and experimentation to be quickly and easily accomplished. Future studies will undoubtedly benefit from these new techniques and discoveries and build from them, allowing scientists to further broaden their horizons in understanding the finer details of our own species.</p>

<p>Our political leanings to the right or left reveal a fundamental aspect of our psyche: how much we’re drawn to stability and security versus change and uncertainty. This manifests in our attitudes and personality traits. For instance, on average, conservatives tend to prefer established hierarchy and are more conscientious. Liberals favour equality and are more open to new experiences. Now in the journal <em>Political Psychology</em> a group led by Aleksandra Cichocka at the University of Kent has <a href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/pops.12327/abstract?campaign=woletoc">extended this line of work</a> by showing the link between political orientation and desire for certainty is reflected at even the most basic of levels: how much we like to use nouns.</p>
<p>Across two initial studies, featuring Polish-speaking survey participants in Poland and Arabic-speaking participants in the Lebanon, the research showed that people with more socially conservative leanings tended to favour nouns over adjectives. For instance, participants with a conservative orientation were more likely to say they’d choose to end the sentence “Magda had no doubts about the success of her business. Magda …” with the noun phrase “is an optimist” than with the adjective phrase “is optimistic”.</p>
<p>This fits with the established link between having a conservative orientation and desiring stability because using a noun to describe someone implies more certainty and permanence about their state of being (past research has shown that even five-year-olds infer more permanence from noun descriptions than adjectival descriptions). Indeed, in the new surveys, the link between conservatism and noun preference seemed to be explained by participants’ relative “need for structure” with high scorers on this measure expressing a dislike of ambiguity.</p>
<p>Cichocka and her colleagues, including John Jost at New York University who is responsible for much of the research in this field, also analysed 101 key speeches delivered by 13 US Presidents, from Roosevelt’s Inaugural Address through to Obama’s State of the Union Address in 2014. They found speeches by Republican presidents featured a greater proportion of nouns compared with their Democrat counterparts.</p>
<p>Overall, the researchers said their results “are compatible with previous work suggesting that language reflects, among other things, the individual’s goals and motives, including his or her political goals.”</p>
