<p>Recognition of microbial pathogens is key for innate immune function. This is done in macrophages by intracellular receptors known as NLRs, which then activate the inflammasome to defend against colonization by intracellular bacteria. Salmonella, however, has developed effectors that allow it to evade the inflammasome response. This study used recombinant Salmonella to test whether inflammasome activation could be triggered and whether that would affect bacterial colonization in vivo in mice. It was found that the recombinant bacteria increased activation of the inflammasome, thereby reducing bacterial counts and organ damage in the infected mice. This could lead to general application in vaccine design, encouraging activation of the immune system against a range of intracellular pathogens.</p>

<p>Interpretation of facial expression is an important element of regulating social interaction. A recent study compared hostile attribution bias in violent criminals as compared to non-violent offenders and controls in the general population. Hostile attribution bias is the interpretation of ambiguous facial expressions as hostile, often leading to aggressive behavior. Violent offenders showed greater hostile attribution bias than non-violent offenders or controls, suggesting one mechanism underlying a tendency towards physical violence.</p>

<p>As electronic health record (EHR) use becomes more common, more negative effects are seen on the physician-patient relationship from the use of EHR. While several recommendations have been published to try to mitigate these effects, few studies have tested whether these recommendations are helpful in real patient interactions. A new study aimed to introduce training on EHR-related communication skills of residents with real patients and asses its impact on physician-patient interactions. After the training, physicians said that they were more comfortable using EHR overall and were seen to be using it less in situations where patients might feel that it was a barrier to communication.</p>

<p>One method of overcoming the growing problem of antibiotic resistance is the use of combination therapies, two or more antibiotic drugs together. Identifying which drugs are most effective together is complicated by the rare occurrence of suppressive interactions, in which the drugs together are less effective than either alone. These suppressive combinations, while they are less effective at killing bacteria, may be better for combating the development of antibiotic resistance. This study looked for suppressive interactions in three-drug combinations, especially “emergent” suppressive interactions that reduce growth better than the single drugs but not as well as the pairwise combinations. Fourteen antibiotic drugs were tested in all possible combinations on three strains of bacteria. Pairwise suppressive interactions were rare, with only 5% of combinations failing to reduce growth more than the single drugs but 17% of three-drug combinations showing suppressive interaction as compared to the pairwise combinations. These emergent suppressive interactions may be clinically useful to balance between the needs of effective killing of bacteria in an individual patient and reducing the development of antibiotic resistance across a population.</p>

<p>The plant cuticle is the outermost tissue layer and it is important in protecting the plant from environmental stresses, such as drought. Cuticle properties such as wax composition and glaucousness may control water loss and thereby contribute to drought tolerance. A new study examined water loss in five strains of wheat to compare leaf cuticle properties between strains with different drought tolerances and within strains grown in drought and non-drought conditions. The relationship found between cuticle properties and drought tolerance was not simple and included changes in wax composition, amount, and crystal structure. These relationships could be useful for selecting plants with higher drought resistance.</p>

<p>Sleep is an essential contributor to healthy child development and lack of sleep can contribute to obesity, low academic achievement, and other negative outcomes for children and their families. Parental behaviors can significantly influence child sleep quality and duration both positively and negatively. This study aimed to determine the relative contribution of various parental behaviors intended to support healthy sleep to children meeting healthy sleep guidelines. The results of the survey show that parental enforcement of bedtime rules, not just encouragement to follow routine, predicted increased sleep duration in children.</p>

<p><em>By</em> <a href="http://www.alexfradera.net/">Alex Fradera</a></p>
<p>In the early 1950s, while investigating rabbits’ sense of smell by recording the activity of their brain cells, the scientist Lord Adrian noticed something curious. As his team mixed up odours of increasing strength, to see at what point the rabbits’ neurons fired in response, they found the critical threshold appeared around the same point that they were able to smell the odour themselves: in other words, this suggested that the smell had become noticeable to animal and man at the same time.</p>
<p>On publication of the research, Lord Adrian mentioned his observation, but it didn’t provoke a serious response, presumably because informed scientists knew that the human sense of smell is generally pathetic. Everyone knew… but they knew wrong. In a new <a href="http://science.sciencemag.org/content/356/6338/eaam7263.full">review</a> in <i>Science</i>, John McGann, who runs the Rutgers Laboratory on the Neurobiology of Sensory Cognition, takes us through the historical misunderstandings to reach the truth about what the human nose knows.</p>

<p>The history of the idea that humans can’t smell very well begins with the French neuroanatomist Paul Broca (immortalised through <a href="http://https//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Broca%25252527s_area">Broca’s</a> brain area), who, facing hostility from the Catholic Church, was defiantly set on making the case for a unique human intelligence that wasn’t due to an invisible soul, but to physical brain features, specifically our large frontal lobes.</p>
<p>To tighten his story, Broca suggested that, in humans, the notably small brain volume taken up by the olfactory bulb, which processes smell (biologists call the sense of smell “olfaction”), reflected a redirection of resources from smell, which guides lower animals, into the higher functions. His argument gained intuitive strength from the fact that in humans the small bulb sits directly against the expanded frontal area. This supported the idea that a poor human sense of smell testifies to human exceptionalism, to our separation from the lowly beast. You can also see this theme in Freud’s work: he claimed smell was connected to instinctual sexual behaviour, and that although it was “usually atrophied” in humans, it connected us “to early animal forms of life.”</p>
<p>But Broca’s original neuroanatomical case doesn’t hold much water. Yes, the human olfactory bulb is small compared to the rest of our (relatively large) brain, but the same is true in other animals. Although across the animal kingdom the brain scales up in relation to body size (larger animals require larger somatosensory systems to represent their greater skin surface, which is why elephants and whales have enormous brains), the olfactory bulb is an important exception to this rule. This might be because however big or small you are, smell always begins at the nostrils.</p>
<p>A different indicator of smell specialisation could be the density of neurons in the olfactory bulb, but this density doesn’t vary greatly from species to species either, and what difference there is doesn’t give us a clear picture: although the bulb of a mouse is neurally denser than that of a human male, it’s less dense than that of a human female.</p>
<p>Admittedly, there are differences in the human olfactory system compared with other animals: for instance, a lack of adult neurogenesis in the olfactory bulb (in humans the growth of new neurons occurs in other regions including the hippocampus and striatum). This could be taken as evidence of less “plasticity” in the human smell system. However, humans appear well-able to adjust and learn to pick up even previously imperceptible smells, for example <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18369149">through aversive conditioning</a>, possibly through reuse of the existing neural resources. So the neuroanatomical evidence that we have feeble odour-detecting isn’t compelling.</p>
<p>Yet the proof is in the smelling. But before you picture the trusted tracker dog, or mouse questing for cheese, ask yourself whether they, like some humans, would be able to distinguish own-brand from top-end potato crisps, or tell a Merlot from a Pinot Noir. Because the truth is, Lord Adrian’s observation reflects a wider truth: while in some instances our sense of smell falls well behind other mammals, in others, it proves itself a match, and in others still, comes out the winner.</p>
<p>As McGann points out, “humans with intact olfactory systems can detect virtually all volatile chemicals larger than an atom or two, to the point that it has been a matter of scientific interest to document the few odorants that some people cannot smell.” Recent research suggests we may be able to theoretically distinguish between, not thousands of different odorants, but up to a <a href="http://https//www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24653035">trillion</a>! The exact smell matter is critical. For example, on two chemically related compounds, humans outperformed mice on one, but lagged behind them on another.</p>
<p>On reflection, this tallies well with the human experience. It’s clear that, like <a href="http://https//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_Search_of_Lost_Time%2523Memory">Proust’s experience with his madeleine cake</a>, smell has a great power <a href="http://https//www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24575071">to evoke memory</a>; that it guides matters of <a href="http://https//www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25637403">physical attraction</a>; that it can tip us off to <a href="http://https//www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3309140/">someone’s emotional state</a>. The texts that once categorised us as an “anosmatic” species – without smell, like dolphins and whales – got it way wrong, brought off course by ideology and a reluctance to actually look at the facts. Luckily, many scientists since have gone on to do the necessary work, by following their noses.</p>

<img alt="" class="attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image" height="110" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2017/06/maxpixel.freegreatpicture.com-Dog-Walking-Animal-Dogs-Pet-Walking-Dog-Walk-1070076-140x110.jpg" style="display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;" width="140" /><p>You could attribute many of a dog’s characteristics to why they’re known as “man’s best friend.”</p>
<p>They’re loyal, entertaining, trustworthy — they won’t tell a soul how long you binge-watched Netflix last weekend — and of course, they’re adorable. But when you’re not cuddled up together streaming shows, dogs can give their owners one of the greatest gifts of all: improved health.</p>
<p>Scientists have studied the influence of dog ownership on physical activity many times, and almost every study has found the same to be true: Owning a dog will cause a person’s activity level to increase and be higher in comparison to those who don’t have a dog.</p>
<h3><strong>The average dog owner walks more than non-owners</strong></h3>
<blockquote><p>Glasgow Caledonian University researchers found dog owners in this age range spent 22 minutes more walking and took around 2,760 extra steps every day.</p></blockquote>
<p>This one might seem obvious, but having a dog essentially forces owners to exercise more than they might have without a pet. This statistic appears to hold true, especially regarding owners ages 65 and up. As <a href="http://www.worldatlas.com/articles/countries-with-the-largest-aging-population-in-the-world.html">populations around the world</a> continue to age, keeping older people active could be imperative to countries’ continued economic growth and the daily functioning of societies.</p>
<p><a href="https://bmcpublichealth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12889-017-4422-5">Glasgow Caledonian University researchers</a> found dog owners in this age range spent 22 minutes more walking and took around 2,760 extra steps every day.</p>
<p>In addition to spending more of their time walking, the study found dog owners had less frequent sedentary periods than non-dog owners. Though the amount of time spent sitting down was the same among the two groups, simply getting up and moving more frequently is enough to boost your physical and mental health.</p>
<p>To collect this data, researchers used a case-controlled design in which study participants were matched using a range of demographic variables. Participants were recruited using ads at local community groups, veterinary offices and local radio and press outlets.</p>
<p>The final sample size included 40 adults aged 65 and older, who resided at private residences and had no scheduled health interventions that could bias their physical activity during the study.</p>
<h3><strong>Dogs encourage people with medical conditions to get outside</strong></h3>
<p><img alt="" class="size-medium wp-image-9145 alignright" height="249" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2017/06/34414326953_747d49f1a9_z-2-300x249.jpg" width="300" />For individuals who have medical conditions that could act up at any time, simply going outside for a walk could be nerve-wracking. If this is you, consider choosing a service dog as your pet. These animals not only provide the same benefits as an ordinary pet, but they also give their owners feelings of independence, courage and peace.</p>
<p>Service dogs could be helpful for people with autism, diabetes, vision impairments, deafness and more. There are even dogs <a href="http://k94life.org/seizure-alert/">trained to help people</a> who suffer from seizures. Individuals who suffer from emotional problems such as panic attacks, separation anxiety, depression or dyslexia could find that service dogs can improve their quality of life too.</p>
<h3><strong>The bottom line: dogs motivate owners to exercise</strong></h3>
<p>If you’ve been feeling like you need a reason to get up and move — and you’re potentially a bit lonely — getting a dog could be beneficial to you. Of course you should always consider whether you are in a position to <a href="https://www.pdsa.org.uk/taking-care-of-your-pet/choosing-a-pet">appropriately care</a> for a potential pet’s needs.</p>
<p>Along with the unconditional love and new adventures your new four-legged friend will bring into your life, you’ll most likely be exercising more frequently and improving both of your well-beings. Now, that’s love.</p>

<img alt="" class="attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image" height="110" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2017/06/1280px-Water_snail_Rex_2-140x110.jpg" style="display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;" width="140" /><p>Populations of numerous species are currently threatened by global climate change. Many species have already shown range shifts as a response to changing climatic conditions. This can increase their probability to survive in the future. However, many species are not able to disperse as effectively as required, and even those that can will experience new and often suboptimal environmental conditions outside their current range.</p>
<p>Owing to the limitations of “quick fixes” in front of climate change, the persistence of natural populations of many organisms will depend on their ability to evolutionarily adapt to changing climatic conditions to overcome their negative effects.</p>
<p>Unfortunately evolutionary adaptation is never guaranteed. A prerequisite for evolutionary change is within-population heritable variation across individuals in the traits determining fitness (i.e. survival and reproductive success). In case of climate change, this would mean that the harmful effects of altered climatic conditions (e.g. heat waves, droughts) on natural populations would become smaller in the future only if (1) individuals showed variation in their sensitivity to climate change-mediated stress, (2) this helped them to produce more offspring compared with other individuals in the population, and (3) also their offspring showed higher tolerance to altered climatic conditions.</p>

<p>We examined the adaptive potential in responses to heat waves in a population of the great pond snail (<em>Lymnaea stagnalis</em>). These snails are common in freshwater habitats across the northern hemisphere. They are important grazers in their habitats, and serve as intermediate hosts for a community of parasites some of which cause wide losses, for instance, in aquaculture. Thus, their responses and potential for adaptation to climate change can have wide consequences for ecosystem functioning and disease epidemiology in freshwater systems.</p>
<p>By exposing snails to experimental heat waves in a laboratory we found that at high temperatures, snails grew larger and reproduced more while their immune defence (two out of three examined immune traits) was reduced. Thus, snails gained immediate benefits in form of high growth rate and reproductive output during a heat wave, but this came with a cost of reduced parasite resistance. Could the snails evolve to experience smaller costs during future heat waves?</p>
<p>Examining snails from different families within the population revealed that although the investigated traits showed high genetic variation, their responses to high temperature were largely similar. Only one of the studied immune traits showed variation across families in its reduction under a heat wave. Therefore, individuals whose immune function suffered the least from high temperature could pass this ability to future generations.</p>
<p>Our findings suggest that snails show some genetic potential for adaptation to climate change. This may reduce the negative effects of heat waves on snail resistance against parasites in the future, thus reducing the disease risk induced by extreme weather conditions. These effects were, however, limited since most of the examined traits did not show such variation.</p>

                <h4><a href="http://blog.ketyov.com/2014/06/the-language-of-peer-review.html">The Language of Peer Review</a></h4>

When I sent off the draft of my first paper to my PhD advisor I really felt like all the hard work was finished. I'd spent years getting my project started: getting IRB approval, identifying subjects, collecting data, and so on. Then I spent many more months analyzing the data, pouring over every detail. Then I spent many more months putting together figures and writing the draft.<br /><br />But all of that?<br /><br />That's only the tip of the iceberg. Let's get into my personal statistics (since those are the data from which I have to draw) to show you the language of peer review.<br /><br />Over the past few years I've been co-author on 15 research manuscripts, of which I have been the main author on 7. I currently have 3 more that have undergone at least one round of peer review. These 10 first-author manuscripts have <i>collectively</i> undergone about 20 rounds of review, each consisting of 2-4 reviewers.<br /><br />More than 16,000 words have been written by reviewers about these 10 papers. In response to <i>them</i>, I have written over 14,000 more.<br /><br />Of note, the total word length for all 10 of these papers comes in at around 40,000 or so (not including references). This means that, for every paper I write, I will probably have to write around 35% <i>more</i> than what I consider to be the "final" version in order to justify its publication to reviewers.<br /><br />Keep that in mind next time you try to estimate how much longer it will take for you to publish your manuscript. I often forget this.<br /><br />Now, on the flip side, I've performed approximately 25 reviews for some of the most prestigious journals in cognitive neuroscience including: <i>Nature</i>, <i>PNAS</i>, <i>Nature Neuroscience</i>, <i>Neuron</i>, <i>Journal of Neuroscience</i>, <i>Neurology</i>, <i>NeuroImage</i>, <i>Journal of Cognitive Neuroscience</i>, <i>Cerebral Cortex</i>,<i> </i>and so on.<br /><br />For these 25 reviews I have written over 14,000 words. That may seem light at only ~560 words per review but my personal reviewing philosophy is to be concise but thorough. It is much easier to critique than to create!<br /><br />If you have not experienced it, peer review is a strange affair. It's sort of like a masquerade ball in that peoples' identities are unknown (at least in one direction), but you know that you'll probably have to see these people unmasked at some point so you better give the appearance of propriety.<br /><br />There's a lot of weird and interesting language play and kowtowing, with phrases such as "we thank the reviewers for their insightful comments" and "this is a very interesting manuscript, but..."<br /><br />The word of the day is "<a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/asteism" target="_blank">asteism</a>": "Polite irony; a genteel and ingenious manner of deriding another."<br /><br />This generally sums up the peer-review process.<br /><br />Just out of curiosity I decided to run all my reviews, comments received by reviewers, and response to reviewers through a tag cloud generator (thank you <a href="http://tagcrowd.com/" target="_blank">tagcrowd</a>) just to see what it looked like. Check it out, I believe this to be a decent, quick insight into the language of peer-review.<br /><br /><b>My Reviews</b><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-pZ3as2idf3M/T1VfSmCsKbI/AAAAAAAAECE/rJ6RcTSJI-g/s1600/bradley_voytek-reviews.jpg" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="182" src="https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-pZ3as2idf3M/T1VfSmCsKbI/AAAAAAAAECE/rJ6RcTSJI-g/s400/bradley_voytek-reviews.jpg" width="400" /></a></div>You'll notice right away that certain keywords appear that represent the general class of manuscripts I'm asked to review: "EEG", "coupling", "gamma", "patients", and so on. The appearance of words such as "addressed", "important", and "interesting" belie the kinds of language I use (I generally <i>do</i> find most papers I review to be genuinely interesting, by the way).<br /><b><br /></b><b>Comments Received by Reviewers</b><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-iDB1MAllh5I/T1WIZJTpHCI/AAAAAAAAECM/IBFCNxc-wH4/s1600/bradley_voytek-reviewer_comments.jpg" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="140" src="https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-iDB1MAllh5I/T1WIZJTpHCI/AAAAAAAAECM/IBFCNxc-wH4/s400/bradley_voytek-reviewer_comments.jpg" width="400" /></a></div><br />Here again you see "interesting" appear. Everyone is interesting! We're all special snowflakes!<br /><br />This is a good exercise for me though because I can see that reviewers have a tendency to use words like "specific" and "literature" against me. When I write I have a tendency to "jump ahead" and just assume that people will follow my logic without "showing my work". This is sloppy on my part and I struggle with the need to explicitly connect my thoughts.<br /><br />My wife has to remind me of this fact for every. Single. Paper. That I write. For every talk I give. You'd think I'd have learned my lesson by now.<br /><b><br /></b><b>Response to Reviewers</b><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-vly8NYaRXnk/T1WIf_pl-pI/AAAAAAAAECU/GGpmC-k6NHg/s1600/bradley_voytek-response_to_reviewers.jpg" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="172" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-vly8NYaRXnk/T1WIf_pl-pI/AAAAAAAAECU/GGpmC-k6NHg/s400/bradley_voytek-response_to_reviewers.jpg" width="400" /></a></div><br />This is great. You see how "reviewer", "correct", "thank", and "suggested" show up a lot in my response to reviewers? This is another interesting aspect of peer review. This shows the deferential language that scientists use in responding to their peers. This represents all the times I've said, "the reviewer is correct" and "we thank the reviewers for their suggestions" and the like.<br /><br />Anyway, this was my attempt to peel back the curtain on peer review a bit if you don't have a lot of experience with it.<br /><br />I don't have a clever or insightful ending for this post, so, uh, I'd like to thank the readers for their valuable time and for the intelligent, thought-provoking comments that are sure to follow.

<img alt="" class="attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image" height="110" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2017/06/wine-140x110.jpg" style="display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;" width="140" /><p>Alcohol plays an important part in the social life of humans, and from early life on. Any minor and major life event is celebrated with alcohol, and many friendships and business deals are formed over a drink. However, the strong role that alcohol plays in our daily life might make it difficult to objectively assess its less positive effects on us, such as its influence on health.</p>
<p>While drinking large amounts of alcohol is generally considered bad for one’s health, it has also been assumed that moderate consumption could pose health benefits. There is even scientific evidence suggesting some advantages of moderate alcohol consumption over abstinence, for example in <a href="http://care.diabetesjournals.org/content/28/3/719">reducing the risk for type-2 diabetes</a>. However, in an ambitious 27-year study <a href="https://bmcpublichealth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12889-017-4437-y">published</a> in <em><a href="https://bmcpublichealth.biomedcentral.com/">BMC Public Health</a></em>, Karina Nygren and colleagues from the University of Umeå in Sweden have now refuted this suggestion.</p>
<p>By documenting the drinking habits of more than 800 persons in a mid-sized Swedish community from the age of 16 to the age of 43, the researchers were able to show that medium alcohol consumption did in fact not help to prevent diabetes – the level of glucose in one’s blood (which can be an early indicator for type-2 diabetes risk) was no lower for participants that reported consuming medium amounts of alcohol between the ages 16 to 43 than for those who had only consumed little alcohol in those years.</p>
<p>Interestingly, this study also allowed new insight to how long-term drinking behavior might have different effects on women and men. Although the men included in the study consumed much more alcohol than the women, and more men than women reported binge-drinking, it might be female heavy drinkers that are especially at risk for developing type-2 diabetes.</p>
<p>The women who reportedly drank the highest volumes of alcohol between the ages 16 to 43, and also those who consistently engaged in binge-drinking in that period, showed higher levels of glucose in their blood than women who drank less amounts of alcohol.</p>
<p>This relationship was not affected by whether or not a woman had a high body mass index (BMI) or high blood pressure, which in turn were the two main factors affecting high blood-sugar levels for men. Furthermore, exercise and smoking habits, both in adolescence and in adulthood, had no effect on blood-sugar levels for either men or women.</p>
<p>The longitudinal design of this study made it possible to explore the relationships between drinking behavior and diabetes in a way that was previously not possible, and it highlights the effects of chronic drinking on health. The study has its caveats: for example, it is difficult to say exactly why heavy drinking promotes higher blood-glucose levels without gathering additional data about liver function, insulin resistance or other related factors. Furthermore, the researcher had to estimate the likely alcohol consumption per year, from the interviews that were conducted every 3 to 13 years, which might have led to an over- or underestimation of the true alcohol intake over the years.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, the results presented by Nygren and her colleagues demonstrated that alcohol consumption patterns formed in adolescence may persist into later life and can thus affect the susceptibility for diseases such as diabetes from an early age on. Interventions to reduce binge-drinking and high alcohol consumption are beneficial across all ages but may be especially effective if targeted at young women, to prevent the development of a habit of heavy drinking.</p>

<p>Reading with a young child is important for their language development and early literacy skills. But does it matter if you read from an electronic book (e-book) or traditional print? As any parent knows, toddlers are generally keen on screens. So the finding, from a <a href="http://journal.frontiersin.org/article/10.3389/fpsyg.2017.00677/full?utm_source=F-AAE&amp;utm_medium=EMLF&amp;utm_campaign=MRK_275249_69_Psycho_20170518_arts_A">new study</a> in <em>Frontiers in Psychology</em>, that very young children enjoy e-books more than print picture books, may not come as a huge surprise – but these additional findings might: both parents and toddlers behaved differently when reading electronic vs. print picture books. And the toddlers who read the e-books learned more.</p>
<p><span id="more-25175"></span></p>
<p>Studies of children aged three and up have suggested that e-books – with their extra features, such as built-in dictionaries and animations of story events – may have advantages over print. A recent meta-analysis found that e-books support story comprehension and vocabulary gains beyond that provided by print books, for example. But there’s also work suggesting that children sometimes invest less mental effort in learning from iPads than print, and that parents talk less about content when sharing an e-book – and there’s been very little research at all in this area on children under two.</p>
<p>For the new research, Gabrielle Strouse at the University of South Dakota, US, and Patricia Ganea at the University of Toronto, Canada, videoed 102 toddlers aged 17-26 months reading with one of their parents. Each parent-child pair was randomly assigned to read either two 10-page commercially-available educational e-books (one about farm animals, the other about wild animals; both downloaded to a handheld device) or two print books with the same content. While the parent read the words in the print books aloud, the e-books had an automatic voiceover.</p>
<p>When they analysed the videos later, Strouse and Ganea found that parents who read the print books pointed more frequently to pages than parents who read the e-books. But the opposite was true for the children. Toddlers who read the e-books also commented more on the content and turned more pages by themselves. “Taken together, it appeared that children were very communicative regarding the electronic books, indicating an interest in their content and a desire to share this interest,” the researchers said.</p>
<p>Before the reading sessions, the researchers had asked the parents to list how many of the animal names in both books their child already knew and understood. After the sessions, the children who’d read the e-books were better at identifying previously unfamiliar animals.</p>
<p>The toddlers who read ebooks were also rated as being more engaged, as paying more attention, and as enjoying the experience more. And according to the analysis, it was “availability for reading” – being “present” and engaged – that was associated with the superior learning results for e-books vs. print.</p>
<p>One important point to note is that the e-books were simple. While they included background music, animation and sound effects, there were no “hotspots” – parts of the screen that, when tapped, trigger extra features, for example.</p>
<p>In fact, while extra e-book enhancements can certainly engage a child, there’s research in older children finding that they don’t always lead to improved learning. “Bells and whistles in electronic books can be designed in many ways that may increase children’s participation with them, but if these features do not draw attention to the educational content they may not serve as a supportive feature,” Strouse and Ganea warned in their paper, before concluding: “Much more work is needed to determine the potential benefits and hazards of new media.”</p>

<p>Olfaction in mammals is a dynamic process driven by the inhalation of air
through the nasal cavity. Inhalation determines the temporal structure of
sensory neuron responses and shapes the neural dynamics underlying central
olfactory processing. Inhalation-linked bursts of activity among olfactory bulb
(OB) output neurons [mitral/tufted cells (MCs)] are temporally transformed
relative to those of sensory neurons. We investigated how OB circuits shape
inhalation-driven dynamics in MCs using a modeling approach that was highly
constrained by experimental results. First, we constructed models of canonical
OB circuits that included mono- and disynaptic feedforward excitation,
recurrent inhibition and feedforward inhibition of the MC. We then used
experimental data to drive inputs to the models and to tune parameters; inputs
were derived from sensory neuron responses during natural odorant sampling
(sniffing) in awake rats, and model output was compared with recordings of MC
responses to odorants sampled with the same sniff waveforms. This approach
allowed us to identify OB circuit features underlying the temporal
transformation of sensory inputs into inhalation-linked patterns of MC spike
output. We found that realistic input-output transformations can be achieved
independently by multiple circuits, including feedforward inhibition with slow
onset and decay kinetics and parallel feedforward MC excitation mediated by
external tufted cells. We also found that recurrent and feedforward inhibition
had differential impacts on MC firing rates and on inhalation-linked response
dynamics. These results highlight the importance of investigating neural
circuits in a naturalistic context and provide a framework for further
explorations of signal processing by OB networks.</p>

<p>If there’s one quality you absolutely want in a leader, it’s surely charisma. Celebrated leaders are invariably associated with this magic word, and <a href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/1099-1379(200011)21:7%2525253C747::AID-JOB46%2525253E3.0.CO%253B2-J/abstract">evidence suggests</a> charismatic people inspire more trust, commitment, and results from their followers. But across a number of other supposedly virtuous traits, such as <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2015/08/17/having-strong-political-skills-can-be-a-handicap-in-the-workplace/">political ability</a> or assertiveness (<a href="https://www0.gsb.columbia.edu/mygsb/faculty/research/pubfiles/1887/ames_assertiveness_jpsp.pdf">pdf</a>), researchers are starting to realise that it’s possible to have “too much of a good thing.” Could charisma fall in that category? That’s the suggestion of <a href="http://psycnet.apa.org/psycinfo/2017-23344-001/">new research</a> in the <em>Journal of Personality and Social Psychology</em>.</p>
<p><span id="more-25148"></span></p>
<p>Jasmine Vergauwe of the University of Ghent and her collaborators began by investigating a mainly American sample, employees in an international aerospace company. They focused on around 300 leaders (supervisors to general managers), two-thirds of them male and typically in their late 40s, who rated themselves on a personality measure focused on capturing charismatic leader qualities. They then rated their own effectiveness as leaders, and the more charismatic they rated themselves, the more effective they believed they were. But when other members of the organisation rated the same leaders, a different picture emerged. Each group – peers, subordinates and managers – described the same pattern: both low-charisma and high-charisma leaders were seen as less effective than those in between. Charisma was useful up to a point, but beyond that, it was counterproductive.</p>
<p>If large doses of charisma are toxic, maybe we can understand why by examining the ingredient list. In the earlier surveys, Vergauwe’s team had used a measure of charismatic personality composed of four aspects: boldness, colour, imagination and mischief. Each has obvious leadership benefits but could also create problems: for example, <i>colourful</i> leaders are extraverted and inspirational, but prefer being in the spotlight to toiling away invisibly on lower-key issues. Similarly, <i>imaginative</i> leaders are visionary and creative, but can tend towards the eccentric and concerning themselves only with the big picture. Vergauwe noted that these negative aspects looked like they could interfere with specific types of leadership activity, and in a second study, the team put this to the test.</p>
<p>Nearly three hundred business leaders from 23 different countries, together with thousands of co-workers, went through a similar rating process as in the first study. This time, however, the measures of leadership effectiveness were more fine-grained, including questions about how the leader treats their staff and how competent they are at organisational strategy and tactics. One hypothesis, that highly charismatic leaders would differ in their treatment of others compared with less charismatic leaders, was not borne out; the researchers thought high charisma would be associated with being more forceful and less enabling, but no such differences emerged.</p>
<p>But when it came to where leaders were putting their focus, the data showed a clear effect. Low-charisma leaders were seen by their staff and colleagues as having too little strategic nous, but no problems with their tactical ability (they could handle the detail but struggled with the big picture). High-charisma leaders, meanwhile, were seen as strategically optimal, but tactically weak (strong on the big picture but weak on detail). Meanwhile, moderate-charisma leaders tended to be viewed as fairly optimal for both strategic and tactical aspects of the job. This suggests that the problem for the highly charismatic isn’t that they are doing too much of anything – over-strategising to the point that it becomes a detriment, for instance – but that they are neglecting other aspects of leadership along the way.</p>
<p>In their search for leaders, organisations are desperate to discover a method, based on particular traits, that ensures they will always strike gold. But wherever they mine, seams that initially appear perfect produce mixed yields, sometimes valuable, sometimes not. Organisations that are mindful of that will do just fine; for instance, knowing that specific blind spots may emerge for charismatic people, you can raise their awareness and develop them into well-balanced leaders. But recruiters who assume that any single quality is pure gold, not realising that under a different light there are copper pyrites in there too, … well, then they’re the fools. And no amount of charismatic figures on their list will make it otherwise.</p>

<img alt="" class="attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image" height="110" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2017/06/famine-140x110.jpg" style="display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;" width="140" /><h3><strong>Dyslipdemia</strong></h3>
<p>Dyslipidemia is an important risk factor of coronary heart disease (CHD), which is one of the leading causes of death in developing and developed countries.</p>
<p>Based on the Chinese national data, the prevalence of dyslipidemia was 26.7% among workers aged 18-59 years in 2012, and was 33.5% among Chinese aged greater than 45-years-old. The emerging pandemic was partially caused by population growth, rapidly aging and changes of diet and lifestyle.</p>
<p>However, recent studies indicated that the early life famine exposure might also increase the later susceptibility to some common chronic diseases, including metabolic syndrome, diabetes, and fatty liver disease.</p>
<h3><strong>Famine exposure</strong></h3>
<blockquote><p>The famine resulted in approximately 30 million premature deaths, and the excess mortality during famine periods was used to reflect the severity of famine exposure.</p></blockquote>
<p>Due to the radical collectivization movement and inclement climate conditions, almost the entirety of Mainland China suffered from extreme food shortage during 1959-1961. The famine severity was different across provinces due to variation of climate, population density, and policies regarding shortage of foods.</p>
<p>The famine resulted in approximately 30 million premature deaths, and the excess mortality during famine periods was used to reflect the severity of famine exposure.</p>
<p>The provinces with excess mortality ≥ 50% were defined as severe famine affected areas; other provinces were defined as less severely affected areas. For example, the excess mortality of Anhui province was the highest, up to 474.9%; Tianjin province was lowest, at only 14.9%.</p>
<h3><strong>The study</strong></h3>
<p>In this study, the dyslipidemia prevalence of the non-exposed cohort, fetal stage, infant stage, and preschool stage-exposed cohorts in adulthood were 15.7%, 23.1%, 22.0%, and 18.6%, respectively. Early-life exposure to the Chinese famine significantly increased LDL cholesterol concentrations in adulthood after adjusting for age.</p>
<blockquote><p>Early-life exposure to the Chinese famine significantly increased LDL cholesterol concentrations in adulthood after adjusting for age.</p></blockquote>
<p>The risks of dyslipidemia in fetal and infant stage-exposed cohorts were significantly higher than the non-exposed cohort after adjusting for gender and current family economic status.</p>
<p>However, following gender stratification, we found that fetal, infant, and preschool stage exposure to severe famine aggravated the risk of dyslipidemia only in female adults; a similar association was not observed for male adults.</p>
<h3><strong>Gender bias? </strong></h3>
<p>We speculated that this gender-specific effect might be associated with the hypothesis that parents in China traditionally prefer boys to girls. In China, male children took precedence over females due to gender bias, and thus they may potentially be sufficiently nourished during the famine.</p>
<p>Additionally, survivor bias may be another reason to interpret the lack of “effect” on males. Prenatal Males were more vulnerable than females to both short and long term effects of famine and die at higher rates. Thus, male survivors could be healthier than female survivors.</p>
<h3><strong>Explaining the link</strong></h3>
<p>Several mechanisms might explain the link in early-life famine exposure and elevated dyslipidemia risk in later life. Firstly, severe maternal under-nutrition during pregnancy could alter the synthesis of cholesterol, increasing the plasma concentration; this has been shown in animal models.</p>
<p>Secondly, individuals who suffered from severe intrauterine malnutrition are more likely to consume a high-fat diet in adulthood while reducing the level of physical activity, thereby increasing atherogenic lipid profile, as observed by a Dutch famine study. In the present study, we did not explore the correlation between famine exposure and dietary and physical behavior due to lack of relevant data.</p>
<blockquote><p>Lipid metabolic gene methylation level may play a pivotal role in malnutrition during pregnancy, which renders it sensitive to abnormal lipid metabolism.</p></blockquote>
<p>Thirdly, lipid metabolic gene methylation level may play a pivotal role in malnutrition during pregnancy, which renders it sensitive to abnormal lipid metabolism. <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/ncomms6592">Elmar et al.</a> comprehensively assessed the associations of prenatal malnutrition and differentially methylated regions (P-DMRs) in humans and found that <em>CPTIA</em> was involved in fatty acid oxidation and <em>KLF13</em> involved in cholesterol metabolism.</p>
<p>The methylation level as one of the principal components of epigenetics, could effectively adjust the expression level of the gene. In addition, epigenetic plasticity may play an important role in the postnatal period and result in “metabolic imprinting” which could be another biological mechanism beneath the association of early life malnutrition with metabolic diseases in adulthood.</p>
<p>Despite China now being food secure, many people are still exposed to food shortages in low-income and middle-income countries. Hence many children are still at short term risk of malnutrition associated mortality and morbidity, but also at long-term risk of adult non-communicable diseases. The heavily short and long-term adverse effects from severe food shortage ask us to implement the urgent interventions to lower their occurrence or improve their consequences.</p>

<p>
 Urinary tract infections (UTIs) caused by uropathogenic Escherichia coli (UPEC) affect 150 million people annually. Despite effective antibiotic therapy, 30–50% of patients experience recurrent UTIs. In addition, the growing prevalence of UPEC that are resistant to last-line antibiotic treatments, and more recently to carbapenems and colistin, make UTI a prime example of the antibiotic-resistance crisis and emphasize the need for new approaches to treat and prevent bacterial infections. UPEC strains establish reservoirs in the gut from which they are shed in the faeces, and can colonize the periurethral area or vagina and subsequently ascend through the urethra to the urinary tract, where they cause UTIs. UPEC isolates encode up to 16 distinct chaperone-usher pathway pili, and each pilus type may enable colonization of a habitat in the host or environment. For example, the type 1 pilus adhesin FimH binds mannose on the bladder surface, and mediates colonization of the bladder. However, little is known about the mechanisms underlying UPEC persistence in the gut. Here, using a mouse model, we show that F17-like and type 1 pili promote intestinal colonization and show distinct binding to epithelial cells distributed along colonic crypts. Phylogenomic and structural analyses reveal that F17-like pili are closely related to pilus types carried by intestinal pathogens, but are restricted to extra-intestinal pathogenic E. coli. Moreover, we show that targeting FimH with M4284, a high-affinity inhibitory mannoside, reduces intestinal colonization of genetically diverse UPEC isolates, while simultaneously treating UTI, without notably disrupting the structural configuration of the gut microbiota. By selectively depleting intestinal UPEC reservoirs, mannosides could markedly reduce the rate of UTIs and recurrent UTIs.

<p>
 In response to environmental cues that promote IP3 (inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate) generation, IP3 receptors (IP3Rs) located on the endoplasmic reticulum allow the ‘quasisynaptical’ feeding of calcium to the mitochondria to promote oxidative phosphorylation. However, persistent Ca2+ release results in mitochondrial Ca2+ overload and consequent apoptosis. Among the three mammalian IP3Rs, IP3R3 appears to be the major player in Ca2+-dependent apoptosis. Here we show that the F-box protein FBXL2 (the receptor subunit of one of 69 human SCF (SKP1, CUL1, F-box protein) ubiquitin ligase complexes) binds IP3R3 and targets it for ubiquitin-, p97- and proteasome-mediated degradation to limit Ca2+ influx into mitochondria. FBXL2-knockdown cells and FBXL2-insensitive IP3R3 mutant knock-in clones display increased cytosolic Ca2+ release from the endoplasmic reticulum and sensitization to Ca2+-dependent apoptotic stimuli. The phosphatase and tensin homologue (PTEN) gene is frequently mutated or lost in human tumours and syndromes that predispose individuals to cancer. We found that PTEN competes with FBXL2 for IP3R3 binding, and the FBXL2-dependent degradation of IP3R3 is accelerated in Pten−/− mouse embryonic fibroblasts and PTEN-null cancer cells. Reconstitution of PTEN-null cells with either wild-type PTEN or a catalytically dead mutant stabilizes IP3R3 and induces persistent Ca2+ mobilization and apoptosis. IP3R3 and PTEN protein levels directly correlate in human prostate cancer. Both in cell culture and xenograft models, a non-degradable IP3R3 mutant sensitizes tumour cells with low or no PTEN expression to photodynamic therapy, which is based on the ability of photosensitizer drugs to cause Ca2+-dependent cytotoxicity after irradiation with visible light. Similarly, disruption of FBXL2 localization with GGTi-2418, a geranylgeranyl transferase inhibitor, sensitizes xenotransplanted tumours to photodynamic therapy. In summary, we identify a novel molecular mechanism that limits mitochondrial Ca2+ overload to prevent cell death. Notably, we provide proof-of-principle that inhibiting IP3R3 degradation in PTEN-deregulated cancers represents a valid therapeutic strategy.

<p>
 Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is an incurable autoimmune disease characterized by autoantibody deposition in tissues such as kidney, skin and lungs. Notably, up to 75% of patients with SLE experience neuropsychiatric symptoms that range from anxiety, depression and cognitive impairment to seizures and, in rare cases, psychosis—collectively this is referred to as central nervous system (CNS) lupus. In some cases, certain autoantibodies, such as anti-NMDAR or anti-phospholipid antibodies, promote CNS lupus. However, in most patients, the mechanisms that underlie these symptoms are unknown. CNS lupus typically presents at lupus diagnosis or within the first year, suggesting that early factors contributing to peripheral autoimmunity may promote CNS lupus symptoms. Here we report behavioural phenotypes and synapse loss in lupus-prone mice that are prevented by blocking type I interferon (IFN) signalling. Furthermore, we show that type I IFN stimulates microglia to become reactive and engulf neuronal and synaptic material in lupus-prone mice. These findings and our observation of increased type I IFN signalling in post-mortem hippocampal brain sections from patients with SLE may instruct the evaluation of ongoing clinical trials of anifrolumab, a type I IFN-receptor antagonist. Moreover, identification of IFN-driven microglia-dependent synapse loss, along with microglia transcriptome data, connects CNS lupus with other CNS diseases and provides an explanation for the neurological symptoms observed in some patients with SLE.

                <h4><a href="http://feeds.nature.com/~r/NatureBiologicalSciencesResearch/~3/bqVQrKGjtkY/nature22820">ERF mutations reveal a balance of ETS factors controlling prostate oncogenesis</a></h4>

<p>
 Half of all prostate cancers are caused by the TMPRSS2–ERG gene-fusion, which enables androgens to drive expression of the normally silent E26 transformation-specific (ETS) transcription factor ERG in prostate cells. Recent genomic landscape studies of such cancers have reported recurrent point mutations and focal deletions of another ETS member, the ETS2 repressor factor ERF. Here we show these ERF mutations cause decreased protein stability and mostly occur in tumours without ERG upregulation. ERF loss recapitulates the morphological and phenotypic features of ERG gain in normal mouse prostate cells, including expansion of the androgen receptor transcriptional repertoire, and ERF has tumour suppressor activity in the same genetic background of Pten loss that yields oncogenic activity by ERG. In the more common scenario of ERG upregulation, chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by sequencing indicates that ERG inhibits the ability of ERF to bind DNA at consensus ETS sites both in normal and in cancerous prostate cells. Consistent with a competition model, ERF overexpression blocks ERG-dependent tumour growth, and ERF loss rescues TMPRSS2–ERG-positive prostate cancer cells from ERG dependency. Collectively, these data provide evidence that the oncogenicity of ERG is mediated, in part, by competition with ERF and they raise the larger question of whether other gain-of-function oncogenic transcription factors might also inactivate endogenous tumour suppressors.

                <h4><a href="http://feeds.nature.com/~r/NatureBiologicalSciencesResearch/~3/8bYlgdJYHvU/nature22819">Histone deacetylase 3 prepares brown adipose tissue for acute thermogenic challenge</a></h4>

<p>
 Brown adipose tissue is a thermogenic organ that dissipates chemical energy as heat to protect animals against hypothermia and to counteract metabolic disease. However, the transcriptional mechanisms that determine the thermogenic capacity of brown adipose tissue before environmental cold are unknown. Here we show that histone deacetylase 3 (HDAC3) is required to activate brown adipose tissue enhancers to ensure thermogenic aptitude. Mice with brown adipose tissue-specific genetic ablation of HDAC3 become severely hypothermic and succumb to acute cold exposure. Uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1) is nearly absent in brown adipose tissue lacking HDAC3, and there is also marked downregulation of mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation genes resulting in diminished mitochondrial respiration. Remarkably, although HDAC3 acts canonically as a transcriptional corepressor, it functions as a coactivator of oestrogen-related receptor α (ERRα) in brown adipose tissue. HDAC3 coactivation of ERRα is mediated by deacetylation of PGC-1α and is required for the transcription of Ucp1, Ppargc1a (encoding PGC-1α), and oxidative phosphorylation genes. Importantly, HDAC3 promotes the basal transcription of these genes independently of adrenergic stimulation. Thus, HDAC3 uniquely primes Ucp1 and the thermogenic transcriptional program to maintain a critical capacity for thermogenesis in brown adipose tissue that can be rapidly engaged upon exposure to dangerously cold temperature.

<p>
 BRCA1-associated protein 1 (BAP1) is a potent tumour suppressor gene that modulates environmental carcinogenesis. All carriers of inherited heterozygous germline BAP1-inactivating mutations (BAP1+/−) developed one and often several BAP1−/− malignancies in their lifetime, mostly malignant mesothelioma, uveal melanoma, and so on. Moreover, BAP1-acquired biallelic mutations are frequent in human cancers. BAP1 tumour suppressor activity has been attributed to its nuclear localization, where it helps to maintain genome integrity. The possible activity of BAP1 in the cytoplasm is unknown. Cells with reduced levels of BAP1 exhibit chromosomal abnormalities and decreased DNA repair by homologous recombination, indicating that BAP1 dosage is critical. Cells with extensive DNA damage should die and not grow into malignancies. Here we discover that BAP1 localizes at the endoplasmic reticulum. Here, it binds, deubiquitylates, and stabilizes type 3 inositol-1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor (IP3R3), modulating calcium (Ca2+) release from the endoplasmic reticulum into the cytosol and mitochondria, promoting apoptosis. Reduced levels of BAP1 in BAP1+/− carriers cause reduction both of IP3R3 levels and of Ca2+ flux, preventing BAP1+/− cells that accumulate DNA damage from executing apoptosis. A higher fraction of cells exposed to either ionizing or ultraviolet radiation, or to asbestos, survive genotoxic stress, resulting in a higher rate of cellular transformation. We propose that the high incidence of cancers in BAP1+/− carriers results from the combined reduced nuclear and cytoplasmic activities of BAP1. Our data provide a mechanistic rationale for the powerful ability of BAP1 to regulate gene–environment interaction in human carcinogenesis.

<p>
 Conventional two-dimensional differentiation from pluripotency fails to recapitulate cell interactions occurring during organogenesis. Three-dimensional organoids generate complex organ-like tissues; however, it is unclear how heterotypic interactions affect lineage identity. Here we use single-cell RNA sequencing to reconstruct hepatocyte-like lineage progression from pluripotency in two-dimensional culture. We then derive three-dimensional liver bud organoids by reconstituting hepatic, stromal, and endothelial interactions, and deconstruct heterogeneity during liver bud development. We find that liver bud hepatoblasts diverge from the two-dimensional lineage, and express epithelial migration signatures characteristic of organ budding. We benchmark three-dimensional liver buds against fetal and adult human liver single-cell RNA sequencing data, and find a striking correspondence between the three-dimensional liver bud and fetal liver cells. We use a receptor–ligand pairing analysis and a high-throughput inhibitor assay to interrogate signalling in liver buds, and show that vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) crosstalk potentiates endothelial network formation and hepatoblast differentiation. Our molecular dissection reveals interlineage communication regulating organoid development, and illuminates previously inaccessible aspects of human liver development.

<p>
 During gestation the developing human fetus is exposed to a diverse range of potentially immune-stimulatory molecules including semi-allogeneic antigens from maternal cells, substances from ingested amniotic fluid, food antigens, and microbes. Yet the capacity of the fetal immune system, including antigen-presenting cells, to detect and respond to such stimuli remains unclear. In particular, dendritic cells, which are crucial for effective immunity and tolerance, remain poorly characterized in the developing fetus. Here we show that subsets of antigen-presenting cells can be identified in fetal tissues and are related to adult populations of antigen-presenting cells. Similar to adult dendritic cells, fetal dendritic cells migrate to lymph nodes and respond to toll-like receptor ligation; however, they differ markedly in their response to allogeneic antigens, strongly promoting regulatory T-cell induction and inhibiting T-cell tumour-necrosis factor-α production through arginase-2 activity. Our results reveal a previously unappreciated role of dendritic cells within the developing fetus and indicate that they mediate homeostatic immune-suppressive responses during gestation.

                <h4><a href="http://feeds.nature.com/~r/NatureBiologicalSciencesResearch/~3/mVAwdP9GJr4/nature22375">Homeostatic circuits selectively gate food cue responses in insular cortex</a></h4>

<p>
 Physiological needs bias perception and attention to relevant sensory cues. This process is ‘hijacked’ by drug addiction, causing cue-induced cravings and relapse. Similarly, its dysregulation contributes to failed diets, obesity, and eating disorders. Neuroimaging studies in humans have implicated insular cortex in these phenomena. However, it remains unclear how ‘cognitive’ cortical representations of motivationally relevant cues are biased by subcortical circuits that drive specific motivational states. Here we develop a microprism-based cellular imaging approach to monitor visual cue responses in the insular cortex of behaving mice across hunger states. Insular cortex neurons demonstrate food-cue-biased responses that are abolished during satiety. Unexpectedly, while multiple satiety-related visceral signals converge in insular cortex, chemogenetic activation of hypothalamic ‘hunger neurons’ (expressing agouti-related peptide (AgRP)) bypasses these signals to restore hunger-like response patterns in insular cortex. Circuit mapping and pathway-specific manipulations uncover a pathway from AgRP neurons to insular cortex via the paraventricular thalamus and basolateral amygdala. These results reveal a neural basis for state-specific biased processing of motivationally relevant cues.

A high-profile paper in Cell reports on a new brain stimulation method that's got many neuroscientists excited. The new technique, called temporal interference (TI) stimulation, is said to be able to reach structures deep inside the brain, using nothing more than scalp electrodes.

Currently, the only way to stimulate deep brain structures is by implanting electrodes (wires) into the brain - which is an expensive and potentially dangerous surgical procedure. TI promises to make deep brain stim

<p><em>By </em><a href="http://www.christianjarrett.com/">Christian Jarrett</a></p>
<p>Heralded as a revolution in mental health care – a cost-effective way to deliver evidence-based psychological help to large numbers – low-intensity Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (CBT) is recommended by NICE, the independent health advisory body in England and Wales, for mild to moderate depression and anxiety and is a key part of the “Improving Access to Psychological Therapies” programme in those countries. Prior studies into its effectiveness have been promising. However, little research has looked at whether the benefits last.</p>
<p>A new <a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0005796717300840?dgcid=raven_sd_via_email">study</a> in <em>Behaviour Research and Therapy</em> has done that, following a cohort of people with depression and anxiety over time. Disappointingly, the team led by Shehzad Ali at the University of York, found that after completing low-intensity CBT, more than one in two service users had relapsed within 12 months.</p>
<p><span id="more-24965"></span></p>
<p>Low-intensity CBT is based on the same principles as full or high-intensity CBT – clients reflect on and strive to change their habits of thought that could be contributing to their mental distress, and they also learn coping strategies and other skills. However, it’s delivered in such a way as to reduce the need for extended one-on-one time with a qualified psychotherapist. It typically incorporates self-help books and internet exercises, usually completed under the guidance of a “well-being practitioner” or coach who is trained to follow a highly structured programme rather than having any formal psychotherapy training.</p>
<p>To test the longer term outcomes for low-intensity CBT, Ali and his colleagues recruited hundreds of people at a primary care service in West Yorkshire in England. The participants were diagnosed with depression or anxiety, or both, and had enrolled in low-intensity CBT. Some dropped out prematurely and were not included in further analysis.</p>
<p>For current purposes, the researchers were interested in the 439 participants who had recovered during their low-intensity CBT (improvements in their symptoms meant they no longer met the diagnosis for anxiety or depression) and who had ended their course of treatment in agreement with their practitioner or coach – on average this was after seven contacts with their practitioner, including the initial assessment. For comparison, high-intensity CBT with a psychotherapist can last up to 20 sessions.</p>
<p>After finishing their low-intensity CBT, the recovered participants (average age 41, 60 per cent were female, over 90 per cent were white British) completed monthly questionnaires that measured their levels of anxiety and depression symptoms. As time went on, an increasing proportion of the participants showed evidence of having relapsed – that is, their symptoms had deteriorated to a point that suggested they would likely be diagnosed as having anxiety or depression again. By twelve months after the end of their low-intensity CBT, nearly 53 per cent had relapsed; half of these relapses had occurred within two months, 80 per cent within six months (for comparison, <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17563164">a meta-analysis of high-intensity CBT</a> found that 29 per cent of recovered clients with depression had relapsed within 12 months, which is <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/m/pubmed/15809409/">a better outcome than for patients who stop taking anti-depressants</a>) .</p>
<p>Is it possible to predict who is likely to relapse? In the current study, recovered participants who still showed some symptoms of depression at the end of their course of low-intensity CBT (but not enough to justify a diagnosis) were far more likely to relapse over the ensuing year. Residual anxiety symptoms were not predictive in this way. The finding for residual depression symptoms suggests many low-intensity CBT users would benefit from some kind of on-going after care, such as booster sessions or other lower-intensity support.</p>
<p>“It seems hasty to consider patients ‘recovered’ at the point of discharge without assessing full remission symptoms over a longer period,” Ali and his colleagues concluded. “It could be argued that many of the relapse cases in this study actually had partial (rather than full) remission at the time of treatment completion, and thus never actually ‘recovered'”.</p>
<p>The findings from this study will fuel the fears of some experts that low-intensity CBT is a form of false economising. It may be quick and cheap but the results suggest that many people are being sent on their way before they are fully recovered.</p>
<p>One counter to that argument is that prior to the roll out of low-intensity CBT, many of the kinds of people who took part in this research (i.e. people with mild to moderate mental health problems) would have received no treatment at all or given powerful drugs. They might have spent months or years on a waiting list for a psychotherapist, during which time their problems may well have worsened. Another point to bear in mind was that this research was conducted in just one service in England, and more research is needed in other areas.</p>
<p>“It is clear that relapse prevention is an overlooked aspect of routine stepped care in Improving Access to Psychological Therapies services and an important area for further policy and research developments,” the researchers said.</p>

                <h4><a href="http://blog.ketyov.com/2013/08/the-prodigy-effect.html">The Prodigy Effect</a></h4>

This post might turn into a collaborative research project. If you're a data person, or an experimental psychologist interested in this, get in touch. I'd love to see if we can't formalize this idea.<br /><br />Anyway, a <a href="http://www.radiolab.org/blogs/radiolab-blog/2013/mar/05/heimlich/" target="_blank">recent (excellent) Radiolab episode</a> about the strange, unproven ideas of Henry Heimlich (of Heimlich maneuver fame)--along with <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2013/07/the-vitamin-myth-why-we-think-we-need-supplements/277947/?1" target="_blank">this Atlantic article</a> about Linus Pauling's ideas about vitamin mega-dosing as a cancer cure--got me thinking about the <a href="http://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Nobel_disease" target="_blank">"Nobel Disease"</a> and the effect that early successes could have on people.<br /><br />According to that link:<br /><br /><blockquote class="tr_bq">The Nobel disease is a term used to describe a phenomenon in which Nobel Prize-winning scientists endorse or perform "research" in pseudoscientific areas in their later years. In reality, this "disease" most likely demonstrates that even the most brilliant people are not immune to crank ideas and belief in such ideas will persist to some degree even among Nobelists. It also makes for a convenient argument from authority for lesser cranks, because if a Nobel Prize-winning scientist says it, it must be true!</blockquote>As we know, we humans are <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_cognitive_biases" target="_blank">susceptible to misconceptions, logical fallacies, and biases</a>.<br /><br />What if people who are <i>exceptionally</i> successful from an early age are biased into thinking that they're less fallible, at the exclusion of taking advice and/or criticism, while simultaneously their <i>incredible</i> success paralyzes other people from offering criticism?<br /><br />To put that another way, what I'm calling the "Prodigy Effect" is a two-way cognitive bias wherein one gives their own innate abilities undue positive weight with regards to their early success in a domain (business, art, science, etc.) which at the same time makes others reluctant to offer criticism. This seems like a mix of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hot-hand_fallacy" target="_blank">hot-hand fallacy</a>, some kind of "beginner's luck" bias, the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gambler's_fallacy" target="_blank">gambler's fallacy</a>, with a dose of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-serving_bias" target="_blank">self-serving bias</a> and the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spiral_of_silence" target="_blank">spiral of silence</a>.<br /><br />The hot-hand fallacy was made famous by <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=4788541579061542217&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=0,5" target="_blank">the 1985 <i>Cognitive Psychology</i> paper</a> by Gilovich, Vallone, and Tversky, "The hot hand in basketball: On the misperception of random sequences". Basically, this fallacy is one wherein someone who has had an early success at something believes they have a greater chance of success at future tasks.<br /><br />One of the first things that came to mind about this idea was <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/m-night-shymalan-movies-keep-getting-worse-2013-6" target="_blank">this chart</a> about M. Night Shyamalan's moving ratings over time. Each successive movie is essentially rated more poorly than the last:<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-Mmy6LIiFiY8/UgFH0KY1adI/AAAAAAAAFhE/UGCVXQ-8hD4/s1600/m-night-movie-popularity.jpg" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-Mmy6LIiFiY8/UgFH0KY1adI/AAAAAAAAFhE/UGCVXQ-8hD4/s1600/m-night-movie-popularity.jpg" /></a></div><br />Or this review of <i>Star Wars: The Phantom Menace </i>(jump to 4:55) about people not calling out George Lucas on some bad ideas:<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"></div><div class="p1"></div><div class="p1"><br />Both Shyamalan and Lucas had <i>crazy</i> successes with <i>The Sixth Sense</i> and <i>Star Wars: A New Hope</i>, respectively. But the subsequent movies that they directed were widely regarded as pretty awful.<br /><br />But of course, these are anecdotes, and what counts is data.<br /><br />My first idea was to take a look at the list of those who have fallen prey to the "Nobel Disease" and to look at their ages compared to the average age of other Nobelists. The hypothesis is that those who are "Nobel Diseased" would be, on average, much younger when they won their first Nobel than the average Nobelist.<br /><br />Thankfully the <a href="http://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_organizations/nobelmedia/nobelprize_org/developer/" target="_blank">Nobel Prize website has an API</a> that provides these data, which I've cleaned and organized <a href="http://darb.ketyov.com/professional/publications/nobel_disease.zip" target="_blank">here</a>. That file also includes the MATLAB script I used to analyze the data. For people with multiple Nobel prizes, I took their age at their first win.<br /><br />What I found was that those 14 people who are classified as having the "Nobel Disease" were, on average, <i>8.4 years younger </i>when they won their first Nobel Prize compared to "normal" Nobelists.<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-m7gaU2y2iFQ/UgFQpS84zII/AAAAAAAAFhU/dwCrqHCq9do/s1600/nobel_disease.jpg" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="234" src="https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-m7gaU2y2iFQ/UgFQpS84zII/AAAAAAAAFhU/dwCrqHCq9do/s320/nobel_disease.jpg" width="320" /></a></div><br />This is significant using a two-way <i>t</i>-test (<i>p</i> = 0.011) and using resampling methods (1000 surrogate group reassignments, <i>p</i> = 0.012).<br /><br />I'd love to do the same analysis on the ratings difference between a director's first film and subsequent films, with the idea that directors who have an early huge hit would then have more poorly-rated future films, but I don't have time to dig into <a href="http://developer.rottentomatoes.com/" target="_blank">the Rotten Tomatoes API</a>.<br /><br />This hypothesis could also be tested in an experimental psychology setup, though I don't quite have an idea for the experimental design yet.<br /><br />Anyway, interesting stuff regardless, I think.<br /><br />If you'd like to help, let me know!<br /><br /><div class="p1"></div><div class="p1"></div><div class="p1"></div><div class="p1"></div></div><div class="p1"></div><span style="float: left; padding: 5px;"><a href="http://www.researchblogging.org/"><img alt="ResearchBlogging.org" src="http://www.researchblogging.org/public/citation_icons/rb2_large_gray.png" style="border: 0;" /></a></span><span class="Z3988" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rft.jtitle=Cognitive+Psychology&amp;rft_id=info%3Adoi%2F10.1016%2F0010-0285%2885%2990010-6&amp;rfr_id=info%3Asid%2Fresearchblogging.org&amp;rft.atitle=The+hot+hand+in+basketball%3A+On+the+misperception+of+random+sequences&amp;rft.issn=&amp;rft.date=1985&amp;rft.volume=&amp;rft.issue=&amp;rft.spage=&amp;rft.epage=&amp;rft.artnum=&amp;rft.au=T+Gilovich%2C+R+Vallone%2C+A+Tversky&amp;rfe_dat=bpr3.included=1;bpr3.tags=Psychology%2CSocial+Science">T Gilovich, R Vallone, A Tversky (1985).

<p>What is genetic basis of our intelligence? How to stimulate deep areas of the brain? How to prevent Alzheimer’s disease?  How to slash the cost of treatment of multiple sclerosis? These are some of the questions highlighted in this monthly review of research literature. As usual, while we answer some questions, research studies also dispel some myths and assumption. Whether positive or negative,  the findings always help us to advance further our knowledge of brain and its abilities. </p>
<p>This month, we marked the birthday of Stanley Prusiner, the discoverer of prions – self-replicating proteins behind many neurodegenerative conditions such as Alzheimer’s disease and Parkinson’s disease. Recognising the importance of prions finally put the research aimed at finding the cure for these conditions on the right track.</p>
<p><strong> </strong><strong>THE BEST</strong></p>
<p><strong>New genes for intelligence identified</strong></p>
<p>Intelligence is highly heritable: it is estimated that 80% of our intelligence in adulthood is explained by genetic factors. However, our knowledge of specific genes involved in intelligence is very limited. <a href="http://www.nature.com/ng/journal/vaop/ncurrent/full/ng.3869.html">New study</a> published this month and based on the analysis of genetic data from 78,000 individuals reported 52 genes associated with <a href="http://brainblogger.com/2015/11/22/is-there-an-association-between-brain-size-and-intelligence/">intelligence</a>, 40 of which are completely novel. Interestingly, many of these genes are also involved in determining other traits such as obesity, BMI, depressive syndromes, Alzheimer’s disease and others.</p>
<p><strong>Brain region responsible for the fear of uncertain future is identified</strong></p>
<p>Many people find it difficult to cope with an uncertain future. Surprisingly, it turned out that this particular behavioural feature closely relates to the size of one specific part of the brain – the striatum. <a href="http://www.apa.org/pubs/journals/releases/emo-emo0000331.pdf">New research</a> suggests that a larger striatum is typically seen in people who have troubles dealing with uncertainties.  The study was done on psychologically healthy individuals, but an enlarged striatum has also been reported to be associated with general anxiety disorder and <a href="http://brainblogger.com/2013/07/13/multifaceted-causes-of-obsessive-compulsive-disorder/">obsessive compulsive disorder</a>.  Researchers speculate that an enlarged striatum may be linked to a higher risk of developing these disorders later in life.</p>
<p><strong>Non-invasive method of stimulating deep parts of brain</strong></p>
<p>Electric <a href="http://brainblogger.com/2015/10/29/personality-changes-after-deep-brain-stimulation/">stimulation</a> of deep parts of the brain has proven to be beneficial in treating a number of brain disorders, such as Parkinson’s disease, obsessive compulsive disorder, epilepsy, and depression. However, the approach requires implanting of an electrode directly inside the brain, which involves a risky and costly surgery. A <a href="http://www.cell.com/cell/pdf/S0092-8674(17)30584-6.pdf">new technique </a>reported this month avoids this problem by using a pair of electrodes located on the surface of the scalp. The method relies on the use of a phenomenon known as temporal interference. This techniques allows the targeted delivery of electrical stimulation to deep areas of brain, such as hippocampus, without stimulating the surface brain area.</p>
<p><strong>New cheap treatment for multiple sclerosis</strong></p>
<p>Antibiotic minocycline, traditionally used as an acne medicine, may provide a safe <a href="http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa1608889">new method </a>of treating <a href="http://brainblogger.com/2014/09/13/how-temperature-affects-people-with-multiple-sclerosis/">multiple sclerosis</a> (MS), at a fraction of current cost of treating this disease. This drug was developed over 50 years ago. It attracted the attention of researchers studying MS due to its spectrum of anti-inflammatory activities. Phase III trials demonstrated that minocycline slows the progress of disease in patients diagnosed during the early stages of MS.</p>
<p><strong>DNA-based vaccine for Alzheimer’s </strong></p>
<p>Despite our growing understanding of the molecular mechanisms behind the development of <a href="http://brainblogger.com/2017/04/17/alzheimers-disease-now-you-see-it/">Alzheimer’s disease</a>, we still have no single treatment that could cure this condition or stop its progression. An earlier attempt to develop a vaccine preventing the development of Alzheimer’s disease has also failed due to severe side effects. However, <a href="https://alzres.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13195-017-0257-7">new article</a> published this month reports a new promising DNA-based vaccine that inhibits the accumulation of amyloid proteins in animals and shows no side effects observed in previous trials. It remains to be seen if these effects can be reproduced in humans.</p>
<p><strong>Blood-brain barrier and omega-3 fatty acids</strong></p>
<p>Omega-3 fatty acids are well known for their positive effects on general health. <a href="http://www.cell.com/neuron/comments/S0896-6273(17)30287-8">Recent findings</a> demonstrate that these compounds are critical players in maintaining the integrity of the blood-brain barrier, the key structure for protecting the brain from various pathogens and toxins. Moreover, researchers demonstrated that permeability of the blood-brain barrier can be regulated by suppressing a protein that transports <a href="http://brainblogger.com/2015/11/16/nurturing-the-brain-part-7-omega-3-fatty-acids/">omega-3 acids</a> to blood vessel cells. Making the barrier more penetrable is advantageous for efficient delivery of drugs when treating patients with various brain disorders.<br />
<strong>THE WORST</strong></p>
<p><strong>No stress relief from high doses of tetrahydrocannabinol</strong></p>
<p>Users of cannabis often claim that they use the drug for relaxation and stress relief. More detailed<a href="http://www.drugandalcoholdependence.com/article/S0376-8716(17)30220-X/fulltext"> investigation</a> of this effect shows a mixed picture. While experimenting with different doses of tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), the major active substance in <a href="http://brainblogger.com/2015/05/13/debunking-the-myths-of-marijuana-withdrawal-syndrome/">marijuana</a>, researchers found that small doses of the compound do indeed reduce stress. However, a slightly higher doses (sufficient to produce a mild “high”) produce an opposite effect and increase anxiety.</p>
<p><strong>Visual cortex develops and matures much slower than assumed</strong></p>
<p>It is traditionally believed that our visual system, including the parts of brain involved in the analysis of visual information, matures within the first few years of life. A <a href="http://www.jneurosci.org/content/early/2017/05/29/JNEUROSCI.2304-16.2017">new article</a> published this month demonstrates that this assumption is incorrect. Visual cortex continues developing till the late 30s – early 40s. The authors of the article speculate that other parts of the brain may also reach maturity much later in life than currently assumed.</p>
<p><strong>Transcranial direct-current stimulation  does not enhance cognitive training</strong></p>
<p>Transcranial direct-current stimulation () is increasingly used as a method of improving learning abilities. The technique relies on passing weak electric impulses to the brain via electrodes attached to the scalp. Despite the growing popularity of this technique, the evidence in support of its advantages are very limited. A <a href="http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0956797617698139">paper</a> published this month casts further doubt on any benefits provided by <a href="http://brainblogger.com/2015/03/05/tcds-a-therapy-for-the-future/">tDCS</a>. The author reported no improvements of working memory in a large group of subjects using this method, as compared to controls. Furthermore, the analysis of the existing literature on the subject also does not provide any meaningful support to the method. Clearly, further research on tDCS should be done to confirm or rule out the existence of its effects.</p>
<p><strong>Poor sense of smell in humans is a misconception</strong></p>
<p>The superiority of animals sense of smell compared to humans appears to be obvious to most people. After all, we do rely on a dog’s sense of smell for hunting, and it is well known how quickly sharks can detect the slightest smell of blood. However, a <a href="http://science.sciencemag.org/content/356/6338/eaam7263">new article</a> published this month in <em>Science</em> attempts to dispel the view that the human ability to detect smells is as bad as we are used to thinking. The number of brain cells involved in <a href="http://brainblogger.com/2012/10/03/smell-your-age/">smell</a> detection in humans is almost the same as in animals, and it is estimated that we can distinguish up to one trillion of different odors. We may lack the degree of specialization demonstrated by many animals in interpreting the information obtained through olfactory system, but the human ability to recognize smells is definitely much stronger than we are accustomed to think.</p>
<p><strong>Women are not better than men at face recognition</strong></p>
<p>It is commonly assumed that women are better  at recognizing and reading faces and correctly interpreting facial expressions. However, a <a href="http://eneuro.org/content/early/2017/04/26/ENEURO.0104-17.2017">study</a> published this month casts serious doubts on this assumption. Using a series of tests, scientists demonstrated that no detectable difference in <a href="http://brainblogger.com/2015/10/17/how-the-brain-recognizes-faces/">facial recognition</a> exists between two genders. Importantly, the neuroimaging of the areas of brain known to be involved in face recognition has shown identical neural activity in both men and women when they were watching a video clip featuring multiple familiar and non-familiar faces.</p>

<p>Exercising self-control leaves you feeling drained. That’s what many of us in the West believe and it’s what we seem to experience – think of the fatigue after a morning spent dealing with difficult clients or focused on spreadsheets on a computer screen. But in Indian culture, there is a widespread belief that mental effort is energising – that the more concentration and self-control you expend in one situation, the more invigorated you will feel for the next challenge.</p>
<p>Psychology has, so far, mostly backed up our Western intuitions. Over 100 studies – nearly all conducted in the West – have shown that participants are less able to resist temptation or exercise mental focus after completing a mentally taxing task, an effect that researchers call “ego depletion”. But now <a href="http://psycnet.apa.org/psycinfo/2017-24735-001/">a paper in the <em>Journal of Personality and Social Psychology</em></a> has tested Indian participants and it shows for the first time a “reverse ego-depletion effect” – the more difficult an initial mental task, the better participants performed on a subsequent challenge.</p>
<p><span id="more-24854"></span></p>
<p>Belief in the benefits of exercising self-control permeates Indian Culture. Children are taught concentration techniques, such as focusing on a candle flame in a dark room. Regular prayers and meditation are widely encouraged. It’s a cultural view that appears to manifest in education: Indian children have longer class times and spend more time on homework than American children; Indian students spend more time reading books than Americans.</p>
<p>To test how these beliefs and practices might shape the basic psychological processes underlying self-control, Krishna Savani at Nanyang Technological University and Veronika Job at the University of Zurich completed four studies involving hundreds of Indian participants, as well as participants in Switzerland and the US.</p>
<p>The usual procedure was that participants completed an initial easy or difficult ten-minute challenge, such as solving mazes, the Stroop test (naming the ink colour of words denoting a different colour, e.g. “blue” written in red), word searches, or an editing type task, and then they proceeded to second, unrelated task of a similar kind. For example, the first task might be easy or difficult mazes, and the second task might be a Stroop test.</p>
<p>Indian participants who completed a more difficult initial task tended to perform better on the second challenge than Indian participants who completed an easier initial challenge – in other words, reverse ego-depletion. In most cases, Western participants showed the opposite pattern of performance, showing worse results after a tougher initial test, which is the established ego-depletion effect.</p>
<p>Among Indian participants, the more strongly they endorsed the idea that mental effort is energising, the stronger the reverse ego-depletion that they tended to exhibit.</p>
<p>These new findings challenge the established theory in Western psychology that self-control or willpower is like a fuel, that if you use it up in one situation, you will have less left over for the next challenge.</p>
<p>It’s even been suggested that self-control depends on sugar in the body and that you can enhance your willpower by consuming glucose drinks.</p>
<p>But as is so often the case in psychology these days, the story is not that simple. Recently, there have been several <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2015/06/24/new-research-challenges-the-idea-that-willpower-is-a-limited-resource/">failed attempts</a> to replicate the ego-depletion effect, even with Western participants. <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2012/11/08/labs-worldwide-report-converging-evidence-that-undermines-the-low-sugar-theory-of-depleted-willpower/">Doubts</a> have been <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2016/01/26/new-review-prompts-a-re-think-on-what-low-sugar-levels-do-to-our-thinking/">raised</a> about the links between self-control and glucose. Other <a href="http://99u.com/articles/7257/how-to-power-through-any-demanding-task">studies</a> have suggested that if people believe their willpower is unlimited, then expending self-control doesn’t harm their performance. All this points to motivation as the key factor underlying the exercise of self-control, not some energy-based physiological process.</p>
<p>These new results are in line with the motivation account. They show for the first time that if people believe mental effort is energising, not only is their performance not adversely affected by prior mental demands, but it is actually enhanced.</p>
<p>How malleable are these beliefs? In a final study, Savani and Job tested the effects of manipulating Indian and American participants’ beliefs about self-control. One group read a 600-word article about how exerting willpower is energising, the other group read an article of the same length about how exerting willpower is mentally draining. Then both groups completed two tests of mental concentration in succession.</p>
<p>Participants from India and America who read the energising text showed reverse ego-depletion: their performance on the second task was better if the first task was more challenging.  In fact the worse performance on the second task was for participants who read the “exerting willpower is energising” text and then completed an initial easy task. If you believe mental effort is energising, then it seems it is tasks that are too easy that take more of a toll.</p>
<p>The researchers said their results “can be viewed as casting further doubt on claims that ego-depletion is a pan-cultural phenomenon rooted in human biology, and instead supports the argument that motivational factors play a crucial role in determining how strenuous tasks influence subsequent self-control exertion.”</p>

<p>Results-free review is a new model of peer review aiming to reduce publication bias, preventing impressive ends justifying poor means. <a href="https://bmcpsychology.biomedcentral.com/"><em>BMC Psychology</em></a> <a href="https://bmcpsychology.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s40359-016-0167-7">launched results-free review</a> in December 2016; today the first <a href="https://bmcpsychology.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s40359-017-0183-2">article</a> to have undergone the results-free peer review process, by <a href="http://www.phpc.cam.ac.uk/people/pcu-group/researchers/zorana-zupan/">Zorana Zupan</a> and colleagues from the University of Cambridge (UK), was published. The authors also discuss their research in <a href="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/2017/06/12/are-micro-drinking-behaviors-responsible-for-increased-wine-consumption-when-served-in-a-larger-glass">this blog</a>.</p>
<p>The authors of the article and <a href="https://kclpure.kcl.ac.uk/portal/koula.asimakopoulou.html">Koula Asimakopoulou,</a> the Associate Editor who handled the peer review of the article, talk to us about their thoughts on results-free review.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>How do you think results-free review could help move towards a more robust publication process?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Authors: </strong>Results-free review is one of several measures that could improve the scientific process towards the goal of research that is more transparent, reproducible and efficient as described in the <a href="http://www.nature.com/articles/s41562-016-0021">Manifesto for Reproducible Science</a>. Results-free peer review shifts the focus of the decision to publish from the results of the research towards the importance of the research question and the adequacy of the methods used to answer it. Given that the stages of the scientific process are inter-connected, introducing measures at the evaluation stage may also positively impact other stages. For example, researchers may focus more on ensuring robust designs for their studies if these are the key point of evaluation, as in results-free peer review. Further, if findings are not central to the evaluation, this may dis-incentivize researchers from data dredging (also known as p-hacking) to produce statistically significant results to increase the chances of publication.</p>
<p><strong>Associate Editor: </strong>It is well known that studies reporting null results are less likely to receive favorable attention in terms of publication than studies reporting significant effects. The difficulty with this approach is the resultant publication bias that can take place and which, in some cases, can mask our understanding of science, to include cases where results showing that eg. Drug therapy is no better than placebo never appear. For this reason, a results-free review is likely to help a more objective peer review process to take place.<strong><br />
</strong></p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Do you have any previous experiences of publication bias?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Authors:</strong> We have experience of journals rejecting manuscripts describing studies that aimed to replicate and extend previously published studies because they are not seen as sufficiently novel.</p>
<p><strong>Associate Editor:</strong> Yes – especially with systematic reviews where there are not enough studies showing an effect to justify their publication.</p>
<blockquote><p>Well aware of the bias against null results we opted for a review process we judged could guard against this</p></blockquote>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>As far back as 1977, Michael J. Mahoney found that <a href="http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2FBF01173636">reviewers judged the methods and quality of null studies more critically than those of positive studies</a>. More recently, John P. A. Ioannidis identified a <a href="http://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/187180">substantial time lag in the publication of trials reporting null results</a>, with null results taking several months longer from the time of submission to eventual publication than positive results. Could results-free review offer a solution to current barriers of publishing null results?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Authors:</strong> Results-free review does indeed have the potential to overcome the publication bias against null results. This is a testable hypothesis.</p>
<p><strong>Associate Editor:</strong> Of course.</p>
<blockquote><p>Our experience of the review process was positive. It seemed like a more scientific approach to peer review with the paper judged on the question asked and the methods used to address the question.</p></blockquote>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>As an author, what factors influenced your decision to opt into results-free review?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Authors: </strong>Our study provided no evidence to support the hypotheses tested. Well aware of the bias against null results we opted for a review process we judged could guard against this.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Did taking part in results-free review impact the preparation or reporting of your manuscript at all?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Authors: </strong>We prepared the manuscript in the same manner as for all our publications then submitted the sections sequentially.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>What was your experience of having peer review conducted in this way? And how did it compare to standard peer review?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Authors:</strong> Our experience of the review process was positive. It seemed like a more scientific approach to peer review with the paper judged on the question asked and the methods used to address the question.</p>
<p><strong>Associate Editor:</strong> It helped me focus on the methods of the study. The difficulty that I did have was that it felt like I was missing a big part of the paper and in many respects a paper can have a great method section but totally incomprehensible / poorly analyzed results, which worried me at first. So it felt like I was reviewing half a paper rather than a complete piece of work which will take some getting used to!</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Do you think that the <a href="https://bmcpsychology.biomedcentral.com/submission-guidelines/peer-review-policy">open peer review</a> model further improves the transparency of results-free review?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Authors: </strong>Open peer reviews could help build confidence in the results-free process. Moreover, there is some evidence that open peer reviews are of higher quality than those prepared anonymously, although the potential risks of open-identity peer review should also be taken into consideration.</p>
<p><strong>Associate Editor: </strong>Most certainly. I am sure we can all think of peer reviewers who have been unkind at times, probably inadvertently. I find that an open peer review system encourages reviewers to think carefully about their recommendations.<strong><br />
</strong></p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>From the readers’ point of view, do you think that results-free review could change the appraisal of a study’s quality?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Authors:</strong> Results-free review does indeed have the potential to alter how readers approach papers, highlighting the importance of the research question and the methods used to address this as the context in which results are to be understood. If it results in more studies being published with null findings this would provide an evidence base that is more representative of a field than the one that currently exists.</p>
<p><strong>Associate Editor:</strong> I think it places greater emphasis on ensuring that when you read a Method section and an Introduction, these two tie well together and are logically related. So in that sense, yes, a results-free review may well make it harder for papers to get through a first review, unless the sections that are available to the reviewer are particularly well written.</p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>From your perspective, what are the key pros and cons of results-free review?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Author: </strong>There are many advantages of results-free review. As well as removing the bias towards publishing statistically significant findings, this process could improve the quality of systematic reviews if it fosters a less biased pool of published studies, and help in generating unbiased hypotheses. Overall this would improve the quality, reliability and credibility of scientific findings.</p>
<p>In terms of cons, the division of the peer review process into two stages may require additional work for editors and reviewers, with the potential to lengthen the peer review process, although this was not our experience. Without formal evaluation, it has the potential to appear as though it is addressing important sources of bias in the evaluation of research findings but may not actually do so and thereby inadvertently lead to false reassurance about its contribution to reproducible science.</p>
<p><strong>Associate Editor:</strong> The pro is obviously a move towards minimizing publication bias. The cons have to do with the paper feeling incomplete when you first look at it!</p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>Can you see a future for results-free review in becoming the ‘norm’ for peer review?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Author:</strong> Yes, we can see this becoming the norm. However, high-impact journals must lead in adopting these procedures.</p>
<p><strong>Associate Editor:</strong> Yes</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Results-free review offers one potential solution to tackling publication bias. However, what other key steps do you think need to be taken to address the problem?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Author:</strong> Other key areas to tackling publication bias are identified in the <a href="http://www.nature.com/articles/s41562-016-0021">Manifesto for Reproducible Science</a>. These include: pre-registering studies, data sharing and incentivizing good practice.</p>
<p><strong>Associate Editor:</strong> Dedicated outlets for studies reporting null results may be helpful.</p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>Your contribution to the future of peer review</strong><br />
The number of new publishing initiatives is on the rise and it is important that these are rigorously evaluated to ensure they are having the desired outcomes. The evaluation of results-free review, will be conducted by our randomized controlled trial, in order to determine how (an if) it influences publication bias and the editorial decision-making process. If deemed effective, it is our hope that results-free review will become the ‘norm’ for peer review.</p>
<p>In a field which has been plagued by the under-reporting of both <a href="http://bmcpsychology.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s40359-016-0135-2">replications</a> and <a href="http://bmcpsychology.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/2050-7283-1-2">null findings</a>, <em>BMC Psychology</em> has always had a policy of publishing all sound science, thus aiming to reduce the impact of publication bias. We have never made editorial decisions on the basis of the perceived interest of a study or its likely impact. We hope that results-free review is another feather in our bow in the effort to improve the reproducibility of our published research even further.</p>
<p>BioMed Central is committed to combating publication bias and promoting reproducibility. In a complementary approach to results-free review, BioMed Central is now also offering authors the chance to submit <a href="https://cos.io/rr/">Registered Reports</a>, another format shifting the emphasis from research results, to the scientific questions being asked and the strength of the study design.<em> BMC Biology</em> is the first BioMed Central journal to embrace the format and is now <a href="http://www.editorialmanager.com/bmcb/default.aspx">welcoming submissions</a>. You can learn more about the initiative by <a href="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/on-biology/2017/05/03/scientific-odyssey-pre-registering-voyage/">reading this blog</a> from the journal’s Chief Editor.</p>

<img alt="" class="attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image" height="110" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2017/06/Splash-Graham-Norris-Flickr-CC-140x110.jpg" style="display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;" width="140" /><p> </p>
<p>A <a href="http://bmcpublichealth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12889-016-3068-z">recent study</a> of ours published in <a href="https://bmcpublichealth.biomedcentral.com/"><em>BMC Public Health</em></a>, found that when the same portion of wine was served in a larger, rather than smaller, glass, wine sales increased by almost 10%. But how does a larger glass lead to increased sales or consumption? One possibility, suggested by another recent study, is that the same portion of wine in a larger, rather than smaller, glass is perceived as a smaller amount. This perceptual effect could lead to changes in drinking behavior – for example, larger glasses might encourage faster drinking, lessen satisfaction with the amount served, or increase the pleasure associated with drinking the wine. We wanted to examine these possible mechanisms.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.cochrane.org/CD011045/PUBHLTH_portion-package-or-tableware-size-changing-selection-and-consumption-food-alcohol-and-tobacco">Our recent Cochrane review</a> found that larger portion sizes and tableware increased consumption of food and non-alcoholic drinks, but found no evidence relating to consumption of alcohol. If larger glasses increase alcohol sales as suggested by <a href="http://bmcpublichealth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12889-016-3068-z">our recent study</a> increasingly large glasses could counteract policies and regulations aimed at curbing alcohol consumption. Given that alcohol is associated with an increased risk of diseases such as type 2 diabetes, cancer and liver disease, reducing the amount consumed would lead to significant health benefits.</p>

<p>In this study, <a href="https://bmcpsychology.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s40359-017-0183-2">published today</a> in <a href="http://bmcpsychology.biomedcentral.com/"><em>BMC Psychology</em></a>, we randomized female university students to drink a fixed portion of red wine (175 ml) in a larger (370 ml) or smaller (250 ml) wine glasses of the same design, in a lab-based setting. We observed their micro-drinking behavior (drinking speed, number and duration of sips) using video recordings and assessed their satisfaction and pleasure with the wine they were served using self-report measures.</p>
<p>We found no evidence that consuming wine from a larger, in comparison to a smaller glass, alters micro-drinking behavior, satisfaction or pleasure. Nonetheless, the results showed that regardless of glass size, faster drinking and greater pleasure increased the desire to drink further.</p>
<p>Further research is needed to determine whether a larger glass increases consumption by encouraging faster drinking and increasing pleasure in naturalistic settings such as bars or pubs, and with a more representative sample.</p>
<p>If clear mechanisms for how larger wine glasses may increase alcohol consumption are established, this would clarify the circumstances under which glass size may have an effect. This might inform local policies, for example, larger glass sizes served in licensed premises could be capped in order to limit alcohol consumption.</p>

<p>
 Complete and accurate reference genomes and annotations provide fundamental tools for characterization of genetic and functional variation. These resources facilitate the determination of biological processes and support translation of research findings into improved and sustainable agricultural technologies. Many reference genomes for crop plants have been generated over the past decade, but these genomes are often fragmented and missing complex repeat regions. Here we report the assembly and annotation of a reference genome of maize, a genetic and agricultural model species, using single-molecule real-time sequencing and high-resolution optical mapping. Relative to the previous reference genome, our assembly features a 52-fold increase in contig length and notable improvements in the assembly of intergenic spaces and centromeres. Characterization of the repetitive portion of the genome revealed more than 130,000 intact transposable elements, allowing us to identify transposable element lineage expansions that are unique to maize. Gene annotations were updated using 111,000 full-length transcripts obtained by single-molecule real-time sequencing. In addition, comparative optical mapping of two other inbred maize lines revealed a prevalence of deletions in regions of low gene density and maize lineage-specific genes.

Nonetheless, in terms of statistical co-occurrence in the English language, the root word <i>Islam-</i> is now associated with all that is bad and evil in the world.

The authors used a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Word_embedding" target="_blank" title="a representation of words as points in a vector space">word embedding</a> algorithm called Global Vectors for Word Representation (GloVe) to improve the performance of the machine learning model. As a measure of human bias, they used the popular <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9654756." target="_blank">implicit association test</a> (IAT), from which they developed the Word-Embedding Association Test (WEAT). Instead of response times (RTs) to a specific set of words, WEAT used the distance between a set of vectors in semantic space. The authors were able to replicate the associations seen in every IAT they tested (<a href="http://science.sciencemag.org/content/356/6334/183" target="_blank">Caliskan et al., 2017)</a>, suggesting:<br /><blockquote class="tr_bq"><span style="color: red;"><b>The  number, variety, and substantive importance of our results raise the  possibility that all implicit human biases are reflected in the  statistical properties of language. </b></span></blockquote><br /><b>Arab-Muslim Implicit Association Test</b><br /><br />Because of the relationship between word associations and implicit bias, I decided to take the <a href="https://implicit.harvard.edu/implicit/Study?tid=-1">Arab-Muslim IAT</a> at <a href="https://www.projectimplicit.net/index.html" target="_blank">Project Implicit</a>, an organization interested in “<b>implicit social cognition </b>— thoughts and feelings outside of conscious awareness and control.” This definition seemed to fit with the bus scenario, which involved an impulse to profile the driver based on a rapid evaluation of perceived ethnicity.<br /><br />In the Arab-Muslim IAT, the participant classifies words as good (e.g, <i>Fantastic</i>, <i>Fabulous</i>) or bad (e.g, <i>Horrible</i>, <i>Hurtful</i>), and proper names as Arab Muslim (e.g., <i>Akbar</i>, <i>Hakim</i>) or “Other People”  (e.g, <i>Ernesto</i>, <i>Philippe</i>, <i>Kazuki</i>).<span style="color: purple;"><b><sup>2</sup></b></span> The bias is revealed when you have to sort both of these categories at the same time.

The strength of semantic associations between words can vary over time and contexts, so we can wonder if this has shifted any in the last year. In addition, different results have been observed when <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/pmid/23175679/" target="_blank">faces were used</a> instead of names, and when a better list of “Other People” names was used to specify ingroup vs. outgroup (see explanation in footnote <b><span style="color: purple;">#2</span></b>).<br /><br />A Muslim-Terrorism test has in fact been developed by <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22435844" target="_blank">Webb et al. (2011)</a>. They used a variant of the IAT (the <a href="http://projectimplicit.net/nosek/gnat/" target="_blank">GNAT</a>) with Muslim names (e.g., <i>Abdul</i>, <i>Ali</i>, <i>Farid</i>, <i>Khalid</i>, <i>Tariq</i>), Scottish names (e.g., <i>Alistair</i>, <i>Angus</i>, <i>Douglas</i>, <i>Gordon</i>, <i>Hamish</i>), terrorism-related words (e.g., <i>attack</i>, <i>bomb</i>, <i>blast</i>, <i>explosives</i>, <i>threat</i>) and peace-related words (e.g., <i>friendship</i>, <i>harmony</i>, <i>love</i>, <i>serenity</i>, <i>unity</i>). In an interesting twist, the authors varied “implementation intentions” to flip the Muslim-Terrorism test to the Muslim-Peace test in half of the subjects:<br /><blockquote class="tr_bq">Following the practice trials, one-half of the participants (<i>implementation intention condition</i>)  were asked to form an implementation intention to help them to respond  especially quickly to Muslim names and peace-related words. Participants  were asked to tell themselves ‘If Muslim names and peace are at the top  of the screen, then I respond especially fast to Muslim words and peace  words!’. Participants were asked to repeat this statement several times  before continuing with the experiment. The other half of the  participants (<i>standard instruction condition</i>) were given no further instructions.</blockquote><br />I actually discovered this strategy on my own in 2008, when my IAT results revealed I was <a href="http://neurocritic.blogspot.com/2008/01/human-all-too-human-and-alien.html" title="Human, All Too Human (AND Alien)">Human AND Alien</a> and NEITHER <a href="http://neurocritic.blogspot.com/2008/01/im-alive-im-dead.html" title="I'm Alive I'm Dead">Dead NOR Alive</a>. <br /><br />And indeed, the Muslim-Peace instructions neutralized the strong Muslim-Terrorism association seen in the control participants <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22435844" target="_blank">Webb et al.

Even before we're born, human beings are sensitive to face-like shapes, according to a paper just published in Current Biology.



British researchers Vincent M. Reid and colleagues of the University of Lancaster used lasers to project a pattern of three red dots onto the abdomen of pregnant women. The lasers were bright enough to be visible from inside the womb. The dots were arranged to be either "face-like", i.e. with two "eyes" above one "mouth", or inverted. The inverted condition was a
