No sooner had I published my last post, on the much-discussed "women's brains are more active than men's" study, than another neuroscience paper triggered a fresh media storm. This time, the subject was videogames, and the headlines were alarming:

	Playing shooter video games damages the brain, study suggests
	Violent shooter video games really DO rot your brain
	Playing these video games could lead to brain disease

                <h4><a href="http://brainblogger.com/2017/08/14/the-evidence-for-multitasking-is-it-overrated/">Multitasking: is it Overrated?</a></h4>

<p>The ability to multitask is usually viewed positively. But does it help in improving productivity? New research indicates that this is highly unlikely.</p>
<p>For years we have been hearing and being allured by the term multitasking, with many of us unwittingly believing that it is something supernatural and too good to neglect, and we ought to develop it in ourselves to succeed. But the question arises, is it as good as it sounds? What does the new research say? Is it possible for a person to concentrate and remain productive on several tasks at once?</p>
<p>Going through research articles can be perplexing for most of us, but most of the research seems to favor doing one task at a time. There are several downsides to multitasking, often resulting in decreased overall productivity and quality of work. A person who tries to finish one job at a time seems to do more at the end of the day. Multitasking could be valuable only to a certain extent if you are doing some simple tasks, but after a certain threshold productivity decreases and quality of work suffers. Multitasking often fails to improve productivity.</p>
<p>Ultimately, it depends on the kind of tasks you are doing. If a person is doing lots of jobs, that are simple and the person performing them is adept at them, then maybe yes, in some cases multitasking may be good, but mostly this is not the case. Some people are inherently inferior to others in multitasking. One thing that most scientific research demonstrates is that multitasking results in significant loss of accuracy. The more you multitask, the more errors you are bound to make, thereby leading to reduced overall productivity. Considering that in some cases performance errors can even be catastrophic, improved performance with most multitasking is a mere illusion that comes at the price of poor results and higher error rate.</p>
<h3>Multitasking leads to mental overloading</h3>
<p>When people are given various tasks, they need some time to switch to another function. This results in the loss of both time and productivity. This switching time is directly related to the complexity of the task. If the task is being switched to is complicated and less familiar, one needs more time then when attending to more familiar task. Thus multitasking can result in mental overloading in reconfiguring mental settings as one switches between tasks. Also one has to memorize more information while switching between the various functions, like the progress status of the previous task. Research shows that these short mental blocks between the switching can bring down productivity by as much as forty percent. Scheduling tasks can be more efficient in increasing productivity as compared with multitasking.</p>
<h3>What about gender differences?</h3>
<p>Women may be better at juggling between several tasks, but this is true only when the tasks are simple in nature, the kind of tasks achieved on a daily basis, that do not require much mental processing. Examples include cleaning the house and talking on the phone. But when multitasking involves more complex tasks, this gender difference becomes irrelevant. Therefore,  talking on the phone while driving is equally dangerous for both sexes. In fact, one study demonstrated that women dislike multitasking as much as the men do. Given a choice, women don’t seem to switch between several tasks more often than men. When multitasking, both genders perform equally poorly. Whether multitasking is done by free will or it has been forced due to job constraints does not seem to have any effect on productivity.</p>
<h3>Who is multitasking and why?</h3>
<p>One study focused on finding personality differences between self-proclaimed multitaskers and non-multitaskers. The study tried to find out why some people opt to multitask while other may avoid, and if the multitaskers are actually any good at multitasking. Results of the research were quite astonishing.</p>
<p>Most of the people who multitask are not necessarily good at it. In fact, the results pointed to the opposite: people who are good at multitasking usually avoid doing it. Generally, those who are impulsive sensation seekers tend to multitask. By multitasking, some of these people seem to gain pleasure. Another reason why certain people multitask is due to overbloated self-assessment. Individuals who more regularly multitask often overrate their capabilities and fail to understand that they are not better than others in multitasking.</p>
<p>Multitaskers make mistakes more often, and they seem to be less self-critical about their abilities, and they have lowered understanding of their errors and losses. Further, multitaskers are often people with attention deficits who have difficulty focusing on a single given task.</p>
<h3>What we know so far about multitasking</h3>
<ul>
<li>Multitasking decreases productivity in most cases, by as much as forty percent.</li>
<li>Multitasking results in much higher error rates, which reduces productivity and can be harmful in some cases.</li>
<li>There are no proven gender differences in efficient multitasking.</li>
<li>Multitasking is often related to certain personality traits like being impulsive and sensation seeking.</li>
<li>Multitaskers are not typically the people who are good at it.</li>
<li>Multitaskers often lack the ability to concentrate properly on a given task.</li>
<li>Effectiveness of multitasking depends on the complexity of the job, with multiple complex jobs being harder to do at the same time than multiple easy jobs.</li>
<li>Scheduling the various tasks can increase productivity relative to multitasking.</li>
</ul>
<p>Thus,  the existing research studies seem to favor doing tasks sequentially or one by one, rather than multitasking. Multitasking increases the risk of making mistakes, and this rule applies equally to both genders. Therefore, understanding the downsides of multitasking not only improves productivity, but might also save us from catastrophic errors.</p>

<p>Your body’s immune system normally fights illness or injury, but when it’s overactive over a prolonged period of time, the consequences can be harmful. “Chronic systemic inflammation” (marked by raised levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines through the body) has been <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4579563/">linked to a wide range of physical and mental health problems</a>, including heart disease, diabetes and depression. One cause is a poor lifestyle, involving little exercise and an unhealthy diet. Anthony Ong, at Cornell University, US, and his team were interested in whether our emotional lives might play a role too. Their <a href="http://psycnet.apa.org/record/2017-27036-001">new research</a>, published in the journal <i>Emotion</i>, found that people with lower systemic inflammation didn’t simply report more happiness, rather they experienced a greater variety of positive emotions every day.</p>
<p><span id="more-28589"></span></p>
<p>“There’s growing evidence that inflammatory processes may help to explain how emotions get ‘under the skin,” the researchers write in their paper. They point to evidence suggesting that negative emotions, such as fear and shame, can stimulate inflammatory responses. And also to work finding that positive emotions are associated with lower levels of C-reactive protein and IL-6 (two classic markers of inflammation). “Taken together, experiences of negative and positive emotion in both trait and state form appear to influence the adaptive regulation of core biological systems that maintain health,” they write.</p>
<p>The team analysed previously-collected data on 175 healthy people aged 45-60 living in Phoenix, Arizona. These volunteers had their levels of three inflammatory markers (IL-6, CRP and fibrinogen) measured at the start of the study, and at a six-month follow-up. They were also taught how to use a tablet computer to provide questionnaire-led diary entries each night for 30 days.</p>
<p>The questions included a measure of daily emotional experiences: the volunteers were asked to rate the extent to which they’d experienced 16 positive emotions (including feeling enthusiastic, determined or amused), and 16 negative emotions (including feeling afraid, distressed, jittery, anxious or ashamed) during that day.</p>
<p>When the team analysed the data, they found that greater positive “emodiversity” – regularly experiencing a broad range of positive emotions – was associated with lower levels of inflammation (this was after they’d controlled statistically for any influences of age, gender, medications, BMI, medical conditions and personality). There was, however, no significant relationship between negative emodiversity and inflammation. “These findings highlight the unique role daily positive emotions play in biological health,” the researchers conclude.</p>
<p>There were limitations with the study. Volunteers were asked to remember at night all the different emotions they’d experienced in the course of the day. Since chronic inflammation is also associated with poorer memory, it’s possible that people with elevated inflammation just couldn’t remember all their emotional experiences. Studies using a more intensive emotion sampling approach could provide more useful results.</p>
<p>It’s also impossible, from this study, to answer the question: how could experiencing a diverse spectrum of positive emotions influence inflammation? It’s possible that being more in tune with exactly how you’re feeling could lead to more adaptive health behaviours, the researchers suggest.</p>
<p>But as they also concede, “the directionality of the observed associations cannot be determined.” It might be that a lack of diversity in emotion results from heightened levels of inflammation, rather than causes them. Certainly, when it comes to depression, for example, while raised levels of inflammatory markers are associated with depression, whether that’s a result or a cause is debated. Clearly, there’s a need for good longitudinal studies to clarify these relationships.</p>

<p><strong>Dining out </strong></p>
<p>Preparing a child for eating out at a dine–in restaurant may present a challenge for some families. Children can be picky and fickle with their preferences; smell, color and even shape of food may drive a child to an extreme opinion, forever prejudicing them against an otherwise inoffensive foodstuff.</p>
<p>Finding a restaurant that their child is excited to visit is no small victory for caregivers. Though, for caregivers of children with food hypersensitivities, eating out with the family can prove to be more complex. Restaurants serving foods prepared with peanuts, tree nuts, eggs, milk, cereals containing gluten and crustaceans require careful approach. Or, frequently in cases where compromise appears improbable, total avoidance.</p>
<p>Food hypersensitivity is a generic descriptor, used for anyone who suffers reproducible and objective symptoms that occur after the ingestion of a particular food. Total avoidance is a common strategy for families of food hypersensitive children; both food items and the restaurants serving them can be abstained from to remove the chance of endangering a food hypersensitive child.</p>
<p>Given that eating out is attributed with 50% of deaths related to food allergen consumption, constant vigilance is required. Living with food hypersensitivity is an ongoing day-to-day challenge that can be described as “living with risk” for both the families and children with food hypersensitivities.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Additional pressures</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>stick to the same place if you’ve been there once and its ok, and if he doesn’t have a reaction…if he likes it, it’s a bonus</p></blockquote>
<p>Anxiety for many caregivers can stem from an anticipated lack of competence or understanding on the part of restaurants, school cafeterias or other outside food venues. Worries can worsen when caregivers are not present to ensure their child’s safety. Accidental cross contamination of triggering foodstuffs may place a child at risk.</p>
<p>However, in some worrying cases, children may be directly served the food item that they have a hypersensitivity to even after being told the nature of the child’s allergy. One caregiver stated so much when they shared that “[At] the start (nursery) struggled….They have had a couple of slip ups like the (ready mix dessert) and a couple of times because the teacher will go on holiday… I feel quite let down sometimes because I stress to them when I go in.”</p>
<p>To avoid potential issues, monotony in dining can quickly become the norm, with a focus on safety over enjoyment. One parent explained that they would “…tend to stick to the same place if you’ve been there once and its ok, and if he doesn’t have a reaction…if he likes it, it’s a bonus.”  However, the authors describe the necessity for creating a balance between caution with variety; safety with social freedom; and preferences of the food hypersensitive child with preferences of their siblings.</p>
<blockquote><p>I feel quite let down sometimes because I stress to them when I go in</p></blockquote>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Alleviating stressors </strong></p>
<p>The transfer of responsibility from caregiver to child during adolescent development may alleviate some of the anxiety experienced by caregivers; through the incorporation of a number of strategies to support self-management and autonomy in their children, caregivers may feel relief knowing that their child has the tools to navigate the world safely when outside of their homes.</p>
<p>By encouraging their children to clearly state their hypersensitivity and consequent dietary needs many children effectively avoid their allergen without the need of their caregiver’s direct supervision.</p>
<p>Giving food hypersensitive children the tools to operate without the immediate support of their caregivers is an important step towards providing them with a level of personal responsibility, while also relieving caregiver anxieties. However, a need exists for food proprietors to further their support and understanding of the tools and strategies to ensure positive eating out experiences for children with food hypersensitivity.</p>
<p>Ultimately, Fiona M Begen et al. suggest that there is a potential to reduce the day-to-day anxieties of caregivers and to provide them and their children with improved quality of life.</p>

<img alt="" class="attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image" height="110" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2017/08/12862_2017_1014_Fig5_HTML-140x110.gif" style="display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;" width="140" /><p>In the last decade, automatic plant identification has become a key interdisciplinary research field that supports botanists in their efforts to identify and classify <i>all</i> plants on earth. Computer vision applied to plant images has been proven to be helpful for this task. It started with low accuracy results under extremely controlled environments but has quickly evolved to better and more accurate algorithms. Consequently we have useful tools such as <a href="https://identify.plantnet-project.org/">Pl@ntNet</a> that allow common citizens to identify species of plants with images taken in-the-wild.</p>
<p>The number of institutions that maintain herbaria around the world is around 3,000; with more than 350,000,000 specimens stored under controlled environments. This reflects the accumulated conservation efforts of thousands of botanists around the globe since centuries ago. If we couple both the herbarium sheet images and computer vision techniques, in particular deep learning, herbaria around the world would have more arguments to demonstrate the value and impact of maintaining and investing in these precious collections, as providers of a completely new dataset, most likely useful in the automatic plant identification domain.</p>
<p>A new study by researchers from <a href="https://www.tec.ac.cr/">Costa Rica Institute of Technology</a>, <a href="http://amap.cirad.fr/en/">CIRAD</a> and <a href="https://team.inria.fr/zenith">INRIA</a> does exactly this: it tackles the problem of automatic plant identification using deep learning techniques coupled with herbarium sheet images.</p>
<figure class="wp-caption alignleft" id="attachment_9405" style="width: 2458px;"><img alt="" class="wp-image-9405 size-full" height="3264" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2017/08/Bonnet-1.jpg" title="Pierre Bonnet" width="2448" /><div class="attachment-image--caption">Herbarium specimens presentation, at the Botanical Research Institute of Texas (BRIT), Fort Worth, Texas</div><div class="attachment-image--source"></div></figure>
<p><b>Automatic Plant Identification</b></p>
<p>Initial automatic plant identification was focused on leaf images for easier algorithm development and material preparation, evolving later to images of plants in-the-wild, with additional organs such as flowers, fruits, and others, and complex environments captured in the field. Thanks to the <a href="http://www.imageclef.org/lifeclef/2017/plant">PlantCLEF</a> evaluation campaign, algorithms have evolved to better accuracy and are now able to deal with high levels of noise in the images, as well as more images and species. A couple of years ago, the Pl@ntNET initiative involving several French research institutions (INRIA, CIRAD, INRA and IRD) started using deep learning technology for its mobile plant identification.</p>
<p><b>Deep Learning Technology</b></p>
<p>During the ImageNet computer vision competition, in 2012, Alex Krizhevsky beat the previous state-of-the-art generalistic identification systems by a considerable margin by using a Convolution Neural Network for the first time. Since then, deep learning has become the facto technology for artificial intelligence (AI) and computer vision in the computer science community. This technology allows predictive models to “learn” concepts based on simpler concepts, in a sense similarly to the visual cortex of humans.</p>
<p>Deep Learning is not really a new technology. However, its full potential has been within reach in the last years thanks to two main factors, namely, the increased processing power of Graphical Processing Units (GPUs) and the availability of vasts amounts data. Models tend to require more data in order to be able to generalize better on unseen examples. This is where herbarium sheets become relevant, as their digitization can be useful to increase a global plant dataset for plant identification in the deep learning scene.</p>
<p><b>Scaling up a global visual plant dataset</b></p>
<p>As part of the need to apply deep learning on plant identification, there is a need for a global dataset with, hopefully, all known plant species, which is estimated to be around 400,000 species globally. As herbaria has hundreds of millions of specimens stored in their cabinets, it is logical to attempt to make use of those sheets as images in order to improve the global dataset in question. This global dataset improvement is in terms of size and also in terms of how balanced the dataset should be (machine learning algorithms tend to learn better when the number of images per class is roughly the same). Thanks to efforts such as <a href="https://www.idigbio.org/">iDigBio</a>, which invest a lot in delivering and aggregating digital images, we now have millions of digital records of specimens publicly available that can be used to build such a global dataset. Encyclopedia of Life, GBIF, iNaturalist, and Pl@ntNet, among others, have also generated and published large amounts of plant images.</p>
<p>One of the problems with herbarium images is visual noise. Normally, specimens are placed on sheets without automated visual processing needs in mind. For instance, organs are juxtaposed and elements such as labels are also present in the image. Deep learning is a technology that has been proven to deal particularly well with visual noise and complex images. So now it is the right time to attempt to use it with herbaria images.</p>
<figure class="wp-caption alignleft" id="attachment_9406" style="width: 3274px;"><img alt="" class="size-full wp-image-9406" height="2448" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2017/08/Bonnet-2.jpg" width="3264" /><div class="attachment-image--caption">Room dedicated to specimen preparation, at the Botanical Research Institute of Texas (BRIT), Fort Worth, Texas</div><div class="attachment-image--source">Pierre Bonnet</div></figure>
<p><b>Supporting Herbarium Institutions with Deep Learning</b></p>
<p>The study of Carranza-Rojas et al proves that using deep learning with herbarium images renders good accuracy results on species identification that use herbarium images for both training and testing in an identification system. This could result in a future identification system for herbaria to support botanists conduct  their work with the huge volume of visual data now available. The authors also prove that using herbarium images from one region of the world to train such models, can result in knowledge transferable to other regions of the world. This is one of the first “transfer learning” experiments in the botanical context. This could be particularly useful for herbarium institutions that still don’t have a large amount of digitalized images. Because some of the richest biodiversity regions of the world are the least prospected, this transfer learning approach can be very important to improve the use of datasets on these floras.</p>
<p>As a result of  this study, herbarium institutions may gain additional value. There is a  huge amount of work invested by field explorers, botanists, taxonomists, technicians, and data managers that has generated very useful data not only for the biological sciences but also for the computer science community. We hope that this work will open the door to stronger collaborations between these communities, particularly between Natural History Museums and Machine Learning / Computer Vision labs.</p>

<p>Fussy eating – also referred to as “selective eating” in scholarly research – is incredibly common among children, with upper estimates placing the prevalence at 50 per cent. Despite this, many parents understandably fret when their kids avoid a lot of foods, won’t try new things and/or will only eat certain meals. They worry whether their child is getting enough vitamins and if their child’s fussiness is some kind of precursor to later more serious eating problems.</p>
<p>A new, <a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1471015316302677?_rdoc=1&amp;_fmt=high&amp;_origin=gateway&amp;_docanchor=&amp;md5=b8429449ccfc9c30159a5f9aeaa92ffb&amp;dgcid=raven_sd_via_email">small study</a> in <em>Eating Behaviors</em> is the first to document how fussy eating develops in the same individuals over time into early adulthood and may provide a crumb (sorry) of comfort for anxious parents. It’s true that 60 per cent of fussy eating children in the study were also fussy eaters at age 23, but fussy eating young adults were no more likely to report signs of eating disorder than their non-fussy peers.</p>
<p><span id="more-28508"></span></p>
<p>The researchers led by Meredith Van Tine at Stanford University School of Medicine managed to catch up with 61 individuals, now aged 23, who’d participated as children in a long-running study in which their eating habits had been scored by their parents at ages 2, 7, 9.5 and 11, including any signs of fussy eating (being a “selective eater”, having strong likes and dislikes, and only eating a limited variety of foods etc). The participants were now asked to rate themselves on whether they were selective or fussy eaters, and they answered questions about whether they engaged in behaviours related to eating disorders.</p>
<p>Just over half the sample had been rated as fussy eaters at some point. Developmentally, the pattern was for fussy eating to increase in prevalence through early childhood, peak at age 6, then decline through middle childhood (when rated at ages 7 and 9). In terms of continuity from childhood to adulthood, six of the ten participants who’d been scored as fussy eaters at age 3 also rated themselves as fussy eaters now they were young adults.</p>
<p>Duration of fussy eating as a child was also associated with likelihood of being a fussy eater as an adult; in fact, all the participants who’d been a fussy eater for more than six years as a child also described themselves as a fussy eater as an adult.</p>
<p>Some of the participants had acquired fussy eating habits in adolescence or later. Among the 17 participants now describing themselves as fussy eaters, 6 had shown no signs as children (so they must have acquired the behaviour at some point between age 11 and 23).</p>
<p>Perhaps most important, as 23-year-olds, there was no evidence that the fussy eaters in the group were any more likely to engage in behaviours, like purging or bingeing, that are typically associated with eating disorders, nor did they show signs of being underweight, overweight or obesity. This tallies with <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25747855">a recent larger survey</a> of hundreds of adult “picky eaters” who were found to be at no greater risk of eating disorder-related behaviours than non picky eaters.</p>
<p>The new research involved a small sample and the mix of early parent reports and later self-reports wasn’t ideal, but on the plus side it’s the first ever research to chart fussy eating in the same people from childhood to adulthood.</p>

<p>
 Mammalian genomes contain thousands of loci that transcribe long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs), some of which are known to carry out critical roles in diverse cellular processes through a variety of mechanisms. Although some lncRNA loci encode RNAs that act non-locally (in trans), there is emerging evidence that many lncRNA loci act locally (in cis) to regulate the expression of nearby genes—for example, through functions of the lncRNA promoter, transcription, or transcript itself. Despite their potentially important roles, it remains challenging to identify functional lncRNA loci and distinguish among these and other mechanisms. Here, to address these challenges, we developed a genome-scale CRISPR–Cas9 activation screen that targets more than 10,000 lncRNA transcriptional start sites to identify noncoding loci that influence a phenotype of interest. We found 11 lncRNA loci that, upon recruitment of an activator, mediate resistance to BRAF inhibitors in human melanoma cells. Most candidate loci appear to regulate nearby genes. Detailed analysis of one candidate, termed EMICERI, revealed that its transcriptional activation resulted in dosage-dependent activation of four neighbouring protein-coding genes, one of which confers the resistance phenotype. Our screening and characterization approach provides a CRISPR toolkit with which to systematically discover the functions of noncoding loci and elucidate their diverse roles in gene regulation and cellular function.

<p>We've gotten the <a class="reference external" href="https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Classroom">Fedora classroom</a> sessions going again. After two really good ones, I taught the <a class="reference external" href="https://fedoramagazine.org/fedora-classroom-session-3/">third one</a> today - a beginners session to the command line. Unlike the previous ones that used video platforms, I decided that the <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Relay_Chat">IRC</a> was best suited to this session, even more so because I wanted it to be a hands-on session. It went off pretty well. Here are a few notes. Links to the logs are at the bottom of this post.</p>
<div class="section" id="some-metrics">
<h2>Some metrics</h2>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Length: 2 hours (was planned to be an hour, but we quickly realised that it wouldn't be enough!)</li>
<li>Attendees: 29 - a few of us had FAS usernames too (so we shared cookies!)</li>
<li>About 800 sentences were spoken (I spoke about half of these, of course)</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="summary">
<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>I quite enjoyed it, but then I enjoy tinkering with the command line anyway. A few folks stuck around for the full two hours, so that does indicate that they found the session somewhat useful. I'd put up a <a class="reference external" href="https://gist.github.com/sanjayankur31/f40070c6925e8885394d2dd750ae4cb8">gist here with a tentative agenda</a>. We didn't manage to go more than half way through it, though. We:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>did a quick introduction to what a shell is</li>
<li>learned how to get help using local information - using the man pages</li>
<li>quickly saw the difference between absolute and relative paths, and also learned about <code>..</code> and <code>.</code></li>
<li>went on to look at some more basic commands/built-ins and their switches/flags/options: <code>ls, apropos, clear, cd, pwd, which, alias, rm, tree, mkdir, wget, rmdir, rm, fpaste, wc, head, tail, more, less, cat, tac, grep, sort, uniq</code></li>
<li>used these commands to download a copy of <a class="reference external" href="http://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/1120/pg1120.txt">"The tragedy of Julius Caesar" from Project Gutenberg</a>, and then extracted some information from it. For example, we obtained how many times Caesar was mentioned in the text. For a more advanced task we also obtained how many times Caesar, Brutus, Cassius, and Casca were each mentioned using a single set of commands. This required the use of <code>grep, sort, uniq, wc</code> in different combinations using input-output redirection (pipes in this case). At no point did we use a text editor, and we stuck to using local man pages.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="takeaways">
<h2>Takeaways</h2>
<p>I hope that this rather quick session gave the participants some idea of how the shell can be used for lots of tasks. I also hoped to show them that there's a lot of information available on the system itself that a user can refer to.</p>
<p>I learned a few things myself. I learned that an hour is too short for a proper online session, for example. My supposition that demonstrating commands using tasks would make the session more appealing seems to have been correct too. Only, maybe next time I'll pick a more contemporary text?</p>
<p>For the next session, I'll try and cover slightly more advanced topics, such as tests, loops, maybe even a bit of awk. We shall see.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="feedback-is-always-welcome">
<h2>Feedback is always welcome</h2>
<p>If you had attended the session, or have gone through the logs and have some feedback, please get in touch. You can use the Fedora classroom channels:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><a class="reference external" href="mailto:classroom@lists.fedoraproject.org">mailing list</a></li>
<li>#fedora-classroom on Freenode <a class="reference external" href="http://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=%23fedora-classroom">IRC channel</a></li>
</ul>
<p>You can even comment on this blog post, and of course, you can give me feedback privately. I'm also looking to make a list of tasks that I can use in future sessions - tasks that would be useful, fun, and that would also require some command line tricks - such that they would demonstrate the power of the command line. So, if you have your pet command line tricks/aliases, please do get in touch.</p>
<p>I'm FranciscoD on quite a few Fedora IRC channels, and I can be reached via e-mail on my Fedora address at ankursinha AT fedoraproject DOT org. All suggestions, comments, criticism is most welcome.</p>

<p>While the idea that the lack of women in science and tech is <em>entirely</em> about cultural obstacles is contentious (as <a href="http://quillette.com/2017/08/07/google-memo-four-scientists-respond/">demonstrated</a> <a href="https://www.theglobeandmail.com/opinion/no-the-google-manifesto-isnt-sexist-or-anti-diversity-its-science/article35903359/">by</a> the recent Google memo furore), few would argue that social and cultural factors aren’t important. And these social influences may begin early. For example there’s an argument that boys are encouraged to play with toys that are likely to promote skills that will help them in science and maths. Toys aimed at girls, in contrast, are more likely to promote stereotypically feminine skills, such as nurturing.</p>
<p>LEGO, say Megan Fulcher and Amy Hayes, the authors of a <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11199-017-0806-3">new paper</a> in the journal <em>Sex Roles</em>, is a case in point: its marketing is skewed towards boys, especially since the increase in packaged sets, which tend to feature stereotypically masculine items like pirate ships and castles. The result, they argue, is that boys are more attracted to LEGO, girls deterred from it, and that boys get to practice their building skills while girls don’t.</p>
<p>LEGO has heard some of this criticism (and no doubt also seen a gap in the market) and they’ve released girl-friendly packaged sets and product lines, including <em>Friends</em> items with a focus on people and including pink bricks. But Fulcher and Hayes – who very much speak from the nurture perspective on these issues (they fail to cite a single study demonstrating a biological basis for sex differences in toy preference) – fear this could be counterproductive because girlie bricks and sets are likely to promote more stereotypically feminine LEGO play and remind girls of their gender. To find out if their concerns are justified the researchers tested the LEGO building skills and choices of 116 girls and boys (aged 5 to 10) depending on whether they were given boyish LEGO bricks and packages or girlie ones.</p>
<p><span id="more-28339"></span></p>
<p>For the first phase of the study, the boys and girls were randomly assigned to follow instructions to build either a stereotypically male design (a dinosaur) or a female design (a cat). Also, whatever object they were trying to build, half were given boyish bricks to use (blue/green), and half were given girlie bricks (pink purple).</p>
<p>Fulcher and Hayes predicted that girls would be slower and less accurate to build the LEGO when they were tasked with building the cat and/or when they were using girlie bricks (because these items would activate “typically gendered play scripts” and remind the girls that “there is a different kind of LEGO for you”).</p>
<p>In fact, this wasn’t the case: the girls’ (and boys’) speed and accuracy was just the same regardless of what type of bricks they used. And girls and boys alike more quickly and accurately built the cat than the dinosaur, presumably because it was easier. However, whatever they were building, overall the boys were quicker at construction than the girls (with no accuracy tradeoff) and this remained the case even after factoring out experience with and interest in LEGO.</p>
<p>The second phase of the study involved free play. Half the girls and half the boys were given girlie bricks (pink and white) to play with and build whatever they wanted, the other half were given boyish bricks (blue and grey). Each set also included wheels (supposedly boyish) and eyes (supposedly girlie). The children could take as long as they wanted and when they’d finished they were asked to say what they’d built.</p>
<p>Overall, the boys built more stereotypically masculine objects than girls, such as water monsters and machine guns, they also incorporated wheels more into their designs than did the girls. This was as the researchers predicted since they believe that boys are not affected by any relevant cultural stereotypes or expectations that might be triggered by the different bricks. However, the researchers predicted that girls given pink bricks would be reminded of their gender and so build more girlie objects with these bricks, and that’s what happened.</p>
<p>Fulcher and Hayes believe this shows that while “more girl-targeted and ‘girl’-colour LEGO sets” may help attract more girls to play with LEGO, they do so at the cost of “restricting the kinds of structures and play with which they engage”. However, remembering the null effects in the first study phase, it seems they found only limited evidence to back up their concerns. And these are concerns which currently depend on a good deal of speculation – for instance, the new study doesn’t provide any direct evidence that it is at all harmful that girls are more likely to build stereotypically feminine objects with pink bricks. It also seemed an omission not to measure the boys’ and girls’ enjoyment. If girls prefer playing with girl-targeted LEGO more than other kinds, isn’t that also an important part of the equation?</p>

<img alt="" class="attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image" height="110" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2017/08/Giehr-Figure2-140x110.jpg" style="display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;" width="140" /><p>Sociality favours the adjustment to ecological niches and facilitates the spread of a species. Group living is therefore widespread, from insects to mammals, but differs in the degree of cooperation and altruism. In subsocial species (e.g. giant water bugs, several spiders or fish), the parents stay with their offspring for some time until the latter start to reproduce independently. In cooperatively breeding birds (e.g. Southern Ground-Hornbill) or mammals (e.g. mongooses), sociality reaches a higher level with older siblings or other group members helping to raise offspring.</p>
<p>The highest form of social cooperation is eusociality, which is rare in mammals (only naked-mole rats), but abundant in two insect orders: Hymenoptera (e.g. bees, wasps, ants) and Blattodea (termites). The intense cooperation between individuals in these species might be the cause of the evolutionary and ecological success of eusocial insects, which can make up to 75% of a habitat’s animal biomass.</p>
<h3><strong>The organisation of eusocial insect colonies</strong></h3>
<p>In general, colonies of eusocial Hymenoptera consist of overlapping generations of related, female individuals, whereas males are often only produced seasonally for mating. Most females, the “workers”, refrain from reproduction or are completely sterile. They care for other colony members and the brood, supply them with food, and maintain or defend the nest. In many species these tasks are distributed by age: the younger workers conduct work within the nest, while the older ones take over the risky tasks outside the nest. The reproductive queens do not participate in such non-reproductive tasks but are responsible for the production of new offspring. They often differ from the workers in body size and morphology.</p>
<figure class="wp-caption alignleft" id="attachment_9393" style="width: 4618px;"><img alt="" class="size-full wp-image-9393" height="3052" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2017/08/Giehr-Figure1.jpg" width="4608" /><div class="attachment-image--caption">A winged virgin queen and a wingless mated queen of the ant <em>Cardiocondyla obscurior</em></div><div class="attachment-image--source">Julia Giehr</div></figure>
<p>The fitness of insect societies mainly depends on the efficiency of interactions between reproductives and helpers, as the reproductive task is not exchangeable in many species. This makes ants a suitable model organism to study the interrelations between individual and group characteristics.</p>
<p>Unpredictable social or environmental changes, like, e.g., destruction of the nest, might afford adaptions regarding the task allocations. Ants of our study species <em>Cardiocondyla obscurior</em> found new nests via budding, which means that a few individuals – e.g. workers, together with brood and queen(s) – leave the maternal nest to initiate a new colony. In this case, workers might have to react flexibly to new conditions and possibly have to switch from outer to inner nest tasks and vice versa. Although studies in bees and ants have confirmed a flexible task allocation, its effect on the performance and survival of individuals has rarely been studied. In our study we wanted to test whether a forced task shift has an effect on colony growth and fitness.</p>
<h3><strong>Our experimental set-up</strong></h3>
<p>In our study, we created new colonies that consisted of only young (freshly eclosed) or only old (12 weeks old) workers, together with either a single young or old queen. This setup forced a part of the young workers to leave the nest precociously to forage, while several old workers had to revert from foraging to brood care.</p>
<p>We then examined the effect of queen and worker age on colony growth and task performance by estimating the number of produced brood and offspring and its quality (weight) during a complete colony lifecycle.</p>
<figure class="wp-caption alignleft" id="attachment_9395" style="width: 4618px;"><img alt="" class="size-full wp-image-9395" height="3052" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2017/08/Giehr-Figure3.jpg" width="4608" /><div class="attachment-image--caption">Mated <em>Cardiocondyla obscurior</em> queen (left) together with brood items and one worker (right)</div><div class="attachment-image--source">Julia Giehr</div></figure>
<p>Our experiment showed that colonies perform much better when queens and workers are of similar age. Task performance of a worker did not mainly depend on its chronological age but on group composition.</p>
<p>Surprisingly, lifespan appears to be a very plastic trait in ants and is strongly affected by colony demography. The event of colony founding seems to reset the age of the workers and indicates that chronological and physiological age are not necessarily linked. Twelve-week old workers that were exposed to the condition of a newly founded nest with a new queen and without brood outlived workers that eclosed in the same situation by several weeks. A similar effect of social environment was also observed in queens.</p>
<h3><strong>Why observe ageing in ants?</strong></h3>
<p>Aging and senescence are ubiquitous phenomena throughout multicellular life and have fascinated humanity for centuries. Although many studies have focussed on the mechanisms underlying aging, its proximate and ultimate causes are still not completely understood.</p>
<p>The ant <em>Cardiocondyla obscurior</em> provides an ideal model organism for ageing in social insects<em>. </em>It appears that the lifespan of workers is more affected by colony stage and demography than by chronological age and that workers do not suffer strongly from an age-related decline of performance.</p>
<p>Furthermore, queens of this species not only outlive their conspecific sterile nestmates (workers) by weeks, despite sharing the same genome, but in contrast to other animals they also do not suffer from reduced survival after an increased investment in reproduction.</p>
<p>Negative senescence and the effects on physiological age still raise many questions. This is why our team at the University of Regensburg, together with colleagues in a DFG-funded research unit (“Sociality and the reversal of the fecundity-longevity trade-off,” FOR 2281), focuses on reproduction and ageing in social insect queens.</p>

<p>To understand the drivers of a psychopathic personality (marked by callousness, disinhibition and superficial charm), it’s worth looking at our closest relatives. Some chimps, like some people, score highly on scales designed to evaluate psychopathic tendencies. And <a href="http://journal.frontiersin.org/article/10.3389/fnins.2017.00407/full">new work</a> in <i>Frontiers in Neuroscience </i>reveals a potentially important genetic contributor to psychopathic traits<b> </b>in chimps, which could lead to a better understanding of the traits in people.</p>
<p><span id="more-28322"></span></p>
<p>The team led by Robert Latzman at Georgia State University studied 164 chimpanzees housed at the Yerkes National Primate Research Center in Atlanta, Georgia and the National Center for Chimpanzee Care at the University of Texas. Each chimpanzee was rated by typically two to three colony staff members, who knew the individual animals, on the “CHMP-Tri scales” (a kind of chimp personality questionnaire that assesses their boldness, meanness and disinhibition – the three traits that form the so-called “<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19583890">triarchic model” of psychopathy</a>). They also sequenced the AVPR1A regions of the chimps’ genomes.</p>
<p>Latzman and his team decided to home in on this gene because it codes for a receptor for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vasopressin">vasopressin</a>, a neuropeptide known to play a role in complex social behaviours in humans and other animals, and so, in theory, relates to psychopathy. Vasopressin levels have been found to correlate with a history of aggression in people with various personality disorders. And polymorphisms (variations) in a region of the AVPR1A gene have been associated with <a href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jopy.12119/full">variability in a number of traits relevant for psychopathy</a>, including increased novelty-seeking and decreased avoidance of harm in people, and also to personality in chimps.</p>
<p>The team also considered each chimp’s gender (as there are sex differences in the vasopressin system) and also, given extensive work finding that genes can interact with early life experience to influence behaviour, whether each animal had been reared by its own mother (119 had been) or, because of maternal neglect, or illness or injury, the chimp had been reared, for its own wellbeing, from a very early age by people (59 fell into this category).</p>
<p>For chimps reared by their own mothers, whether they had a common polymorphism in a key region of AVPR1A was correlated with their score on disinhibition. Variations in the AVPR1A gene also correlated with scores for boldness, and the animals’ total psychopathy scores. But for chimps reared by people, there was no relationship between their AVPR1A genotype and their CHMP-Tri scores.</p>
<p>While the team didn’t directly measure vasopressin levels, the results are consistent with the idea that genetically determined levels of vasopressin contribute to psychopathic tendencies, and  “provide additional compelling evidence that psychopathic tendencies are rooted in basic, evolutionarily-meaningful dispositions,” the team writes. The results also, of course, show an important role for the environmental factor of rearing experience (perhaps roughly equivalent to parenting or foster care experiences for children).</p>
<p>It would be interesting to know more about the interaction between early care-giver experiences and the heritability of psychopathy. In <a href="http://latzmanlab.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Latzman-et-al-in-press-Etiology-of-Triarchic-Psychopathy-Dimensions-in-Chimpanzees.pdf">another paper </a>published this year by some of the authors of the current research and others, nursery-reared chimps scored significantly higher on the measure of disinhibition than those reared by their own mothers, though there was no relationship between rearing environment and either boldness or meanness. Might the higher disinhibition scores among the nursery-reared animals overwhelm, then, any effect of variations in AVPR1A (thus explaining why the gene was unrelated to psychopathic traits in nursery-reared chimps in the current research)? Or is something else going on?</p>
<p>The US National Institutes of Health has scaled back some studies involving chimpanzees. But Latzman and his colleagues argue that ethically sound and scientifically justifiable studies could (alongside studies of people) provide valuable insights into biological and behavioural processes relevant not just to psychopathy but to psychological illness more broadly.</p>

                <h4><a href="http://feeds.nature.com/~r/NatureBiologicalSciencesResearch/~3/551RoyDy8Q0/nature23483">New evidence for mammaliaform ear evolution and feeding adaptation in a Jurassic ecosystem</a></h4>

<p>
 Stem mammaliaforms are forerunners to modern mammals, and they achieved considerable ecomorphological diversity in their own right. Recent discoveries suggest that eleutherodontids, a subclade of Haramiyida, were more species-rich during the Jurassic period in Asia than previously recognized. Here we report a new Jurassic eleutherodontid mammaliaform with an unusual mosaic of highly specialized characteristics, and the results of phylogenetic analyses that support the hypothesis that haramiyidans are stem mammaliaforms. The new fossil shows fossilized skin membranes that are interpreted to be for gliding and a mandibular middle ear with a unique character combination previously unknown in mammaliaforms. Incisor replacement is prolonged until well after molars are fully erupted, a timing pattern unique to most other mammaliaforms. In situ molar occlusion and a functional analysis reveal a new mode of dental occlusion: dual mortar–pestle occlusion of opposing upper and lower molars, probably for dual crushing and grinding. This suggests that eleutherodontids are herbivorous, and probably specialized for granivory or feeding on soft plant tissues. The inferred dietary adaptation of eleutherodontid gliders represents a remarkable evolutionary convergence with herbivorous gliders in Theria. These Jurassic fossils represent volant, herbivorous stem mammaliaforms associated with pre-angiosperm plants that appear long before the later, iterative associations between angiosperm plants and volant herbivores in various therian clades.

<p>
 Stem mammaliaforms are Mesozoic forerunners to mammals, and they offer critical evidence for the anatomical evolution and ecological diversification during the earliest mammalian history. Two new eleutherodonts from the Late Jurassic period have skin membranes and skeletal features that are adapted for gliding. Characteristics of their digits provide evidence of roosting behaviour, as in dermopterans and bats, and their feet have a calcaneal calcar to support the uropagatium as in bats. The new volant taxa are phylogenetically nested with arboreal eleutherodonts. Together, they show an evolutionary experimentation similar to the iterative evolutions of gliders within arboreal groups of marsupial and placental mammals. However, gliding eleutherodonts possess rigid interclavicle–clavicle structures, convergent to the avian furculum, and they retain shoulder girdle plesiomorphies of mammaliaforms and monotremes. Forelimb mobility required by gliding occurs at the acromion–clavicle and glenohumeral joints, is different from and convergent to the shoulder mobility at the pivotal clavicle–sternal joint in marsupial and placental gliders.

                <h4><a href="http://feeds.nature.com/~r/NatureBiologicalSciencesResearch/~3/IGtWNCCjupU/nature23456">New infant cranium from the African Miocene sheds light on ape evolution</a></h4>

<p>
 The evolutionary history of extant hominoids (humans and apes) remains poorly understood. The African fossil record during the crucial time period, the Miocene epoch, largely comprises isolated jaws and teeth, and little is known about ape cranial evolution. Here we report on the, to our knowledge, most complete fossil ape cranium yet described, recovered from the 13 million-year-old Middle Miocene site of Napudet, Kenya. The infant specimen, KNM-NP 59050, is assigned to a new species of Nyanzapithecus on the basis of its unerupted permanent teeth, visualized by synchrotron imaging. Its ear canal has a fully ossified tubular ectotympanic, a derived feature linking the species with crown catarrhines. Although it resembles some hylobatids in aspects of its morphology and dental development, it possesses no definitive hylobatid synapomorphies. The combined evidence suggests that nyanzapithecines were stem hominoids close to the origin of extant apes, and that hylobatid-like facial features evolved multiple times during catarrhine evolution.

<p>
 Associating stimuli with positive or negative reinforcement is essential for survival, but a complete wiring diagram of a higher-order circuit supporting associative memory has not been previously available. Here we reconstruct one such circuit at synaptic resolution, the Drosophila larval mushroom body. We find that most Kenyon cells integrate random combinations of inputs but that a subset receives stereotyped inputs from single projection neurons. This organization maximizes performance of a model output neuron on a stimulus discrimination task. We also report a novel canonical circuit in each mushroom body compartment with previously unidentified connections: reciprocal Kenyon cell to modulatory neuron connections, modulatory neuron to output neuron connections, and a surprisingly high number of recurrent connections between Kenyon cells. Stereotyped connections found between output neurons could enhance the selection of learned behaviours. The complete circuit map of the mushroom body should guide future functional studies of this learning and memory centre.

<p>
 Genetic evidence for anatomically modern humans (AMH) out of Africa before 75 thousand years ago (ka) and in island southeast Asia (ISEA) before 60 ka (93–61 ka) predates accepted archaeological records of occupation in the region. Claims that AMH arrived in ISEA before 60 ka (ref. 4) have been supported only by equivocal or non-skeletal evidence. AMH evidence from this period is rare and lacks robust chronologies owing to a lack of direct dating applications, poor preservation and/or excavation strategies and questionable taxonomic identifications. Lida Ajer is a Sumatran Pleistocene cave with a rich rainforest fauna associated with fossil human teeth. The importance of the site is unclear owing to unsupported taxonomic identification of these fossils and uncertainties regarding the age of the deposit, therefore it is rarely considered in models of human dispersal. Here we reinvestigate Lida Ajer to identify the teeth confidently and establish a robust chronology using an integrated dating approach. Using enamel–dentine junction morphology, enamel thickness and comparative morphology, we show that the teeth are unequivocally AMH. Luminescence and uranium-series techniques applied to bone-bearing sediments and speleothems, and coupled uranium-series and electron spin resonance dating of mammalian teeth, place modern humans in Sumatra between 73 and 63 ka. This age is consistent with biostratigraphic estimations, palaeoclimate and sea-level reconstructions, and genetic evidence for a pre-60 ka arrival of AMH into ISEA. Lida Ajer represents, to our knowledge, the earliest evidence of rainforest occupation by AMH, and underscores the importance of reassessing the timing and environmental context of the dispersal of modern humans out of Africa.

<p>
 N6-methyladenosine (m6A) is the most common and abundant messenger RNA modification, modulated by ‘writers’, ‘erasers’ and ‘readers’ of this mark. In vitro data have shown that m6A influences all fundamental aspects of mRNA metabolism, mainly mRNA stability, to determine stem cell fates. However, its in vivo physiological function in mammals and adult mammalian cells is still unknown. Here we show that the deletion of m6A ‘writer’ protein METTL3 in mouse T cells disrupts T cell homeostasis and differentiation. In a lymphopaenic mouse adoptive transfer model, naive Mettl3-deficient T cells failed to undergo homeostatic expansion and remained in the naive state for up to 12 weeks, thereby preventing colitis. Consistent with these observations, the mRNAs of SOCS family genes encoding the STAT signalling inhibitory proteins SOCS1, SOCS3 and CISH were marked by m6A, exhibited slower mRNA decay and showed increased mRNAs and levels of protein expression in Mettl3-deficient naive T cells. This increased SOCS family activity consequently inhibited IL-7-mediated STAT5 activation and T cell homeostatic proliferation and differentiation. We also found that m6A has important roles for inducible degradation of Socs mRNAs in response to IL-7 signalling in order to reprogram naive T cells for proliferation and differentiation. Our study elucidates for the first time, to our knowledge, the in vivo biological role of m6A modification in T-cell-mediated pathogenesis and reveals a novel mechanism of T cell homeostasis and signal-dependent induction of mRNA degradation.

<p>
 Lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) is a bioactive lipid composed of a phosphate group, a glycerol backbone, and a single acyl chain that varies in length and saturation. LPA activates six class A G-protein-coupled receptors to provoke various cellular reactions. Because LPA signalling has been implicated in cancer and fibrosis, the LPA receptors are regarded as promising drug targets. The six LPA receptors are subdivided into the endothelial differentiation gene (EDG) family (LPA1–LPA3) and the phylogenetically distant non-EDG family (LPA4–LPA6). The structure of LPA1 has enhanced our understanding of the EDG family of LPA receptors. By contrast, the functional and pharmacological characteristics of the non-EDG family of LPA receptors have remained unknown, owing to the lack of structural information. Although the non-EDG LPA receptors share sequence similarity with the P2Y family of nucleotide receptors, the LPA recognition mechanism cannot be deduced from the P2Y1 and P2Y12 structures because of the large differences in the chemical structures of their ligands. Here we determine the 3.2 Å crystal structure of LPA6, the gene deletion of which is responsible for congenital hair loss, to clarify the ligand recognition mechanism of the non-EDG family of LPA receptors. Notably, the ligand-binding pocket of LPA6 is laterally open towards the membrane, and the acyl chain of the lipid used for the crystallization is bound within this pocket, indicating the binding mode of the LPA acyl chain. Docking and mutagenesis analyses also indicated that the conserved positively charged residues within the central cavity recognize the phosphate head group of LPA by inducing an inward shift of transmembrane helices 6 and 7, suggesting that the receptor activation is triggered by this conformational rearrangement.

<p>
 A fundamental principle in biology is that the program for early development is established during oogenesis in the form of the maternal transcriptome. How the maternal transcriptome acquires the appropriate content and dosage of transcripts is not fully understood. Here we show that 3′ terminal uridylation of mRNA mediated by TUT4 and TUT7 sculpts the mouse maternal transcriptome by eliminating transcripts during oocyte growth. Uridylation mediated by TUT4 and TUT7 is essential for both oocyte maturation and fertility. In comparison to somatic cells, the oocyte transcriptome has a shorter poly(A) tail and a higher relative proportion of terminal oligo-uridylation. Deletion of TUT4 and TUT7 leads to the accumulation of a cohort of transcripts with a high frequency of very short poly(A) tails, and a loss of 3′ oligo-uridylation. By contrast, deficiency of TUT4 and TUT7 does not alter gene expression in a variety of somatic cells. In summary, we show that poly(A) tail length and 3′ terminal uridylation have essential and specific functions in shaping a functional maternal transcriptome.

                <h4><a href="http://feeds.nature.com/~r/NatureBiologicalSciencesResearch/~3/R8mejN8lWIs/nature23299">Rewiring the taste system</a></h4>

<p>
 In mammals, taste buds typically contain 50–100 tightly packed taste-receptor cells (TRCs), representing all five basic qualities: sweet, sour, bitter, salty and umami. Notably, mature taste cells have life spans of only 5–20 days and, consequently, are constantly replenished by differentiation of taste stem cells. Given the importance of establishing and maintaining appropriate connectivity between TRCs and their partner ganglion neurons (that is, ensuring that a labelled line from sweet TRCs connects to sweet neurons, bitter TRCs to bitter neurons, sour to sour, and so on), we examined how new connections are specified to retain fidelity of signal transmission. Here we show that bitter and sweet TRCs provide instructive signals to bitter and sweet target neurons via different guidance molecules (SEMA3A and SEMA7A). We demonstrate that targeted expression of SEMA3A or SEMA7A in different classes of TRCs produces peripheral taste systems with miswired sweet or bitter cells. Indeed, we engineered mice with bitter neurons that now responded to sweet tastants, sweet neurons that responded to bitter or sweet neurons responding to sour stimuli. Together, these results uncover the basic logic of the wiring of the taste system at the periphery, and illustrate how a labelled-line sensory circuit preserves signalling integrity despite rapid and stochastic turnover of receptor cells.

                <h4><a href="http://feeds.nature.com/~r/NatureBiologicalSciencesResearch/~3/KV7Hef0xsVs/nature23021">Global patterns of drought recovery</a></h4>

<p>
 Drought, a recurring phenomenon with major impacts on both human and natural systems, is the most widespread climatic extreme that negatively affects the land carbon sink. Although twentieth-century trends in drought regimes are ambiguous, across many regions more frequent and severe droughts are expected in the twenty-first century. Recovery time—how long an ecosystem requires to revert to its pre-drought functional state—is a critical metric of drought impact. Yet the factors influencing drought recovery and its spatiotemporal patterns at the global scale are largely unknown. Here we analyse three independent datasets of gross primary productivity and show that, across diverse ecosystems, drought recovery times are strongly associated with climate and carbon cycle dynamics, with biodiversity and CO2 fertilization as secondary factors. Our analysis also provides two key insights into the spatiotemporal patterns of drought recovery time: first, that recovery is longest in the tropics and high northern latitudes (both vulnerable areas of Earth’s climate system) and second, that drought impacts (assessed using the area of ecosystems actively recovering and time to recovery) have increased over the twentieth century. If droughts become more frequent, as expected, the time between droughts may become shorter than drought recovery time, leading to permanently damaged ecosystems and widespread degradation of the land carbon sink.

<p>There are a lot of pairs of terms in psychology that sound as if they refer to the same thing, and can therefore be used interchangeably, when in fact they refer to different concepts that are distinct in important ways. As Emory University professor Scott Lilienfeld and his colleagues point out in <a href="http://journal.frontiersin.org/article/10.3389/feduc.2017.00037/full">their new open-access paper</a> in <em>Frontiers in Education</em>, even experienced psychologists and science communicators sometimes confuse these pairs of terms, which inevitably impedes their understanding of the underlying concepts.</p>
<p>Their new paper outlines 50 “frequently confused term pairs in psychology” from across different fields of psychology and related subjects. “Our list … should hopefully be a modest contribution toward enhancing psychological literacy and critical thinking in psychology more broadly,” they write.</p>
<p>Below we’ve highlighted 10 of the pairs of psychology terms that Lilienfeld and his co-authors believe you might be getting confused (check <a href="http://journal.frontiersin.org/article/10.3389/feduc.2017.00037/full">the full paper</a> for the other 40):</p>
<p><span id="more-28108"></span></p>
<p><strong>“Negative Reinforcement” versus “Punishment”</strong><br />
A few years ago <em>ABC news</em> reported “<a href="http://abcnews.go.com/International/story?id=80629">British Soccer Players Get Negative Reinforcement</a>“. The story was about the players who’d played badly being made to drive around in an old, uncool car. But this wasn’t negative reinforcement, it was a punishment: an unpleasant experience intended to deter future bad play. Negative reinforcement, by contrast, is a reward in the form of the removal of a previously unpleasant stimulus or experience, thus increasing the likelihood of the behaviour that preceded it.</p>
<p><strong>“Envy” versus “Jealousy”</strong><br />
A lot of us use these terms interchangeably not realising that envy is specifically about the dynamics between two people whereas jealousy involves three or more. A leading researcher in this area is psychologist Richard Smith. He <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/joy-and-pain/201401/what-is-the-difference-between-envy-and-jealousy">explains</a> at <em>Psychology Today</em>: “Envy occurs when we lack a desired attribute enjoyed by another” whereas “Jealousy occurs when something we already possess (usually a special relationship) is threatened by a third person”.</p>
<p><strong>“Antisocial” versus “Asocial”</strong><br />
Both sound very similar if we’re not paying attention. The clue of course is that the prefix “anti” means against, where as the prefix “a” means without. In psychology, anti-social is often used in the context of antisocial personality disorder, which describes a person who behaves against others, engaging “in reckless, irresponsible, and at times illegal behaviours” (to quote Lilenfeld et al). By contrast, an asocial person is “shy or disinterested in interpersonal contact”. Lilienfeld and his coauthors give the example of <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2015/09/01/introvert-myths_n_3569058.html">a Huffington Post article</a> that conflated this distinction, stating: “the idea that introverts are antisocial or don’t want the company of others is completely false”.</p>
<p><strong>“Obsession” versus “Compulsion”</strong><br />
Easy to confuse, but in terms of Obsessive Compulsive Disorder, obsessions are anxiety-generating repetitive thoughts, urges or images (e.g. “I feel dirty”, “I’ve been contaminated”), whereas compulsions are the behaviours or mental acts that the person performs to try to reduce their anxiety (e.g. hand washing).</p>
<p><strong>“Psychopathy” vs. “Sociopathy”</strong><br />
You might have heard an unpleasant character described as a sociopath and wondered if that’s the same or different from a psychopath. At least in the context of clinical and forensic psychology, Lilienfeld et al explain that a psychopathic personality is defined by a specific mix of features including superficial charm and callousness. Sociopathy on the other hand is not a formal or technical term, and it’s used to mean different things by different people, for example as a synonym for psychopath or to describe someone with a long history of criminal behaviour.</p>
<p><strong>“Serial killer” versus “Mass murderer”</strong><br />
While we’re on the subject of criminal characters, Lilienfeld et al also highlight an important distinction in forensic psychology between types of murderer: Serial killers (e.g. Peter Sutcliffe AKA the Yorkshire Ripper) kill “multiple people in a string of incidents that are separated by ‘cooling off’ periods,” while mass murderers (e.g. Thomas Hamilton, the perpetrator of the mass shooting at a Dunblane school) massacre “a large number of people in a single incident”. For completeness, Lilienfeld’s team add that spree killers form another group: like serial killers, they kill multiple people in separate incidents, but unlike serial killers their “homicidal episodes are not separated by clear-cut cooling-off periods”.</p>
<p><strong>“Mediator” versus “Moderator”</strong><br />
From types of killer to statistical nuance. As Lilienfeld at al explain, “A mediator is a variable, C, that intervenes between two correlated variables A and B, and that accounts at least in part … or entirely … for their statistical association.” Mediators speak to the why of an association. For example, <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2011/01/20/how-michael-jacksons-heal-the-world-really-could-help-heal-the-world/">a 2011 study</a> found that listening to prosocial songs like Michael Jackson’s Heal the World was associated with lower aggression and that this seemed to be partly mediated by the effect of the song on listeners’ mood rather than on their thoughts. A moderator, by contrast, “is a variable, C, that statistically affects the direction, magnitude, or both, of the relation between variables A and B”. Lilienfeld et al give the example of the association between negative life events and severity of illness, which is stronger for uncontrollable events (e.g. death of a spouse) than more controllable ones (e.g. divorce). “Moderators tend to address ‘when’, ‘for whom’, and ‘under which’ questions,” Lilienfeld explain.</p>
<p><strong>“Prevalence” versus “Incidence”</strong><br />
What proportion of the population have a mental health diagnosis? The answer would tell you the prevalence of mental health problems. How many people are newly diagnosed with mental health problems in a given year (or other time period)? The answer to that question would tell you the incidence. “More technically,” explain Lilienfeld et al, “prevalence equals incidence multiplied by duration.”</p>
<p><strong>“Coma” versus “Persistent Vegetative State”</strong><br />
Lilienfeld’s team place this one in their miscellaneous category. Coma and persistent vegetative state (PVS) are closely related, they explain, “but should be distinguished”. I covered misconceptions about these states and other disorders of consciousness at length <a href="https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=fBPyBQAAQBAJ&amp;q=coma#v=snippet&amp;q=coma&amp;f=false">in my 2014 book </a><em><a href="https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=fBPyBQAAQBAJ&amp;q=coma#v=snippet&amp;q=coma&amp;f=false">Great Myths of the Brain</a>. </em>While coma and PVS are both<em> </em>caused by brain damage and are associated with a lack of conscious awareness, there are important differences in the two states: Coma patients’ brains show no sign of a sleep wake cycle because of damage to the reticular system; in contrast PVS patients’ brains have an intact reticular system and show signs of a sleep wake cycle. Indeed, a PVS patient will usually have their eyes open during the wake part of the cycle (which can be confusing for loved ones and give false hope) and their eyes closed during the sleep phase. Also, coma patients are totally unresponsive whereas PVS patients often move and make sounds, and they may respond to noises and momentarily track moving targets with their eyes. Coma patients who survive but don’t wake up may progress to a PVS. If it is believed that a PVS patient has some rudimentary awareness, their diagnosis is changed to “minimally conscious state”.</p>
<p><strong>“Relapse” versus “Recurrence”</strong><br />
To grasp the distinction between relapse and recurrence, it helps also to realise the difference between “remission” from a psychological disorder (a full improvement that has lasted at least four months after treatment) and “recovery” (full improvement that’s lasted more than a year). According to Lilienfeld and his colleagues, relapse is when a condition returns after the start of remission but before recovery. Recurrence, by contrast, is when the condition returns after recovery.</p>

<p>– David Van Essen, 2003</p></blockquote>
<p>We love talking about cortex. It’s bumpy, it’s got layers, and it’s probably the brain structure that makes us the very verbal, skilled primates that we are.</p>
<p>We also love all of the different areas of cortex—there’s one for face recognition, another for motion detection, and many for decision-making. Often, labs stake claims on their cortical area of interest, diving deep into how that particular patch gets its job done.</p>
<p>But how well can we really divvy up that important sheet of tissue that makes us human? Can we confidently say we’ve left one area, and moved into the next? And how well can we translate these borders to smaller animal models, such as mice?</p>
<p><strong>Tiny brains with big aspirations</strong></p>
<p>Mice are super important to neuroscientists. Sure, they’re quite small and not exactly the most brilliant animals, but we’ve been able to engineer them to mark specific cell types, express glowing proteins, and more. As a result of this powerful murine toolbox, mice have gained a lot of attention from scientists who want to understand circuits and cell types in the brain. In particular, the <em>visual cortex</em> of the mouse has been the site of a lot of discussion, <a href="http://www.nature.com/news/neuroscience-through-the-eyes-of-a-mouse-1.13901" target="_blank">with many researchers</a> hoping that we could use our extensive knowledge about the coarse organization of the primate visual system to ask detailed questions in the mouse brain.</p>
<p>However, if we want to use powerful genetic and recording tools in mice, we first need to understand how their cortex is organized. So, many neuroscientists have been working to combine textbook knowledge about primate brain organization with novel techniques designed for the tiny mouse brain.</p>
<p>After a few landmark papers showing that mice have multiple visual areas like primates, the field immediately grabbed its two-photon microscopes and optical fibers and got to work. But as it turns out, mouse visual cortex isn’t <em>exactly</em> arranged like primate cortex, and many mouse researchers are left wondering if they have indeed isolated a meaningful cortical “area,” or a dubious patch of cortex. This challenge to disentangle the mouse brain has unearthed several fundamental questions about defining cortex.</p>
<p><strong>An age-old problem</strong></p>
<p>Fortunately for the new generation of mouse vision researchers, many before us have given careful thought to how we should consider the cortex. Primate researchers are quite familiar with the problem of defining cortical areas as well as the difficulties that arise when comparing across species. Multiple cortical partitioning schemes exist for macaque visual cortex and <a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S089662730700774X" target="_blank">mapping these areas onto humans</a> is quite contentious. In primates, there are 10-12 areas with clear organization, but <a href="http://brainmap.wustl.edu/resources/VisChapter.pdf" target="_blank">there is anatomical and functional evidence for more than 40 distinct visual areas</a>.</p>
<p><a href="http://blogs.plos.org/neuro/files/2017/08/Cortex_Jungle.png"><img alt="" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-19413" height="300" src="http://blogs.plos.org/neuro/files/2017/08/Cortex_Jungle-249x300.png" width="249" /></a>In an elegant book chapter on the topic, cortical map guru <a href="http://brainvis.wustl.edu/wiki/index.php/Main_Page" target="_blank">David Van Essen</a> lays out four ways to divide primate visual cortex: architecture, connectivity, retinotopy (an ordered map of the visual world), and functional specialization. Still, when we compare maps from these types of data they’re often conflicting, even in the relatively large primate brain.</p>
<p>Usefully, Van Essen also defines three frequent problems encountered when defining a cortical area. First, there may be subtle (or imprecise) boundaries between areas, and therefore ground truth is not easily defined. Second, areas may be internally heterogeneous, either because they have repetitive structures, asymmetric organization, or gradients of function. Last, areas may differ between individual animals. Even in primates, <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/6740964" target="_blank">primary visual cortex</a> and <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2449473" target="_blank">the middle temporal area</a> can vary two-fold or more in size between monkeys. And while anatomical boundaries are often used to locate these areas in primates, these landmarks are quite variable.</p>
<p><strong>The current state of cortex</strong></p>
<p><strong> </strong>In the past year or so, multiple studies have been released that are challenging our current conceptions of mouse and human cortex. <a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/18372" target="_blank">Research from the Allen Brain Institute</a> suggests that mice have even more visual areas than we previously thought—something on the order of <em>sixteen</em>. As in primates, many of these areas don’t clearly receive input from primary visual cortex, and some of them have really weak and/or partial maps of the visual world.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the research on human cortex is also getting a bit complicated. Using an enormous dataset from the <a href="http://www.humanconnectomeproject.org/" target="_blank">Human Connectome Project</a>, <a href="http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v536/n7615/full/nature18933.html?foxtrotcallback=true" target="_blank">Van Essen and his team identified 97 new cortical areas</a>. That’s more than double the number of areas previously reported. They were able to do this by using multiple sources of information about organization, such as the thickness of cortex, or the activity in a given area during resting state. Like all good big data papers, they used machine learning to train a classifier to determine area boundaries.</p>
<p>Both of these projects represent a new wave of approaches to integrate many types of data in order to accurately draw cortex area borders. Ultimately—as Van Essen himself once proposed—we may need to settle on probabilistic boundaries: area #1 <em>likely </em>ends here, and area #2 is <em>very</em> <em>likely </em>next door.</p>
<p>So as it turns out, dividing up the cortex isn’t as simple as separating yellow and red M&amp;Ms. However, with multiple types of anatomical and functional information across species, we’re hopefully moving towards a common framework for the widely-adored cortex.</p>

<img alt="" class="attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image" height="110" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2017/08/600px-Heteropterus.morpheus.2490-140x110.jpg" style="display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;" width="140" /><p>The number of beetle species on earth is more than the number of plant species. The number of species in butterflies and moths are likely less than half of beetle species on earth. Beetles, butterflies and moths along with all other insect species represent almost half of all eukaryotic species. What governs such variation in species diversity – why are some groups of organisms species rich, while others are species poor?</p>
<p>The pattern of species richness across different groups of organisms is broadly explained by the idea of ecological opportunity, which is based on two major components. First, evolution of a key character that provides the ability to utilize resources otherwise unavailable. Second, availability of the resources which can be facilitated through either extinction of competitive species or appearance of new resources or colonization to a new area.</p>
<figure class="wp-caption alignleft" id="attachment_9355" style="width: 810px;"><img alt="" class="size-full wp-image-9355" height="1040" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2017/08/800px-CogiaTyphedanus.jpg" width="800" /><div class="attachment-image--caption">This plate shows just a fraction of the species diversity within skipper butterflies.</div><div class="attachment-image--source"></div></figure>
<p>By investigating the pattern of associations of skipper butterflies and their larval hostplant, we show that the monocot-feeding skippers diversified much more rapidly than the dicot-feeding ones (monocot and dicot being the two major classes flowering plants are traditionally grouped in). As a result, the monocot-feeding group represents approximately equal number of species as that of the dicot-feeding group, although the monocot-feeding group originated more recently. However, different subgroups within the monocot-feeding group have diversified at different rates.</p>
<p>To uncover the plausible reasons that could have influenced the differential rate of diversification within the monocot-feeding group, we compared the time when monocot-feeding skippers originated with the time of paleoclimatic events. We find that paleoclimatic events at distinct geological times have influenced diversification of monocot-feeding skippers.</p>
<figure class="wp-caption alignleft" id="attachment_9354" style="width: 1290px;"><img alt="" class="size-full wp-image-9354" height="853" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2017/08/1280px-Brown_longtail_Urbanus_procne_2.jpg" width="1280" /><div class="attachment-image--caption">A brown longtail, a member of the skipper family</div><div class="attachment-image--source">Anne Toal, CC2.0</div></figure>
<p>First, one subgroup of monocot-feeding skippers diversified on forest dwelling monocots when these plants themselves diversified owing to high atmospheric temperature around 50 million years ago. This diversification occurred in present day Africa, South Asia, and South-East Asia. Second, expansion of grasslands in South America around 40 million years ago facilitated diversification of another subgroup of monocot-feeding skippers which are broadly specialized on grasses.</p>
<p>Collectively, our comparative analyses reveal that the increased diversification of skipper butterflies is due to (i) evolution of the ability to feed on monocots, and (ii) subsequent availability of diverse monocot plants over a wide geographical area. Although we are not certain about the underlying mechanisms that would have facilitated diversification of grass feeding skippers, we predict that the geographical isolation mediated as a consequence of grassland expansion was a prominent factor.</p>

<img alt="" class="attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image" height="110" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2017/08/lymphedema-povoski-review-2-140x110.jpg" style="display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;" width="140" /><p> </p>
<p>Lymphedema represents a generalized buildup of extracellular lymph fluid within the soft tissues of arms and legs. This results from an imbalance in the amount of lymphatic fluid that is being produced and the amount of lymphatic fluid that is being cleared from lymphatic channels into the venous circulatory system.</p>
<p>Lymphedema is categorized as either primary lymphedema or secondary lymphedema. Primary lymphedema is a relatively rare condition and results from intrinsic structural or functional issues in the lymphatic drainage system secondary to abnormalities in the structure and/or function of the lymphatic channels.</p>
<p>Secondary lymphedema is far more common and is the result of extrinsic disruption in lymphatic transport. In the more developed western world, this is most frequently caused by the traumatic surgical disruption of the normal lymphatic pathways. Cancer treatment, especially surgery and radiation therapy can result in the development of lymphedema. Breast cancer surgery is the most common cause of secondary lymphedema in the arms. atients whose axillary lymph nodes are removed or irradiated as part of their therapy are at particularly high risk of developing this condition, which can arise years after surgery. Lymphedema in the legs is most commonly associated with gynecologic cancers, urologic cancers, melanoma, and lymphoma.</p>
<p>Lymphedema has a major impact on the quality of life of affected patients, both in terms of increased morbidity and significant psychological effects. The skin and soft tissues of the affected limb become progressively swollen, firm, and tight feeling due to the buildup of entrapped lymphatic fluids. The swelling can feel uncomfortable or even painful, and may make movements more difficult. Most seriously, this condition makes the affected limb much more prone to repeated and potentially life-threatening skin and soft tissue infections. Many patients eventually develop depression as a consequence of the impact that lymphedema has on their well-being and their physical appearance.</p>
<figure class="wp-caption alignright" style="width: 368px;"><img alt="" height="269" src="http://media.springernature.com/lw785/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1186%2Fs12885-017-3444-9/MediaObjects/12885_2017_3444_Fig4_HTML.gif" width="358" /><div class="attachment-image--caption">Certified lymphedema therapist performing circumference tape measurements on a patient with breast cancer related right upper extremity lymphedema</div></figure>
<p>Currently, there is no cure for lymphedema, which will affect patients for the rest of their lives. However, both non-surgical and surgical management strategies exist that attempt to reduce the buildup of extracellular lymph fluid within the affected limb and thus improve symptoms and reduce the risk of complications.</p>
<p>The main non-surgical management strategy, Complex Decongestive Therapy (CDT), includes manual lymphatic drainage, compression therapy, exercise and skin care as well as a range of motion, breathing and posture exercises, and education.</p>
<p>Surgical management strategies include ablative surgical methods, which aim at removal of the tissues affected by lymphedema, and physiological surgical methods, which aim to recreate normal or alternate avenues for lymph fluid to flow out of the affected limb.</p>
<p>Ablative surgical methods can be significantly invasive, and are directed towards the removal of the edematous superficial tissue layers of the affected limb. This includes the Charles procedure and suction-assisted lipectomy/liposuction. The Charles procedure represents a somewhat radical surgical procedure in which varying degrees of involved skin and subcutaneous tissue are excised from the affected limb, and can require coverage with skin grafts. Suction-assisted lipectomy/liposuction represents a much less invasive surgical procedure in which excess fat is removed from the affected limb using a suction cannula and liposuction device that is passed under the skin through multiple small incisions.</p>
<p>Physiological surgical methods are directed towards reducing the lymphatic fluid burden in the affected limb by either improving lymphatic circulation by introducing healthy tissue into the affected limb or creating an alternate outflow pathway for lymph fluid. These methods require using sophisticated microsurgical and super-microsurgical techniques, to accomplish the physical reconnection of lymphatic channels to either small veins in the affected limb, or healthy lymphatic channels or tissues that can be harvested from other parts of the body.</p>
<p>While currently available surgical management strategies can result in dramatic improvement in symptoms and quality of life for patients, many formidable challenges remain for successful management of secondary lymphedema. It is hopeful that ongoing clinical research efforts will ultimately lead to more complete and sustainable treatment strategies and perhaps a cure for secondary lymphedema, its debilitating symptoms, and its potentially devastating resultant complications.</p>

<p>It sounds like a paradox – the idea that participating in aggressive sport can make people less aggressive. Yet this belief forms a core basis of many martial arts dating back thousands of years, and many famous practitioners (real and fictional) have preached the importance of self control.</p>
<p>Legendary martial artist Bruce Lee once noted that “emotion can be the enemy. If you give into your emotion, you lose yourself”. Or as Mr Miyagi said in <i>The Karate Kid</i> the “lesson is not just karate only, the lesson is for whole life”.</p>
<p>Previous research has demonstrated that this may well be the case, as participating in martial arts helps improve concentration and self-awareness, self-esteem, emotional stability and self-regulation.</p>
<p>But is it really true that martial arts also reduces aggression outside the dojo? Can participating in traditionally violent sports prove cathartic, helping young people develop self-discipline and in turn be less violent away from the sport? Writing in the journal of <i>Aggression and Violent Behaviour </i>researchers from Israel and America report their findings from the first <a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1359178917300976?dgcid=raven_sd_via_email">meta-analysis on the impact of martial arts on violent behaviours in children and teenagers.</a></p>
<p><span id="more-28078"></span></p>
<p>Anna Harwood and Michal Lavidor of Bar-Ilan University and Yuri Rassovsky of UCLA reviewed the existing research and found 300 potentially relevant papers. However, only twelve met their criteria for inclusion: they had to have a control group, as well as valid measures of the impact of martial arts on aggression, violence, anger or hostility.</p>
<p>Their analysis found that participating in martial arts did indeed have a significant impact in reducing aggression. Of the twelve studies reviewed, eleven showed a positive impact. Central to this was that martial arts reduced the rate of externalising behaviours in participants. Externalising behaviours included, but were not limited to, physical aggression, verbal and physical bullying, theft and vandalism. Through the teaching and practices of martial arts, participants were better able to gain a sense of control over both the situations and themselves, leading to less negative emotional responses and violent behaviours.  Statistically speaking, the average size of the effect of martial arts on these behaviours was 0.65, indicating a medium sized effect.</p>
<p>The results were consistent regardless of the participants’ age or gender. Likewise, the amount of time spent training and if they practised their martial arts either in or outside of school made no significant difference. Given that the studies reviewed comprised a range of methodologies, including both longitudinal random control trials, these findings carry significant weight.</p>
<p>However, this meta-analysis was somewhat hampered by the sheer paucity of quality studies to have looked at the impact of martial arts on children and teenagers. As the authors put it, “the research on martial arts is sparse and many studies lack the statistical integrity to include them in a robust meta-analysis”.</p>
<p>Of course there are many different martial arts and they all vary in their techniques and philosophy. Unfortunately, there has also been little research that has actively compared the impact that these different combat sports have on reducing aggression. This is because many of the studies to date have been on people who participate in a combination of martial arts.</p>
<p>The one study in this review that did report a negative impact on martial arts on aggressive behavior was on young boys participating in judo. This finding may have been due to the lack of meditation within the training sessions to help improve self control, which is a common aspect of many other martial arts. Further research would help us identify under which situations and which martial arts are most beneficial for helping adolescents with aggressive tendencies.</p>
<p>That being said, this review raises some exciting implications for martial arts as an intervention for delinquent teenagers, especially those who demonstrate serious and consistent anti-social behaviours, who are at increased risk of becoming lifelong offenders. Encouraging them to engage in traditional “self-help” programmes can be tricky so participating in martial arts could potentially offer a different route. As the authors of the study note, “while psychologically orientated programmes often receive the bulk of the scientific interest, troubled youth often do not co-operate with these traditional approaches. Martial arts, may both complement and form a basis for further cooperation in psychological therapies”.</p>
<p>Compared to more traditional methods to reduce aggression, martial arts offer a cost-effective and fun alternative to enhance mental well-being. More research is clearly needed, but these initial findings are promising and seem to confirm the long-held paradoxical belief that participating in combat sports can help reduce rates of violence, anger and aggression.</p>

                <h4><a href="http://feeds.nature.com/~r/NatureBiologicalSciencesResearch/~3/TaY22kZXZj0/nature23477">Identification of essential genes for cancer immunotherapy</a></h4>

<p>
 Somatic gene mutations can alter the vulnerability of cancer cells to T-cell-based immunotherapies. Here we perturbed genes in human melanoma cells to mimic loss-of-function mutations involved in resistance to these therapies, by using a genome-scale CRISPR–Cas9 library that consisted of around 123,000 single-guide RNAs, and profiled genes whose loss in tumour cells impaired the effector function of CD8+ T cells. The genes that were most enriched in the screen have key roles in antigen presentation and interferon-γ signalling, and correlate with cytolytic activity in patient tumours from The Cancer Genome Atlas. Among the genes validated using different cancer cell lines and antigens, we identified multiple loss-of-function mutations in APLNR, encoding the apelin receptor, in patient tumours that were refractory to immunotherapy. We show that APLNR interacts with JAK1, modulating interferon-γ responses in tumours, and that its functional loss reduces the efficacy of adoptive cell transfer and checkpoint blockade immunotherapies in mouse models. Our results link the loss of essential genes for the effector function of CD8+ T cells with the resistance or non-responsiveness of cancer to immunotherapies.

                <h4><a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/neuroskeptic/?p=9019">Spreadsheet Risks in Science</a></h4>

Errors in the use of spreadsheets such as Microsoft Excel could pose risks for science.

That's according to a preprint posted on arXiv from Ghada AlTarawneh and Simon Thorne of Cardiff Metropolitan University.



AlTarawneh and Thorne conducted a survey of 17 researchers from the University of Newcastle neuroscience research centre, ranging from PhD students to senior researchers. None of the respondants had any formal, certified training in spreadsheet use, with most (71%) being self-tau

<p>The week at Retraction Watch featured the retraction of a 35-year-old paper written by a cat, and the retraction of a study about a controversial gene editing technique. Here’s what was happening elsewhere: A BS detector for science? “Science is still the best way of knowing stuff. Darpa just wants to know what stuff science […]</p>
