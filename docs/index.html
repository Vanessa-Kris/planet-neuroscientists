                <h4><a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/neuroskeptic/?p=8769">Sergio Canavero: Will His Head Transplants Roll?</a></h4>

Will the first human head transplant happen soon? According to Sergio Canavero, it will - and he'll be the man to do it.





In 2015, Canavero announced his intention to carry out the pioneering operation, with the head being that of a Russian man, Valery Spiridonov, who has a muscle degenerative disease. The source of the donor body was never specified. More recently, Canavero has said that a Chinese patient will be the first to have their head transplanted.

So who is Sergio Canavero,

<p>You’ve just had a fight with your partner or a confrontation with a colleague. Now your heart’s racing, and you’re struggling to think straight. What should you do?</p>
<p>Psychologists are not short on ideas for how to calm yourself down after a stressful experience. Seek out a friend? Yes, there’s good evidence that can help. But what if there’s no friend to hand? You could try to alter your view of what just happened from “Disaster!” to “Not really so bad”.</p>
<p>But it can be difficult to engage in this kind of “cognitive reappraisal” when you’re in the immediate aftermath of a stressful event – perhaps because acute stress compromises the neural circuitry that’s involved in emotion regulation.</p>
<p>Your brain needs help if it’s to quickly regain control. And, according to a <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41562-017-0093">new study</a> published in <i>Nature Human Behaviour</i>, you can provide it by thinking back over good times.</p>
<p><span id="more-23913"></span></p>
<p>Mauricio Delgado and Megan Speer at Rutgers University, US, made 134 volunteers feel stressed by videoing them while they plunged their hands into icy water. Some then spent 14 seconds reminiscing about a positive experience (like visiting Disneyland) while others reflected on an emotionally neutral event (such as getting luggage ready for the trip).</p>
<p>Afterwards, the group who’d recalled happy memories felt better, but not only that: the expected rise in their levels of the stress hormone cortisol was only 15 per cent, on average, of the surge observed in the neutral memory group. Thinking about happy memories, then, went right to the heart of the physiological stress response.</p>
<p>To explore how, Delgado and Speer used the same technique as before to stress a fresh group of volunteers and then had them reminisce about their own positive or neutral experiences while they scanned their brains using fMRI. The pair found that recollecting good, but not neutral, memories was associated with increased activity in prefrontal brain regions associated with emotion regulation and cognitive control – the same regions suppressed by acute stress – as well as in corticostriatal regions associated with the processing of reward.</p>
<p>“Engagement of cortical regions previously linked to emotion regulatory functions may be significant for enhancing or sustaining pleasant feelings during positive reminiscence, thus dampening the physiological stress response,” the researchers concluded.</p>
<p>The idea that thinking about positive past events, including achievements or successes, can help to improve ongoing mood and resilience to stress is certainly not new. But showing that simply recalling happy memories can combat acute stress at a physical level is important, since there’s plenty of research finding that people who tend to calm down physiologically soon after stressful events are generally healthier, both physically and psychologically, over the long term.</p>
<p>There are a few caveats. This work was on healthy adults. People with depression usually find it hard to recall positive memories, so this technique may not work well for them. And it’s not clear yet whether any technique that makes you feel positive emotions would be effective or if there’s something special about reminiscing. But this is at least a simple method, and one that in theory many people could try.</p>

<img alt="" class="attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image" height="110" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2017/05/shutterstock_115143340-140x110.jpg" style="display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;" width="140" /><p>Nurses are one of the largest and most vital workforces in healthcare. With the ever-changing processes and continuing advances in hospitals, they still need to meet expectations of both hospital management and patients whilst providing even more complex patient care.</p>
<p>As a result, nurses often describe their days as demanding, erratic, and both mentally and emotionally draining. These are some of the reasons why there is so much work-related stress, job dissatisfaction and poor personal health associated with the nursing profession.</p>
<p>Burnout, a state of physical and emotional exhaustion, is relatively common for those in healthcare professions. A <a href="https://bmcnurs.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12912-016-0200-4">study </a>in <em><a href="https://bmcnurs.biomedcentral.com/">BMC Nursing</a></em> has investigated the factors which impact both this and work engagement in nurses through detailed interviewing. Collaboration with staff was seen as essential for effective workload balance but this was not always easy to attain, and nurses voiced clear frustration as a result.</p>
<p>It also became apparent that the need to provide increasingly complex patient care for chronic conditions coupled with a shortage of hospital staff causes a great deal of strain on nurses. In this study, one of the nurses even claimed “Our management expects good patient care quality but with a decrease of care personal … not <em>easy.”</em> Unsurprisingly, nurse managers also admitted that high workloads could affect quality of patient care and safety, not least of all because nurses become unable to socially interact with their patients and may be more prone to making mistakes.</p>
<p>The concerns regarding staff shortage has been echoed in many papers. One such example is a local <a href="https://bmcresnotes.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13104-017-2492-1">study </a>published in <em><a href="https://bmcresnotes.biomedcentral.com/">BMC Research Notes</a></em> in which the combination of staff shortage, manual lifting and overtime hours was associated with a high prevalence of lower back pain in nurses in Bangladesh.</p>
<p>In a <a href="https://bmcobes.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s40608-017-0154-4">paper </a>in <em><a href="https://bmcobes.biomedcentral.com/">BMC Obesity</a></em>, nurses also stated that factors such as poor staffing, shift patterns, lack of breaks, hospital policies and the cost of food options can promote unhealthy behavioural habits, such as poor eating and inadequate physical activity. Nurses said they were left with “chips or burgers or things like that” during their night shifts and that, in general, working shifts made eating healthy “quite a struggle.”</p>
<p>The interviewed nurses mentioned that some of the issues could be resolved by offering more flexible shift hours – this would allow them the time for exercise, coping with family demands, and adequate sleep.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the papers suggested that a management which ensures a stimulating, positive environment would boost work engagement. This would strengthen self-confidence, resilience and professional independence, provide learning opportunities for personal development, and promote supportive staff relationships.</p>
<p>It’s important to note that these studies all converge on the same conclusion – we need to achieve a healthy nursing workforce. It follows on that only by actively addressing challenges raised and faced by our nurses, can we strengthen the quality and safety of our healthcare.</p>

                <h4><a href="http://brainblogger.com/2017/05/11/motor-neurons-why-are-they-important-and-how-are-they-made/">Motor Neurons – Why Are They Important and How Are They Made?</a></h4>

<p>Motor neurons are the nerve cells in the body responsible for controlling movement.  A number of diseases are caused by damage to motor neurons, including amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and spinal muscular atrophy (SMA).  In order to treat these diseases, scientists are developing methods to generate new, healthy motor neurons from stem cells. A recent study has elucidated the cellular mechanisms that control the motor neuron differentiation, paving the way for new treatments for motor neuron diseases. </p>
<p>Each time we voluntarily move an arm or leg, or when our lungs involuntarily expand and contract, signals from the brain are sent along a chain to the spinal cord, where motor neuron cell bodies reside. These motor neurons terminate in muscle cells, where they transmit the nerve impulses in order to produce muscle contractions. In ALS, there is a progressive destruction of motor neurons due to either a genetic defect or an unknown environmental trigger. Motor neuron damage in ALS leads to progressive muscle weakness that affects all parts of the body, impairing the ability to speak, swallow, and eventually breathe. SMA is caused by gene mutations and is characterized by similarly progressive damage to motor neurons that causes muscle weakness. If respiratory muscles are affected, SMA can be fatal.</p>
<p>Scientists aim to develop gene therapies for these diseases that can repair the damaged motor neurons and improve the functioning and lifespan of patients. To do this, they must first understand the signals that induce motor neuron development from stem cells. Stem cells are the precursors for every type of cell in the body. They are triggered to differentiate into various cell types via cellular signaling molecules called transcription factors, which act on DNA to turn on specific genes. Which genes are turned on will determine the phenotypic fate of each cell. Typically, each cell goes through several stages of development before reaching its final fate.</p>
<p>A group of researchers from several universities recently teamed up to elucidate these programming pathways. They had previously discovered that a group of transcription factors called the NIL factors – Ngn2, Isl1, and Lhx3 – can induce motor neuron development from embryonic stem cells without passing through any of the intermediate stages. Moreover, the NIL factors achieved the transition to the motor neuron fate with a 90% success rate, and the process took only two days. This so-called direct programming pathway was an exciting finding with respect to clinical applications, because it can be achieved both <em>in vitro</em> and in living organisms at the site of cell damage.</p>
<p>In the current study published in the journal <em>Cell Stem Cell</em>, Esteban Mazzoni and colleagues further investigated the process by which transcription factors bind to and activate parts of DNA during the first 48 hours after NIL expression. First, the researchers used single-cell RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) to study the timing of gene expression after induction by NIL programming factors. RNA-seq is a technique that reveals the presence and quantity of RNA in a sample at a specific point in time. Thus, as transcription factors turn genes on, these genes are transcribed into RNA that can be measured and quantified.</p>
<p>The researchers also studied chromatin remodeling during motor neuron programming. Chromatin is a tightly-packed form of DNA which regulates the expression of genes through changes in its structure.  Promoters are regions of the DNA where transcription factors bind in order to initiate gene transcription.  Chromatin must undergo structural changes, called remodeling, in order for the DNA to be accessible to transcription factors. Typically, as cells move through the differentiation process, chromatin changes that occur at promoter regions will restrict the differentiation potential of the cell.</p>
<p>To study this chromatin remodeling process, a ChIP-seq time series was performed.  ChIP-seq combines chromatin immunoprecipitation with DNA sequencing to identify the binding sites of proteins that associate with DNA.  Antibodies against the bound proteins are used to extract protein-DNA complexes, and the DNA binding sites can be sequenced. In addition, the researchers used an assay for transposase-accessible chromatin with high throughput sequencing (ATAC-seq) to study chromatin accessibility.  Proteins called transposons incorporate into exposed, or accessible, portions of chromatin. Therefore, identifying the locations of transposons in the DNA can indicate what parts of the DNA are being actively transcribed, or turned on.</p>
<p>This series of experiments revealed information about how genes are turned on and off over the 48-hour process of motor neuron formation.  Initially, the transcription factors Ngn2 and Isl1/Lhx3 induce different sets of genes in parallel. Whereas Ngn2 controls genes associated with generic neuronal differentiation, Isl1 and Lhx3  activate genes specific for spinal cord and motor neurons. As programming progresses, Ngn2 induces the expression of two other transcription factors, Ebf and Onecut. These transcription factors modify the chromatin state to enable Isl1/Lhx3 binding to previously inaccessible sites on the DNA that contain the terminal motor neuron genes necessary to complete the programming process.</p>
<p>These experiments showed that the activities of Ngn2 and Isl1/Lhx3 act in tandem to induce direct motor neuron programming from stem cells. The researchers hope to apply these findings clinically. By triggering this programming pathway in the body, cells in the spinal cord can be induced to differentiate into motor neurons, replacing the neurons that are damaged in diseases such as ALS.</p>

<p>A cancer biologist at Harvard who’s issued multiple editorial notices in recent years has received an expression of concern about a 2011 paper, citing “credible concerns” with the data and conclusions. The publisher does not detail the nature of the issues in the notice. In the past few years, last author Sam W. Lee lost a Molecular Cell paper in 2013 due to figure […]</p>

<p><em>By</em> <a href="http://www.alexfradera.net/">Alex Fradera</a></p>
<p>Most employers like their workers to think of themselves not as employees but as “citizens” of the organisation, proactively engaging in activities like helping others out or coming up with company improvements – activities that aren’t specified in a job description yet help the organisation thrive. But more and more, these supposedly discretional citizenship behaviours are being demanded by managers more overtly – outlined in ‘The Way We Work’ documents, or threatened informally as necessary to get ahead. Now <a href="http://amj.aom.org/content/60/1/373.abstract?etoc">an article</a> in the <i>Academy of Management Journal</i> suggests being forced to be a good citizen has some perverse consequences: when you’re grudgingly good, you become blasé about doing bad.</p>
<p><span id="more-23886"></span></p>
<p>Kai Chi Yam’s international team started their investigations by canvassing teams of mainly male workers spread across organisations in industries including banking, telecommunications and manufacturing. They asked managers of the 345 participants to estimate how much they engaged in citizenship behaviours – e.g. “initiates assistance to coworkers who have a heavy workload” – and then asked the participants themselves the reasons why they would do these sorts of things, with some of the reasons pointing towards top-down coercion (“I’ll get in trouble if I don’t”). Yam found that participants who performed more citizenship behaviours due to duress were also more likely to admit to deviant work behaviours, like stealing supplies or making fun of a co-worker.</p>
<p>The reason for this appears to be that enforced good citizenship was associated with higher levels of psychological entitlement, with individuals affirming ideas like “I deserve more things in my life.” Being required to do good meant that they subsequently felt licensed to bend the rules.</p>
<p>In the next survey, using a US sample of 180 participants and their managers, Yam wanted to explore just how far this “moral licence” extends. Again, participants who were better workplace citizens committed more workplace deviance when the good behaviour was imposed top-down. But in addition, Yam found the same effect was true for non-workplace deviance: participants obliged to be good citizens at work were more likely to admit to misdeeds in their own time, such as swearing at someone.</p>
<p>This last finding suggests that these participants felt that they had earned a universal carte blanche to act as they will, and provides evidence against an alternative explanation that they were only committing the deviant acts to take revenge on the organisation they felt had mistreated them.</p>
<p>A final study used an experimental manipulation – asking participants to think about a time they committed a good behaviour, and then rating the extent to which it was imposed on them – to reproduce the effect under laboratory conditions. In this case, participants remembering a time they were forced to be good were more likely to cheat at a self-marked maths test. All in all, the evidence suggests that obliging people to be better citizens encourages them to relax their intrinsic moral guidelines and engage in negative behaviour they would otherwise tend to avoid.</p>
<p>It’s so tempting for organisations to expect more and more from their employees – and so much harder for employees to resist when they are being asked to do socially desirable things like “help out” and “think about the organisation”. But by making such behaviours expected or even mandatory, we can box people into regulated systems that rob these activities of their intrinsic motivation and instead make them into burdens, burdens that can boomerang back on the organisation and even beyond. Demanding we behave like saints risks turning us into sinners.</p>

<p>Biological computational modelling is a powerful tool to simulate a system and draw conclusions regarding its function. It also allows to make predictions for processes that still haven’t been investigated in the laboratory. NEURON [1, 2] is an simulation environment, where empirical data are combined with analytic mathematical expressions, in order to model single neurons or neural networks. Neuronal cells are created as a series of connected sections, able to form realistic morphologies, and where different membrane properties (ionic, synaptic and passive) can be inserted. The interface and programming syntax are designed to offer an intuitive environment and emphasise on the biological functions in detail, rather than the the programming or numerical methods.
The purpose of this workshop is to give an introduction to the NEURON software and how it could be used, by building a simple neuronal cell model and testing its behaviour under different conditions.</p>

Arbitrary and unfair behavior by scientific journals risks damaging the public's perception of science.

Two weeks ago, the Journal of Translational Science published a paper that reported a correlation between vaccination and autism in 666 children. On Monday, the paper disappeared from their website, with no explanation or retraction notice. Google's cache still has the paper here. Retraction Watch has more details.





In my view, this journal's behavior is a perfect illustration of

<blockquote><p>“When you say it’s gonna happen now<br />
When exactly do you mean?”</p></blockquote>
<p>Ask a psychologist the answer to this question – posed in this case by Morrissey in <i>The</i> <i>Smiths</i> song, <i>How soon is now</i>? – and she might reply “within the next three seconds”.</p>
<p>The idea that “now”, also known as the “subjective present”, is constrained within this time limit has proved popular<b>.</b> But a <a href="http://psycnet.apa.org/psycinfo/2017-14703-001/">new evaluation</a> in <i>Psychological Bulletin</i> of dozens of research papers on everything from embraces and reading poetry to tapping along to a beat concludes that there’s no good evidence for it. Our experience of the present cannot, it seems, be so strictly defined.</p>
<p><span id="more-23769"></span></p>
<p>Plenty of events that we perceive as happening at the same time actually don’t quite co-occur, of course. An intriguing illustration of this comes, for example, from the neurological patient known in the literature as <a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0010945213000890">PH</a>. This man hears people’s voices before he registers the movement of their lips. At first, he thought the TV wasn’t correctly dubbed, but then he realised the same thing was happening with people he was talking to. Evaluation of his case led the researchers involved to conclude that there are various clocks in the brain, and PH has developed problems with the coordination of those linked to vision and hearing.</p>
<p>Still, there’s only about a 200-millisecond time difference between our brain’s processing of the sight of someone’s lips moving and the sound of their voice. So how big can a discrepancy get for a healthy brain not only to cease perceiving events as simultaneous, but to stop binding perceptions together into “the present”?</p>
<p>In his new critique of the three-second theory, Peter White at Cardiff University first considers evidence put forward from experiments into duration perception: if someone sounds a tone for two seconds, say, or eight seconds, how good is somebody else at holding down a button for the same length of time?</p>
<p>Ernst Pöppel at the Ludwig-Maximillian University of Munich, Germany, has claimed that at about three seconds or under, we’re accurate, but beyond that, we under-estimate durations – which, he’s argued, supports the idea of two different brain processing modes: one for events that last less than three seconds, and one for events that take longer. This supports the idea that “now” lasts up to three seconds, he argues. In fact, a clear-cut boundary between performance below or over three-second durations does not exist, argues White. Rather, it seems that as the duration of a tone gradually gets longer, our performance tends to gradually worsen, too, and there’s no clear evidence of a shift in accuracy at the three-second mark.</p>
<p>How about work investigating how well we can tap along to a beat? While some studies support the idea that we’re relatively accurate when the beat intervals are less than three seconds (which, again, Pöppel argues, suggests that we automatically process and integrate events that take three seconds or less as chunks of “now”), others just don’t, White points out.</p>
<p>Pöppel, and a surprising number of others, have also argued that human behaviours are structured in roughly three-second units. Wiping or rubbing something, pouring liquid from one pot to another, or reading a line of poetry, for example have been claimed to take approximately three seconds. Again, this is taken as evidence that our brains deal in three-second windows of time, with anything that happens within that time frame being viewed as a single event. (An <a href="http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs10164-010-0260-y">analysis of footage</a> of athletes and coaches embracing at the Beijing Olympics even found that embraces tended to last an average of 3.17 seconds.)</p>
<p>But there’s a significant methodological problem with at least some of the research, agues White: “How is a behavioural unit identified?” White cites research finding that when lay volunteers are shown videos or animations of human behaviour – such as an actor using a keyboard or chasing someone – and are asked to break these behaviours down into the smallest units that seem natural, their segments generally last a lot longer than three seconds.</p>
<p>In fact, White argues, while the idea of a three second subjective present is “simple and eye-catching, which probably contributes to its popularity”, it’s not accurate. There is, instead, he argues, an “envelope of integration” – a flexible period of time in which the brain incorporates data into an overall representation “that has no fixed time limit, but in any case extends well beyond the three second mark.”</p>

<p>Submitting papers to preprint servers (<a href="http://biorxiv.org/">bioRxiv</a>) is finally getting popular in biology. Unfortunately, many of these papers are formatted in a way that is very inconvenient to read, possibly because authors stick to the format asked by journals. Here are 10 simple rules to format your preprints:</p>
<ol>
<li>Format your preprint in the way you would like to read it. The next rules simply implement this first rule.</li>
<li>Use single spacing. No one is going to write between the lines.</li>
<li>Insert figures and their captions in the text, at the relevant place. It is really annoying when you have to continuously go back and forth between the text and the last pages. Putting figures at the end of the paper and captions yet at another place should be punished.</li>
<li>Don’t forget the supplementary material.</li>
<li>We don’t really need 10 rules. In fact the first rule is just fine.</li>

<p>
 Induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) technology has enormous potential to provide improved cellular models of human disease. However, variable genetic and phenotypic characterisation of many existing iPSC lines limits their potential use for research and therapy. Here, we describe the systematic generation, genotyping and phenotyping of 711 iPSC lines derived from 301 healthy individuals by the Human Induced Pluripotent Stem Cells Initiative (HipSci: http://www.hipsci.org). Our study outlines the major sources of genetic and phenotypic variation in iPSCs and establishes their suitability as models of complex human traits and cancer. Through genome-wide profiling we find that 5-46% of the variation in different iPSC phenotypes, including differentiation capacity and cellular morphology, arises from differences between individuals. Additionally, we assess the phenotypic consequences of rare, genomic copy number mutations that are repeatedly observed in iPSC reprogramming and present a comprehensive map of common regulatory variants affecting the transcriptome of human pluripotent cells.

<p>
 High-resolution serial-section electron microscopy (ssEM) makes it possible to investigate the dense meshwork of axons, dendrites, and synapses that form neuronal circuits. However, the imaging scale required to comprehensively reconstruct these structures is more than ten orders of magnitude smaller than the spatial extents occupied by networks of interconnected neurons, some of which span nearly the entire brain. Difficulties in generating and handling data for large volumes at nanoscale resolution have thus restricted vertebrate studies to fragments of circuits. These efforts were recently transformed by advances in computing, sample handling, and imaging techniques, but high-resolution examination of entire brains remains a challenge. Here, we present ssEM data for the complete brain of a larval zebrafish (Danio rerio) at 5.5 days post-fertilization. Our approach utilizes multiple rounds of targeted imaging at different scales to reduce acquisition time and data management requirements. The resulting dataset can be analysed to reconstruct neuronal processes, permitting us to survey all myelinated axons (the projectome). These reconstructions enable precise investigations of neuronal morphology, which reveal remarkable bilateral symmetry in myelinated reticulospinal and lateral line afferent axons. We further set the stage for whole-brain structure–function comparisons by co-registering functional reference atlases and in vivo two-photon fluorescence microscopy data from the same specimen. All obtained images and reconstructions are provided as an open-access resource.

                <h4><a href="http://feeds.nature.com/~r/NatureBiologicalSciencesResearch/~3/N_vRyW5PwlM/nature22344">TRAF2 and OTUD7B govern a ubiquitin-dependent switch that regulates mTORC2
            signalling</a></h4>

<p>
             The mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) has a key role in the integration of
                various physiological stimuli to regulate several cell growth and metabolic
                    pathways. mTOR primarily functions as a catalytic subunit in two
                structurally related but functionally distinct multi-component kinase complexes,
                mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1) and mTORC2 (refs 1, 2). Dysregulation of mTOR signalling is associated with a
                variety of human diseases, including metabolic disorders and cancer.
                Thus, both mTORC1 and mTORC2 kinase activity is tightly controlled in cells. mTORC1
                is activated by both nutrients and growth factors, whereas mTORC2 responds primarily to extracellular cues such as
                growth-factor-triggered activation of PI3K signalling.
                Although both mTOR and GβL (also known as MLST8) assemble into mTORC1
                and mTORC2 (refs 11, 12,
                    13, 14, 15), it remains largely unclear what drives the dynamic
                assembly of these two functionally distinct complexes. Here we show, in humans
                and mice, that the K63-linked polyubiquitination status of GβL dictates
                the homeostasis of mTORC2 formation and activation. Mechanistically, the TRAF2 E3
                ubiquitin ligase promotes K63-linked polyubiquitination of GβL, which
                disrupts its interaction with the unique mTORC2 component SIN1 (refs 12, 13, 14) to favour mTORC1 formation. By contrast, the OTUD7B
                deubiquitinase removes polyubiquitin chains from GβL to promote
                GβL interaction with SIN1, facilitating mTORC2 formation in response to
                various growth signals. Moreover, loss of critical ubiquitination residues in
                GβL, by either K305R/K313R mutations or a melanoma-associated
                GβL(ΔW297) truncation, leads to elevated mTORC2 formation,
                which facilitates tumorigenesis, in part by activating AKT oncogenic signalling. In
                support of a physiologically pivotal role for OTUD7B in the activation of mTORC2/AKT
                signalling, genetic deletion of Otud7b in mice suppresses Akt activation and
                    Kras-driven lung tumorigenesis in vivo. Collectively, our study
                reveals a GβL-ubiquitination-dependent switch that fine-tunes the
                dynamic organization and activation of the mTORC2 kinase under both physiological
                and pathological conditions.

                <h4><a href="http://feeds.nature.com/~r/NatureBiologicalSciencesResearch/~3/ilgxOAQor0E/nature22339">Multi-phase volcanic resurfacing at Loki Patera on Io</a></h4>

<p>
 The Jovian moon Io hosts the most powerful persistently active volcano in the Solar System, Loki Patera. The interior of this volcanic, caldera-like feature is composed of a warm, dark floor covering 21,500 square kilometres surrounding a much cooler central ‘island’. The temperature gradient seen across areas of the patera indicates a systematic resurfacing process, which has been seen to occur typically every one to three years since the 1980s. Analysis of past data has indicated that the resurfacing progressed around the patera in an anti-clockwise direction at a rate of one to two kilometres per day, and that it is caused either by episodic eruptions that emplace voluminous lava flows or by a cyclically overturning lava lake contained within the patera. However, spacecraft and telescope observations have been unable to map the emission from the entire patera floor at sufficient spatial resolution to establish the physical processes at play. Here we report temperature and lava cooling age maps of the entire patera floor at a spatial sampling of about two kilometres, derived from ground-based interferometric imaging of thermal emission from Loki Patera obtained on 8 March 2015 ut as the limb of Europa occulted Io. Our results indicate that Loki Patera is resurfaced by a multi-phase process in which two waves propagate and converge around the central island. The different velocities and start times of the waves indicate a non-uniformity in the lava gas content and/or crust bulk density across the patera.

<p>
             The heterogeneity of cellular states in cancer has been linked to drug resistance,
                cancer progression and the presence of cancer cells with properties of normal tissue
                stem cells. Secreted Wnt signals maintain stem cells in various
                epithelial tissues, including in lung development and regeneration. Here we show that mouse and human lung adenocarcinomas display
                hierarchical features with two distinct subpopulations, one with high Wnt signalling
                activity and another forming a niche that provides the Wnt ligand. The Wnt responder
                cells showed increased tumour propagation ability, suggesting that these cells have
                features of normal tissue stem cells. Genetic perturbation of Wnt production or
                signalling suppressed tumour progression. Small-molecule inhibitors targeting
                essential posttranslational modification of Wnt reduced tumour growth and markedly
                decreased the proliferative potential of lung cancer cells, leading to improved
                survival of tumour-bearing mice. These results indicate that strategies for
                disrupting pathways that maintain stem-like and niche cell phenotypes can translate
                into effective anti-cancer therapies.

<p>
 Animals partition their daily activity rhythms through their internal circadian clocks, which are synchronized by oscillating day–night cycles of light. The fruitfly Drosophila melanogaster senses day–night cycles in part through rhodopsin-dependent light reception in the compound eye and photoreceptor cells in the Hofbauer–Buchner eyelet. A more noteworthy light entrainment pathway is mediated by central pacemaker neurons in the brain. The Drosophila circadian clock is extremely sensitive to light. However, the only known light sensor in pacemaker neurons, the flavoprotein cryptochrome (Cry), responds only to high levels of light in vitro. These observations indicate that there is an additional light-sensing pathway in fly pacemaker neurons. Here we describe a previously uncharacterized rhodopsin, Rh7, which contributes to circadian light entrainment by circadian pacemaker neurons in the brain. The pacemaker neurons respond to violet light, and this response depends on Rh7. Loss of either cry or rh7 caused minor defects in photoentrainment, whereas loss of both caused profound impairment. The circadian photoresponse to constant light was impaired in rh7 mutant flies, especially under dim light. The demonstration that Rh7 functions in circadian pacemaker neurons represents, to our knowledge, the first role for an opsin in the central brain.

                <h4><a href="http://feeds.nature.com/~r/NatureBiologicalSciencesResearch/~3/xSI9B0Tt1C0/nature22323">Intratumoural heterogeneity generated by Notch signalling promotes small-cell lung cancer</a></h4>

<p>
 The Notch signalling pathway mediates cell fate decisions and is tumour suppressive or oncogenic depending on the context. During lung development, Notch pathway activation inhibits the differentiation of precursor cells to a neuroendocrine fate. In small-cell lung cancer, an aggressive neuroendocrine lung cancer, loss-of-function mutations in NOTCH genes and the inhibitory effects of ectopic Notch activation indicate that Notch signalling is tumour suppressive. Here we show that Notch signalling can be both tumour suppressive and pro-tumorigenic in small-cell lung cancer. Endogenous activation of the Notch pathway results in a neuroendocrine to non-neuroendocrine fate switch in 10–50% of tumour cells in a mouse model of small-cell lung cancer and in human tumours. This switch is mediated in part by Rest (also known as Nrsf), a transcriptional repressor that inhibits neuroendocrine gene expression. Non-neuroendocrine Notch-active small-cell lung cancer cells are slow growing, consistent with a tumour-suppressive role for Notch, but these cells are also relatively chemoresistant and provide trophic support to neuroendocrine tumour cells, consistent with a pro-tumorigenic role. Importantly, Notch blockade in combination with chemotherapy suppresses tumour growth and delays relapse in pre-clinical models. Thus, small-cell lung cancer tumours generate their own microenvironment via activation of Notch signalling in a subset of tumour cells, and the presence of these cells may serve as a biomarker for the use of Notch pathway inhibitors in combination with chemotherapy in select patients with small-cell lung cancer.

<p>
 Most small molecules are unable to rapidly traverse the outer membrane of Gram-negative bacteria and accumulate inside these cells, making the discovery of much-needed drugs against these pathogens challenging. Current understanding of the physicochemical properties that dictate small-molecule accumulation in Gram-negative bacteria is largely based on retrospective analyses of antibacterial agents, which suggest that polarity and molecular weight are key factors. Here we assess the ability of over 180 diverse compounds to accumulate in Escherichia coli. Computational analysis of the results reveals major differences from the retrospective studies, namely that the small molecules that are most likely to accumulate contain an amine, are amphiphilic and rigid, and have low globularity. These guidelines were then applied to convert deoxynybomycin, a natural product that is active only against Gram-positive organisms, into an antibiotic with activity against a diverse panel of multi-drug-resistant Gram-negative pathogens. We anticipate that these findings will aid in the discovery and development of antibiotics against Gram-negative bacteria.

<p>
             Nutrient signalling integrates and coordinates gene expression, metabolism and
                growth. However, its primary molecular mechanisms remain incompletely understood in
                plants and animals. Here we report unique Ca2+ signalling triggered
                by nitrate with live imaging of an ultrasensitive biosensor in Arabidopsis
                leaves and roots. A nitrate-sensitized and targeted functional genomic screen
                identifies subgroup III Ca2+-sensor protein kinases (CPKs) as master
                regulators that orchestrate primary nitrate responses. A chemical switch with the
                engineered mutant CPK10(M141G) circumvents embryo lethality and enables conditional
                analyses of cpk10 cpk30 cpk32 triple mutants to define comprehensive
                nitrate-associated regulatory and developmental programs. Nitrate-coupled CPK
                signalling phosphorylates conserved NIN-LIKE PROTEIN (NLP) transcription factors to
                specify the reprogramming of gene sets for downstream transcription factors,
                transporters, nitrogen assimilation, carbon/nitrogen metabolism, redox, signalling,
                hormones and proliferation. Conditional cpk10 cpk30 cpk32 and nlp7
                mutants similarly impair nitrate-stimulated system-wide shoot growth and root
                establishment. The nutrient-coupled Ca2+ signalling network
                integrates transcriptome and cellular metabolism with shoot–root
                coordination and developmental plasticity in shaping organ biomass and
                architecture.

<p>
 Cerebral cavernous malformations (CCMs) are a cause of stroke and seizure for which no effective medical therapies yet exist. CCMs arise from the loss of an adaptor complex that negatively regulates MEKK3–KLF2/4 signalling in brain endothelial cells, but upstream activators of this disease pathway have yet to be identified. Here we identify endothelial Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) and the gut microbiome as critical stimulants of CCM formation. Activation of TLR4 by Gram-negative bacteria or lipopolysaccharide accelerates CCM formation, and genetic or pharmacologic blockade of TLR4 signalling prevents CCM formation in mice. Polymorphisms that increase expression of the TLR4 gene or the gene encoding its co-receptor CD14 are associated with higher CCM lesion burden in humans. Germ-free mice are protected from CCM formation, and a single course of antibiotics permanently alters CCM susceptibility in mice. These studies identify unexpected roles for the microbiome and innate immune signalling in the pathogenesis of a cerebrovascular disease, as well as strategies for its treatment.

<p>
 The selective coupling of G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) to specific G proteins is critical to trigger the appropriate physiological response. However, the determinants of selective binding have remained elusive. Here we reveal the existence of a selectivity barcode (that is, patterns of amino acids) on each of the 16 human G proteins that is recognized by distinct regions on the approximately 800 human receptors. Although universally conserved positions in the barcode allow the receptors to bind and activate G proteins in a similar manner, different receptors recognize the unique positions of the G-protein barcode through distinct residues, like multiple keys (receptors) opening the same lock (G protein) using non-identical cuts. Considering the evolutionary history of GPCRs allows the identification of these selectivity-determining residues. These findings lay the foundation for understanding the molecular basis of coupling selectivity within individual receptors and G proteins.

                <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/~r/plos/blogs/neuro/~3/IF3_wBIsYlc/">Q&amp;A with Greg Dunn, neuroscientist turned artist</a></h4>

<img alt="" class="webfeedsFeaturedVisual wp-post-image" height="150" src="http://blogs.plos.org/neuro/files/2017/05/Basket-and-Pyramidals-small-150x150.jpg" style="display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;" width="150" /><p style="text-align: left;">For most neuroscientists, long days in the lab pipetting or recording from cells doesn’t inspire one to pick up a paintbrush or sketchpad. But for others, the still-mysterious—and often breathtakingly beautiful—workings of the brain are a source of awe. One such individual is neuroscientist-turned-artist <a href="http://www.gregadunn.com" target="_blank">Greg Dunn</a>. As a graduate student at the University of Pennsylvania, his own research merged with experimental forays into painting, adapting neural forms to the principles of Asian art. Greg joins us to discuss his personal journey to becoming a science artist, his visions for the burgeoning field of science-inspired art, and his advice for aspiring brain-loving artists.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>You followed a unique career path compared to most scientists. Could you share a bit about your transition from scientist to artist and what inspired you to pursue this path?</strong></p>
<p><strong>GD</strong>: I had always needed an artistic outlet in my life, and that became more true than ever when working on very complex biological systems in the lab. When experiments don’t work after a massive expenditure in your efforts, its nice to have something going in parallel that produces something tangible, such as art. I’ve always loved Asian art and the neuroscience images I saw every day in grad school began to merge with that interest, and over the course of several months in my first year of grad school I began to develop my aesthetic in earnest.</p>
<p>I never felt that I was doing anything at the lab bench that others couldn’t have, but I do feel like I have a useful voice in combining science and art. I hope that my career trajectory serves as an example that specialized scientific knowledge can be applied to many different fields and can help to refine a person’s individual voice.</p>
<p><strong>Art based on science (including neuroscience) is becoming increasingly popular. Why do you suspect this field is so appealing, even to non-scientists?</strong></p>
<p><strong>GD</strong>: The brain is the ultimate frontier, it is more fundamentally US than anything else we possess. It is at the fundamental root of everything we could possibly be interested in or do with our lives. It is similar to why astronomy is popular to the lay public in this sense, it holds such great philosophical mysteries to explore. And on top of its conceptual and metaphorical meaning, it is aesthetically beautiful. It is so rich in possibility that it is the sort of thing a person can comfortably spend their whole life exploring.</p>
<p><strong>How, if at all, do you believe that neuroscience-inspired art can serve as an effective outreach tool? Have you witnessed this with your own work?</strong></p>
<p><strong>GD</strong>: Yes. Art harnesses the power of emotions and direct perceptions in a way that hard data and dry explanations can’t. I deliberately use the power of composition and design to try and make my works appealing on an instinctive level. With the world at our fingertips, people need to be given a reason to care about what they are looking at. Making compelling paintings is about drawing the viewer in initially and then giving them something to chew on in the long term, in this case pondering the nature of the brain and mind.</p>
<p>In the case of <a href="http://www.gregadunn.com/self-reflected/" target="_blank">Self Reflected</a>, my latest work done in collaboration with Dr. Brian Edwards, the point was to demonstrate directly what complexity looks like. Telling somebody that the brain has 86 billion neurons is essentially meaningless because we have no ability to grasp what that number means. Showing somebody directly what the activity of 500,000 neurons looks like at once in a huge, wall sized microetching gives a person a stepping stone to begin to comprehend this astonishing fact. When you then tell them that the brain is actually hundreds of millions of times MORE complicated than that, that’s when a light goes on.</p>

<p><strong>How do you select the subject matter for your work? Do you have any favorite pieces that were particularly meaningful, or that you’re especially proud of?</strong></p>
<p><strong>GD</strong>: I’m attracted by a variety of compelling images and subjects in neuroscience and meditation. I try to choose subjects that are of interest to different categories of people- some are more specialized neuro, others more general, some more abstract, etc. I’d say that some of my favorites are Basket and Pyramidals as I think it is a clear statement about how neurons fit in the fractal like organization of nature and how they are similar in form to trees, branches, etc that have been painted in gold leaf in Asia for centuries. Cortex in Metallic Pastels also turned out very well and is one of the first examples of my deep reflective gold leaf technique. And, of course, Self Reflected is the most ambitious project of any kind I’d ever attempted. Its scope and attention to detail I think will make it a useful visualization of the brain for a very long time.</p>

<p><strong>The overlapping fields of art and neuroscience are evolving rapidly. How to do you see the field changing over the next decade?</strong></p>
<p><strong>GD</strong>: Representing brain aesthetics is only one part of it. There is a lot of art/sci work going on in using EEG signals or other neurofeedback devices to direct tasks of various sorts. I am looking forward to seeing some of the work that will come out of collecting unconscious brain activity data that will direct image generation software. I personally plan to try to elucidate states of consciousness that arise in deeper states of meditation through art, as this is more of a subjectively and experientially directed bit of neuroscience art. I think that it is important that art poke our brains into different types of perceptions to teach us a bit more about how it works.</p>
<p><strong>Do you have any advice for others hoping to pursue a career in science-inspired art?</strong></p>
<p><strong>GD</strong>: Find your own unique voice! Make a Venn diagram of what your passions are and think hard about how and where they intersect. That is where you will be more effective, motivated, and unique. Really strive to make something categorically new. Don’t always trust your first idea on how to do something, give yourself the time to really iterate an idea in your mind before you realize it. If you are trying to make a living at it, be smart about how to balance your passion with financial realities. Overall, work to convince the world that the barriers between science and art are indistinct at best, and that multifaceted approaches to problems are the most effective solutions.</p>

<p>They say that if you can laugh at it, you can live with it. Is this true? Does the ability to see the funny side of things really act like a psychological shield against stress? <a href="http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/0146167217699583">A series of new studies</a> in <em>Personality and Social Psychological Bulletin</em> provides some tentative support for the idea. But the research also illustrates why this is such a difficult topic to study – does humour really reduce stress or is it just easier to see the funny side when you are coping well? And it’s worth remembering the serious risk that if humour is shown to be protective by psychology research – and it’s a big <em>if</em> – that those who suffer most from stress will be put under social pressure to help themselves by cheering up, a situation only likely to intensify their distress.</p>
<p><span id="more-23667"></span></p>
<p>Heidi Fritz at Clarkson University and her colleagues began by conducting a diary study with 21 women and 1 man diagnosed with the chronic pain condition Fibromyalgia Syndrome. The participants first completed baseline questionnaires about their physical health, psychological state, their tendency to see the funny side of things (for example, they were asked whether they would typically experience mirth in situations such as a waiter spilling a drink over them), how much socialising and support they’d had with friends and relatives recently, and how much they tended to reappraise challenges, such as looking for the positives in a difficult situation. Then the participants spent the next four days completing diary entries several times each day about their physical and emotional state.</p>
<p>The more pronounced the participants’ sense of humour, the lower their psychological distress at the start of the study and the better their physical symptoms through the diary stage. But against the researchers’ expectations, the apparent benefits of humour weren’t explained by sense of humour being linked with a tendency to reappraise situations, nor to better social relations.</p>
<p>A second study involved just over 100 undergrad students answering questions about their psychological and emotional state, their tendency to find things funny and make jokes, and they also recalled a previous distressing event and how much it continued to affect them.</p>
<p>Overall, the more that the students said the past trauma continued to affect them, the higher they scored for signs of psychological distress. But crucially this wasn’t the case for the students who were most inclined to humour and seeing the funny side of things – they said the trauma was still affecting their lives, but based on their emotional scores, they weren’t experiencing heightened distress.</p>
<p>The obvious problem with these first two studies is that it might simply be that the less distressed participants were better able to experience humour, rather than their inclination for humour reducing their stress levels or, in the case of the first study, their physical symptoms.</p>
<p>A final study attempted to overcome this methodological problem and involved students affected by the September 11 terror attacks in New York.  The students completed baseline psychological measures one month after the attacks, including scoring their disposition for humour (and their humour style), and then two months later, they answered more questions about their levels of psychological distress.</p>
<p>The researchers said there was a tendency for self-enhancing humour (taking a cheerful perspective on life) to be associated with reduced stress over time – though direct evidence for this did not reach statistical significance in their analysis – and that this was related to a greater inclination to reappraise situations – finding the positives where possible. In contrast, self-defeating humour (disparaging oneself) was associated with more distress and less reappraisal.</p>
<p>Fritz and her colleagues said a consistent pattern had emerged from their studies: “positive humour use predicted reduced psychological distress in response to stressful events”. However, the evidence for this conclusion seems weak: only the final study had the longitudinal methodology needed to identify a potential causal role for humour in reducing distress, and in fact it failed, statistically, to establish that a stronger inclination for humour at baseline was directly associated with less distress at follow-up (and even if it had, it’s still possible that another unknown variable(s) – such as personality – was the true causal factor behind more humour and less distress. Stronger evidence for humour’s stress-busting benefit would require an experiment that manipulated people’s sense of humour and looked at the effects on stress – clearly a tricky thing to do).</p>
<p>“Given the persistent lay belief in the physical health benefits of humour use, it is critical that we understand the magnitude of its effect,” the researchers concluded. Far more robust research is needed before we reach that point.</p>

                <h4><a href="http://brainblogger.com/2017/05/08/hiv-medications-linked-to-increase-in-alzheimers-disease-protein/">HIV Medications Linked to Increase in Alzheimer’s Disease Protein</a></h4>

<p>A class of drugs called protease inhibitors have been lifesaving for people with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). However, these medications come with a long list of side effects that may include impairments in cognitive function. How protease inhibitors might cause cognitive side effects has remained a mystery for some time. New research from the University of Pennsylvania is beginning to shed light on the answer, and it lies in a protein that is one of the main components of Alzheimer’s disease.</p>
<p>Protease inhibitors work to treat HIV by preventing replication of the HIV virus. The drugs block an enzyme called HIV protease, which cleaves the protein precursors required to produce new viral particles. Inhibiting HIV protease thus prevents the spread of the virus throughout the body. Since the approval of these drugs for clinical use in 1995, the rate of deaths from HIV has declined drastically. A typical HIV patient takes a combination of protease inhibitors and other medications to counter the development of drug-resistant HIV strains.</p>
<p>Side effects caused by protease inhibitors are common. These include dyslipidemia, hypercholesterolemia, metabolic syndrome, and, potentially, cognitive dysfunction. HIV-associated cognitive disorders, abbreviated HAND, include a spectrum of symptoms such as forgetfulness, confusion, and behavioral and motor changes. While the HIV virus itself is believed to play a role in causing HAND symptoms, the drugs used to treat the virus, including protease inhibitors, have also been implicated in the development of HAND. Until now, little was known about how protease inhibitors might cause cognitive side effects, and therefore, how such symptoms might be prevented.</p>
<p>Recent research from the University of Pennsylvania has shed new light on the mechanism by which protease inhibitors might impair cognitive function. Work by Kelly Jordan-Sciutto and colleagues in the Department of Pathology at the University of Pennsylvania has demonstrated that protease inhibitors increase levels of the peptide beta amyloid in the brain. Excessive levels of beta amyloid can impair the way brain cells function.</p>
<p>Beta amyloid protein is commonly known for playing a major role in Alzeheimer’s disease and several other neurological diseases, including Lewy body dementia, inclusion body myositis, and cerebral amyloid angiopathy. In Alzheimer’s disease, beta amyloid forms plaques or clumps of protein that give rise to deposits outside of brain cells, causing impairments in cell function. Increased levels of beta amyloid and its precursor protein – amyloid precursor protein (APP) – have also been observed in the brains of HIV-infected patients.</p>
<p>Jordan-Sciutto’s team had previously found that HIV drugs such as protease inhibitors can be toxic to neurons. They showed that some of these toxic effects were caused by damage to the DNA of the cell’s energy-generating cells, called mitochondria, which are located in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). ER stress is known to activate the cell’s unfolded protein response (UPR) that increase the level of a protein called BACE1. In turn, BACE1 increases levels of beta amyloid by cleaving its precursor protein, APP.</p>
<p>Jordan-Sciutto theorized that because protease inhibitors cause ER stress, they might also increase beta amyloid by activating the UPR, and thus BACE1 and APP downstream. Their most recent study, published in the <em>American Journal of Pathology</em>, explored these questions further by examining whether protease inhibitors change the levels of beta amyloid and other cellular proteins that regulate its production.</p>
<p>To explore this question, a group of macaques were infected with the form of HIV found in monkeys, called simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV). Monkeys were then treated with either a cocktail of protease inhibitors or a placebo. The brains of the monkeys were examined 160 days following infection.</p>
<p>The results of the experiments showed that SIV-infected monkeys treated with protease inhibitors had much higher levels of beta amyloid in their neurons than infected monkeys who did not receive the drug. Infected drug-treated monkeys also showed increased levels of the amyloid beta precursor protein. As Jordan-Sciutto predicted, these monkeys also had increased levels of BACE1.</p>
<p>Interestingly, 90% of the placebo-treated animals developed signs of neurological dysfunction by 12 weeks of treatment, whereas the animals treated with the drug cocktail did not display any of these symptoms. This raises the question of whether the observed increases in amyloid beta protein in the drug-treated animals are pathological; that is, whether this amount of beta amyloid can cause symptoms. To date, the researchers have not studied monkeys treated with protease inhibitors in the absence of SIV infection in order to assess the effects of the drug alone.</p>
<p>To partly address this problem, the researchers also studied the effect of protease inhibitors on the unfolded protein response (UPR) in cultured cells derived from rat glial cells and human fetal tissue. Protease inhibitors increased the expression of markers associated with UPR activation and increased BACE1 in the cultured cells, which led to an increase in the cleavage of APP and subsequent cell damage. Conversely, treatment with a drug that inhibited BACE1 prevented this cell damage. Finally, the researchers showed that another enzyme, called PERK, was also a key player in the unfolded protein response that led to the increase in BACE1 levels.</p>
<p>These novel findings provide a clear mechanism for protease inhibitor brain toxicity in patients with HIV, suggesting that these drugs may in fact contribute to the development of HIV-associated cognitive disorders by increasing beta amyloid. Despite these neurotoxic effects, protease inhibitors will remain a mainstay for the treatment of HIV, as they have profoundly improved the quality of life and extended the lifespan of patients. The results of these studies suggest that potential new therapies targeting the proteins BACE1 and PERK could prevent the cognitive side effects of protease inhibitors.</p>

<p><em>By </em><a href="http://www.psychologywriter.org.uk/">Christian Jarrett</a></p>
<p>There are some common-sense reasons for thinking that being raised without siblings will have meaningful psychological consequences – after all, “only children” are likely to get more attention from their parents than kids with sibs, but at the same time they miss out on the social experience that comes from sharing, playing and competing with brothers or sisters.</p>
<p>The latest study to look into this, <a href="http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11682-016-9530-9?wt_mc=alerts.TOCjournals">published recently</a> in <em>Brain Imaging and Behavior</em>, comes from China where the government’s one-child family planning programme has led to a huge increase in the numbers of only children. Junyi Yang and his colleagues scanned the brains of hundreds university students, about half of whom were only children and also tested their personality, creativity and intelligence. The only children outperformed the participants with siblings on creativity, but they scored lower on trait agreeableness – psychological differences that appeared to coincide with relevant structural differences in their brains.</p>
<p><span id="more-23583"></span></p>
<p>The test of creativity – the verbal part of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torrance_Tests_of_Creative_Thinking">the Torrance Test</a> – was fairly comprehensive and involved the participants doing things like coming up with unusual uses for cardboard boxes, improving a toy elephant and thinking about the consequences of an imaginary scenario. Personality was assessed using a fairly standard self-report questionnaire. And the brain imaging scan was used to look for group differences in grey matter volume in specific brain areas that the researchers thought might be relevant based on past research.</p>
<p>The only children’s superior performance on the creativity tasks tied in with their having more grey matter, on average, in the supramarginal gyrus of their brains than the participants with siblings (even after factoring out group differences in family income and parents’ education). This is a region in the parietal lobe that Yang and his team said has previously linked with mental flexibility and imagination; also in this study, across all participants, grey matter volume in this brain region correlated with creativity scores. The researchers speculated only children’s apparent superior creativity may be related to the greater contact they’d had with their parents, and perhaps their parents’ having heightened expectations for them.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the only children also scored lower on agreeableness – a trait that’s associated with warmth and concern for others. This seemed to tie in with their having less grey matter in the medial prefrontal cortex (and across the sample, more grey matter here correlated with trait agreeability) – a region at the front of the brain that’s known to be involved in thinking about the self in relation to others. The researchers speculated this could be explained by only children receiving excessive attention and praise from parents and other family members, and having a lack of social practice with siblings.</p>
<p>It’s always interesting when data comes in that speaks to some of our folk assumptions about human psychology – in this case, how the kind of upbringing we have shapes the kind of people we become. But it’s worth treating these new findings with some caution, especially given the recent, rigorous studies that have suggested birth order is not linked to personality.</p>
<p>Apart from the snapshot nature of the new findings, with measures only taken at one time point, and the lack of diversity in the current sample – highly educated young people in China – being an only child is also heavily confounded with other factors like parents’ social and educational background and genes inherited from parents (although the researchers made some effort to account for some of this). Also, it’s always risky trying to interpret the meaning of structural brain differences. Still, the new results give us something to work with and could help direct the course of future research on the topic.</p>

A paper just published in Nature Human Behaviour makes some big claims about the brain. It's called Evidence for a large-scale brain system supporting allostasis and interoception in humans, but how much is evidence and how much is speculation?



The authors, Ian R. Kleckner and colleagues of Northeastern University, argue that a core function of the brain is allostasis, which they define as the process by which the brain "efficiently maintains energy regulation in the body". Allostasis ent

One of the overarching messages was that the use and re-use of healthcare data could revolutionize the understanding of human health and disease with the phrase ‘data saves lives’ prominent throughout the conference.</p>
<p><strong>Gaining the public’s trust and developing the informatics workforce</strong></p>
<p>Many of the sessions were focused on the work that is being carried out in the UK, specifically the North of England, which has become a hub for informatics research with projects such as <a href="https://www.connectedhealthcities.org/">Connected Health Cities</a> headed up by <a href="https://www.research.manchester.ac.uk/portal/en/researchers/john-ainsworth(9ad38019-9856-4c5d-acea-2614976f8d74).html">John Ainsworth</a>. In a panel session, he described the main aims of the project which center on the use of information technology to improve health services for patients in Northern England. Another key aim of the project is to establish the public’s trust which will allow researchers to use their data. In his talk during one of the early panel sessions, <a href="https://www.research.manchester.ac.uk/portal/Buchan.html">Iain Buchan</a> also highlighted the importance of obtaining trust from participants. Such trust is often won by demonstrating how the results of the research will be of benefit to the patient population, and as such tends to be easier to obtain from a smaller community of patients who will be able to see the direct benefit of the research to their community.</p>
<p>A number of sessions and talks also highlighted the importance of the workforce, made up of those working in both discovery science and the healthcare setting. <a href="https://www.nuffieldtrust.org.uk/person/dr-martin-bardsley">Martin Bardsley</a> spoke about the need to ensure that we have enough informatics experts and analysts who can handle and analyze healthcare data. Once the research is being put into practice it’s also imperative that the workforce on the front-line of healthcare is on-board with the implementation of the research.</p>
<p><strong>The use of informatics in healthcare: from patients to research and back again</strong></p>
<p>A recurring theme at the conference centered around a circular model that has been proposed in a recent article in the <a href="https://academic.oup.com/jamia/article/23/4/791/2198415/An-informatics-research-agenda-to-support"><em>Journal of the American Medical Informatics Association</em></a> which summarizes how informatics can and should be used in medicine. The model puts the patient at the start and the end of the circle; with data collected during their care being used in research leading to the generation of new knowledge which is then fed back into the system leading to changes in healthcare policy, thereby improving the care that the patient experiences. In the first of the plenary talks, <a href="http://www.labmedinfo.org/people/bellazzi">Riccardo Bellazi</a> of the University of Pavia, discussed one of the key considerations in this circle; the variety observed in biomedical big data and how this can be harnessed in translational and clinical research as well as in the care of patients. This large variety comes from the sheer quantity of data that is now being collected and methods are required to deal with data on this scale at every stage, including data storage, integration and analysis.</p>

<p>In another of the plenary talks, <a href="http://www.cs.vu.nl/~frank.van.harmelen/">Frank van Harmelen</a> of Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam spoke about how linked data can improve healthcare systems. There has been steady progress in the linking of data-sets on the web to create data networks that contain billions of facts and rules that can be used to find information very quickly. Despite these advances, such systems are not so common in the healthcare setting. Professor van Harmelen presented some ways that these data networks could be used in healthcare, for example in the organization of data on FDA approved drugs including side effects and adverse reactions. From his presentation, it’s clear that there is some way to go before these ideas can be harnessed fully in the healthcare setting and there is real scope for improvement in the flow and organization of health information.</p>
<p>Another of the keynote talks was given by <a href="https://www.ucl.ac.uk/health-psychology/people/Susan_Michie">Susan Michie</a> of University College London who presented her work on the Human Behavior-Change Project, which aims to develop methods for systematically analysing human behavior and how this can affect health. This project is an example of the potential power of information technology in medical research as it will build an Artificial Intelligence system to analyze the global literature and extract information on human behavior in order to generate evidence that will then inform researchers, policy makers and clinicians.</p>

<p>The final keynote speaker, <a href="https://www.patientslikeme.com/members/view/18944">Sally Okun</a>, rounded off the conference with a talk focusing on health technology from the patient perspective. She is Vice President for Advocacy, Policy and Patient Safety at PatientsLikeMe, an online patient centered research network. The network currently has around half a million users and stores information on each individual in a similar way to an electronic health record. One of the future aims of the network is to provide a ‘digital avatar’ for each patient which can be used for decision making, for example for selecting treatment options, by considering all of the information that is stored on that person. It was fitting to end the conference with a talk focusing on how patients can directly benefit from the use of information technology, which is the ultimate driving force for the research being carried out in the medical informatics field.</p>

<img alt="" class="attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image" height="110" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2017/05/SpencerFox-140x110.jpg" style="display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;" width="140" /><p>Spring rains and rising temperatures came early this year, signaling the start of mosquito season and the threat of new Zika outbreaks in the United States. Imagine that you are a public health official in Houston, Texas. You know that parts of the city may be vulnerable to Zika spread and that at least 81 people have arrived in the metropolitan area infected with Zika since 2015. The challenge is that most Zika infections are asymptomatic and therefore not diagnosed by doctors or reported to public health agencies.</p>
<blockquote><p>Although most Zika cases are quite mild, a Zika outbreak is cause for serious concern and immediate intervention because of the established link between Zika infection during pregnancy and neurological complications in unborn babies.</p></blockquote>
<p>Zika could spread <em>silently</em> in Houston long before it’s detected. Although most Zika cases are quite mild, a Zika outbreak is cause for serious concern and immediate intervention because of the established link between Zika infection during pregnancy and neurological complications in unborn babies.</p>
<p>You receive notification that a single individual with no travel history to Zika affected regions has tested positive for Zika, signaling that local transmission has occurred. Should you initiate costly interventions, including mosquito control and educational campaigns, or wait for more cases to arise? How would a second case change your decision? Would your response be different if you were a public health official in Lubbock, Texas instead of Houston? Depending on your location, the presence of two cases can reflect an anomalous low probability event or indicate an imminent or ongoing outbreak.</p>
<p>In our recent article: “<a href="https://bmcinfectdis.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12879-017-2394-9">Assessing real-time Zika risk in the United States</a>”, we present a computational model intended to help public health officials navigate such challenges and assess epidemic risks as cases accumulate within their jurisdiction.</p>
<p>Our model considers the two prerequisites for a Zika outbreak: the arrival of infected travelers and the prevalence of <em>Aedes </em>mosquito species capable of transmitting disease to uninfected people. If infected travelers are the “sparks”, then mosquito bites provide the fuel for a full-blown outbreak.</p>
<p>Using Texas as a high risk case study, we find that the Zika importation rate can be predicted from local tourism spending, and that mosquito-borne transmission depends on climatic and socioeconomic conditions, with the highest risks occurring in low GDP, high temperature regions.  By simulating these processes, in conjunction with the unpredictable nature of disease transmission and Zika’s low reporting rate, we found that the 254 counties of Texas vary enormously in risk. Most counties have almost no chance of a Zika outbreak while a few high risk counties have 60-fold greater risk.</p>
<p>So, when and where should public health officials trigger interventions? In 2016, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) prudently recommended a two case threshold and Texas Department of State and Health Services (DSHS) conservatively opted to reduce the threshold to a single reported locally-transmitted case of Zika. Indeed, during the small November 2017 Zika outbreak in Cameron County, Texas DSHS intervened immediately.</p>
<blockquote><p>Our model is designed to help officials determine appropriate intervention triggers, depending on local environmental and socioeconomic conditions.</p></blockquote>
<p>Our model is designed to help officials determine appropriate intervention triggers, depending on local environmental and socioeconomic conditions. High risk regions, like the Houston Metropolitan region and Rio Grande Valley should certainly have early (one or two case) triggers.  However, given economic and societal costs of Zika intervention, lower risk regions like the Dallas or Austin metropolitan areas might consider less stringent thresholds.</p>
<p>As we enter mosquito season in the Southern US, this model can be used readily for public health planning and real-time risk assessments. Zika prevalence across the Americas is considerably lower today than this time last year; during the first 15 weeks of 2016, the weekly prevalence peaked around 40,000 cases per week compared to less than 2,000 cases per week this year.</p>
<p>This has translated into fewer infected travelers arriving in Texas, down from 33 by May of 2016, to only 11 as of May in 2017.   Thus, as we optimistically look towards a mosquito season with fewer Zika ‘sparks’, this framework can provide data-driven insight for anticipating and managing risk in vulnerable regions of the US.</p>

<em>By guest blogger</em> <a href="http://www.ginnysmithscience.com/">Ginny Smith</a></p>
<p>Fifty years ago, in Connecticut, a series of infamous experiments were taking place. The volunteers believed they were involved in an investigation into learning and memory, and that they would be administering shocks to a test subject whenever he answered questions incorrectly. But despite pretences, the scientist behind the research, Stanley Milgram, wasn’t actually interested in learning. The real topic of study? Obedience.</p>
<p>Milgram recorded how far his participants were willing to go when told to deliver larger and larger shocks. In one version of the study, 26 out of 40 participants continued to the highest shock level – two steps beyond the button labelled “Danger: severe shock”.</p>
<p>But this was 50 years ago – surely the same wouldn’t happen if the experiment were conducted today? That’s what a group of researchers from SWPS University of Social Sciences and Humanities in Poland aimed to find out, in a “partial replication” of Milgram <a href="http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/1948550617693060">published recently</a> in <i>Social Psychological and Personality Science</i>.</p>
<p><span id="more-23551"></span></p>
<p>Today’s ethical guidelines meant Dariusz Doliński and his colleagues couldn’t recreate Milgram’s experiment completely. However, they took advantage of the fact that in the original experiments, the 10th shock level seemed especially important, a kind of “point of no return”. The overwhelming majority of the participants who went this far continued to the end of the experiment, administering the 30th and final shock level (labelled XXX), even though there’s evidence some of them believed the shock may have been lethal.</p>
<p>So Doliński and his team used just 10 shock levels, to speed things up and reduce the stress of the task on their 80 participants (aged 18 to 69; attempts were made to exclude those likely to be familiar with the original Milgram research). The researchers assumed that the portion of participants who agreed to administer this 10th shock (labelled 450 volts) would give a good assessment of the proportion who would have been prepared to go all the way in the original version of the research.</p>
<p>Just like Milgram, and other <a href="http://thepsychologist.bps.org.uk/volume-21/edition-9/news-and-media">replication attempts in the US</a> and elsewhere, the team found the majority (90 per cent in this case) of “teachers” were willing to continue to the highest shock level, even after hearing screams of pain from the “learner”. The researchers also went a step further, attempting to find out whether the sex of the “learner” had any effect on the “teacher’s” behaviour. However because so few “teachers” refused to continue to the end, there was too small a sample size to see if disobedience was higher when the ‘learner’ was male or female.</p>
<p>So what does this tell us? First, it suggests that despite the so-called replication crisis currently gripping psychology, there are still some classic findings that are reliable, albeit that there is <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2015/10/13/social-psychology-textbooks-ignore-all-modern-criticisms-of-milgrams-obedience-experiments/">fierce debate</a> over how to interpret participants’ behaviour and <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2011/02/16/milgrams-obedience-studies-not-about-obedience-after-all/">whether it truly reflects obedience or not</a>. Second, it highlights the fact that obedience – if that is what’s on display – is common across cultures. Poland, and other Eastern European countries around it, have experienced huge political changes over the last 80 years, with heavily controlled communism giving way to democratic freedoms. Now, the pendulum is starting to swing again, with the socially conservative “Law and Justice” party winning the 2015 Polish elections and remaining hugely popular. But despite all these changes, and the issues that have come with them, the instinct to submit to authority still seems to be strong.</p>

<p>A disability journal has retracted a paper supposedly penned by a man with severe disabilities, citing duplication. Although the reason for the retraction may sound run-of-the-mill, this situation is far from ordinary.
