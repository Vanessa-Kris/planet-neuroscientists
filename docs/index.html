As the <i>NYT</i>, </span><span lang="EN" style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif; font-size: 12pt;"><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/13/business/media/wyss-tribune-company-buyer.html?utm_source=pocket_mylist"><span lang="EN-GB">put it</span></a></span><span style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif; font-size: 12pt;">, “The Hub Project it is not a stand-alone organisation for tax purposes, but is housed within two Arabella-managed non-profits, New Venture Fund and the </span><span lang="EN" style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif; font-size: 12pt;"><a href="https://www.influencewatch.org/non-profit/sixteen-thirty-fund/"><span lang="EN-GB">Sixteen Thirty Fund</span></a></span><span style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif; font-size: 12pt;">, which pay Hub Project employees.”</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif; font-size: 12pt;">In a second article, <i>NYT</i> </span><span lang="EN" style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif; font-size: 12pt;"><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/05/03/us/politics/hansjorg-wyss-money-democrats.html?"><span lang="EN-GB">noted</span></a></span><span style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif; font-size: 12pt;"> that Arabella Advisors and the organisations it manages operate a funding model that uses so-called </span><span lang="EN" style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif; font-size: 12pt;"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dark_money"><span lang="EN-GB">dark money</span></a></span><span style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif; font-size: 12pt;">. This sees donor money channelled through non-profit organisations like NVF, which in the US are not required to disclose their donors. Arabella’s network, said the <i>NYT</i>, is a leading vehicle for doing this on the left.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif; font-size: 12pt;">As I understand it, this allows funders to donate to a non-profit that then distributes the money to different groups without it being publicly known who the donor was. As part of this process Arabella Advisors provides administrative services to organisations like NVF, much in the way that NVF provides such services to SPARC. Unlike NVF, however, Arabella is a for-profit organisation.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif; font-size: 12pt;">The money channelled through NVF is not insubstantial. “Between 2007 and last year,” the <i>NYT </i></span><span lang="EN" style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif; font-size: 12pt;"><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/13/business/media/wyss-tribune-company-buyer.html?utm_source=pocket_mylist"><span lang="EN-GB">reported</span></a></span><span style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif; font-size: 12pt;">, “the Wyss Foundation donated roughly $56.5 million to New Venture Fund.” (This figure is based on tax returns and </span><span lang="EN" style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif; font-size: 12pt;"><a href="https://www.wyssfoundation.org/grants"><span lang="EN-GB">voluntary disclosures</span></a></span><span style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif; font-size: 12pt;">).</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif; font-size: 12pt;">Neither </span><i style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif; font-size: 12pt;">NYT</i><span style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif; font-size: 12pt;">article mentions SPARC, but it is one of around 150 “projects” that have administrative agreements with NVF. In doing so they become part of a non-profit mother ship that confers non-profit status on them too.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif; font-size: 12pt;">Referred to as fiscal sponsorship this practice has been increasing in popularity in recent years. And it is a model that a number of open access organisations have begun to use.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif; font-size: 12pt;">What is not clear to me is how many OA advocates are aware that OA organisations have started to use fiscal sponsorship and, if they are, whether they fully understand how it works and are comfortable with it.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif; font-size: 12pt;">I confess I had myself barely registered the fact that SPARC had decoupled from ARL. And as I think will be apparent, I do not fully understand how fiscal sponsorship works, or the implications it might have for the OA movement if widely adopted by OA organisations and initiatives. I do, however, have some thoughts on it.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif; font-size: 12pt;">Wikipedia </span><span lang="EN" style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif; font-size: 12pt;"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiscal_sponsorship"><span lang="EN-GB">says</span></a></span><span style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif; font-size: 12pt;"> this of the model: “Fiscal sponsorship refers to the practice of non-profit organisations offering their legal and tax-exempt status to groups – typically projects – engaged in activities related to the sponsoring organisation’s mission. It typically involves a fee-based contractual arrangement between a project and an established non-profit.”</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif; font-size: 12pt;">I think it is worth repeating that while the groups it manages are non-profit, Arabella Advisors is itself a for-profit organisation.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif; font-size: 12pt;">Small organisations can undoubtedly benefit from outsourcing their administration in this way. However, Wikipedia </span><span lang="EN" style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif; font-size: 12pt;"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiscal_sponsorship#Risks"><span lang="EN-GB">points out</span></a></span><span style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif; font-size: 12pt;"> that there are risks too. For instance, it says, “the benefits of immediate tax-exempt status and administrative support must be weighed against the lack of autonomy and fees typically charged by the sponsor.”</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif; font-size: 12pt;">It seems to me that any OA organisation signing a fiscal sponsorship agreement that wishes to remain true to its principles ought really to make a special effort to be transparent about its finances and activities. The risk is that it could end up embracing a degree of darkness that belies its commitment to openness.<span></span></span></p><a name='more'></a><p></p><h2><span style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif; line-height: 115%;"><span style="font-size: large;">Two issues</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></span></h2><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif; font-size: 12pt;">As one of 150 projects managed by NVF, for instance, SPARC’s financial statements appear to be amalgamated into NFV’s public disclosure document – its </span><span lang="EN" style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif; font-size: 12pt;"><a href="https://newventurefund.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/NVF-2020-Public-Disclosure-Copy-1.pdf"><span lang="EN-GB">990 Form</span></a></span><span style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif; font-size: 12pt;">. In the process, SPARC’s financial figures are invisibilised, at least so far as the public eye is concerned.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif; font-size: 12pt;">The only financial information related to SPARC that I could find in NVF’s </span><span lang="EN" style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif; font-size: 12pt;"><a href="https://newventurefund.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/NVF-2020-Public-Disclosure-Copy-1.pdf"><span lang="EN-GB">900 Form</span></a></span><span style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif; font-size: 12pt;"> is the salary of Heather Joseph ($313,068 in 2020). The word “SPARC” itself does not seem to appear anywhere in the 990 Form.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif; font-size: 12pt;">We could also note that SPARC does not publish a definitive list of the grants it co-sponsors. This is not a consequence of SPARC’s agreement with NVF, says Joseph, but the insistence of some funders that they remain anonymous.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif; font-size: 12pt;">A requirement of the contract that SPARC has signed with NVF, however, is that it is not made publicly available. While this might be for understandable reasons, it adds to a sense of opaqueness around SPARC’s activities and might cause some to wonder to what extent SPARC has retained self-determination.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif; font-size: 12pt;">Joseph insists that SPARC is still entirely independent. She also points out that the details of the arrangement SPARC had with ARL were not published either. However, SPARC is not the organisation today that it was when it was under ARL’s wing – that, after all, is why SPARC moved to NVF.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif; font-size: 12pt;">What is also not clear (to me at least) is why NVF needs to use for-profit Arabella Advisors to provide it with services that it itself provides to others. Again, there may be a good reason for this, but it surely further muddies the waters from a public perception point of view.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif; font-size: 12pt;">In short, I am not convinced that SPARC’s fiscal sponsorship arrangement with NVF (and, via NVF, its relationship with Arabella Advisors) is a good fit for an organisation dedicated to making the world a more open and transparent place, and which is now </span><span lang="EN" style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif; font-size: 12pt;"><a href="https://investinopen.org/blog/invest-in-open-infrastructure-launches/"><span lang="EN-GB">supporting</span></a></span><span style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif; font-size: 12pt;"> those in the open access movement who want to take back scholarly publishing from for-profit organisations. However, more transparency from SPARC would surely help.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif; font-size: 12pt;">Essentially, I see two main issues. First, as noted, SPARC’s financial statements are not publicly available. While Joseph agreed to share with me the headline income figures for 2020 (below), we might wonder why it was necessary to ask for them. And we might wonder why SPARC does not publish its full financial figures on its website every year.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif; font-size: 12pt;">Here too Joseph points out that when SPARC was a program within ARL its financial statements were not posted online either. As such, she says, it is just a continuation of a long-standing practice and not contingent on its relationship with NVF. Personally, I am not persuaded by the long-standing practice argument – particularly given the OA movement’s demands that publishers provide ever greater transparency about their operations.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif; font-size: 12pt;">Second, in not publishing a comprehensive list of the grants it co-sponsors with NVF, SPARC might seem to be acting against the principles of openness that it espouses. True, some grants </span><i style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif; font-size: 12pt;">are</i><span style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif; font-size: 12pt;"> disclosed, but what percentage of the total funds distributed this represents is unclear. Joseph says that the “vast majority of philanthropies that SPARC has received funding from” are happy to have SPARC publicly acknowledge them. What this means in practice would only be fully apparent if SPARC published a full, detailed list.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif; font-size: 12pt;">Joseph explains that SPARC has to be pragmatic about this because donors sometimes insist on anonymity. I take this to mean that if SPARC wants to receive money from such a donor it has to choose either to compromise on its commitment to openness, or forego the proffered grant. Some might feel that SPARC should not be compromising in this way.

Call me naïve if you will.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif; font-size: 12pt;">It could be argued that, as a membership organisation, SPARC has no obligation to share information about its finances with the world. However, leaving aside SPARC’s professed support for openness, 50% of its income comes from grants rather than membership dues. It also enjoys the tax benefits of being part of a </span><span lang="EN" style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif; font-size: 12pt;"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/501(c)(3)_organization"><span lang="EN-GB">501c3 non-profit</span></a></span><span style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif; font-size: 12pt;">. That suggests to me that there <i>is</i> an obligation on SPARC to publish its financial statements.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif; font-size: 12pt;">More importantly, perhaps, as an influential advocacy group, SPARC has had – and continues to have – a significant impact on the global research community. More specifically, it has played an important role in changing the way that scholarly publishing operates. Potentially, therefore, its lobbying activities are going to have an impact on every researcher in the world.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif; font-size: 12pt;">Moreover, these changes seem set to embed and, arguably, worsen the existing inequalities in the system – which I must assume is not an outcome a social justice group like SPARC would have predicted or wanted.</span><span style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif; font-size: 12pt;">&nbsp;</span></p><h2 style="line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif;"><span style="font-size: large;">Complicated</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></span></h2><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif; font-size: 12pt; mso-ansi-language: EN-GB;">It does not help that the fiscal sponsorship model is complicated and (for me at least) difficult to understand.

We might also wonder whether, in its relationship with NVF (and thus Arabella), SPARC has positioned itself in a larger political landscape that some OA advocates may find unpalatable or alienating.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif; font-size: 12pt;">A key question I think is whether the scholarly community is aware of how fiscal sponsorship works, and, more specifically, of how the relationship between SPARC and NVF operates.

Two did not reply, three said they were either unaware that SPARC had a fiscal sponsorship agreement or did not feel sufficiently competent or knowledgeable about the model to comment. The last said that he had received funding from NVF co-sponsored by SPARC and that since there is a clear governance process at SPARC, he presumes there is adequate oversight over SPARC’s spendings and donations.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal;"><span lang="EN" style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif; font-size: 12pt;"><a href="https://scholarlykitchen.sspnet.org/author/planxty/"><span lang="EN-GB">Rick Anderson</span></a></span><span style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif; font-size: 12pt;">, University Librarian at </span><span lang="EN" style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif; font-size: 12pt;"><a href="https://www.byu.edu/"><span lang="EN-GB">Brigham Young University</span></a></span><span style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif; font-size: 12pt;"> and a “chef” at the </span><span lang="EN" style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif; font-size: 12pt;"><a href="https://scholarlykitchen.sspnet.org/"><span lang="EN-GB">Scholarly Kitchen</span></a></span><span style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif; font-size: 12pt;">, takes a less sanguine view. “It seems to me that someone ought to ask SPARC, publicly, to explain why important elements of its financing are hidden from public view,” he said. “It may be legal, but that doesn’t make it okay.”</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif; font-size: 12pt;">As noted, fiscal sponsorship seems to be growing in the OA movement.

NVF was the best fit for a variety of reasons including cost, services, and mission alignment.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif; font-size: 12pt;">There are quite a few advantages of having a fiscal sponsor, particularly if you are a small organisation (SPARC had only 4 FTE when we made the move). Because they provide services across a large number of projects (NVF currently provides services to over 150 projects), it lets us take advantage of economies of scale on everything from health insurance to retirement benefits to legal services we simply couldn’t do on our own.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif; font-size: 12pt;">It also allows SPARC staff to focus on mission-critical activities and leave the bulk of legal, human resources, accounting, and administrative tasks, etc. to NVF.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif; font-size: 12pt;">An added draw for us was that NVF also provides SPARC with a large community of other social justice organisations and initiatives, and we’ve benefited greatly from being a part of it.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif; font-size: 12pt;">And – you are correct, the agreement was not posted publicly; given the wide range of sensitive issue areas their projects cover, it’s NVF’s policy not to do so.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif; font-size: 12pt;">For what it’s worth, we didn’t post our annual operating contracts with ARL either.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif; font-size: 12pt;">BTW: the use of fiscal sponsor organisations is on the increase in the open movement; in particular </span><span lang="EN" style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif; font-size: 12pt;"><a href="https://codeforscience.org/"><span lang="EN-GB" style="color: #1155cc; mso-ansi-language: EN-GB;">Code for Science &amp; Society</span></a></span><span style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif; font-size: 12pt;"> is emerging as a popular choice – their projects include </span><span lang="EN" style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif; font-size: 12pt;"><a href="https://www.prereview.org/"><span lang="EN-GB" style="color: #1155cc; mso-ansi-language: EN-GB;">PREreview</span></a></span><span style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif; font-size: 12pt;">, </span><span lang="EN" style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif; font-size: 12pt;"><a href="https://investinopen.org/"><span lang="EN-GB" style="color: #1155cc; mso-ansi-language: EN-GB;">Invest in Open Infrastructure</span></a></span><span style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif; font-size: 12pt;">, </span><span lang="EN" style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif; font-size: 12pt;"><a href="https://www.researchsoft.org/"><span lang="EN-GB" style="color: #1155cc; mso-ansi-language: EN-GB;">Research Software Alliance</span></a></span><span style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif; font-size: 12pt;">, among others.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal;"><b><i><span style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif; font-size: 12pt; mso-ansi-language: EN-GB;">RP: On Twitter recently you </span></i></b><span lang="EN" style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif; font-size: 12pt;"><a href="https://twitter.com/hjoseph/status/1479223891264430083?s=20"><b><i><span lang="EN-GB" style="color: #1155cc; mso-ansi-language: EN-GB;">said</span></i></b></a></span><b><i><span style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif; font-size: 12pt; mso-ansi-language: EN-GB;">, “New Venture Fund is our fiscal sponsor (help us w/ HR, compliance, and other back-office support).” Can you say more about this and how much SPARC pays to NVF annually?</span></i></b></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal;"><b><span style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif; font-size: 12pt; mso-ansi-language: EN-GB;">HJ:</span></b><span style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif; font-size: 12pt;"> Sure thing.

Arabella provides a variety of services to NVF (and to other non-profit fiscal sponsor organisations) on a fee-for-service basis – which the NVF 990 reflects.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif; font-size: 12pt;">And I’ve seen both of the articles you reference. The “dark money” issue is about transparency preferences of donors. As we know first-hand at SPARC, many grant-making organisations and donors prefer not to be named. That definitely presents challenges for SPARC; as you rightly point out below, as an organisation advocating for open access to knowledge, we work hard to be as open and transparent as we can be.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif; font-size: 12pt;">But we also have to balance the pragmatic realities of the grant-making world with that desire.

                <p>When it comes to hoisting water, plants are real power lifters.</p>



<p>For a tall tree, slurping hundreds of liters of water each day up to its leaves or needles, where photosynthesis takes place, can be quite a haul. Even for short grasses and shrubs, rising sap must somehow overcome gravity and resistance from plant tissues. Now, a first-of-its-kind study has estimated the power needed to lift sap to plants’ foliage worldwide — and it’s a prodigious amount, almost as much as all hydroelectric power generated globally.</p>





<p>Over the course of a year, <a href="https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1029/2022JG006922">plants harness 9.4 quadrillion watt-hours of sap-pumping power</a>, climatologist Gregory Quetin and colleagues report August 17 in the <em>Journal of Geophysical Research: Biogeosciences.</em> That’s about 90 percent of the amount of hydroelectric power produced worldwide in 2019.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/forest-trees-reduce-global-warming-climate-cooling-carbon">Evaporation of water from foliage</a> drives the suction that pulls sap upward, says Quetin, of the University of California, Santa Barbara (<em>SN: 3/24/22</em>). To estimate the total evaporative power for all plants on Earth annually, the team divided up a map of the world’s land area into cells that span 0.5° of latitude by 0.5° of longitude and analyzed data for the mix of plants in each cell that were actively pumping sap each month. The power required was highest, unsurprisingly, in tree-rich areas, especially in the rainforests of the tropics.</p>

<p>If plants in forest ecosystems had to tap their own energy stores rather than rely on evaporation to pump sap, they’d need to expend about 14 percent of the energy they generated via photosynthesis, the researchers found<em>. </em>Grasses and other plants in nonforest ecosystems would need to expend just over 1 percent of their energy stores, largely because such plants are far shorter and have less resistance to the flow of sap within their tissues than woody plants do.</p>

<p><a href="https://bookshop.org/a/21798/9781771646628">The Hidden Kingdom of Fungi</a><br><em>Keith Seifert<br>Greystone Books, $27.95</em></p>



<p>Take a walk through the woods after it rains, and you can catch a glimpse of the incredible diversity of fungi. You might spot the real-life version of the red-and-white “power-up” mushroom from the video game Super Mario Bros. or the aptly named dead man’s fingers, a blackened fungal growth that resembles a hand emerging from the grave. Perhaps you’ll notice a cluster of frilly pink shelves on a log or a striking purple mushroom that’s a doppelgänger for underwater coral.</p>





<p>But for all that you can see, you’ve barely scratched the surface of the fungal world.</p>



<p>Scientists estimate there are between 1.5 million and 15 million species of fungi but so far have discovered and named only 140,000 or so. Most of that identification was performed with microscopes, but over the last two decades, DNA sequencing has allowed researchers to distinguish large numbers of microfungi. It’s these rarely noticed and poorly understood fungi that mycologist Keith Seifert focuses on in his book <em>The Hidden Kingdom of Fungi.</em></p>



<p>Seifert has spent his career “obsessing over Latin names of fungi” but recognizes that taxonomy may not come easily to his readers. So he begins with a note on scientific names, explaining why they’re a “necessary evil” and providing a primer on the modern classification system, likening it to “a phone book for looking up the evolutionary address of a fungus.”</p>





<p>From there, the book explores fungi&#8217;s evolutionary journey and the various <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/gene-study-digs-partnership-between-fungi-and-plants">symbiotic relationships they have with other organisms</a> (<em>SN: 2/23/15</em>)<em>. </em>These relationships have muddied scientists’ picture of ecology and evolution. In the traditional view of evolution proposed by Charles Darwin, competition is seen as the driving force of natural selection. But Darwin “underplayed the significance of cooperation in nature,” Seifert writes. Take <a href="https://www.mdpi.com/journal/jof/special_issues/Lichens_sensors">the evolutionary success of lichens</a>, a highly diverse group that has spread around the world. These complex organisms consist of an alga and fungus living together in a mutually beneficial relationship.</p>



<p>Throughout the book, Seifert delves deeper into fungi’s complicated relationships with other organisms, covering the role fungi play in forest ecology, agriculture, fermentation, the built environment and even the human body. Here, there’s something for everyone. Nature lovers will enjoy learning about the <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/communism-trees-goes-underground">“Wood Wide Web”</a> (<em>SN: 8/9/97</em>), an underground network of mycorrhizal fungi that connect to tree roots, enabling trees to exchange water, nutrients and minerals. Gardeners and farmers can gain applicable knowledge about the fungi that can help or harm crops. Foodies will find themselves singing fungi’s praises after learning about the yeasts and molds that give us the “sacred fungal trilogy” of wine, cheese and chocolate. But many readers might cringe as Seifert takes them on a room-by-room tour of which fungal species lurk in a person’s house or shares <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/fungal-infection-disease-serious-threat-sailor-case">how fungi can cause illness</a> (<em>SN: 11/29/21</em>).</p>



<p>As the book ends, Seifert focuses on how humans and fungi can build a better world together. Humans have already used fungi to create a range of products like penicillin, stone-washed denim and the meat substitute Quorn. Now, fungi are also helping with environmental cleanup and the creation of leather-like textiles and solid building materials. We’ve put only a few fungal species to work so far, but the possibilities are endless. Seifert paints a picture of what a healthier, more sustainable future could look like, with fungal foam beds and bioluminescent lamps. Such a future isn’t some far-off fantasy, he writes, at least from a technological standpoint. But there’s more than just technical know-how in creating a more sustainable and symbiotic world.</p>



<p>We also must reconsider our attitude toward fungi, Seifert says. “If we are going to make peace with fungi, we need to be aware of their biodiversity and embrace their talents for biodegradation, symbiosis, and biochemistry that make them such significant players in the environment,” he writes. “Only then will we be able to work with them effectively for our own prosperity and health, while they also collaborate with us.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/democracy-indigenous-americans-people-rule-muscogee">Indigenous Americans ruled democratically long before the U.S. did</a></h4>

              
                <p>On sunny summer days, powerboats pulling water-skiers zip across Georgia’s Lake Oconee, a reservoir located about an hour-and-a-half drive east of Atlanta. For those without a need for speed, fishing beckons.</p>



<p>Little do the lake’s visitors suspect that here lie the remains of a democratic institution that dates to around 500 A.D., more than 1,200 years before the founding of the U.S. Congress.</p>



<p>Reservoir waters, which flooded the Oconee Valley in 1979 after the construction of a nearby dam, partly cover remnants of a 1,500-year-old plaza once bordered by flat-topped earthen mounds and at least three large, circular buildings. Such structures, which have been linked to collective decision making, are known from other southeastern U.S. sites that date to as early as around 1,000 years ago.</p>





<p>At the Oconee site, called Cold Springs, artifacts were excavated before the valley became an aquatic playground. Now, new older-than-expected radiocarbon dates for those museum-held finds <a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/american-antiquity/article/early-materialization-of-democratic-institutions-among-the-ancestral-muskogean-of-the-american-southeast/5B00F098F5A279B3EDC97E2BB0944FC5">push back the origin of democratic institutions in the Americas several centuries</a>, a team led by archaeologist Victor Thompson of the University of Georgia in Athens reported May 18 in <em>American Antiquity</em>.</p>



<p>Institutions such as these highlight a growing realization among archaeologists that early innovations in democratic rule emerged independently in many parts of the world. In specific, these findings add to evidence that Native American institutions devoted to promoting broad participation in political decisions emerged in various regions, including what’s now Canada, the United States and Mexico, long before 18th century Europeans took up the cause of democratic rule by the people.</p>



<p>That conclusion comes as no surprise to members of some Indigenous groups today. “Native people have been trying to convey for centuries that many communities have long-standing institutions [of] democratic and/or republican governance,” says University of Alberta archaeologist S. Margaret Spivey-Faulkner, a citizen of the Pee Dee Indian Nation of Beaver Creek in South Carolina.</p>



<h4>Democratic innovations</h4>



<p>Scholars have traditionally thought that democracy — generally referring to rule by the people, typically via elected representatives — originated around 2,500 years ago in Greece before spreading elsewhere in Europe. From that perspective, governments in the Americas that qualified as democratic didn’t exist before Europeans showed up. &nbsp;</p>



<p>That argument is as misguided as Christopher Columbus’ assumption that he had arrived in East India, not the Caribbean, in 1492, says archaeologist Jacob Holland-Lulewicz of Penn State, a coauthor of the Cold Springs report. Institutions that enabled representatives of large communities to govern collectively, without kings or ruling chiefs, characterized an unappreciated number of Indigenous societies long before the Italian explorer’s fateful first voyage, Holland-Lulewicz asserts.</p>



<p>In fact, collective decision-making arrangements that <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/human-history-society-dawn-of-everything-book">kept anyone from amassing too much power and wealth</a> go back thousands, and probably tens of thousands of years in many parts of the world (<em>SN: 11/9/21</em>). The late anthropologist David Graeber and archaeologist David Wengrow of University College London describe evidence for that scenario in their 2021 book <em>The Dawn of Everything</em>.</p>



<p>But only in the last 20 years have archaeologists begun to take seriously claims that ancient forms of democratic rule existed. Scientific investigations informed by Indigenous partners will unveil past political realities “most of us in Indian country take for granted,” Spivey-Faulkner says.</p>



<h4>Early consensus</h4>



<p>Thompson’s Cold Springs project shows how such a partnership can work.</p>



<p>Ancestors of today&#8217;s Muscogee people erected Cold Springs structures within their original homelands, which once covered a big chunk of southeastern North America before the government-forced exodus west along the infamous Trail of Tears. Three members of the Muscogee Nation’s Department of Historic and Cultural Preservation in Okmulgee, Okla., all study coauthors, provided archaeologists with first-hand knowledge of Muscogee society. They emphasized to the researchers that present-day Muscogee councils where open debate informs consensus decisions carry on a tradition that goes back hundreds of generations. &nbsp;</p>



<p>A set of 44 new radiocarbon dates going back 1,500 years for material previously unearthed at the Georgia site, including what were likely interior posts from some structures, then made perfect sense. Earlier analyses in the 1970s of excavated pottery and six radiocarbon dates from two earthen mounds at Cold Springs suggested that they had been constructed at least 1,000 years ago.</p>



<p>Based on the new dating, Thompson’s team found that from roughly 500 A.D. to 700 A.D, Indigenous people at Cold Springs constructed not only earthen mounds but at least three council-style roundhouses — each 12 to 15 meters in diameter — and several smaller structures possibly used as temporary housing during meetings and ceremonies.</p>



<p>Small communities spread across the Oconee Valley formed tight-knit social networks called clans that gathered at council houses through the 1700s, Thompson’s group suspects. Spanish expeditions through the region from 1539 to 1543 did not cause those societies and their traditions to collapse, as has often been assumed, the researchers contend.</p>

<p>Excavations and radiocarbon dating at another Oconee Valley Muscogee site called Dyar support that view. A square ground connected to Dyar includes remains of a council house. Activity at the site began &nbsp;as early as 1350 and continued until as late as about 1670, or <a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/american-antiquity/article/abs/enduring-traditions-and-the-immateriality-of-early-colonial-encounters-in-the-southeastern-united-states/709B1189E8134314A0096F5BB1D38A44">about 130 years after first encounters</a> with the Spanish, Holland-Lulewicz and colleagues reported in the October 2020 <em>American Antiquity</em>.</p>



<p>Spanish historical accounts mistakenly assumed that powerful chiefs ran Indigenous communities in what have become known as chiefdoms. Many archaeologists have similarly, and just as wrongly, assumed that starting around 1,000 years ago, chiefs monopolized power in southeastern Native American villages, the scientists argue.</p>



<p>Today, members of the Muscogee (Creek) Nation in Oklahoma gather, sometimes by the hundreds or more, in circular structures called council houses to reach collective decisions about various community issues. Council houses typically border public square grounds. That’s a modern-day parallel to the story being told by the ancient architecture at Cold Springs.</p>



<p>“Muscogee councils are the longest-surviving democratic institution in the world,” Holland-Lulewicz says.</p>



<h4>Indigenous influencers</h4>



<p>Political consensus building by early Muscogee people didn’t occur in a vacuum. Across different regions of precontact North America, institutions that enabled broad participation in democratic governing characterized Indigenous societies that <a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpos.2022.840049/full">had no kings, central state governments or bureaucracies</a>, Holland-Lulewicz and colleagues, report March 11 in <em>Frontiers in Political Science</em>.</p>



<p>The researchers dub such organizations keystone institutions. Representatives of households, communities, clans and religious societies, to name a few, met on equal ground at keystone institutions. Here, all manner of groups and organizations followed common rules to air their opinions and hammer out decisions about, say, distributing crops, organizing ceremonial events and resolving disputes.</p>

<p>For example, in the early 1600s, nations of the neighboring Wendat (Huron) and Haudenosaunee people in northeastern North America had formed political alliances known as confederacies, says coauthor Jennifer Birch, a University of Georgia archaeologist. Each population contained roughly 20,000 to 30,000 people. Despite their size, these confederacies did not hold elections in which individuals voted for representatives to a central governing body. Governing consisted of negotiations among intertwined segments of society orchestrated by clans, which claimed members across society.</p>



<p>Clans, in which membership was inherited through the female line, were — and still are — the social glue holding together Wendat (Huron) and Haudenosaunee politics. Residents of different villages or nations among, say, the Haudenosaunee, could belong to the same clan, creating a network of social ties. Excavations of Indigenous villages in eastern North America suggest that the earliest clans date to at least 3,000 years ago, Birch says.</p>



<p>Within clans, men and women held separate council meetings. Some councils addressed civil affairs. Others addressed military and foreign policy, typically after receiving counsel from senior clan women.</p>



<p>Clans controlled seats on confederacy councils of the Wendat and Haudenosaunee. But decisions hinged on negotiation and consensus. A member of a particular clan had no right to interfere in the affairs of any other clan. Members of villages or nations could either accept or reject a clan leader as their council representative. Clans could also join forces to pursue political or military objectives.</p>



<p>Some researchers, including Graeber and Wengrow, suspect a Wendat philosopher and statesman named Kandiaronk influenced ideas about democracy among Enlightenment thinkers in France and elsewhere. A 1703 book based on a French aristocrat’s conversations with Kandiaronk critiqued authoritarian European states and provided an Indigenous case for decentralized, representative governing.</p>



<p>Although Kandiaronk was a real person, <a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/american-antiquity/article/abs/dawn-of-everything-a-new-history-of-humanity-david-graeber-and-david-wengrow-2021-farrar-straus-and-giroux-new-york-xii-692-pp-3500-hardcover-isbn-9780374157357/8459DF1B04F20E239E0C04E2BD69FE0F">it’s unclear whether that book presented his actual ideas</a> or altered them to resemble what Europeans thought of as a “noble savage,” Birch says.</p>



<p>Researchers also debate whether writers of the U.S. Constitution were influenced by how the Haudenosaunee Confederacy distributed power among allied nations. <a href="https://www.haudenosauneeconfederacy.com/influence-on-democracy/">Benjamin Franklin learned about Haudenosaunee politics during the 1740s and 1750s</a> as colonists tried to establish treaties with the confederacy.</p>



<p>Colonists took selected political ideas from the Haudenosaunee Confederacy without grasping its underlying cultural concerns, says University of Alberta anthropological archaeologist Kisha Supernant, a member of an Indigenous population in Canada called Métis. The U.S. Constitution stresses individual freedoms, whereas the Indigenous system addresses collective responsibilities to manage the land, water, animals and people, she says.</p>



<h4>Anti-Aztec equality</h4>



<p>If democratic institutions are cultural experiments in power sharing, one of the most interesting examples emerged around 700 years ago in central Mexico.</p>



<p>In response to growing hostilities from surrounding allies of the Aztec Empire, a multi-ethnic confederation of villages called Tlaxcallan built a densely occupied city of the same name. When Spaniards arrived in 1519, they wrote of Tlaxcallan as a city without kings, rulers or wealthy elites.</p>

<p>Until the last decade, Mexican historians had argued that Tlaxcallan was a minor settlement, not a city. &nbsp;They dismissed historical Spanish accounts as exaggerations of the newcomers’ exploits.</p>



<p>Opinions changed after a team led by archaeologist Lane Fargher of Mexico’s Centro de Investigación y Estudios Avanzados del Instituto Polytécnico Nacional (Cinvestav del IPN) in Merida surveyed and mapped visible remains of Tlaxcallan structures from 2007 to 2010. Excavations followed from 2015 through 2018, revealing a much larger and denser settlement than previously suspected.</p>



<p>The ancient city covers a series of hilltops and hillsides, Fargher says. Large terraces carved out of hillsides supported houses, public structures, plazas, earthen mounds and roadways. Around 35,000 people inhabited an area of about 4.5 square kilometers in the early 1500s.</p>



<p>Artifacts recovered at plazas indicate that those open spaces hosted commercial, political and religious activities. Houses clustered around plazas. Even the largest residences were modest in size, not much larger than the smallest houses. Palaces of kings and political big shots in neighboring societies, including the Aztecs, dwarfed Tlaxcallan houses.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="675" height="450" src="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/082622_bb_democracy_inline2-675x450.jpg" alt="photo showing excavated building foundations at Tlaxcallan" class="wp-image-3116797" srcset="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/082622_bb_democracy_inline2-675x450.jpg 675w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/082622_bb_democracy_inline2-575x383.jpg 575w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/082622_bb_democracy_inline2-279x186.jpg 279w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/082622_bb_democracy_inline2.jpg 680w" sizes="(max-width: 675px) 100vw, 675px" /><figcaption><span class="caption wp-caption-3116797">Excavations at the ancient Mexican city of Tlaxcallan unearthed remnants of this roughly 90-square-meter house. Other Tlaxcallan houses range in area from about 40 to 220 square meters. Building materials and construction quality are comparable for all structures.</span><span class="credit wp-credit-3116797">L. Fargher</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>Excavations and Spanish accounts add up to a scenario in which all Tlaxcallan citizens could participate in governmental affairs. Anyone known to provide good advice on local issues could be elected by their neighbors in a residential district to a citywide ruling council, or senate, consisting of between 50 and 200 members. Council meetings were held at a civic-ceremonial center built on a hilltop about one kilometer from Tlaxcallan.</p>



<p>As many as 4,000 people attended council meetings regarding issues of utmost importance, such as launching military campaigns, Fargher says.</p>



<p>Those chosen for council positions had to endure a public ceremony in which they were stripped naked, shoved, hit and insulted as a reminder that they served the people. Political officials who accumulated too much wealth could be publicly punished, replaced or even killed.</p>



<p>Tlaxcallan wasn’t a social utopia. Women, for instance, had limited political power, possibly because the main route to government positions involved stints of military service. But in many ways,<a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpos.2022.832440/full"> political participation at Tlaxcallan equaled or exceeded</a> that documented for ancient Greek democracy, Fargher and colleagues reported March 29 in <em>Frontiers of Political Science</em>. Greeks from all walks of life gathered in public spaces to speak freely about political issues. But commoners and the poor could not hold the highest political offices. And again, women were excluded.</p>



<h4>Good government</h4>



<p>Tlaxcallan aligned itself with Spanish conquerors against their common Aztec enemy. Then in 1545, the Spanish divided the Tlaxcallan state into four fiefdoms, ending Tlaxcallan’s homegrown style of democratic rule.</p>



<p>The story of this fierce, equality-minded government illustrates the impermanence of political systems that broadly distribute power, Fargher says. Research on past societies worldwide “shows us how bad the human species is at building and maintaining democratic governments,” he contends.</p>



<p>Archaeologist Richard Blanton of Purdue University and colleagues, including Fargher, analyzed whether 30 premodern societies dating to as early as around 3,000 years ago <a href="https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/10.1086/713286">displayed signs of “good government.”</a> An overall score of government quality included evidence of systems for providing equal justice, fair taxation, control over political officials’ power and a political voice for all citizens.</p>



<p>Only eight societies received high scores, versus 12 that scored low, Blanton’s group reported in the February 2021 <em>Current Anthropology</em>. The remaining 10 societies partly qualified as good governments. Many practices of societies scoring highest on good government mirrored policies of liberal democracies over the past century, the researchers concluded.</p>



<p>That’s only a partial view of how past governments operated. But <a href="https://freedomhouse.org/report/freedom-world/2020/leaderless-struggle-democracy">surveys of modern nations suggest that no more than half feature strong democratic institutions</a>, Fargher says.</p>



<p>Probing the range of democratic institutions that societies have devised over the millennia may inspire reforms to modern democratic nations facing growing income disparities and public distrust of authorities, Holland-Lulewicz suspects. Leaders and citizens of stressed democracies today might start with a course on power sharing in Indigenous societies. School will be in session at the next meeting of the Muscogee National Council.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/omicron-booster-shot-vaccine-covid-coronavirus-pfizer-moderna">What you need to know about the new omicron booster shots</a></h4>

              
                <p>Revamped COVID-19 vaccines are poised to do battle with the super-contagious omicron variant.</p>



<p>On September 1, U.S. health officials greenlit the first major update of the mRNA-based shots, reformulated to recognize both the original version of SARS-CoV-2 and the recently circulating versions of omicron. Those mRNA vaccine boosters could start going into arms within days.</p>



<p>“They can help restore protection that has waned since previous vaccination and were designed to provide broader protection against newer variants,” Rochelle Walensky, director of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, said in a statement after <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/media/releases/2022/s0901-covid-19-booster.html">endorsing a vaccine advisory committee’s approval</a> of the shots.&nbsp;</p>





<p>Both Moderna and Pfizer and its German partner BioNTech <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/covid-vaccine-booster-omicron-variant-coronavirus">created boosters</a> that contain instructions for making the BA.4 and BA.5 omicron subvariants’ spike protein as well as the original virus’ spike protein (<em>SN: 6/30/22</em>). Those two variants now account for nearly all the new cases in the United States. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration granted <a href="https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/coronavirus-covid-19-update-fda-authorizes-moderna-pfizer-biontech-bivalent-covid-19-vaccines-use">emergency use authorization</a> for the shots August 31. The CDC action means the Pfizer booster is now OK’d for those 12 and older; Moderna’s shot is for those 18 and older.</p>



<p>The <a href="https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/news/first-adapted-covid-19-booster-vaccines-recommended-approval-eu">European Medicines Agency</a> and <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/health-canada/news/2022/09/health-canada-authorizes-first-bivalent-covid-19-booster-for-adults-18-years-and-older.html">Health Canada</a> also authorized use of an updated booster vaccine on September 1. That one, made by Moderna, contains mRNA instructions for building the original coronavirus spike protein and the spike protein from the omicron BA.1 subvariant. The United Kingdom, Switzerland and Australia have already given the nod for use of that dual, or bivalent, booster.</p>



<p>Here’s what to know about the new shots:</p>



<h4>Should I get a booster shot?</h4>



<p>Probably. The CDC now recommends that all fully vaccinated people 12 and older get the bivalent shot, provided it has been at least two months since their last vaccine dose. “If you are eligible, there is no bad time to get your COVID-19 booster and I strongly encourage you to receive it,” Walensky said.</p>



<p>That recommendation comes regardless of how many boosters people have already had.</p>



<p>“If you perceive this as big change … you’re right,” Evelyn Twentyman, who leads CDC’s vaccine policy unit, said September 1 during the <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/acip/meetings/slides-2022-09-01-02.html">vaccine advisory committee meeting</a>. “We want to emphasize we’re no longer looking at total number of doses,” she said. From now on, the agency hopes to transition into a more regular schedule for COVID-19 vaccines, similar to getting annual flu shots. &nbsp;</p>



<p>The original vaccines will still be used for the first two doses, but bivalent vaccines will replace the old boosters for all but 5- to 11-year-olds. Pfizer’s original vaccine booster is still available for that age group but bivalent vaccines may come later this year for children as young as 6 months old.</p>



<p>There was another big difference this time around: The decision to move forward with the BA.4/5 boosters was made without data from human trials. Such trials are under way, but results won’t be known until the end of the year.</p>



<aside class="wp-block-sciencenews-inline-related-post alignleft"><h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/sign-up-for-e-mail-updates-on-the-coronavirus-outbreak">Sign up for e-mail updates on the latest coronavirus news and research</a></h4></aside>



<p>In authorizing the new boosters without clinical trial data, the agencies are treating COVID-19 vaccines more like annual flu vaccines.</p>



<p>Data collected from people immunized with the BA.1 boosters and data from studies of mice inoculated with the BA.4/5 vaccine were used as evidence of the new boosters’ likely safety and effectiveness. The European Medicines Agency said in a Sept. 2 press briefing that it would <a href="https://twitter.com/EMA_News/status/1565673077412855808">also use the BA.1 booster to evaluate the new shots</a>.</p>



<h4>Why do the shots target the BA.4 and BA.5 omicron subvariants?</h4>



<p>“We very <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNFES1RLf1M">deliberately picked BA.4/5</a>,” Peter Marks, director of the FDA’s Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research, which oversees vaccines, said in a news briefing August 31.</p>



<p>Both companies have tested vaccines based on the omicron BA.1 variant in humans. But BA.1, which caused the massive surge earlier in the year, is no longer circulating in the United States. As of the week of August 21 through 27, BA.5 was projected to cause about <a href="https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/?CDC_AA_refVal=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cdc.gov%2Fcoronavirus%2F2019-ncov%2Fcases-updates%2Fcases-in-us.html&amp;fbclid=IwAR20LcCiCyoPDMoPXYAuRd9rIL3w3OxU45OEo4_pdpAGFbuwvIXdU6pfw0w#variant-proportions">89 percent of COVID-19 cases</a>, with BA.4 variants responsible for about 11 percent of cases.</p>



<p>“This gives us a variant that is most up-to-date, and most likely looks closer to something that may evolve further in the fall,” Marks said. “The more up-to-date you are, the better chance we have of [the vaccine] working for what comes afterward.”</p>



<p>All omicron subvariants share common mutations. But the shape of BA.4/5’s spike protein <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/acip/meetings/downloads/slides-2022-09-01/03-COVID-Thornburg-508.pdf">looks much different to the immune system</a> than other omicron subvariants do, the CDC’s Natalie Thornburg said at the advisory committee meeting. Those differences may train immune cells to build a wider variety of antibodies that can latch onto a broad array of variants.</p>



<p>Mice inoculated with a BA.4/5 containing booster had <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/acip/meetings/downloads/slides-2022-09-01/06-COVID-Miller-508.pdf">fewer viruses in their lungs</a> than mice given a BA.1 boosters, Moderna’s Jacqueline Miller said at the CDC meeting. The mice make a human version of ACE2, the protein on the surface of cells that the coronavirus uses to gain entry. Mouse studies of earlier variant boosters corresponded well to levels of protection seen in human clinical trials, Miller said, so the company is hopeful that the BA.4/5 booster will provide good protection, too.</p>



<p>Bivalent vaccines perform better — raising antibody levels higher in people and animals — than ones that contain just the original spike protein or only a variant spike protein, Miller said. The spike protein that grabs onto human cells is a three-pronged claw. With the bivalent vaccine, each prong could be either an original or an omicron version. The mixed claw may expose parts of the spike to the immune system that are normally hidden, Miller suggested.</p>

<h4>Why now?</h4>



<p>Though the mouse data suggest the BA.4/5 booster will work, some of the CDC advisers said they’d be more comfortable having data from the ongoing human clinical trials before recommending the new shots. That data could be available in a couple of months, so why not wait?</p>



<p>The wait could cost lives and money, computer projections suggest. The COVID-19 scenario modeling hub, a consortium of pandemic forecasters who predict COVID-19 patterns over the next six months under varying conditions, considered what would happen in the United States if the boosters were given in September or not until November. Waiting would lead to <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/acip/meetings/downloads/slides-2022-09-01/08-COVID-Oliver-508.pdf">137,000 more hospitalizations and 9,700 more deaths</a>, the researchers projected.</p>



<p>An early fall booster campaign could <a href="https://www.commonwealthfund.org/blog/2022/how-many-lives-could-fall-covid-19-booster-campaign-save-united-states">save more than $62 billion in direct medical costs</a>, an analysis from the Commonwealth Fund projects.</p>



<h4>Is it safe?</h4>



<p>Based on studies with the BA.1 bivalent booster, yes. That shot produced similar side effects to the original shots.</p>



<p>And it’s also safe to get <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/acip/meetings/downloads/slides-2022-09-01/09-COVID-Hall-508.pdf">flu shots and other vaccines</a>, including ones used against monkeypox, at the same time as the COVID-19 booster. In fact, doctors should offer all vaccines for which a person is eligible at the same visit, Elisha Hall of the CDC said.</p>



<p>Some data indicate that the chance of serious side effects, like heart inflammation called myocarditis, happen at similar or lower rates with boosters than with the second doses of the mRNA vaccines. The side effect is rare; CDC has verified <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/acip/meetings/downloads/slides-2022-09-01/05-COVID-Shimabukuro-508.pdf">131 myocarditis cases out of more than 126 million booster doses</a> given, Tom Shimabukuro of the CDC COVID-19 Vaccine Safety Unit reported. The rate of myocarditis is <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/acip/meetings/downloads/slides-2022-09-01/08-COVID-Oliver-508.pdf">1.8 to 5.6 times higher after a COVID-19 infection</a> than after vaccination for 12- to 17-year-old males — the group for which the condition has the highest risk, the CDC’s Sara Oliver said. &nbsp;Spacing the booster at least two months after the last dose of vaccine may help to head off any increase in myocarditis, Marks said in the FDA press briefing.</p>



<p>“We have a tremendous amount of experience with the monovalent, original vaccine,” the FDA’s Doran Fink said during the CDC advisory meeting. That experience made the FDA comfortable extrapolating data from the BA.1 booster trials to decide that the new shots are also safe. &nbsp;</p>



<p>“We don’t usually have too much clinical information … when we are thinking about changing influenza vaccines,” said Sarah Long, an infectious diseases pediatrician at Drexel University College of Medicine in Philadelphia. Much like the flu vaccine remodels last season’s version, the updated COVID-19 booster is built on the same scaffolding as the original version. “It’s part of the same roof. We’re just putting in some dormers and windows.”</p>



<p>Pablo Sanchez, a pediatric infectious diseases doctor at The Ohio State University and Nationwide Children’s Hospital in Columbus, cast the sole dissenting vote against recommending the BA.4/5 boosters. Other committee members voted to recommend the boosters, but they voiced reservations about those votes.</p>



<p>“I really don’t want to establish a precedent of recommending a vaccine that we don’t have clinical data on,” Sanchez said. He added, “I’m comfortable that the vaccine will likely be safe like the others,” but having the human data may help counter vaccine hesitancy.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/diamonds-laser-plastic-bottle-planets-physics">Zapping plastic with a laser forged tiny diamonds</a></h4>

              
                <p>A laser blast produces miniature diamonds from plain-old plastic. That’s right, the same kind used in soda bottles.</p>



<p>When squeezed to about a million times Earth’s atmospheric pressure and heated to thousands of degrees Celsius, polyethylene terephthalate, or PET, <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.abo0617">forms nanodiamonds</a>, physicist Dominik Kraus and colleagues report September 2 in <em>Science Advances</em>.</p>



<p>Ice giant planets, such as Neptune and Uranus, have similar temperatures, pressures and combinations of chemical elements as the materials in the study, suggesting that diamonds may rain down in those planets’ interiors. What’s more, the researchers say, the new technique could be used to manufacture nanodiamonds for use in quantum devices and other applications.</p>





<p>In the new study, researchers trained lasers on samples of plastic. Each laser blast sent a shock wave careening through the plastic, amping up the pressure and temperature within. Probing the material with bursts of X-rays revealed that nanodiamonds had formed.</p>



<p>Previous studies had created diamonds by compressing compounds of hydrogen and carbon. But PET, which is commonly used in food and drink packaging, contains not just hydrogen and carbon but also oxygen. That makes it a better match to the composition of ice giant planets like Neptune and Uranus. The oxygen seems to assist the diamond formation, says Kraus, of the University of Rostock in Germany. “The oxygen sucks out the hydrogen,” he says, leaving behind carbon which can then form diamond.</p>



<p>Nanodiamonds are commonly produced using explosives, Kraus says, a process not easy to control. The new technique could create nanodiamonds that are more easily tailored for particular uses, such as <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/designer-diamonds-could-one-day-help-build-quantum-internet">quantum devices made using diamond with defects</a> where, for example, nitrogen atoms replace some of the carbon atoms (<em>SN: 7/6/18</em>).</p>



<p>“The idea is quite cool. You take water bottle plastic; you zap it with a laser to make diamond. How practical it is, I don’t know,” says physicist Marius Millot of Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory in California, who was not involved with the new study. How easily the diamonds could be recovered is unclear, he says. But, “it’s pretty neat to think about the idea.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/volcano-eruption-deadly-warning-nyiragong-congo">In 2021, a deadly volcano erupted with no warning. Here’s why</a></h4>

              
                <p>In May 2021, Congo’s Mount Nyiragongo, one of the world’s most dangerous volcanoes, burst to life without warning. Lava erupted from fissures and flowed down the mountain toward cities below, leaving hundreds dead or missing and hundreds more injured.</p>



<p>Now, using data from monitoring stations installed near the volcano in 2015, researchers have pieced together <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-022-05047-8">how that eruption happened so suddenly</a>. The data also suggest that the event could have been even deadlier — and highlight the urgent need to better understand this volcano’s particular hazards before the next eruption, volcanologist Delphine Smittarello and colleagues report in the Sept. 1 <em>Nature</em>.</p>





<p>“Nyiragongo is unique in that 1 million people are living just at the foot of the volcano,” says Smittarello, of the European Center for Geodynamics and Seismology in Luxembourg. The mountain <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/studying-volcano-war-zone">sits near the eastern border of Congo</a>, looming over both the Congolese city of Goma, population of about 700,000, and the Rwandan city of Gisenyi, population about 83,000 (<em>SN: 12/2/14</em>). “There are so many people so close to a very dangerous place.”</p>



<p>Nyiragongo’s last two eruptions, in 1977 and 2002, were both presaged by days of distinct seismic rumblings strong enough to be felt by people living nearby. But before the eruption on May 22, 2021, even the sensitive monitoring stations near the volcano seemed to detect no clear warning signs of magma on the move underground.</p>



<p>There was the large lake of molten lava burbling in the volcano’s summit crater: By 2021, that lake had risen to near the top of the crater. But typically lake level alone isn’t enough to indicate an imminent eruption, Smittarello says. Levels had intermittently risen and fallen over the years since 2002 as magma moved around the volcano’s deep plumbing. And in 2021, the lake was still 85 meters below its 2002 level.</p>



<p>So Smittarello and her colleagues took another look at the monitoring stations’ seismic and acoustic data. This time, the analysis identified a rumbling of small quakes that commenced just 40 minutes before the actual eruption. Half an hour later, just 10 minutes before the lava burst through, detections of acoustic signals — <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/cotopaxi-volcano-ecuador-infrasound">low-frequency “infrasound” waves</a> — began to increase, a hint that the volcano was about to erupt (<em>SN: 6/25/18</em>).</p>



<p>The trigger for the actual eruption was probably a tiny rupture that formed in the volcanic cone due to the buildup of stress over time from the pressure and heat of the magma within, the researchers say. That would have been enough to allow the magma to push through.</p>



<p>The short lag time between the signals and the eruption was probably because that magma was already extremely close to the surface, the researchers suggest. “What we monitor is the magma moving, not the presence or absence of magma,” Smittarello says. Because the magma had very little distance to travel, there was also very little warning.</p>



<p>&nbsp;The eruption itself lasted about six hours, but in its aftermath, there was plenty of seismic activity lasting another 10 days, suggesting the magma was now on the move. Those data, monitored in real time, indicated something troubling — the magma was moving underground, away from the summit, snaking beneath the city of Goma and nearby Lake Kivu.</p>



<p>As the magma migrated, scientists and local citizens worked together to trace the formation of cracks in the ground, which can indicate propagating dikes, lateral pathways through which magma is moving beneath the surface. Similar lateral pathways formed during the eruption of Kilauea in Hawaii, Smittarello says. In that case, the magma <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/kilauea-volcano-pyrotechnics-lava-no-signs-stopping">migrated to a neighborhood</a> along the volcano’s lower east rift zone before erupting (<em>SN: 7/6/18</em>).</p>



<p>Based on the possible path of the magma, Goma city officials issued evacuation orders for tens of thousands of people who were potentially in the magma’s path. Meanwhile, scientists anxiously watched for signs of a potential “<a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/cameroons-killer-lakes-rising-threat">limnic eruption</a>” at Lake Kivu — a rare type of disaster in which a noxious cloud of dissolved gases like carbon dioxide and methane suddenly erupts from deep lakes, suffocating living creatures nearby (<em>SN: 4/2/94</em>). Gas-rich magma seeping into the lake&#8217;s bottom could have triggered such an eruption. In either case, “if [the magma] finds a path to the surface, it’s a catastrophe,” Smittarello says.</p>



<p>Neither catastrophe occurred, thankfully, Smittarello says. “It was a lucky situation. But we don’t know why.”</p>



<p>It was especially lucky given the fact that the magma was closer to the surface than thought at the time, the team reports in the new study. That means the residents above were even closer to greater disaster than had been realized.</p>



<p>Reanalysis of posteruptive seismic data let the researchers determine the actual position of the underground dikes. The team found that one dike beneath Goma was as shallow as 450 meters deep. That’s particularly surprising because such a shallow magma channel would be expected to emit a telltale cocktail of volcanic gases from the ground cracks.</p>

<h3>What lies beneath</h3>



<p>In the aftermath of Congo’s Mount Nyiragongo eruption on May 22, 2021,&nbsp; seismic data (black circles) indicated that magma was moving underground away from the volcano’s summit and toward the city of Goma and Lake Kivu. In a new study, researchers used those data to map the extent and width of the dike (widest at the reddest color). To their surprise, they found that it was as shallow as just 450 meters beneath Goma at one point and presented a serious threat.</p>

<p>It’s not unheard-of for volcanic dikes to give no gassy indicators of their presence, says geophysicist Michael Poland of the U.S. Geological Survey, who is based in Vancouver, Wash., and leads the Yellowstone Volcano Observatory. The magma may have lost a lot of its gases as it circulated up into the summit lava lake; by the time it pushed into underground channels, it was potentially already degassed.</p>



<p>But that scenario is worrisome because there’s one fewer warning signal of possible danger to the communities above, says Poland, who was not involved in the new study. It also raises new questions — such as how such gas-poor magma might interact with Lake Kivu if it does flow into the lake.</p>



<p>What the 2021 eruption makes clear is that scientists need to investigate such questions to get a better understanding of the peculiarities of Nyiragongo — and to tailor monitoring and hazard warnings accordingly, Poland adds.</p>



<p>All volcanoes have their own personalities, and scientists need to develop a better appreciation for any warning signs that might exist. In this case, for example, that might include the lava lake level, he says. “The traditional approach is less reliable at Nyiragongo.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/james-webb-space-telescope-first-exoplanet-image">Here’s the James Webb telescope’s first direct image of an exoplanet</a></h4>

              
                <p>This is the first picture of an exoplanet from the James Webb Space Telescope.</p>



<p>“We’re actually measuring photons from the atmosphere of the planet itself,” says astronomer Sasha Hinkley of the University of Exeter in England. Seeing those particles of light, “to me, that’s very exciting.”</p>



<p>The planet is about seven times the mass of Jupiter and lies more than 100 times farther from its star than Earth sits from the sun, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.14990">direct observations of exoplanet HIP 65426 b</a> show. It’s also young, about 10 million or 20 million years old, compared with the more than 4-billion-year-old Earth, Hinkley and colleagues report in a study submitted August 31 at arXiv.org.</p>





<p>Those three features — size, distance and youth — made HIP 65426 b relatively easy to see, and so a good planet to test JWST’s observing abilities. And the telescope has <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/james-webb-space-telescope-first-image-nasa">once again surpassed astronomers’ expectations</a> (<em>SN: 7/11/22</em>).</p>



<p>“We’ve demonstrated really how powerful JWST is as an instrument for the direct imaging of exoplanets,” says exoplanet astronomer and coauthor Aarynn Carter of the University of California, Santa Cruz.</p>



<p>Astronomers have found <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/exoplanet-nasa-confirmed-5000-milestone-galaxy">more than 5,000 planets orbiting other stars</a> (<em>SN: 3/22/22</em>). But almost all of those planets were detected indirectly, either by the planets tugging on the stars with their gravity or blocking starlight as they cross between the star and a telescope’s view.</p>



<p>To see a planet directly, astronomers have to block out the light from its star and let the planet’s own light shine, a tricky process. It’s <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/extrasolar-planetary-system-makes-pictorial-debut">been</a> <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/distant-planets-atmospheres-revealed">done</a> <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/first-picture-sun-like-star-multiple-exoplanets-astronomy-planets">before</a>, but for only about 20 planets total (<em>SN: 11/13/08; SN: 3/14/13; SN: 7/22/20</em>).</p>



<p>“In every area of exoplanet discovery, nature has been very generous,” says MIT astrophysicist Sara Seager, who was not involved in the JWST discovery. “This is the one area where nature didn’t really come through.”</p>



<p>In 2017, astronomers discovered HIP 65426 b and took a direct image of it using an instrument on the Very Large Telescope in Chile. But because that telescope is on the ground, it can’t see all the light coming from the exoplanet. Earth’s atmosphere absorbs a lot of the planet’s infrared wavelengths — exactly the wavelengths JWST excels at observing. The space telescope observed the planet on July 17 and July 30, capturing its glow in four different infrared wavelengths.</p>



<p>“These are wavelengths of light that we’ve never ever seen exoplanets in before,” Hinkley says. “I’ve literally been waiting for this day for six years. It feels amazing.”</p>



<p>Pictures in these wavelengths will help reveal how planets formed and what their atmospheres are made of.</p>



<p>“Direct imaging is our future,” Seager says. “It’s amazing to see the Webb performing so well.”</p>



<p>While the team has not yet studied the atmosphere of HIP 65426 b in detail, it did <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.00620">report the first spectrum</a> — a measurement of light in a range of wavelengths — of an object orbiting a different star. The spectrum allows a deeper look into the object’s chemistry and atmosphere, astronomer Brittany Miles of UC Santa Cruz and colleagues reported September 1 at arXiv.org.</p>



<p>That object is called VHS 1256 b. It’s as heavy as 20 Jupiters, so it may be more like a transition object between a planet and a star, called a brown dwarf, than a giant planet. JWST found evidence that the amounts of carbon monoxide and methane in the atmosphere of the orb are out of equilibrium. That means the atmosphere is getting mixed up, with winds or currents pulling molecules from lower depths to its top and vice versa. The telescope also saw signs of <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/brown-dwarf-sand-cloud-atmosphere-space">sand clouds</a>, a common feature in brown dwarf atmospheres (<em>SN: 7/8/22</em>).</p>



<p>“This is probably a violent and turbulent atmosphere that is filled with clouds,” Hinkley says.</p>



<p>HIP 65426 b and VHS 1256 b are unlike anything we see in our solar system. They’re more than three times the distance of Uranus from their stars, which suggests they formed in a totally different way from more familiar planets. In future work, astronomers hope to use JWST to image smaller planets that sit closer to their stars.</p>



<p>“What we’d like to do is get down to study Earths, wouldn’t we? We’d really like to get that first image of an Earth orbiting another star,” Hinkley says. That’s probably out of JWST’s reach — Earth-sized planets are still too small see. But a Saturn? That may be something JWST could focus its sights on.&nbsp;</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/insulin-longevity-aging-ant-queens">A clever molecular trick extends the lives of these ant queens</a></h4>

              
                <p>For some ant queens, the secret to long life might be a self-produced insulin blocker.</p>



<p>Ant queens are famously long-lived, even though they shouldn’t be. Generally, animals that put lots of energy into reproduction sacrifice some time off their life. But ant queens produce millions of eggs and live an extraordinarily long time compared with worker ants that don’t reproduce.</p>



<p>Now, researchers have shown how one ant species pulls off this anti-aging feat. When queens and wannabe queens of the species <em>Harpegnathos saltator</em> gear up to reproduce, a part of what’s called the insulin signaling pathway <a href="http://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.abm8767">gets blocked</a>, slowing aging, the researchers report in the Sept. 2 <em>Science</em>. That molecular pathway has long been implicated in aging in mammals, including humans.</p>





<p>“There’s been a need to understand why queens, or reproductives, in social insects can live for so amazingly long,” says Marc Tatar, a biologist at Brown University in Providence, R.I., who was not involved with the study. Some ant species have queens that survive 30 times as long as their workers. Other social insects such as bees and termites also have long-lived queens.</p>



<p>In a rare behavior for ants, when a queen <em>H. saltator </em>dies, some female workers begin competing in duels for <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/blog/science-ticker/insect-queens-sterilize-workers-similar-chemical">the chance to replace her</a> (<em>SN: 1/17/14</em>). These hopeful royals develop ovaries, start laying eggs and transition into queenlike forms called gamergates. When a worker transitions to a gamergate, her life span becomes five times as long as it was. But if she doesn’t end up becoming queen and reverts back to a worker, her life span shortens again.</p>



<p>The researchers exploited this behavior to investigate the molecular underpinnings of anti-aging in these ants. <em>H. saltator </em>gamergates, it turns out, extend their life spans by taking advantage of a split in the insulin signaling pathway, the chain of chemical reactions that drive insulin’s effects on the body. One branch of this pathway is involved with reproduction, while the other is implicated in aging.</p>



<p>“Insulin comes with our life — [after] we eat, we have high insulin,” says Hua Yan, a biologist at the University of Florida in Gainesville. “But a constant high level of insulin is bad for longevity.”</p>



<p>Examining patterns of gene activity, Yan and colleagues found that gamergates have more active insulin genes than regular worker ants and, as a result, have increased metabolic activity and ovary development. But the secret sauce protecting the ants from the insulin’s aging effects appears to be a molecule called Imp-L2, which blocks the branch of the insulin pathway linked to aging, experiments showed. The branch involved in reproduction, however, remains active.</p>



<p>“What we don’t understand is how Imp-L2 can act on one aspect of the pathway and not on the other,” says study coauthor Claude Desplan, a developmental biologist at New York University.</p>



<p>These results represent a leap forward in our understanding of extreme social insect longevity, the researchers say, while also showcasing an anti-aging evolutionary adaptation that hasn’t been seen in the wild before.</p>

<p><a href="https://bookshop.org/a/21798/9781538754153">The Milky Way</a><br><em>Moiya McTier</em><br><em>Grand Central Publishing, $27</em></p>



<p>Meet the Milky Way in its own words.</p>



<p><em>The Milky Way: An Autobiography of Our Galaxy</em> takes a tour of our home in the cosmos from an unexpected perspective. Astrophysicist and folklorist Moiya McTier presents herself not as the author, but as the lucky human vessel through which the Milky Way has chosen to tell its story. Then she lets the galaxy take it away, with humor, heart and a huge dose of snark.</p>





<p>The book alternates chapters between science and mythology, reflecting McTier’s dual specialties (her bio says she was the first student in Harvard University’s history to study both). “Many of you don’t realize this, but myths were some of your species’ first attempt at scientific inquiry,” the Milky Way tells us.</p>



<p>The Milky Way is telling its story now because it’s sick of being ignored. Once upon a time, humans looked to the glittering smudge of stars in the sky for insight into when to plant crops or avoid floods. We told stories about the Milky Way’s importance in the origin and fate of the world.</p>



<p>Our galaxy ate it up: For an entity that spends most of its time ripping up smaller galaxies and watching its own stars die, “your stories made me feel loved and needed and, perhaps for the first time in my long existence, more helpful than I was ruinous.” But in the last few centuries, technology and light pollution have pulled humankind away. “At first, I thought it was just a phase,” the Milky Way says. “Then I remembered … that several hundred years is actually a long time for humans.”</p>





<p>So the Milky Way decided to remind us why it’s so important. Its autobiography covers big-picture scientific questions about galaxies, like where they come from (“When a gas cloud loves itself very much,” the Milky Way explains, “it hugs itself extra tight, and after a few hundred million years, a baby galaxy is born. Leave the storks out of it, please.”). It also gets into what galaxies are made of, how they interact with other galaxies, and how they live and die. The book then zooms out to cover the origins and <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/book-end-everything-explores-ways-universe-could-perish">possible ends of the universe</a>, mysteries like dark matter and dark energy, and even humankind’s search for other intelligent life (<em>SN: 8/4/20</em>).</p>



<p>The author takes pains to explain scientific jargon and the technical tools that astronomers use to study the sky. A lot of popular astronomy writing glosses over how astronomers think about cosmic distance or exactly what a spectrum is, but not this book. If you’ve ever been curious about these insider details, <em>The Milky Way</em> has you covered.</p>



<p>McTier’s version of our home galaxy is heavily anthropomorphized. The Milky Way is brash, vain and arrogant in a way that may hide a secret insecurity. Its central black hole is characterized as the physical embodiment of the galaxy’s shame and regrets, a source of deep existential angst. And its relationship with the Andromeda galaxy is like a long-term, long-distance romance, with each galaxy sending stars back and forth as love notes <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/andromeda-milky-way-galaxy-black-hole-collision-simulation">until the two can eventually merge</a> (<em>SN: 3/05/21</em>).</p>



<p>This could have felt gimmicky. But McTier’s efforts to make the metaphors work while keeping the science accurate and up-to-date made the premise endearing and entertaining.</p>



<p>I laughed twice on Page 1. I learned a new word on Page 2. I dog-eared the endnotes early on because it became instantly clear I would want to read every one. I read this book while traveling in rural upstate New York, where the sky is much clearer than at my home outside of Boston. <em>The Milky Way</em> reminded me to look up and appreciate my home in the universe, just like its narrator wanted. </p>

              <h4><a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2022/09/plos-cheers-the-ostp-memorandum/">PLOS cheers the OSTP memorandum “Ensuring Free, Immediate, and Equitable Access to Federally Funded Research”</a></h4>

              
                <p>We were thrilled last Thursday to read Dr. Alondra Nelson&rsquo;s United States Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP) <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/08-2022-OSTP-Public-Access-Memo.pdf">memorandum</a> on the subject of &ldquo;Ensuring Free, Immediate, and Equitable Access to Federally Funded Research.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>



<p>The vision expressed in the memo represents a tremendous step toward the future of scientific research communication that PLOS <a href="https://plos.org/about/">has been working toward</a> since our founding in 2001. It truly is a watershed moment for the US research community and everyone who has a stake in scientific communications.</p>



<p>The memo requires US federal granting bodies to develop and implement new policies making all tax-payer funded scholarly research and underlying raw data freely and publicly available without embargo by 2026. Importantly, the guidance applies to all federal agencies with R&amp;D expenditures, regardless of budget size or the subject area of the research being funded.</p>



<p>In the coming weeks and months, we will consider and expand on what this memo, and other policy advancements around the world, mean for Open Scholarship and Open Science, and how we can all play our part.&nbsp;</p>



<p>For now, we want to confirm that <strong>publishing in any</strong> <strong>PLOS journal already meets or exceeds the requirements outlined in the OSTP memo.</strong> Here&rsquo;s how:</p>



<p></p>



<h2>Free public access to scholarly publications</h2>



<hr class="wp-block-separator">



<p class="has-text-align-right"><em>&ldquo;Federal agencies should update or develop new public access plans for ensuring&hellip;that all peer-reviewed scholarly publications authored or coauthored by individuals or institutions resulting from federally funded research </em><strong><em>are made freely available and publicly accessible by default in agency-designated repositories without any embargo or delay after publication.</em></strong><em>&rdquo;</em> (emphasis in the original) p. 3</p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator">



<p>PLOS is and always has been a fully Open Access publisher. Everything we publish is available under a <a href="https://plos.org/open-science/open-access/">CC BY</a> copyright license. That means the research is not only publicly accessible&mdash;it&rsquo;s also freely available for redistribution, remixing, and reuse.</p>



<p>PLOS began publishing journals precisely to provide venues that would lead this kind of transformation in science communication. You might even say <a href="https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pbio.0000036">we were born for this</a> moment. We helped catalyze a change in scholarly publishing when we launched <em>PLOS Biology</em> in 2003. Since then, we&rsquo;ve expanded our portfolio to include <a href="https://plos.org/your-journal-options/">12 journals</a> serving researchers in all areas of science and medicine to make all high quality and impactful research openly accessible to everyone.</p>



<h2>No delays or embargos</h2>



<hr class="wp-block-separator">



<p class="has-text-align-right"><em><em>&ldquo;OSTP recommends that federal agencies&hellip;make publications and their supporting data resulting from federally funded research publicly accessible without an <strong>embargo on their free and public release</strong>.&rdquo; </em>(emphasis in the original) p. 1</em></p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator">



<p>At PLOS, everything we publish is freely available for anyone, anywhere in the world to read, cite, share, or iterate upon, right from the very start.</p>



<p>We&rsquo;ve always believed knowledge should be available to all without barriers. PLOS publishes research that meets the highest standards of methodological and ethical rigor, without restrictions, delays, or reader fees. We also support preprint-posting across each of our journals so you can make your work available as soon as you&rsquo;re ready.</p>



<h2>Machine readable</h2>



<hr class="wp-block-separator">



<p class="has-text-align-right">&ldquo;<em>Federal agencies should aim &ldquo;to maximize equitable reach of public access to peer-reviewed scholarly publications, including by providing free online access to peer-reviewed scholarly publications in formats that allow for machine-readability.&rdquo;</em> p. 3-4</p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator">



<p>All PLOS articles and published peer reviews are fully machine readable, indexed, and archived to enhance discoverability, and enable further parsing, cross-referencing, processing, and analysis. Plus, our entire corpus is available for download through the <a href="https://github.com/PLOS/allofplos">AllofPLOS</a> project in order to facilitate meta-analysis of the research we publish, and meta-research into publishing patterns.</p>



<h2>Public data</h2>



<hr class="wp-block-separator">



<p class="has-text-align-right"><em>&ldquo;Scientific data underlying peer-reviewed scholarly publications resulting from federally funded research should be made freely available and publicly accessible by default at the time of publication&rdquo;</em> p. 4</p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator">



<p>Since 2014, PLOS&rsquo; <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/s/data-availability">Data Availability</a> policy has required that the raw data underlying each study we publish be made publicly available upon publication.</p>



<p>Readers rely on raw scientific data to enhance their understanding of published research. Data are key for verification, replication and reanalysis, to inform future investigations, and to inform systematic reviews or meta-analyses. Demonstrating that level of transparency with the research community signals integrity and inspires trust in return.</p>



<h2>Research integrity through metadata</h2>



<hr class="wp-block-separator">



<p class="has-text-align-right"><em>&ldquo;Federal agencies should take actions to ensure that these elements of scientific and research integrity are in place in order to strengthen public trust in federally funded science&hellip;The public should be able to identify which federal agencies support given investments in science, the scientists who conduct that research, and the extent to which peer-review was conducted.&rdquo;</em> p. 5-6</p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator">



<p>PLOS prominently displays data availability, funding, and competing interest statements on each article we publish. We use ORCID IDs to identify and distinguish individual researchers, and the CRediT classification system to describe each author&rsquo;s specific contributions to the work. DOIs and sub-DOIs make it easy to cite our articles, figures, and datasets, as well as the associated Published Peer Review History. Our partnerships, together with our archival and indexing standards enable bi-directional linking to and from each article, and its related research products on other sites, including preprints, Open Data, Open Methods, Open Code.</p>



<p></p>



<h2>Moving Open Science beyond APCs</h2>



<p>Of course, we recognize a transition to OA publication comes with many other considerations for researchers who have not done so before. The features above are embedded in our journals and publishing process to make it as easy as possible for authors, and we are always working with research communities to improve.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In particular, we acknowledge Article Processing Charges (APCs) pose a barrier for many researchers and we are experimenting with new business models designed to reflect the true cost of publication, and to allocate costs more fairly, making Open Access publishing accessible to everyone.</p>



<p>PLOS already has partnerships with many US institutions to make the cost of publishing free for those researchers. Check our list of <a href="https://plos.org/resources/for-institutions/institutional-account-participants/#us">partner institutions</a> to see if your institution has an existing agreement. We are always reaching out to new institutions to expand coverage for authors.

              <h4><a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2022/09/meet-the-editor-in-chief-plos-medicine/">Meet the new Editor-in-Chief of PLOS Medicine</a></h4>

              
                <p>We are delighted to be introducing the new Editor-in-Chief of <em><a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosmedicine/?utm_id=323&amp;utm_source=website&amp;utm_medium=internal&amp;utm_campaign=323med0922&amp;utm_content=in_copy_link">PLOS Medicine</a></em>, Prof. Dr. Till B&auml;rnighausen! He brings with him a wealth of expertise and experience in the major drivers of good health, as well as interventions that can improve and support health at population level. He is committed to increasing the uptake of open science practices in the medical community, and advocates for more transparency in the process of research practice.</p>



<p>Till has kindly answered some of our burning questions about himself, his background, and what he plans to bring to <em>PLOS Medicine</em>. Get to know him a little better with this short interview.</p>



<h3>What is the specific background and expertise do you bring to <em>PLOS Medicine</em>?</h3>



<p>I originally trained as a family physician and bring research domain competence on many of the major global disease burdens &ndash; including HIV, diabetes, hypertension, and depression &ndash; to <em>PLOS Medicine</em>, paired with broad methods competence for the design and evaluation of interventions and policies that address these burdens. I have research expertise and experience in multiple disciplines, such as epidemiology, data science, economics, health systems research, and design and implementation research.</p>



<h3><br>How do you align with the Executive Editor&rsquo;s expertise and interests? And can you anticipate what will be the core of the new <em>PLOS Medicine</em> strategy you and the Executive Editor are developing?</h3>



<p>Raffaella Bosurgi (Executive Editor) and I share expertise and interests in the major biological, behavioural, social, and environmental drivers of good health, as well as the interventions and policies that can substantially boost health at the population level. I anticipate that the core of the new <em>PLOS Medicine</em> strategy will focus thematically on the most promising solutions to the massive preventable and curable disease burdens that continue to persist and increase; in particular in the world&rsquo;s resource-poorest communities and countries. </p>



<p>Major new movements in health systems worldwide &ndash; such as healthcare in everyday places, health promotion through social networks, and digital and mobile approaches to reach resource-poor and left-behind populations &ndash; require design research to create interventions and evaluation research to establish causal impact, performance, and social and economic value.<em> PLOS Medicine</em> should strive to be the first choice for researchers to publish ground-breaking research on solutions to the world&rsquo;s largest and most pressing health problems. </p>



<p>Methodologically, I anticipate that <em>PLOS Medicine</em> will focus equally strongly on high-quality clinical evidence, such as from efficacy trials and large clinical cohorts, and on population evidence, such as from health policy experiments and quasi-experiments. Last but not least I anticipate that <em>PLOS Medicine</em> will focus on the important and complex relationships between human health and the environment and how both can thrive in respect of each other in order to build more resilient societies and futures.</p>



<h3><br>What does PLOS&rsquo; vision for Open Science mean to you?</h3>



<p>Part of the PLOS family of journals, <em>PLOS Medicine</em> has been at the forefront of the Open Science movement since its inception in 2004. As this movement advances, <em>PLOS Medicine</em> has an opportunity to further broaden its &lsquo;openness&rsquo;. As Editor-in-Chief, I will work with the Executive Editor and the <em>PLOS Medicine</em> leadership team, editorial board, reviewers and authors to consider initiatives for open engagement of other societal actors in publishing scientific articles on health and medicine. For instance, the beneficiaries of findings published in the journal could be invited comment, providing novel perspectives on the value and usefulness of a particular piece. Similarly, themes for special issues could be decided in open engagement with patient representatives, health professionals, and funders of science.</p>



<p><br><em>PLOS Medicine</em> is already strongly and visibly committed to open peer review and open data. It could further boost the &lsquo;openness&rsquo; of the knowledge that it publishes by trialling and implementing novel approaches to sharing documentation of the processes that have generated data and the analytical code that has turned data into results.</p>



<h3><br>What developments are occurring in Medicine or your field of expertise that excite you at this time?</h3>



<p>I am excited by the promise (and fearful of the perils) of &lsquo;high tech&rsquo; for health promotion, and disease prevention and treatment. For interventions: digital approaches for health literacy and personalized health promotion, contextual social marketing for healthy lives, and for linking patients for mutual and real-time treatment support. For insight, such as wearables and sensors to measure exposures and outcomes in far greater detail and with far greater time resolution than in traditional visit-based studies. I am also excited by the potential of &lsquo;low tech&rsquo; for population health. Things such as salt reduction and substitution to reduce blood pressure, green and blue space exposure to boost mental resilience and health, and delayed prescriptions to reduce antibiotic use and antimicrobial resistance.</p>



<h3><br>What is a topic in medical research you wish you knew more about?</h3>



<p>Network science. In particular how we can better use physical, biological, cognitive, and social network information to understand more deeply what drives population health &ndash; and how we can leverage networks for health interventions and policies.</p>



<h3><br>What is a fun fact about you?</h3>



<p>My favourite past time activities are skiing and playing old-fashioned board games with our kids, Amelie, Elias and Leo.</p>



<h3><br>What&rsquo;s on your reading list for the <em>PLOS Medicine</em> community?</h3>



<p>This summer I am reading three books. <em>A shot to save the world</em> by Gregory Zuckerman, which describes the race to develop a COVID-19 vaccine. I expect this will hold some important lessons on developing future systems to respond to new threats to population health. <em>Theory and reality</em> by Peter Godfrey-Smith, a wonderfully written survey of the major intellectual movements that have conceived science, and how they have challenged each other. I am rereading this book. <em>The art of gathering</em> by Priya Parker, which includes many recommendations for making meetings matter more. This book seems particularly timely as we are emerging from the COVID-related restrictions to our gatherings and have an opportunity to redesign how we meet in the coming years.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/long-covid-epstein-barr-link-risk">Who has the highest risk of long COVID? It’s complicated</a></h4>

              
                <p>For millions of people, COVID-19 doesn’t end with a negative test. Weeks or months after traces of the virus disappear from noses and throats, symptoms can persist or come back. New ones might pop up and stick around for months. People suffering from long COVID are unwillingly in it for the long haul — and it’s still unclear who’s at the highest risk for the condition. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Researchers don’t yet have an <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/long-covid-definition-symptoms-treatment-coronavirus">official definition for long COVID</a>, and its symptoms are wide-ranging (<em>SN: 7/29/22</em>). Some people struggle with extreme fatigue that interferes with their daily lives. Others can’t concentrate or struggle with memory amid thick brain fog. Still others have organ damage or a persistent cough and difficulty breathing.</p>





<p>“There are a variety of different kinds of ways that people can have long COVID. It’s not just the one thing,” says Leora Horwitz, an internal medicine physician at New York University Langone Health. “That’s what makes it so hard to study.”</p>



<p>This spectrum of symptoms makes pinning down who’s at high risk for long-term health problems from the disease especially hard. Some post-COVID conditions may stem from virus-induced damage or from the stress of being hospitalized with severe disease. In other cases, the body’s own immune response to the virus could drive the damage. Or the virus may be hiding somewhere in the body, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/covid-19-immunity-antibodies-persist-six-months-coronavirus">possibly the gut</a>, helping symptoms to persist (<em>SN: 11/24/20</em>). Different causes may have different risk groups, says Hannah Davis, cofounder of the Patient-Led Research Collaborative, a research and advocacy group studying long COVID.</p>



<p>There are some broad hints about who’s at risk. Studies suggest that <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/03007995.2022.2081454">women are more likely than men to have lingering symptoms</a>. COVID-19 patients with <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-021-01292-y">more than five symptoms in the first week of infection</a> or <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-022-30836-0">preexisting health conditions such as asthma</a> may be more likely to develop long COVID. Age also appears to be a risk factor, though results are mixed regarding <a href="https://www.gavi.org/vaccineswork/nine-factors-could-boost-your-risk-long-covid">whether the burden falls on older people or middle-aged people</a>. Populations that were disproportionally hit by COVID-19 overall — including Black and Hispanic people — may similarly face disparities for long COVID. And while vaccination seems to protect people from developing long COVID, Horwitz says, it’s still unclear by how much.</p>



<p>Age is a risk factor for severe COVID-19, and the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention lists <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/hcp/clinical-care/underlyingconditions.html">more than 30 health problems</a>, including cancer and lung disease, that also raise the risk. “So many researchers assume that those [risk factors] will be the same for long COVID and there’s no scientific basis for that,” Davis says. There are many more that researchers could be missing when it comes to long COVID.</p>



<p>Using health records and exams, and knowledge of ailments with symptoms similar to long COVID, experts are on the hunt for those risk factors. &nbsp;</p>



<h4>Examining health</h4>



<p>When it comes to getting a better handle on who’s at risk for long COVID — which also goes by the wonky alias Post-Acute Sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection — electronic health records may hold important clues.</p>



<p>Horwitz is part of the U.S. National Institutes of Health’s RECOVER initiative that <a href="https://recovercovid.org/">aims to understand the long-term impacts</a> of COVID-19. One arm of the study involves mining millions of electronic health records to find potential patterns.</p>



<p>Studying millions of these records should pinpoint potential risk factors that are rare in the population overall but perhaps more common for people with long COVID, Horwitz says. “That’s hard even in a cohort study of thousands.”</p>



<p>But health records aren’t perfect: They depend on physicians logging that patients are having trouble sleeping or focusing, or that they’re exhausted. “The things people are complaining about, we’re really bad at writing down those diagnoses on the record,” Horwitz says. “So we miss that.” &nbsp;</p>



<aside class="wp-block-sciencenews-inline-related-post alignleft"><h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/sign-up-for-e-mail-updates-on-the-coronavirus-outbreak">Sign up for e-mail updates on the latest coronavirus news and research</a></h4></aside>



<p>To account for health records’ deficiencies, Horowitz and colleagues are also directly studying thousands of people. Participants answer a questionnaire every three months so that the team can identify what kinds of symptoms people have and whether they’re getting better or worse.</p>



<p>Then blood, urine, stool and saliva samples can reveal what’s happening in the body. Tests on those samples can uncover if the coronavirus is still around and causing trouble, or if the immune system has learned to attack the body itself. Participants with abnormal test results will undergo additional, targeted testing.</p>



<p>“Unlike electronic health records where it’s hit or miss, like somebody might have had a CAT scan or might not, here we say, ‘OK, you have trouble breathing. We will take a look at your lungs,’” Horwitz says. &nbsp;</p>



<p>The study includes a range of participants: adults and kids, pregnant people, those currently with COVID-19 and people who died after having the disease.</p>



<p>Some of the potential risk factors that the team is looking for include autoimmune diseases and other viral infections. The list may grow as more people join the study. “We’re trying to balance the fishing versus making sure that we’re at least fishing for things that could be in the water,” Horwitz says.</p>



<p>Among short supply, though, are people who never caught the virus — important “controls” to highlight what’s different about people who got COVID-19.</p>



<p>So far, more than 7,000 people have signed up, and the group plans to recruit around 10,000 more. It’s a lot of data, but early results may soon start coming in.</p>



<p>“We’ll probably try to do an interim peek at those data this fall,” Horwitz says. “It’s tricky because we deliberately wanted to enroll 18,000 people so we would have enough power to really look at the things we care about. I don’t want to cheat and look too early, but we also know that there’s a lot of interest.”</p>



<h4>Striking similarities</h4>



<p>Some long COVID symptoms — brain fog, fatigue and trouble sleeping — mirror another illness: myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome, or ME/CFS. Other long COVID symptoms, such as rapid heartbeat and dizziness, fall in the category of nervous system disorders called dysautonomia. Similar symptoms could belie similar risk factors.</p>



<p>Yet potential risk factors for those conditions are largely missing from long COVID research, says Davis, who has had long COVID since March 2020. Among the possibilities that scientists are considering are things like Epstein-Barr virus, migraines and some autoimmune diseases.</p>



<p>Epstein-Barr virus could be a big one, Davis says. Infections last a lifetime because the virus can go into hiding in the body and possibly reemerge. That virus has been linked to ME/CFS for decades, though its role in the disease remains unclear, Davis says.</p>

<p>Some early hints of a link between Epstein-Barr virus and long COVID already exist. Multiple studies have found evidence in blood samples from some long COVID patients that <a href="https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.06.21.22276660v2">the immune system recently battled with Epstein-Barr virus</a>, which can cause infectious mononucleosis, a disease characterized by extreme fatigue. Other studies have <a href="https://www.cell.com/cell/fulltext/S0092-8674(22)00072-1?">found signs of the virus itself</a>. And in 2021, Davis and colleagues found that 40 out of 580 people with symptoms of long COVID who responded to an online survey reported having <a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/eclinm/article/PIIS2589-5370(21)00299-6/fulltext">a current or recent Epstein-Barr virus infection</a>. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>With ME/CFS, it’s possible that another illness caused by a different virus triggers the Epstein-Barr virus, which then causes the fatigue syndrome. Given the parallels between that condition and long COVID, some scientists are wondering if the two are actually the same disease, with the coronavirus now known as one trigger.</p>



<p>Examining health conditions that raise the chances of long COVID could provide answers for both diseases, says Nancy Klimas, an immunologist at Nova Southeastern University in Fort Lauderdale, Fla. That’s in part because researchers can more easily identify people who developed lingering symptoms after a bout of COVID-19 compared with unknown infections that may precede ME/CFS.</p>



<p>Also, “there’s a huge difference in these two fields and it’s money,” Klimas says. She now has funding from the CDC to compare long COVID patients with people who have ME/CFS. The team hopes that physical exams and specialized tests will reveal whether the two diseases are indeed the same and be a step toward understanding the mechanisms behind the lingering symptoms.</p>



<p>Still, since long COVID as a whole encompasses such a wide range of symptoms, it will take time to uncover who is at risk of what.</p>



<p>If COVID-19 were just one disease impacting the lungs, heart or brain, the research might be easier, Horwitz says. “But we have to test everything.”</p>

<h3><b><i>‘’</i></b> <b><i>What is one piece of advice you would give to reviewers as an EBM overseeing peer review ?“ </i></b></h3>
<p>Here are their replies:</p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400"><span style="font-weight: 400">“I would advise reviewers to think about how the manuscript at hand could be improved. The ultimate goal is to make published research better, such that the benefit to the public is maximized. I believe this can be achieved by being unbiased, open-minded, and thorough in assessing submitted work”. </span><strong>Dr Christiana Kartsonaki, senior statistician, Nuffield Department of Population Health, University of Oxford, UK</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Treat every manuscript like treating your own paper. It’s vital to not only point out defects, but also to appreciate merits in each piece of work. Reviewers are not just making a choice between Accept and Reject. Instead, reviewers could offer valuable suggestions that are to the point and help authors improve the quality of the paper. Reviewers are not the opponents of authors, but teachers and friends who work side-by-side”. </span><strong>Prof Guo-wei Tu, Chief Physician and Associate Professor of Critical Care Medicine, Zhongshan Hospital, Fudan University, Shanghai, China</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400"><span style="font-weight: 400">I would advise reviewers to only commit to the review process if they have the time and required expertise for the specific manuscript. It is disheartening and inconvenient when reviewers agree to handle a manuscript but then don’t return any comments or provide very little feedback to the authors. The reviewing process should be constructive for the authors and it would be more beneficial if more highly experienced scientists were engaging with this”. </span><strong>Dr Stavroula Kanoni, Lecturer in Nutrigenetics and Cardiovascular Health, William Harvey Research Institute, Barts &amp; the London Medical School, Queen Mary University of London, UK</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400"> </span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400"><span style="font-weight: 400">“All reviewers, including me, are expected to abide by the ethical guidelines for peer reviewers published by the Committee on Publication Ethics (COPE). They are expected to spend adequate time to avoid missing anything. The history of medicine cannot forget the rejection of Sir Hans Adolf Krebs’ article by a prestigious journal in 1937, where he described the discovery which led him to obtain the Nobel prize. We should not let such egregious or even minor errors at lower scales be repeated”. </span><strong>Prof Elaheh Malakan Rad, Professor of Pediatric Interventional Cardiology, Children’s Medical Center, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Iran</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400"><span style="font-weight: 400">“I would recommend reviewers pay more attention to the content of the paper and the validity of the proposed research rather than focus on the presentation. Some papers are written impeccably, but lack novelty or relevant research. I also suggest taking the right amount of time to review a paper since it is often the result of the authors&#8217; significant effort that must not be disregarded”. </span><strong>Prof Stafano Omboni, Director of the Italian Institute of Telemedicine, Italy and Professor of Cardiology, First Moscow State Medical University, Russia </strong></li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Reviewers are precious to every Journal because their judgements and comments represent an important part in the review process of a manuscript. For this reason, fulfilling the task of Reviewers requires time and dedication in terms of knowledge and engagement. Exhaustive comments received quickly help the authors progress in their research. I would hence recommend potential Reviewers to take some courses to learn how to become experts in the job. Also our Journal offers some training courses available online”. </span><strong>Dr Aldo Bonaventura, Division of Internal Medicine, Ospedale di Circolo e Fondazione Macchi in Varese, Italy</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400"> </span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400"><span style="font-weight: 400">“I would generally recommend learning how to become an expert in reviewing. This is not an easy task. There are a few training courses available online. We must be focused on both the scientific approach and the manuscript&#8217;s quality. The published data can impair clinical practice and bring suffering to our patients. We are responsible to uphold the faith of the people in public health and must be careful in decision-making to prevent any complications deteriorating our patients&#8217; quality of life”. </span><strong>Dr John Alexander Kharlamov, De Haar Research Task Force, Rotterdam, The Netherlands, and Tallinn, Estonia</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400"><span style="font-weight: 400">“The advice I would give to any reviewer is: accept reviewing a manuscript when you have specific expertise on the topic and the ability to appraise the methods and results presented critically. It is always ok to apologize and decline to review if you are unable to handle a manuscript, or because of conflict of interest. Another critical point is to try to finalize your recommendations in time. We have all been in these situations where our paper&#8217;s decision is delayed because of the one reviewer who did not complete his review. Please do not be that reviewer”. </span><strong>Dr Michael Megaly, Interventional Cardiology Fellow and Clinical Instructor Faculty, Banner University Medical Center and UA College of Medicine-Phoenix, USA</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400"><span style="font-weight: 400">“I would advise a timely and constructive review for an efficient editorial process. Sometimes, the reviewers ignore adding a note to the editor, which might help make editorial decisions”. </span><strong>Dr Gaurav Sharma, early-career researcher, Advanced Imaging Research Centre, University of Texas Southwestern Medical Centre, USA</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Remember that reviewing means being at the service of the authors. The first question a reviewer should ask themselves is whether the paper is out of scope or unsuitable for publication in that particular journal. If this is the case, do not delay your decision, as this will only harm the authors’ effort to find the right journal for their work. If the paper and journal are a good (or at least a possible) match, take the time to analyze the paper thoroughly, before making your decision and give feedback that will improve the author’s work”. </span><strong>Dr Claudio Montalto, Cardiology resident, University of Pavia, Italy and Interventional Cardiology Fellow, Oxford University Hospital NHS Trust, UK</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400"><span style="font-weight: 400">“The peer-review process is critical for publishing exciting and authentic scientific findings, and the reviewer&#8217;s role is crucial here. Reviewer&#8217;s comments are the building blocks of the editorial board&#8217;s decision. My advice to all potential reviewers is: accomplish the assignment on time; keep an unbiased approach; provide comprehensive and constructive scientific comments in a friendly manner; highlight the significance of an article you review, thereby helping the associate editor make a final decision; inform the EBM if you cannot handle or understand any specific part of the manuscript, such as statistical and bioinformatics analysis. Additionally, if needed, reviewers should enroll in various training courses available online at various journals, including those available at </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">BMC Cardiovascular Disorders</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400">, to improve the skills required for best and ethical review practice”. </span><strong>Dr Gourav Bhardwaj, senior research investigator, Carver College of Medicine, University of Iowa, USA</strong></li>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/demon-duck-mihirung-australia-bird-fossil">Ancient ‘demon ducks’ may have been undone by their slow growth</a></h4>

              
                <p>Giant flightless birds called mihirungs were the biggest birds to ever stride across what is now Australia. The animals, which weighed up to hundreds of kilograms, died out about 40,000 years ago. Now researchers might have a better idea why.</p>



<p>The birds may have grown and reproduced <a href="https://anatomypubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ar.25047">too slowly to withstand</a> pressures from humans’ arrival on the continent, researchers report August 17 in the<em> Anatomical Record</em>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Mihirungs are sometimes called “demon ducks” because of their great size and close evolutionary relationship with present-day waterfowl and game birds. The flightless, plant-eating birds lived for more than 20 million years.</p>





<p>Over that time, some species evolved into titans. Take Stirton’s thunderbird (<em>Dromornis stirtoni</em>). It lived about 7 million years ago, stood 3 meters tall and could exceed 500 kilograms in weight, making it the largest-known mihirung and a contender for the largest bird ever to live.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Most research on mihirungs has been on their anatomy and evolutionary relationships with living birds. Little is known about the animals’ biology, such as how long they took to grow and mature, says Anusuya Chinsamy-Turan, a paleobiologist at the University of Cape Town in South Africa.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So Chinsamy-Turan and colleagues at Flinders University in Adelaide, Australia took samples from 20 fossilized leg bones of<em> D. stirtoni</em>, from animals of varying life stages.&nbsp;</p>

<p>“Even after millions of years of fossilization, the microscopic structure of fossil bones generally remains intact,” and it can be used to decipher important clues about extinct animals’ biology, Chinsamy-Turan says.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The team examined the thin bone slices under a microscope, detailing the presence or absence of growth marks. These marks provide information on how fast the bone grew while the birds were alive.&nbsp;</p>



<p><em>D. stirtoni</em> took 15 years or more to reach full size, the team found. It probably became sexually mature a few years before that, based on the timing of a shift from rapidly growing bone to a slower-growing form that’s thought to be associated with reaching reproductive age.&nbsp;</p>



<p>These results differ from the team’s <a href="https://www.mdpi.com/1424-2818/13/5/219/htm">earlier analysis</a> of the bones of another mihirung, <em>Genyornis newtoni</em>. That species — the last-known mihirung — was less than half the size of <em>D. stirtoni</em>. It lived as recently as about 40,000 years ago and was a contemporary of the continent’s earliest human inhabitants. <em>G. newtoni</em> grew up much faster than its giant relative, reaching adult size in one to two years and growing a bit more in the following years and possibly reproducing then.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This difference in how fast mihirung species that were separated by millions of years developed may have been an evolved response to Australia developing a drier, more variable climate over the last few million years, the researchers say. When resources are unpredictable, growing and reproducing quickly can be advantageous.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Even so, that seeming pep in the developmental step of more recent mihirungs was still slower than that of the emus they lived alongside. Emus grow up quickly, reaching adult size in less than a year and reproducing not long after, laying large numbers of eggs.</p>



<p>This difference may explain why <em>G. newtoni</em> went extinct shortly after hungry humans arrived in Australia, yet emus continue to thrive today, the team says. Even though over millions of years, mihirungs as a group seem to have adapted to growing and reproducing quicker than they used to, it wasn’t enough to survive the arrival of humans, who probably ate the birds and their eggs, the researchers conclude.</p>



<p>“Slowly growing animals face dire consequences in terms of their reduced ability to recover from threats in their environments,” Chinsamy-Turan says.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The scientists’ research on other giant, extinct, flightless birds thought to have met their end thanks to humans — such as the <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/bones-reveal-what-it-was-grow-dodo">dodos of Mauritius</a> (<em>Raphus cucullatus</em>) and the largest of Madagascar’s elephant birds (<em>Vorombe titan</em>) — shows that they too grew relatively slowly (<em>SN</em><em>: 8/29/17</em>).&nbsp;</p>



<p>“It is very interesting to see this pattern repeating again and again with many large, flightless bird groups,” says Thomas Cullen, a paleoecologist at Carleton University in Ottawa who was not involved with the new study.</p>



<p>Modern ratite birds seem to be the exception in their ability to handle similar pressures, he says. Other ratites besides emus that have survived until the present day — such as cassowaries and ostriches — also grow and reproduce quickly (<em>SN: 4/25/14</em>).</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/disputed-photon-ring-supermassive-black-hole-image-eht">Physicists dispute a claim of detecting a black hole’s ‘photon ring’</a></h4>

              
                <p>The first image of a black hole may conceal treasure — but physicists disagree about whether it’s been found.</p>



<p>A team of scientists say they’ve unearthed a photon ring, a thin halo of light around the supermassive black hole in the galaxy M87. If real, the photon ring would provide a new probe of the black hole’s intense gravity. But other scientists dispute the claim. Despite multiple news headlines suggesting the photon ring has been found, many physicists remain unconvinced.</p>





<p>Unveiled in 2019 by scientists with the Event Horizon Telescope, or EHT, the <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/black-hole-first-picture-event-horizon-telescope">first image of a black hole</a> revealed a doughnut-shaped glow from hot matter swirling around the black hole’s dark silhouette (<em>SN: 4/10/19</em>). But according to Einstein’s general theory of relativity, a thinner ring should be superimposed on that thick doughnut. This ring is produced by photons, or particles of light, that orbit close to the black hole, slung around by the behemoth’s gravity before escaping and zinging toward Earth.</p>



<p>Thanks to this circumnavigation, the photons should provide “a fingerprint of gravity,” more clearly revealing the black hole’s properties, says astrophysicist Avery Broderick of the University of Waterloo and the Perimeter Institute for Theoretical Physics in Canada. He and his colleagues, a subset of scientists from the EHT collaboration, used a new method to <a href="https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ac7c1d">tease out that fingerprint</a>, they report in the Aug. 10 <em>Astrophysical Journal</em>.</p>



<p>Creating images with EHT <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/event-horizon-telescope-black-hole-picture">isn’t a simple point-and-shoot affair</a> (<em>SN: 4/10/19</em>). Researchers stitch together data from EHT’s squad of observatories scattered across the globe, using various computational techniques to reconstruct an image. Broderick and colleagues created a new black hole image assuming it featured both a diffuse emission and a thin ring. On three out of four days of observations, the data better matched an image with the added thin ring than one without the ring.</p>



<p>But that method has drawn harsh criticism. “The claim of a photon ring detection is preposterous,” says physicist Sam Gralla of the University of Arizona in Tucson.</p>



<p>A main point of contention: The photon ring is brighter than expected, emitting around 60 percent of the light in the image. According to predictions, it should be more like 20 percent. “That’s a giant red flag,” says physicist Alex Lupsasca of Vanderbilt University in Nashville. More light should come from the black hole’s main glowing doughnut than from the thin photon ring.</p>



<p>This unexpected brightness, Broderick and colleagues say, occurs because some of the light from the main glow gets lumped in with the photon ring. So the ring’s apparent brightness doesn’t depend only on the light coming from the ring. The researchers note that the same effect appeared when testing the method on simulated data.</p>



<p>But that mishmash of purported photon ring light with other light doesn’t make for a very convincing detection, critics say. “If you want to claim that you’ve seen a photon ring, I think you have to do a better job than this,” says astrophysicist Dan Marrone of the University of Arizona, a member of the EHT collaboration who was not a coauthor on the new paper.</p>



<p>The new result suggests only that an added thin ring gives a better match to the data, Marrone says, not whether that shape is associated with the photon ring. So it raises the question of whether scientists are seeing a photon ring at all, or just picking out an unrelated structure in the image.</p>



<p>But Broderick argues that the features of the ring — the fact that its size and location are as expected and are consistent day-to-day — support the photon ring interpretation.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, in a similar, independent analysis, Gralla and physicist Will Lockhart, also of the University of Arizona, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.09989">find no evidence for a photon ring,</a> they report in a paper submitted August 22 at arXiv.org. Their analysis differed from Broderick and colleagues’ in part because it limited how bright the photon ring could be.</p>



<p>To convincingly detect the photon ring, some scientists propose adding <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/new-telescopes-could-help-spot-photon-ring-black-hole-ever-imaged">telescopes in space</a> to the EHT’s crew of observatories (<em>SN: 3/18/20</em>). The farther apart the telescopes in the network are, the finer details they may be able to pick out — potentially including the photon ring.</p>



<p>“If there were a photon ring detection,” Lupsasca says, “that would be the best thing in physics this year, if not for many years.”</p>

But how do the various environments and ever changing conditions faced by these small cetacean impact their genetic diversity and have they adapted to their specific environment? This <em>BMC Ecology and Evolution </em>seascape genomic study uses genome wide and environmental data at the population level to look at selective pressure, adaptive population structure and population diversity in the common dolphin in southern Australia. Four key variables are identified to have an impact on genomic variation:  sea surface temperature, primary productivity, current velocity and salinity. These data can in turn help to inform on the impact of specific factors such as pollution and assist in the conservation efforts. This study lead to the identification of five populations of common dolphin to be considered as priority for population management and conservation. As a near top predator, dolphins are key players in their environments and a vital part of the food chain. Thus, impacts from anthropogenic activities such as fisheries or climatic disruptions on dolphin populations could have long standing effects on the whole of the marine ecosystem.</p>

Glyphosate is a weak organic acid, often supplemented by adjuvants to increase its herbicidal properties. It is generally composed of an isopropylamine salt and a surfactant that is toxic to humans. Upon entrance into the body, Glyphosate is absorbed through the cell membrane and enters the bloodstream eventually spreading to the tissues and organs before being excreted by the body, primarily through urination and defecation.  Primary exposure to Glyphosate is through the skin and respiratory system while using herbicides and it has been linked to various illnesses, especially respiratory system afflictions. This <em>BMC Public Health </em>longitudinal pre-post study was conducted in maize farmer in Thailand using information from questionnaires, urine, blood samples and lung function assessment a day before and a day after glyphosate usage. As expected, exposure to glyphosate had negative impacts on oxidative stress, inflammation and lung function.</p>
<p>Oxidative stress can cause damage to cells and tissues and thus impact the body leading to increased inflammation. One of the by-product of oxidative damage is the accumulation of malondialdehyde (MDA). Upon oxidative stress, cells defend themselves by producing antioxidants in order to destroy damaging free radicals. Glutathione (GHS) plays a vital role in this process and acts to protect cells from oxidative stress. Glyphosate was shown to negatively impact the regulation of oxidative stress at different levels as exposure to glyphosate was shown to lead to a significant increase in the level of serum MDA and oxidative stress as well as a significant decrease in serum level of GHS. Furthermore, a statistically significant increase in inflammation was identified after glyphosate exposure as well as an increase in C-reactive protein (CRP), a key marker of inflammation which increases upon tissue injury, causes monocyte activation as well as the generation of reactive oxygen species and activation of complement. Last but not least, lung function was significantly decreased after application of glyphosate.</p>
<p>This study focused on the short term effects of acute exposure thus further studies on the long-term effect of glyphosate exposure are warranted.</p>

<p>Despite the popularity of microbiome studies, little is known about the impact of the presence of bacterial DNA in human blood and the risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) mortality. The association between chronic diseases and CVD has been extensively studied and a number of risk factors are known to be associated an increase in CVD mortality such as tobacco use, obesity, diet, physical activity, history of heart diseases etc… In this <em>BMC Cardiovascular Disorders</em> case-cohort study spanning over nearly 10 years, blood samples from men of a mean age of 70 were collected and their microbiome analysed in order to investigate a putative association with CVD mortality. Over 80% of the blood samples collected contained bacterial DNA from a whole range of bacteria originating from the gut, skin, oral cavity or the environment. Three genera were significantly associated with CVD mortality but the two most prevalent genera isolated, <em>Streptococcus</em> and <em>Staphylococcus</em> were not and are part of the commensal microbiota.  The presence of two genera in blood, <em>Kocuria</em> and <em>Enhydrobacter</em>, was associated with an increased CVD mortality whereas it was the opposite for the third genera, <em>Paracoccus</em>. Interestingly, these correlations were identified independently of other know health and lifestyle risk factors for CVD mortality. This study reflects on the risk through a lifetime as it looks at older men and it will be useful to inform on of which genera to pursue in future research projects.</p>

This condition was traditionally diagnosed upon observation of an increase in blood pressure and high level of proteins in urine. Recent studies have found an association between temperature and the risk of preeclampsia. Indeed, it has now been shown that the risk of preeclampsia increases for women who have conceived in warmth months and delivered in cold months based on the study of seasonal or monthly temperature data. In this <em>BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth</em> study, the effect of short-term temperature exposure on the risk of preeclampsia was investigated using daily temperature data. The authors reported that there was a significantly larger number of hospital admissions for preeclampsia on cold days than on hot ones. Indeed, the highest number of admissions to hospital for preeclampsia was observed on days where the mean temperature was lower than 10°C. Furthermore, the lowest number of admissions to hospital for preeclampsia was on days where the mean temperature was higher than 30°C. The lag effect of low temperature preeclampsia risk was also identified as a significant risk factor.  Thus the recommendation was that in low temperature, pregnant women should stay warm and pay attention to their blood pressure and go to the hospital if it raises. This information could be used in order for governments to increase publicity on the impact of low temperature on the risk of preeclampsia and thus help to reduce that risk.</p>

<p><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-12970" src="https://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2022/08/3-300x190.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="190" srcset="https://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2022/08/3-300x190.jpg 300w, https://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2022/08/3.jpg 399w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />Estuaries are changing environments characterised by large variations in salinity levels due to the mixture of marine and fluvial waters. Thus their inhabitants have had to develop strategies to adapt to such fluctuations. This <em>BMC Genomics</em> study set out to unravel the molecular mechanism responsible for the strong salinity tolerance of <em>Scatophagus argus</em>, the spotted cat fish, a recently developed mariculture specie by looking at differentially expressed proteins. They uncovered that cellular ion regulation transport as well as ATP synthesis are key players in the osmoregulatory process of its specialised gills that act as the main osmoregulatory organ. These gills have developed different strategies to enable the fish to adapt to different salinity level. Under hypo saline conditions, Na+ efflux is maintained through Na+-K+-ATPase (NKA) increased activity leading to a reduction in the intracellular osmotic pressure. Simultaneously, an increased NKA internalisation prevents excessive ion loss. Upon hypersaline stress, excess ions are excreted through active transport and reduced NKA activity resulting in an increased intracellular osmotic pressure. Thus this fish has developed different osmoregulatory strategies in order to handle hypoosmotic as well as hyperosmotic stresses and thus adapt to an environment subject to large fluctuations in salinity levels. These result provide valuable insights on <em>Scatophagus argus</em> and the strategies used by estuarine fishes that should prove helpful to the expansion of commercial aquaculture.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/covid-infection-471-days-coronavirus-evolution-variants">The curious case of the 471-day coronavirus infection</a></h4>

              
                <p>As <a href="https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#variant-proportions">omicron subvariant BA.5</a> continues to drive the coronavirus’ spread in the United States, I’ve been thinking about what could come next. Omicron and its offshoots have been <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/omicron-delta-coronavirus-covid-variant-spread-speed.">topping the variant charts</a> since last winter. Before that, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/covid-delta-variant-mutations-coronavirus-life-cycle-2021">delta reigned</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Scientists have a few ideas for how new variants emerge. One involves people with persistent infections — people who test positive for the virus over a prolonged period of time. I’m going to tell you about the curious case of a person infected with SARS-CoV-2 for at least 471 days and what can happen when infections roil away uncontrolled.&nbsp;</p>





<p>That lengthy infection first came onto epidemiologist Nathan Grubaugh&#8217;s radar in the summer of 2021. His team had been analyzing coronavirus strains in patient samples from Yale New Haven Hospital when Grubaugh spotted something he had seen before. Known only as B.1.517, this version of the virus never got a name like delta or omicron, nor rampaged through communities quite like its infamous relatives.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Instead, after springing up somewhere in North America in early 2020, B.1.517 tooled around in a handful of regions around the world, even sparking an outbreak in Australia. But after April 2021, B.1.517 seemed to sputter, one of the who-knows-how-many viral lineages that flare up and then eventually fizzle.&nbsp;</p>



<p>B.1.517 might have been long forgotten, shouldered aside by the latest variant to stake a claim in local communities. “And yet we were still seeing it,” Grubaugh says. Even after B.1.517 had petered out across the country, his team noticed it cropping up in patient samples. The same lineage, every few weeks, like clockwork, for months.&nbsp;</p>



<p>One clue was the samples’ specimen ID. The code on the B.1.517 samples was always the same, Grubaugh’s team noticed. They had all come from a single patient.</p>



<p>That patient, a person in their 60s with a history of cancer, relapsed in November of 2020. That was right around when they first tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. After seeing B.1.517 show up again and again in their samples, Grubaugh worked with a clinician to get the patient’s permission to analyze their data.&nbsp;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed alignleft is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr"><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f9f5.png" alt="🧵" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />for our latest preprint on the intrahost evolution of SARS-CoV-2 virus in an immunocompromised individual (60s) with a history of cancer chronically infected for at least 471 days (ongoing) with consistently replicating viruses at a high viral load. 1/n<a href="https://t.co/qBNEjXTqMt">https://t.co/qBNEjXTqMt</a></p>&mdash; Chrispin Chaguza (@ChrispinChaguza) <a href="https://twitter.com/ChrispinChaguza/status/1543730086658056192?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 3, 2022</a></blockquote><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
</div></figure>



<p>Ultimately, the patient has <a href="https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.06.29.22276868v1.full">remained infected for 471 days</a> (and counting), Grubaugh, Yale postdoctoral researcher Chrispin Chaguza and their team reported last month in a preliminary study posted at medRxiv.org. Because of deteriorating health and a desire to maintain their anonymity, the patient was not willing to be interviewed, and Grubaugh has no direct contact with them.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>But all those samples collected over all those days told an incredible tale of viral evolution. Over about 15 months, at least three genetically distinct versions of the virus had rapidly evolved inside the patient, the team’s analyses suggested.</p>



<p>Each version had dozens of mutations and seemed to coexist in the patient’s body. “Honestly, if any one of these were to emerge in a population and begin transmitting, we would be calling it a new variant,” Grubaugh says.</p>



<p>That scenario is probably rare, he says. After all, lots of prolonged infections have likely occurred during the pandemic, and only a handful of concerning variants have emerged. But the work does suggest that persistent viral infections can provide a playground for speedy evolutionary experimentation — perhaps taking advantage of weakened immune systems.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Grubaugh’s work is “probably the most detailed look we’ve had at a single, persistent infection with SARS-CoV-2 so far,” says Tom Friedrich, a virologist at the University of Wisconsin–Madison, who was not involved with the work.</p>



<aside class="wp-block-sciencenews-inline-related-post alignleft"><h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/sign-up-for-e-mail-updates-on-the-coronavirus-outbreak">Sign up for e-mail updates on the latest coronavirus news and research</a></h4></aside>



<p>The study supports an earlier finding about a different immunocompromised patient — one with a persistent <a href="https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.05.25.22275533v1">omicron infection</a>. In that work, researchers documented the evolution of the virus over 12 weeks and showed that its descendant infected at least five other people.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Together, the studies lay out how such infections could potentially drive the emergence of the next omicron.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“I am pretty well convinced that people with persistent infection are important sources of new variants,” Friedrich says.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Who exactly develops these infections remains mysterious. Yes, the virus can pummel people with weakened immune systems, but “not every immunocompromised person develops a persistent infection,” says Viviana Simon, a virologist at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai who worked on the omicron infection study.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In fact, doctors and scientists have no idea how common these infections are. “We just don’t really have the numbers,” Simon says. That’s a huge gap for researchers, and something Mount Sinai’s <a href="https://icahn.mssm.edu/research/genomics/research/microbial-genomics-pathogen-surveillance">Pathogen Surveillance Program</a> is trying to address by analyzing real-time infection data.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Studying patients with prolonged infections could also tell scientists where SARS-CoV-2 evolution is heading, Friedrich says. Just because the virus evolves within a person doesn’t mean it will spread to other people. But if certain viral mutations tend to arise in multiple people with persistent infections, that could hint that the next big variant might evolve in a similar way. Knowing more about these mutation patterns could help researchers forecast what’s to come, an important step in designing future coronavirus vaccine boosters.</p>

<p>Beyond viral forecasting, Grubaugh says identifying people with prolonged infections is important so doctors can provide care. “We need to give them access to vaccines, monoclonal antibodies and antiviral drugs,” he says. Those treatments could help patients clear their infections.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But identifying persistent infections is easier said than done, he points out. Many places in the world aren’t set up to spot these infections and don’t have access to vaccines or treatments. And even when these are available, some patients opt out. The patient in Grubaugh’s study received a monoclonal antibody infusion about 100 days into their infection, then refused all other treatments. They have not been vaccinated.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Though the patient remained infectious over the course of the study, their variants never spread to the community, as far as Grubaugh knows.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And while untreated chronic infections might spawn new variants, they could emerge in other ways, too, like from animals infected with the virus, from person-to-person transmission in groups of people scientists haven’t been monitoring, or from “something else that maybe none of us has thought of yet,” he says. “SARS-CoV-2 has continued to surprise us with its evolution.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/ancient-critter-anus-saccorhytus-coronarius-evolution">This bizarre ancient critter has been kicked out of a group that includes humans</a></h4>

              
                <p>No ifs, ands or butts about it: A teeny roughly 530-million-year-old critter that lacks an anus is not, as previously thought, the oldest member of a wide-ranging animal group that includes everything from starfish to humans.</p>



<p>Despite its absent anus, <em>Saccorhytus coronarius</em> had no shortage of holes on its wrinkly potato-shaped body, including a ring of small openings around its gaping mouth. Previously, those holes had been <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/pinhead-sized-sea-creature-was-bag-mouth">identified as an early version of gill slits</a>, typically used for respiration (<em>SN: 2/3/17</em>). Gill slits are commonly found in deuterostomes, so their presence seemingly nailed the critter’s spot on the animal family tree.</p>





<p>But a new 3-D reconstruction of the half-millimeter-long species based on fossil imaging <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-022-05107-z">shows those holes are instead remnants of broken spines</a>, researchers report August 17 in <em>Nature</em>. The identification of the spines helped shift the creature into a group with arthropods and nematodes, called Ecdysozoa.</p>



<p>After millions of years, fossils can look very different from the original specimens, which <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/fossil-octopus-cephalopod-ancestor-10-arms-debate-identity">makes it challenging to identify biological features</a> (<em>SN: 3/8/22</em>). Most <em>S. coronarius</em> fossils have been flattened “like a very sad balloon that&#8217;s collapsed in on itself,” says paleontologist Philip Donoghue of the University of Bristol in England. The 3-D reconstruction brings <em>S. coronarius</em> to life — even if it does look something like an angry minion, he says.</p>



<p>Donoghue and his colleagues took X-rays of many <em>S. coronarius</em> fossils representing different stages of the organisms’ decay. The images revealed that an inner skin layer once pushed through pores and extended outward, forming spines. During fossilization, that inner layer was lost, and the holes were left behind.</p>



<p>While the spines pretty much lock <em>S. coronarius </em>into its new group, a puzzle remains: the absent anus. It’s not inherently weird —&nbsp;the absence has evolved independently in many species such as jellyfish, which vomit their food waste. But both deuterostomes and ecdysozoans usually have anuses, making <em>S. coronarius </em>an uncomfortable fit in either group.</p>



<p>Still, “if you haven&#8217;t got an anus,” Donoghue jokes, “you&#8217;re not going to be very comfortable anywhere.”</p>
