<html><body><p>Researchers rely on access to scientific data to enhance their understanding of published research, for purposes of verification, replication and reanalysis, to guide future investigations, and to inform systematic reviews or meta-analyses. Depositing data in a repository (as opposed to offering it upon request, or publishing as Supporting Information) further prevents data loss, improves discoverability, and removes barriers to replication and reuse. <strong>For all these reasons, <em>PLOS Pathogens</em> is excited to introduce a new technology solution that makes depositing data simpler and more accessible for our authors.</strong></p>



<h2>Announcing a<em> PLOS Pathogens</em> / Dryad Integration</h2>



<p>As part of a one-year trial beginning <strong>October 5, 2021</strong>, <em>PLOS Pathogens </em>authors now have the option to upload their data files directly to <a href="https://datadryad.org/stash/">Dryad Digital Repository</a> during manuscript submission or revision&mdash;without even leaving our submission system. It takes just minutes to upload a dataset and receive a unique, citable Dryad DOI. If a manuscript is accepted for publication, the associated dataset will undergo Dryad&rsquo;s screening and curatorial process and become public on the site, with links to and from the published research article. Datasets that are part of the trial will be hosted in perpetuity at no cost to authors. Thanks to a <a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2021/09/wellcome-trust-awards-plos-a-grant-to-test-ways-to-increase-sharing-and-discovery-of-research-data/">grant from the Wellcome Trust</a>, we&rsquo;ll be seeking to deeply understand the experience<a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2021/09/wellcome-trust-awards-plos-a-grant-to-test-ways-to-increase-sharing-and-discovery-of-research-data/"> </a>researchers have with this new solution, and will share what we learn with the community.</p>



<h2>Making data deposition free &amp; easy</h2>



<p>Data repositories like Dryad offer <a href="https://plos.org/open-science/open-data/#dryad">important advantages</a>, including data preservation and tracking, facilitating reproducibility, demonstrating rigor, and attracting citations. This integration offers a simple, intuitive interface that makes depositing data with Dryad a part of our authors&rsquo; normal submission workflow. The process is no more challenging than uploading data as Supporting Information, but much more effective as a vehicle for sharing. The year-long trial will show whether a more streamlined process inspires authors to take advantage of the benefits of a data repository.</p>



<h2>What comes next</h2>



<p><em>PLOS Pathogens</em> is among the first journals in our field to offer this new service. We look forward to sharing the outcomes of the <em>PLOS Pathogens</em> / Dryad Integration trial with the research and scientific publishing communities, and we welcome your feedback on your experience, both as a submitting author, and a reader referencing deposited datasets.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://gcamp6f.com/2021/10/04/large-scale-calcium-imaging-noise-levels/">Large-scale calcium imaging & noise levels</a></h4>

              
                <p>Calcium imaging based on two-photon scanning microscopy is a standard method to record the activity of neurons in the living brain. Due to the point-scanning approach, sampling speed is limited and the dwell time on a single neuron reduces with the number of recorded neurons. Therefore, one needs to trade off the number of quasi-simultaneously imaged neurons versus the shot noise level of these recordings.</p>



<p>To give an simplified example, one can distribute the laser power in space and time over 100 neurons at 30 Hz, or 1000 neurons at 3 Hz. Due to the lower sampling rate, the signal-to-noise-ratio (SNR) of the 1000 neurons will decrease as well.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"><strong>A standardized noise level</strong></p>



<p>To compare the shot noise levels across recordings, in our recent paper (<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41593-021-00895-5">Rupprecht et al., 2021</a>) we took advantage of the fact that the slow calcium signal is typically very similar between adjacent frames. Therefore, the noise level can be estimated by</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center has-medium-font-size"><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cnu++%3D+%5Cfrac%7BMedian_t+%5Cmid+%5CDelta+F%2FF_%7Bt%2B1%7D+-+%5CDelta+F%2FF_t+%5Cmid%7D%7B%5Csqrt%7Bf_r%7D%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;nu  = &#92;frac{Median_t &#92;mid &#92;Delta F/F_{t+1} - &#92;Delta F/F_t &#92;mid}{&#92;sqrt{f_r}}" class="latex" /></p>



<p>The median makes sure to exclude outliers that stem from the fast onset dynamics of calcium signals. The normalization by the square root of the frame rate <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f_r&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="f_r" class="latex" /> renders the metric comparable across datasets with different frame rates.</p>



<p>Why the square root? Because shot noise decreases with the number of sampling points <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shot_noise">with a square root dependecy</a>. The only downside of this measure is that the units seem a bit arbitrary (% for dF/F, divided by the square root of seconds), but this does not make it less useful. To compute it on a raw dF/F trace, simple use this simple one-liner in Matlab:</p>



<pre class="wp-block-preformatted has-small-font-size">noise_level = median(abs(diff(dFF_trace)))/sqrt(framerate)</pre>



<p>Or in Python:</p>



<pre class="wp-block-preformatted has-small-font-size">import numpy as np
noise_level = np.median(np.abs(np.diff(dFF_trace)))/np.sqrt(framerate)</pre>



<p>If you want to know more about this metric, check out the Methods part of our paper on more details (<a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.31.272450v2">bioRxiv</a> / <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41593-021-00895-5#Sec13">Nature Neuroscience</a>, subsection &#8220;Computation of noise levels&#8221;).</p>



<p>The metric <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cnu&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;nu" class="latex" /> comes in handy if you want to compare the shot noise levels between calcium imaging datasets and understand whether noise levels are relatively high or low. So, what is a &#8220;high&#8221; noise level?</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"><strong>Comparison of noise levels and neuron numbers across datasets</strong></p>



<p>I collected a couple of publicly available datasets (links and descriptions in the appendix of the blog post) and extracted both the numbers of simultaneously recorded neurons and the shot noise level <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cnu&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;nu" class="latex" />. Each data point stands for one animal, except for the MICrONS dataset, where each dataset stands for a separate session in the same animal.</p>

<p>As a reference, I used the Allen Brain Institute Visual Coding dataset. For excitatory neurons, typically 100-200 neurons were recording with a standard noise level of 1 (units omitted for simplicity). If you distribute the photons across an increasing number of neurons, the shot noise levels should increase with the square root of this multiple (indicated by the black line). Datasets with inhibitory neurons (de Vries et al., red) have by experimental design fewer neurons and therefore lie above the line.</p>



<p>A dataset that I recorded in zebrafish with typically 800-1500 neuron per recording lies pretty much on this line, similar to the MICrONS dataset where they used a mesoscope to record from several thousand cortical neurons simultaneously, at the cost of lower frame rate and therefore higher noise levels.</p>



<p>Two datasets acquired by Pachitariu and colleagues stands out a bit by pushing the number of simultaneously recorded neurons. In 2018, this came at the expense of increased noise levels (pink). In 2019 (a single mouse; grey), despite a dataset with ca. 20,000 simultaneously recorded neurons, the noise level was impressively low, probably due to highly optimized experiments.</p>



<p>In regular experiments, in order to mitigate possible laser-induced photodamage or problems due to overexpression of indicators, noise levels should not be maximized at the cost of physiological damage. For example, the mouse from the MICrONS dataset was later used for dense EM reconstruction; any sort of damage to the tissue, which might be invisible at first glance, could complicate subsequent diffusive penetration with heavy metals or the cutting of nanometer-thick slices. As a bottom line, there are often good reasons not to go for the highest signal yield.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"><strong>Spike inference for high noise levels</strong></p>



<p>To give an idea about the noise level, here is an example for the MICrONS dataset. Due to the noisiness of the recordings (noise level of ca. 8-9), only large transients can be reliably detected. I used <a href="https://github.com/HelmchenLabSoftware/Cascade">spike inference through CASCADE</a> to de-noise the recording. It is also clear from this example that CASCADE extracts useful information, but won&#8217;t be able to recover anything close to single-spike precision for such a noise level.</p>

<p>Above are shown the smooth inferred spike rates (orange) and also the discrete inferred spikes (black). The discrete spikes (black) are nice to look at, but due to the high noise levels, the discretization into binary spikes is mostly overfitting to noise and should be avoided for real analyses. For analyses, I would use the inferred spike rate (orange).</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>



<p>The noise level <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cnu&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;nu" class="latex" /> can be used to quantitatively compare noise levels across recordings. I hope that other people can use this noise level metric <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cnu&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;nu" class="latex" /> for their work.</p>



<p>As a note of caution, <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cnu&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;nu" class="latex" />  should never be the sole criterion for data quality. Other factors like neuropil contamination, spatial resolution, movement artifacts, potential downsides of over-expression, etc. also play important roles. Low shot noise levels is not a guarantee for anything. However, high shot noise levels on the other hand are always undesirable.</p>

<p class="has-medium-font-size"><strong>Appendix: Details about the data shown in the scatter plot</strong></p>



<p><a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41593-019-0550-9">de Vries et al. (2020; red and black)</a> describes the Allen Visual Coding Observatory dataset. It includes recordings from more than 100 mice with different transgenic backgrounds in different layers of visual-related cortices. Red dots are datasets from mice that only expressed calcium indicators in interneurons, while black dot are datasets with cortical principal neurons of different layers. The datasets are highly standardized and of low shot noise levels (standardized level of ca. 1.0), with relatively few neurons per dataset (100-200).</p>



<p>Rupprecht et al. (unpublished; green) is a small dataset in transgenic Thy-1 mice in hippocampal CA1 that I recorded as a small pilot earlier this year. The number of manually selected neurons is around 400-500, at a standardized noise level of 2.0-3.0. With virally induced expression and with higher laser power (here, I used only 20 mW), lower noise levels and higher cell counts could be easily achieved in CA1.</p>



<p><a href="https://rdcu.be/creIt">Rupprecht et al. (2021; violet)</a> is a dataset using the small dye indicator OGB-1 injected in the homolog of olfactory cortex in adult zebrafish. At low laser powers of ca. 30 mW, 800-1500 neurons were recorded simultaneously at a standardized noise level of 2.0-4.0.</p>



<p><a href="https://figshare.com/articles/dataset/Recordings_of_ten_thousand_neurons_in_visual_cortex_in_response_to_2_800_natural_images/6845348">Pachitariu et al. (2018; pink)</a> is a dataset recorded at a relatively low imaging rate (2.5 Hz), covering ca. 10,000 neurons simultaneously. The standardized noise level seems to be rather high according to my calculations.</p>



<p><a href="https://figshare.com/articles/dataset/Recording_of_19_000_neurons_across_mouse_visual_cortex_during_sparse_noise_stimuli/9505250">Pachitariu et al. (2019; black)</a> is a similar dataset that contains ca. 20,000 neurons, but at a much lower standardized noise level (4.0-5.0).</p>



<p><a href="https://www.microns-explorer.org/cortical-mm3#f-data">MICrONS et al. (2021; red)</a> is a dataset from a single mouse, each dot representing a different session. 8 imaging planes were recorded simultaneously at laser powers that would not damage the tissue, in order to preserve the brain for later slicing, with the ultimate goal to image the ultrastructure using electron microscopes. The number of simultaneously imaged neurons comes close to 10,000, resulting in a relatively high standardized noise level of 7.0-10.0.</p>



<p>The black line indicates how the noise level scales with the number of neurons. For <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=n_1+%3D+150&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="n_1 = 150" class="latex" /> neurons (Allen dataset, de Vries et al.), a standardized noise level of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cnu_1+%3D+1.0&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;nu_1 = 1.0" class="latex" /> can be assumed. For higher numbers of neurons <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=n_2&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="n_2" class="latex" />, the noise level <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cnu_2&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;nu_2" class="latex" /> scales with <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cnu_2+%3D+%5Cnu_1%2A%5Csqrt%7Bn_2%2Fn_1%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="&#92;nu_2 = &#92;nu_1*&#92;sqrt{n_2/n_1}" class="latex" />.

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/brain-implant-severe-depression-activity-stimulation">A custom brain implant lifted a woman’s severe depression</a></h4>

              
                <p>A personalized brain implant eased the crushing symptoms of a woman’s severe depression, allowing her to once again see the beauty of the world. “It’s like my lens on the world changed,” said Sarah, the research volunteer who requested to be identified by her first name only.</p>



<p>The technology, described October 4 in <em>Nature Medicine</em>, brings researchers closer to understanding how to <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/brain-electric-implants-treat-depression-closer-reality">detect and change brain activity</a> in ultraprecise ways (<em>SN: 2/10/19</em>).</p>



<p>The device was bespoke; it was built specifically for Sarah’s brain. The details of the new system may not work as a treatment for many other people, says Alik Widge, a psychiatrist and neural engineer at the University of Minnesota in Minneapolis. Still, the research is “a really significant piece of work,” he says, because it points out a way to study how brain activity goes awry in depression.</p>



<p>Researchers at the University of California, San Francisco implanted temporary thin wire electrodes into Sarah’s brain. The 36-year-old woman had suffered from severe depression for years. These electrodes allowed researchers to monitor the brain activity that corresponded to Sarah’s depression symptoms — a pattern that the researchers could use as a biomarker, a signpost of trouble to come. In Sarah’s case, a particular sign emerged: a fast brain wave called a gamma wave in her amygdala, a brain structure known to be involved in emotions.&nbsp;</p>





<p>With this biomarker in hand, the researchers then figured out where to stimulate the brain to interrupt Sarah’s distressing symptoms. A region called the ventral capsule/ventral striatum, or VC/VS, seemed to be the key. That’s not surprising; previous research suggests the region is involved with feeling good and other emotions. When researchers applied tiny jolts of electrical current to this region, Sarah’s mood improved. “We could learn the road map of Sarah’s brain in a way that we could really improve her depression symptoms,” Katherine Scangos of UCSF said in a Sept. 30 news briefing.</p>



<p>During this mapping phase of the experiment, Sarah felt joy when the right spot was stimulated. “I laughed out loud,” she said in the briefing. “This was the first time I had spontaneously laughed and smiled where it wasn’t faked or forced in five years.”</p>

<p>Surgeons then implanted a more permanent device into Sarah’s brain last June. Scientists programmed the device to detect when gamma signals were high in Sarah’s amygdala, and respond with a tiny jolt to her VC/VS. This happened about 300 times a day. The stimulation was calibrated so Sarah didn’t feel any zaps, but she said they left her feeling a little more energetic.</p>



<p>The research paper describes <a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41591-021-01480-w">Sarah’s improvements as the technology did its work</a> in her head over two months; it’s unclear how long the benefits might last, though she’s now had the device implanted for over a year. “As time has gone on, it’s been this virtuous cycle, a spiral upwards,” Sarah said. “Everything has gotten easier and easier and easier.”</p>



<p>The approach used by the UCSF researchers required a lot of sophisticated imaging and machine learning technology. That complexity may prevent it from being a wider treatment, cautions Helen Mayberg, a neurologist at Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai in New York City.</p>



<p>Still, the results — which add to a variety of ways to detect and change problematic brain activity — contain valuable information about how depression takes hold of a brain, and how brain stimulation can change that, says Mayberg, whose research has helped build and refine the field of deep brain stimulation for mood disorders. “What we all want to know is, ‘How does this work?’”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/quantum-computer-error-correction-multiple-qubits-detect-mistakes">Scientists are one step closer to error-correcting quantum computers</a></h4>

              
                <p>Mistakes happen — especially in quantum computers. The fragile quantum bits, or qubits, that make up the machines are notoriously error-prone, but now scientists have shown that they can fix the flubs.</p>



<p>Computers that harness the rules of quantum mechanics show promise for making <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/quantum-computers-are-about-get-real">calculations</a> far out of reach for standard computers (<em>SN: 6/29/17</em>). But without a <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/quantum-computers-hype-supremacy-error-correction-problems">mechanism for fixing the computers’ mistakes</a>, the answers that a quantum computer spits out could be gobbledygook (<em>SN: 6/22/20</em>).</p>



<p>Combining the power of multiple qubits into one can <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-021-03928-y">solve the error woes</a>, researchers report October 4 in <em>Nature</em>. Scientists used nine qubits to make a single, improved qubit called a logical qubit, which, unlike the individual qubits from which it was made, can be probed to check for mistakes.</p>



<p>“This is a key demonstration on the path to build a large-scale quantum computer,” says quantum physicist Winfried Hensinger of the University of Sussex in&nbsp;Brighton, England, who was not involved in the new study.</p>





<p>Still, that path remains a long one, Hensinger says. To do complex calculations, scientists will have to dramatically scale up the number of qubits in the machines. But now that scientists have shown that they can keep errors under control, he says, “there’s nothing fundamentally stopping us to build a useful quantum computer.”</p>



<p>In a logical qubit, information is stored redundantly. That allows researchers to check and fix mistakes in the data. “If a piece of it goes missing, you can reconstruct it from the other pieces, like Voldemort,” says quantum physicist David Schuster of the University of Chicago, who was not involved with the new research. (The <em>Harry Potter</em> villain kept his soul safe by concealing it in multiple objects called Horcruxes.)</p>



<p>In the new study, four additional, auxiliary qubits interfaced with the logical qubit, in order to identify errors in its data. Future quantum computers could make calculations using logical qubits in place of the original, faulty qubits, repeatedly checking and fixing any errors that crop up.</p>



<p>To make their logical qubit, the researchers used a technique called a Bacon-Shor code, applying it to qubits made of ytterbium ions hovering above an ion-trapping chip inside a vacuum, which are manipulated with lasers. The researchers also designed sequences of operations so that errors don’t multiply uncontrollably, what’s known as “fault tolerance.”</p>



<p>Thanks to those efforts, the new logical qubit had a lower error rate than that of the most flawed components that made it up, says quantum physicist Christopher Monroe of the University of Maryland in College Park and Duke University.</p>



<p>However, the team didn’t quite complete the full process envisioned for error correction. While the computer detected the errors that arose, the researchers didn’t correct the mistakes and continue on with computation. Instead, they fixed errors after the computer was finished. In a full-fledged example, scientists would detect and correct errors multiple times on the fly.</p>



<p>Demonstrating quantum error correction is a necessity for building useful quantum computers. “It’s like achieving criticality with [nuclear] fission,” Schuster says. Once that nuclear science barrier <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/blog/context/anniversary-first-controlled-nuclear-chain-reaction">was passed in 1942</a>, it led to technologies like nuclear power and atomic bombs (<em>SN: 11/29/17</em>).</p>



<p>As quantum computers gradually draw closer to practical usefulness, companies are investing in the devices. Technology companies such as <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/quantum-computing-steps-forward-50-qubit-prototype">IBM</a>, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/google-quantum-computer-supremacy-claim">Google</a> and <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/quantum-computers-go-silicon">Intel</a> host major quantum computing endeavors. On October 1, a quantum computing company cofounded by Monroe, <a href="https://ionq.com/news/october-01-2021-ionq-listed-on-nyse">called IonQ</a>, went public; Monroe spoke to <em>Science News</em> while on a road trip to ring the opening bell at the New York Stock Exchange.</p>



<p>The new result suggests that full-fledged quantum error correction is almost here, says coauthor Kenneth Brown, a quantum engineer also at Duke University. “It really shows that we can get all the pieces together and do all the steps.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/nobel-prize-2021-physiology-medicine-julius-patapoutian-temperature-touch">Discovering how we sense temperature and touch wins the 2021 medicine Nobel Prize</a></h4>

              
                <p>Some touching research took the 2021 Nobel Prize in physiology or medicine. David Julius of the University of California, San Francisco and Ardem Patapoutian of the Scripps Research Institute in La Jolla, Calif., were awarded the prize October 4 for their research to identify sensors on nerve cells that detect heat, cold and pressure.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>The laureates discovered proteins called receptors that turn the burning heat from chili peppers or a hot stove, menthol’s cooling sensation or the pressure from a hug into nerve signals that can be sent to the brain. Those proteins are crucial to the sense of touch and for feeling pain.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Recognizing basic research on touch is important because “it’s such an elemental function of the nervous system, which is how we react with our environment,” says Walter Koroshetz, director of the U.S. National Institute of Neurological Diseases and Stroke in Bethesda, Md.</p>



<p>The temperature sensors warn of danger from fire or extreme cold, said Abdel El Manira, a neuroscientist and a member of the Nobel Assembly of the Karolinska Institute, which awards the physiology or medicine prize.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>





<p>Touch receptors are important for feeling where our body parts are in space. “Without them, we would not be able to stand. We would not be able to touch or feel our surroundings,” El Manira said. “Over the last year, we’ve been social distancing from one another. We have missed the sense of touch, the sense of the warmth we get from one another like during a hug.”</p>



<p>Despite its importance, “touch is perhaps the sense that people take mostly for granted,” Patapoutian said during a news conference.</p>



<p>Scientists had been searching for touch and temperature receptors for many years before Julius and Patapoutian began their work, Koroshetz said. “Everybody knew [the receptors] were there, but nobody could find them,” he says. Then the two laureates came up with some clever ways to probe for the elusive proteins.&nbsp;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" width="680" height="420" src="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/100421_nobel_physi-med_inline1_julius.jpg" alt="Nobel laureate David Julius standing in front of a glass backdrop" class="wp-image-3104266" srcset="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/100421_nobel_physi-med_inline1_julius.jpg 680w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/100421_nobel_physi-med_inline1_julius-620x383.jpg 620w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/100421_nobel_physi-med_inline1_julius-301x186.jpg 301w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><figcaption><span class="caption wp-caption-3104266">David Julius used capsaicin and menthol to probe nerve cells for proteins that detect heat and cold in his Nobel Prize–winning research.</span><span class="credit wp-credit-3104266">Steve Babuljak</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>Julius, a biochemist and molecular physiologist and Howard Hughes Medical Institute trustee, used capsaicin, the compound that gives chili peppers their heat, to discover receptor proteins that allow people to feel chili’s burn. At the time, he didn&#8217;t know that the receptor, TRPV1, also responds to heat, he said during a news conference. That discovery came later. </p>



<p>&#8220;Some of the great advances &#8230; in medicine started off with people just following their curiosity, without knowing in advance that they could one day be useful,&#8221; Julius said.</p>



<p>The protein is an ion channel, a type of molecular gate nestled in a cell’s membrane that opens or closes to control the flow of charged atoms or molecules into or out of the cell. In this case, when TRPV1 encounters capsaicin or heat, it opens, allowing charged calcium ions into the cell. That flood of calcium triggers electrical signals that are sent to the brain to warn of hot stuff.</p>



<p>Exactly how small changes in the protein’s shape allow it to communicate to the brain small differences in temperature, such as sensing when a room gets a few degrees warmer than usual, is still a mystery that Julius hopes to solve, he said.</p>



<p>Julius used the winter-fresh compound menthol to uncover TRPM8, a <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/cool-discovery-menthol-triggers-cold-sensing-protein">cold-sensing receptor protein</a> (<em>SN: 2/13/02</em>). Working independently, Patapoutian, a neuroscientist and a Howard Hughes Medical Institute investigator,  simultaneously discovered that receptor.</p>



<p>After spending about a year poking nerve cells in lab dishes, Patapoutian also discovered a receptor protein, PIEZO1, that opens in response to mechanical pressure. That protein, named after the Greek word for pressure, and another called <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/blog/science-ticker/main-protein-sensing-touch-identified-mammals">PIEZO2</a> allow people to feel touch (<em>SN: 12/4/14</em>).&nbsp;</p>



<p>PIEZO2 is the receptor on nerve cells in the skin called <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/role-merkels">Merkel cells that sense light touches</a> and caresses (<em>SN: 6/18/09</em>). It also <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/force-detecting-protein-senses-when-lungs-fill-air">helps nerves in the lungs keep the organs from overinflating</a> and is important for bladder and bowel functions (<em>SN: 12/21/16</em>). &nbsp; Children who lack PIEZO2 have balance problems and can’t feel where their limbs are, Koroshetz says. “They have to look to see where their fingers are when they reach out to grab something.”&nbsp; Abnormal pressure sensing may contribute to glaucoma and high blood pressure, too. PIEZO1 also is involved in regulating iron levels in the blood.</p>

Number 72 finally yielded results — earning him half the 2021 Nobel Prize in physiology or medicine.</span><span class="credit wp-credit-3104267">BBVA Foundation</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>Touch and temperature receptors may also be involved in processing pain. But despite the potential for drug development, pharmaceutical companies have struggled to develop new treatments using these channels, says Gary Lewin, whose lab at the Max Delbrück Center for Molecular Medicine in Berlin studies the molecular physiology of somatic sensation.</p>



<p>A major stumbling block comes from the fact that drugs targeting TRPV1, the receptor involved in sensing heat, tend to induce fever. Other closely related receptors may be more promising, says Lewin. “Both discoveries really boosted the field of pain research. But we’re really at the beginning — there’s a huge amount still to be discovered.” Treatments based on these receptors could provide an alternative to addictive pain medication, like opioids.</p>



<p>Because the touch receptors are involved in so many body processes, treatments aimed at them will need to be localized, such as with skin patches or delivering medication directly to the affected organ, Patapoutian said.</p>



<p>Julius and Patapoutian will split the prize of 10 million Swedish kronor, or more than $1.1 million.</p>



<p>Unlisted numbers and cell phones set on mute meant the Nobel committee had to track down the winners through relatives. Julius learned of the award through a sister-in-law. Patapoutian got a call from his 94-year-old father relaying the message. “I guess even if you have ‘do not disturb’ [on], people in your favorites can still call you,” he said. “It ended up being a very special moment.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2021/10/04/rage-over-repetitive-movements-it-could-be-misokinesia/">Rage Over Repetitive Movements? It Could Be Misokinesia</a></h4>

              
                <p><em>By </em><a href="https://twitter.com/E_Barratt">Emma L. Barratt</a></p>



<p>You may be aware of misophonia — an automatic, intense hatred of certain types of sounds, such as chewing, tapping, and breathing, to name a few. Misophonia entered mainstream awareness relatively recently, but hot on its heels is an extremely similar condition which relates not to sound, but to movement: misokinesia.</p>



<p>There are several well-established online support groups for those who relate to having strong negative affective responses to certain types of stimuli — typically small, repetitive movements, such as leg shaking or finger tapping. And, while it appears to be widespread, there has been a lack of dedicated research into the phenomenon — until now.</p>



<p>To properly introduce this under-recognised condition, Sumeet Jaswal and her colleagues based at the University of British Columbia <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-021-96430-4">recently published a set of studies</a> in <em>Scientific Reports</em> which aimed to establish key facts about the prevalence of misokinesia and what may cause it.</p>



<span id="more-44013"></span>



<p>In order to get a feel for the prevalence of misokinesia, as well as the viability of future studies, the team first conducted a pilot study. A total of 2751 undergraduates from the university’s psychology department were recruited for an online study in which they were asked two yes/no questions. The first, which aimed to measure the prevalence of misokinesia sensitivities, asked: “<em>Do you ever have strong negative feelings, thoughts, or physical reactions when seeing or viewing other peoples&#8217; fidgeting or repetitive movements (e.g., seeing someone&#8217;s foot shaking, fingers tapping, or gum chewing)?” </em>The second question was similar, but instead probed the sounds made by these kinds of actions; common triggers for the sound-related misophonia.</p>



<p>In total, 38.8% of students responded that yes, they did experience the described sensitivity to certain movements. The prevalence of misophonia sensitivites appeared to be higher, with 51.1% of students reporting that they related to the given description. Interestingly, female participants reported misokinesia sensitivities significantly more than their male counterparts (43.1% vs 24.7%, respectively), and there was a high level of overlap between those who reported sensitivity to sounds and movements. Similar patterns are seen in clinical populations with misophonia, which the authors interpreted to indicate the validity of their pair of questions.</p>



<p>This potentially high prevalence was taken as a green light to proceed to two more in-depth studies, the first of which looked at confirming these sensitivity prevalence rates and extending into two areas: the individual differences in misokinesia, and whether there was an association with heightened visual-attentional sensitivities.</p>



<p>In order to measure the presence of misokinesia sensitivities, which as of yet has no standardised measure, the researchers repurposed the previously established Misophonia Assessment Questionnaire (MpAQ) to measure sensitivity to visual, rather than auditory, stimuli. Both this Misokinesia Assessment Questionnaire (MkAQ) and the MpAQ were completed by 689 participants, alongside two measures of behavioural attention.</p>



<p>The first of these attentional measures asked participants to detect a target at a fixation point while ignoring brief moving distractor stimuli in the peripheries. This gave the team an idea of how well participants could &#8220;block out&#8221; distractions to their attention. The second test of attention, in contrast, measured how well participants were able to attend to stimuli in to their peripheries.</p>



<p>Analyses found that a huge 60.3% of the sample for this study experienced misokinesia sensitivities to some extent, in line with the estimates provided by the pilot study, and the team classified about one third of participants as having “high” misokinesia sensitivies. When it came to misophonia, 70.8% of participants experienced some level of sensitivities, and 37.8% had scores indicative of both misokinesia and misophonia, further suggesting co-morbidity between the two conditions.</p>



<p>However, the results of the attentional tasks provided no evidence that people with misokinesia show any differences from the control group in visuospatial attention. These participants were no more easily distracted by movement in their peripheries and were just as able to orient attention to items in the peripheries as those without misokinesia sensitivities.</p>



<p>In all, data collected in this first study suggest that misokinesia is a widespread phenomenon within non-clinical populations. The wide range in scores on the MkAQ suggest that it is not necessarily a binary phenomenon, but may be a spectrum with many individuals experiencing mild sensitivities, and others, much more intrusive ones. It also appears that reflexive visual attention is not a particular issue for those with misokinesia.</p>



<p>The second study in this paper looked at prevalence of misokinesia senstitivies in an older, more diverse population of 765 participants recruited from Amazon Mechanical Turk (Mturk).</p>



<p>In total, 38.1% of female participants and 35.3% or male participants responded <em>yes</em> to the same misokinesia question used in the first study, while 69.3% of females and 76.6% of males had MkAQ scores indicative of what this study determined to be low to high levels of misokinesia sensitivites. In fact, a massive 67.3% had scores suggesting high levels of misokinesia — many more than in the first study.</p>



<p>These findings suggest that misokinesia is not only prevalent within the wider population (or, at least in those with an MTurk account), but also that the severity of sensitivity may increase with age, or differ by sex or ethnicity. This may be addressed in future research in other demographics that are less strongly White and male.</p>



<p>This paper paints a picture of misokinesia being quite prevalent in the general population. The authors are also keen to emphasise that while their studies into visual attention showed null results, differences in visual attention among this population could still exist. It’s possible that those who experience misokinesia are well practiced at controlling their visual attention, which may have made their performances more typical, or that the stimuli included weren’t appropriate for measuring the condition. It’s also possible that, given the relatively prevalent co-morbidity with misophonia, those sudden negative reactions to movement may be tied to heightened reactivity. Some misophonia research has also pointed towards the possibility that <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2021/08/17/excessive-mirroring-could-explain-why-people-with-misophonia-react-strongly-to-sounds-of-chewing-or-drinking/">“over-mirroring” in the brain’s motor areas may be the root cause of discomfort for suffers</a>; it’s possible that misokinesia may stem from this, too. These are all potentially fruitful avenues for future research.</p>



<p>As this is a newly established topic, the measures used within these studies were somewhat exploratory, and are likely to have slightly suboptimal levels of validity. For example, it is unknown whether the MpQA’s adaptation into the MkQA really captures the experience of misokinesia. Additionally, in this study the cut-off points to classify people as having “no”, “low”, and “high” misokinesia were chosen so as to divide participants into three relatively equal groups; these thresholds of severity will require further study to verify. Further explorations, potentially including qualitative measures, will be needed to truly establish misokinesia as a research topic. Even so, this first paper represents a solid first step.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coronavirus-covid-antiviral-pill-merck-molnupiravir-hospitalization-death">A new antiviral pill cuts COVID-19 hospitalization and death rates</a></h4>

              
                <p>An at-home pill against coronavirus halves the chance that people newly diagnosed with COVID-19 will land in the hospital or die, early results released by the drug’s developer indicate.</p>



<p>The pill, an antiviral drug called molnupiravir, was tested against a placebo in people at high risk of developing severe disease. Of the 377 people who got the placebo, 14.1 percent, or 53, were hospitalized within 29 days of starting the trial, with eight dying. By comparison, 7.3 percent, or 28, of the 385 patients who got the drug were hospitalized in the same time period. <a href="https://www.merck.com/news/merck-and-ridgebacks-investigational-oral-antiviral-molnupiravir-reduced-the-risk-of-hospitalization-or-death-by-approximately-50-percent-compared-to-placebo-for-patients-with-mild-or-moderat/">None died</a>, officials with the pharmaceutical company Merck announced October 1 in a news release. Similar numbers of people taking the drug and the placebo reported side effects, but fewer people in the drug group stopped treatment because of those side effects. The news release did not describe what those side effects were.</p>



<p>About 40 percent of participants in the interim trial were infected with the gamma, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/delta-variant-studies-cdc-coronavirus-covid-pandemic">delta</a> or mu variants of the coronavirus (<em>SN: 7/30/21</em>). Molnupiravir was as effective against those variants as it was against earlier versions of the virus, the company reported. Full results from the study aren’t yet available and other scientists have not reviewed the data.</p>

<p>Finding <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coronavirus-covid-19-why-early-treatment-drugs">drugs that can work early in an infection</a> hasn’t been easy (<em>SN: 7/27/21</em>). Currently, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/covid-19-coronavirus-antibodies-lab-treatment-immune-system">only some lab-made antibodies are authorized</a> for newly diagnosed COVID-19 patients who are not sick enough to go to the hospital (<em>SN: 9/22/20</em>). Those antibodies must be given through an IV, making it difficult for some people to get treatment.</p>



<p>“Antiviral treatments that can be taken at home to keep people with COVID-19 out of the hospital are critically needed,” Wendy Holman, chief executive officer of Ridgeback Biotherapeutics said in the news release. Ridgeback and Merck have partnered to develop molnupiravir and will share profits.</p>



<p>The most exciting aspect of the drug is that it can be taken in pill form, rather than as an <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/covid-19-coronavirus-remdesivir-first-drug-recovery-treatment">intravenous infusion like remdesivir</a>, says Mark Denison, a virologist at Vanderbilt University Medical Center in Nashville (<em>SN: 4/29/20</em>). He did much of the early lab testing of molnupiravir, previously known as <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coronavirus-covid-19-new-early-treatments">EIDD-2801</a> or MK-4482, but was not involved in the clinical trials (<em>SN: 8/24/20</em>).</p>



<p>In some of the children Denison treats as the director of pediatric infectious diseases at VUMC, remdesivir treatment comes too late. The same is true for many adults hospitalized with COVID-19. “At that point, why don’t you just pour the drug on their heads instead of giving it to them IV, because you’ve already moved past the window where it can be effective.” Delaying antiviral treatment is akin to waiting to give antibiotics until a wound is infected down to the bone, he says.</p>

<p>Giving antivirals early in an infection has a chance of stopping the virus before it can do much damage or prod the immune system to overreact. Molnupiravir could potentially be prescribed as soon a patient gets a positive COVID-19 test result, perhaps heading off floods of COVID-19 patients that are overwhelming medical systems as the highly transmissible delta variant circulates. In combination with vaccines, an effective early treatment might help get the pandemic under control.</p>



<p>Interim results from the molnupiravir study were so encouraging, an independent review panel decided to stop the global trial early. Merck said it plans to seek emergency use authorization for the drug from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and will apply for authorization in other countries as well.</p>



<p>“To stop a trial for futility is pretty common, when a drug isn’t working or when it’s showing a negative effect,” Denison says. “But to stop a trial because of efficacy, because the drug is working so well is really unusual. He adds, “I’m amazed but not surprised” that the antiviral performed well in humans. In his experiments with cells grown in lab dishes and in animal tests, “I was blown away by its effectiveness against multiple coronaviruses.”</p>



<p>Like the FDA-approved antiviral remdesivir, molnupiravir mimics building blocks of the coronavirus’s genetic material, RNA. The fake building blocks interfere with the polymerase enzyme the coronavirus uses to copy its RNA. But the two drugs work differently. Remdesivir is a delayed stop sign, Denison says. When it is inserted into a growing strand of RNA, it slows the polymerase, eventually causing it to grind to a halt, much like a car entering an intersection as the traffic light turns yellow may stop in the middle of the intersection, he says. Molnupiravir instead pockmarks the RNA with many mutations, causing the breakdown of the polymerase and other viral components, much like a pothole-strewn road can cause a car to break down. Those mutation potholes don’t just stop the RNA-copying enzyme, they also cause damage to other proteins the virus needs to infect cells and replicate.</p>





<p>Viruses can develop resistance to some antivirals, like the anti-influenza drug osteltamavir, sold under the brand name Tamiflu. But with molnupiravir, “resistance mutations can’t emerge because the drug makes too many other damaging mutations,” Denison says.</p>



<p>Merck says it can make as many as 10 million doses of molnupiravir by the end of the year. The company has entered into agreements with generic drug makers in more than 100 low and middle-income countries to produce the drug as well.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/marie-antoinette-letters-ink-analysis-hidden-words-censor">Ink analysis reveals Marie Antoinette’s letters’ hidden words and who censored them</a></h4>

              
                <p>In a world torn apart by the French Revolution, doomed Queen Marie Antoinette exchanged secret letters with a rumored lover. Someone later censored them — and now scientists know who.</p>



<p>Chemical analyses of the ink <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.abg4266">reveal not only the obscured words, but also the identity of the censor</a>, researchers report October 1 in <em>Science Advances</em>.</p>



<p>From June 1791 to August 1792, as Marie Antoinette and the rest of the royal family were confined to Paris’ Tuileries Palace following an escape attempt, the queen managed a clandestine correspondence with Swedish Count Axel von Fersen.</p>



<p>Whether the correspondents exchanged words of love or state secrets was a longstanding mystery, says Anne Michelin, a chemist at the National Museum of Natural History in Paris. Michelin and colleagues unraveled this mystery using X-ray fluorescence spectroscopy.</p>



<p>XRF, a noninvasive technique, works by shooting an X-ray beam at a sample, kicking the atoms in the sample into a higher-energy state. The sample then emits its own X-rays along a spectrum characteristic of its elemental makeup. With XRF, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/archaeopteryx-fossil-seen-new-light">paleontologists have scrutinized fossils</a> and <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/blog/science-ticker/x-rays-reveal-portrait-hiding-beneath-degas-masterpiece">art restorers have found hidden paintings</a> (<em>SN: 5/10/10</em>; <em>SN: 8/4/16</em>).</p>

<p>Here, the researchers zoomed in on the ink. Both correspondents used common gall ink made from iron sulfate, but different inks contain different proportions of trace elements, depending on the source, Michelin says. The team scanned the letters pixel by pixel, finding consistent differences in the copper-to-iron and the zinc-to-iron ratios of the original and redacting inks. By mapping each pixel’s elemental differences onto a gray scale, the hidden words emerged — words such as &#8220;beloved,&#8221; &#8220;tender friend&#8221; and &#8220;madly.”</p>



<p>As for the censor, it was von Fersen himself, Michelin says. The count was known to make copies of Marie Antoinette’s letters — and the ink used for the redactions was a match to those copies.</p>



<p>How much of their relationship was personal versus political may never be known, she adds, but we do know that “he kept these letters, even though it was risky for him.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2021/10/01/left-wing-authoritarianism-is-real-and-needs-to-be-taken-seriously-in-political-psychology-study-argues/">Left-Wing Authoritarianism Is Real And Needs To Be Taken Seriously In Political Psychology, Study Argues</a></h4>

              
                <p><em>By</em> <a href="https://emmayoung.net/">Emma Young</a></p>



<p>Authoritarianism has been well-studied by psychologists. Well, right-wing authoritarianism has. In fact, as that’s typically the only type that’s studied, you might be forgiven for thinking that’s what authoritarianism <em>is</em>. The very idea of <em>left-wing</em> authoritarianism (LWA) has received not only little academic attention, but a lot of scepticism from psychologists. “I think I have not found any authoritarians on the left because if there ever were any, most of them have dried up and blown away….” wrote Bob Altemeyer, <a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/record/1997-08573-000">pioneer of work on right-wing authoritarianism</a>, in 1996.</p>



<p>But as Thomas Costello at Emory University and colleagues write in their <a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2021-74485-001">new paper</a> in the <em>Journal of Personality and Social Psychology: Personality Processes and Individual Differences</em>, “From Maoist China to the Khmer Rouge (and perhaps even the French Reign of Terror), history abounds with examples of LWA at the broader societal level, rendering psychology’s inability to identify left-wing authoritarians puzzling.”</p>



<p>Puzzling is right. Perhaps predominantly left-leaning researchers have been unwilling to even go there…. But in their new paper, Costello and his colleagues absolutely go there. They conclude that LWA does indeed exist, and they define not only its characteristics but the characteristics of the people who subscribe to it. They also reveal substantial similarities between authoritarians on the political right and the left.</p>



<span id="more-44007"></span>



<p>First, the team used a bottom-up approach to devise a scale to get at LWA. As well as scouring research papers for items that might relate to authoritarianism, they solicited ideas for items from psychologists, political scientists and philosophers. Using multiple batches of online participants, the team gradually whittled down and revised these items. They ended up with 39 items that reflected three conceptually distinct dimensions of LWA. I’ll take the definitions directly from the paper:&nbsp;</p>



<ul><li><strong>Antihierarchical Aggression</strong> &#8211; <em>the belief that those currently in power should be punished, the established order should be overthrown, and that extreme actions, such as political violence, are justifiable to achieve these aims.</em><br></li><li><strong>Anticonventionalism</strong> &#8211; <em>the rejection of traditional values, a moral absolutism concerning progressive values and concomitant dismissal of conservatives as inherently immoral, and a need for political homogeneity in one’s social environment.</em><br></li><li><strong>Top-Down Censorship</strong> &#8211; <em>preferences for the use of governmental and institutional authority to quash opposition and bar offensive and intolerant speech.</em></li></ul>



<p>Looking over that list, I certainly know some people who I’m sure think of themselves as being extremely liberal but who would score pretty highly on the anti-conventionalism dimension, at least.</p>



<p>The researchers then ran studies using fresh batches of participants and an impressive array of self-report scales to look at everything from personality, to mood, to cognition. They found a few differences between left-wing and right-wing authoritarians. People who scored highly on the LWA scale reported more negative emotions and were more neurotic than average (unlike RWAs). They were also more likely to report schadenfreude. The RWAs, meanwhile, scored higher for unjustified certainty in their beliefs and confirmatory thinking (a tendency to favour information that supports your beliefs). RWA was also more strongly linked to cognitive rigidity and low openness, as well as a lower than typical belief in science.</p>



<p>However, there were a <em>lot</em> more similarities between the two groups than differences. So much so, that it seems there is a shared constellation of traits “that might be considered the ‘heart’ of authoritarianism”, the team writes. These shared traits include (and again, I’ll quote directly from the paper): a “preference for social uniformity, prejudice towards different others, willingness to wield group authority to coerce behaviour, cognitive rigidity, aggression and punitiveness towards perceived enemies, outsized concern for hierarchy and moral absolutism.”</p>



<p>In terms of potentially dangerous implications for others, both left- and ring-wing authoritarianism was linked to the endorsement of political violence; but for the LWAs, that was violence directed <em>at</em> the state (violent protests, for example), whereas for the RWAs, it was <em>in support of </em>the state (supporting police crackdowns, say).</p>



<p>As well as analysing this self-report data, the team ran a study designed to look at LWA and actual behaviour. Online participants selected the difficulty level of a set of puzzles that they believed they were giving to another participant to complete. Before they chose the puzzles, though, they were shown what they were told was the Facebook profile of this ‘partner’. Those who’d scored highly for LWA ‘punished’ partners with right-wing profiles with harder puzzles and ‘helped’ those with left-wing profiles with easier puzzles. This was the case even when participants’ political ideology was taken into account, showing that LWA can be linked to actual aggressive behaviour towards the political outgroup above and beyond any effects of political ideology, the team concluded.</p>



<p>None of these studies were on groups of participants who were representative of a general population, however. So the researchers ran a fresh study on 834 who were selected to be representative of the population of the US. Again, they found large correlations between LWA scores and dogmatism, as well as schadenfreude, moral disengagement and violence towards out-groups. This included actual participation in the use of force for a political cause over the preceding five years. It also included support of violent group action during protests against police brutality towards Black Americans over the summer of 2020, in the wake of the murder of George Floyd.&nbsp;</p>



<p>All in all, then, the team present a lot of studies — and a lot of analyses. There are some limitations to the work, however. Because of the nature of the scales, it’s not possible to tell whether right-wing authoritarians are more authoritarian than the left-wing type, or vice versa, say. Also, the route to LWA may be more well-meaning than the route to RWA, the researchers write; for example, someone who wants passionately to challenge inequality in society may end up thinking violent protest is the only option. “Any similarities across LWA and RWA notwithstanding, we endorse no claims of motivational or moral equivalence (or lack thereof) across the two constructs at present,” they write.</p>



<p>Their body of results surely suggests, though, that arguments that the search for LWA should be abandoned should themselves be abandoned. In fact, excluding left-wing features from studies of authoritarianism “has limited the kinds of knowledge we can produce as psychological scientists,” the team argues. And given the relevance of authoritarianism to politics, globally, and to how societies respond to and fight for change, surely it’s high time for that to shift.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/children-climate-change-generation-burden-extreme-heat">2020 babies may suffer up to seven times as many extreme heat waves as 1960s kids</a></h4>

              
                <p>The kids are not all right. Children born in 2020 <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.abi7339">could live through seven times as many extreme heat waves</a> as people born in 1960.</p>



<p>That&#8217;s&nbsp;the projected&nbsp;generational disparity&nbsp;if global greenhouse gas emissions are curbed by the amount currently promised by the world’s nations, climate scientist&nbsp;Wim Thiery&nbsp;of Vrije Universiteit Brussel in Belgium and colleagues report September 26 in&nbsp;<em>Science</em>. Under current&nbsp;pledges,&nbsp;Earth’s average temperature is expected to&nbsp;increase by&nbsp;about 2.4 degrees Celsius relative to preindustrial times by 2100. While the older generation will experience an average of about four extreme heat waves during their lifetime, the younger generation could experience an average of about 30 such heat waves, the researchers say.</p>



<p>More stringent reductions that would limit&nbsp;warming to just&nbsp;1.5 degrees C would shrink — but not erase — the disparity: Children born in 2020 could still experience four times as many extreme heat waves as people born in 1960.</p>



<p>Scientists have previously outlined how climate change <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/climate-change-un-ipcc-report-humans">has already amped up extreme weather events</a> around the globe, and how those climate impacts are projected to increase as the world continues to warm (<em>SN: 8/9/21</em>). The new study is the first to specifically quantify how much more exposed younger generations will be to those events.</p>



<p>An average child born in 2020 also will experience two times as many wildfires, 2.8 times as many river floods, 2.6 times as many droughts and about three times as many crop failures as a child born 60 years earlier, under climate scenarios based on current pledges. That exposure to extreme events becomes even higher in certain parts of the world: In the Middle East, for example, 2020 children will see up to 10 times as many heat waves as the older cohort, the team found.</p>



<p>With this possible grim future in mind, student climate activists in the #FridaysforFuture movement have been <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/youth-climate-change-activists-heat-waves-top-science-stories-2019-yir">among the most powerful voices of protest in recent years</a> (<em>SN: 12/16/19</em>). Thiery and colleagues note that these findings come at a crucial time, as world leaders prepare to gather in Glasgow, Scotland, in late October for the 2021 United Nations Climate Change Conference to negotiate new pledges to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.</p>

The subject was a young woman about to graduate from college. As far as she could tell, she's always had these experiences, and for most of her life she didn't know they were unusual. This <a href="https://neurocritic.blogspot.com/2019/06/the-shock-of-unknown-in-aphantasia.html" target="_blank">surprise</a> upon discovering the uniqueness of one's one internal experience is similar to what is reported by many contemporary individuals with less typical phenomenology, such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aphantasia" target="_blank">aphantasia</a> (the inability to generate visual images).</p><p>Pierce noted that the subject was anosmic (<span class="css-901oao css-16my406 r-poiln3 r-bcqeeo r-qvutc0">had a loss of smell), although this was not formally tested. Nonetheless, he observed:</span></p><p><span class="css-901oao css-16my406 r-poiln3 r-bcqeeo r-qvutc0"></span></p><blockquote>Coffee burning upon a stove is not noticed, though she may be close by. Camphor placed in the nostrils gives only a stinging sensation. Ammonia can be sniffed without discomfort. And, as with all anosmics, foods are discriminated on the basis of the pure taste qualities, or by the characters of texture, astringency, and so on, which any food-complex may possess. These sensory defects are worth noting for their possible significance in connection with the theory of this special case of synæsthesia.</blockquote><p>&nbsp;<br /><br />Some aspects of the report were rather quaint by modern standards (e.g., the first person narration), but others were quite prescient.<br /></p><blockquote>But what evidence have we that an actual case of synæsthesia is here being reported, and not a case of artificial association due to a lively dramatic fancy? This is a point that must be raised, for it is very easy to entertain a suspicion that these phenomena are essentially ungenuine. Now, of course, in matters of this kind general impressions and personal knowledge of the subject count heavily. And on both these grounds I have no hesitation in asserting my conviction that the above-cited equivalents are the expression of a genuine synæsthesia.</blockquote><p></p><p></p><p><br /><br />One key piece of evidence was the consistency of gustatory experiences associated with the same words at a later date:<br /></p><blockquote>...the equivalents possess a constancy which would hardly be possible apart from a true synæsthesia. After an interval of six months a number of words were given at random from the original list, with the result that the identical equivalents were described in almost precisely the same language.</blockquote><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Also, there was a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Somatotopic_arrangement" target="_blank">somatotopic</a>-like arrangement for some of the gustatory experiences:<br /></p><blockquote>Many of the experiences are given quite definite locations in the mouth. Thus the equivalents of <i>Ethel</i> and <i>Hall</i> (tactual) are felt at  the tip of the tongue; of <i>lox</i> (irritation) at the back of the throat; of <i>Judith</i> (salt) at the sides of the tongue; of <i>Sarah</i> (cold) on the lips; of <i>amethyst</i> (bitter) "at the back of the mouth, on the roof, where the root of the tongue seems to hit it" ...</blockquote><p></p><p>&nbsp;<br /></p>Pierce tried to discern whether similar sounds could be related to similar gustatory experiences, but that wasn't the case. Nor were they related to similarities in articulation. He still preferred a physiological explanation, yet...<br /><blockquote>In attempting to decide whether the above-cited experiences are to be explained by the physiological or by the psychological theory, we are, apparently, in no better and in no worse case than in respect to all varieties of synæsthesia. No decisive facts are at hand.</blockquote><p>&nbsp;</p><p>An interesting <a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/article-abstract/444104" target="_blank">commentary</a> in <i>JAMA</i> predated <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/?term=MRI+connectivity+synesthesia&amp;sort=date&amp;size=50" target="_blank">MRI connectivity</a> studies of synesthesia by nearly a century in its speculation about alternative brain wiring:</p><p></p><blockquote>There is little evidence one way or the other as to whether or not this phenomenon is to be explained on purely physiologic grounds, depending on a cross circuiting of the association fibers between different brain centers. </blockquote><p></p><br /><br />Pierce concludes his paper with a pithy aphorism that acknowledges the inconclusiveness of the study:<br /><blockquote><span style="color: #cc0000;"><span style="color: black;">Still, here no less than in all known cases of synaesthesis, </span><b>we can only regret that our theory is so lame while our facts are so secure.</b></span></blockquote><br /><br /> <p> <b>References</b><br /><br />Pierce AH.

<html><body><p>In April 2021&nbsp;we launched our dedicated <a href="https://plos.org/dei/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">DEI webpage</a> where we outline our commitment to diversity, equity, and inclusion. Our commitment not only includes how we run our organization but also extends to how we execute our mission to accelerate progress in science and medicine by leading a transformation in research communication. Truly Open Science requires direct action.</p>



<p>The <a href="https://plos.org/dei/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">DEI webpage</a> is, however, more than just the words of our commitment. It is also where we transparently share our specific <a href="https://plos.org/dei/#goals" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">DEI goals</a> in order to be held accountable to them. We&rsquo;ve committed to sharing regular progress on this blog, and this is the first of those updates. (PLOS staff will continue to write their own posts about their particular thoughts and activities around DEI, also.)</p>



<p>Some of the goals will suit incremental updates, and some suit annual reporting. We&rsquo;ll link each update below to the particular goal it relates to, and provide links when relevant. We will also be transparent about key setbacks or if we miss any targets, rather than simply glossing over these. </p>



<p><strong>Goal: Increasing the number of historically underrepresented external contributors (e.g. authors, editors, reviewers) and strategic partners.</strong></p>



<ul><li>Our journals are committed to <a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2021/04/launching-new-journals-2021/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">equitable participation</a>, and we&rsquo;re pleased with our progress to create representative editorial boards for our newly launched journals <a href="https://journals.plos.org/climate/s/editorial-board" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>PLOS Climate</em></a><em>, </em><a href="https://journals.plos.org/digitalhealth/s/editorial-board" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>PLOS Digital Health</em></a><em>, </em><a href="https://journals.plos.org/globalpublichealth/s/editorial-board" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>PLOS Global Public Health</em></a><em>, </em><a href="https://journals.plos.org/sustainabilitytransformation/s/editorial-board" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>PLOS Sustainability &amp; Transformation</em></a><em>, </em>and <a href="https://journals.plos.org/water/s/editorial-board" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>PLOS Water</em></a><em>.&nbsp;</em></li><li>We have been particularly successful with diverse representation for <a href="https://journals.plos.org/globalpublichealth/s/editorial-board" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>PLOS Global Public Health</em></a>, and at the end of this post is a video recorded with the journal&rsquo;s Co-Editors-in-Chief and Executive Editor, where they discuss how they managed to assemble this truly global and diverse editorial board.</li><li>Day 1 of our week of programming for the start of our <a href="https://plos.org/scientists-for-open-science/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Scientists for Open Science</a> campaign was dedicated to <a href="https://plos.org/event/inclusion/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Inclusion</a>.&nbsp;</li><li>We are in the final stages of drafting a survey to assess contributor diversity, which will be deployed in Q4 of 2021.</li></ul>



<p><strong>Goal: Developing editorial processes that recognize and minimize bias in the publication process, along high ethical standards.</strong></p>



<ul><li>PLOS has <a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2021/09/announcing-a-new-plos-policy-on-inclusion-in-global-research/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">instituted a new policy</a> to improve transparency in the reporting of research that is conducted in other countries or communities in order to prevent &ldquo;parachute research&rdquo; (also known as &ldquo;helicopter&rdquo; or &ldquo;neo-colonial science&rdquo;). Watch a recorded conversation, below, with some of the stakeholders who helped develop this policy.</li><li>*PLOS has formally joined the multi-publisher initiative to accelerate research culture change, coordinated by the Royal Society of Chemistry (RSC) &ndash;&nbsp; <a href="https://www.rsc.org/new-perspectives/talent/joint-commitment-for-action-inclusion-and-diversity-in-publishing/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Joint commitment for action on inclusion and diversity in publishing</a>. We had been participating and contributing from the start, but this update serves to make the collaboration official, and with pooled resources helps all publishers drive towards this goal.&nbsp;</li><li>*PLOS is also a member of the <a href="https://c4disc.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Coalition for Diversity and Inclusion in Scholarly Communications</a> (C4DISC) and as such commits to uphold its <a href="https://c4disc.org/principles/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">principles</a>.</li></ul>



<p>*A note on industry collaborations: we believe that collaborating with other publishers will help us all develop the methods and metrics to understand the diversity of our collective journals&rsquo; editorial boards, conscious of regional privacy laws and cultures, which in turn will help enable us <em>all </em>to improve diversity, equity, and inclusion.</p>

<p><strong>Goal: Increasing the number of historically underrepresented employees at PLOS, with an emphasis on managerial employee roles.</strong></p>



<ul><li>Through September 2021, we have met our internal sub-goal that every PLOS Leadership Team vacancy (4 vacancies filled in 2021) has included final candidates historically underrepresented in leadership, particularly Black, Latina/o, Indigenous and transgender people. In early 2022, we will report on how this has affected hiring outcomes for 2021.</li><li>We have increased investment by more than 50% to develop our recruiting function and interview methods , which are instrumental in meaningfully changing the way we hire. In September, we conducted a leadership team retrospective on the progress we&rsquo;ve made, what the challenges are, and where we&rsquo;ll focus our efforts in 2022.</li></ul>



<p><strong>Goal: Increasing the quantifiable signals of an inclusive work environment that values divergent perspectives, encourages critical inquiry, and ensures equitable advancement and rewards.</strong></p>



<ul><li>In early 2021, we translated our ideals of &ldquo;diversity&rdquo;, &ldquo;equity&rdquo;, and &ldquo;inclusion&rdquo; into three distinct sets of competencies in which to anchor our goals and development activities</li><li>In March, every leader at PLOS set DEI goals for 2021: goals ranged from raising awareness around key issues to changing processes to produce more equitable outcomes.</li><li>Our Chief People and Equity Officer, Kristina Martin, participated in a C4DISC panel discussion &ldquo;<a href="https://c4disc.org/2021/06/15/ssp-session-the-glass-ceiling-you-dont-know-about-yet-removing-barriers-for-people-with-disabilities-at-work/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Glass Ceiling You Don&rsquo;t Know About Yet: Removing Barriers for People with (Dis)abilities at Work</a>&rdquo;</li><li>On October 12, 2021 we&rsquo;re hosting an internal PLOS &ldquo;Listening Session&rdquo; in which neurodiverse leaders share their lived experiences with Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder, Autism Spectrum Disorder, and Bipolar Disorder.&nbsp;</li><li>In November, managers and employees will have practice sessions for strategies we&rsquo;ve previously introduced to identify and reduce bias.</li><li>While barriers related to privacy, data collection and storage have prevented us from capturing broad diversity data across PLOS&rsquo; global employee population, we are working through the issues and plan to have the systems in place in 2022 to accurately capture data related to hire, retention and progression of employees at PLOS, disaggregated by identity group. In the meantime, we are collecting data for two smaller groups: the PLOS Leadership Team and our DEI Steering Committee. We will share this data in early 2022.</li></ul>



<p><strong>Goal: Increasing the publication of research that studies inequalities, racism, and inequities facing minority and/or marginalized populations (within the scope of each of our journals).</strong></p>



<ul><li>We are still looking into the best way to meaningfully feature articles across our portfolio of journals in this way, and will report in the future. In the meantime, we will share this blog post regarding the mission of <em>PLOS Global Public Health</em>, from the Co-Editors: <a href="https://speakingofmedicine.plos.org/2021/06/14/plos-global-public-health-charting-a-new-path-towards-equity-diversity-and-inclusion-in-global-health/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">PLOS Global Public Health, charting a new path towards equity, diversity and inclusion in global health</a></li></ul>

<p><strong>Probing pharaohs with X-rays</strong> — <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/probing-new-kingdom-pharaohs-x-rays"><em>Science News</em></a>, October 9, 1971</p>



<p>The 29 mummies of pharaohs and queens were examined without disturbing their present positions.… [Researchers using portable X-ray equipment] found evidence of rheumatoid inflammation of the vertebrae of Amenophis II, ruler of Egypt from 1436 to 1413 B.C…. [A queen] was buried with what was thought to be her mummified infant. But radiography of the object confirmed its identification as a mummified adolescent baboon.</p>



<h4>Update</h4>



<p>Scientists now investigate Egyptian mummies with advanced imaging devices that were <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/ct-scans-show-first-x-rayed-mummy-new-light">unavailable in 1971</a>. <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/microct-xray-ancient-animal-mummies">Micro-CT scans and virtual reality models</a> have provided detailed life history and embalming information about three animal mummies — a cat, a bird and a snake (<em>SN: 9/12/20, p.&nbsp;17</em>). 3-D printing has enabled scientists to <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/3d-printed-vocal-tract-ancient-mummy-voice-speak-beyond-grave">reconstruct the vocal tract and simulate the voice</a> of a 3,000-year-old mummified priest (<em>SN: 2/15/20, p. 14</em>). And <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/infrared-images-reveal-hidden-tattoos-egyptian-mummies">infrared scanner</a>s have revealed tattoos on seven mummies dating to about 3,000 years ago (<em>SN: 12/21/19 &amp; 1/4/20, p. 8</em>).</p>

<html><body><p>We don&rsquo;t often toot our horn at PLOS, but we&rsquo;d be remiss not to acknowledge the wonderful work our institutional partnership team has done in changing the scholarly landscape with respect to how papers are paid for. The <a href="https://www.alpsp.org/">Association of Learned and Professional Society Publishers (ALPSP)</a> honored PLOS&rsquo; work at the ALPSP annual meeting last week. The PLOS team was named co-winners for Innovation in Publishing 2021. PLOS shares this honor with <a href="https://mindscapecommons.net/login">Mindscape Commons</a> by Coherent Digital, which is the first and largest collection of Virtual Reality (VR) video content for teaching and learning in mental health.</p>



<p>PLOS journals are underpinned by our existing, and new, institutional business models that move beyond the Article Processing Charge (APC) to ensure more equitable and regionally appropriate ways to support Open Access publishing. PLOS&rsquo; institutional models are <a href="https://plos.org/resources/community-action-publishing/">Community Action Publishing (CAP)</a>, <a href="https://plos.org/resources/for-institutions/flat-fee-agreements/">Flat Fee agreement</a>, and the <a href="https://plos.org/resources/global-equity-model/">Global Equity model</a>.&nbsp; The award was specifically for Community Action Publishing, a non-APC based model that uses collective action by institutions to pay for publication fees.</p>



<p>&ldquo;Community and partnerships are built on trust and we&rsquo;re so grateful to our current and future library partners for the trust and openness they&rsquo;ve brought to developing this model,&rdquo; said Sara Rouhi, Director of Strategic Partnerships for PLOS. &ldquo;This award would also not have been possible without the amazing collaboration of our team and Raym Crow at the Chain Bridge Group, who specializes in Open Access business models.&rdquo;</p>

                <p>We’re pleased to announce that <strong>Caltech, CERN, Georgia Institute of Technology, and MIT</strong> have pledged to become “arXiv champions of open science” for 2022. Each of these institutions has chosen to contribute $10,000 each &#8212; and this support will have a significant impact on arXiv’s ability to serve researchers. Thank you for leading the global research community towards truly open science!</p>
<p>&#8220;arXiv has become an indispensable platform for scientific exchange in particle physics and beyond and submitting to arXiv is today a standard practice across CERN and the entire community,&#8221; said Joachim Mnich, CERN’s Director for Research and Computing.</p>
<p>&#8220;The Caltech Library is pleased to contribute to arXiv at the Champion Level. For many, many years our researchers have been heavy contributors and users of arXiv. The Library recognizes the importance of this resource to the Caltech community,&#8221; said Joy Painter, Physics, Math &amp; Astronomy Librarian at Caltech.</p>
<p>arXiv membership is open to universities, libraries, and research institutes. The vast majority of <a href="https://arxiv.org/about/ourmembers">arXiv’s 2021 members</a> plan to renew in January, and we would like to extend a very special thank you to the organizations listed below that have already proactively confirmed their 2022 arXiv membership.</p>
<p>arXiv was founded strictly for research and education &#8212; not profit. That’s why we rely on the generosity of members, affiliates, sponsors, and other donors to support daily operations, critical infrastructure updates, and new initiatives.</p>
<p>We understand that the pandemic has affected many organizations’ budgets, and we are grateful that, despite the challenges, many institutions are renewing their commitment to open science. For institutions struggling with budget constraints, the flexible “Community Membership” option is available &#8212; support in any amount strengthens open science at arXiv.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for joining us on this journey! The following institutions have proactively confirmed their 2022 arXiv membership. <em>(Is your institution missing from this list? There’s still plenty of time to confirm your 2022 support. <a href="mailto:membership@arxiv.org">Email us</a> or <a href="https://arxiv.org/about/membership_confirm">confirm your membership here</a>.) </em></p>

                Kyoto University has fired a researcher after determining that he committed fraud in at least five papers about the deadly Kumamoto earthquake of 2006.

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/volcano-eruptions-rainy-period-earth-climate-dinosaur-friendly">A volcano-induced rainy period made Earth’s climate dinosaur-friendly</a></h4>

              
                <p>The biggest beasts to walk the Earth had humble beginnings. The first dinosaurs were cat-sized, lurking in the shadows, just waiting for their moment. That moment came when four major pulses of volcanic activity changed the climate in a geologic blink of an eye, causing a 2-million-year-long rainy spell that coincided with dinos rising to dominance, a new study suggests.</p>



<p>Clues found in sediments buried deep beneath an ancient lake basin in China <a href="https://www.pnas.org/content/118/40/e2109895118">link the volcanic eruptions with climate swings and environmental changes</a> that created a globe-spanning hot and humid oasis in the middle of the hot and dry Triassic Period, researchers report in the Oct. 5 <em>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences</em>. During this geologically brief rainy period 234 million to 232 million years ago, called the Carnian Pluvial Episode, dinosaurs started evolving into the hulking and diverse creatures that would dominate the landscape for the next 166 million years.</p>



<p>Previous research has noted the jump in global temperatures, humidity and rainfall during this time period, as well as a changeover in land and sea life. But these studies lacked detail on what caused these changes, says Jason Hilton, a paleobotanist at the University of Birmingham in England.</p>



<p>So Hilton and his colleagues turned to a several-hundred-meter-long core of lake-bottom sediments drawn from the Jiyuan Basin for answers. The core contained four distinct layers of sediments that included volcanic ash that the team dated to between 234 million and 232 million years ago, matching the timing of the Carnian Pluvial Episode. Within those layers, the team also found mercury, a proxy for volcanic eruptions. “Mercury entered the lake from a mix of atmospheric pollution, volcanic ash and also being washed in from surrounding land that had elevated levels of mercury from volcanism,” Hilton says.</p>

<p>Further evidence for the link between volcanism and environmental change during the Carnian Pluvial Episode came from corresponding layers in the core that showed different types of carbon, indicating four massive releases of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. Finally, microfossils and pollens changed within the same core section, from species that prefer drier climates to ones that tend to grow in warm and humid climates.</p>



<p>The reconstructed history suggests that the volcanic pulses injected huge amounts of CO₂ into the atmosphere, says coauthor Jacopo Dal Corso, a geologist at the University of Leeds in England. That boosted temperatures and intensified the hydrologic cycle, enhancing rainfall and increasing runoff into lakes, he says. At the same time, terrestrial plants evolved, with humidity-loving flora becoming predominant. As the rains created wet environments, turtles, large amphibians called metoposaurids — and dinosaurs — began to thrive.</p>



<p>Together, these diverse lines of evidence reveal that the Carnian Pluvial Episode was actually four distinct pulses of significant environmental change — each triggered by massive volcanic eruptions, Dal Corso says.</p>

<p>The mercury and carbon data together suggest the increase in mercury came from a “major source of volcanism that was capable of impacting the global carbon cycle,” rather than local eruptions, the team writes. That volcanism likely came from the Wrangellia Large Igneous Province eruption in what is now British Columbia and Alaska, which has previously, but tenuously, been linked to the Carnian Pluvial Episode. If true, it means the Wrangellia eruption occurred in pulses, rather than one sustained eruption. &nbsp;</p>



<p>This paper marks the “first time that mercury and carbon isotope data are so well correlated across the Carnian Pluvial Episode,” says Andrea Marzoli, an igneous petrologist at the University of Padua in Italy who has studied Wrangellia but was not involved in this research.&nbsp; “The authors make a strong argument in favor of volcanically induced global climate change pulses.” However, Marzoli notes, “the link to Wrangellia is still weak, simply because we don’t know the age of Wrangellia.”</p>







<p>Alastair Ruffell, a forensic geologist at Queen’s University Belfast in Ireland not involved in this study, agrees, saying he’d like to see more evidence of cause and effect between Wrangellia and the environmental changes. This study offers some of the best proxies and data from terrestrial sources to date, but more terrestrial records of the Carnian Pluvial Episode are needed, he says, to “understand what this actually looked like on the ground.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>The climate changes marked a tipping point for life that couldn’t adjust, and those groups went extinct. Animals like dinosaurs and plants like cycads, says Ruffell, were “waiting in the wings” to seize their opportunity. A <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/long-necked-dinosaurs-sauropod-jurassic-herbivores">similar cycle of volcanic activity and environmental change</a> starting about 184 million years ago may have paved the way for the biggest of all dinos, long-necked sauropods, to lumber into dominance (<em>SN: 11/17/20</em>).</p>

              <h4><a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2021/09/30/blind-and-sighted-people-understand-colour-similarly/">Blind And Sighted People Understand Colour Similarly</a></h4>

              
                <p><em>By </em><a href="https://twitter.com/E_Barratt">Emma L. Barratt</a></p>



<p>Colour is generally thought of as something experienced only by those with sight. It’s often assumed that those who’re born blind can learn facts about colours — that a banana is yellow, say — but won’t have the same complex understanding of colour that sighted people have.</p>



<p>But <a href="https://www.pnas.org/content/118/33/e2020192118">new research</a> in <em>PNAS</em> from Judy Kim and colleagues at Johns Hopkins University shows that this is not the case. Instead, the researchers find that blind people have a rich understanding of colour developed through language alone.</p>



<span id="more-43991"></span>



<p>The team looked at different kinds of knowledge about colour in both sighted (N=19) and congenitally blind (N=20) participants. The research was split into three distinct experiments:</p>



<p>The first aimed to probe causal-explanatory and associative memory knowledge of real objects’ colours. Participants were asked to generate common colours for 54 specific objects which were either natural (e.g. strawberry) or artificial. In this latter group, the colour of some objects served a purpose (e.g. stop sign), but for others did not (e.g. book). Participants also indicated whether two of the same objects would be likely to have the same colour.</p>



<p>In experiment two, participants were asked to make inferences about colour consistency in novel natural and artificial objects in an “imaginary island scenario”. Participants were asked to imagine having discovered an undocumented civilisation on a remote island, complete with all that culture’s unknown objects; for example, green “Enly” gems, used for power, and yellow “Kanpa”s, used to spray odorless chemicals in the home. As objects were presented, participants were asked to guess how likely the next such one they come across would be the same colour. This task assessed the extent to which participants believed that objects within the same category (i.e. natural or artificial, with or without functional colour) would also share a colour. These beliefs would indicate that participants were able to build generalisable theories about why objects had certain colours that could be applied more widely.</p>



<p>The final experiment was more open ended; participants were asked to provide explanations as to why particular objects have their colour (eg. “Why is a carrot orange?”), and were able to give any reasons they thought to be correct. This provided further insight into the specifics of both groups’ knowledge about causal mechanisms of colour.</p>



<p>Some findings were consistent with the idea that colour knowledge is acquired through sight. For example, blind people were less likely to agree on associative colour facts; when asked to generate a common colour for a banana, only 50% of blind participants said that bananas were “yellow”, compared to practically all sighted participants. This would suggest that, at least in some cases, directly seeing the colour of an object is more informative than acquiring facts about its colour through other means.</p>



<p>However, both groups agreed more on the likely colour of both natural and artificial objects with functional colours than artificial objects whose colour served no purpose. Both blind and sighted participants also expected two natural objects (e.g. two strawberries), or two artificial objects with functional colours (e.g. two stop signs) to share the same colour, but believed it less likely that two artificial objects whose colour served no purpose (e.g. two books) would have the same colour. Similar findings were observed in the imaginary island scenario, even though neither group had ever seen the novel objects (e.g. “Enly” gems and novel cleaning devices) described in this vignette.</p>



<p>When it came to providing explanations of why object colours differed, the groups were also relatively similar. For natural objects, around a third of sighted and blind participants said that “it just is that way”, and a similar number appealed to processes to explain colouration; for example, describing how photosynthesis makes plants green. When it came to artificial objects without functional colour, both groups commonly explained that colour depended on aesthetic choices (64% vs 44%), or referred to the material from which the object was made (18% vs 13%). And finally, for functionally coloured objects, about half of both groups explained that the colour was the result of cultural convention, and a quarter of both groups said that a specific colour was used to make the object more visibile.</p>



<p>This study wonderfully illustrates that blind and sighted people share common knowledge about colour. Though the two groups differ in some domains — particularly when it comes to associative knowledge about the colour of objects (eg. bananas are yellow) — they are largely similar in their understanding of the natural occurrence and application of colours. Blind individuals are able to draw upon deep understandings of how colours function, and make inferences about totally new objects based on their category alone, in a way that closely resembles those with sight.</p>



<p>The authors take this data to suggest that those living in the same wider societal culture, sighted or blind, develop similar intuitive theories of colour which can be applied to totally novel situations. The source of this knowledge is almost certain to be linguistic, and future research may determine at what ages this framework for colour knowledge develops in both sighted and congenitally blind individuals.</p>

<hr />
<p>Crises can either be transformative or disruptive. The COVID-19 pandemic has unfortunately exposed more of the latter as countries revert to nationalistic tendencies that intensify health inequities. Monitoring from <a href="https://data.undp.org/vaccine-equity/">UNDP data</a> has shown that 1 in 2 people in high-income countries (HICs) have received a shot of the COVID-19 vaccine, while only 1 in 30 have received the same in low-income countries.</p>
<p>Whether between or within countries, health inequity is a major issue requiring global cooperation and strong health systems. The launch of the <a href="https://sdgs.un.org/goals">Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)</a> in 2015 provided an opportunity to demonstrate that global cooperation is possible.</p>
<p>Our research and policy work centers on SDG 3, the goal that seeks to <a href="https://sdgs.un.org/goals/goal3">ensure healthy lives and wellbeing for all</a>. Our research values the idea that a robust ecosystem of <a href="https://ahpsr.who.int/what-we-do/what-is-health-policy-and-systems-research-(hpsr)">Health Policy and Systems Research (HPSR)</a> will contribute to getting countries back on track towards SDG 3 despite the challenges of COVID-19.</p>
<p>In this blog, we showcase an example of our SDG-related work and discuss our reflections from our participation in a convening series from May to June 2021. Around 50 representatives of HPSR institutions across Asia gathered virtually to co-create a vision and action plan for a robust HPSR ecosystem for the region. Asia is a region that has witnessed the emergence of an HPSR landscape that is diverse yet with shared challenges and opportunities. <a href="https://r4d.org/projects/health-systems-strengthening-accelerator/">Results for Development</a> and the <a href="https://ahpsr.who.int/about-us">WHO Alliance for HPSR</a> led the co-creation process with support from <a href="https://www.acceleratehss.org/">USAID and the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation</a>.</p>
<h2><strong>From Push towards Co-creation</strong></h2>
<p>The challenge in using evidence for decision-making was a frequent HPSR issue that emerged in our discussions. The traditional model of evidence translation suggests two worlds: researchers who generate evidence and policymakers who use that evidence. Current approaches based on push models view evidence generation and policymaking as separate processes, where the evidence is pushed for use in policy, as suggested by the phrase evidence-informed policymaking. There is, however, emerging consensus that push or one-way models may even aggravate tensions between researchers and policymakers. Researchers become siloed in research without contributing to policy, while policymakers become siloed in developing policies without drawing on evidence. A co-creation model of doing HPSR, similar to the experience shared by Dr. Gloria Nenita Velasco of the <a href="https://hpdpb.doh.gov.ph/health-research-division/">Philippine Department of Health</a>, can break these siloes down. In this example, the government determines and funds the research agenda while also closely collaborating with HPSR institutions across all stages of the research cycle to address the agenda.</p>

<p>Moving away from push models towards co-creation can ensure broader and meaningful participation of stakeholders. <a href="https://www.usaid.gov/work-usaid/how-to-work-with-usaid/co-creation-usaid">Co-creation</a> is the process of bringing people together to define a problem collectively, identify solutions, and build consensus around action. Drawing on the idea of co-creation, we developed through <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/acceleratorasiaseries/home?authuser=0">a series of virtual sessions</a> the following overarching HPSR vision for Asia: “A stronger enabling HPSR ecosystem of the future that is highly responsive to countries’ needs.”</p>
<figure id="attachment_12548" aria-labelledby="figcaption_attachment_12548" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 518px"><img class="wp-image-12548" src="https://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2021/09/blog-2.png" alt="" width="508" height="285" srcset="https://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2021/09/blog-2.png 1012w, https://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2021/09/blog-2-300x169.png 300w, https://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2021/09/blog-2-768x432.png 768w, https://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2021/09/blog-2-640x360.png 640w" sizes="(max-width: 508px) 100vw, 508px" /><figcaption id="figcaption_attachment_12548" class="wp-caption-text"><div class="attachment-image--caption">The co-created Health Policy and Systems Research vision for Asia had five key components.</div><div class="attachment-image--source"></div></figcaption></figure>
<p>This co-created vision had five key components from which the participants also identified several pathways for success. A common feature of the various pathways was the idea of ensuring co-creation as well within the activities of the HPSR ecosystem. These pathways included secondments or exchanges between HPSR institutions and government agencies to collaborate on policy questions, as well as implementation research, capacity development, and research agenda-setting that bring together government and other stakeholders through networks or other co-creative mechanisms.</p>
<p>A robust HPSR ecosystem contributes to making health systems equitable, resilient in times of crisis, and more responsive to ensure people’s health and wellbeing. Co-creation can help secure buy-in, especially from stakeholders in LMICs who will be instrumental in realizing this vision of a robust HPSR ecosystem. For <a href="https://iigh.unu.edu/">UNU-IIGH,</a> this means building on existing <a href="https://iigh.unu.edu/research/accelerating-the-development-of-health-policy-and-systems-research-hpsr-capacity-in-western-pacific-region-wpr-for-health-system-strengthening.html#outline">collaboration with the Malaysian Ministry of Health</a> and other partners in Asia to sustain HPSR capacity development in the region. Likewise, the vision compels HPSR institutions in the region to co-create the conditions that can set the stage for the effective use of evidence for policies in global health. As we aim for this vision, co-creation will require us to confront the power structures that maintain inequities in health policies and systems and ensure meaningful participation from LMICs and those with marginalized voices.</p>
<h2><strong>Co-creation needs Co-action</strong></h2>
<p>The enabling HPSR vision we have co-created for Asia, the global strategy to beat COVID-19, and the SDGs are all only lofty visions without implementation in practice. Co-action, the process of stakeholders united in moving together to translate their co-created ideas into action, is equally important to sustain the momentum. It remains to be seen if our co-created vision for a robust HPSR ecosystem that supports the achievement of SDG 3 could be attained in 5-10 years. The realization of the vision will require co-action among the stakeholders to fulfill their respective commitments. Co-action among the different players in the HPSR ecosystem can enable health systems to deliver quality health services equitably as routine healthcare services and through emergency response, such as during the COVID-19 pandemic. There are no silver bullets to achieve SDG 3, but co-creation with co-action is one potential pathway if we want to turn the disruption from this crisis into a transformative opportunity which, instead of reversing our gains, moves us even closer to achieve healthy lives and wellbeing for all.</p>

<p>The protein, called neurofilament light or NfL for short, lends structural support to axons, the tendrils that send messages between brain cells. <a href="http://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/scitranslmed.abg9922">Levels of NfL peak on average at 10 times the typical level 20 days after injury</a> and stay above normal a year later, researchers report September 29 in <em>Science Translational Medicine</em>. The higher the peak NfL blood concentrations after injury, the tougher the recovery for people with TBI six and 12 months later, shows the study of 197 people treated at eight trauma centers across Europe for moderate to severe TBI.</p>



<p>Brain scans of 146 participants revealed that their peak NfL concentrations predicted the extent of brain shrinkage after six months, and axon damage at six and 12 months after injury, neurologist Neil Graham of Imperial College London and his colleagues found.</p>



<p>These researchers also had a unique opportunity to check that the blood biomarker, which gives indirect clues about the brain injury, actually measured what was happening in the brain. In 18 of the participants that needed brain surgery, researchers sampled the fluid surrounding injured neurons. NfL concentrations there correlated with NfL concentrations in the blood.</p>





<p>“The work shows that a new ultrasensitive blood test can be used to accurately diagnose traumatic brain injury,” says Graham. “This blood test can predict quite precisely who’s going to make a good recovery and who’s going to have more difficulties.”</p>



<p>Study participants were adults and mostly male, so more work needs to be done to determine if these findings apply to women, children and people with mild TBI.</p>



<p>Finding a reliable biomarker for the severity and outlook of TBI, a head injury that disrupts brain function, could improve millions of lives. Studies of <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/cte-brain-damage-football-players-top-science-stories-2017-yir">U.S. football players have brought attention</a> to the injury (<em>SN: 12/13/17</em>), but it’s a far more widespread problem. Around 55 million people globally were <a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/laneur/article/PIIS1474-4422(18)30415-0/fulltext">living with a TBI</a> in 2016, and there&#8217;s no one-size-fits-all treatment.</p>



<p>“No two traumatic brain injuries are alike,” says David Okonkwo, director of the Neurotrauma Clinical Trials Center at the University of Pittsburgh. Scientists have been looking for biomarkers of TBI injury such as NfL to develop injury-specific interventions, and Okonkwo says these new findings are promising for patients whose injury has damaged their axons.</p>



<p>“We have not had the tools to measure a specific injury type of an individual patient,” Okonkwo says. While this test probably is still a few years from use in U.S. clinics, other large research groups are looking for ways to use NfL and other blood-based biomarkers for diagnosing TBI and creating opportunities for intervention.</p>

                <p><em>By&nbsp;</em><a href="https://twitter.com/E_Barratt">Emma L. Barratt</a></p>



<p>Here in the UK, one in five hospital admissions is the result of heavy drinking. Those who drink to the extent of needing medical assistance, as well as those who are caused problems by their own alcohol consumption, are known as <em>harmful drinkers</em>. This group is characterised not only by their high levels of alcohol consumption, but a surprisingly low level of problem recognition. Generally speaking, harmful drinkers are known for being resistant to seeing that they have an issue with drinking, often to avoid being labelled as an alcoholic, which comes with a huge amount of stigma. This phenomenon is part of what gave rise to the well-known phrase <em>&#8220;I can stop anytime I want&#8221;.</em></p>



<p>However, this creates a significant barrier to treatment. &#8220;<em>If there’s no problem, what’s there to fix?</em>&#8220;</p>



<p>Researcher James Morris, alongside colleagues from London Southbank University and Northumbria University, believe that this kind of label avoidance is a prime target that psychologists can exploit to increase uptake of treatment in harmful drinkers. Their <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0306460321002781?via%3Dihub">new study</a> in <em>Addictive Behaviors</em> suggests that the solution may be as simple as reframing the issue.</p>



<span id="more-43984"></span>



<p>People often think of drinking issues as binary — you either have one, and by extension are an alcoholic, or you don’t have any issues with alcohol consumption. This kind of binary disease model belief, however, is a simplistic approach. What’s more, the threat to identity posed by such a hard line in the sand leads to a lot of psychological resistance in heavy drinkers, who don’t wish to be saddled with the stigma of being labelled an alcoholic.</p>



<p>However, this isn’t the only way to think about diagnoses. As psychologists, we are familiar with the idea of many diagnoses lying somewhere on a continuum; similarly, alcohol use problems can be seen as lying on a spectrum of severity, as opposed to being divided by a stark cut-off line. Since continuum diagnoses less resemble being labelled, it’s possible that helping individuals hold such a view could lessen their label avoidance, and therefore resistance to problem recognition.</p>



<p>To test this, Morris and colleagues recruited&nbsp;244 harmful drinkers who did not believe they had experience with addiction. Levels of problem recognition in participants were assessed via items from the Stage of Change Readiness and Treatment Eagerness Scale (SOCRATES), which is a questionnaire used to assess problem recognition, ambivalence, and progress towards recovery in those with alcohol consumption issues.</p>



<p>Participants were shown one of six framing messages pertaining to problem drinking. Two of these were based on the continuum model, and illustrated views that all levels of drinking cause some problems, and that there’s no stark cut-off point for having an issue with alcohol consumption. Another two illustrated the binary disease model, emphasising clear differences between those who experience problems with alcohol consumption and those who do not. Two further conditions were controls, which contained prose about governmental approach to alcohol consumption. In each of these categories, one condition contained stigmatising language regarding harmful drinkers, and the other did not.</p>



<p>Overall, the way in which alcohol problems were framed didn’t make a difference: participants who had seen messages based on the continuum or binary disease model showed similar levels of problem recognition. But when this message was considered alongside the presence or absence of stigmatising language, there was an effect. Those who had seen the message that framed alcohol problems in terms of a binary disease model <em>and</em> that included stigmatising language showed significantly lower levels of problem recognition than those who had seen the same framing, but with no stigmatising language. They also showed lower levels of problem recognition than those who had read that alcohol problems were on a continuum. There was no significant difference in problem recognition between those had seen stigmatising or non-stigmatising language within the continuum framing messages group.</p>



<p>The authors interpret the results as showing that alcoholic labelling avoidance was triggered in participants in the binary disease model plus stigmatising language group. They were motivated to deflect this threat to their identity, becoming extra resistant to acknowledging that their harmful drinking may be causing problems, in order to avoid the associated stigma.</p>



<p>This was not a pattern observed for those who read about harmful drinking as a continuum, which suggests that this may be a more effective approach for encouraging those who drink excessively to recognise the impacts it may have on their lives, and subsequently access treatment. By avoiding that hard line in the sand of labelling someone an alcoholic, people are likely to feel less threat to their identity by acknowledging issues they may be having with alcohol consumption, and thus more willing to make changes.</p>



<p>As such, the authors believe that public health messaging embracing a continuum approach which minimises stigmatising language would be most effective in targeting harmful drinkers, and represents a low cost method of improving outcomes in this group.</p>

<p>“Science asks the questions. / And poetry marks the spot.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>This line from “Unweaving Science,” the opening track of the spoken word album <em>Experimental Words</em>, illuminates the connections between science and art. The album, an eclectic collection of 10 poems birthed from collaborations between researchers and spoken word artists, is a celebration of the craft and creativity that drives scientists and poets alike.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The album comes from the minds of coproducers Sam Illingworth and Dan Simpson, themselves embodiments of the bow shock between the two disciplines. Illingworth, who has a Ph.D. in atmospheric physics, is an interdisciplinary researcher at Edinburgh Napier University examining poetry as a science communication tool. Simpson, former poet in residence at Imperial College London, is known for writing poems that are influenced by science.</p>





<p>Illingworth calls <em>Experimental Words</em> a “dance. It’s an experiment.” Every part of the album, from the collaborations to the “<a href="https://experimentalwords.com/videos">music videos</a>” that accompany some of the tracks, evinces the experimentation and exploration that defines both the scientific and creative processes. Even the album cover is experimental, created from an <a href="https://codepen.io/benbennybenben/full/c47bb91deb823f206703ade53bce7e08">interactive algorithm</a> that visualizes the words of the poems. Online, listeners can play around with the algorithm, developed by graphic and web designer Ben Gregory, to create their own versions of the cover.</p>





<p>The album, available on streaming services such as <a href="https://experimentalwords.bandcamp.com/releases">Bandcamp</a>, <a href="https://open.spotify.com/album/4sLT8AMakxGnBnNndErfSG?si=VCcARGXaQquFsCeMBPBAtw&amp;dl_branch=1">Spotify</a>, <a href="https://music.apple.com/us/album/experimental-words/1573981289">Apple Music</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=StoqOvvV0hQ&amp;list=OLAK5uy_k_EQLef6jRpJv5ndkR8PfHR9H1VncK84s">YouTube</a>, aims to shatter the preconception that science and poetry mix like oil and water, Simpson says. “Poets and scientists go out into the world to try to understand it, internalize it and then try and give it back,” he says. “We’re communicators and interpreters and revealers of truth on some level.”</p>



<p>Whether scientist, poet, both or neither, listeners will likely discover some truth in <em>Experimental Words</em> that resonates. The poems have wide-ranging themes, exploring humans’ sometimes-harmonious, sometimes-contentious history with the ocean; the wonders of the universe’s plethora of sounds; the perceptions and realities of artificial intelligence; and the unsung heroism of civil engineers.</p>



<p>Each piece, anchored by its own distinct spoken word style, is colored with unique sounds and music that run the gamut from satellite audio recordings of space to a rendition of a famed 1975 performance by American jazz musician Keith Jarrett.</p>



<p>“Glass Bridge,” for instance, written and recorded by civil and environmental engineer Sunday Popo-Ola of Imperial College London and spoken word artist Malaika Kegode, features an original instrumental piece written by Kegode and her sister, Handina Dutiro. A meditation on the everyday innovations many people take for granted — clean water, well-lit roads, trains, shoes — the poem opens with a challenge: “It is true that we shouldn’t walk on glass. But what if that glass is a bridge, and it is your only way to cross the valley?” A playful percussive motif that evokes a person tinkering with metal tools invites the listener to “meet on that glass bridge / in all its translucent strength / and talk about the invisible, / visible things that keep us alive.”</p>



<p>In “Mechanisms &amp; Multitudes,” a piece about artificial intelligence, computer scientist Ruth Aylett of Heriot-Watt University in Edinburgh and poet Momtaza Mehri play with synthetic and human voices for the poem’s three characters. Daedalus, the mythical Greek architect and craftsman, and PARRY, an early chatbot relic from 1972, don mechanical voices that contrast with the human inflections of <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/idea-makers-tackles-scientific-thinkers-big-ideas-and-personal-lives">Ada Lovelace</a>, widely considered the first computer programmer and who was known for her philosophy of “poetical science” (<em>SN: 8/13/16</em>).</p>



<p><em>Experimental Words</em> features poets and scientists from various personal, artistic and scientific backgrounds. All of the collaborators live in the United Kingdom — which is not surprising since the project originated as a set of live performances there. These roots in the local U.K. sphere left me curious about how the project might evolve in the future, perhaps incorporating more international collaborations or even different media.</p>



<p>Still, the album’s themes are universal. And listeners are dared to “realize that science and poetry are not mutually exclusive entities, but complementary ways of understanding the world in which we live,” Illingworth says.</p>



<p>The album asserts this message on the final track. In “Shapeshifter,” entomologist and science communicator Adam Hart of the University of Gloucestershire in England and poet Desree personify science and art as entities that “carry life, uphill, on their backs / and yet still have to beg for a sustainable rucksack.” The piece, which begins with an argument between the two disciplines about their values to humankind, concludes with the resolution that they are, indeed, one and the same: “I am a shapeshifter / Tell me what you need, / And that, that I’ll be.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/identical-twin-siblings-common-set-chemical-markers-dna-epigenetics">All identical twins may share a common set of chemical markers on their DNA</a></h4>

              
                <p>Identical siblings are used to sharing a lot with their twin, including their DNA. But new research suggests all identical twins share a common signature of twinhood, not in their DNA, but on it.</p>



<p>This signature is part of the epigenome, chemical markers that dot many spots along DNA and influence the activity of genes without altering their sequence. Identical twins everywhere largely <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-021-25583-7">share a specific set of these marks that persists from birth to adulthood</a>, researchers report September 28 in <em>Nature Communications</em>. These shared epigenetic tags could be used to identify people who were conceived as identical twins but lost their sibling in the womb or were separated at birth.</p>



<p>“This paper is absolutely fascinating,” says Nancy Segal, a developmental psychologist at California State University, Fullerton who has researched twins but wasn’t involved in the study. The research sets the groundwork for scientists to better understand “what might cause a fertilized egg to split and form monozygotic [identical] twins,” she says.</p>



<p>Despite humans’ age-old fascination with identical twins, the biological process that generates them, known as monozygotic twinning, “is an enigma,” says Jenny van Dongen, an epigeneticist at Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam.</p>





<p>Researchers know that identical twins form after a fertilized egg, called a zygote, somehow splits into two embryos during development. But why this cleavage happens remains unknown, van Dongen says. For the most part, identical twins don’t run in families, and they occur at roughly the same rate worldwide — about 3 to 4 per 1,000 births. With no clear genetic or environmental cause, the prevailing hypothesis is that identical twins arise at random, she says.</p>



<p>Early development, for twins and non-twins alike, happens amid a flurry of epigenetic changes that turn many genes on or off as an embryo takes shape. Some of these <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/study-shows-where-identical-twins-part-ways">changes may account for slight differences</a> between identical twins (<em>SN: 7/17/</em><em>12</em>). So to better understand what makes a zygote split to form identical twins, “it makes sense to look at epigenetics,” van Dongen says.</p>



<p>She and colleagues looked for epigenetic differences at over 450,000 sites along the genomes of nearly 6,000 monozygotic twins and dizygotic, or fraternal, twins. Comparing identical twins with fraternal twins, as opposed to comparing twins to non-twins, allowed the researchers to rule out any epigenetic changes that stemmed from the unusual experience of sharing a womb.</p>



<p>At 834 spots along the genome, identical twins were strikingly similar, the researchers found. These shared epigenetic marks were concentrated in certain parts of the genome, including centromere and telomere regions on chromosomes. Some marks were near genes involved in early developmental processes, including those that regulate how tightly cells stick to one another. Whether these differences have health consequences for identical twins is unclear, van Dongen says.</p>



<p>These epigenetic signs popped up in twins young and old, from places as far-flung as Finland to Australia and were found in different cell types. The shared marks are so uniquely common to identical twins that the researchers were able to devise a test that can determine, with up to 80 percent accuracy, whether an individual is an identical twin. That includes individuals who don’t know that they lost their twin during pregnancy, a phenomenon known as vanishing twin syndrome, and twins who were separated at birth.</p>



<p>“This is a very, very important finding that opens up a lot of avenues of inquiry,” says Segal, the developmental psychologist. For example, identical twins are predisposed for a variety of conditions, from left-handedness to certain congenital disorders such as spina bifida, where the spine fails to develop properly. Perhaps, for some portion of people, these conditions stem from being an unknown identical twin, she says.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Whether this epigenetic signature is a cause, consequence or by-product of monozygotic twinning remains unclear, van Dongen says. It’s possible that some of these epigenetic changes tell a zygote to split. Alternatively, these chemical marks could reflect the epigenetic aftermath of the splitting event.</p>



<p>“They could be like a persistent molecular scar of the [splitting] process itself,” says Robert Waterland, an epigeneticist at Baylor College of Medicine in Houston. “An embryo splitting in two pieces would kind of upset things,” he says, and that could disrupt normal epigenetic processes in a way that leaves a permanent mark. He gravitates towards that molecular scar interpretation, though more studies are needed to know for sure, he says.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/~r/plos/Blog/~3/PipwNVEWrvo/">How can publishers better meet the open research needs of funders and institutions?</a></h4>

<p><em>Publishers investing in simple solutions in their workflows can help to better meet the needs of funders and institutions who wish to support open research practices, research </em><a href="https://osf.io/z4py9"><em>released this week by PLOS</em></a><em> concludes.</em></p>



<p>Policies can be an effective solution for changing research culture and practice. A growing number of research-performing organisations (institutions) and funding agencies <a href="https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0237464">have policies that support open research practices</a> &mdash; sharing of research data, code and software &mdash; as <a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2020/02/2020-a-turning-point-for-research-data-policy/">do publishers</a>. Seeking to deepen our understanding of funder and institution needs related to open research, we surveyed more than 100 funders and institutions in 2020. We wanted to know if they are evaluating how researchers share data and code, how they are doing it, why they are doing it, and how satisfied they are with their ability to get these tasks done. Our <a href="https://osf.io/z4py9">results are available as a preprint</a> along with <a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.14994498">an anonymised dataset</a>.</p>



<p>Half of respondents had tried to evaluate if researchers are sharing data or code in the past and most plan to do this in the future. The most common reason for assessing data or code sharing was a desire to understand or compare the current state of practices of researchers and the third most common was to inform the development of policies, support or services with the information.<br>However, the approaches being used to assess open research practice appear to be unsatisfactory. Personal contact with researchers, such as via email, was the most common method. One respondent described the task as <em>&ldquo;A very manual process of looking at the individual articles we have funded to see how the data is shared</em>.&rdquo; For organisations that don&rsquo;t &mdash; yet &mdash; have policies on open research, beyond open access to articles, their needs are even less well met. To plan for change, as one respondent from an institution noted, they need better information on how their faculty are currently practicing open research.</p>



<p><img loading="lazy" width="606" height="457" src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/kjx5GyRCanR6AWg0VHrcoDSg1IwRHF9p4nnrsQCH1MUQhYbfHeA-1KXdNZtDTFpft2BC4mAcsEBlCiXa7PHZKtSDKmTmGO4QoDlt_bpebgHWm69zmMNi_QOtV8HFQHYIteIS8fSN=s0"></p>



<p>Overall, the results imply that the growth of policies and requirements for making research data and code available does not appear to be matched with capabilities or solutions for determining if these policies have been complied with. Measuring policy compliance was the second most common reason for evaluating open research practices. Further, there appear to be insufficient tools, or awareness of tools, to support organisations in guiding strategic and policy decisions that could benefit open research.</p>



<p>The issues that seem to be the most challenging for funders and institutions are also the most complex. Determining if research data have been made available <em>in a reusable form</em>, and determining <em>why research data or code have not been shared</em> were among the least satisfied tasks. <a href="https://doi.org/10.31219/osf.io/njr5u">Our previous research</a> suggested researchers also need better solutions for finding research data they can reuse, and obtaining data that are not publicly available.</p>



<p>Another key finding is the limitation of the research paper as the primary mode of research assessment. The evaluation of open research practices associated with specific <em>grants</em>, rather than papers, was even more important to respondents.</p>



<p>However, while evaluating research papers for data and code sharing practices will not tell the whole story of open research, the results do imply that simple solutions implemented by journals and publishers can make some progress towards better meeting some of the needs we assessed in our survey. Many respondents were not satisfied with their ability to complete important tasks that relate to finding information in publications.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Simple solutions more publishers could provide include:</p>



<ul><li><strong>Mandatory Data Availability Statements (DAS) in all relevant publications</strong>.<br>Across the STM industry <a href="https://dashboard.stm-assoc.org/">around 15% of papers</a> include a DAS. Since we introduced our data availability policy in 2014, 100% of PLOS research articles include a DAS.</li><li><strong>Supporting researchers to provide information on why research data (and code) are <em>not</em> publicly available with their publications</strong>.<br><a href="https://bmjopen.bmj.com/content/6/10/e011784">Time</a> <a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2775667">and</a> <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-021-00981-0">again</a> &ldquo;data available on request&rdquo; has been shown to be ineffective at supporting new research &mdash; and is not permitted in PLOS journals.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Enabling and encouraging the use of data repositories.</strong><br>Recommending the use of data repositories is a useful step, but making them easily and freely accessible &mdash; integrated into the publishing process &mdash; can be even more effective. Rates of repository use are higher in journals that partner closely with repositories and remove cost barriers to their use.</li><li><strong>Providing visible links to research data on publications</strong>.Many researchers also struggle to find data they can reuse, hence PLOS will <a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2021/09/wellcome-trust-awards-plos-a-grant-to-test-ways-to-increase-sharing-and-discovery-of-research-data">soon be experimenting</a> with improving this functionality in our articles, and integrating the Dryad repository with submission.</li></ul>



<p>For many researchers, to whom we know compliance with funder policies is important, publishing work in a way, or in journals, that support transparency in the availability of research data and code will be helpful in meeting their funders&rsquo; and institutions&rsquo; needs &mdash; as well as supporting reuse and impact of their research.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/transparent-ink-printer-butterflies-color-spectrum-microscale-pattern">These colorful butterflies were created using transparent ink</a></h4>

              
                <p>You’ve heard of disappearing ink. Now get ready for suddenly appearing ink. Using a clear liquid, researchers can print a full rainbow of colors on transparent surfaces. The trick is printing the liquid in precise, microscale patterns that create structural color.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/sunbirds-feathers-iridescence-heat-light">Structural colors</a> arise from the way different wavelengths of light bounce off <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/butterfly-inspired-nanostructures-can-sort-light">microscopic imperfections</a> on surfaces (<em>SN: 8/17/21; SN: 6/1/16</em>). “In nature, there are many beautiful structure colors, such as the wings of butterflies, the feathers of peacocks, the skin of chameleons and so on,” says Yanlin Song, a materials chemist at the Chinese Academy of Sciences in Beijing.</p>



<p>Song and colleagues printed structural colors on transparent silicone sheets using an ordinary ink-jet printer and clear polymer ink. The printer studded the silicone sheets with millions of microscopic ink domes, each of which served as a single pixel in the resulting image. Adjusting the size of a microdome <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/oil-water-droplets-glow-vibrant-colors">changed the wavelengths of light that the dome reflected</a> and therefore its color (<em>SN: 3/8/19</em>). Increasing the width of a single dome from 6.6 to 11 micrometers <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.abh1992">shifted its hue</a> along the spectrum from blue to red and back again, the researchers report online September 22 in <em>Science Advances</em>.</p>



<p>The denser the domes were packed, the brighter the image. And printing a medley of differently colored ink pixels across a single area created blended shades, such as brown and gray. Using the technique, Song’s team printed multicolor, photorealistic portraits of Isaac Newton, Marilyn Monroe and other famous figures.</p>

<p>“I was excited to see that somebody had used [structural color] for this purpose,” says Lauren Zarzar, a materials chemist at Penn State who has studied similar structural colors cast by water and oil droplets. “They had some nice examples that I think illustrated the versatility of this mechanism.”</p>



<p>Zarzar imagines using structural colors to create complex optical signatures for anti-counterfeiting features on ID cards or currency. Such shimmery, colorfast hues could also make useful materials for cosmetics, clothing or architecture, she says.</p>

                <p><em>By</em> <a href="https://emmayoung.net/">Emma Young</a></p>



<p>The world is full of migrants — not only refugees from places like Afghanistan and Syria, but also people who have travelled to study, or to work in another country. In fact, 281 million people live outside their country of birth or citizenship. They face all kinds of challenges, and adapting well to life in a new culture is a critical one.</p>



<p>Current thinking holds that what an immigrant <em>does</em> is important for how well they adapt both psychologically and socially. A combination of maintaining one’s own culture while also engaging in the mainstream culture is widely held to be the best strategy. This idea, known as integration or biculturalism, has informed advice and also policy-making. But a <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/09567976211006432">major study</a> in <em>Psychological Science</em> now argues that it is wrong. In fact, report Kinga Bierwiaczonek and Jonas Kunst at the University of Oslo, there is only “miniscule” evidence that any culture-oriented strategy adopted by an immigrant affects how well they adapt. As the pair writes, with some understatement: “In a world in which virtually every modern society is culturally diverse, our findings have considerable implications.”</p>



<span id="more-43943"></span>



<p>Psychologists have identified four &#8220;acculturation styles&#8221;: integration, assimilation (which entails giving up the heritage culture), separation (maintaining the heritage culture and not adopting aspects of the new culture) and marginalisation (neither maintaining the heritage culture nor adopting the mainstream culture).</p>



<p>The idea that integration is best dates back to the early 1990s. In 1997, John Berry, then at the universities of Bergen and Oxford, wrote a <a href="https://iaap-journals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1464-0597.1997.tb01087.x">highly influential paper</a> in which he concluded that psychological and sociocultural adaptation “are usually predicted by the successful pursuit of the integration acculturation strategy.”</p>



<p>However, the vast majority of studies supporting this idea are correlational, write Bierwiaczonek and Kunst. This leaves open the possibility that there could be other explanations — perhaps, for example, it’s more cognitively challenging to maintain aspects of one’s own culture while also adopting aspects of the new one, and more cognitively able immigrants also adapt better.</p>



<p>The pair also has concerns about the way some of the data has been analysed. An <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0022022111435097">influential meta-analysis of mostly these correlational studies</a>, which supported the integration hypothesis, used a statistical approach that Bierwiaczonek and Kunst feel could allow for misinterpretations.</p>



<p>When they re-analysed these 83 studies, on a total of more than 23,000 participants, they reached a different conclusion: “acculturation has a very limited association with adaptation”.</p>



<p>The pair then conducted a meta-analysis of 19 exclusively longitudinal studies on just under 7,000 people. (This included children and adolescents as well as adults who had moved to countries such as the UK, US, Germany, Hong Kong and Finland.) Because these studies included measures of acculturation and also adaptation (such as symptoms of depression, mood, school performance and social relationships) over time, they should in theory provide a clearer picture of any links between a strategy and adaptation. Bierwiaczonek and Kunst’s analysis did reveal some effects of acculturation strategy on adaptation — but they were “inconsistent and approached zero.” In other words, no helpful conclusions could be drawn from them.</p>



<p>Bierwiaczonek and Kunst argue that it might be better for policy-makers and support organisations to look to other factors known to influence an immigrant’s wellbeing, such as discrimination in the community, language barriers and social support. As they point out, “This generally puts more of the burden of successful adaptation on the receiving societies than on migrants themselves.”</p>



<p>The findings have implications for future research in this area, too. They suggest that further correlational studies would be of little help. “The field of acculturation should move on to primarily relying on investigations that utilize experiments as well as rigorous longitudinal methods,” Bierwiaczonek and Kunst argue. Given that the wellbeing of millions of people — including many vulnerable children and adults — is at stake, surely this can’t come too soon.</p>

                <!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/loose.dtd">
<html><body><p><a href="https://plos.org/about/">PLOS</a> empowers researchers to accelerate progress in science and medicine by leading a transformation in research communication. We push the boundaries of &ldquo;open&rdquo; to create a more equitable system of scientific knowledge and understanding.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Today, we are taking further steps to bring equity to publishing by launching a new policy to improve transparency in the reporting of research that is conducted in other countries or communities. Some global research has been criticised as being &ldquo;parachute research&rdquo; also known as &ldquo;helicopter&rdquo; or &ldquo;neo-colonial science&rdquo;. This occurs when researchers travel to under-resourced communities, conduct their research, and leave, often with little or poor understanding or involvement of the communities they studied, and few direct benefits to local participants.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/s/best-practices-in-research-reporting">policy</a>, implemented across all PLOS journals, aims to improve reporting of global research. Authors conducting research of this nature may be asked to complete a questionnaire that outlines ethical, cultural, and scientific considerations specific to inclusivity in global research. The questionnaire also asks authors conducting research without local authors why none have been included on the authorship list. A reminder of the <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/s/authorship">PLOS criteria for authorship</a> is also included, which states that all individuals who meet these criteria should be included in the author byline, rather than in the acknowledgements.</p>



<p>The information collected in the questionnaire will be made available to editors and reviewers during the peer review process to help assess whether the research meets the journal&rsquo;s standards for the ethics of experimentation and research integrity. The completed questionnaire will also be included as a Supporting Information file with the published paper, improving transparency in global research.</p>



<p>PLOS publishes research in over 200 disciplines and we recognise that expectations for conducting research may vary between fields. As such, at the time of launch, we won&rsquo;t have specific requirements for global research practices, beyond our existing <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/s/human-subjects-research">policies</a>. Instead, we&rsquo;ll work with our community of reviewers and editorial board members to consider questions that arise from the policy on a case-by-case basis. We hope the policy will improve awareness of the concerns related to global research, laying foundations for future development of additional policies in this area.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/s/best-practices-in-research-reporting">policy</a> has been developed in close collaboration with members of the research community across the globe, including researchers from South Africa, New Zealand, the USA, and Kenya. This has included individuals from multiple research areas, including population health, genetics, biological sciences and paleontology. We&rsquo;re incredibly grateful for their valuable input in developing the policy.</p>



<p>To celebrate the launch of the new policy, some of the individuals involved in its development recently participated in a discussion with the title &lsquo;Inclusion in global science: Preventing &lsquo;parachute research&rsquo;. The panel discussed how parachute research is an offshoot of academic narcissism and the result of pervasive views that &lsquo;<em>we know best&rsquo;</em>, &lsquo;<em>we are the experts</em>&rsquo; and &lsquo;<em>we will tell you the solutions</em>&rsquo;. They further discussed the role for publishers, institutions and funders in preventing parachute research, before noting the importance of capacity building and local ownership of research programs in low- and middle-income countries.

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/oldest-fossil-evidence-amber-spider-mom-care-young">This is the oldest fossil evidence of spider moms taking care of their young</a></h4>

              
                <p>Long before <em>Tyrannosaurus rex</em> walked the Earth, sap engulfed a spider guarding her egg sac.</p>



<p>Her corpse, preserved alongside her offspring in amber for 99 million years, is the oldest physical evidence for maternal care in spiders, says Paul Selden, an invertebrate paleontologist at the University of Kansas in Lawrence. This fossil is one of four showing that <a href="https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rspb.2021.1279">some ancient spiders guarded their egg sacs and may even have raised their young</a>, Seldon and his colleagues report September 15 in <em>Proceedings of the Royal Society B</em>.</p>



<p>Maternal care, such as guarding eggs, is common among modern spiders. Some species even go so far as <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/jumping-spider-mom-nurses-her-brood-weeks-milk">nursing their young</a> (<em>SN: 10/29/18</em>) or serving themselves up as <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/when-mom-serves-herself-dinner">their children’s first meal</a> (<em>SN: 4/21/15</em>). Because maternal care is so widespread, researchers suspected that spiders developed this behavior long before the Cretaceous Period, which began around 145 million years ago.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But this “is the first time we’ve seen evidence for this behavior in fossils,” says Selden. The female spider and her unborn offspring belong to a now-extinct family of spiders called Lagonomegopidae, distinguished by their large, reflective eyes. She and her kin would probably have hunted in trees at night.</p>



<p>Along with guarding their eggs, female spiders may have stuck around after the eggs hatched. Three of the chunks of amber contain dozens of week-old spiders. Spiders are usually solitary creatures, so the presence of multiple spiderlings side-by-side suggests that they didn’t disperse after birth, choosing instead to stay alongside their mother. </p>

<p>How long these spiders stuck around mom remains unclear. While the study “unequivocally” shows that these spiders were guarding their egg sacs during the mid-Cretaceous, “future researchers need to keep their eyes open for females with larger and older offspring,” says Linda Rayor, an entomologist at Cornell University who studies maternal care in spiders.</p>



<p>Researchers will have to look for further fossil evidence in existing museum and institutional collections. Some paleontologists are <a href="https://vertpaleo.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/SVP-Letter-to-paleontological-community-on-Myanmar-Amber_FINAL.pdf">calling for a moratorium on publishing research on amber from Myanmar</a> mined after 2017 over concerns of inhumane conditions in mines and worries that the sale of amber was funding militant groups, a situation further exacerbated by the military coup in 2021. The pieces of amber used in this study are part of a pre-existing collection at the Capital Normal University in Beijing and were mined over a decade ago.</p>



<p>That moratorium shouldn’t hinder future discoveries, Selden says. “There are already thousands of specimens — and more material than there are people available to study it.”</p>

                <p><em>By&nbsp;</em><a href="http://emilyoliviareynolds.com/">Emily Reynolds</a></p>



<p>It can be hard to know what’s going to go viral — or even what’s going to get you just a few more likes. For many, however, expressing an outraged opinion on politics has been a good way of garnering interactions, even if it doesn’t <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2019/11/13/the-paradox-of-viral-outrage-public-shaming-inspires-further-outrage-but-also-increases-sympathy-for-the-offender/">always have the intended effect</a>.</p>



<p>A <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.abe5641">new study</a>, published in <em>Science Advances</em> and authored by William Brady and colleagues from Yale University, looks more closely at how outrage spreads on social media. It finds that likes and shares&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;garnered by outrage act as a reward that &#8220;teaches&#8221; us to express more of the same.</p>



<span id="more-43939"></span>



<p>The team first trained a machine learning algorithm to classify tweets by whether or not they expressed outrage. The algorithm was trained on 26,000 tweets collected after a variety of incidents that sparked widespread outrage in the United States, such as the confirmation of Brett Kavanaugh and the Trump administration’s ban on transgender people in the military; some of these tweets contained outrage and some didn’t. The incidents were chosen because of their hypothesised resonance with different groups of people on the political spectrum; one, an incident showing an angry woman being ejected from a United Airlines flight, was non-political in nature.</p>



<p>Once trained, the algorithm was then used to analyse the entire tweet history of 7,331 Twitter users who had posted about these incidents, totalling around 12.7 million tweets. The team also gathered information on positive social feedback — i.e. likes and retweets — both in relation to outrage-specific posts and non-outraged posts. They also looked at the political ideology of both the poster themselves and their friendship network.</p>



<p>The results showed that people were more likely to express outrage if they had received more likes and retweets for an expression of outrage the previous day. In real terms, this meant that if someone received 100% more positive feedback than average for an outraged tweet, they were 2 to 3% more likely to show outrage the next day. This effect was, however, weaker for those who had been tweeting for a longer time, suggesting people become desensitised to this feedback over time.</p>



<p>As you might expect, those with stronger ideological leanings and who belonged to networks of similarly ideological people were more likely to express outrage on a political topic that pushed their buttons. However, while they showed more outrage overall, those who belonged to more extreme networks were less likely to respond to social feedback — that is, those with moderate political networks were more likely to adjust their behaviour in response to likes and shares on outraged posts. Expressions of outrage, then, are based not only on norms — e.g. what others are saying — but on reinforcement behaviours too.</p>



<p>In the next part of the study, participants engaged with a platform designed to simulate Twitter, viewing 12 posts commenting on contentious topics — Trump, Medicare for All, US immigration policy, and Extinction Rebellion. In the outrage condition, 75% of the tweets seen by participants expressed outrage, while participants in the neutral condition saw no outrage at all. The amount of positive feedback varied underneath each post, with those in the outrage condition seeing a higher number of likes and shares on the outraged posts.</p>



<p>After scrolling through the tweets, participants completed a learning task, in which they had to share content&nbsp;with the end goal of maximising likes and shares. Participants were presented with two tweets discussing the same political topics, one containing outrage and one neutral, and indicated which they wanted to share. They were immediately given feedback on their choice, with outrage posts on average getting more shares and likes.</p>



<p>Again, both norms and reinforcement impacted how often participants expressed outrage. Those in the outrage condition, who had seen more outraged posts to begin with, were more likely to select an outraged tweet than a neutral one in the learning stage, while those in the neutral condition were more likely to select a neutral tweet. But participants in both conditions were also impacted by reinforcement, selecting more outraged posts over time as they got feedback on their choices (though the effect of this was weaker in those who had primarily seen neutral posts).</p>



<p>So, overall, social feedback in the form of likes and shares &#8220;teach&#8221; people to express more outrage. While we may be more likely to express outrage if our friends or followers also do, through norm learning, those with moderate political networks are particularly sensitive to reinforcement via likes and shares.</p>



<p>“Amplification of moral outrage is a clear consequence of social media’s business model, which optimizes for user engagement,” <a href="https://news.yale.edu/2021/08/13/likes-and-shares-teach-people-express-more-outrage-online">says</a> senior author Molly Crockett. “Given that moral outrage plays a crucial role in social and political change, we should be aware that tech companies have the ability to influence the success or failure of collective movements.”</p>

<p><a href="https://bookshop.org/a/21798/9780691229003">Ice Rivers</a><br><em>Jemma Wadham<br>Princeton Univ., $26.95</em></p>



<p>I’ve always been a sucker for glacier lingo, whimsical words for a harsh landscape gouged, smoothed and bulldozed by ice. Moulins, drumlins, eskers and moraines. Cirques and arêtes. Cold katabatic winds blowing down a mountain, huffed from a glacier’s snout and said to be its spirit.</p>



<p>Jemma Wadham’s <em>Ice Rivers: A Story of Glaciers, Wilderness, and Humanity</em> leans into this duality of whimsy and harshness, cheerfully pulling readers into this strange, icy world. Wadham, a glaciologist at the University of Bristol in England, confesses that her goal is to give readers a sense of connection to glaciers, which she knowingly anthropomorphizes: In her writing, glaciers have heavy bodies, dirty snouts and veins filled with water.</p>





<p>“When I’m with them, I feel like I’m among friends,” she writes. “It is, in many ways, a love story.” And knowing the glaciers, she reasons — perhaps coming to love them — is key to trying to save them.</p>





<p>Accordingly, the book’s chapters are anchored by site, and each chapter documents a different field expedition or series of expeditions to a particular glacier. Wadham takes us from the Swiss Alps to Norway’s Svalbard islands, from India’s Himalayas to Antarctica’s McMurdo Dry Valleys. It’s a breezy read, with an eager party host vibe (“let me introduce to you my friend the glacier; I think you two will get along”).</p>



<p>While describing each site, Wadham dives into an engaging mishmash of personal recollections about her fieldwork, snippets of accessible glacier and climate science (I now know that these rivers of ice have three different manners of flow), a dash of alpine and polar exploration history, and many bits of local color. <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/otzi-mummy-ate-high-fat-meal-before-death">Ötzi the 5,300-year-old iceman</a>, Erik the Red, Svalbard’s many polar bears and wild Patagonian horses all make an appearance, not to mention the mummified corpses of seals and penguins littering the Dry Valleys (<em>SN: 7/12/18</em>).</p>



<p>An interesting thread winding through the book concerns how the focus of glaciology as a field has shifted through time. After several years of not winning grants that would allow her to continue working on Svalbard, in 2008 Wadham got the opportunity to go to Greenland instead. “Valley glaciers were no longer considered quite as cutting-edge to the research council funders,” she writes. “Instead, glaciologists had become obsessed with the vast ice sheets,” for the potential of their meltwaters to raise sea levels and alter ocean currents. Several years later, funders began to call for projects looking at melting glaciers’ impacts on ocean life and the water cycle, opening up an opportunity for Wadham to study Patagonia’s fast-changing glacial region.</p>



<p>Where the book really comes alive is in its vivid snapshots of a scientist’s life in the field: making a bleary-eyed cup of coffee in Patagonia using a thin sock as a filter; fearfully skittering across fragile fjord ice on a Ski-Doo; consuming tins of bland <em>fiskeboller</em>, or fish balls, which were mostly used for food but sometimes for rifle practice; solo dancing away a gray mood on a pebbly beach on Svalbard, with a rifle ready to repel polar bears resting nearby on the stones.</p>



<p>These recollections are honest, funny and poignant, and reveal how the highs and lows of fieldwork are inextricably intertwined. Wadham writes, for example, of dreading the “hollow feeling caused by constant sleep deprivation” due to the midnight sun and the relentless roaring of winds and water, a feeling tempered by her fierce love for the open expanses of the wild and for pursuing a “big mission.”</p>



<p>She also writes wistfully of the “communal mirth of field-camp life” where she had never laughed as much before and, less wistfully, of the heavy, claustrophobic atmosphere of an Antarctic research station with its supercharged heating system and extreme politeness over meals with strangers. Against the backdrop of Patagonia’s swiftly shrinking glaciers, Wadham comes to grips with difficult personal losses, even as she wrestles with mysterious headaches. Months later, while recovering from emergency brain surgery, she secretly begins to write about her glaciers. Still more months pass before she finds her way back to the ice, this time in the Peruvian Andes.</p>



<p>“I quickly realized one key thing about fieldwork — if you think you are there to work, you’re gravely mistaken,” Wadham writes. “You’re actually there to survive, and perform some research along the way — if you’re lucky.… In some ways I found all this ‘surviving’ a grounding process.” </p>



<p>Every glacier Wadham has studied has shrunk since she first set foot on the ice over a quarter century ago. But <em>Ice Rivers</em> isn’t focused on mourning those glaciers so much as on celebrating the peace and purpose — the grounding line — Wadham found in them. It certainly makes me want to know them better.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/rice-agriculture-feeds-world-climate-change-drought-flood-risk">Rice feeds half the world. Climate change’s droughts and floods put it at risk</a></h4>

              
                <p class="has-drop-cap" style="font-size:20px">Under a midday summer sun in California’s Sacramento Valley, rice farmer Peter Rystrom walks across a dusty, barren plot of land, parched soil crunching beneath each step.</p>



<p>In a typical year, he’d be sloshing through inches of water amid lush, green rice plants. But today the soil lies naked and baking in the 35˚ Celsius (95˚ Fahrenheit) heat during a devastating drought that has hit most of the western United States. The drought started in early 2020, and conditions have become progressively drier.</p>



<p>Low water levels in reservoirs and rivers have forced farmers like Rystrom, whose family has been growing rice on this land for four generations, to slash their water use.</p>



<p>Rystrom stops and looks around. “We’ve had to cut back between 25 and 50 percent.” He’s relatively lucky. In some parts of the Sacramento Valley, depending on water rights, he says, farmers received no water this season.</p>





<p>California is the second-largest U.S. producer of rice, after Arkansas, and over 95 percent of California’s rice is grown within about 160 kilometers of Sacramento. To the city’s east rise the peaks of the Sierra Nevada, which means “snowy mountains” in Spanish. Rice growers in the valley below count on the range to live up to its name each winter. In spring, melting snowpack flows into rivers and reservoirs, and then through an intricate network of canals and drainages to rice fields that farmers irrigate in a shallow inundation from April or May to September or October.</p>



<p>If too little snow falls in those mountains, farmers like Rystrom are forced to leave fields unplanted. On April 1 this year, the date when California’s snowpack is usually at its deepest, it held about 40 percent less water than average, according to the California Department of Water Resources. On August 4, Lake Oroville, which supplies Rystrom and other local rice farmers with irrigation water, was at its lowest level on record.</p>

Ogasa</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>Not too long ago, the opposite — too much rain — stopped Rystrom and others from planting. “In 2017 and 2019, we were leaving ground out because of flood. We couldn’t plant,” he says. Tractors couldn’t move through the muddy, clay-rich soil to prepare the fields for seeding.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41558-018-0140-y">Climate change is expected to worsen</a> the state’s extreme swings in precipitation, researchers reported in 2018 in <em>Nature Climate Change</em>. This “climate whiplash” looms over Rystrom and the other 2,500 or so rice producers in the Golden State. “They’re talking about less and less snowpack, and more concentrated bursts of rain,” Rystrom says. “It’s really concerning.”</p>



<p>Farmers in China, India, Bangladesh, Indonesia, Vietnam — the biggest rice-growing countries — as well as in Nigeria, Africa’s largest rice producer — also worry about the damage climate change will do to rice production. More than 3.5 billion people get 20 percent or more of their calories from the fluffy grains. And demand is increasing in Asia, Latin America and especially in Africa.</p>



<p>To save and even boost production, rice growers, engineers and researchers have turned to water-saving irrigation routines and rice gene banks that store hundreds of thousands of varieties ready to be distributed or bred into new, climate-resilient forms. With climate change accelerating, and researchers raising the alarm about related threats, such as arsenic contamination and bacterial diseases, the demand for innovation grows.</p>



<p>“If we lose our rice crop, we’re not going to be eating,” says plant geneticist Pamela Ronald of the University of California, Davis. Climate change is already threatening rice-growing regions around the world, says Ronald, who identifies genes in rice that help the plant withstand disease and floods. “This is not a future problem. This is happening now.”</p>

<h3>The top rice producers are in Asia</h3>



<p>The world’s top rice producer is China, at 214 million metric tons. India, Bangladesh, Indonesia and Vietnam are next. In Africa, Nigeria (6.8 million) is the largest producer. Brazil (11.8 million) and the United States (10.2 million) are also top producers, according to 2018 data from the U.N. Food and Agriculture Organization.</p>

<h4>Saltwater woes</h4>



<p>Most rice plants are grown in fields, or paddies, that are typically filled with around 10 centimeters of water. This constant, shallow inundation helps stave off weeds and pests. But if water levels suddenly get too high, such as during a flash flood, the rice plants can die.</p>



<p>Striking the right balance between too much and too little water can be a struggle for many rice farmers, especially in Asia, where over 90 percent of the world’s rice is produced. Large river deltas in South and Southeast Asia, such as the Mekong River Delta in Vietnam, offer flat, fertile land that is ideal for farming rice. But these low-lying areas are sensitive to swings in the water cycle. And because deltas sit on the coast, drought brings another threat: salt.</p>



<p>Salt’s impact is glaringly apparent in the Mekong River Delta. When the river runs low, saltwater from the South China Sea encroaches upstream into the delta, where it can creep into the soils and irrigation canals of the delta’s rice fields.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full is-style-default"><img loading="lazy" width="1030" height="685" src="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/092521_rice_inline_saltwater.jpg" alt="a farmer's hand holding dead rice plants being pulled from a paddy" class="wp-image-3103849" srcset="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/092521_rice_inline_saltwater.jpg 1030w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/092521_rice_inline_saltwater-576x383.jpg 576w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/092521_rice_inline_saltwater-677x450.jpg 677w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/092521_rice_inline_saltwater-280x186.jpg 280w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/092521_rice_inline_saltwater-768x511.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/092521_rice_inline_saltwater-872x580.jpg 872w" sizes="(max-width: 1030px) 100vw, 1030px" /><figcaption><span class="caption wp-caption-3103849">In Vietnam’s Mekong River Delta, farmers pull dead rice plants from a paddy that was contaminated by saltwater intrusion from the South China Sea, which can happen during a drought.</span><span class="credit wp-credit-3103849">HOANG DINH NAM/AFP VIA GETTY IMAGES</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>“If you irrigate rice with water that’s too salty, especially at certain [growing] stages, you are at risk of losing 100 percent of the crop,” says Bjoern Sander, a climate change specialist at the International Rice Research Institute, or IRRI, who is based in Vietnam.</p>



<p>In a 2015 and 2016 drought, saltwater reached up to 90 kilometers inland, destroying 405,000 hectares of rice paddies. In 2019 and 2020, drought and saltwater intrusion returned, damaging 58,000 hectares of rice. With regional temperatures on the rise, these conditions in Southeast Asia are <a href="https://www.unescap.org/publications/ready-dry-years-building-resilience-drought-south-east-asia-2nd-edition">expected to intensify and become more widespread</a>, according to a 2020 report by the Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific.</p>



<p>Then comes the whiplash: Each year from around April to October, the summer monsoon turns on the faucet over swaths of South and Southeast Asia. About 80 percent of South Asia’s rainfall is dumped during this season and can cause destructive flash floods.</p>



<p>Bangladesh is one of the most flood-prone rice producers in the region, as it sits at the mouths of the Ganges, Brahmaputra and Meghna rivers. In June 2020, monsoon rains flooded about 37 percent of the country, damaging about 83,000 hectares of rice fields, according to Bangladesh’s Ministry of Agriculture. And the future holds little relief; <a href="https://advances.sciencemag.org/content/7/23/eabg3848">South Asia’s monsoon rainfall is expected to intensify with climate change</a>, researchers reported June 4 in <em>Science Advances</em>.</p>





<h4>A hot mess</h4>



<p>Water highs and lows aren’t the entire story. Rice generally grows best in places with hot days and cooler nights. But in many rice-growing regions, temperatures are getting too hot. Rice plants become most vulnerable to heat stress during the middle phase of their growth, before they begin building up the meat in their grains. Extreme heat, above 35˚ C, can diminish grain counts in just weeks, or even days. In April in Bangladesh, two consecutive days of 36˚ C destroyed thousands of hectares of rice.</p>



<p>In South and Southeast Asia, <a href="https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/2021EF001992?af=R">such extreme heat events are expected to become common</a> with climate change, researchers reported in July in <em>Earth’s Future</em>. And there are other, less obvious, consequences for rice in a warming world.</p>



<p>One of the greatest threats is bacterial blight, a fatal plant disease caused by the bacterium <em>Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae</em>. The disease, most prevalent in Southeast Asia and rising in Africa, has been reported to have cut rice yields by up to 70 percent in a single season.</p>



<p>“We know that with higher temperature, the disease becomes worse,” says Jan Leach, a plant pathologist at Colorado State University in Fort Collins. Most of the genes that help rice combat bacterial blight seem to become less effective when temperatures rise, she explains.</p>



<p>And as the world warms, new frontiers may open for rice pathogens. An August study in <em>Nature Climate Change</em> suggests that as global temperatures rise, rice plants (and many other crops) at northern latitudes, such as those in China and the United States, <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41558-021-01104-8#Sec19">will be at higher risk of pathogen infection</a>.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, rising temperatures may bring a double-edged arsenic problem. In a 2019 study in <em>Nature Communications</em>, E. Marie Muehe, a biogeochemist at the Helmholtz Centre for Environmental Research in Leipzig, Germany, who was then at Stanford University, showed that <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-019-12946-4">under future climate conditions, more arsenic will infiltrate rice plants</a>. High arsenic levels boost the health risk of eating the rice and impair plant growth.</p>



<div class="wp-block-sciencenews-content-sidebar alignright">
<h3>Leaching in</h3>



<p>When grown in a greenhouse at 5 degrees Celsius above preindustrial temperatures with elevated carbon dioxide levels (representing a future climate), California rice varieties absorbed more of a type of highly toxic arsenic from the soil, raising the rice’s arsenic levels above European Union safety thresholds.</p>

<p>Arsenic naturally occurs in soils, though in most regions the toxic element is present at very low levels. Rice, however, is particularly susceptible to arsenic contamination, because it is grown in flooded conditions. Paddy soils lack oxygen, and the microbes that thrive in this anoxic environment liberate arsenic from the soil. Once the arsenic is in the water, rice plants can draw it in through their roots. From there, the element is distributed throughout the plants’ tissues and grains.</p>



<p>Muehe and her team grew a Californian variety of rice in a local low-arsenic soil inside climate-controlled greenhouses. Increasing the temperature and carbon dioxide levels to match future climate scenarios enhanced the activity of the microbes living in the rice paddy soils and increased the amount of arsenic in the grains, Muehe says. And importantly, rice yields diminished. In the low-arsenic Californian soil under future climate conditions, rice yield dropped 16 percent.</p>



<p>According to the researchers, models that forecast the future production of rice don’t account for the impact of arsenic on harvest yields. What that means, Muehe says, is that current projections are overestimating how much rice will be produced in the future.</p>



<h4>Managing rice’s thirst</h4>



<p>From atop an embankment that edges one of his fields, Rystrom watches water gush from a pipe, flooding a paddy packed with rice plants. “On a year like this, we decided to pump,” he says.</p>



<p>Able to tap into groundwater, Rystrom left only about 10 percent of his fields unplanted this growing season. “If everybody was pumping from the ground to farm rice every year,” he admits, it would be unsustainable.</p>



<p>One widely studied, drought-friendly method is “alternate wetting and drying,” or intermittent flooding, which involves flooding and draining rice paddies on one- to 10-day cycles, as opposed to maintaining a constant inundation. This practice can cut water use by up to 38 percent without sacrificing yields. It also stabilizes the soil for harvesting and lowers arsenic levels in rice by bringing more oxygen into the soils, disrupting the arsenic-releasing microbes. If tuned just right, it may even slightly improve crop yields.</p>



<p>But the water-saving benefits of this method are greatest when it is used on highly permeable soils, such as those in Arkansas and other parts of the U.S. South, which normally require lots of water to keep flooded, says Bruce Linquist, a rice specialist at the University of California Cooperative Extension. The Sacramento Valley’s clay-rich soils don’t drain well, so the water savings where Rystrom farms are minimal; he doesn’t use the method.</p>



<p>Building embankments, canal systems and reservoirs can also help farmers dampen the volatility of the water cycle. But for some, the solution to rice’s climate-related problems lies in enhancing the plant itself.</p>

<h4>Better breeds</h4>



<p>The world’s largest collection of rice is stored near the southern rim of Laguna de Bay in the Philippines, in the city of Los Baños. There, the International Rice Genebank, managed by IRRI, holds over 132,000 varieties of rice seeds from farms around the globe.</p>



<p>Upon arrival in Los Baños, those seeds are dried and processed, placed in paper bags and moved into two storage facilities — one cooled to 2˚ to 4˚ C from which seeds can be readily withdrawn, and another chilled to –20˚ C for long-term storage. To be extra safe, backup seeds are kept at the National Center for Genetic Resources Preservation in Fort Collins, Colo., and the Svalbard Global Seed Vault tucked inside a mountain in Norway.</p>



<p>All this is done to protect the biodiversity of rice and amass a trove of genetic material that can be used to breed future generations of rice. Farmers no longer use many of the stored varieties, instead opting for new higher-yield or sturdier breeds. Nevertheless, solutions to climate-related problems may be hidden in the DNA of those older strains. “Scientists are always looking through that collection to see if genes can be discovered that aren’t being used right now,” says Ronald, of UC Davis. “That’s how <em>Sub1</em> was discovered.”</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full is-style-default"><img loading="lazy" width="1030" height="684" src="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/092521_rice_inline_genebank.jpg" alt="two people in blue jumpsuits looking at rice seeds on shelves" class="wp-image-3103845" srcset="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/092521_rice_inline_genebank.jpg 1030w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/092521_rice_inline_genebank-577x383.jpg 577w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/092521_rice_inline_genebank-678x450.jpg 678w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/092521_rice_inline_genebank-280x186.jpg 280w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/092521_rice_inline_genebank-768x510.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/092521_rice_inline_genebank-873x580.jpg 873w" sizes="(max-width: 1030px) 100vw, 1030px" /><figcaption><span class="caption wp-caption-3103845">Over 132,000 varieties of rice seeds fill the shelves of the climate-controlled International Rice Genebank.

<p>The <em>Sub1</em> gene enables rice plants to endure prolonged periods completely submerged underwater. It was discovered in 1996 in a traditional variety of rice grown in the Indian state of Orissa, and through breeding has been incorporated into varieties cultivated in flood-prone regions of South and Southeast Asia. <em>Sub1</em>-wielding varieties, called “scuba rice,” can survive for over two weeks entirely submerged, a boon for farmers whose fields are vulnerable to flash floods.</p>



<p>Some researchers are looking beyond the genetic variability preserved in rice gene banks, searching instead for useful genes from other species, including plants and bacteria. But inserting genes from one species into another, or genetic modification, remains controversial. The most famous example of genetically modified rice is Golden Rice, which was intended as a partial solution to childhood malnutrition. Golden Rice grains are enriched in beta-carotene, a precursor to vitamin A. To create the rice, researchers spliced a gene from a daffodil and another from a bacterium into an Asian variety of rice.</p>



<p>Three decades have passed since its initial development, and only a handful of countries have deemed Golden Rice safe for consumption. On July 23, the Philippines became the first country to approve the commercial production of Golden Rice. Abdelbagi Ismail, principal scientist at IRRI, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/gmos-havent-delivered-their-promises-or-risks">blames the slow acceptance on public perception and commercial interests opposed to genetically modified organisms</a>, or GMOs (<em>SN: 2/6/16, p. 22</em>).</p>



<p>Looking ahead, it will be crucial for countries to embrace GM rice, Ismail says. Developing nations, particularly those in Africa that are becoming more dependent on the crop, would benefit greatly from the technology, which could produce new varieties faster than breeding and may allow researchers to incorporate traits into rice plants that conventional breeding cannot. If Golden Rice were to gain worldwide acceptance, it could open the door for new genetically modified climate- and disease-resilient varieties, Ismail says. “It will take time,” he says. “But it will happen.”</p>



<p>Climate change is a many-headed beast, and each rice-growing region will face its own particular set of problems. Solving those problems will require collaboration between local farmers, government officials and the international community of researchers.</p>



<p>“I want my kids to be able to have a shot at this,” Rystrom says. “You have to do a lot more than just farm rice. You have to think generations ahead.”</p>

<h4>Climate-resilient rice</h4>



<p>To keep rice bowls around the world full, researchers breed new varieties of rice that can endure stresses like drought, floods and salt.</p>



<p><strong>Sahbhagi Dhan</strong>: Traditional rice varieties take 120 to 150 days to harvest and require four irrigations. Sahbhagi Dhan is a drought-tolerant variety harvested after 105 days and just two irrigations. In normal conditions, it produces about twice as much rice (four to five metric tons per hectare) as other local varieties in India. Under drought conditions, it produces one to two metric tons per hectare; local varieties produce none.</p>

<p><strong>Scuba rice</strong>: <em>Sub1</em>, a submergence-tolerance gene, has been bred into scuba rice varieties. Rice normally dies after three to four days of total submergence — many varieties will exhaust themselves to death trying to quickly grow to the water’s surface. <em>Sub1</em> varieties (shown), however, refrain from this frenzied growth spurt, and can withstand over two weeks underwater, able to survive the sudden floods of the summer monsoon.</p>



<p><strong>Salt-tolerant rice</strong>: Made by inserting an area of the genome called Saltol, salt-tolerant rice varieties are better able to regulate the amount of sodium ions, toxic in high amounts, in their tissues. Saltol has been incorporated into high-yield varieties throughout the world.</p>
