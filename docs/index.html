 During cellular translation of mRNAs by ribosomes, various situations that would result in the pausing or stalling of translation apparatus at elongation and termination steps often occur1-6. Except for programmed stalling, which is usually utilized by the cells to exert regulatory purposes5,7,8, ribosomes stalled on mRNAs need to be terminated and recycled to maintain adequate cellular translation capacity9. A large source of ribosome stalling originates in aberrant mRNAs that lack a stop codon. Transcriptional errors and misprocessing of primary transcripts, as well as undesired mRNA cleavage, all contribute to the formation of non-stop mRNAs. Ribosomes stalled on the 3’-end of non-stop mRNAs do not undergo normal termination due to the lack of specific stop-codon recognition by canonical peptide release factors at the A-site decoding center. In all bacteria, a well-characterized rescue system, tmRNA/SmpB-mediated trans-translation, functions to reroute stalled ribosomes to the normal elongation cycle and termination3,4,10-12. Two additional rescue systems, ArfA/RF213-16 and ArfB (YaeJ)17,18 that work independently of tmRNA, are present in some bacterial species, but their mechanisms are not fully understood. Here, we characterize, by cryo-electron microscopy, a structure of the E. coli 70S ribosome bound with ArfA, RF2, a short non-stop mRNA and a cognate P-site tRNA. Our structure reveals that the C-terminal loop of ArfA occupies the mRNA entry channel on the 30S subunit, while its N-terminus is sandwiched between the decoding center and the switch loop of RF2, leading to dramatic conformational changes of both. Despite the distinct conformation of RF2, the conserved GGQ motif of RF2 is precisely positioned next to the CCA-end of P-site tRNA. These data illustrate a stop-codon surrogate mechanism for ArfA in facilitating the termination of non-stop ribosomal complex by RF2.

 In bacteria, ribosomes stalled on truncated mRNAs lacking a stop codon are rescued by either the transfer-messenger RNA (tmRNA), alternative rescue factor A (ArfA) or ArfB rescue systems1. While tmRNA- and ArfB-ribosome structures have been elucidated2–7, structural insight into how ArfA recognizes the presence of truncated mRNAs and recruits the canonical termination release factor RF2 to rescue the stalled ribosomes is lacking. Here we present a cryo-electron microscopy reconstruction of a ribosome stalled on a truncated mRNA in the presence of ArfA and RF2. The structure reveals that the C-terminus of ArfA binds within the mRNA entry channel on the small ribosomal subunit, explaining how ArfA distinguishes ribosomes bearing truncated versus full-length mRNAs. The N-terminal region of ArfA establishes multiple interactions with the decoding domain of RF2, illustrating how ArfA recruits RF2 to the stalled ribosome. Additionally, ArfA is observed to stabilize a unique conformation of the switch loop of RF2, which mimics the canonical translation termination state by directing the catalytically important GGQ motif within domain 3 of RF2 towards the peptidyl-transferase center (PTC) of the ribosome. Thus, our structure reveals not only how ArfA recruits RF2 to the ribosome but also how it promotes an active conformation of RF2 to enable translation termination in the absence of a stop codon.

 Chimaeras are both monsters of the ancient imagination and a long-established research tool. Recent advances, particularly those dealing with the identification and generation of various kinds of stem cells, have broadened the repertoire and utility of mammalian interspecies chimaeras and carved out new paths towards understanding fundamental biology as well as potential clinical applications.

 The neurotransmitters glutamate and γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) transmit synaptic signals by activating fast-acting ligand-gated ion channels and more slowly acting G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs). The GPCRs for these neurotransmitters, metabotropic glutamate (mGlu) and GABAB receptors, are atypical GPCRs with a large extracellular domain and a mandatory dimeric structure. Recent studies have revealed how these receptors are activated through multiple allosteric interactions between subunit domains. It emerges that the molecular complexity of these receptors is further increased through association with trafficking, effector and regulatory proteins. The structure and composition of these receptors present opportunities for therapeutic intervention in mental health and neurological disorders.

<p>The session that I was most looking forward to at this year’s <a href="https://www.sfn.org/annual-meeting/neuroscience-2016" target="_blank">Society for Neuroscience</a> (SfN) conference took place on Sunday November 13. The minisymposium titled <a href="http://www.abstractsonline.com/pp8/index.html#!/4071/session/83" target="_blank">‘Astrocytes as active participants in neural circuits: from cells to systems’</a> gathered Cagla Eroglu, Anna Molofsky, Alfonso Araque, Kira Poskanzer, James Schummers and Benjamin Deneen; all familiar names to the astrocyte <em>connoisseur. </em></p>
<p>Kira Poskanzer, chair of the minisymposium, opened the session stating how astrocytes are still today relegated to a corner of the neuroscience field. Traditionally, astrocytes are known for homeostatic maintenance, repair, protection and metabolic support of neurons, among other functions. But the focus has more recently shifted to their involvement in synapse development and maintenance. Sharing their most recent and exciting research, the speakers highlighted the diversity of astrocytes and their important role in neural circuits.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.cellbio.duke.edu/cagla-eroglu/">Cagla Eroglu</a>, from Duke University, discussed previous discoveries on astrocyte-secreted factors, reminding us that these factors have the ability to structure silent synapses (Thrombospondin and Hevin a.k.a. SPARCL1) and also recruit AMPARs to these structures (Glypican4 and 6). Astrocytes secrete many different factors responsible for the correct formation and function of synapses, and novel studies are still trying to elucidate the exact mechanisms by which these factors exert their function on synapses. Eroglu’s lab is particularly interested in the mechanism of action of the astrocytic factor Thrombospondin, and its interaction with the gabapentin receptor α2δ-1 that promotes synaptogenesis. Eroglu guided us through their latest studies, which looked into the downstream pathway of the Thrombospondin-α2δ-1 interaction. This included exciting new data indicating the involvement of Rac1, a small Rho GTPase involved in spine and synapse formation and modification.</p>
<p><a href="http://profiles.ucsf.edu/annavictoria.molofsky" target="_blank">Anna Molofsky</a>, from UCSF, started her presentation by describing astrocytes as the “guideposts” that keep brain circuits in place. This was in reference to astrocytes’ capability to store positional information while the brain grows. Molofsky identified Sema3a as a key regulator to determine astrocyte-induced neuronal circuit organization in the ventral horn of the spinal cord. Loss of this gene has been proven to alter excitatory and inhibitory synapses in motor neurons, as well as promoting mis-positioning of synapses, and finally loss of motor neurons. Molofsky is also looking into astrocytes as microglia remodelers, through which they regulate synaptic pruning.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.neuroscience.umn.edu/ProStu/facprof/araque.html" target="_blank">Alfonso Araque</a>, from the University of Minnesota, talked about the endocannabinoid regulation of the neuron-astrocyte interaction. Endocannabinoids released from medial spiny neurons (MSN) promote Ca<sup>2+</sup> elevation and glutamate release from surrounding astrocytes. Araque’s lab has studied this mechanism in the dorsal striatum, identifying astrocytes that specifically respond to the stimulation of either D1 or D2 MSNs. Astrocytes that responded to one particular type of MSN only elicited synaptic potentiation in neurons of the same type. This observation indicates that synaptic regulation by astrocytes is restricted to particular subsets of astrocytes and specific circuits. Their latest research also suggests that animal behavior may be controlled by astrocytes and the circuit-specific synaptic regulation they perform.</p>
<p><a href="http://profiles.ucsf.edu/kira.poskanzer" target="_blank">Kira Poskanzer</a>, also from UCSF, studies spontaneous activity in the brain. She is tackling the question of whether astrocytes can regulate cortical circuits during different neuronal states. Stimulation of a single astrocyte initiated the stimulation of a whole astrocytic network, promoting depolarization of neurons within that particular circuit. Poskanzer observed that Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals in astrocytes correlated with slow oscillation across the brain and this correlation occurs across behavioral states, indicating that astrocytes may be regulating these cortical circuits. During slow-wave sleep, depolarized and hyperpolarized neuronal states are key in oscillatory activity. Since astrocytes are involved in the regulation of the depolarization of neurons, she speculates about the role of astrocytes in the regulation of sleep, or even in attention or memory consolidation, where depolarized neuronal states are also crucial.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.maxplanckflorida.org/our-science/our-scientists/james-schummers/" target="_blank">James Schummers</a>, from the Max Planck Florida Institute, showed us his research on the visual cortex organization in ferrets. I must confess, it was nice to see some research done in a different animal model, other than the common mouse model. He explained the special organization that neurons display in the visual cortex of ferrets. Neurons are arranged in columns, which place astrocytes in a privileged position to regulate specific connections. Schummer’s work has demonstrated that different classes of astrocytes are specific to the circuit, and that the organization of astrocytes is not conserved across species or even across brain regions. He suggests that current models of astrocytes need to be revised in order to account for their diversity across circuits and species.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.bcm.edu/people/view/benjamin-deneen-ph-d/b16fb055-ffed-11e2-be68-080027880ca6" target="_blank">Benjamin Deneen</a>, from Baylor College of Medicine in Houston, told us how his lab uses the term ‘astropoiesis’ to refer to the subdivision of astrocytes that determines their function. They have initially identified five astrocytic subdivisions: olfactory bulb, cortex, cerebellum, hypothalamus and brain stem. They found conserved molecular signatures across the different brain regions, but they also identified consistently different antigens that allowed them to confidently subdivide the astrocytes into those five sub-populations. Astrocytic differentiation into these sub-populations is found to trigger synapse formation. The Deneen lab has found that astrocytic differentiation in glioma coincided with an increase in seizure frequency. This is potentially caused by the triggered increase in synapse number due to the sub-division of astrocytes, or by a loss of inhibition. This finding opens a new avenue of research into the importance of astrocyte heterogeneity in epilepsy and excitatory/inhibitory synaptic balance.</p>
<p>In summary, the minisymposium revealed new research into the diverse nature of astrocytes, and their functions that differ according to the circuit they regulate or the brain region or sub-population they are part of. This is a thrilling prospect for upcoming research in brain circuits, where astroglia should definitely not be relegated to a corner anymore.</p>

          <div class="panel-body">

            <p>“Uuuuggh…no, no, no, no, noooo!?” </p>
<p>Like a scene out of Hangover 3, the moment you remember that you don’t remember the night before…is gut-wrenching! It’s perfectly normal to feel riddled with guilt and shame as you wrack your brain for any evidence you may have made a fool of yourself the night before. Memory seemingly wiped clean, the best you can do to piece together the evening’s events is rummage through your pockets for clues, call up your partners in crime and prepare for the worst.  </p>
<p>In the past it was thought that a blackout from being on the bevy was strictly an alcoholics problem. However, today research shows that while blackouts are indeed more common in alcoholics, for at least 50% of non-alcoholics that engage in rapid and excessive drinking, blacking out is a real risk.</p>
<p>It was also a premature idea that alcohol disrupts brain function and depression of the central nervous system in general, but now we know blackouts involve the failing of specific networks in the brain. </p>
<p>A comprehensive and critical review of the blackout science research published in <em>Alcoholism: Clinical and Experimental Research</em>, provides the most detailed view yet as to what happens to memories when your brain is blacking out (<em>see diagram below</em>).  </p>
<p>Alcohol has been shown thus far to generally interfere with practically all stages of the memory process.</p>
<p>Short term-memory for example, can still be relatively intact when on a blackout. When short-term memory is fully functioning it tells us what is going on around us for the last 15-30 seconds or so, i.e. it tells us where we are and what we are doing essentially right now. It does this by tapping into our sensory memory (<em>see brown labels in diagram below)</em>, the super-short term memory that gives us the ability to look/hear/taste/touch something, and remember what it felt like with just a second of observation.</p>
<p>Largely stored in the prefrontal cortex , you can think of short-term memory like RAM in a computer (<em>see yellow labels in diagram below</em>), it temporarily holds the info we are currently needing to get things done.  As short-term memory still ‘kind-of’ functions during a blackout, detailed conversations are not impossible, although they may get annoyingly repetitive. And although definitely not recommended, managing complex tasks like driving are still just about feasible.</p>
<p>Yet in order to truly learn and retain information and remember the events of a night out on the town, it must be transferred from short-term memory into more permanent, long-term memory structures for storage as long-term memories (<em>see orange labels in diagram below</em>). It is the failing of this memory storage process — called memory encoding — that is completely kaput in a brain on a blackout.</p>
<p>Basically, when you blackout, memory encoding is where it all goes wrong.</p>
<p>Three brain structures in particular — the hippocampus, the frontal lobe and the medial septal — contribute to the blackout brain’s failed encoding of the night’s events.</p>
<p><img src="http://brainblogger.com/wp-content/uploads/brain-on-blackouts-alcohol-smaller.jpg" /><em>Sensory (brown), short-term (yellow) and long-term (orange) memory structure labels are colored accordingly. Red colored labels refer to those failing on blackouts. Grey colored transparent labels refer to structures connecting the hippocampus to the outlined regions of the cortex *adapted from Wetherill et al. (2016)</em></p>
<p><strong>The Hippocampus – The Head Honcho</strong></p>
<p>The hippocampus, the horse-shoe shape colored green in the diagram, is found deep in the center of the brain. Its the head honcho when it comes to long-term memories, and in the case of blackouts, their non-existence.</p>
<p>In order to successfully create a memory for long-term storage specialized neurons in the hippocampus, called CA1 pyramidal cells, communicate with other essential areas of the brain. This way the hippocampus can receive information associated with sensory and short-term memory, as well as the emotional content of the memory being processed, and relay processed information back out.    </p>
<p>Much like human’s when drunk, CA1 cells’ communication skills break down when under the influence. More specifically, it is thought that ethanol (and other drugs) activate a signal protein inside the cell called striatal-enriched protein tyrosine phosphatase, or STEP, which is found in high quantities in the hippocampus and striatum. </p>
<p>When activated by alcohol, STEP switches off proteins important for synaptic activity (the receiving and transmission of signals between neurons in the brain). STEP also results in the production of steroids that block synaptic strengthening and plasticity known as long-term potentiation (i.e. the strengthening of connections between neurons due to increases in activity that is the basis of learning and memory). </p>
<p>In summary, when on a blackout, alcohol gets STEP stepping all over the proper functioning of synapses, specifically disrupting the hippocampal CA1 cell communication needed for the process of recording a memory (encoding), and it also inhibits the neuroplastic strengthening of connections needed to make a long-term memory long-term. </p>
<p><strong>The Medial Septal – The Gate Keeper</strong></p>
<p>The medial septal is like the gatekeeper to information entering the hippocampus. It sends a type of brainwave called theta waves to the hippocampus. These theta waves change the excitement level of pyramidal cells in the hippocampus, thereby decreasing or increasing the likelihood of them being able to receive information from other structures in the brain.</p>
<p>When the pyramidal cells are excited new information has a greater chance of being processed than if the cells are suppressed. Alcohol disrupts the theta rhythm largely through suppressing the signal coming from the medial septal to the hippocampus.</p>
<p>The theory goes that without the theta wave excitatory signals coming from the medial septal, the gates to incoming information are closed, and the hippocampus can’t communicate effectively with other parts of the brain that are needed for long-term memory encoding. In fact, simply putting alcohol directly onto the medial septum causes memory loss. </p>
<p><strong>Frontal Lobe – Details, Details, Details! </strong></p>
<p>Key areas of the frontal lobe play important roles in both short–term memory and the formation and retrieval of long–term memories, including the prefrontal cortex well-known for its roles in rational decision making.</p>
<p>In long-term memory the prefrontal cortex has multiple roles, isolated to different regions within the brain structure. For example, the ventrolateral prefrontal cortex’s is specifically involved in the controlled selection of goal-relevant information. In other words, when recording a memory this part of the prefrontal cortex is involved in remembering the important parts of an event, like the specific gift you gave at a friend’s party, and not the less relevant info like the color of the pair of pants you were wearing at the time. </p>
<p>While the prefrontal cortex has shown to have reduced activity that is associated with memory impairments when under the influence, those that abuse alcohol have a very real risk of essentially drinking away the neurons in the frontal lobe, including the prefrontal cortex. </p>
<p>In fact, alcohol-induced dementia, a disease caused by alcohol abuse similar to dementia, is characterized by the “shrinkage” of the frontal lobe that is associated with both short-term and long-term memory loss.  </p>
<p>However, as of yet, it is poorly understood how even acute alcohol use can leave the prefrontal cortex’s short-term memory functions relatively intact (remember? like RAM), but impair the encoding functions on route to the hippocampus. It may likely be due to the different effects alcohol has on the different types of neurons in the prefrontal cortex that are specifically important to either long-term or short-term memory. </p>
<p><strong>The Big Picture</strong></p>
<p>Understanding how alcohol can lead to memory loss is not only relevant to cases of alcohol and drug-addiction. The malfunctioning mechanisms, brain structures, neurons and molecules involved (like STEP) are the same as those involved in memory loss as a result of anxiety, stress and trauma, as well as in neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer’s and dementia. Understanding alcohol’s impact on memory may lead to the development of therapeutics and interventions that can restore these mechanisms in a variety of diseases and disorders, and give back the previous gift of long-term memories.  </p>

<div>
<p>And it’s fair to say that they received mixed reviews. Some welcomed being better informed about the <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-35255384" target="_blank"><span style="color: #0066cc;">health risks</span></a> – including increased cancer risk – associated with drinking alcohol. Others have expressed the opinion that guidelines put the UK on the path towards becoming a <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/health/12088101/Health-chiefs-attacked-over-nanny-state-alcohol-guide.html"><span style="color: #0066cc;">‘nanny state’</span></a>.</p>
<p>As an organisation dedicated to beating cancer, we were in the former camp. Guidelines like these don’t tell people what to do. Instead, they offer information on how people can reduce their risk of cancer by informing them about the risks of drinking. When they were launched, we blogged about the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/489795/summary.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="color: #0066cc;">updated guidelines</span></a>, the weekly guideline of 14 units for both men and women, and how this could be useful in helping people <a href="http://scienceblog.cancerresearchuk.org/2016/01/08/new-alcohol-guidelines-to-help-cut-cancer-risk/"><span style="color: #0066cc;">cut their cancer risk</span></a>.</p>
<p>But how easy is it for people to do this? And do we, as a nation, truly understand the links between alcohol and different types of cancer?</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/consultations/health-risks-from-alcohol-new-guidelines"><span style="color: #0066cc;">public consultation</span></a> on how the Government should communicate these guidelines closes today.

And if we dig a bit deeper, an even more worrying gap emerges.</p>
<h3><strong>Alcohol and cancer</strong></h3>
<p>We’ve written a lot about the link between alcohol and cancer – from discussing the <a href="http://scienceblog.cancerresearchuk.org/2010/01/28/alcohol-and-cancer-the-evidence/"><span style="color: #0066cc;">evidence that it causes cancer</span></a>, to talking about how <a href="http://scienceblog.cancerresearchuk.org/2014/12/03/less-alcohol-means-a-lower-risk-of-cancer-and-hangovers/"><span style="color: #0066cc;">drinking less reduces your risk</span></a> of developing the disease.</p>
<p>When it comes to the science of how and why alcohol causes cancer, the picture isn’t too clear. But there are a few leading theories, which <a href="http://scienceblog.cancerresearchuk.org/2016/02/09/how-does-alcohol-cause-cancer/"><span style="color: #0066cc;">we blogged about recently</span></a>.</p>
<p>Regardless of the underlying mechanism, we know that 12,800 cases of cancer are <a href="http://www.cancerresearchuk.org/about-cancer/causes-of-cancer/alcohol-and-cancer/how-alcohol-causes-cancer"><span style="color: #0066cc;">linked to alcohol each year in the UK</span></a>.</p>
<p>To find out how much the public knows about the link, we worked with Dr Buykx’s team to survey 2,100 people in England, asking questions about their knowledge and use of alcohol guidelines – as well as their awareness of which health conditions are linked to alcohol.</p>
<h3><strong>Public misconceptions of alcohol and cancer</strong></h3>
<p>When our study participants were asked to name health conditions linked to drinking too much alcohol, only 13 per cent mentioned cancer. They were then shown a list of health conditions and asked to name those that could be caused by drinking too much alcohol. Almost half (47 per cent) selected cancer. But this is still a low level of awareness compared to 95 per cent who selected liver disease, and 59 per cent who selected diabetes. A large proportion (84 per cent) also recognised that alcohol can cause obesity and excess body weight.</p>
<p>But people were even more unsure when asked which types of cancer are linked to alcohol, and at what level drinking alcohol increases the risk of these cancers.</p>
<p>In the study, people were asked which of seven different types of cancer they thought were linked to alcohol. Of these seven cancers, four are linked to drinking (<a href="http://www.cancerresearchuk.org/about-cancer/type/bowel-cancer/"><span style="color: #0066cc;">bowel</span></a>, <a href="http://www.cancerresearchuk.org/about-cancer/type/breast-cancer/"><span style="color: #0066cc;">breast</span></a>, <a href="http://www.cancerresearchuk.org/about-cancer/type/mouth-cancer/?ds_kids=p7227183641&amp;adc=cpc&amp;gclid=CNWq2ZPP6soCFSP3wgodtTwF_A&amp;dclid=COSbjJTP6soCFU_QGAodBssFXA"><span style="color: #0066cc;">mouth and throat</span></a>, and <a href="http://www.cancerresearchuk.org/about-cancer/type/liver-cancer/"><span style="color: #0066cc;">liver</span></a>) and three are not (<a href="http://www.cancerresearchuk.org/about-cancer/type/brain-tumour/"><span style="color: #0066cc;">brain</span></a>, <a href="http://www.cancerresearchuk.org/about-cancer/type/bladder-cancer/"><span style="color: #0066cc;">bladder</span></a> and <a href="http://www.cancerresearchuk.org/about-cancer/type/ovarian-cancer/"><span style="color: #0066cc;">ovarian</span></a>). The graphic below shows that awareness of the risk – or lack of risk – varied a fair bit. For example, only 18 per cent of people questioned correctly answered that breast cancer was linked to alcohol.</p>
</div>
<figure class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_33000" style="width: 620px;"><a href="http://scienceblog.cancerresearchuk.org/2016/04/01/worrying-gaps-in-peoples-awareness-of-alcohol-and-cancer/"><img alt="160331-alcohol-and-cancer-awareness-with-logo" class="wp-image-33000 size-full" height="880" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/on-medicine/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2016/11/160331-Alcohol-and-cancer-awareness-with-logo.png" width="610" /></a><div class="attachment-image--caption">Infographic created by Cancer Research UK</div></figure>
<div class="pw-hidden-cp">
<p>Each year in the UK, alcohol causes 3,200 cases of breast cancer, the second largest amount after bowel cancer, with 4,800 cases down to alcohol each year. Yet only around four in 10 people (40 per cent) linked alcohol with bowel cancer, and just under half with mouth and throat cancers.</p>
<p>Conversely, over half believed that bladder cancer was linked to alcohol, when research hasn’t actually found a link.</p>
<p>Next, the participants were asked at <em>what level </em>of drinking they thought a person’s risk of developing cancer starts to increase for each type. While eight in 10 people (80 per cent) had correctly said that liver cancer was linked to drinking alcohol, the majority thought this was linked to lower levels of drinking than appears to be the case.</p>
<p>In the UK, around 400 cases of liver cancer are linked to alcohol each year (for context, there are nearly 5,500 cases each year overall). High levels of drinking are thought to trigger liver cancer because this causes conditions – such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cirrhosis"><span style="color: #0066cc;">cirrhosis</span></a> – that damage the liver’s ability to repair itself.</p>
<h3><strong>Public knowledge of alcohol guidelines</strong></h3>
<p>Taken together, these results suggest that the public may not be too well informed about the health risks associated with drinking alcohol. If this is the case, simply offering new guidelines on drinking isn’t going to be enough to help people to understand the health risks.</p>
<p>But they are a good place to start. It’s the duty of the government to inform the public of health risks, and provide these guidelines to help people make decisions about their own health.</p>
<p>The new guidelines are clear that there is no safe level of drinking when it comes to cancer risk. But our study suggests that awareness of the risks needs to improve if the guidelines are going to have the desired effect.</p>
<p>Until the recent announcement, the <a href="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201012/cmselect/cmsctech/1536/153605.htm"><span style="color: #0066cc;">government’s alcohol guidelines</span></a> had not been reviewed since 1995.</p>
<p>Our survey reveals that even  though the guidelines haven’t changed in 20 years, only one in 10 men and one in seven women could correctly identify the guidelines for their own gender, and reported using this sometimes to keep track of their own drinking.</p>
<p>Now that the guidelines have changed to 14 units per week for both men and women, can we expect the public to know what they are? Our survey suggests that, without further work, this is unlikely.</p>
<p>So it’s important we – and others – continue to raise awareness of the health risks of drinking alcohol, and especially the links to cancer.</p>
<p>By helping people understand the guidelines, we hope that people will feel they have the information they need to make decisions about when they choose to drink, and how much. And that ultimately this will lead to a healthier nation.</p>

 Complex biological processes are often performed by self-organizing nanostructures comprising multiple classes of macromolecules, such as ribosomes (proteins and RNA) or enveloped viruses (proteins, nucleic acids and lipids). Approaches have been developed for designing self-assembling structures consisting of either nucleic acids or proteins, but strategies for engineering hybrid biological materials are only beginning to emerge. Here we describe the design of self-assembling protein nanocages that direct their own release from human cells inside small vesicles in a manner that resembles some viruses. We refer to these hybrid biomaterials as ‘enveloped protein nanocages’ (EPNs). Robust EPN biogenesis requires protein sequence elements that encode three distinct functions: membrane binding, self-assembly, and recruitment of the endosomal sorting complexes required for transport (ESCRT) machinery. A variety of synthetic proteins with these functional elements induce EPN biogenesis, highlighting the modularity and generality of the design strategy. Biochemical analyses and cryo-electron microscopy reveal that one design, EPN-01, comprises small (~100 nm) vesicles containing multiple protein nanocages that closely match the structure of the designed 60-subunit self-assembling scaffold. EPNs that incorporate the vesicular stomatitis viral glycoprotein can fuse with target cells and deliver their contents, thereby transferring cargoes from one cell to another. These results show how proteins can be programmed to direct the formation of hybrid biological materials that perform complex tasks, and establish EPNs as a class of designed, modular, genetically-encoded nanomaterials that can transfer molecules between cells.

            <p>
 The functionality of stem cells declines during ageing, and this decline contributes to ageing-associated impairments in tissue regeneration and function. Alterations in developmental pathways have been associated with declines in stem-cell function during ageing, but the nature of this process remains poorly understood. Hox genes are key regulators of stem cells and tissue patterning during embryogenesis with an unknown role in ageing. Here we show that the epigenetic stress response in muscle stem cells (also known as satellite cells) differs between aged and young mice. The alteration includes aberrant global and site-specific induction of active chromatin marks in activated satellite cells from aged mice, resulting in the specific induction of Hoxa9 but not other Hox genes. Hoxa9 in turn activates several developmental pathways and represents a decisive factor that separates satellite cell gene expression in aged mice from that in young mice. The activated pathways include most of the currently known inhibitors of satellite cell function in ageing muscle, including Wnt, TGFβ, JAK/STAT and senescence signalling. Inhibition of aberrant chromatin activation or deletion of Hoxa9 improves satellite cell function and muscle regeneration in aged mice, whereas overexpression of Hoxa9 mimics ageing-associated defects in satellite cells from young mice, which can be rescued by the inhibition of Hoxa9-targeted developmental pathways. Together, these data delineate an altered epigenetic stress response in activated satellite cells from aged mice, which limits satellite cell function and muscle regeneration by Hoxa9-dependent activation of developmental pathways.

 Maternally inherited mitochondrial (mt)DNA mutations can cause fatal or severely debilitating syndromes in children, with disease severity dependent on the specific gene mutation and the ratio of mutant to wild-type mtDNA (heteroplasmy) in each cell and tissue. Pathogenic mtDNA mutations are relatively common, with an estimated 778 affected children born each year in the United States. Mitochondrial replacement therapies or techniques (MRT) circumventing mother–to–child mtDNA disease transmission involve replacement of oocyte maternal mtDNA. Here we report MRT outcomes in several families with common mtDNA syndromes. The mother’s oocytes were of normal quality and mutation levels correlated with those in existing children. Efficient replacement of oocyte mutant mtDNA was performed by spindle transfer, resulting in embryos containing &gt;99% donor mtDNA. Donor mtDNA was stably maintained in embryonic stem cells (ES cells) derived from most embryos. However, some ES cell lines demonstrated gradual loss of donor mtDNA and reversal to the maternal haplotype. In evaluating donor–to–maternal mtDNA interactions, it seems that compatibility relates to mtDNA replication efficiency rather than to mismatch or oxidative phosphorylation dysfunction. We identify a polymorphism within the conserved sequence box II region of the D-loop as a plausible cause of preferential replication of specific mtDNA haplotypes. In addition, some haplotypes confer proliferative and growth advantages to cells. Hence, we propose a matching paradigm for selecting compatible donor mtDNA for MRT.

 N6-methyladenosine (m6A) is the most common internal modification of eukaryotic messenger RNA (mRNA) and is decoded by YTH domain proteins. The mammalian mRNA m6A methylosome is a complex of nuclear proteins that includes METTL3 (methyltransferase-like 3), METTL14, WTAP (Wilms tumour 1-associated protein) and KIAA1429. Drosophila has corresponding homologues named Ime4 and KAR4 (Inducer of meiosis 4 and Karyogamy protein 4), and Female-lethal (2)d (Fl(2)d) and Virilizer (Vir). In Drosophila, fl(2)d and vir are required for sex-dependent regulation of alternative splicing of the sex determination factor Sex lethal (Sxl). However, the functions of m6A in introns in the regulation of alternative splicing remain uncertain. Here we show that m6A is absent in the mRNA of Drosophila lacking Ime4. In contrast to mouse and plant knockout models, Drosophila Ime4-null mutants remain viable, though flightless, and show a sex bias towards maleness. This is because m6A is required for female-specific alternative splicing of Sxl, which determines female physiognomy, but also translationally represses male-specific lethal 2 (msl-2) to prevent dosage compensation in females. We further show that the m6A reader protein YT521-B decodes m6A in the sex-specifically spliced intron of Sxl, as its absence phenocopies Ime4 mutants. Loss of m6A also affects alternative splicing of additional genes, predominantly in the 5′ untranslated region, and has global effects on the expression of metabolic genes. The requirement of m6A and its reader YT521-B for female-specific Sxl alternative splicing reveals that this hitherto enigmatic mRNA modification constitutes an ancient and specific mechanism to adjust levels of gene expression.

 Land-use intensification is a major driver of biodiversity loss. Alongside reductions in local species diversity, biotic homogenization at larger spatial scales is of great concern for conservation. Biotic homogenization means a decrease in β-diversity (the compositional dissimilarity between sites). Most studies have investigated losses in local (α)-diversity and neglected biodiversity loss at larger spatial scales. Studies addressing β-diversity have focused on single or a few organism groups (for example, ref. 4), and it is thus unknown whether land-use intensification homogenizes communities at different trophic levels, above- and belowground. Here we show that even moderate increases in local land-use intensity (LUI) cause biotic homogenization across microbial, plant and animal groups, both above- and belowground, and that this is largely independent of changes in α-diversity. We analysed a unique grassland biodiversity dataset, with abundances of more than 4,000 species belonging to 12 trophic groups. LUI, and, in particular, high mowing intensity, had consistent effects on β-diversity across groups, causing a homogenization of soil microbial, fungal pathogen, plant and arthropod communities. These effects were nonlinear and the strongest declines in β-diversity occurred in the transition from extensively managed to intermediate intensity grassland. LUI tended to reduce local α-diversity in aboveground groups, whereas the α-diversity increased in belowground groups. Correlations between the β-diversity of different groups, particularly between plants and their consumers, became weaker at high LUI. This suggests a loss of specialist species and is further evidence for biotic homogenization. The consistently negative effects of LUI on landscape-scale biodiversity underscore the high value of extensively managed grasslands for conserving multitrophic biodiversity and ecosystem service provision. Indeed, biotic homogenization rather than local diversity loss could prove to be the most substantial consequence of land-use intensification.

 N6-methyladenosine RNA (m6A) is a prevalent messenger RNA modification in vertebrates. Although its functions in the regulation of post-transcriptional gene expression are beginning to be unveiled, the precise roles of m6A during development of complex organisms remain unclear. Here we carry out a comprehensive molecular and physiological characterization of the individual components of the methyltransferase complex, as well as of the YTH domain-containing nuclear reader protein in Drosophila melanogaster. We identify the member of the split ends protein family, Spenito, as a novel bona fide subunit of the methyltransferase complex. We further demonstrate important roles of this complex in neuronal functions and sex determination, and implicate the nuclear YT521-B protein as a main m6A effector in these processes. Altogether, our work substantially extends our knowledge of m6A biology, demonstrating the crucial functions of this modification in fundamental processes within the context of the whole animal.

 In eukaryotes, up to one-third of cellular proteins are targeted to the endoplasmic reticulum, where they undergo folding, processing, sorting and trafficking to subsequent endomembrane compartments. Targeting to the endoplasmic reticulum has been shown to occur co-translationally by the signal recognition particle (SRP) pathway or post-translationally by the mammalian transmembrane recognition complex of 40 kDa (TRC40) and homologous yeast guided entry of tail-anchored proteins (GET) pathways. Despite the range of proteins that can be catered for by these two pathways, many proteins are still known to be independent of both SRP and GET, so there seems to be a critical need for an additional dedicated pathway for endoplasmic reticulum relay. We set out to uncover additional targeting proteins using unbiased high-content screening approaches. To this end, we performed a systematic visual screen using the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, and uncovered three uncharacterized proteins whose loss affected targeting. We suggest that these proteins work together and demonstrate that they function in parallel with SRP and GET to target a broad range of substrates to the endoplasmic reticulum. The three proteins, which we name Snd1, Snd2 and Snd3 (for SRP-independent targeting), can synthetically compensate for the loss of both the SRP and GET pathways, and act as a backup targeting system. This explains why it has previously been difficult to demonstrate complete loss of targeting for some substrates. Our discovery thus puts in place an essential piece of the endoplasmic reticulum targeting puzzle, highlighting how the targeting apparatus of the eukaryotic cell is robust, interlinked and flexible.

            <p>Chromosomes are folded into highly compacted structures to accommodate physical constraints within nuclei and to regulate access to genomic information. Recently, global mapping of pairwise contacts showed that loops anchoring topological domains (TADs) are highly conserved between cell types and species. Whether pairwise loops synergize to form higher-order structures is still unclear. Here we develop a conformation capture assay to study higher-order organization using chromosomal walks (C-walks) that link multiple genomic loci together into proximity chains in human and mouse cells. This approach captures chromosomal structure at varying scales. Inter-chromosomal contacts constitute only 7–10% of the pairs and are restricted by interfacing TADs. About half of the C-walks stay within one chromosome, and almost half of those are restricted to intra-TAD spaces. C-walks that couple 2–4 TADs indicate stochastic associations between transcriptionally active, early replicating loci. Targeted analysis of thousands of 3-walks anchored at highly expressed genes support pairwise, rather than hub-like, chromosomal topology at active loci. Polycomb-repressed Hox domains are shown by the same approach to enrich for synergistic hubs. Together, the data indicate that chromosomal territories, TADs, and intra-TAD loops are primarily driven by nested, possibly dynamic, pairwise contacts.</p><p>Nature   <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/nature20158">doi: 10.1038/nature20158</a></p><img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/NatureBiologicalSciencesResearch/~4/L37_FIZut08" width="1" />

 The majority of the Earth’s terrestrial carbon is stored in the soil. If anthropogenic warming stimulates the loss of this carbon to the atmosphere, it could drive further planetary warming. Despite evidence that warming enhances carbon fluxes to and from the soil, the net global balance between these responses remains uncertain. Here we present a comprehensive analysis of warming-induced changes in soil carbon stocks by assembling data from 49 field experiments located across North America, Europe and Asia. We find that the effects of warming are contingent on the size of the initial soil carbon stock, with considerable losses occurring in high-latitude areas. By extrapolating this empirical relationship to the global scale, we provide estimates of soil carbon sensitivity to warming that may help to constrain Earth system model projections. Our empirical relationship suggests that global soil carbon stocks in the upper soil horizons will fall by 30 ± 30 petagrams of carbon to 203 ± 161 petagrams of carbon under one degree of warming, depending on the rate at which the effects of warming are realized. Under the conservative assumption that the response of soil carbon to warming occurs within a year, a business-as-usual climate scenario would drive the loss of 55 ± 50 petagrams of carbon from the upper soil horizons by 2050. This value is around 12–17 per cent of the expected anthropogenic emissions over this period. Despite the considerable uncertainty in our estimates, the direction of the global soil carbon response is consistent across all scenarios. This provides strong empirical support for the idea that rising temperatures will stimulate the net loss of soil carbon to the atmosphere, driving a positive land carbon–climate feedback that could accelerate climate change.

Weinstein, National Institute of Child Health and Human Development, National Institutes of Health" class="attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image" height="150" src="http://blogs.plos.org/neuro/files/2016/11/29229314884_08cfd981e7_z-150x150.jpg" style="display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;" width="150" /><p style="text-align: justify;">The brain is a complex and mysterious organ, which performs many functions and the proper functioning of this precious machine is important for well-being. There are about 86 billion neurons in the brain and they interact by forming circuits. Therefore, it is critical to understand the structural organization and the neural circuits underlying brain functions. However, a major obstacle to study and understand the brain lies in the fact that it is densely composed of lipids, due to which the light is scattered and cannot penetrate inside. Thus, the high lipid content makes it difficult to image the whole brain. The traditional method to image the brain is to slice it into thin sections (µm) followed by histological staining and imaging but this is a time-consuming, error-prone process, and there is/might be loss of information as only the surface of sections can be imaged.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">However, modern approaches involve clearing the brain of the lipids and make it optically transparent so that light can pass through the brain without sectioning. There are several different clearing processes like CLARITY (Chung and Deisseroth, 2013), SWITCH (Murray et al., 2015), CUBIC (Susaki et al., 2015), 3DISCO (Ertürk et al., 2012), uDISCO (Pan et al., 2016) and many more which clear the lipids and make the brain optically transparent. With the discovery of these processes, scientists have even imaged a complete rodent (Pan et al., 2016) and its whole brain (Chung and Deisseroth, 2013; Pan et al., 2016).</p>
<figure class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_19026" style="width: 416px;"><img alt="1" class="wp-image-19026" height="210" src="http://blogs.plos.org/neuro/files/2016/11/1.jpg" width="416" />Figure 1 – Comparison between (a) normal brain and (b) cleared brain using CLARITY.</figure>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The most popular and commonly used clearing method is CLARITY (Clear Lipid-exchanged Acrylamide-hybridized Rigid Imaging Tissue hYdrogel) (figure 1) which was developed at Karl Deisseroth’s laboratory, who also pioneered the discovery of Optogenetics (Boyden et al., 2005). CLARITY uses SDS, a detergent to get rid of the lipids using electrical charges. Initially, the animal is perfused with formaldehyde in combination with acrylamide which in turn forms a hydrogel layer. The brain is infused with a hydrogel solution and then incubated. At the end of the process, CLARITY produces a structurally intact but transparent tissue. However, with CLARITY, multiple rounds of labeling are not possible and is limited to three rounds of immunolabeling. Also, after electrophoresis, the tissue expands from their normal size but return to its normal size after refractive index matching (Chung and Deisseroth, 2013). However, no loss of information due to the expansion and shrinkage has been reported.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Many modifications have been made to CLARITY including passive CLARITY (Tomer et al., 2014). More recently, Kwang Chung, who is credited with the discovery of CLARITY, developed SWITCH (system wide control of interaction time and kinetics of chemicals). SWITCH provides an advantage since it allows multiple round (&gt; 20) of labeling steps and a uniform tissue processing, thus providing access to high dimensional multi-scale information (Murray et al., 2015). Another major advantage of SWITCH is that it doesn’t require the animals to undergo perfusion and can be used both in small and big animals and even human samples and SWITCH doesn’t require any special equipment or reagents (Murray et al., 2015).</p>
<figure class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_19027" style="width: 340px;"><img alt="2" class="wp-image-19027 " height="265" src="http://blogs.plos.org/neuro/files/2016/11/2-300x234.jpg" width="340" />Figure 2: The nervous system projections imaged in the intact mouse brain with CLARITY. Adapted from Chung et al.</figure>
<p style="text-align: justify;">An alternative approach to CLARITY or  SWITCH is a solvent-based method known as 3DISCO (Three-dimensional imaging of solvent-cleared organs) which removes lipids and makes the tissue optically transparent by using organic solvents like Dibenzyl Ether (DBE) and Tetrahydrofuran (THF). By using 3DISCO, the organ of interest shrinks to half of its size which is convenient for imaging rats because of their big size, and it has been reported that there is no loss of information. A modified version of 3DISCO, was recently developed by Erturk et al. and is known as uDISCO or ‘ultimate DISCO’. uDISCO uses Diphenyl Ether (DPE), instead of DBE. DPE is less prone to radical and oxidative reactions as it lacks benzylic C-H and C-O bonds (Pan et al., 2016). Fluorescence is better preserved in DPE as compared to DBE and provides a better tissue-clearing effect (Pan et al., 2016). Therefore, DPE is more suitable for clearing process compared to DBE.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">With access to high resolution microscopes, like 2-photon or light sheet microscopy, it is now possible to image a complete brain within a matter of hours. A recent development in microscopy known as expansion microscopy (Chen et al., 2015) can also be used to image cleared tissues which is based on the infusion of Sodium polyacrylate into the tissue. Interestingly, this molecule is also used in baby diapers and as a result the diapers expand due to diffusion of liquid into it. Based on the same principle, expansion microscopy also expands the tissue samples by 100 folds without changing the molecular structures and it has been used to image cells and synapses in the mouse hippocampus (Chen et al., 2015)<span style="font-size: small;"> </span>and also has been used to image RNA structure (Chen et al., 2016).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img alt="Table 1" class="wp-image-19028 aligncenter" height="195" src="http://blogs.plos.org/neuro/files/2016/11/Table-1-300x126.jpg" width="464" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The advent of clearing techniques and advanced microscopy system has made possible to image the whole brain in pathological conditions in order to deeply understand the underlying aberrant changes occurring at the level of neural networks and connections. Recently, clearing methods have been successfully used to image brains in severe disorders such as Alzheimer’s disease (Ando et al., 2014) and multiple sclerosis (Spence et al., 2014). With these techniques, it would now be possible to comprehend some of the brain secrets and to unveil how this beautiful organ works.</p>

<p>Much attention has been focused recently on whether brain training programmes have the far-reaching benefits claimed by their commercial purveyors. Brain training usually involves completing exercises on computer to strengthen your working memory – essentially your ability to hold in mind and process multiple items of information at once (“cognitive training” would be a more apt name). The argument put forward by brain training companies like Lumosity and Posit Science, is that working memory is such a fundamental mental process that if you boost your working memory capacity through training, then you will experience wide-ranging benefits, even in ostensibly unrelated activities, such as in your performance at work. However, <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2016/10/07/brain-training-exercises-just-make-you-better-at-brain-training-exercises/">a comprehensive review</a> published earlier this year concluded that there is in fact inadequate evidence to justify such bold claims. Now <a href="http://link.springer.com/article/10.3758%2Fs13421-016-0629-4">a study</a> in <em>Memory and Cognition</em> brings even worse news for brain training enthusiasts – compared to control conditions, working memory training was actually found to <em>worsen</em> performance on a test of recognition memory.<span id="more-14518"></span></p>
<p>Laura Matzen and her colleagues recruited 86 male and female participants (average age 37), all employees at the Sandia National Laboratories in Albuquerque, New Mexico. In the first week of the study, the researchers tested the participants’ baseline performance on recognition memory (the ability to study several dozen words, one at a time, and then judge in a subsequent test which words they’d seen and which were new); and on verbal and spatial working memory (this involved recalling sequences of symbols while also judging whether sentences made sense or not, and the spatial version involved remembering the order and location of shapes in a grid).</p>
<p>The next three weeks were spent training. Some of the participants were allocated to working memory training, which involved spending half an hour a day, four days a week, on a version of the <em>n</em>-back task (the kind of task that features in many brain-training programmes). Participants had to look at streams of letters on a screen and look out for whenever the current item was the same as the one a certain number (<em>n</em>) of items earlier. The better participants performed, the harder the task became by requiring they attend to earlier items in the sequence. Other participants were allocated to three weekly sessions of mental imagery training, in which they were taught, and practised, converting to-be-remembered words into memorable images. Finally, the remainder of the participants were allocated to a no-training control condition.</p>
<p>During the fifth and final week of the study, all participants repeated the original baseline tests of working memory and recognition memory, and the researchers compared the participants’ performance with their earlier baseline. The researchers also asked participants about what learning strategies they’d used in these final tests, if any, such as mental rehearsal of to-be-remembered words or imagery techniques.</p>
<p>All the participants showed improvement in the later test of working memory, but this improvement was no greater in the working memory training group compared with the other groups, which means there was no evidence that working memory training had any specific benefits on working memory performance. But arguably more worrying still for brain training advocates is that whereas the control group showed equal performance on the later recognition memory test compared with baseline, and the imagery training group showed improvements compared with baseline, the working memory training group actually deteriorated in their recognition memory performance.</p>
<p>Why would working memory training worsen recognition memory performance? Some clues come from the participants’ comments about their use of strategies – those in the working memory training group were more likely than others to say they used a “shallow” strategy such as simple mental repetition (not very effective when studying dozens of words), or no strategy at all. The researchers speculated that perhaps the experience of working memory training discourages us from using effective strategies, maybe because it encourages a confidence in and reliance on one’s basic memory processes.</p>
<p>A potential criticism of the study is that the working memory training was much more time consuming that the mental imagery training, potentially leaving the participants in the working memory condition more tired and demotivated by the time of the final tests. However, there was little evidence to support this interpretation – for example, drop out from the study was no greater in the working memory condition than other groups, and remember participants who completed the working memory training showed comparable performance to others on the final tests of working memory.</p>
<p>This is just one study with a relatively small sample and it only used one kind of test to measure recognition memory performance, so it shouldn’t be treated as decisive evidence. However, Matzen and her team said their findings are worrying because recognition memory performance is so important to many real-life challenges, especially in educational settings. “The results present a cautionary tale about unintended consequences arising from cognitive training,” they said. “Even if participants improve on the trained task, the training may impact their performance on untrained tasks in unforeseen ways.”</p>

Recognizing this growing importance, <em>BMC Public Health</em> is expanding its global health content, and welcomes submissions in a wide range of multidisciplinary areas that coalesce around the research and practice of global health.</p>
<p><strong>To mark this new global health emphasis, Professor Mackey discusses why he became passionate about global health, his research interests, and where he sees the field of global health moving in the 21st century.</strong></p>
<p><em><strong>What inspired you to become a global health practitioner?</strong></em></p>

<p>As a child, my earliest memories were those living in foreign countries. Though born in the United States, my childhood was mostly spent living abroad due to my father’s work (who was a civil servant for the U.S. military). This included tours in the Philippines, Greece, Germany, and visiting Japan every year to see my maternal grandparents and relatives. It wasn’t until middle school that I would return to the United States, then experiencing the strange feeling of being a foreigner in my own “home” country.</p>
<p>However, the most profound impact of this experience was how it widened my perspective on the shared challenges we face as a global society and how it taught me that health is a common value that transcends national boundaries. Regardless of the different communities and countries I lived in and visited, all had a longing for the “attainment” of health and wellness, yet many did not have the means to ensure a healthier present or future.</p>
<p>This was especially true when I returned to the United States. We moved back to a community that had radically changed and shifted in socioeconomic demographics. The difference was drastic with our neighborhoods plagued with violence, substance abuse, failing schools, and all the signs of poverty, including lack of healthcare access and poor health outcomes.</p>
<p>This experience led me to a career in global health. I realized that improving population health through research, advocacy, and policy making is something that all communities need, whether it be local or global.</p>
<p><strong><em>What are your research interests in global health?</em></strong></p>
<p>My primary research interests are looking at the impact of policy and governance on a variety of domestic and global health issues. This interest reflects my multidisciplinary background, which includes degrees in political science, health policy and law, and a doctorate in Global Public Health. It is also informed by where and the people I have worked with, which includes over 10 years’ experience in the private sector, my current career in academia, and consulting for organizations such as the World Health Organization (“WHO”) and the U.S. Department of State, among others.</p>
<p>The reason why I am so interested in policy and governance is that it impacts everything around us. Global health programs cannot be successful without appropriate governance that enables them to effectuate sustainable change or prevent health emergencies. We are seeing this play out now with widespread scrutiny and calls for reform of the WHO following the 2014 Ebola outbreak, a topic I explore in a recent <a href="https://bmcinfectdis.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12879-016-2016-y">article</a> published in <em>BMC Infectious Diseases.</em></p>
<p>Similarly, health interventions cannot be effective unless policy frameworks support their design and implementation.  Simply put, if you don’t understand the policy environment, then you may not understand why your public health program, research, or intervention is working or not working, or why it may not be translating to have the desired impact.</p>
<p>Studying policy also allows me to traverse a wide-range of topics and interests in domestic and global health, keeping me both interested and busy at all times.  This includes publishing on subjects including pharmaceutical regulation, eHealth, substance abuse, environmental health, drug safety and quality, innovation and intellectual property, infectious diseases, cancer policy, health and migration, health diplomacy, and health corruption.</p>
<p><strong><em>Where do you see the field of global health moving towards in the 21<sup>st</sup> century?</em></strong></p>
<p>The strength of global health and why it represents a field of study that can address our most pressing global challenges (from the threat of infectious disease outbreaks to the impact of climate change on planetary health) is its multidisciplinary nature.  Global health should be a “safe space” where all types of stakeholders and disciplines can come together to address complex problems from their own unique perspectives but sharing the same goal of advancing human health and development.</p>
<p>A unifying governance framework that can bring us together towards advancing global health are the United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), many of which are cross-cutting and encourage partnership among different sectors of global society.  For this reason, the journal welcomes submissions that assess key component of the SDGs (including measuring progress to SDG goals, assessing appropriate indicators, and thinking creatively about how the SDGs are a global instrument that can effectuate positive and sustainable change).</p>
<p>Technology can also serve as an agnostic and unifying structure that can address health problems that are borderless.  This includes the emergence of eHealth as its own distinct field of study.  Hence, we would encourage submissions that look at new digital tools, solutions, methods, and interventions that can improve population health.  The potential to leverage eHealth to advance global health are virtually endless, though these technologies need to think about public health as a priority not a secondary outcome.</p>
<p>Finally, we welcome submissions and research addressing global health challenges in low and low-middle-income countries.  As a global academic community, we need more visibility to the acute challenges of communities who stand to benefit the most from the promotion of global health.</p>

            Airline travel during the holidays is one big headache. But for some people, “airplane headache” is a truly painful experience. The headache occurs during take-off and landing, is unique to plane travel, and is not associated with other conditions. The pain is severe, with a jabbing or stabbing quality, and located on one side of the head (usually around the eye sockets or forehead).

<p>Many of our relationships begin with that moment when our eyes meet and we realise the other person is looking right at us. Pause for a second and consider the intensity of the situation, the near-magical state of two brains simultaneously processing one another, each aware of being, at that very instant, the centre of the other’s mental world. Psychologists have made some surprising discoveries about the way that mutual gaze, or the lack of it, affects us mentally and physically and how we relate to each other. Here we digest the fascinating psychology of eye contact, from tiny babies’ sensitivity to gaze to the hallucination-inducing effects of prolonged eye-staring.</p>
<p><span id="more-14240"></span></p>
<p>Our sensitivity to eye contact begins incredibly early. <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/11293433_Eye_contact_detection_in_humans_from_birth">Infants of just two days of age prefer looking at faces that gaze back at them</a>. Similarly, <a href="http://www.pnas.org/content/111/45/16208">recordings of the brain activity of four-month-olds</a> show that they process gazing faces more deeply than faces that are looking away; and at 7-months, infants’ brains process eye contact differently from averted gaze even when the eyes are shown for just 50ms – far too quick for any kind of conscious awareness.</p>
<p>Most children recognise the social significance of eye contact, but they seem to take it too far. At the age of three and four, for instance, they often believe that so long as they cover their eyes – thus preventing eye contact – that they will be completely hidden from view. In fact, <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2012/10/23/why-do-children-hide-by-covering-their-eyes/">children will often claim to be hidden even if they simply avert their gaze while another person looks at them</a>.</p>
<p>Children with autism often show a noticeable lack of eye contact and <a href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.2044-835X.1995.tb00687.x/abstract">part of the reason</a> is their difficulty understanding the social significance of another person’s gaze, and that they <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19414711">find it difficult to infer other people’s mental state from their eyes</a>.</p>
<p>As adults, locking eyes with another person <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2014/09/26/eye-contact-makes-us-more-aware-of-our-own-bodies/">immediately triggers in us a state of increased self-consciousness</a>. Researchers showed this by asking participants to rate their own emotional reactions to various positive and negative images, some of which were preceded by a face staring straight at them, others by a face with gaze averted. Participants had more insight into their own emotional reactions (which were measured objectively through the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrodermal_activity">galvanic skin response</a>) after they’d made eye contact with a face. “Our results support the view that human adults’ bodily awareness becomes more acute when they are subjected to another’s gaze,” the researchers said.</p>
<p>In fact, eye contact is such an intense experience <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2016/11/18/why-its-hard-to-talk-and-make-eye-contact-at-the-same-time/">it even seems to consume extra brain power</a>, making it difficult to perform other challenging mental tasks at the same time. This year a pair of Japanese researchers tested participants on a verb generation task while at the same time they looked at a realistic on-screen face that was either making eye contact with them or had its gaze averted. Making eye contact impaired the participants’ performance on the hardest version of the verb generation task, presumably because it consumed spare brain power that might otherwise have been available to support performance on the verbal task.</p>
<p>Unlike adults, who mostly know instinctively to break eye contact to help concentrate on what they’re saying, children will tend to maintain gaze even when asked a difficult question. <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2006/01/05/helping-children-by-teaching-them-to-look-away/">Developmental psychologists have shown that children can benefit from being trained to avert their gaze to help them think things through more clearly</a>.</p>
<p>Whether or not other people make eye contact with us changes the way that we think about them and their feelings. For example, <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15615320">we are more likely to remember faces with which we’ve experienced mutual gaze</a>, and <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15755215">we consider displays of anger and joy to be more intense when shown by a person making eye contact</a>. In fact, when a person or human-like entity (such as a human face morphed with a doll) makes eye contact with us, <a href="http://psp.sagepub.com/content/42/12/1666.full">we assume that he/she/it has a more sophisticated mind</a> and a greater ability to act in the world, such as to show self-control and act morally, and a greater desire for social contact.</p>
<p>Indeed, such is the importance of eye contact to socialising that we tend to form rather low opinions of people who persistently avoid our gaze, assuming that they are <a href="http://psycnet.apa.org/psycinfo/1992-34932-001">less sincere</a> and, at least if they’re female, <a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0191886996001481">less conscientious</a>. Conversely, <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27643789">we’re more likely to believe statements made by a person who looks us in the eye</a>. Yet <a href="http://www.psychopathicwritings.com/2011/06/truth-or-myth-psychopathic-stare-part-5.html">maintaining eye contact with <em>too much</em> intensity is seen as a feature of psychopaths</a>.</p>
<p>To try to identity the optimum length of unbroken eye contact to make, psychologists recruited participants at London’s Science Museum and asked them to rate how comfortable they found different lengths of eye contact made by faces shown in video clips, ranging from between 100ms (a tenth of a second) to 10,300ms (just over ten seconds). <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2016/07/07/psychologists-have-identified-the-length-of-eye-contact-that-people-find-most-comfortable/">On average, the participants were most comfortable with eye contact that lasted just over three seconds</a>.</p>
<p>When it comes to deciding whether we trust another person, it turns out that it’s not only a question of how much eye contact they make, but also what we see in their eyes. Remarkably, <a href="http://pss.sagepub.com/content/early/2015/07/30/0956797615588306.full">it seems that we pay attention at a subconscious level to the behaviour of their pupils</a>, and if they dilate – a sign of attraction and emotional arousal – we judge them to be more trustworthy, whereas if they constrict – a sign of fear or feeling threatened – then we judge them less trustworthy. Also, when we trust a partner with dilating pupils, our own pupils tend to mimic theirs and show similar dilation.</p>
<p>We think poorly of conversation partners who consistently avoid eye contact, but it is our feelings of belonging that are hurt when a stranger looks our way and deliberately avoids meeting our eyes – an experience captured by the German expression “wie Luft behandeln”, which means to be looked at as though air. <a href="http://pss.sagepub.com/content/early/2012/01/13/0956797611427921.full">Psychologists demonstrated this in a field study on their university campus</a>, in which they subjected passersby to the “wie Luft behandeln” experience after which they reported feeling disconnected from others.</p>
<p>Thankfully we seem to have an inbuilt defence mechanism to avoid these feelings of disconnection when we’re already feeling rejected. <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2016/08/16/after-rejection-your-brain-performs-this-subtle-trick-to-help-you-make-friends/">Psychologists showed us this</a> by prompting some participants to feel ostracised in a game of online ball passing, and then asking them to judge whether a series of faces were looking right at them or not. Compared with control participants, those feeling ostracised were more likely to believe that other faces were making eye contact with them, even if in truth their eyes were slightly averted.</p>
<p>And finally, it seems extreme eye contact can lead to some very strange psychological effects. If you and a partner look into each other’s eyes for 10 minutes while sitting in a dimly lit room, you are likely to experience odd sensations that resemble mild “dissociation” – a psychological term for when people lose their normal connection with reality. <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2015/08/18/weird-things-start-to-happen-when-you-stare-into-someones-eyes-for-10-minutes/">When the Italian psychologist Giovanni Caputo tested these effects for a paper published in 2015</a>, he found that participants experienced odd feelings of time slowing down, sounds seeming quiet or loud, and 90 per cent said they’d seen some deformed facial features, 75 per cent said they’d seen a monster, 50 per cent said they saw aspects of their own face in their partner’s face, and 15 per cent said they’d seen a relative’s face.</p>
<p>The meeting of minds and souls that occurs through eye contact can be a wonderful thing, but is perhaps best practised in moderation, or at least in full daylight!</p>

 Wild and managed pollinators provide a wide range of benefits to society in terms of contributions to food security, farmer and beekeeper livelihoods, social and cultural values, as well as the maintenance of wider biodiversity and ecosystem stability. Pollinators face numerous threats, including changes in land-use and management intensity, climate change, pesticides and genetically modified crops, pollinator management and pathogens, and invasive alien species. There are well-documented declines in some wild and managed pollinators in several regions of the world. However, many effective policy and management responses can be implemented to safeguard pollinators and sustain pollination services.

 Platelet-derived growth factor receptor α (PDGFRα) exhibits divergent effects in skeletal muscle. At physiological levels, signalling through this receptor promotes muscle development in growing embryos and angiogenesis in regenerating adult muscle. However, both increased PDGF ligand abundance and enhanced PDGFRα pathway activity cause pathological fibrosis. This excessive collagen deposition, which is seen in aged and diseased muscle, interferes with muscle function and limits the effectiveness of gene- and cell-based therapies for muscle disorders. Although compelling evidence exists for the role of PDGFRα in fibrosis, little is known about the cells through which this pathway acts. Here we show in mice that PDGFRα signalling regulates a population of muscle-resident fibro/adipogenic progenitors (FAPs) that play a supportive role in muscle regeneration but may also cause fibrosis when aberrantly regulated. We found that FAPs produce multiple transcriptional variants of Pdgfra with different polyadenylation sites, including an intronic variant that codes for a protein isoform containing a truncated kinase domain. This variant, upregulated during regeneration, acts as a decoy to inhibit PDGF signalling and to prevent FAP over-activation. Moreover, increasing the expression of this isoform limits fibrosis in vivo in mice, suggesting both biological relevance and therapeutic potential of modulating polyadenylation patterns in stem-cell populations.

            <p>Body mass index (BMI) has been linked to inflammation, and systemic inflammation has been linked to decreased cognition. Now, a new study directly links a high BMI to lower cognitive functioning. The current study, published in the journal <em>Brain, Behavior, and Immunity</em>, is the first step in identifying a biologically plausible mechanism for the connection between BMI and cognition.    </p>
<p>The authors evaluated 2 cohorts of people aged 50 years and older from the English Longitudinal Study of Aging. One group contained 9000 people and the other contained approximately 12,500.</p>
<p>When the authors correlated BMI, inflammatory markers, and cognition over a 6-year period, the results in both groups were the same: higher BMI was associated with greater cognitive decline. </p>
<p>Specifically, the higher the BMI at the beginning of the study, the greater increase in levels of inflammatory markers (specifically, C-reactive protein [CRP]) over the next 4 years. The change in CRP predicted greater decline in memory and executive functioning over the following 2 years (a total of 6 years from the start of the study.) Established literature already links inflammation to cognitive decline, but these findings take it a step further by highlighting the role of BMI in systemic inflammation.</p>
<p>Physical activity and body mass are related to cognitive function in adults. BMI is a function of body mass (i.e., weight) and height, and most data reveal an inverse relationship between physical activity and BMI. Likewise, regular exercise has been shown to prevent cognitive decline in adults who are middle aged and older. </p>
<p>The relationship between physical activity and BMI, however, is nuanced because BMI does not account for a person’s amounts of body fat or muscle mass, both of which can skew the calculation. Still, the general trends are intuitive: engage in more physical activity, decrease body weight, lower BMI, and improve cognition.</p>
<p>In the current study, BMI, by way of inflammation, predicted cognitive decline. While no absolute criteria are reported for preventing cognitive decline, the authors provide one more reason – if one is even needed – to maintain an appropriate body weight and levels of physical activity. Changes in cognition related to aging often take years – even decades – to appear, so a healthy BMI at younger ages may prevent cognitive changes years later.</p>
<p>A recent landmark study indicated that healthy lifestyle habits were cumulative in their protective effects against cognitive decline, asserting that exercise and maintaining health body weight were important for 20 years before the onset of cognitive decline.</p>
<p>Healthy BMI is correlated to decreased risks of many diseases and conditions that affect most of the major body’s major organ systems. Now, simply reducing BMI may be a simple, low-cost intervention to decrease the burden of cognitive impairment.</p>
