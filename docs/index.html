              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/dna-why-covid-19-hits-differently">DNA is providing new clues to why COVID-19 hits people differently</a></h4>

              
                <p>Since the beginning of the pandemic, the mercurial nature of the coronavirus has been on display. Some people get mild, cold-like illnesses or even have no symptoms when infected, while other people become severely ill and may die from COVID-19.</p>



<p>What determines that fate is complicated and somewhat mysterious. Researchers are looking at a wide variety of factors that may play a role — everything from demographics to preexisting conditions to vaccination status and even genetic clues.</p>





<p>Researchers know that older people are more likely to have severe complications of the disease. The unvaccinated, too, have an increased risk of hospitalization and death compared with people who have gotten their COVID shots.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Unvaccinated people age 50 and older were <a href="https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/?CDC_AA_refVal=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cdc.gov%2Fcoronavirus%2F2019-ncov%2Fcases-updates%2Fcases-in-us.html#rates-by-vaccine-status" target="_blank" rel="noopener">12 times as likely to die</a> from COVID-19 as vaccinated people who had gotten two or more booster shots, August data from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention indicate. For instance, among the unvaccinated there were 5.46 deaths per 100,000 people on August 28, compared with 0.49 per 100,000 for those with two-plus boosters.</p>



<p>Even among the vaxxed the number of shots counts. That same month, people 50 and older who got their first two shots and only one booster were nearly three times as likely to die (1.27 deaths per 100,000) as their peers who got two or more boosters.&nbsp;</p>



<h4>Preexisting health problems</h4>



<p>A litany of <a href="https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/?CDC_AA_refVal=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cdc.gov%2Fcoronavirus%2F2019-ncov%2Fcases-updates%2Fcases-in-us.html#underlying-med-conditions" target="_blank" rel="noopener">health conditions</a>, including heart disease, kidney disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), diabetes and obesity, increase the risk of bad outcomes from COVID-19 at any age. Yet some types of <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/covid-asthma-allergic-immune-response">asthma may protect </a>against the disease (<em>SN: 5/2/22</em>).&nbsp;</p>



<p>Cancer patients are among the most vulnerable to COVID-19. But even among cancer patients, some people are more vulnerable than others.&nbsp;</p>



<p><a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamaoncology/fullarticle/2797979" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Cancer patients who are immunosuppressed</a>, either because of problems with their immune systems or because they are taking immune-dampening drugs, are more likely to get severe COVID-19, die or develop cytokine storm — a whirlwind of immune chemicals that can set off tissue- and organ-damaging inflammation, researchers report November 3 in <em>JAMA Oncology</em>. The effect was worse for immunosuppressed people who were getting immunotherapy for cancer, compared with people getting other chemotherapies or no treatment.&nbsp;</p>





<p>That means cancer patients with weakened immune systems “should be very careful and adopt strict measures to prevent them from catching COVID-19,” says study coauthor Chris Labaki, a cancer researcher at Dana-Farber Cancer Institute in Boston.</p>



<p>“Wear masks as much as possible, clean everything, including washing your hands. Maybe don’t go to crowded public places where the chance of catching COVID-19 might be higher.” People who have cancer patients in their lives may also want to take more care to avoid the coronavirus, he says.</p>



<h4>Genetic clues</h4>



<p>But young and otherwise healthy people may get really sick, be hospitalized or even die from COVID-19 too. It’s hard to predict who might succumb, but researchers are searching for genetic clues.</p>



<p>Some studies have found that versions of<a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coronavirus-some-neandertal-genes-protection-severe-covid-19"> genes inherited from Neandertals may protect against COVID-19</a>, while other genetic heirlooms passed down from Neandertals can<a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/covid-19-coronavirus-neandertal-genes-risk-severe-infection"> up the risk of severe disease</a> (<em>SN: 2/17/21; SN: 10/2/20</em>).&nbsp;</p>



<p>A massive international study examining DNA from more than 28,000 COVID-19 patients and almost 600,000 people who hadn’t been infected (to the best of their knowledge) confirmed that inheritance from Neandertals is involved in COVID-19 susceptibility.</p>



<p>The study also confirmed a previous finding that <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coronavirus-covid-how-dna-genetic-risk-infection-severe-illness">people with type O blood may have some protection against getting infected</a> with the coronavirus (<em>SN: 7/8/21</em>). Exactly what accounts for the protection is still not known.</p>



<p>People with rare variants in a gene called toll-like receptor 7, or <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosgenetics/article?id=10.1371/journal.pgen.1010367" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>TLR7</em>, are 5.3 times more likely to get severe COVID-19</a> than those who don’t have the variants, the team also reported November 3 in <em>PLOS Genetics</em>. Biologically, the link makes sense. <em>TLR7</em>’s protein is involved in signaling the immune system that a virus has invaded. Part of its duties include <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/covid-19-coronavirus-immune-system-early-treatment-interferon">marshaling interferons</a>, immune system chemicals that are some of the first responders to viral infections (<em>SN: 8/6/20</em>). Interferons warn cells to raise their antiviral defenses and help to kill infected cells.&nbsp;</p>

<h4>
<a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/editors-picks/2019-novel-coronavirus-outbreak">See all our coverage of the coronavirus outbreak</a>
</h4>
</aside>



<p>A gene called <em>TYK2</em> is involved in producing some interferons. Genetic variants in that gene raise the risk of developing lupus, but may<a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosgenetics/article?id=10.1371/journal.pgen.1010253" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> protect against coronavirus infection</a>, researchers report in a separate study also published November 3 in <em>PLOS Genetics</em>. While riling up interferons may fend off the coronavirus, when there is no virus to combat, the immune system may damage the body with friendly fire, producing lupus or other autoimmune diseases. Such <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/black-death-immunity-gene-crohns-disease-health">genetic trade-offs</a> are common (<em>SN: 10/19/22</em>).&nbsp;</p>



<p>Evidence links many other genes to COVID-19 outcomes, multiple large studies have found. Some of those findings may hint at drugs that could better treat the disease.</p>



<h4>Individual risk</h4>



<p>But the problem with all of these studies is that they can’t tell any individual what their chances are of a bad outcome from catching COVID-19. For instance, the DNA testing company 23andMe tells me that <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/consumer-genetic-testing-dna-genome">I have less than 2 percent Neandertal DNA</a> (<em>SN: 5/22/18</em>). I don’t know whether that includes the variants that would make me more susceptible to severe disease or the ones that protect against infection. What if I got both? And how does that play with my blood type and all the other genetic variants I may carry?&nbsp;</p>



<p>Then you have to factor in your age, your health, your environment. Let’s face it, that last one is probably the most important. For instance, if you have a job that exposes you to multiple people, you’re at higher risk of getting COVID-19 than someone who works from home.&nbsp;</p>



<p>There’s nothing you can do about the genetic hand you’re dealt (at least not until gene editing is perfected). Many experts I talk to say that improving indoor air in public buildings is what is really needed to avoid infection. That’s also out of most people’s hands. But there are still things you can do to lessen your risk. Labaki’s advice to cancer patients — mask, avoid crowds, wash your hands — plus staying up-to-date on vaccinations is good for everyone.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Stonehenge: A calendar or just a crematorium </strong>— <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/stonehenge-calendar-or-just-crematorium"><em>Science News</em></a>, November 11, 1972</p>



<p>The monument consisted of a circle of immense, finely tooled stone archways surrounded by a range of 56 equally spaced [holes].… The precisely proportioned placement of the stones and holes has led archaeologists to presume that the monument had some great astrological significance.… As an alternate explanation, the researchers say perhaps there were 56 families, clans or social units who built Stonehenge and who were entitled to dig one of the [holes] and use it to inter cremated remains.</p>





<h4>Update</h4>



<p>Stonehenge’s purpose remains murky, but the monument’s origin is becoming clearer thanks to science. For at least the first 500 years of its existence, Stonehenge <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/domain-dead">was a cemetery</a> (<em>SN: 5/29/08</em>). A chemical analysis of remains at the site suggests that some of the people interred there <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/cremated-remains-reveal-hints-who-buried-stonehenge">came from Wales</a>, more than 200 kilometers west of where Stonehenge stands in southern England (<em>SN: 8/2/18</em>). The monument&#8217;s first building blocks also may have come from Wales, repurposed from <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/stonehenge-roots-wales-stone-circle-archaeology">a stone circle</a> there, but that hypothesis is debated (<em>SN: 2/11/21</em>).</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/shark-ocean-fish-population-recovery-extinction">Sharks face rising odds of extinction even as other big fish populations recover</a></h4>

              
                <p>After decades of population declines, the future is looking brighter for several tuna and billfish species, such as southern bluefin tuna, black marlins and swordfish, thanks to years of successful fisheries management and conservation actions. But some sharks that live in these fishes’ open water habitats are still in trouble, new research suggests.</p>



<p>These sharks, including oceanic whitetips and porbeagles, are often caught by accident within tuna and billfish fisheries. And a lack of dedicated management of these species has meant <a href="http://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.add0342" target="_blank" rel="noopener">their chances of extinction continue to rise</a>, researchers report in the Nov. 11 <em>Science</em>.&nbsp;</p>





<p>The analysis evaluates the extinction risk of 18 species of large ocean fish over nearly seven decades. It provides “a view of the open ocean that we have not had before,” says Colin Simpfendorfer, a marine biologist at James Cook University in Australia who was not involved in this research.</p>



<p>“Most of this information was available for individual species, but the synthesis for all of the species provides a much broader picture of what is happening in this important ecosystem,” he says.</p>



<p>In recent years, major global biodiversity assessments have documented declines in species and ecosystems across the globe, says Maria José Juan-Jordá, a fisheries ecologist at the Spanish Institute of Oceanography in Madrid. But these patterns are poorly understood in the oceans.</p>



<p>To fill this gap, Juan-Jordá and her colleagues looked to the <a href="https://www.iucnredlist.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">International Union for Conservation of Nature’s Red List</a>, which evaluates changes in a species’s extinction risk. The Red List Index evaluates the risk of extinction of an entire group of species. The team specifically targeted tunas, billfishes and sharks — large predatory fishes that have influential roles in their open ocean ecosystems.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Red List Index assessments occur every four to 10 years. In the new study, the researchers built on the Red List criteria to develop a way of tracking extinction risk continuously over time, rather than just within the IUCN intervals.</p>



<p>Juan-Jordá and her colleagues did this by compiling data on species’ average age at reproductive maturity, changes in population biomass and abundance from fish stock assessments for seven tuna species, like the vulnerable bigeye and endangered southern bluefin; six billfish species, like black marlin and sailfish; and five shark species. The team combined the data to calculate extinction risk trends for these 18 species from 1950 to 2019.</p>



<p>The team found that the extinction risk for tunas and billfishes increased throughout the last half of the 20th century, with the trend reversing for tunas starting in the 1990s and billfishes in the 2010s. These shifts are tied to known reductions in fishing deaths for these species that occurred at the same time.</p>





<p>The results are positive for tunas and billfishes, Simpfendorfer says. But three of the seven tunas and three of the six billfishes that the researchers looked at are still considered near threatened, vulnerable or endangered. “Now is not the time for complacency in managing these species,” Simpfendorfer says.</p>



<p>But shark species are floundering in these very same waters where tuna and billfish are fished, where the sharks are often caught as bycatch.&nbsp;</p>

<p>“While we are increasingly sustainably managing the commercially important, valuable target species of tunas and billfishes,” says Juan-Jordá, “shark populations continue to decline, therefore, the risk of extinction has continued to increase.”</p>



<p>Some solutions going forward, says Juan-Jordá, include catch limits for some species and establishing sustainability goals within tuna and billfish fisheries beyond just the targeted species, addressing the issue of sharks that are incidentally caught. And it’s important to see if measures taken to reduce shark bycatch deaths are actually effective, she says.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“There is a clear need for significant improvement in shark-focused management, and organizations responsible for their management need to act quickly before it is too late,” Simpfendorfer says. </p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/metal-sound-flexible-electronics">Zapping tiny metal drops with sound creates wires for soft electronics</a></h4>

              
                <p>Zapping liquid metal droplets with ultrasound offers a new way to make wiring for stretchy, bendy electronics.</p>



<p>The <a href="http://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.ade1813" target="_blank" rel="noopener">technique</a>, described in the Nov. 11 <em>Science</em>, adds a new approach to the toolbox for researchers developing circuitry for medical sensors that attach to the skin, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/future-smart-clothes-could-pack-serious-gadgetry">wearable electronics</a> and other applications where rigid circuit electronics are less than ideal (<em>SN: 6/1/18</em>).</p>



<p>The researchers began by drawing on sheets of stretchy plastic with lines of microscopic droplets made of an alloy of gallium and indium. The metal alloy is liquid at temperatures above about 16° Celsius.</p>





<p>Though the liquid metal is electrically conductive, the droplets quickly oxidize. That process covers each of them with a thin insulating layer. The layers carry static charges that push the drops apart, making them useless for connecting the LEDs, microchips and other components in electronic circuitry.</p>



<p>By hitting the microspheres with high-frequency sound waves, the researchers caused the microscopic balls to shed even smaller, nanoscopic balls of liquid metal. The tiny spheres bridge the gaps between the larger ones, and that close contact allows electrons to tunnel through the oxide layers so that the droplets can carry electricity.</p>



<p>When the plastic that the drops are printed on is stretched or bent, the larger balls of metal can deform, while the smaller ones act like rigid particles that shift around to maintain contact.</p>



<p>The researchers demonstrated their conductors by connecting electronics into a stretchy pattern of LEDs displaying the initials of the Dynamic Materials Design Laboratory, where the work was done. The team also built a sensor with the conductors that can <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/wearable-sensor-patch-stroke-patients">monitor blood through a person’s skin</a> (<em>SN: 2/17/18</em>).</p>



<p>Flexible electronics applications aren’t new, says materials scientist Jiheong Kang of the Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology in Daejeon, South Korea. But there are advantages of the new approach over other designs, he says, such as those that rely on channels filled with liquid metal that can leak if the circuitry is damaged. Liquid metal in the conductors that Kang and colleagues developed stays trapped in the tiny spheres that are embedded in the plastic and remains in place even if the material is torn.</p>



<p>Wires made of liquid metal have often been the go-to conductors for stretchy electronics, says Carmel Majidi, a researcher in mechanical engineering at Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh who was not involved with the new study. Using ultrasound introduces a “novel approach to achieving that conductivity.” Other groups have managed that feat by heating circuits, exposing them to lasers, squishing them or vibrating the circuits to get droplets to connect to each other, he says.</p>





<p>Majidi isn’t convinced that the ultrasound approach is a game changer for flexible circuits. But he says that it’s high time the subject is appearing in a leading journal like <em>Science</em>. “I’m personally really excited to see the field overall, and this particular type of material architecture, is now gaining this visibility.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/child-treated-rare-genetic-disease-womb">This child was treated for a rare genetic disease while still in the womb</a></h4>

              
                <p>A toddler girl is flourishing after receiving treatment for a rare genetic disease. In a first for this disease, she received that treatment before she was even born.</p>



<p>Sixteen-month-old Ayla has infantile-onset Pompe disease — a genetic disorder that can cause organ damage that begins before birth. Babies born with Pompe have enlarged hearts and weak muscles. If left untreated, most infants die before they turn 2. Treatment typically begins after birth, but that tactic doesn’t prevent the irreversible, and potentially deadly, organ damage that happens in utero.</p>





<p>Ayla received treatment while still in the womb as part of an early-stage clinical trial. Today, the toddler has a normal heart and is meeting developmental milestones, including walking. Her success is a sign that <a href="http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2200587" target="_blank" rel="noopener">prenatal treatment of the disease can stave off organ damage</a> and improve babies’ lives, researchers report November 9 in the <em>New England Journal of Medicine</em>.</p>



<p>“It’s a great step forward,” says Bill Peranteau, a pediatric and fetal surgeon at the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia who wasn’t involved in the work.</p>



<p>Infantile-onset Pompe disease is a rare condition that affects fewer than 1 out of 138,000 babies born globally. It’s caused by genetic changes that either reduce levels of an enzyme called acid alpha-glucosidase, or GAA, or prevent the body from making it at all.</p>



<p>Inside cellular structures called lysosomes, GAA turns the complex sugar glycogen into glucose, the body’s main source of energy. Without GAA, glycogen accumulates to dangerously high levels that can damage muscle tissue, including the heart and muscles that help people breathe.</p>



<p>While some people can develop Pompe disease later in life or have a less severe version that doesn’t enlarge the heart, Ayla was diagnosed with the most severe form. Her body doesn’t make any GAA. Replacing the <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/milked-enzyme-thwarts-muscle-disorder">missing enzyme</a> through an infusion can help curb glycogen buildup, especially if treatment starts soon after birth (<em>SN: 4/26/04</em>).</p>



<p>Early studies in mice suggested that <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/scitranslmed.aay8980" target="_blank" rel="noopener">treatment before birth</a> showed promise at controlling a Pompe-like disease. So pediatric geneticist Jennifer L. Cohen of Duke University School of Medicine and colleagues launched an <a href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04532047" target="_blank" rel="noopener">early-stage clinical trial</a> covering Pompe and seven similar conditions, broadly called lysosomal storage diseases.</p>



<p>The team began treating Ayla by infusing GAA through the umbilical vein when her mother was 24 weeks pregnant. Her mother received a total of six infusions, one every two weeks. After birth, the medical team has been treating Ayla with now-weekly infusions, and she will continue to need treatment throughout her life.</p>





<p>The therapy was safe for both mother and child, Cohen says. But until more patients are treated and monitored in the trial, it’s unclear whether this prenatal enzyme replacement is always a safe and effective option. So far, two other patients with other lysosomal storage diseases have received treatment in the trial, but it’s too early to know how they’re faring.</p>



<p>Researchers are also exploring in utero therapies for other rare genetic diseases, including the <a href="https://fetus.ucsf.edu/intrauterine-therapy-alpha-thalassemia-major/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">blood disorder alpha thalassemia</a>. And in 2018, researchers described three children who were <a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa1714322" target="_blank" rel="noopener">successfully treated for a sweating disorder</a> before they were born.</p>



<p>Such approaches have the potential to treat other rare diseases in the future, Peranteau says. But it will be important to first show that any newly developed treatments are safe and work when given after birth before trying them in utero.</p>



<p>For now, it’s unclear how Ayla and other treated patients will fare over the long term, Cohen says. “We’re cautiously optimistic, but we want to be careful and be monitoring throughout the patient’s life. Especially those first five years, I think, are going to be critical to see how she does.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/greenland-hinterlands-leaking-ice">Greenland’s frozen hinterlands are bleeding worse than we thought</a></h4>

              
                <p>Sea level rise may proceed faster than expected in the coming decades, as a gargantuan flow of ice slithering out of Greenland’s remote interior both picks up speed and shrinks.</p>



<p>By the end of the century, the ice stream’s deterioration could contribute to <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-022-05301-z" target="_blank" rel="noopener">nearly 16 millimeters of global sea level rise</a> — more than six times the amount scientists had previously estimated, researchers report November 9 in <em>Nature</em>.</p>



<p>The finding suggests that inland portions of large ice flows elsewhere could also be withering and accelerating due to human-caused <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/century/climate-change-carbon-dioxide-greenhouse-gas-emissions-global-warming">climate change</a>, and that past research has probably underestimated the rates at which the ice will contribute to sea level rise (<em>SN: 3/10/22</em>).</p>





<p>“It&#8217;s not something that we expected,” says Shfaqat Abbas Khan, a glaciologist at the Technical University of Denmark in Kongens Lyngby. “Greenland and Antarctica’s contributions to sea level rise in the next 80 years will be significantly larger than we have predicted until now.”</p>



<p>In the new study, Khan and colleagues focused on the Northeast Greenland Ice Stream, a titanic conveyor belt of solid ice that crawls about 600 kilometers out of the landmass’s hinterland and into the sea. It drains about 12 percent of the country’s entire ice sheet and contains enough water to raise global sea level more than a meter. Near the coast, the ice stream splits into two glaciers, Nioghalvfjerdsfjord and Zachariae Isstrøm.</p>



<p>While frozen, these glaciers keep the ice behind them <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/climate-marine-ice-cliffs-sheets-collapse-not-inevitable-sea-level">from rushing into the sea</a>, much like dams hold back water in a river (<em>SN: 6/17/21</em>). When the ice shelf of Zachariae Isstrøm collapsed about a decade ago, scientists found that the flow of ice behind the glacier <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.aac7111" target="_blank" rel="noopener">started accelerating</a>. But whether those changes penetrated deep into Greenland’s interior remained largely unresolved.</p>



<p>“We’ve mostly concerned ourselves with the margins,” says atmosphere-cryosphere scientist Jenny Turton of the nonprofit Arctic Frontiers in Tromsø, Norway, who was not involved in the new study. That’s where <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/greenland-antarctica-are-gaining-ice-inland-losing-melting-overall">the most dramatic changes</a> with the <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/glacier-melt-causes-large-fraction-sea-level-rise">greatest impacts on sea level rise</a> have been observed, she says (<em>SN: 4/30/22, SN: 5/16/13</em>).</p>



<p>Keen to measure small rates of movement in the ice stream far inland, Khan and his colleagues used GPS, which in the past has exposed the tortuous creeping of <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/century/earth-history-plate-tectonics-volcanoes-earthquakes">tectonic plates</a> (<em>SN: 1/13/21</em>). The team analyzed GPS data from three stations along the ice stream’s main trunk, all located between 90 and 190 kilometers inland.</p>



<p>The data showed that the ice stream had accelerated at all three points from 2016 to 2019. In that time frame, the ice speed at the station farthest inland increased from about 344 meters per year to surpassing 351 meters per year.</p>





<p>The researchers then compared the GPS measurements with data collected by polar-orbiting satellites and aircraft surveys. The aerial data agreed with the GPS analysis, revealing that the ice stream was accelerating as far as 200 kilometers upstream. What’s more, shrinking — or thinning — of the ice stream that started in 2011 at Zachariae Isstrøm had propagated more than 250 kilometers upstream by 2021.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“This is showing that glaciers are responding along their length faster than we had thought previously,” says Leigh Stearns, a glaciologist from the University of Kansas in Lawrence, who was not involved in the study.</p>



<p>Khan and his colleagues then used the data to tune computer simulations that forecast the ice stream’s impact on sea level rise. The researchers predict that by 2100, the ice stream will have singlehandedly contributed between about 14 to 16 millimeters of global sea level rise — as much as Greenland&#8217;s entire ice sheet has in the last 50 years.</p>



<p>The findings suggest that past research has probably underestimated rates of sea level rise due to the ice stream, Stearns and Turton say. Similarly, upstream thinning and acceleration in other large ice flows, such as those associated with Antarctica’s shrinking <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/antarctic-glaciers-antarctica-pine-island-melting-climate-change-global-warming">Pine Island</a> and <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/antarctica-thwaites-glacier-ice-shelf-collapse-climate-5-years">Thwaites glaciers</a>, might also cause sea levels to rise faster than expected, Turton says (<em>SN: 6/9/22, SN: 12/13/21</em>).</p>



<p>Khan and his colleagues plan to investigate inland sections of other large ice flows in Greenland and Antarctica, with the hopes of <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/why-climate-change-models-disagree-earth-worst-case-scenarios">improving forecasts of sea level rise</a> (<em>SN: 1/7/20</em>).</p>



<p>Such forecasts are crucial for adapting to climate change, Stearns says. “They&#8217;re helping us better understand the processes so that we can inform the people who need to know that information.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/harlequin-frogs-lazarus-species-extinction-comeback">Some harlequin frogs — presumed extinct — have been rediscovered</a></h4>

              
                <p>Across Central and South America, one group of bejeweled frogs is making a comeback.</p>



<p>Harlequin frogs — a genus with over 100 brightly colored species — were one of the groups of amphibians hit hardest by a skin-eating <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/frog-killing-bd-chytrid-fungus-death-toll">chytrid</a> fungus that rapidly spread around the globe in the 1980s (<em>SN: 3/28/19</em>). The group is so susceptible to the disease that with the added pressures of climate change and habitat loss, around 70 percent of known harlequin frog species are now listed as extinct or critically engendered.</p>





<p>But in recent years, roughly one-third of <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0006320722003378" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">harlequin frogs presumed to have gone extinct</a> since the 1950s have been rediscovered, researchers report in the December <em>Biological Conservation</em>.</p>



<p>The news is a rare “glimmer of hope” in an otherwise bleak time for amphibians around the globe, says Kyle Jaynes, a conservation biologist at Michigan State University in Hickory Corners.</p>



<h4>The comeback frog</h4>



<p>For Jaynes, the path to uncovering how many harlequin frogs have returned from the brink of extinction started when he heard about the Jambato harlequin frog (<em>Atelopus ignescens</em>). This black and orange frog was once so widespread in the Ecuadorian Andes that its common name comes from the word ”<a href="https://alianzajambato.org/en/jambato-alliance/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">jampatu</a>,” which means “frog” in Kichwa, the Indigenous language of the area.</p>



<p>Then came the fungus. From 1988 to 1989, the frogs “just completely disappeared,” Jaynes says. For years, people searched for traces of the frogs. Scientists ran extensive surveys, and pastors offered rewards to their congregants for anyone that could find one.</p>



<p>Then in 2016, a boy discovered a small population of Jambato frogs in a mountain valley in Ecuador. For a species that had been missing for decades, “it seemed like a miracle,” says Luis Coloma, a researcher and conservationist at the Centro Jambatu de Investigación y Conservación de Anfibios in Quito, Ecuador.</p>



<p>Coloma runs a breeding program for Jambato and other Ecuadorian frogs threatened with extinction. In 2019, Jaynes was part of a group of researchers visiting Coloma’s lab to see if they could work out how these frogs had cheated death. After the Jambato frogs returned to the scene, the team started hearing about other missing harlequin species being spotted for the first time in years.</p>





<p>Those stories led Jaynes, Coloma and their colleagues to comb through reports to see just how many harlequin frogs had reappeared. Of the more than 80 species to have gone missing since 1950, as many as 32 species were spotted in the last two decades — a much higher number than the team had expected.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>“I think we were all shocked,” Jaynes says.</p>



<h4>Ensuring conservation</h4>



<p>The news comes with caveats. For one thing, it seems like most species avoided disappearing by a hair, and their numbers are still dangerously low. So extinction is still very much on the table. “We’ve got a second chance here,” Jaynes says. “But there is still a lot we have to do to conserve these species.”</p>



<p>Ensuring the continuation of the rediscovered species will depend in part on understanding how they’ve managed to survive so far. Some scientists have speculated that amphibians at higher elevations might be more susceptible to the fungus since it prefers lower temperatures.</p>

<p>But a cursory analysis by Jaynes and colleagues revealed that harlequin frogs are being rediscovered at all elevations across their range, indicating that something else may be at play. Jaynes suspects that there is <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/some-frogs-may-be-bouncing-back-after-killer-chytrid-fungus">a biological basis</a> for which harlequin frogs live, such as having developed resistance to the fungus (<em>SN: 3/29/18</em>).</p>



<p>Studies like this one can serve as a “launching pad” for understanding how amphibians might survive the dual threats of disease and climate change, says Valerie McKenzie, a disease ecologist at the University of Colorado Boulder who was not involved with the study.</p>



<p>In the meantime, the fact that people are starting to notice the reemergence of species that were once thought to be gone forever “gives me a lot of hope that other species that are harder to observe — because they’re nocturnal or live high in the canopy — are also recovering,” she says. “It motivates me to think we should go look for them.”</p>

                <p>This week on Journal Club session Mahsa Aliakbarzadeh will talk about a paper &quot;On Robot Compliance: A Cerebellar Control Approach&quot;.</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>The work presented here is a novel biological approach for the compliant
control of a robotic arm in real time (RT). We integrate a spiking cerebellar
network at the core of a feedback control loop performing torque-driven
control. The spiking cerebellar controller provides torque commands allowing
for accurate and coordinated arm movements. To compute these output motor
commands, the spiking cerebellar controller receives the robot's sensorial
signals, the robot's goal behavior, and an instructive signal. These input
signals are translated into a set of evolving spiking patterns representing
univocally a specific system state at every point of time. Spike-
timing-dependent plasticity (STDP) is then supported, allowing for building
adaptive control. The spiking cerebellar controller continuously adapts the
torque commands provided to the robot from experience as STDP is deployed.
Adaptive torque commands, in turn, help the spiking cerebellar controller to
cope with built-in elastic elements within the robot's actuators mimicking
human muscles (inherently elastic). We propose a natural integration of a
bioinspired control scheme, based on the cerebellum, with a compliant robot. We
prove that our compliant approach outperforms the accuracy of the default
factory-installed position control in a set of tasks used for addressing
cerebellar motor behavior: controlling six degrees of freedom (DoF) in smooth
movements, fast ballistic movements, and unstructured scenario compliant
movements.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/canaanite-comb-lice-israel-alphabet">This ancient Canaanite comb is engraved with a plea against lice</a></h4>

              
                <p>Engraved into the side of a nearly 4,000-year-old ivory comb is a simple wish: Get these lice out of my hair.</p>



<p>This faint inscription, written in the early language of the ancient Canaanites, represents the earliest known instance of a complete sentence written using a phonetic alphabet, says archaeologist Yosef Garfinkel of the Hebrew University of Jerusalem.</p>



<p>The writing system of the <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/ancient-dna-offers-clues-canaanites-fate">Canaanites</a>, who lived in a region in the eastern Mediterranean called the Levant until around 2,000 years ago, later served as a major basis for many modern alphabets (<em>SN: 7/27/17</em>). That makes the comb “the most important object I’ve ever found during an excavation,” says Garfinkel. The research was published November 9 in the <em>Jerusalem Journal of Archaeology</em>.</p>





<p>The Canaanites were a cultural group that traded widely across the Mediterranean. Few of their written records have survived, so most of what researchers know about them come from other documents, such as the Old Testament.</p>



<p>The comb was the unearthed in 2016 among the ruins of the ancient city of Lachish in present-day Israel. Years later, when the comb was sent to a lab to search for traces of lice, someone noticed faint symbols etched on the side. A closer look revealed that <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.52486/01.00002.4" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the symbols</a> spelled out the sentence, “May this tusk root out the lice of the hair and the beard,” Garfinkel and colleagues report November 9 in the <em>Jerusalem Journal of Archaeology</em>.</p>



<p>The discovery may offer a glimpse into the life of one of Lachish’s wealthy denizens. The fact that the sentence refers to a beard suggests it belonged to an elite man, Garfinkel says, since elephant ivory was an expensive good that had to be imported from Egypt.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The plea against lice is “so human,” says Garfinkel, who notes that other writings from the time tend to center around royal accomplishments or religion. It also appears that the comb was able to fulfill its purpose, at least somewhat. Between the teeth, the researchers found the ancient remains of a louse.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/mysterious-antibiotics-kill-bacteria-drug-resistant-polymyxins">Here’s how mysterious last-resort antibiotics kill bacteria</a></h4>

              
                <p>To kill drug-resistant bacteria, &#8220;last-resort&#8221; antibiotics borrow a tactic from Medusa’s playbook: petrification.</p>



<p>New high-resolution microscope images show that a class of antibiotics called polymyxins crystallize the cell membranes of bacteria. The honeycomb-shaped crystals that form turn the microbes’ usually supple skins of fat molecules into <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-022-33838-0" target="_blank" rel="noopener">thin brittle sheets</a>, researchers report October 21 in <em>Nature Communications</em>. When the petrified membranes break, the bacteria die.</p>



<p>The finding was a total surprise, says Sebastian Hiller, a structural biologist at the University of Basel in Switzerland.</p>





<p>Hiller, biophysicist Selen Manioğlu and their colleagues had been using the antibiotics as a control for a different experiment. When the researchers turned on their microscopes, &#8220;we saw these waffles,&#8221; Hiller says. &#8220;I immediately recognized, wow, this must be something special.”</p>



<p>Polymyxin antibiotics like colistin were discovered in the 1940s and are now used as a powerful last-ditch defense against bacteria that have evolved resistance to most other drugs. Researchers already knew that polymyxins somehow interfere with bacterial cell membranes. But nobody had imagined a scenario like the &#8220;waffles&#8221; the team discovered.</p>

Manioğlu</span></figcaption></figure></div>


<p>In the new study, Hiller and colleagues exposed bits of cell membrane from <em>Escherichia</em> <em>coli</em> to varying concentrations of colistin. Imaging with atomic force microscopy revealed that crystals formed at the minimum concentrations required to kill the bacteria. Colistin-resistant strains exposed to the drug didn’t form crystals.</p>



<p>The results indicate that polymyxins work by arranging the cell membrane into a crystalline structure that leaves it brittle and vulnerable. &#8220;That&#8217;s something that has not even remotely been hypothesized so far,&#8221; says Markus Weingarth, a biochemist at Utrecht University in the Netherlands who was not involved in the work. &#8220;It&#8217;s a very important study. I&#8217;d even say it&#8217;s a breakthrough.”</p>



<p>How exactly polymyxins crystallize cell membranes remains unclear. That’s a problem because <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/bacteria-resistant-last-resort-antibiotic-appears-us">some bacteria have developed resistance to polymyxins</a> and are becoming <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/antibiotic-resistant-bacteria-strike-drug-last-resort">more widespread</a> (<em>SN: 5/27/16</em>; <em>SN: 10/30/90</em>)<em>.</em> Without more studies like this one to help reveal how the drugs work, scientists can’t effectively modify the antibiotics to make them more effective, Weingarth says.</p>





<p>Hiller hopes that this first glimpse of polymyxins’ petrifying powers will help scientists combat resistance to the antibiotics. </p>



<p>&#8220;Understanding these concepts will definitely bring a lot of ideas — and the potential to make new drugs,” Hiller says.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/fruit-flies-eyes-head-eyestalks">Certain young fruit flies’ eyes literally pop out of their head</a></h4>

              
                <p>Body changes at the brink of adulthood can get awkward in humans, but at least our eyes don’t pop out of our heads on stalks longer than our legs.</p>



<p>High-rise eyes, however, give macho pizzazz to the adult male <em>Pelmatops </em>fruit fly. In one of the stalkier species, <em>P. tangliangi</em>, the eyes-up transformation takes only about 50 minutes, a new study reports. Once stretched, the skinny eyestalks darken and harden, keeping the eyes stuck out like selfie sticks for the rest of the fly’s life.</p>

Just 16 minutes after emerging from the little capsule where he changed from a fat wormy larva into a sleek adult, the eyes are still close to his head (A). Over the following 34 minutes (B–H), the gangly eyestalks grow and eventually darken, stretching the eyes away from the body. The following day, the fully periscoped adult is ready to explore.</span><span class="credit wp-credit-3118764">N. Huangfu <em>et al</em>/<em>Annals of the Entomological Society of America</em> 2022</span></figcaption></figure></div>


<p>The details of <em>P. tangliangi</em>’s eye lift come from <a href="https://academic.oup.com/aesa/article/115/5/365/6628560" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the first published photo sequence of their ocular blossoming</a>, which appears in the September <em>Annals of the Entomological Society of America.</em> Biologists have known that eyestalks evolved in eight different fly families. Yet <em>Pelmatops</em> flies have gotten so little scientific attention that a lot of their basic biology has been a string of question marks.</p>



<p>Video images show the eyestalks curl and rise irregularly. Yet “they are not flopping around while partly inflated,” says Xiaolin Chen, an entomologist and evolutionary biologist at the Chinese Academy of Sciences in Beijing. “They seem slightly stiff, but still flexible enough.”</p>





<p>Females of the species may raise shorter eyestalks too — if Chen and her colleagues have found the right females. Chen suspects that what are now named as two species, based on the few specimens available, may just be two sexes of the same species. The new paper describes a male <em>P. tangliangi</em> mating with a female known by a different species name<em>. </em>Her stalks aren’t as magnificent as his, but she has some.</p>



<p>While the headgear can burden a flying insect, long eyestalks may give flies some swagger. These <em>Pelmatops</em> and other kinds of stalk-eyed flies face off, eyestalk to eyestalk, with uppity intruders. There’s no knocking and locking stalks in fierce fly disputes though. Any pushing and shoving, Chen says, is “done with other body parts.”</p>



<p>Extreme eyes may also have other benefits. In the wild, Chen finds these fruit flies on long stems of <em>Rubus</em> berry brambles. The eyes naturally periscope outward and upward, allowing the flies to spot danger while the body stays hidden in the greenery.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/video-springtails-jumps-collembola">Video reveals that springtails are tiny acrobats</a></h4>

              
                <p>It’s not just panic and chance. Some of nature’s extreme self-launchers, the springtails, turn out to be much more acrobatic than scientists thought.</p>



<p>Springtails, poppy seed–sized cousins of insects, “are famous because they know how to jump but also famous because they have no control at all according to the literature,” says biomechanist Victor M. Ortega-Jiménez of the University of Maine in Orono.</p>



<p>But in a study published November 7 in <em>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences</em>, he and colleagues have used high-speed video to <a href="https://www.pnas.org/cgi/doi/10.1073/pnas.2211283119" target="_blank" rel="noopener">challenge that received no-control “wisdom.”</a></p>





<p>Springtails tend to be ignored by most people because they are so hard to see with the naked eye. What’s more, the 3,000 plus known species do virtually no harm to people and thus don’t even get the attention we pay to ticks and fleas. Some <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/soil-bacteria-springtails-spore-growth">springtails</a> look like lemon drop candies with big spots of eyes and six legs; other species grow more stretched out (<em>SN: 4/24/20</em>).&nbsp;</p>



<p>The unusual organs used for jumping are one of the reasons springtails are no longer considered insects. Springtails (in the taxonomic group Collembola) evolved as insectlike animals with no wings but a long, hinged ground-smacker, called a furcula, latched underneath the springtail body.</p>



<p>Releasing it to whack downward against the ground, or even against water, launches a springtail high into the air and away from danger such as a hungry fish. Some springtail species have ground-smacked themselves to safety at speeds of 280 times their own body length per second. That’s the jump that biologists used to think would send a little body flipping upward with no control at all.</p>



<p>Questioning that notion starts with pandemic musing, Ortega-Jiménez remembers. He was at Georgia Tech in Atlanta, but with labs closed and “a lot of time with my family on rivers in Georgia,” he says. That’s how he saw springtails launching themselves out of the water but usually landing on land — and the jumps just didn’t look random to him.</p>



<p>Once labs reopened, he and a wide collaboration of colleagues attacked the problem of exactly what happens during springtails’ emergency launches. Focusing on the semiaquatic species <em>Isotomurus retardatus</em>, films at such extreme speeds as 10,000 frames per second showed plenty of control.</p>



<p>Springtails are not in fact just squiggles hurtling helplessly through the air. They curl their bodies while in flight in such a way that they stop tumbling and fall oriented for landing, both video and mathematical models showed. This orienting while falling is something cats and some other animals do well, but Ortega-Jiménez notes that springtails do it faster than any other animal tested, at less than about 20 milliseconds.</p>

</div><figcaption>Long thought to launch themselves randomly into the air when danger threatens, tiny springtails (<em>Isotomurus retardatus)</em> turn out to have some control over their leaping direction. They also curve their body to stop tumbling in air and use a tubelike structure on their underside to help land upright some 85 percent of the time. (High-speed video has been slowed for viewing.)</figcaption></figure>



<p>That landing uses another distinctive springtail body part, a short wide tubelike organ called a collophore that sticks down out of the abdomen. The animal in profile looks like some plastic toy just out of a mold with the collophore hanging from its tummy like a tab not snapped off yet.</p>





<p>A bit of water in the tubular collophore gives it some weight that helps keep the jumper from bouncing into somersaults as it splashes down on the water surface.</p>



<p>Springtails in lab pools landed on their feet about 85 percent of the time, the team found. Mimicking the landings with a springtail-inspired robot not much bigger than a penny achieved 75 percent landing success.</p>



<p>All this attention to springtail jumping prowess cheers Anton Potapov, a soil animal ecologist at the University of Göttingen in Germany, who was not involved in the study. Springtails “are not only&nbsp;cute and interesting to look at; they are&nbsp;also among&nbsp;the most&nbsp;numerous and functionally important&nbsp;animals on our planet,” he says.</p>



<p>“You can find them virtually everywhere, and&nbsp;they contribute to so many ecosystem processes,” such as plant and microbial growth. Long — and high — may they jump.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/solar-storm-radiation-trees-miyake-event">Catastrophic solar storms may not explain shadows of radiation in trees</a></h4>

              
                <p>A cryptic chemical signature of unknown origins, hidden for centuries inside the trunks of Earth’s trees, just became even more mysterious.</p>



<p>In the last decade, scientists have discovered traces on Earth of six intense bursts of radiation, known as Miyake events, scattered over the last 9,300 years. The most popular explanation is that these mysterious signatures were left behind by massive solar storms, leading some scientists to warn that the next Miyake event could cripple the world’s electrical grid. But new research, published in the October <em>Proceedings of the Royal Society A</em>, suggests that <a href="https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rspa.2022.0497" target="_blank" rel="noopener">more than just solar flares</a> might be behind the enigmatic radiation.</p>





<p>The finding underscores the need for further investigations into these strange bursts, which could potentially harm our society in the future, says physicist Gianluca Quarta of the University of Salento in Lecce, Italy, who was not involved in the study. “Something is not fitting with what we know at the moment.”</p>



<p>Miyake events were first discovered in trees. As trees grow, their trunks accrue layers, or rings, which lock in chemical signatures from their surroundings. By analyzing the composition of individual tree rings, researchers can <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/tree-story-book-explores-what-tree-rings-can-tell-us-about-past">uncover clues about environmental conditions</a> going back thousands of years (<em>SN: 6/1/20</em>).</p>



<p>In 2012, physicist Fusa Miyake of Nagoya University in Japan was studying Japanese cedar tree rings when she found <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nature11123" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a sharp spike in radiocarbon</a> — a variant of carbon that can form when cosmic radiation strikes Earth’s atmosphere — in rings dating to about A.D. 774. Since then, <a href="https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/2021GL093419" target="_blank" rel="noopener">five other similar bursts</a>, now named Miyake events, have been detected in tree rings around the world as well as in <a href="https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/2014GL062218" target="_blank" rel="noopener">polar ice cores</a>.</p>



<p>Due to the spikes’ global occurrence, many scientists contend that the events have an extraterrestrial origin. The most popular explanation is that especially large <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/sun-solar-storms-earth-havoc-space-weather-forecasts">solar storms</a>, or flares, blasted Earth with big bursts of radiation (<em>SN: 2/26/21</em>).</p>



<p>The most powerful solar storm in recorded history was the <a href="https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=njp.32101081655332&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=357" target="_blank" rel="noopener">1859 Carrington event</a>, which broke telegraph lines and sparked a circuit fire in Pittsburgh. The radiation levels associated with Miyake events are more than 80 times those of the Carrington event, says physicist Benjamin Pope of the University of Queensland in St. Lucia, Australia. “They could pose serious risks to global technology.”</p>



<p>But the solar storm story has holes. Radiation levels from the 774 event <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/asna.201412071" target="_blank" rel="noopener">would have been too high</a> to have come from a single solar flare, some researchers have suggested. And ice cores, which can also store chemical traces of solar flares, have not yet yielded evidence of increased solar activity <a href="https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/2014GL062218" target="_blank" rel="noopener">for every Miyake event</a>.</p>



<p>So, Pope and his colleagues put the leading hypothesis to the test. They analyzed all publicly available tree ring data on the six Miyake events using computer simulations of Earth’s carbon cycle. This allowed the team to calculate the duration, timing and amplitude of each event.</p>





<p>If Miyake events are tied to solar activity, they could align with the solar maxima, which occur roughly every 11 years when solar flares become more frequent. But the researchers found no correlation between Miyake events and any phase of the solar cycle. What’s more, the researchers found that two of the events appeared to last longer than a year — unexpectedly long for solar storms, which typically rage for hours or days.</p>



<p>And if solar flares did cause the events, then trees nearer the poles, where Earth’s protective magnetic field is weaker, should contain higher levels of Miyake event radiation. But the researchers found no such trend.</p>



<p>The findings don’t rule out the solar flare hypothesis, Pope says. Insufficient tree ring data could be hiding a link between solar activity and Miyake events, he says. New Antarctic ice-core data — being analyzed by researchers at the Australian Nuclear Science and Technology Organization and hopefully published next year — may provide more answers.</p>



<p>Solar flares could still be behind the events, Quarta agrees. Nuances in Earth’s carbon cycle not captured by the simulations could influence the findings. For instance, trees might metabolize radiocarbon at different rates depending on species or latitude, he says.</p>



<p>Though the mystery remains unsolved, Pope isn’t losing sleep over another Miyake event happening anytime soon. There’s about a 1 percent chance of one happening in the next decade, he says. “I’d be more worried about being hit by a bus on my walk to the office.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/lost-ancient-star-catalog-found">Part of a lost, ancient star catalog has now been found</a></h4>

              
                <p>Fragments of a star catalog from the second century B.C. have turned up in a manuscript that had been erased and written over centuries later. A new analysis of the religious manuscript shows that the hidden text is probably from the ancient Greek astronomer Hipparchus, whose map of the stars — thought to be the first attempt to map the entire sky — has long been considered lost.</p>



<p>“I think this lays to rest doubts about the existence of Hipparchus’ catalog” and confirms that he was “trying to measure coordinates for all of the visible stars,” says Victor Gysembergh, a historian of ancient science at CNRS in Paris. He and his colleagues reported <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/00218286221128289" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the discovery</a> in the November <em>Journal for the History of Astronomy</em>.</p>





<p>The manuscript that concealed the fragments was a palimpsest, or a parchment that had been erased and reused, called the <em>Codex Climaci Rescriptus</em>. The codex probably comes from the monastery of Saint Catherine of Sinai in Egypt, and most of it is currently housed at the Museum of the Bible in Washington, D.C.</p>



<p>The visible writing is a Christian text called the Ladder of Paradise. But shadows of earlier symbols were visible behind it. In 2017, researchers with the Early Manuscripts Electronics Library in Rolling Hills Estates, Calif., and the Rochester Institute of Technology in New York took digital pictures of the codex in many wavelengths of light, from many different angles. This technique is called multispectral imaging and is used to <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/prayer-archimedes">analyze palimpsests and other damaged books</a> (<em>SN: 10/3/07</em>). Light that reflected off the ancient ink, or that made the ink fluoresce, highlighted the hidden text. Once the pages are digitized, researchers all over the world can study them without leaving their computers.</p>

<p>Biblical scholar Peter Williams of the University of Cambridge was studying the digitized papers during one of the COVID-19 lockdowns. He and his team had previously found ancient poetry about astronomy beneath the main text. This time, he also found something that looked like astronomical measurements.</p>



<p>Williams reached out to Gysembergh and historian Emanuel Zingg of Sorbonne University in Paris for help. Gysembergh immediately thought of Hipparchus.</p>



<p>Hipparchus was a Greek astronomer and mathematician who lived between about 190 and 120 B.C. Indirect evidence suggests that he made the first star catalog that used two coordinates to uniquely define a position in the sky, rather than describing constellations’ positions relative to each other.</p>



<p>“I think most scholars believe there was such a catalog,” says Mathieu Ossendrijver, a historian of astronomy at Free University Berlin who was not involved in the new work. But the best evidence for it came from poor translations or references in later catalogs, like that of astronomer Claudius Ptolemy in Alexandria, Egypt, four centuries after Hipparchus.</p>





<p>To test the idea that the fragment was part of Hipparchus’ catalog, Gysembergh and colleagues first painstakingly translated the revealed passage. “A lot of it was, ‘Can you read this? I can’t,’” Gysembergh says. “We would struggle over every letter, every numeral.”</p>



<p>The passage turned out to be a description of the constellation Corona Borealis, the northern crown, giving numerical coordinates for several of its stars. The coordinates were written in an unusual notation that was thought to have been used by Hipparchus and no one else.</p>



<p>Next, the researchers used planetarium software to calculate where those stars would have been in the sky in 129 B.C., when Hipparchus was alive and working. Those calculations matched the ancient manuscript’s notations to within one degree.</p>



<p>“It’s quite clear that it is actually a well preserved, well copied, not much distorted part of the original catalog of Hipparchus,&#8221; Ossendrijver says. “It’s really an important discovery.”</p>



<p>Astronomers in ancient Babylonia may have had their own star catalog that was written even earlier, Ossendrijver says. “Could [Hipparchus] have picked up the idea of making a catalog maybe from Babylonians, and maybe even some concrete data?”</p>



<p>Gysembergh is hopeful that more of the Hipparchus catalog could turn up in other parts of the <em>Codex Climaci Rescriptus,</em> or in other texts that haven’t been analyzed with multispectral imaging yet. “There’s so much more to find in these manuscripts,” he says. “We’ve hardly scraped the surface.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/closest-known-black-hole-to-earth">Astronomers have found the closest known black hole to Earth</a></h4>

              
                <p>The closest black hole yet found is just 1,560 light-years from Earth, a new study reports. The black hole, dubbed Gaia BH1, is about 10 times the mass of the sun and orbits a sunlike star.</p>



<p>Most known black holes steal and eat gas from massive companion stars. That gas forms a disk around the black hole and glows brightly in X-rays. But hungry black holes are not the most common ones in our galaxy. Far more numerous are the tranquil black holes that are not mid-meal, which astronomers have dreamed of finding for decades. <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/black-hole-closest-earth-may-have-been-spotted">Previous claims</a> of finding such black holes <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/earth-nearest-black-hole-star-system-binary-space">have so far not held up</a> (<em>SN: 5/6/20; SN: 3/11/22</em>).</p>





<p>So astrophysicist Kareem El-Badry and colleagues turned to newly released data from the Gaia spacecraft, which precisely maps the positions of <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/new-asteroid-gaia-map-milky-way-galaxy-stars">billions of stars</a> (<em>SN: 6/13/22</em>). A star orbiting a black hole at a safe distance won’t get eaten, but it will be pulled back and forth by the black hole’s gravity. Astronomers can detect the star’s motion and deduce the black hole’s presence.</p>



<p>Out of hundreds of thousands of stars that looked like they were tugged by an unseen object, just one seemed like a good black hole candidate. Follow-up observations with other telescopes <a href="https://academic.oup.com/mnras/advance-article-abstract/doi/10.1093/mnras/stac3140/6794289" target="_blank" rel="noopener">support the black hole idea</a>, the team reports November 2 in <em>Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society</em>.</p>



<p>Gaia BH1 is the nearest black hole to Earth ever discovered — the next closest is around 3,200 light-years away. But it’s probably not the closest that exists, or even the closest we’ll ever find. Astronomers think there are about 100 million black holes in the Milky Way, but almost all of them are invisible. “They’re just isolated, so we can’t see them,” says El-Badry, of the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics in Cambridge, Mass.</p>



<p>The next data release from Gaia is due out in 2025, and El-Badry expects it to bring more black hole bounty. “We think there are probably a lot that are closer,” he says. “Just finding one … suggests there are a bunch more to be found.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/cat-allergies-asthma-therapy-allergy-shots">Cat allergies may be tamed by adding an asthma therapy to allergy shots</a></h4>

              
                <p>Adding lab-made antibodies to allergy shots may better groom the immune system against cat allergies than standard shots alone. The combination therapy also reduced allergy symptoms for a year after stopping treatment, a new study finds</p>



<p>Allergy shots, also called immunotherapy, have been used for more than a century to reduce the itchy, watery eyes, sneezing, runny nose, congestion and other symptoms of allergies. The shots contain tiny amounts of the things people are allergic to, called allergens. People get shots weekly to monthly for three to five years and gradually build up tolerance to the allergen. </p>





<p>Despite their long use, scientists don’t know exactly how allergy shots work, says Lisa Wheatley, an allergist at the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases. Some people are essentially cured of their allergies, while others may need shots indefinitely. “We knew that if you were on immunotherapy for cat [allergies] … you will be better after that year, but you will not retain that benefit.”</p>



<p>The study was done to see if researchers could improve allergy therapy by reducing the amount of time shots were needed while still giving patients long-lasting relief. &nbsp;The team also hoped to better understand how immunotherapy works, she says.</p>



<p>When allergies strike, some immune cells produce alarm chemicals that trigger inflammation and other symptoms. “If we could dampen the signaling that says ‘danger,’ we could maybe improve immunotherapy,” Wheatley says.</p>



<p>She and colleagues used a monoclonal antibody called tezepelumab to block one of those alarm chemicals, known as thymic stromal lymphopoietin, or TSLP. The antibody has been used as an asthma treatment, so researchers already knew it is generally safe.</p>



<p>Researchers gave 121 cat allergy sufferers either standard allergy shots alone, tezepelumab alone, a combination of the two or a placebo. On its own, tezepelumab was no better than just a placebo, the researchers found.</p>



<p>After a year of treatment, people who got the combo had <a href="https://www.jacionline.org/article/S0091-6749(22)01333-1/pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reduced allergy symptoms</a> to cat dander squirted up their noses compared with people who got standard shots, researchers report October 9 in the <em>Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology</em>.</p>



<p>And levels of allergy-triggering antibodies called IgE fell and kept falling even a year after treatment stopped in people who got the combination. In people on standard shots, IgE levels started to claw their way back to baseline once treatment stopped, Wheatley says.</p>





<p>One reason the therapy may work is that it alters inflammation-triggering gene activity in some immune cells, the team found. Immune cells called mast cells made less tryptase — one of the major chemicals released in an allergic reaction — in people who got the combination therapy, an analysis of nasal swabs showed.</p>



<p>While the results are encouraging, it’s not clear that tezepelumab would work as well for other allergies, says Edward Zoratti, an allergist and immunologist at Henry Ford Hospital in Detroit who was not involved in the study. “Did they just get lucky and choose the right allergen?”</p>



<p>Cat allergies develop against a single sticky protein called <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/scientists-work-tame-cat-allergies-crispr-vaccine-food-therapy">Fel d1 that is in cats’ saliva</a> and in flakes of dead skin cells, or dander (<em>SN: 2/13/20</em>). Cockroach allergies, in contrast, can be produced by a variety of proteins.</p>



<p>Another possible drawback is that monoclonal antibodies are expensive, Zoratti says.</p>



<p>Much more research is needed before this or any other therapy is added to allergy shots in a doctor’s office, he says, but the study is important for understanding how allergy therapies work. “It’s one step in a long chain that will probably lead us to a really useful therapy in the future.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/alcohol-death-rate-rise-united-states-pandemic">The U.S.’s alcohol-induced death rate rose sharply in the pandemic’s first year</a></h4>

              
                <p>The death rate from alcohol use rose sharply in the United States in the first year of the pandemic. From 2019 to 2020, the rate of alcohol-induced deaths <a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.15620/%20cdc:121795" target="_blank" rel="noopener">climbed 26 percent</a>, from 10.4 per 100,000 people to 13.1 per 100,000, researchers report in a National Center for Health Statistics data brief published November 4.</p>



<p>The rate of alcohol-induced deaths has generally increased yearly for the last two decades, but the annual uptick tended to be 7 percent or less.</p>





<p>Deaths from alcoholic liver disease, which includes hepatitis and cirrhosis, were the most common driver of the increased rate. Deaths from mental and behavioral disorders due to alcohol use — mortality from dependence syndrome or withdrawal, for example — were the second most frequent contributor.</p>

<h3>Steep step-up</h3>



<p>The death rate from alcohol use jumped 26 percent overall from 2019 to 2020, a marked increase from previous years.</p>

<p>Other researchers have reported that <a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2770975" target="_blank" rel="noopener">adults were drinking more frequently, and more heavily</a>, early in the pandemic compared with the year before.</p>



<p>There is also evidence of an increase in cases of alcoholic liver disease. A study at Johns Hopkins Hospital in Baltimore reported that 2.3 times as many <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8919405/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">patients with severe alcoholic liver disease and with recent unhealthy drinking</a> were referred to their liver transplant center from July to December of 2020 compared with those months in 2019.</p>







<p>The jump in the alcohol-induced death rate isn’t surprising, considering how much data “had been pointing in this direction,” says transplant hepatologist Victor Chen of the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine.</p>



<p>The liver can regenerate, but only up to a point, Chen says. Once the liver is permanently damaged with scar tissue, the recommendation is to stop drinking alcohol to prevent more harm. The combination of underlying liver disease and more drinking can “cause liver symptoms, and ultimately death, if you don’t get a transplant early enough.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://xcorr.net/2022/11/03/how-do-science-startups-actually-work/">How science startups actually work</a></h4>

              
                <p>It’s tough being an academic these days. Between the tiny number of permanent positions and the systemic exploitation of cheap labour, people are looking for a way out. Students, postdocs, and even PIs are asking themselves: should I join a startup? Should I make my own startup? It sounds seductive—change the world! Make money! Keep doing research, but in a less toxic environment! Who wouldn’t want to jump in at the chance of working on something innovative and useful?</p>



<p>People often ask me about my thoughts on industry: after my PhD and postdoc, I’ve worked in industrial R&amp;D at big tech companies [Meta, Google], I’ve founded a medtech startup, I run a consulting business [<a href="https://xcorr.dev">xcorr.dev</a>], I advise and have equity in early-stage startups [<a href="https://www.artificio.org/">Artificio</a>], I was the founding CTO for an education non-profit [<a href="https://neuromatch.io">Neuromatch</a>]. Having experienced all these things, I want to take a step back to write this long note, so that you may learn from my tribulations.</p>



<p>There’s a lot of misleading information out there in the popular media: startups are depicted as exciting places where innovative research takes place outside the constraints of academia. I want to reset expectations and in particular explain how money flows in a startup. Startups lose money, at least for a while, and if they don’t figure out how to make money soon enough, they will go broke. Most PhD students &amp; many postdocs are isolated from the $ and ¢ aspects of running a lab, and academics sometimes express disdain at commercialism. However, for-profit startups, are, well, <em>for-profit</em>, and they need cash to keep going. If startup life appeals to you, you need to understand the money flow.</p>



<p>This is particularly important to understand the role of research in a startup. You may ask yourself: will I be able to do research if I join startup X? The answer is: <em>it depends</em>. I end with a checklist of things you might want to consider before you decide to dedicate multiple years of your life to a startup.</p>

<h1>What’s a startup anyway?</h1>



<p>A startup is a newly existing business that seeks to scale a given business model. For example, let’s say you have an idea for a new widget and you do market research to show people will buy said widgets. You may then convince investors to give you money to create a widget factory and start selling widgets. Congratulations! You have a startup.</p>

<p>Startups often start by losing money on salaries, capital expenditures (i.e. stuff like servers, factories, and so forth), lawyer fees, etc. This is known as the <em>valley of death</em>. Many startups are <em>default-dead</em>: to continue operating, they have to replenish their coffers with a constant influx of capital from external sources. These investments are conventionally structured in rounds, occurring every 12-18 months, starting with a pre-seed round, then going on to a seed round. Starting from series A onwards, startups often display revenue, though not enough to fund their massive expansion. Scaling is often necessary to make a startup ultimately profitable–a widget factory might cost the same regardless of whether it produces 1,000 widgets or a million. Therefore, by selling lots and lots of widgets, you spread the fixed cost of the widget factory over many widgets.</p>

<p>Startups’ long-term trajectory can be one of:</p>



<ul>
<li>run out of money and close down</li>



<li>get acquired</li>



<li>become public companies</li>



<li>remain private for a long time, for various strategic reasons</li>
</ul>



<p>To raise money, they sell off chunks of themselves to investors. Doing so dilutes the ownership of the original owners. Instead of owning 100% of my business, if I sell off 20% for a chunk of change (say, 200k$), then my business is valued 1M$ and I own 80% of it. Dilutive funding is often offered by venture capitalists (VC). Non-dilutive funding, which doesn’t cost any ownership, is done by government orgs (e.g. the NSF, various agencies in Canada, etc.).</p>

<p>Importantly, most startups don’t succeed – the general rule of thumb is that out 10 startups that receive seed investment, 7 will close down, 2 will break even, and only 1 will see a significant return on investment to the investor.</p>



<h1>What determines a startup’s value?</h1>



<p>Startups survive by selling chunks of themselves to investors. How do you value a chunk of a startup?</p>



<p>If I try to buy the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poutine">poutine stand down the street</a> to become a restaurateur, there’s a few well-established ways to price that: I might look at the price of poutines they sell a year (gross income), or their net income, that is, poutine sales minus salaries minus other expenditures. Then I could apply a multiplier to get a ballpark valuation number. If the industry-wide revenue multiple for an independent restaurant is .3, and they’re selling 300k$ worth of poutine a year, a smooth 45k$ might get me into the restaurant business.</p>



<p>But multipliers don’t work if a startup is making no money! You might be asking: how can you ask people for money to own something that makes no money? How is it that the poutine stand down the street—bringing real value to the people in the form of delicious carbs—can be bought for less than the price of a Tesla, while a guy with a half-baked idea and no sales can value his startup at 3M$?</p>



<p>One method to value a startup is <a href="https://www.hbs.edu/faculty/Pages/item.aspx?num=6515">the so-called VC method</a>. It states that the value of a startup is some discount factor for risk times the expected value of the business at some time in the future (say, 5 years). Let’s look at each of these in turn.</p>



<ul>
<li>Discount factor for risk: If I’m willing to take no risk at all, I can put money in high-savings rate account and make about 3% per year in these days of high interest rates. Free money! If I can afford a little risk, I can put money in an index fund and make an average of 8% a year, with some variance. Higher risk tolerance is rewarded with higher average returns. When an investor puts money in a startup, with a &gt;50% risk of losing all of it, they will require much higher multipliers for it to be worth it—perhaps on the order of 50% year-on-year. The total discount factor is equal to (1+d)^-X, where X is the number of years at maturity (say, X = 5)</li>



<li>Future value of the business: that can be estimated using the same type of calculation used to estimate the value of a poutine stand. Tech businesses have much higher multipliers (aka price-to-earnings) than brick-and-mortar independent restaurants: the industry average is 20. Thus, if your business could be making 10M$ in annual sales in 5 years, according to this calculation, it would be worth 200M$.</li>
</ul>



<p>I like to think about the discount factor in a slightly different way: I like to think about it in terms of p(things will work in X years). Hence, the value is:</p>



<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Ctextrm%7Bvalue%7D+%5Cpropto+PE+%5Ccdot+%28%5Ctextrm%7BExpected+yearly+sales+in+X+years%7D%29+%5Ccdot+p%28%5Ctextrm%7Bthings+will+work+in+X+years%7D%29&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=3a3a3a&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" srcset="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Ctextrm%7Bvalue%7D+%5Cpropto+PE+%5Ccdot+%28%5Ctextrm%7BExpected+yearly+sales+in+X+years%7D%29+%5Ccdot+p%28%5Ctextrm%7Bthings+will+work+in+X+years%7D%29&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=3a3a3a&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002 1x, https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Ctextrm%7Bvalue%7D+%5Cpropto+PE+%5Ccdot+%28%5Ctextrm%7BExpected+yearly+sales+in+X+years%7D%29+%5Ccdot+p%28%5Ctextrm%7Bthings+will+work+in+X+years%7D%29&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=3a3a3a&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002&#038;zoom=4.5 4x" alt="&#92;textrm{value} &#92;propto PE &#92;cdot (&#92;textrm{Expected yearly sales in X years}) &#92;cdot p(&#92;textrm{things will work in X years})" class="latex" /></p>



<p>Note: this is a highly simplified model, and doesn’t take into account that you may have several sales scenarios, each weighted by their likelihood, etc. The lessons are broadly the same regardless of your exact valuation model.</p>



<p>Generally, you’ll want each successive funding round to be at a valuation of 2–3X higher than the last one, otherwise you will quickly dilute yourself out of a business. Investors also hate so-called <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/downround.asp">down rounds</a>, where the startup is valued less than previously, because that means that they overpaid for their investment. Sometimes a miracle happens and you discover more yearly sales—equivalently, a larger total addressable market—prior to starting to sell things, but that is a very rare occurrence indeed. That means that the only thing you can really work on to increase the value of your startup and survive to live another day is to make your product or business “more certain to work” by a factor of 2–3X every 18–24 months. In other words: you should work to decrease risk.</p>



<h1>What kinds of risks do startups face?</h1>



<p>So far we’ve established that decreasing risk is a key activity in a startup. What kinds of risk are we talking about anyway?</p>



<h2>Market risks</h2>



<p>Will people want to buy the thing you’re selling at a price that will ultimately make you a profit? Generally, investors don’t like to invest in widget businesses where it’s not very clear whether anybody will buy the widget. You can address market risk by:</p>



<ul>
<li><em>Showing that you already have sales</em>. Definitely the best. If you have 100 clients willing to buy a thing at a decent price and you’re growing year-on-year by 10X, then it won’t be too hard for an investor to believe you have a viable business.</li>



<li><em>Showing that people are using the thing and they like it</em>. Maybe you haven’t figured out how to sell a widget, but you might be able to show that people use a free, minimalistic version of a thing (MVP) and love it. That can mean having alpha users or demo installs.</li>



<li><em>Showing that people will actually buy the thing once it’s made</em>. That can mean getting a letter-of-intent from some big client saying they’ll buy the widget once it’s made.</li>
</ul>



<p>In all these cases, you need to build things. It’s hard to get a letter of intent for something you can’t hold in your hand in a prototypical manner. To decrease market risk, you have to build a prototype and then a minimum viable product (MVP).</p>



<h2>Technological risk</h2>



<p>Perhaps the product you are building is based on a principle that has been demonstrated only on a small scale in a lab, or maybe even just on paper. The usual scale to establish the technological maturity of an idea is TRL (technological readiness level). It comes from NASA’s classification system to judge prospective technologies for use in space, but it’s been broadly adopted in early stage R&amp;D. The higher the TRL, the lower the risk.</p>

From Wikipedia.</figcaption></figure></div>


<p>Early-stage, pre-revenue startups will need very deep pockets to work on ideas at TRL1—TRL2. That really only makes sense if the market is so obviously large (”blockbuster”) that the risk and time expense can make sense. Maybe <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2022/07/19/google-chevron-invest-in-fusion-startup-tae-technologies.html">somebody will fund a TRL1 nuclear fusion startup</a>, because clean energy at scale is such a large market. Otherwise, TRL1—2 is usually done at research institutions with public money, with the outcome, knowledge, becoming a public good. Early-stage deep-tech startups typically focus on TRL3—6 instead.</p>



<p>Building an MVP can really decrease technological risk because it shows the thing actually exists. Generally it’s a bad idea to combine something that has high technological risk with high market risk. A better combo might be: show that something has a big, obvious addressable market if only this very difficult technological/science problem can be overcome by the world’s foremost expert in this area, who happens to be you. Or maybe you have already built a super special, super cool technology and you think, I think maybe somebody would buy this, but you need to do market research.</p>



<p><em>Aside &amp; rant</em>: it can be a pointless exercise to try to forecast how basic research ideas done at research institutions will translate into tangible, marketable goods, because there are so many steps between the research and its commercialization. That means that judging basic research based on commercialization potential (as funding agencies increasingly do) can be an exercise in futility. Fundamental research is better judged by criteria such as: is this interesting?</p>



<h2>Regulatory and IP risk</h2>



<p>If you do anything medical, much of the uncertainty will be regulatory. Is your medical device class II or class III? The burden of proof and the cost of trials in each case will be different. Do you have access to the necessary intellectual property (IP)? Can you protect yourself long enough to go to market without somebody doing the thing you were planning to do eating your lunch?</p>



<h2>Execution risk</h2>



<p>Sometimes all the stars are aligned: the market is there, the innovation works, you’re lawyered up, but you still fail to deliver a good product. Maybe you don’t hire the right people; people who are too research-y or insist on putting things which don’t work yet into production. You get into constant fights about priorities and every planning meeting is a mutiny. You get a lawsuit at an inopportune time. Many factors can converge to cause a good idea with a demonstrated market to fail if not executed properly.</p>



<h1>If it’s too good to be true, it probably is</h1>



<p>We hear a lot about “research-labs”-like startups that don’t have any visible products and that seem to be doing great. This sets a really bad precedent for students and postdocs, because it gives the impression that there’s some free money floating out there. <strong>If it looks too good to be true, it probably is</strong>.</p>



<p>We don’t hear so much about startups that fail, because dead men tell no tales: it’s similar to the file drawer problem in academia. We often hear of successful AI startups, but we seldom hear about the cautionary tale of ElementAI. ElementAI was a startup originated from Yoshua Bengio, Turing-award winning AI researcher. They used up a lot of money to bring AI-based solutions to businesses, but grew too fast without a laser-tight focus on a single, scaleable product that could be sold. The fact that it was started by somebody famous is completely irrelevant: it may have hurt them, because they were able to raise money too fast to get their feet solid and prove a product-market fit. At some point, the startup has to sell a product for more than the cost of the inputs to the product. In this case, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Element_AI">they were sold for scraps</a>, employee stock became worthless, and many wasted years of their lives in the debacle.</p>



<p>Understand the hypothesis underlying what a startup is doing and the addressable market. If it makes sense, jump in. If you cannot make the numbers add up and the people in the startup can’t give you a good story, you need to get out of there. I’ve heard students and postdocs tell me that they’re skeptical of startup X but want to jump in anyway, because, hey, what do they know? If you’re a <em>subject domain expert</em>, you often know more about the technology being developed and its risk profile than 90% of people involved. You should combine your pre-existing technical knowledge with knowledge about the market, which can be acquired pretty fast. If you do this, you can invest your time and energy on what you sincerely believe is a winner rather than engage in magical thinking.</p>



<h1>What can you do as a PhD to help your startup succeed?</h1>



<p>Now we get to the crux of my argument: your job, as a PhD in an early-stage startup, is to reduce risk. You have several ways of doing this:</p>



<ul>
<li>Helping to build an MVP or prototype</li>



<li>Talking to people who will use the product to make it better (needs-driven design)</li>



<li>Do research showing the efficacy of the product for its intended purpose</li>
</ul>



<p>On this last point, you might think that industrial research is less reliable (sloppier) than academic research: if you have financial incentives to show something is true, wouldn’t you want to show that it’s true? In fact, you have every incentive for the research to be correct – not as in “finding the answer management wants to be true”, but as in “finding the right answer”. Finding the right answer decreases the inherent risk in the venture, which means you’re likely to survive another day: if the hypothesis underlying the startup is wrong, you should pivot now rather than later when you’ve burned through your cashflow.</p>



<p>Because a pre-revenue startup has so much uncertainty and doesn’t have the cash flow to cushion the blows, you should be working on <strong>little R research</strong>. I would also argue that you should deeply understand the market at this point, and avoid doing R&amp;D fenced off from the business: your research needs to translate pretty quick into things people can buy, ideally within one round of financing (18–24 months).</p>



<h2>Papers, what are they good for?</h2>



<p>Publishing papers in this environment is a mixed bag. Positive incentives to publish include:</p>



<ul>
<li>researchers want papers, and keeping high-value researchers happy is often a primary incentive for the startup, as employee churn is expensive.</li>



<li>the research itself can bring value to the company by decreasing uncertainty and reorienting activities depending on findings.</li>



<li>the seal of approval from peer-reviewed research can reassure investors the work is innovative in ways and uncertainty has been decreased. Be careful though, ultimately, it’s not hard for an investor to find an expert senior postdoc and give them several hundreds of dollars to thoroughly review your claims. That due diligence is any many ways far more extensive than peer review ever could be.</li>



<li>recruiting high-value researchers can become easier if they have visibility into the research the company does. That’s also one reason many startups have company blogs.</li>



<li>research may be required to pass regulatory hurdles, for example with medical devices.</li>
</ul>



<p>However, there are many downsides:</p>



<ul>
<li>papers don’t pay the bills: clients do. Papers can be a huge distraction and encourage scientists to isolate themselves from the business and not contribute to product early on.</li>



<li>research creates intellectual property, which brings value to the company; but publishing that IP prevents patenting. It allows competitors to copy the innovation.</li>
</ul>



<p>In conclusion: an early-stage startup that doesn’t seem to have many clients but has a lot of papers coming out is usually a warning sign. As a large shareholder in a startup, or an early employee in charge of R&amp;D, you have to make sure you do the right kinds of research, and create a culture that incentivizes the continued existence of said startup.</p>



<p>Later-stage startups and companies with mature cashflows are in a better position to engage in big R research. Even then, however, the goal is rarely the production of knowledge, understood as a public good–though on occasion good PR could be valuable for secondary purposes like recruiting. The purpose instead is to perform research in such a way that ultimately feed into new products down the line that translate into sizeable revenue. Companies with long runways–for instance Meta with its Metaverse strategy–can afford to use a very long horizon to evaluate research. However, that’s only viable because Meta has tens of billions of dollars in cash reserves AND a positive cashflow. Most startups and companies are not in that case.</p>



<h1>How not to succeed as a startup</h1>



<p>You can learn from my mistakes. I was briefly the CTO of a medtech startup that used AI to treat a given neurological condition. As a PhD, it was my job to decrease the uncertainty surrounding the startup rapidly for us to raise money. I did all the activities expected of that role: created valuable IP that could be protected, did studies demonstrating our proof-of-concept, participated in product development, etc.</p>



<p>However, in doing so, I isolated myself from the marketing and fundraising aspects of the startups. What I should have focused more on was validating the market. Digging deeper and deeper, we realized that the market we had hoped for was smaller than anticipated as we uncovered a number of contraindications for the treatment we were building. To address a larger market through a different indication would have increased the uncertainty about efficacy to an unacceptable level. Ultimately, without a sizeable market, the opportunity was dead in the water. Although we could have continued to grind things out for a number of years, because the market opportunity was so small, it seemed a better trade-off to shut things down. A couple of papers and a patent are simply pointless for a startup unless you can turn that R&amp;D into something that can ultimately be sold.</p>



<h1>What about my favourite R&amp;D startup?</h1>



<p>I’ve shared my thoughts on the role of research in a for-profit startup with many over the years. I inevitably get pushback, often in the form of “what about startup X? It looks like they’re just doing R&amp;D and doing fine?” Let’s deconstruct some counterexamples that people frequently cite.</p>



<p>Disclaimer: although I worked at Facebook and Google, I don’t have any special insight about these startups that were ultimately acquired by Facebook and Google, I’m just reading the publicly available information.</p>



<h2>Deepmind</h2>



<p>Deepmind, the artificial-general-intelligence company, is an interesting case. It was acquired in 2014 by Google at a reported 600M$. At the time, they had about 75 employees. For a company that had no visible product, its exit paths were rather narrow: an early investor confided that had they not been acquired by Google, <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/11/11/deepmind-would-have-probably-failed-without-google-says-investor.html">they would have probably failed</a>. About 8M$ per employee is pretty expensive for an acquihire, but if you look at contemporary discussions on HackerNews, commenters <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=7127938">speculate that the core value of the company was indeed its people</a>: recruit AI researchers cheaply in Europe, repackage as a functioning R&amp;D team that could be sold to a tech giant. That would make Deepmind prior to its acquisition, in essence, a recruiter specialized in AI talent.</p>



<p>Compared to other acquisitions around the same time, it was cheap: WhatsApp was acquired the same year for 19B$, with 55 employees at the time, that would come with about 40X the price per employee. I don’t want to imply that Deepmind’s sale to Google was a firesale. However, in my mind, its sale was not the roaring success that some claim it was. Deepmind’s path was quite narrow, and I don’t think it’s replicable today.</p>



<h2>Ctrl-Labs</h2>



<p>Ctrl-Labs built neural interfaces for AR/VR. They assembled an R&amp;D team to create a neural interface that detect the smallest of neural impulse close to the wrist and translate that into commands to a computer. At the time of acquisition, they were–to the best of my ability to search through the internet wayback machine–a pretty small team, perhaps on the order of a dozen people. <a href="https://venturebeat.com/ai/facebook-acquires-ctrl-labs-to-advance-its-brain-machine-interface-efforts/#:~:text=And%20we%20want%20to%20build,it%20into%20consumer%20products%20faster.%E2%80%9D">They were acquired by Facebook in 2019 for a reported 500M$-1B$</a>. Importantly, however, they had real protected intellectual property – <a href="https://patents.google.com/?inventor=thomas+reardon&amp;oq=thomas+reardon">a portfolio of their own patents</a> plus <a href="https://betakit.com/ctrl-labs-acquires-norths-patents-for-myo-armband-technology/">IP acquired from North</a> (previously named Myo). Their R&amp;D had been translated to a real prototype, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3GtRhy1maxc">which they presented at conferences</a>. They had a real use case, which is interfacing for AR/VR. In other words, they had removed much of the technical uncertainty around the technology, in precisely the way I’m advocating here. In my view, it’s a good example of the role of R&amp;D is in an early stage startup.</p>



<h2>FROs &amp; OpenAI</h2>



<p>So far our discussion has been focused on for-profit startups, which are by the far the most common legal structure for what we call “startups”, and which have the constraints that I discussed previously. People are actively looking for different legal structures that allow them to do big-R research outside the confines of academia.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-022-00018-5">Focused Research Organizations (FROs) are a new kind of model that’s emerging that’s potentially very exciting</a>. They focus on building one highly specific public good (e.g. a tool, a dataset) that they can deliver within a time frame of ~5 years. Importantly, most FROs are non-profit organizations, and funders understand that the effort is oriented towards this specific outcome without the expectation of profit. They’re very much an experiment at this point, but it will be interesting to see what comes out them.</p>



<p>Another example of an alternative model is OpenAI. <a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2020/02/17/844721/ai-openai-moonshot-elon-musk-sam-altman-greg-brockman-messy-secretive-reality/">OpenAI</a> was started as a non-profit with a billion dollars in funding, and received a further injection of 1B$ from Microsoft following its re-incorporation as a limited-profit company. Much of their research is done out in the open (although GPT-3 and DALL-E2 checkpoints have not been released). Notice, however, that despite its legal status, OpenAI does have revenue through GPT-3. Indeed, non-profits or limited-profits still need to have a valid business model or constant cash influx to continue operating.</p>



<p>Perhaps a specific FRO’s cash flow looks like “we have exactly 30M$ from a donor to create a new tool, then we will release the tool and then shut down”. As long as everybody knows what they’re getting into, I applaud these efforts at finding alternatives. However, for startups incorporated as for-profits, which is the vast majority of startups, doing blue-sky research un-anchored to a product is a sure-fire recipe to run out of cash.</p>



<h1>A checklist for joining a startup</h1>



<p>If you’re thinking of joining a startup, ask yourselves these questions:</p>



<ul>
<li>Is the thing the startup working on necessary? Does anybody actually care?</li>



<li>Is this a cool, innovative product?</li>



<li>Do I think it’s doable, technically?</li>



<li>Do I think that people are going to buy the thing the startup sells?</li>



<li>Will I have the agency to positively affect the course of the startup?</li>



<li>How much can I grow as a scientist/programmer/data scientist within the group?</li>



<li>What do I think about the people that run this startup? Do they know what they’re doing? If it’s their first time, are they getting the mentorship they need?</li>



<li>Do they have money? How much? Where are they in their fundraising?</li>



<li>Will I be able to do the kinds of research I want to do? Little R research? Big R research? Product dev?</li>



<li>Are there any other red flags? Have several people asked “I don’t understand, how can they stay in business?” Is one of the founders a creep or a cult leader or has anger-management issues?</li>
</ul>



<h1>Conclusion</h1>



<p>A startup’s goal is to make money back to its investors by using a scalable business model. In an early stage startup, it is very rare that your job will be to “do research and publish papers”. Publishing papers can, in some circumstances, increase the value of the startup and keep it afloat, but much of the time it can be a distraction unless it’s aligned to business goals. Technical staff should understand these business goals and align to them. R&amp;D cannot be separated from the business until the startup is post-revenue and on more solid footing.</p>
