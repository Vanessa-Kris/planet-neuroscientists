<p><a href="https://bookshop.org/a/21798/9781982173357">Fen, Bog &amp; Swamp</a><br><em>Annie Proulx</em><br><em>Simon &amp; Schuster, $26.99</em></p>



<p>A recent TV ad features three guys lost in the woods, debating whether they should’ve taken a turn at a pond, which one guy argues is a marsh. “Let’s not pretend you know what a marsh is,” the other snaps. “Could be a bog,” offers the third.</p>



<p>It’s an exchange that probably wouldn’t surprise novelist Annie Proulx. While the various types of peatlands — wetlands rich in partially decayed material called peat — do blend together, I can’t help but think, after reading her latest book, that a historical distaste and underappreciation of wetlands in Western society has led to the average person’s confusion over basic peatland vocabulary.</p>





<p>In<em> Fen, Bog &amp; Swamp: A Short History of Peatland Destruction and Its Role in the Climate Crisis</em>, Proulx seeks to fill the gaps. She details three types of peatland: fens, which are fed by streams and rivers; bogs, fed by rainwater; and swamps, distinguishable by their trees and shrubs. While all three ecosystems are found around most of the world, Proulx focuses primarily on northwestern Europe and North America, where the last few centuries of modern agriculture led to a huge demand for dry land. Wet, muddy and smelly, wetlands were a nightmare for farmers and would-be developers. Since the 1600s, U.S. settlers have drained more than half of the country’s wetlands; just 1&nbsp;percent of British fens remains today.</p>





<p>Only recently have the consequences of these losses become clear. “We are now in the embarrassing position of having to relearn the importance of these strange places,” Proulx writes. For one, peatlands have great ecological value, supporting a variety of wildlife. They also <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/bogs-peatlands-fire-climate-change">sequester huge amounts of carbon dioxide</a>, and some peatlands prevent shoreline erosion, while buffering land from storm surges (<em>SN: 3/17/18, p. 20</em>). But the book doesn’t spend too much time on nitty-gritty ecology. Instead, Proulx investigates these environments in the context of their relationship with people.</p>



<p>Known for her fiction, Proulx, who penned <em>The Shipping News</em> and “Brokeback Mountain,” draws on historical accounts, literature and archaeological digs to imagine places lost to time. She challenges the notion that wetlands are purely unpleasant or disturbing — think Shrek’s swamp, where only an ogre would want to live, or the Swamps of Sadness in <em>The Neverending Story </em>that swallow up Atreyu’s horse.</p>



<p>Proulx jumps back as far as 20,000 years ago to the bottom of the North Sea, which at the time was a hilly swath called Doggerland. When sea levels rose in the seventh century B.C., people there learned to thrive on the region’s developing fens, hunting for fish and eels. In Ireland, “bog bodies” — many thought to be human sacrifices — have been preserved in the peat for thousands of years; Proulx imagines torchlit ceremonies where people were offered to the mud, a connection to the natural world that is hard for many people to comprehend today. These spaces were integrated into the local cultures, from Renaissance paintings of wetlands to British lingo such as <em>didder</em> (the way a bog quivers when stepped on). Proulx also reflects on her own childhood memories — wandering through wetlands in Connecticut, a swamp in Vermont — and describes how she, like writer Henry David Thoreau, finds beauty in these places. “It is … possible to love a swamp,” she says.</p>



<p>Fens, bogs and swamps are technically distinct, but they’re also fluid; one wetland may transition into another depending on its water source. This same fluidity is reflected in the book, where Proulx flits from one wetland to another, from one part of the world to another, from one millennium to another. At times didactic and meandering, Proulx will veer off to discuss humankind’s destructive tendency not just in wetlands, but nature in general, broadly rehashing aspects of the climate crisis that most readers interested in the environment are probably already familiar with. I was most enthralled — and heartbroken — by the stories I had never heard before: of “Yde Girl,” a redheaded teenager sacrificed to a bog; the zombie fires in Arctic peatlands that burn underground; and the ivory-billed woodpecker, a bird missing from southern U.S. swamps for almost a century.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/saba-caribbean-island-species-conservation">A Caribbean island gets everyone involved in protecting beloved species</a></h4>

              
                <p class="has-drop-cap" style="font-size:20px">The coral reef, once bustling with more than 5,000 long-spined sea urchins, became a ghost town in a matter of days. White skeletons with dangling spines dotted the reef near the Dutch Caribbean island of Saba, the water cloudy from the disintegrating corpses. In just a week last April, half of the urchins, <em>Diadema antillarum</em>, in a section of reef called “Diadema City” had died. In June, only 100 remained.</p>



<p>The mysterious die-off started sweeping across the Caribbean in February. It’s eerily similar to a mass mortality event in 1983 that wiped out as much as 99 percent of the Caribbean <em>Diadema</em> population — a huge blow to not only the urchins, which have not fully recovered four decades later, but also the reefs. Without urchins grazing, algae can overwhelm a reef, damaging adult coral and leaving nowhere for new coral to settle.</p>





<p>Before the die-off, Saba’s coral cover — the part of a reef that consists of live hard coral rather than sponges, algae or other organisms — hovered around 50 percent. Today, that number is down to 3 percent.</p>



<p>“It’s just downhill, downhill, downhill,” says Alwin Hylkema, a marine ecologist at Van Hall Larenstein University of Applied Sciences and Wageningen University in the Netherlands who is based in Saba (pronounced “say-bah”).</p>



<p>I learned about Saba’s sea urchin problem only shortly after I learned that the island existed. Saba is a blip in the Caribbean; at 13 square kilometers, it’s about a quarter the size of Manhattan, with the towering Mount Scenery volcano at its center. Its reefs attract scuba divers, but a lack of beaches shields it from regular Caribbean tourist traffic — hence its nickname, “the unspoiled queen.” What the island lacks in size and sand it makes up for with its great variety of species, its biodiversity. Steep cliffs support several micro­climates. In just a few hours, a visitor can hike from volcanic rock to grassy field to misty cloud forest.</p>



<p>This diversity makes Saba the perfect spot for Sea &amp; Learn, an annual educational program that brings scientists from around the world to the island. Former dive shop owner Lynn Costenaro launched the program in 2003 to encourage more divers to visit Saba during the off-season. But the event has grown to play an important role in educating the island’s 2,000 residents about their home’s unique wildlife and ecosystems.</p>



<p>Throughout October, the scientists present their research on everything from biology and geology to astronomy at restaurants and in plazas. Several researchers also host public research trips underwater and on shore, so attendees can see the lobsters, or rock formations or stars for themselves.</p>

<p>This kind of local engagement with the environment comes at a time when many species are at risk, and not just on Saba, says Severin Irl, an island ecologist at Goethe University Frankfurt in Germany. Although islands cover only about 7 percent of the world’s landmass, they are home to an estimated 20 percent of all species — and 75 percent of all documented extinctions.</p>



<p>Some island species occupy only one island; others are spread out in small populations across several islands. Species within small populations can develop a very narrow, island-specific set of adaptations, which spells trouble when humans and invasive species arrive. Today, any given plant or animal on an island is <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2351989421003978#fig0025">12 times as likely to go extinct as species on the mainland</a>, Irl and an international group of researchers reported in the November 2021 <em>Global Ecology and Conservation</em>. And the decline is speeding up at an unprecedented rate. As biodiversity decreases, islands lose the complexity that helps keep the ecosystem stable and less vulnerable to disruptions, such as climate change.</p>



<p>“We’re in the midst of a biodiversity crisis … and islands are really bearing the brunt of that global change,” says arachnologist Lauren Esposito of the California Academy of Sciences, who has <a href="https://www.seaandlearn.org/lauren-esposito">presented research</a> on spiders and scorpions at Sea &amp; Learn.</p>



<p>The features that put island inhabitants at risk — their small size and isolation — also make them wonderful laboratories. Like the famous Galápagos Islands that turned Charles Darwin on to natural selection, islands present opportunities to study individual species as well as ecosystem dynamics, in a relatively small microcosm. In 2021, the California Academy of Sciences launched Islands 2030, co-led by Esposito, in five tropical archipelagos, including the Lesser Antilles where Saba is located. The aim is to conduct biodiversity research as well as train local communities to become guardians of their environments. The program took its inaugural trip to Saba’s Sea &amp; Learn last October.</p>



<p>I attended that Sea &amp; Learn and tagged along on field trips to see what progress and pitfalls researchers had experienced while working on Saba to protect a tiny orchid, a bright-billed bird and those dying urchins.</p>



<h4>Counting orchids</h4>



<p>On my first night, I joined locals and tourists at the Brigadoon restaurant to hear Mike Bechtold talk about Saba’s orchids. Bechtold, a retired nuclear arms expert from Virginia who fell in love with orchids while serving in Korea, first traveled to the island in 2003 to study the flowers. He’s since presented several times at Sea &amp; Learn. This was his first time back in seven years.</p>



<p>After defining an orchid as a flowering plant with three petals and a laundry list of unusual attributes, Bechtold <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LIGqOKm_jNI">described the disorganized history of orchid research on Saba</a>, including a series of miscommunications that has resulted in count discrepancies. A recently published book identifies 22 species, while Bechtold counts 32.</p>



<p>“To know what we have to preserve, well, we at least have to know what is there,” says Michiel Boeken, a former secondary school teacher from the Netherlands who studied orchids on Saba during his 2010 to 2012 tenure as principal of the island’s only secondary school.</p>



<p>The morning after his presentation, Bechtold led a hike to Spring Bay to look for orchids. We walked along the island’s only major road — aptly named The Road. At the trailhead, we descended into a swath of trees laden with mosses and other plants. We’d only walked for about 10 minutes when Bechtold pointed out an <em>Epidendrum ciliare</em>, the most common orchid on Saba, perched on a tree.</p>

BOEKEN</span></figcaption></figure></div>


<p>Stepping carefully over hermit crabs, we looked for the pile of rocks that marked where to leave the trail to find another species, <em>Brassavola cucullata</em>. Bechtold, Boeken and colleagues had surveyed the Spring Bay population from 2011 to 2014 to see if Saba’s numbers were declining. As we lowered ourselves down the steep hillside, we eventually spied the tiny white and yellow flowers of <em>B. cucullata</em> atop a tall tree with a metal tag glued beneath it; it was #582 of 834 <em>B. cucullata </em>plants that Bechtold helped tag a decade earlier.</p>



<p>We counted the plant’s leaves and measured them. Bechtold’s team had found that larger plants with more leaves had a better chance of survival than smaller plants, as did plants that were higher off the ground, like #582. Plants close to the ground were often munched on by wild goats.</p>



<p>The orchid is found from Mexico to northern South America. But here, <a href="https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/epdf/10.1086/709399">the <em>B. cucullata</em> population was indeed declining</a>, with small plants dying and not many new plants starting to grow, the researchers reported in 2020 in the <em>International Journal of Plant Sciences</em>. Without counting flowers for many more years, if not decades, it will be hard to know if the decline reflects natural population dynamics or if it’s a troublesome trend.</p>



<p>Regardless of cause, the population’s small size makes the island’s<em> B. cucullata </em>vulnerable. A recent hurricane knocked over several trumpet trees hosting large orchid plants. Some of the plants were crushed; others, lowered to the ground when their tree toppled, faced death by goat chomping.</p>



<h4>Tracking red-billed tropicbirds</h4>



<p>A week after the orchid hike, I found myself perched on a boulder high up on a cliff at Tent Bay on the island’s southern coast, looking for nests tucked into narrow rock crevices. German ecologist Lara Mielke, another volunteer and I started out at dawn to beat the heat, climbing hand over foot up the exposed hill. Overhead, red-billed tropicbirds, with long white tails and bright crimson beaks, swooped out across the sea.</p>



<p>About 1,500 breeding pairs of <em>Phaethon aethereus mesonauta</em>, one of the three subspecies of red-billed tropicbirds, breed on Saba, as much as a quarter of the subspecies’s global population. Tropic­birds spend most of their lives at sea, only coming to land for a few months each year to breed and raise a single chick. Their cliffside nesting spot makes the birds hard to study even when they’re on land. Fortunately, on Saba and the neighboring island Saint Eustatius, or “Statia,” the terrain is tough but not impossible to scale.</p>

<p>While climbing, I was startled by an abrasive squawk coming from a deep crevice hiding a nest. But the birds are more squawk than bite, and Mielke was able to reach her arm into the small opening and extract the bird to wrap a band around its leg.</p>



<p>Tameness, helpful when it comes to banding, makes these birds vulnerable to invasive predators. Tropicbird chicks are often eaten by feral cats that roam the island’s cliffs. Over the years, the Saba Conservation Foundation has set up cat eradication programs with mixed success.</p>



<p>After banding the bird, Mielke handed me a warm egg she’d pulled from the nest. I held it in my palm as she filled a plastic bin with water. An egg’s buoyancy indicates how far along it is. We knew, though, that once the chick hatched, it probably wouldn’t live long. In past years, researchers have observed the disappearance of every chick at Tent Bay, presumably snatched by the feral cats.</p>



<p>Chicks have much better odds on the other side of the island. In 2011 and 2012, Boeken — involved in several conservation efforts on Saba — <a href="https://bioone.org/journals/ardea/volume-104/issue-3/arde.v104i3.a8/Breeding-Success-of-Red-Billed-Tropicbirds-iPhaethon-aethereus-i-on/10.5253/arde.v104i3.a8.short">found that 62 of 83 hatchlings, or 75 percent</a>, at Old Booby Hill near Spring Bay to the north survived to fledge the nest. And on Statia, which has no cat problem, as many as 90 percent of chicks survive after they’ve hatched. Though, for reasons still unknown, <a href="https://bioone.org/journals/ardea/volume-107/issue-3/arde.v107i3.a2/----Custom-HTML----Reproductive/10.5253/arde.v107i3.a2.short">their colonies produce much fewer chicks </a>because many eggs simply never hatch.</p>



<p>Tropicbirds are faithful to both their mate and nest site, sometimes even returning to the same rock cavity each year, says ecologist Hannah Madden of the Caribbean Netherlands Science Institute, who moved from the Netherlands to Statia in 2006 and has spearheaded Statia and Saba’s tropicbird research. But the birds may be loyal to a fault. If a nest is repeatedly robbed or eggs fail to hatch, the chances of successfully raising chicks may be increased by relocating or finding a new mate.</p>

<p>Madden and Mielke, working as an independent researcher, are now analyzing GPS data of the subspecies’s foraging patterns. The last Caribbean-wide assessment of seabirds <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/E-Schreiber-2/publication/272791650_West_Indian_Seabirds_a_Disappearing_Natural_Resource/links/5ea2fa5492851c87d1b13492/West-Indian-Seabirds-a-Disappearing-Natural-Resource.pdf#page=37">happened over two decades ago</a>, so Madden has been hosting webinars to teach people on other islands how to collect such data during next year’s nesting season.</p>



<p>“In 2023, we want people from as many islands as possible in the Caribbean to get out there and monitor the seabirds on their islands,” she says.</p>

<h4>Hitting home</h4>



<p>Peter Johnson, an 11th-generation Saba resident, teaches math and physics at the secondary school. Sometimes after class he sits outside the school and listens to the red-billed tropicbirds flying overhead.</p>



<p>“Their birdcall is so unique,” he says. “They’re certainly something that reminds me of home.”</p>



<p>Johnson was a kid when Sea &amp; Learn started in 2003. He still remembers when, in the fifth grade, scientists came to his classroom and let him try on a spelunking helmet used for cave exploration. Years later, he returned to Saba after earning degrees in engineering in Virginia. “You’re more inclined to be proud of where you’re from, the more you know about it,” he says.</p>



<p>Esposito, of the Islands 2030 initiative, recalls being impressed by the fluency of Saban youth when talking about nature. Sea &amp; Learn scientists visit Saba’s schools to teach about the island’s unique species. When Esposito asks students if they’ve seen the island’s local snake — its only snake, the red-bellied racer — they usually say yes. She doesn’t get the same answer on Statia or neighboring islands.</p>



<p>“I have seen the direct effect of Sea &amp; Learn,” she says. “There is this connection between the people coming to do research and the local population and communities that doesn’t exist in most other places.”</p>



<p>Sea &amp; Learn coordinator Emily Malsack hopes the program encourages locals to stay on Saba to work in conservation. It’s already having an impact. Johnson is now the president of the Saba Conservation Foundation. Saban native Dahlia Hassell-Knijff got a degree in biology in Mississippi, then returned to the island, where she oversees projects at the regional Dutch Caribbean Nature Alliance. She also grew up attending Sea &amp; Learn.</p>



<p>“It was a very tiny organization [at the time], but it didn’t seem tiny to me,” Hassell-Knijff says. “It was like a dream come true for a little kid.”</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" width="680" height="491" src="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/092422_saba_inline8.jpg" alt="Alwyn Hylkema talks about sea urchins to a crowd on Saba island" class="wp-image-3117522" srcset="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/092422_saba_inline8.jpg 680w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/092422_saba_inline8-530x383.jpg 530w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/092422_saba_inline8-623x450.jpg 623w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/092422_saba_inline8-258x186.jpg 258w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><figcaption><span class="caption wp-caption-3117522">A crowd gathered on a Saba plaza last October to hear researcher Alwin Hylkema talk about sea urchins. He has been restoring Diadema to the island’s reefs since 2017.</span><span class="credit wp-credit-3117522">Joe Snyder</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>Hassell-Knijff’s story is “an indication of progress that’s to come,” Esposito says. Islands 2030 plans to recruit early-career scientists from five archipelagoes to attend the California Academy of Sciences in San Francisco, where they can work toward an advanced degree and become part of a network of scientists from their archipelago. The hope is that this next generation will return to their home islands to become leaders in biodiversity science and conservation.</p>



<p>There’s a need for this support. Many researchers who study island biology travel from abroad, spend some time and leave, causing research to sputter and disrupting long-term studies that are crucial to understanding population trends of, say, orchids and tropicbirds. Mielke recently ended her six months on Saba to return to Germany, and after 16 years on Statia, Madden moved back to the Netherlands this summer.</p>



<p>“It’s just tough,” Madden says. “At this point, I don’t know who will take over the projects that I’m working on.” Bechtold, too, worries about who will track the orchids after he and Boeken retire from research and can no longer travel to Saba.</p>



<h4>Saving the urchins</h4>



<p>The night that marine ecologist Alwin Hylkema <a href="https://www.facebook.com/seaandlearn/videos/569244107627656">presented his research about <em>Diadema</em></a>, the plaza was packed with over 100 adults and children. Hylkema has become something of a local celebrity. At first, he conducted his urchin research from the Netherlands, visiting Saba twice a year, until he realized it made more sense to do his studies on site. He moved his family to Saba in 2019.</p>



<p>Since then, Hylkema has worked on restoring <em>Diadema</em> to the reefs around Saba. But it’s a challenge: After urchin larvae settle onto a reef, they are easily eaten by queen triggerfish and spiny lobsters. To help more of the animals survive to adulthood, Hylkema’s team has been collecting the youngsters, known as settlers, and growing them in a lab on Saba. Once the animals are a few centimeters wide and less likely to become a meal, the team returns them to the reefs.</p>



<p>In October 2021, things were starting to look up for the animals. That same week, <a href="https://www.saba-news.com/great-news-for-coral-reef-restoration-first-diadema-sea-urchins-cultured-on-saba/">Hylkema’s team bred <em>Diadema</em> in captivity for the first time in Caribbean history</a>.</p>



<p>The lab-grown urchin success came just in time. Hylkema anticipates producing 1,000 to 2,000 juveniles by the end of this year, which he hopes to use for restocking the devastated population at Diadema City. But that will have to wait until whatever is causing the die-off dissipates. Researchers at Cornell University are analyzing <em>Diadema</em> tissue sent by Hylkema and others to try to determine the cause, likely a pathogen.</p>

<p>One afternoon, I hitchhiked south from the town of Windwardside in the middle of the island to the harbor in Fort Bay, where Hylkema’s lab is located. I wanted to see the captive-bred <em>Diadema</em>. The crates in the lab were organized by urchin size: The youngest ones looked like inch-long pom-poms; older urchins resembled plums covered in long, black sewing needles.</p>



<p>In an air-conditioned storage container out back, specks of urchin larvae swirled in glass jars on a vibrating metal plate. After 50 or so days, the larvae will settle and eventually be transferred to the crates. If all goes well, the animals will grow in the lab until they’re big enough to be taken out to the reefs, where they’ll begin the next generation of <em>Diadema</em>.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/nasa-dart-asteroid-dimorphos-impact">NASA’s DART spacecraft just smashed into an asteroid — on purpose</a></h4>

              
                <p>Mission control rooms rarely celebrate crash landings. But the collision of NASA’s DART spacecraft with an asteroid was a smashing success.</p>



<p>At about 7:15 p.m. EDT on September 26, the spacecraft hurtled into Dimorphos, an asteroid moonlet orbiting a larger space rock named Didymos. The mission’s goal was to bump Dimorphos slightly closer to its parent asteroid, shortening its 12-hour orbit around Didymos by several minutes.</p>



<p>The <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/asteroid-moon-name-nasa-course-deflection-mission">Double Asteroid Redirection Test</a>, or DART, is the world’s first attempt to change an asteroid’s motion by ramming a space probe into it (<em>SN: 6/30/20</em>). Neither Dimorphos nor Didymos poses a threat to Earth. But seeing how well DART’s maneuver worked will reveal how easy it is to tamper with an asteroid’s trajectory — a strategy that could protect the planet if a large asteroid is ever discovered on a collision course with Earth.</p>



<p>“We don’t know of any large asteroids that would be considered a threat to Earth that are coming any time in the next century,” says DART team member Angela Stickle, a planetary scientist at the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory in Laurel, Md. “The reason that we are doing something like DART is because there are asteroids that we haven’t discovered yet.”</p>

<p>Astronomers have spotted almost all the kilometer-size asteroids in the solar system that could end civilization if they hit Earth, says Jessica Sunshine, a planetary scientist at the University of Maryland in College Park who’s also on the DART team. But when it comes to space rocks around 150 meters wide, like Dimorphos, “we only know where about 40 percent of those are,” Sunshine says. “And that is something that, if it did hit, would certainly take out a city.”</p>



<p>Dimorphos is a safe asteroid to give an experimental nudge, says Mark Boslough, a physicist at Los Alamos National Laboratory in New Mexico who has studied planetary protection but is not involved in DART. “It’s not on a collision course” with Earth, he says, and DART “can’t hit it hard enough to put it on a collision course.” The DART spacecraft weighs only as much as a couple of vending machines, whereas Dimorphos is thought to be nearly as hefty as Egypt’s Great Pyramid of Giza.</p>



<p>After a 10-month voyage, DART met up with Didymos and Dimorphos near their closest approach to Earth, about 11 million kilometers away. Up until the very end of its journey, DART could see only the larger asteroid, Didymos. But about an hour before impact, DART spotted Dimorphos in its field of view. Using its onboard camera, the spacecraft steered itself toward the asteroid moonlet and slammed into it at some 6.1 kilometers per second, or nearly 14,000 miles per hour.</p>

<p>DART’s camera feed went dark after impact. But another probe nearby caught the collision on camera. The Light Italian CubeSat for Imaging of Asteroids rode to Dimorphos aboard DART but detached a couple of weeks before impact to watch the event from a safe distance. Its mission was to whiz past Dimorphos about three minutes after DART’s impact to snap pictures of the crash site and the resulting plume of asteroid debris launched into space. The probe&#8217;s first images of DART&#8217;s demise were released September 27.</p>

<p>“I was absolutely elated, especially as we saw the camera getting closer and just realizing all the science that we’re going to learn,” said Pam Melroy, NASA Deputy Administrator, after the impact. “But the best part was seeing, at the end, that there was no question there was going to be an impact, and to see the team overjoyed with their success.”</p>



<p>DART’s impact is expected to shove Dimorphos into a closer, shorter orbit around Didymos. Telescopes on Earth can clock the timing of that orbit by watching how the amount of light from the double asteroid system changes as Dimorphos passes in front of and behind Didymos.</p>

<p>“It’s really a beautifully conceived experiment,” Boslough says. In the coming weeks, dozens of telescopes across every continent will watch Dimorphos to see how much DART changed its orbit. The Hubble and James Webb space telescopes may also get images.</p>







<p>“It’ll be really interesting to see what comes out,” says Amy Mainzer, a planetary scientist at the University of Arizona in Tucson who is not involved in DART. “Asteroids have a way of surprising us,” she says, because it’s hard to know a space rock’s precise chemical makeup and internal structure based on observations from Earth. So Dimorphos’ motion post-impact may not exactly match researchers’ expectations.</p>



<p>The DART team will compare data on Dimorphos’ new orbit with their computer simulations to see how close those models were to predicting the asteroid’s actual behavior and tweak them accordingly. “If we can get our models to reproduce what actually happened, then you can use those models to [plan for] other scenarios that might show up in the future” — like the discovery of a real killer asteroid, says DART team member Wendy Caldwell, a mathematician and planetary scientist at Los Alamos National Laboratory.</p>



<p>“No matter what happens,” she says, “we will get information that is valuable to the scientific community and to the planetary defense community.”&nbsp;</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/maya-cacao-ceramics-royals-currency-ritual">In Maya society, cacao use was for everyone, not just royals</a></h4>

              
                <p>In ancient Maya civilization, cacao wasn’t just for the elites.</p>



<p>Traces of the sacred plant <a href="https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2121821119">show up in ceramics</a> from all types of neighborhoods and dwellings in and around a former Maya city, researchers report September 26 in the <em>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences</em>. The finding suggests that, contrary to previous thinking, cacao was consumed at every social level of Maya society.</p>



<p>“Now we know that the rituals the elite depict with cacao were likely played out, like Thanksgiving, like any other ritual, by everyone,” says Anabel Ford, an archaeologist at the University of California, Santa Barbara.</p>





<p>Cacao — which chocolate is made from — was sacred to the ancient Maya, consumed in rituals and used as a currency. The cacao tree (<em>Theobroma cacao</em>) itself was linked to Hun Hunahpu, the maize god. Previous research found cacao in ceremonial vessels and elite burials, suggesting that its use was restricted to those at the top.</p>



<p>To explore the extent to which cacao was used in <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/laser-mapping-shows-surprising-complexity-maya-civilization">broader Maya society</a>, Ford and colleagues examined 54 ceramic shards dating from A.D. 600 to 900 (<em>SN: 9/27/18</em>). The shards come from jars, mixing bowls, serving plates and vases thought to be drinking vessels. All the pieces were found in residential and ceremonial civic areas of varying size and status from city centers, foothills, upland areas and the valley around the former Maya city of El Pilar, on the present-day border of Guatemala and Belize.</p>



<p>To identify cacao, the researchers searched for theophylline, a compound found in trace amounts in the plant. The team found the compound on more than half of the samples, on all types of ceramics and distributed throughout social contexts.</p>



<p>Future research will move beyond who consumed cacao and explore the role of farmers in managing the critical resource. “A better question is to understand who grew it,” Ford says, because those people probably had greater access to the prized commodity.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/mangrove-forest-grow-moon-orbit-lunar-cycle">Mangrove forests expand and contract with a lunar cycle</a></h4>

              
                <p>The glossy leaves and branching roots of mangroves are downright eye-catching, and now a study finds that the moon plays a special role in the vigor of these trees.</p>



<p>Long-term tidal cycles <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.abo6602">set in motion by the moon</a> drive, in large part, the expansion and contraction of mangrove forests in Australia, researchers report in the Sept. 16 <em>Science Advances</em>. This discovery is key to predicting when stands of mangroves, which are good at sequestering carbon and <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/climate-change-natural-carbon-stores-new-map">could help fight climate change</a>, are most likely to proliferate (<em>SN: 11/18/21</em>). Such knowledge could inform efforts to protect and restore the forests.</p>





<p>Mangroves are coastal trees that <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/kenya-mangrove-trees-forest-carbon-storage-climate">provide habitat for fish and buffer against erosion</a> (<em>SN: 9/14/22</em>). But in some places, the forests face a range of threats, including coastal development, pollution and land clearing for agriculture. To get a bird’s-eye view of these forests, Neil Saintilan, an environmental scientist at Macquarie University in Sydney, and his colleagues turned to satellite imagery. Using NASA and U.S. Geological Survey Landsat data from 1987 to 2020, the researchers calculated how the size and density of mangrove forests across Australia changed over time.</p>



<p>After accounting for persistent increases in these trees’ growth — probably due to rising carbon dioxide levels, higher sea levels and increasing air temperatures — Saintilan and his colleagues noticed a curious pattern. Mangrove forests tended to expand and contract in both extent and canopy cover in a predictable manner. “I saw this 18-year oscillation,” Saintilan says.</p>



<p>That regularity got the researchers thinking about the moon. Earth’s nearest celestial neighbor has <a href="https://moon.nasa.gov/moon-in-motion/tides/">long been known to help drive the tides</a>, which deliver water and necessary nutrients to mangroves. A rhythm called the lunar nodal cycle could explain the mangroves’ growth pattern, the team hypothesized.</p>



<p>Over the course of 18.6 years, the plane of the moon’s orbit around Earth slowly tips. When the moon’s orbit is the least tilted relative to our planet’s equator, semidiurnal tides — which consist of two high and two low tides each day — tend to have a larger range. That means that in areas that experience semidiurnal tides, higher high tides and lower low tides are generally more likely. The effect is caused by the angle at which the moon tugs gravitationally on the Earth. &nbsp;</p>



<p>Saintilan and his colleagues found that mangrove forests experiencing semidiurnal tides tended to be larger and denser precisely when higher high tides were expected based on the moon’s orbit. The effect even seemed to outweigh other climatic drivers of mangrove growth, such as El Niño conditions. Other regions with mangroves, such as Vietnam and Indonesia, probably experience the same long-term trends, the team suggests.</p>



<p>Having access to data stretching back decades was key to this discovery, Saintilan says. “We’ve never really picked up before some of these longer-term drivers of vegetation dynamics.”</p>



<p>It’s important to recognize this effect on mangrove populations, says Octavio Aburto-Oropeza, a marine ecologist at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography in La Jolla, Calif., who was not involved in the research.</p>



<p>Scientists now know when some mangroves are particularly likely to flourish and should make an extra effort at those times to promote the growth of these carbon-sequestering trees, Aburto-Oropeza says. That might look like added limitations on human activity nearby that could harm the forests, he says. “We should be more proactive.”&nbsp;</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/olivine-deep-earthquake-mineral-pressure-temperature">Here’s how olivine may trigger deep earthquakes</a></h4>

              
                <p>Cocooned within the bowels of the Earth, one mineral’s metamorphosis into another may trigger some of the deepest earthquakes ever detected.</p>



<p>These cryptic tremors — known as deep-focus earthquakes — are a seismic conundrum. They violently rupture at depths greater than 300 kilometers, where intense temperatures and pressures are thought to force rocks to flow smoothly. Now, experiments suggest that those same hellish conditions might also sometimes transform olivine — the primary mineral in Earth’s mantle — into the mineral wadsleyite. This mineral switch-up can <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-022-32923-8">destabilize the surrounding rock</a>, enabling earthquakes at otherwise impossible depths, mineral physicist Tomohiro Ohuchi and colleagues report September 15 in <em>Nature Communications.</em></p>





<p>“It’s been a real puzzle for many scientists because earthquakes shouldn’t occur deeper than 300 kilometers,” says Ohuchi, of Ehime University in Matsuyama, Japan.</p>



<p>Deep-focus earthquakes usually occur at subduction zones where <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/earth-plate-tectonics-volcanoes-earthquakes-faults">tectonic plates</a> made of oceanic crust — rich in olivine — plunge toward the mantle (<em>SN: 1/13/21</em>). Since the quakes’ seismic waves lose strength during their long ascent to the surface, they aren’t typically dangerous. But that doesn’t mean the quakes aren’t sometimes powerful. In 2013, a magnitude 8.3 deep-focus quake struck around 609 kilometers below the Sea of Okhotsk, just off Russia’s eastern coast.</p>



<p>Past studies hinted that <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/348720a0">unstable olivine crystals could spawn deep quakes</a>. But those studies tested other minerals that were similar in composition to olivine but deform at lower pressures, Ohuchi says, or the experiments didn’t strain samples enough to form faults.</p>



<p>He and his team decided to put olivine itself to the test. To replicate conditions deep underground, the researchers heated and squeezed olivine crystals up to nearly 1100° Celsius and 17 gigapascals. Then the team used a mechanical press to further compress the olivine slowly and monitored the deformation.</p>



<p>From 11 to 17 gigapascals and about 800° to 900° C, the olivine recrystallized into thin layers containing new wadsleyite and smaller olivine grains. The researchers also found tiny faults and recorded bursts of sound waves — indicative of miniature earthquakes. Along subducting tectonic plates, many of these thin layers grow and link to form weak regions in the rock, upon which faults and earthquakes can initiate, the researchers suggest.</p>



<p>“The transformation really wreaks havoc with the [rock’s] mechanical stability,” says geophysicist Pamela Burnley of the University of Nevada, Las Vegas, who was not involved in the research. The findings help confirm that olivine transformations are enabling deep-focus earthquakes, she says.</p>



<p>Next, Ohuchi’s team plans to experiment on olivine at even higher pressures to gain insights into the mineral’s deformation at greater depths.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/neptune-rings-new-image-james-webb-telescope">Here is the first direct look at Neptune’s rings in more than 30 years</a></h4>

              
                <p>Humankind is seeing Neptune’s rings in a whole new light thanks to the James Webb Space Telescope.</p>



<p>In an infrared image released September 21, Neptune and its gossamer diadems of dust <a href="https://webbtelescope.org/contents/news-releases/2022/news-2022-046/">take on an ethereal glow</a> against the inky backdrop of space. The stunning portrait is a huge improvement over the rings’ previous close-up, which was taken more than 30 years ago.</p>



<p>Unlike the dazzling belts encircling Saturn, Neptune’s rings appear dark and faint in visible light, making them difficult to see from Earth. The last time anyone saw Neptune’s rings was in 1989, when <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/nostalgic-voyager-documentary-relives-first-exploration-solar-system">NASA’s Voyager 2 spacecraft</a>, after tearing past the planet, snapped a couple grainy photos from roughly 1 million kilometers away (<em>SN: 8/7/17</em>). In those photos, taken in visible light, <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.246.4936.1422">the rings appear as thin, concentric arcs</a>.</p>



<p>As Voyager 2 continued to interplanetary space, Neptune’s rings once again went into hiding — until July. That’s when the <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/james-webb-space-telescope-first-image-nasa">James Webb Space Telescope</a>, or JWST, turned its sharp, infrared gaze toward the planet from roughly 4.4 billion kilometers away (<em>SN: 7/11/22</em>).</p>

<p>Neptune itself appears mostly dark in the new image. That’s because methane gas in the planet’s atmosphere absorbs much of its infrared light. A few bright patches mark where high-altitude methane ice clouds reflect sunlight.</p>



<p>And then there are the ever-elusive rings. “The rings have lots of ice and dust in them, which are extremely reflective in infrared light,” says Stefanie Milam, a planetary scientist at NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Md., and one of JWST’s project scientists. The enormity of the telescope’s mirror also makes its images extra sharp. “JWST was designed to look at the first stars and galaxies across the universe, so we can really see fine details that we haven’t been able to see before,” Milam says.</p>



<p>Upcoming JWST observations will look at Neptune with other scientific instruments. That should provide new intel on the rings’ composition and dynamics, as well as on how Neptune’s clouds and storms evolve, Milam says. “There’s more to come.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/alphafold-ai-protein-structure-folding-prediction">Has AlphaFold actually solved biology’s protein-folding problem?</a></h4>

              
                <p class="has-drop-cap" style="font-size:20px">As people around the world marveled in July at the most detailed pictures of the cosmos snapped by the James Webb Space Telescope, biologists got their first glimpses of a different set of images — ones that could help revolutionize life sciences research.</p>



<p>The images are the predicted 3-D shapes of more than 200 million proteins, rendered by an artificial intelligence system called AlphaFold. “You can think of it as covering the entire protein universe,” said Demis Hassabis at a July 26 news briefing. Hassabis is cofounder and CEO of DeepMind, the London-based company that created the system. Combining several deep-learning techniques, the computer program is trained to predict protein shapes by recognizing patterns in structures that have already been solved through decades of experimental work using electron microscopes and other methods.</p>





<p>The AI’s first splash came in 2021, with predictions for 350,000 protein structures — including almost all known human proteins. DeepMind partnered with the European Bioinformatics Institute of the European Molecular Biology Laboratory to make the structures available in a public database.</p>



<p>July’s massive new release expanded the library to “almost every organism on the planet that has had its genome sequenced,” Hassabis said. “You can look up a 3-D structure of a protein almost as easily as doing a key word Google search.”</p>



<p>These are predictions, not actual structures. Yet researchers have used some of the 2021 predictions to develop <a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.05.24.493318v1">potential new malaria vaccines</a>, improve understanding of Parkinson’s disease, work out how to protect honeybee health, gain insight into human evolution and more. DeepMind has also focused AlphaFold on neglected tropical diseases, including Chagas disease and leishmaniasis, which can be debilitating or lethal if left untreated.</p>



<div class="wp-block-sciencenews-content-sidebar">
<h4>Expanding the protein universe&nbsp; </h4>



<p>Decades of slow-going experiments have revealed the structure of more than 194,000 proteins, all housed in the Protein Data Bank. In 2021, the AlphaFold project released predicted structures for about 1 million proteins, including almost all known human proteins. This year, the AlphaFold database exploded with predicted structures for more than 200 million proteins.</p>

<p>The release of the vast dataset was greeted with excitement by many scientists. But others worry that researchers will take the predicted structures as the true shapes of proteins. There are still things AlphaFold can’t do — and wasn’t designed to do — that need to be tackled before the protein cosmos completely comes into focus.</p>



<p>Having the new catalog open to everyone is “a huge benefit,” says Julie Forman-Kay, a protein biophysicist at the Hospital for Sick Children and the University of Toronto. In many cases, AlphaFold and <a href="https://www.ipd.uw.edu/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Baek_etal_Science2021_RoseTTAFold.pdf">RoseTTAFold</a>, another AI researchers are excited about, predict shapes that match up well with protein profiles from experiments. But, she cautions, “it’s not that way across the board.”</p>



<p>Predictions are more accurate for some proteins than for others. Erroneous predictions could leave some scientists thinking they understand how a protein works when really, they don’t. Painstaking experiments remain crucial to understanding how proteins fold, Forman-Kay says. “There’s this sense now that people don’t have to do experimental structure determination, which is not true.”</p>

<h4>Plodding progress</h4>



<p>Proteins start out as long chains of amino acids and fold into a host of curlicues and other 3-D shapes. Some resemble the tight corkscrew ringlets of a 1980s perm or the pleats of an accordion. Others could be mistaken for a child’s spiraling scribbles.</p>



<p>A protein’s architecture is more than just aesthetics; it can determine how that protein functions. For instance, proteins called enzymes need a pocket where they can capture small molecules and carry out chemical reactions. And proteins that work in a protein complex, two or more proteins interacting like parts of a machine, need the right shapes to snap into formation with their partners.</p>



<p>Knowing the folds, coils and loops of a protein’s shape may help scientists decipher how, for example, a mutation alters that shape to cause disease. That knowledge could also help researchers make better vaccines and drugs.</p>



<p>For years, scientists have bombarded protein crystals with X-rays, flash frozen cells and examined them under high­powered electron microscopes, and used other methods to discover the secrets of protein shapes. Such experimental methods take “a lot of personnel time, a lot of effort and a lot of money. So it’s been slow,” says Tamir Gonen, a membrane biophysicist and Howard Hughes Medical Institute investigator at the David Geffen School of Medicine at UCLA.</p>

<p>Such meticulous and expensive experimental work has uncovered the 3-D structures of more than 194,000 proteins, their data files stored in the Protein Data Bank, supported by a consortium of research organizations. But the accelerating pace at which geneticists are deciphering the DNA instructions for making proteins has far outstripped structural biologists’ ability to keep up, says systems biologist Nazim Bouatta of Harvard Medical School. “The question for structural biologists was, how do we close the gap?” he says.</p>



<p>For many researchers, the dream has been to have computer programs that could examine the DNA of a gene and predict how the protein it encodes would fold into a 3-D shape.</p>



<h4>Here comes AlphaFold</h4>



<p>Over many decades, scientists made progress toward that AI goal. But “until two years ago, we were really a long way from anything like a good solution,” says John Moult, a computational biologist at the University of Maryland’s Rockville campus.</p>



<p>Moult is one of the organizers of a competition: the Critical Assessment of protein Structure Prediction, or CASP. Organizers give competitors a set of proteins for their algorithms to fold and compare the machines’ predictions against experimentally determined structures. Most AIs failed to get close to the actual shapes of the proteins.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-pullquote alignright"><blockquote><p>“Structure doesn’t tell you everything about how a protein works.”</p><cite>Jane Dyson</cite></blockquote></figure>



<p>Then in 2020, <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-021-03819-2">AlphaFold</a> showed up in a big way, predicting the structures of 90 percent of test proteins with high accuracy, including two-thirds with accuracy rivaling experimental methods.</p>



<p>Deciphering the structure of single proteins had been the core of the CASP competition since its inception in 1994. With AlphaFold’s performance, “suddenly, that was essentially done,” Moult says.</p>



<p>Since AlphaFold’s 2021 release, more than half a million scientists have accessed its database, Hassabis said in the news briefing. Some researchers, for example, have used AlphaFold’s predictions to help them get closer to completing a massive biological puzzle: the nuclear pore complex. Nuclear pores are key portals that allow molecules in and out of cell nuclei. Without the pores, cells wouldn’t work properly. Each pore is huge, relatively speaking, composed of about 1,000 pieces of 30 or so different proteins. Researchers had previously managed to place about 30 percent of the pieces in the puzzle.</p>

<h3>The nuclear pore</h3>



<p>Researchers previously solved about 30 percent of the 1,000-piece puzzle that is the nuclear pore complex. AlphaFold helped make sense of experimental data to complete 60 percent of the structure.</p>

<p>That puzzle is now <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.abm9506">almost 60 percent complete</a>, after combining AlphaFold predictions with experimental techniques to understand how the pieces fit together, researchers reported in the June 10 <em>Science</em>.</p>



<p>Now that AlphaFold has pretty much solved how to fold single proteins, this year CASP organizers are asking teams to work on the next challenges: Predict the structures of RNA molecules and model how proteins interact with each other and with other molecules.</p>



<p>For those sorts of tasks, Moult says, deep-learning AI methods “look promising but have not yet delivered the goods.”</p>



<h4>Where AI falls short</h4>



<p>Being able to model protein interactions would be a big advantage because most proteins don’t operate in isolation. They work with other proteins or other molecules in cells. But AlphaFold’s accuracy at predicting how the shapes of two proteins might change when the proteins interact are “nowhere near” that of its spot-on projections for a slew of single proteins, says Forman-Kay, the University of Toronto protein biophysicist. That’s something AlphaFold’s creators acknowledge too.</p>



<p>The AI trained to fold proteins by examining the contours of known structures. And many fewer multiprotein complexes than single proteins have been solved experimentally.</p>

<p>Forman-Kay studies proteins that refuse to be confined to any particular shape. These <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/disorder-work-2">intrinsically disordered proteins</a> are typically as floppy as wet noodles (<em>SN: 2/9/13, p. 26</em>). Some will fold into defined forms when they interact with other proteins or molecules. And they can fold into new shapes when paired with different proteins or molecules to do various jobs.</p>



<p>AlphaFold’s <a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.02.18.481080v1">predicted shapes</a> reach a high confidence level for about 60 percent of wiggly proteins that Forman-Kay and colleagues examined, the team reported in a preliminary study posted in February at bioRxiv.org. Often the program depicts the shapeshifters as long corkscrews called alpha helices.</p>



<p>Forman-Kay’s group compared AlphaFold’s predictions for three disordered proteins with experimental data. The structure that the AI assigned to a protein called alpha-synuclein resembles the shape that the protein takes when it interacts with lipids, the team found. But that’s not the way the protein looks all the time.</p>



<p>For another protein, called eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E-binding protein 2, AlphaFold predicted a mishmash of the protein’s two shapes when working with two different partners. That Frankenstein structure, which doesn’t exist in actual organisms, could mislead researchers about how the protein works, Forman-Kay and colleagues say.</p>

<p>AlphaFold may also be a little too rigid in its predictions. A static “structure doesn’t tell you everything about how a protein works,” says Jane Dyson, a structural biologist at the Scripps Research Institute in La Jolla, Calif. Even single proteins with generally well-defined structures aren’t frozen in space. Enzymes, for example, undergo small shape changes when shepherding chemical reactions.</p>



<p>If you ask AlphaFold to predict the structure of an enzyme, it will show a fixed image that may closely resemble what scientists have determined by X-ray crystallography, Dyson says. “But [it will] not show you any of the subtleties that are changing as the different partners” interact with the enzyme.</p>



<p>“The dynamics are what Mr. AlphaFold can’t give you,” Dyson says.</p>



<h4>A revolution in the making</h4>



<p>The computer renderings do give biologists a head start on solving problems such as how a drug might interact with a protein. But scientists should remember one thing: “These are models,” not experimentally deciphered structures, says Gonen, at UCLA.</p>



<p>He uses AlphaFold’s protein predictions to help make sense of experimental data, but he worries that researchers will accept the AI’s predictions as gospel. If that happens, “the risk is that it will become harder and harder and harder to justify why you need to solve an experimental structure.” That could lead to reduced funding, talent and other resources for the types of experiments needed to check the computer’s work and forge new ground, he says.</p>

<p>Harvard Medical School’s Bouatta is more optimistic. He thinks that researchers probably don’t need to invest experimental resources in the types of proteins that AlphaFold does a good job of predicting, which should help structural biologists triage where to put their time and money.</p>



<p>“There are proteins for which AlphaFold is still struggling,” Bouatta agrees. Researchers should spend their capital there, he says. “Maybe if we generate more [experimental] data for those challenging proteins, we could use them for retraining another AI system” that could make even better predictions.</p>



<p>He and colleagues have already reverse engineered AlphaFold to make a version called OpenFold that researchers can train to solve other problems, such as those gnarly but important protein complexes.</p>



<p>Massive amounts of DNA generated by the <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/century/dna-genetics-genome-code-medicine-diversity">Human Genome Project</a> have made a wide range of biological discoveries possible and opened up new fields of research (<em>SN: 2/12/22, p. 22</em>). Having structural information on 200 million proteins could be similarly revolutionary, Bouatta says.</p>



<p>In the future, thanks to AlphaFold and its AI kin, he says, “we don’t even know what sorts of questions we might be asking.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/neutrino-particle-universe-matter-antimatter-mystery">How ghostly neutrinos could explain the universe’s matter mystery</a></h4>

              
                <p>The answer to one of the greatest mysteries of the universe may come down to one of the smallest, and spookiest, particles.</p>



<p>Matter is common in the cosmos. Everything around us — from planets to stars to puppies — &nbsp;is made up of matter. But matter has a flip side: antimatter. Protons, electrons and other particles all have antimatter counterparts: antiprotons, positrons, etc. Yet for some reason antimatter is much rarer than matter — and no one knows why.</p>





<p>Physicists believe the universe was born with equal amounts of matter and antimatter. Since matter and antimatter counterparts annihilate on contact, that suggests the universe should have ended up with nothing but energy. Something must have tipped the balance.</p>



<p>Some physicists think lightweight subatomic particles called neutrinos could point to an answer. These particles are <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/neutrino-max-possible-mass-tiny-new-estimate-particle-physics">exceedingly tiny</a>, with less than a millionth the mass of an electron (<em>SN: 4/21/21</em>). They’re produced in radioactive decays and in the sun and other cosmic environments. Known for their ethereal tendency to evade detection, neutrinos have earned the nickname “ghost particles.”&nbsp; These spooky particles, originally thought to have no mass at all, have a <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/neutrinos-identity-shift-snares-physics-nobel">healthy track record</a> of producing scientific surprises (<em>SN: 10/6/15</em>).</p>



<p>Now researchers are building enormous detectors to find out if neutrinos could help solve the mystery of the universe’s matter. The <a href="https://www-sk.icrr.u-tokyo.ac.jp/en/hk/">Hyper-Kamiokande</a> experiment in Hida City, Japan, and the <a href="https://www.dunescience.org/">Deep Underground Neutrino Experiment</a> in Lead, S.D., will study neutrinos and their antimatter counterparts, antineutrinos. A difference in neutrinos’ and antineutrinos’ behavior might hint at the origins of the matter-antimatter imbalance, scientists suspect.</p>



<p>Watch the video below to find out how neutrinos might reveal why the universe contains, well, anything at all.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/face-mask-sensor-airborne-virus-detection-covid">This face mask can sense the presence of an airborne virus</a></h4>

              
                <p>Face masks — the unofficial symbol of the COVID-19 pandemic — are leveling up.</p>



<p>A mask outfitted with special electronics can detect SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, and other airborne viruses <a href="https://www.cell.com/matter/fulltext/S2590-2385(22)00477-5">within 10 minutes of exposure</a>, materials researcher Yin Fang and colleagues report September 19 in <em>Matter</em>.</p>



<p>“The lightness and wearability of this face mask allows users to wear it anytime, anywhere,” says Fang, of Tongji University in Shanghai. “It’s expected to serve as an early warning system to prevent large outbreaks of respiratory infectious diseases.”</p>

<p>Airborne viruses can hitch a ride between hosts in the air droplets that people breathe in and out. People infected with a respiratory illness can expel thousands of virus-containing droplets by talking, coughing and sneezing. Even those with no signs of being sick can sometimes pass on these viruses; people who are infected with SARS-CoV-2 can start infecting others <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coronavirus-most-contagious-before-during-first-week-symptoms">at least two to three days before showing symptoms</a> (<em>SN: 3/13/20</em>). So viruses often have a head start when it comes to infecting new people.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Fang and his colleagues designed a special sensor that reacts to the presence of certain viral proteins in the air and attached it to a face mask. The team then spritzed droplets containing proteins produced by the viruses that cause COVID-19, bird flu or swine flu into a chamber with the mask.</p>



<p>The sensor could detect just a fraction of a microliter of these proteins — a cough might contain 10 to 80 times as much. Once a pathogen was detected, the sensor-mask combo sent a signal to the researchers informing them of the virus’s presence. Ultimately, the researchers plan for such signals to be sent to a wearer’s phone or other devices. By combining this technology with more conventional testing, the team says, health care providers and public health officials might be able to better contain future pandemics.</p>

The paper has led many to take a more critical eye to published research, leading to a wave of high-profile retractions and several major studies warning of a <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/533452a">reproducibility</a><u> </u>crisis in science. So great is this concern that it has moved out of the academic sphere with governments and regulators taking an interest, such as the 2021 call from the <a href="https://committees.parliament.uk/call-for-evidence/562">UK House of Commons Science and Technology Committee </a>for evidence on reproducibility and research integrity across research institutions.</p>
<p>Alongside the reproducibility crisis the meaning of the term ‘Research Integrity’ has evolved. Originally used to define a governing ethos for best practice in scientific research and the practices it encompasses, Research Integrity has become a research field in its own right spanning sociology, philosophy, statistics, science education and meta-research. <em>BMC Research Notes</em> recently closed its collection on <a href="https://www.biomedcentral.com/collections/reproducibility">Reproducibility and Research Integrity</a>, launched in collaboration with the <a href="https://www.ukrn.org/">UK Reproducibility Network</a>. The submissions reflect how this field has matured, shifting focus from identifying problems – to offering solutions.</p>

<p style="text-align: left">A popular solution to improving research integrity is to educate aspiring researchers on the importance of robust, reproducible scientific practice. <a href="https://bmcresnotes.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13104-021-05862-8#auth-Andreas_D_-Meid">Andreas Meid</a> describes a pilot lecture series created to equip their students with this understanding and gives an honest account of what worked and what did not. Dr Meid’s lectures placed focus on developing statistical skills, an approach supported by <a href="https://bmcresnotes.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13104-022-05965-w">Penny Reynolds</a>. In her commentary, she lays out her case for better statistical education for all investigators as a solution to the pervasive reproducibility issues found in translating pre-clinical research stating <em>“Properly designed and analyzed experiments are a matter of ethics as much as procedure&#8230;reducing the numbers of animals wasted in non-informative experiments and increasing overall scientific quality and value of published research.”</em></p>
<blockquote><p><em>“Properly designed and analyzed experiments are a matter of ethics as much as procedure&#8230;reducing the numbers of animals wasted in non-informative experiments and increasing overall scientific quality and value of published research.”</em></p></blockquote>
<p>Technical education alone is not enough, argue <a href="https://bmcresnotes.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13104-022-06065-5">Ilinca Ciubotariu and Gundula Bosch</a>. They highlight the importance of science-communication to ratify research quality and promote trust in researchers. In their commentary, they showcase the framework of responsible science communication taught to students at Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health. They hope fostering this ethos will promote more transparent and accountable science in the future. <a href="https://bmcresnotes.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13104-022-06098-w">Daniel Pizzolato and Kris Dierickx</a> also consider ways to stimulate responsible research practices across the hierarchies of academic institutions. They advocate turning traditional ideas of pedagogy on their head through reverse mentoring, where a junior academic shares their scientific insights with a senior colleague. Such approaches are well established across many other industries; it seems high time for academia to catch up.</p>

<p>Across the collection, many call for change at the institutional level. <a href="https://bmcresnotes.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13104-022-05999-0">Olivia Kowalczyk</a> describes how institute heads can cultivate an environment of reproducible, open research by changing funding and hiring criteria to align with such principles. Sweeping changes in how we value research are called for by Stephen Bradley. He argues that funders should stop using citations and impact factors to assess research and instead make judgements based on quality, reproducibility, and societal value. Scientific publishers must also play their part in the pursuit of better science. <a href="https://bmcresnotes.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13104-021-05875-3">Patrick Diaba-Nuhoho and Michael Amponsah-Offeh</a> call for journals to promote the publication of unexpected results and null findings to help dispel the distinctly unscientific taboo of publishing null and negative data*.</p>
<h2>Peer Review<img class="wp-image-12982 alignright" src="https://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2022/09/review-300x300.png" alt="" width="70" height="70" srcset="https://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2022/09/review-300x300.png 300w, https://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2022/09/review-150x150.png 150w, https://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2022/09/review-125x125.png 125w, https://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2022/09/review.png 512w" sizes="(max-width: 70px) 100vw, 70px" /></h2>
<p>Peer review also comes under critique. <a href="https://bmcresnotes.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13104-022-06080-6">Robert Schultz</a> ponders the potential of automated screening tools to aid manuscript assessment, hoping it might help to screen a growing influx of new submissions more quickly, allowing reviewers more time to consider the papers they receive. <a href="https://bmcresnotes.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13104-022-06016-0">Alexandru Marcoci</a> advocates a total overall to the traditional peer review system. He proposes it be treated like an expert elicitation process, applying methods from mathematics, psychology, and decision theory to mitigate biases and enhance the transparency, accuracy, and defensibility of the resulting judgment. In this way, he argues, peer review will become an intrinsically more transparent and reliable process. An ambitious initiative but perhaps it is time to think big.</p>

<p>I contacted two contributors to the collection with the question, ‘If money were no object – what one initiative would about the greatest improvement in research integrity? One wanted the methods section to be mandated as open access across all journals, believing that transparent methods can lead to better science. The other wished to begin a longitudinal study of academic supervisors and their students to identify the best means to promote reproducible science across generations of researchers. Clearly, potential solutions to the reproducibility crisis are manifold, transcending fields and institutions. In a sentiment echoed across the collection, <a href="https://bmcresnotes.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13104-021-05883-3">Andrew Stewart</a> of the UK Reproducibility Network argues that the only way to improve research integrity is to drive systematic change across the key scientific stakeholders: academic institutions, research organizations, funders, publishers, and the government. In agreement, <a href="https://bmcresnotes.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13104-022-06108-x">Natasha Drude</a> emphasizes that the research community should <em>&#8220;view initiatives that promote reproducibility not as a one-size-fits-all undertaking, but rather as an opportunity to unite stakeholders and customize drivers of cultural change.&#8221;</em></p>
<p>Overall the view of the collection seems cautiously optimistic. Now that we have established the issues of reproducibility and research integrity, perhaps we have a chance to change science for the better. An attitude well summarized in the title of Guest Editor <a href="https://bmcresnotes.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13104-022-05942-3">Marcus Munafò&#8217;s</a> article &#8211;</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><em>“The reproducibility debate is an opportunity, not a crisis”.</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My sincere thanks to my predecessor Dr. Tamara Hughes for instigating this collection and to Professor. Marcus Munafò for putting it together.</p>
<p>*I feel I must note that <em>BMC Research Notes</em> welcomes submissions presenting null and negative results.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/pahrump-poolfish-desert-isolation-social-cues-fish-fear">After eons of isolation, these desert fish flub social cues</a></h4>

              
                <p>Getting out into society after a long isolation gets awkward. Ask the Pahrump poolfish, loners in a desert for some 10,000 years.</p>



<p>This hold-in-your-hand-size fish (<em>Empetrichthys latos</em>) has a chubby, torpedo shape and a mouth that looks as if it’s almost smiling. Until the 1950s, this species had three forms, each evolving in its own spring. Now only one survives, which developed in a spring-fed oasis in the Mojave Desert’s Pahrump Valley, about an hour’s drive west of Las Vegas.<br><br><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/devils-hole-pupfish-may-not-have-been-so-isolated-so-long">Fish in a desert are not that weird</a> when you take the long view (<em>SN: 1/26/16</em>). In a former life, some desert valleys were ancient lakes. As the region’s lakes dried up, fish got stuck in the remaining puddles. Various stranded species over time adapted to quirks of their private microlakes, and a desert-fish version of the Galapagos Islands’ diverse finches arose.</p>





<p>“We like to say that Darwin, if he had a different travel agent, could have come to the same conclusions just from the desert,” says evolutionary biologist Craig Stockwell of North Dakota State University in Fargo.<br><br>The desert “island” where <em>E. latos</em> evolved was Manse Spring on a private ranch. From a distance, the spring looked “just like a little clump of trees,” remembers ecologist Shawn Goodchild, who is now based in Lake Park, Minn. The spot of desert greenery surrounded the Pahrump poolfish’s entire native range, about the length of an Olympic swimming pool.</p>



<p>By the 1960s, biologists feared the fish were doomed. The spring’s flow rate had dropped some 70 percent as irrigation for farms in the desert sucked away water. And disastrous predators arrived: a kid’s discarded goldfish. Conservation managers fought back, but neither poison nor dynamite wiped out the newcomers. And then in August of 1975, Manse Spring dried up.</p>



<p>Conservation managers had moved some poolfish to other springs, but the long-isolated species just didn’t seem to get the dangers of living with other kinds of fishes. The poolfish were easily picked off by predators in their new home.</p>



<p>Lab tests of fake fish-murder scenes may help explain why. For instance, researchers tainted aquarium water with pureed fish bits. In an expected reaction, fathead minnows (<em>Pimephales promelas</em>) freaked at traces of dead minnow drifting through the water and huddled low in the tank. The Pahrump poolfish in water tainted with blender-whizzed skin of their kind just kept swimming around the upper waters as if corpse taint were no scarier than tap water. Literally. Stockwell and colleagues can say that because they ran a fear test with nonscary dechlorinated tap water. <a href="https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/abs/10.1098/rspb.2022.0752">Poolfish didn’t huddle then either</a>, the team reports in the Aug. 31 <em>Proceedings of the Royal Society B</em>.</p>



<p>Then, however, Stockwell and a colleague were musing about some rescued poolfish in cattle tanks when nearby dragonflies caught the researchers’ attention.</p>



<p>Before dragonflies mature into shimmering aerial marvels, the young prowl underwater as violent predators. In moves worthy of scary aliens in a sci-fi movie, many dragonfly nymphs can shoot their jaws out from their head to scoop up prey, including fish eggs and fish larvae. With young dragonflies prowling a pool’s bottom and plants, poolfish moving up the water column “would be a good way to reduce their risk,” Stockwell says. Testing of that idea has begun.</p>



<p>Fish that people thought were foolishly naïve may just be savvy in a different way. Especially after isolation in a desert with dragons.</p>

<p>Earlier this year I outlined three ways PLOS is working to eliminate author fees through new business models. The models we introduced in 2020 began as an experiment to systemically address the barriers publications fees pose for many researchers and prove that APCs are not the only way to support Open Access. More sustainable&ndash;and equitable&ndash;models exist and we&rsquo;re grateful to have partnered with so many institutions that are ready to flip the system.</p>



<h2><strong>Change is coming</strong></h2>



<p>Though we still have more work ahead of us and many more conversations to be had with research stakeholders around the world, I am super gratified to report that as of today, 181 institutions in 26 countries have partnered with us., that&rsquo;s up from 93 and 6, respectively from last year.</p>



<p>Here&rsquo;s a look back at the road to get here so far:</p>



<h2><strong>The new era of Open Access</strong></h2>



<p>PLOS was founded in 2001 with a mission to transform science communication. PLOS journals were some of the earliest Open Access titles in biology and medicine, and a key driver in proving all readers can and should have access to research without barriers. Today, many research <a href="https://wellcome.org/grant-funding/guidance/open-access-guidance/open-access-policy">funders</a>, institutions, and <a href="https://www.openaccess.nl/en/in-the-netherlands">governments </a>now <em>require </em>research to be made available under Open Access licensing<em> and </em>provide funds that can be applied to authors&rsquo; Open Access publication costs. But the ways in which Open Access is supported varies across different fields and <a href="https://council.science/current/blog/plan-s-and-open-access-interview-with-dominique-babini/">global regions</a>. There are gaps that leave many researchers who want to publish in Open Access journals without funding for APCs.</p>



<p>That&rsquo;s why we embarked on this journey nearly three years ago. We were the vanguard of publishers who demonstrated that Open Access publishing could be sustainable, but we only had half the equation right. In short, we weren&rsquo;t fulfilling our entire vision for an open and inclusive research ecosystem that facilitated the exchange of free and unrestricted knowledge. Anyone could read the research we published, but the cost of publishing in an Open venue was&ndash;and continues to be&ndash;a barrier for many authors.</p>



<h2><strong>Progress towards fee-free publishing</strong></h2>



<p>This year, we have signed three large consortia deals.<a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2022/03/plos-expands-footprint-in-sweden-with-a-new-publishing-agreement-with-the-bibsam-consortium/"> </a><a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2022/03/plos-expands-footprint-in-sweden-with-a-new-publishing-agreement-with-the-bibsam-consortium/">Bibsam</a>,<a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2022/02/plos-announces-new-publishing-agreement-with-the-consortium-of-swiss-academic-libraries/"> </a><a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2022/02/plos-announces-new-publishing-agreement-with-the-consortium-of-swiss-academic-libraries/">CSAL</a>, and<a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2022/02/plos-and-irel-sign-three-year-open-access-publishing-agreement/"> </a><a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2022/02/plos-and-irel-sign-three-year-open-access-publishing-agreement/">IReL</a>. They join a growing list of institutions including the Sachsen Consortia led by the Saxon State and University Library, the Big Ten Academic Alliance, the University of California system, CRL and NERL, Jisc (including University College London, Imperial College London, University of Manchester) and the Canadian Research Knowledge Network<a href="https://plos.org/resources/for-institutions/institutional-account-participants/"> </a><a href="https://plos.org/resources/for-institutions/institutional-account-participants/">among others</a></p>



<p>At PLOS we are committed to co-creating pathways to Open Access and Open Science as we carry our mission forward. A piece of that is ensuring our approach to Open Access solutions are not one-size-fits-all. It&rsquo;s the reason we don&rsquo;t have just one institutional partnership model for all of our journals, but several that cater to the needs of the journal research communities, and the bodies who financially support researchers&rsquo; work. These include<a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2022/01/open-access-doesnt-need-apcs-part-1/"> </a><a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2022/01/open-access-doesnt-need-apcs-part-1/">CAP</a>, which keeps costs low for selective journals (and was recently honored with an<a href="https://www.alpsp.org/"> ALPSP award</a>); <a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2022/02/open-access-doesnt-need-apcs-part-ii-global-equity/">&nbsp;</a><a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2022/02/open-access-doesnt-need-apcs-part-ii-global-equity/">Global Equity</a>, which reflects regional economic differences; and our <a href="https://plos.org/resources/for-institutions/flat-fee-agreements/">Flat Fee</a> model that aims to make Open Access publishing easier and more accessible for researchers.</p>



<p>The uptake of these models is incredible. Doubling the number of institutions is gratifying, but, on a personal note, I take greater pride in spreading Open Access publishing worldwide. This is great for institutions and PLOS, but even better for researchers. We are as eager as any author to see open-to-publish frameworks become the norm, just as Open Access has taken hold over the past two decades. I&rsquo;m just excited to be playing a part in making that happen. Watch this space for more updates!</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/milky-way-galaxy-nucleus-oldest-stars-protogalaxy">A protogalaxy in the Milky Way may be our galaxy’s original nucleus</a></h4>

              
                <p>The Milky Way left its “poor old heart” in and around the constellation Sagittarius, astronomers report. New data from the Gaia spacecraft reveal the full extent of what seems to be the galaxy’s original nucleus — the ancient stellar population that the rest of the Milky Way grew around — which came together more than 12.5 billion years ago.</p>



<p>“People have long speculated that such a vast population [of old stars] should exist in the center of our Milky Way, and Gaia now shows that there they are,” says astronomer Hans-Walter Rix of the Max Planck Institute for Astronomy in Heidelberg, Germany.</p>





<p>The Milky Way’s ancient heart is a round protogalaxy that spans nearly 18,000 light-years and possesses roughly <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.02722">100 million times the mass of the sun in stars</a>, or about 0.2 percent of the Milky Way’s current stellar mass, Rix and colleagues report in a study posted September 7 at arXiv.org.</p>



<p>“This study really helps to firm up our understanding of this very, very, very young stage in the Milky Way’s life,” says Vasily Belokurov, an astronomer at the University of Cambridge who was not involved in the work. “Not much is really known about this period of the Milky Way’s life,” he says. “We’ve seen glimpses of this population before,” but the new study gives “a bird’s-eye view of the whole structure.”</p>



<p>Most stars in the Milky Way’s central region abound with metals, because the stars originated in a crowded metropolis that earlier stellar generations had enriched with those metals through supernova explosions. But Rix and his colleagues wanted to find the exceptions to the rule, stars so metal-poor they must have been born well before the rest of the galaxy’s stellar denizens came along — what Rix calls “a needle-in-a-haystack exercise.”</p>



<p>His team turned to data from the Gaia spacecraft, which launched in 2013 on <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/new-asteroid-gaia-map-milky-way-galaxy-stars">a mission to chart the Milky Way</a> (<em>SN: 6/13/22</em>). The astronomers searched about 2 million stars within a broad region around the galaxy’s center, which lies in the constellation Sagittarius, looking for stars with metal-to-hydrogen ratios no more than 3 percent of the sun’s. </p>



<p>The astronomers then examined how those stars move through space, retaining only the ones that don’t dart off into the vast halo of metal-poor stars engulfing the Milky Way’s disk. The end result: a sample of 18,000 ancient stars that represents the kernel around which the entire galaxy blossomed, the researchers say. By accounting for stars obscured by dust, Rix estimates that the protogalaxy is between 50 million and 200 million times as massive as the sun.</p>



<p>“That’s the original core,” Rix says, and it harbors the Milky Way’s oldest stars, which he says probably have ages exceeding 12.5 billion years. The protogalaxy formed when several large clumps of stars and gas conglomerated long ago, before the Milky Way’s first disk — the so-called <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/milky-way-galaxy-history-timeline-evolution-disk">thick disk</a> — arose (<em>SN: 3/23/22</em>).</p>



<p>The protogalaxy is compact, which means little has disturbed it since its formation. Smaller galaxies have crashed into the Milky Way, augmenting its mass, but “we didn’t have any later mergers that deeply penetrated into the core and shook it up, because then the core would be larger now,” Rix says.</p>



<p>The new data on the protogalaxy even capture the Milky Way’s initial spin-up — its transition from an object that didn’t rotate into one that now does. The oldest stars in the proto–Milky Way barely revolve around the galaxy’s center but dive in and out of it instead, whereas slightly younger stars show more and more movement around the galactic center. “This is the Milky Way trying to become a disk galaxy,” says Belokurov, who saw <a href="https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article-abstract/514/1/689/6584853">the same spin-up</a> in research that he and a colleague reported in July.</p>



<p>Today, the Milky Way is a giant galaxy that spins rapidly — each hour our solar system speeds through 900,000 kilometers of space as we race around the galaxy’s center. But the new study shows that the Milky Way got its start as a modest protogalaxy whose stars still shine today, stars that astronomers can now scrutinize for further clues to the galaxy’s birth and early evolution.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/woodpecker-drumming-bird-brain-behavior-songbirds">Drumming woodpeckers use similar brain regions as songbirds</a></h4>

              
                <p>Songbirds get a lot of love for their dulcet tones, but drummers may start to steal some of that spotlight.</p>



<p>Woodpeckers, which don’t sing but do drum on trees, have <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.3001751">brain regions that are similar to those of songbirds</a>, researchers report September 20 in <em>PLOS Biology</em>. The finding is surprising because songbirds use these regions to <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/birds-learn-recognize-calls-mom-eggs-nest-sound-song">learn their songs</a> at an early age, yet it’s not clear if woodpeckers learn their drum beats (<em>SN: 9/16/21</em>). Whether woodpeckers do or not, the result suggests a shared evolutionary origin for both singing and drumming.</p>





<p>The ability to learn vocalizations by listening to them, just like humans do when learning to speak, is a rare trait in the animal kingdom. Vocal learners, such as songbirds, hummingbirds and parrots, have independently evolved certain clusters of nerve cells called nuclei in their forebrains that control the ability. Animals that don’t learn vocally are thought to lack these brain features.</p>



<p>While it’s commonly assumed that other birds don’t have these nuclei, “there’s thousands of birds in the world,” says Matthew Fuxjager, a biologist at Brown University in Providence, R.I. “While we say these brain regions only exist in these small groups of species, nobody’s really looked in a lot of these other taxa.”</p>



<p>Fuxjager and his colleagues examined the noggins of several birds that don’t learn vocally to check if they really did lack these brain nuclei. Using molecular probes, the team checked the bird brains for activity of a gene called <em>parvalbumin</em>, a known marker of the vocal learning nuclei. Many of the birds, including penguins and flamingos, came up short, but there was one exception — male and female woodpeckers, which had three spots in their brains with high <em>parvalbumin </em>activity.</p>



<p>Though woodpeckers don’t sing, they do perform a rapid drumming on trees and house gutters to defend their territories or find mates. This drumming is different from the drilling the birds do to find food. When the team found brain nuclei similar to songbirds in woodpeckers, Fuxjager was immediately intrigued. “I thought right away it’s probably related to drumming,” he says.</p>



<p>The researchers subjected downy woodpeckers (<em>Dryobates pubescens</em>) in the wild to audio recordings of drumming from other woodpeckers. This faux territorial invasion sparked an aggressive drumming response from the birds, which were then captured and euthanized to have their recent brain activity analyzed. Sure enough, the same regions identified by earlier lab tests had been activated in the drummers.</p>



<p>The brains of bird vocalists and drummers evolved separately, but the similarity of the analyzed regions hints at a common origin. “It suggests that there are common themes about how you develop these complex behaviors,” says Bradley Colquitt, a biologist at the University of California, Santa Cruz who was not involved in the study. The neural circuitry formed by these nuclei most likely developed from an ancestral circuit controlling movement, Colquitt says.</p>



<p>“Birdsong is basically the brain controlling muscles in a vocal organ called the syrinx,” Fuxjager says. These sophisticated movements are not unlike the swift head-and-neck motions involved in drumming.</p>



<p>Whether drumming is learned like birdsong remains an open question that the team is now exploring. Future work will also look at how woodpeckers’ brains are wired, how these nuclei control drumming and how the brain regions’ role in drumming evolved across woodpecker species, Fuxjager says.</p>



<p>This new study “uncovers another species that we can add to our comparative efforts” to better understand how complex behaviors evolve, Colquitt says. “It is a preview into potentially exciting evolutionary neurobiology.” Now that woodpeckers have joined the band of important musical birds, it looks like the drummers may soon get their chance to shine.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/fossil-earliest-gibbon-asia-evolution">Fossil finds put gibbons in Asia as early as 8 million years ago</a></h4>

              
                <p>Small-bodied, long-armed apes called gibbons swing rapidly through the trees, far outpacing scientists’ attempts to decipher these creatures’ evolutionary story.</p>



<p>Now, a <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jhevol.2022.103251">partial upper jaw and seven isolated teeth</a> found near a southwestern Chinese village have added bite to a suggestion that the earliest known gibbons hung out there about 7 million to 8 million years ago, researchers report in the October <em>Journal of Human Evolution</em>.</p>



<p>Those fossils, as well as 14 teeth previously found at the same site and a nearby site, belong to an ancient hylobatid species called <em>Yuanmoupithecus xiaoyuan</em>, say paleoanthropologist Xueping Ji of the Kunming Natural History Museum of Zoology in China and colleagues. Hylobatids, a family of apes that includes about 20 species of living gibbons and a black-furred gibbon called the siamang, inhabit tropical forests from northeastern India to Indonesia.</p>





<p>Ji’s group has presumed that <em>Y. xiaoyuan </em>was an ancient gibbon since introducing the species in a 2006 Chinese publication. But additional fossils were needed to check that suspicion.</p>



<p>The newly discovered upper jaw piece — found by a local villager and given to Ji during fieldwork around a decade ago — contains four teeth, including a partly erupted molar that helped researchers identify it as the remains of an infant that died before reaching age 2.</p>



<p>Comparisons with modern apes and fossils of ancient primates peg <em>Y. xiaoyuan </em>as the oldest known gibbon and cast doubt on <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/ancient-primates-apes-gibbon-tooth">a two-year-old report that a roughly 13-million-year-old molar tooth found in northern India</a> came from a hylobatid, the team says (<em>SN: 9/8/20</em>). The fossil found in India, assigned to a species dubbed <em>Kapi ragnagarensis</em>, represents an extinct group of South Asian primates that were not closely related to present-day apes, the scientists say.</p>



<p>Prior DNA analyses of living primates suggested that hylobatids diverged from other apes in Africa between 22 million and 17 million years ago. But it’s a mystery when gibbon ancestors arrived in Eurasia, says paleoanthropologist and study coauthor Terry Harrison of New York University. A gap in the fossil record of about 10 million years exists between the estimated time when hylobatids emerged in or near Africa and evidence of <em>Y. xiaoyuan </em>in Asia.</p>



<p>Genetic evidence also indicates that <a href="https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-1-4939-5614-2_4">gibbon species today shared a common ancestor around 8 million years ago</a>, when <em>Y. xiaoyuan </em>was alive. “It could be that [<em>Y. xiaoyuan</em>] is the ancestor of all later gibbons,” Harrison says. If not, <em>Y. xiaoyuan </em>was closely related to a modern gibbon ancestor, he suspects.</p>



<p>Bumps and depressions on chewing surfaces and other tooth and jaw features of <em>Y. xiaoyuan </em>look much like those of living gibbons, Ji’s team says. Some traits of the fossil species were precursors of slightly different traits in modern gibbons, the researchers suggest.</p>



<p>Based on molar sizes, they estimate that <em>Y. xiaoyuan </em>weighed about six kilograms, similar to gibbons today. Molar structure indicates that <em>Y. xiaoyuan </em>focused on eating fruits, like most gibbon species today, Harrison says.</p>



<p>Ji’s group “makes a very good case that [<em>Y. xiaoyuan</em>] is a hylobatid,” says paleoanthropologist David Alba of Institut Català de Paleontologia Miquel Crusafont in Barcelona.</p>



<p>But the evolutionary status of <em>K. ragnagarensis</em> remains unsettled because only a single tooth from that species has been found, says Alba, who did not participate in the new study.</p>

                <p>You never know how a discovery may affect future research&mdash;and as much as they try to anticipate the contribution or future application of a paper, neither do editors.</p>



<p>When journals only focus on significance of advance and priority of discovery, valuable information is excluded from the scientific record. Rigorous research that adds supporting evidence, re-examines and broadens our understanding leads to a stronger foundation of knowledge. But without the right ways to share it, many important insights could remain hidden from public view, buried in filing drawers and hard drives.&nbsp;</p>



<p>At PLOS, we&rsquo;re committed to helping researchers share more of their science&mdash;including contributions that might otherwise be excluded from the scientific record. We use journal policy, specialized articles types, and unique editorial selection criteria to help ensure that important advances receive the respect and attention they deserve. Here&rsquo;s how:</p>



<h2>1. <strong>The PLOS-wide Complementary Research (or &ldquo;Scooping&rdquo;) Policy</strong></h2>



<p>Sometimes, two research groups independently achieve similar results around the same time. When that happens, it can be difficult for the second group to publish their work, because it may no longer meet the novelty requirements for selective journals.</p>



<p>At PLOS, we see complementary findings as a positive, reinforcing the validity of both studies. That&rsquo;s why all of our journals&mdash;even the most selective&mdash;offer scooping protection to ensure that complementary results will not be rejected for novelty within six months of a similar preprint or publication by another group.</p>

</p><h2 id="preregistration">2. Registered Reports and Preregistered Research Articles</h2>



<p>Preregistration is the practice of formally depositing a study design in a repository and submitting it for peer review at a journal prior to conducting experiments, data collection or analysis. Evaluating study designs supports a strong methodological approach, increases the credibility and reproducibility of results, and helps address publication bias. Accepted study design protocols receive a provisional acceptance for the future research article reporting the results&mdash;so researchers can proceed with the study knowing that the work <em>will </em>be publishable, no matter the outcome. Preregistration can be especially beneficial for Early Career Researchers, and anyone conducting high risk/high reward research. PLOS offers two options for researchers seeking to preregister their work: <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/s/what-we-publish#loc-registered-reports">Registered Reports</a> (<em>PLOS ONE</em>) and <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/s/what-we-publish#loc-preregistered-research-articles">Preregistered Research Articles</a> (<em>PLOS Biology</em>).&nbsp;</p>

</p><h2 id="negative-null">3. Incremental advances, negative, and null results</h2>



<p>With all the pressure to publish exciting and impactful new results, incremental advances, negative and null outcomes can get left behind&mdash;and left out of the scientific record. Over the long term, this creates knowledge gaps in the literature that can undermine credibility, slow progress, and waste resources.</p>



<p>Small advances, negative outcomes, and inconclusive results <em>do </em>matter. Seemingly minor findings can have major impacts down the line. Small discoveries can plant the seeds for future investigations. In demonstrating what doesn&rsquo;t work, negative and null results can point the way toward alternative solutions which may prove more effective&mdash;not to mention saving other research groups time and resources.</p>



<p>All PLOS journals will consider meaningful negative and null outcomes if the research question they answer is sufficiently relevant to the field&mdash;but we also publish several journals that make incremental, negative and null results essential to their mission and editorial vision: <em>PLOS ONE</em>, <em>PLOS Global Public Health</em>, <em>PLOS Climate</em>, and <em>PLOS Water</em>. <em>&nbsp;</em>Each of these journals is built on the editorial philosophy that all rigorous, well-conducted research has value, and should be preserved as a part of the permanent scientific record&mdash;including replication studies, as well as negative, and inconclusive results.</p>

<h2>4. That hard-to-place research article</h2>



<p>Interdisciplinary research and studies from emerging fields can be difficult to place in many field-specific journals. Small or specialized editorial boards may lack the expertise necessary to evaluate the work from different angles, scope may rule some excellent research out if it is perceived to be on the edge of the field.&nbsp;<em>PLOS ONE</em> ensures this research finds a home and is discoverable to readers everywhere. Because of the journal&rsquo;s inclusive scope, commitment to rigor instead of novelty or impact, and our broad network of editorial board members with expertise in more than 200 disciplines, all research in the sciences and related disciplines can be evaluated and shared with readers around the world.</p>

<h2>Bonus: Ensuring research reaches the broadest audience</h2>



<p>Even when published, research may remain out of view from audiences who need it. Broadly, Open Access licensing, article promotion and indexing all help ensure published (or preprinted!) research is available to as many people as possible. But where and how research is shared still shapes who sees it.</p>



<p>Many journals are built with a specific community in mind, catering to researchers in a specific field as both authors and readers eager to stay up-to-date on progress from their peers or dive deeper into discoveries and techniques that directly impact their own research. These journals are helpful spaces for building networks and sparking discussions that accelerate progress in a given field&mdash;but some topics are too big to tackle from within just one discipline or have far-reaching implications beyond a single field of study.</p>



<p>Multidisciplinary journals bring different viewpoints, skillsets and analytical approaches together, encouraging collaboration and conversation amongst research groups and decision-makers working to solve similar challenges. Many of our journals consider multi- or inter- disciplinary research in order to present a robust view of the field and it is a centerpiece of the mission for <em>PLOS Climate, PLOS Global Public Health, </em>and <em>PLOS Water.</em> These journals bridge gaps between related fields, consider social, economic, and behavioral factors that affect these issues, and bring regional perspectives together to address global challenges. By bringing together this work in a single venue, readers get a more holistic view of the topics and challenges in these areas, and how they might inform each other to foster more creative solutions, robust decision-making, or deepen existing knowledge.</p>



<h3>What other aspects of scientific research should be uncovered and preserved?</h3>



<p>Are there more ways PLOS could help to facilitate the sharing of high quality research that would ordinarily remain hidden? Share your thoughts in the comments.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/red-fox-fish-food-first-video-spain">Video shows the first fox known to fish for food</a></h4>

              
                <p>The fox froze. Inches from his paws, frenzied, spawning carp writhed in the shallow water along a reservoir’s shore. In a sudden flash of movement, the fox dove nose-first into the water, emerging with a large carp wriggling in his mouth.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In March 2016, two researchers in Spain watched as a male red fox (<em>Vulpes vulpes</em>) <a href="https://esajournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ecy.3814?utm_source=google&amp;utm_medium=paidsearch&amp;utm_campaign=R3MR425&amp;utm_content=LifeSciences">stalked and caught 10 carp over a couple of hours</a>. The event, described in a study published August 18 in <em>Ecology</em>, seems to be the first recorded instance of a fox fishing, the researchers say. The discovery makes red foxes just the second type of canid — the group that includes wolves and dogs — known to hunt fish.</p>





<p>“Seeing the fox hunting carp one after another was incredible,” says ecologist Jorge Tobajas of the University of Córdoba. “We have been studying this species for years, but we never expected something like this.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Tobajas and his colleague Francisco Díaz-Ruiz of the University of Málaga stumbled across the fishing fox while surveying a site for a different project. The fox first caught their attention because it didn’t immediately flee when it spotted the researchers. Seizing the opportunity, Tobajas and Díaz-Ruiz decided to hide nearby and see what the fox was up to.</p>



<p>Their curiosity turned into excitement after the fox caught its first fish. “The most surprising thing was to see how the fox hunted many carp without making any mistakes,” Tobajas says. “This made us realize that it was surely not the first time he had done it.”</p>

</div><figcaption>In March 2016, a male red fox (<em>Vulpes vulpes</em>) in Spain was spotted grabbing carp during spring spawning season. The event seems to be the first recorded instance of a fox fishing. Foxes and wolves are now the only canids known to fish.</figcaption></figure>



<p>Instead of immediately guzzling down all of the fish, the fox hid most of its catch and appeared to share at least one fish with a female fox, possibly its mate.</p>



<p>Fish remains have been spotted in the scat of foxes before. But scientists weren’t sure whether foxes had caught the fish themselves or were simply scavenging dead fish. This research confirms that some foxes fish for their food, says Thomas Gable, a wildlife ecologist at the University of Minnesota in Minneapolis who wasn’t involved in the research.</p>



<p>“I would be shocked if this was the only fox to have learned how to fish,” Gable says.</p>



<p>Wolves living on the Pacific coast of North America and in Minnesota <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/wolves-regurgitate-blueberries-pups-diet">are the only other canids known to fish</a> (<em>SN: 2/11/20</em>). The fact that two canid species living on separate continents both fish opens the possibility that the behavior might be more common than previously thought, Gable says.</p>



<p>For Tobajas, the fishing fox is an example of how much scientists still don’t know about the natural world, even for species that live fairly close with humans. “The red fox is a very common species and is in many cases a bit hated,” he says. Foxes sometimes attack pets or livestock and are considered a pest in many places. But “observations like this show us that it a fascinating and very intelligent animal.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/quantum-sensor-sunlight-environment-magnetic-field">This environmentally friendly quantum sensor runs on sunlight</a></h4>

              
                <p>Quantum tech is going green.</p>



<p>A new take on highly sensitive magnetic field sensors ditches the power-hungry lasers that previous devices have relied on to make their measurements and replaces them with sunlight. Lasers can gobble 100 watts or so of power — like keeping a bright lightbulb burning. The innovation potentially untethers quantum sensors from that energy need. The result is an <a href="https://journals.aps.org/prxenergy/accepted/9607cK25D4a18803a7914f5164e2f133eb90a6171">environmentally friendly prototype</a> on the forefront of technology, researchers report in an upcoming issue of <em>Physical Review X Energy</em>.</p>





<p>The big twist is in <em>how</em> the device uses sunlight. It doesn’t use solar cells to convert light into electricity. Instead, the sunlight does the job of the laser’s light, says Jiangfeng Du, a physicist at the University of Science and Technology of China in Hefei.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>



<p>Quantum magnetometers often include a powerful green laser to measure magnetic fields. The laser shines on a <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/diamond-detectors">diamond that contains atomic defects</a> (<em>SN: 2/26/08</em>). The defects result when nitrogen atoms replace some of the carbon atoms that pure diamonds are made of. The green laser causes the nitrogen defects to fluoresce, emitting red light with an intensity that depends on the strength of the surrounding magnetic fields.</p>



<p>The new quantum sensor needs green light too. There’s plenty of that in sunlight, as seen in the green wavelengths reflected from tree leaves and grass. To collect enough of it to run their magnetometer, Du and colleagues replaced the laser with a lens 15 centimeters across to gather sunlight. They then filtered the light to remove all colors but green and focused it on a diamond with nitrogen atom defects. The result is red fluorescence that reveals magnetic field strengths just as laser-equipped magnetometers do.</p>

That green light provides an environmentally friendly alternative to the light created by power-hungry lasers that conventional quantum devices rely on.</span><span class="credit wp-credit-3117242">Yunbin Zhu/University of Science and Technology of China</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>Changing energy from one type to another, as happens <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/perovskites-power-solar-industry">when solar cells collect light and produce electricity</a>, is an inherently inefficient process (<em>SN: 7/26/17</em>). The researchers claim that avoiding the conversion of sunlight to electricity to run lasers makes their approach three times more efficient than would be possible with solar cells powering lasers.</p>



<p>“I’ve never seen any other reports that connect solar research to quantum technologies,” says Yen-Hung Lin, a physicist at the University of Oxford who was not involved with the study. “It might well ignite a spark of interest in this unexplored direction, and we could see more interdisciplinary research in the field of energy.”</p>



<p>Quantum devices sensitive to other things, like electric fields or pressure, could also benefit from the sunlight-driven approach, the researchers say. In particular, space-based quantum technology might use the intense sunlight available outside Earth’s atmosphere to provide light tailored for quantum sensors. The remaining light, in wavelengths that the quantum sensors don’t use, could be relegated to solar cells that power electronics to process the quantum signals.</p>



<p>The sunlight-driven magnetometer is just a first step in the melding of quantum and environmentally sustainable technology. “In the current state, this device is primarily for developmental purposes,” Du says. “We expect that the devices will be used for practical purposes. But there [is] lots of work to be done.”<a href="https://sites.google.com/site/snstaffresources/resources/citation-styles"></a></p>
