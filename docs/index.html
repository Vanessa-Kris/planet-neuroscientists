              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/tonga-volcano-eruption-history-south-pacific">What the Tonga volcano’s past tells us about what to expect next</a></h4>

              
                <p>On January 15, an underwater volcano in the island nation of Tonga erupted with the explosive force of a nuclear bomb, and it may not be done just yet.</p>



<p>The eruption of Hunga-Tonga-Hunga-Ha&#8217;apai volcano in the South Pacific launched a towering, mushroom-shaped cloud of ash and dust at least 20 kilometers into the atmosphere — and <a href="https://twitter.com/simon_sat/status/1483129968393695239">possibly as high as 39 kilometers</a> by one estimate. The blast sent <a href="https://twitter.com/NiwaWeather/status/1482275541353140224">shock waves that are still rippling</a> through the atmosphere a week later.</p>



<p>Images show ash caked on Tonga islands, coating buildings, clinging to crops and probably contaminating water supplies. The power of the explosion also triggered a rare volcanic tsunami that raced across the ocean, inundating the densely populated island of Tongatapu 65 kilometers away from the eruption, sending residents fleeing to higher ground. At least three people have died due to the eruption and tsunami.</p>



<p>The volcano may now return to a period of dormancy after releasing its fury. But it also might not. Researchers who have studied Hunga-Tonga-Hunga-Ha&#8217;apai’s eruptive history, recorded in layers of hardened ash and fragments of volcanic pumice, say that this volcano has tended to erupt explosively every thousand years or so — and not just once, but in multiple pulses.</p>



<p>Whether that will happen this time, and if so, when, is very difficult to say at this point, says Shane Cronin, a volcanologist at the University of Auckland in New Zealand. He has been working with colleagues to gather information on the volcano to help with relief efforts and predict what might come next.</p>

<p>“Time will tell, and the next few days may tell us a lot,” he says.</p>



<p>Tonga has no active seismometers — and communications from the island nation remain largely incapacitated by ashfall and flooding. But with the help of satellite images, Cronin and others are keeping close watch over the region, hunting for changes to the volcano’s shape or height or other indicators that may signal that magma might be on the move again.</p>





<p>For now, the volcano’s violent past may offer some clues to its future. Even before the recent eruption, most of the volcano, including the caldera, or central crater, was submerged; now it’s sunk even farther. But at the crater’s fringe lie two small, uninhabited islands — Hunga-Tonga and Hunga-Ha’apai. They once rose a hundred meters or so above the water. That’s where, after a small 2014–2015 eruption, a new volcanic cone appeared, essentially bridging the two islands. That provided a landing spot for Cronin and his colleagues, who journeyed there in 2015 and <a href="https://doi.org/10.1029/2017EO076589">discovered Hunga-Tonga-Hunga-Ha&#8217;apai‘s hidden history</a>.</p>



<p>Cronin talked with <em>Science News </em>about the recent eruption, why its tsunami was so unusual and his and his colleagues&#8217; efforts to piece together the volcano’s history. This interview has been edited for brevity and clarity.</p>



<p><strong><em>SN: </em>What’s happening in the eruption’s aftermath? Satellite images show a cloud of sulfur dioxide from the volcano over the Pacific.</strong></p>



<p><strong>Cronin:</strong> Yes, the plume is stretched out really long now to the northwest. It’s quite high in the atmosphere, over 25 kilometers in elevation. So it will stay there for a little while, not long enough to make a long-term climate impact but certainly enough to generate some acid rain [in the region].</p>



<p><strong><em>SN:</em></strong><em> </em><strong>What are some of the ashfall hazards?</strong><em></em></p>



<p><strong>Cronin:</strong> [Satellite photos suggest many Tonga] islands are gray and covered in ash. It’s very hard to tell from the air, but it looks in the range of a few centimeters thick. That means the risk of buildings collapsing is low. The biggest problem is crops, because the ash sticks to the plants and they may die.</p>

<p>A secondary problem is drinking water: The ash has salts in it that dissolve in water and turn it acidic. Around 50 percent of Tongans have their water from roof-fed rainwater supplies. The taste and odor are unpleasant, and it could cause stomach upsets, but it’s not poisonous in that it doesn’t have high concentrations of heavy metals.</p>



<p><strong><em>SN:</em></strong><em> </em><strong>A lot of the land you mapped in 2015 is now submerged. What’s it like to know that this place is just gone?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Cronin:</strong> It’s a bit sad. It’s remarkable how changeable these volcanic landscapes are. This one hasn’t maybe sunk in yet because I’ve been so busy in the aftermath of it. We’re still looking at all of the photos coming through of the changes. It seems that the whole top of the volcano actually just dropped vertically, by at least 10 meters; just the tips of [Hunga-Tonga and Hunga-Ha’apai] islands are now above sea level.</p>



<p><strong><em>SN:</em></strong><em> </em><strong>Was there a large magma chamber under the caldera that emptied and collapsed, dropping everything down?</strong><em></em></p>



<p><strong>Cronin:</strong> That would be my interpretation. Some other volcanologists are saying there’s no evidence yet, and that the [observed volume of erupted magma] was quite small. But the explosion originated maybe 250 meters below sea level. You have material exploding upward, but also a lot that probably went sideways.</p>



<p><strong><em>SN:</em></strong><em> </em><strong>When did you realize the volcano might be bigger and more explosive than suggested by the 2014-2015 eruption?</strong><em></em></p>



<p><strong>Cronin:</strong> &nbsp;Well, we knew that there was a bigger volcano [than just the cone] there, we just didn’t know what the shape of it was. We took with us a multibeam seafloor mapping system, thinking we’d try to map the submarine shape of the new cone.</p>



<p>As we were driving [offshore] with the multibeam, we started seeing a whole lot of other little submarine volcanic cones. It was like, “Wow, look at that!” And then we realized that they were all within a deep basin, about 150 meters deep. The little cones were actually all inside one large submerged caldera, about 6 kilometers across.</p>

<p>[Meanwhile] I spent a lot of time looking at a series of [volcanic] deposits on Hunga-Tonga and Hunga-Ha’apai. It was clear they were produced by much more violent processes [than what had formed the new cone. These deposits] were ignimbrite: They were hot, welded together and contained charcoal, which we used to get the year of the event: 1100. Then, below a layer of soil, there was another series of very similar deposits [dating to about the year 200]. &nbsp;</p>



<p><strong><em>SN:</em></strong><em> </em><strong>So basically you realized that every thousand years or so, there was a series of powerful eruptions?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Cronin:</strong> Yes. And probably there were two or three more sets of deposits underneath that array.</p>



<p><strong><em>SN:</em></strong><em> </em><strong>Ocean island volcanoes </strong><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/blog/science-the-public/no-kilauea-wont-cause-mass-destruction-krakatoa"><strong>like Kilauea </strong></a><strong>aren’t usually very explosive (</strong><strong><em>SN: 5/16/18</em></strong><strong>); their basalt magma tends to be less thick and gassy. So what happened here?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Cronin:</strong> We don’t know the composition of this eruption, because we don’t have any sample material yet. But everything else we’ve sampled from this volcano is actually quite boring — it’s all basalt, more or less the same compositions during the little magma leaks as during the major explosive events.</p>



<p>The main difference in the major explosive events is that the magma maybe had a little bit more residence time [within the magma chamber], allowing it to accumulate more gas. [As magma rises toward the surface and the pressure decreases, gases in it expand, giving magma its potentially explosive power.]</p>



<p>When there’s plenty of water around and the gassy magma blasts quickly into the ocean, you can also have some explosive blasts. You’ve got the interaction of fragmenting hot magma with cold seawater, and you flash the seawater into steam, adding a lot of energy to the explosion. We call that a phreatomagmatic eruption.</p>



<p><strong><em>SN:</em></strong><em> </em><strong>It’s pretty unusual for a volcano to produce a tsunami, too, isn’t it?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Cronin:</strong> Yes, there’s been a lot of discussion about how the tsunami was so energetic. It’s hard to create enough energy with volcanoes [because they don’t tend to be big enough and shift enough water to create a powerful tsunami, unlike earthquakes].</p>



<p>Even if you consider the whole 6-kilometer diameter of the underwater crater, and the whole thing dropping by 10 or even 100 meters, that’s still a very small area. It’s a relatively small volume of water that gets displaced to generate a tsunami.</p>



<p>I’ve been thinking about this the last few days, to try to explain the energy transfer from volcano to waves. During an explosive eruption, you have processes that blast material upward, producing the main eruption column. But when we are close to sea level, or maybe even submarine, you also end up generating very dense eruption columns underwater that can collapse and travel out laterally.</p>



<p>So you can end up with these laterally directed currents made up of a mix of hot rock particles, air and water droplets flowing down the flanks of the volcano. And we’ll never see them because they’re underneath the waves. [These flows] are potentially a mechanism for a lot more extra volume, and for a lot of lateral energy, that could create tsunami events. They’re very unusual tsunamis in that respect.</p>



<p><strong><em>SN:</em></strong><em> </em><strong>The volcano had a few smaller eruptions on December 30 and January 13. Were you bracing for more?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Cronin:</strong> I was watching it like a hawk, for sure. After the 30th of December event, we scrambled around to get images to try and figure out what was happening.</p>



<p>The 2014–2015 eruption had some small surges at the [volcano’s] base, some jets, spectacular to look at but mainly locally important. The December 30 and January 13 events were more vertical, quite decent plumes, a step up in terms of explosive energy, and obviously the pressure was rising, and by the 15th, that pent-up, gas-rich magma was ready to erupt.</p>



<p><strong><em>SN:</em></strong><em> </em><strong>So the big question: What can we expect next?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Cronin:</strong> We don’t have a lot to go on. There are no seismographs anywhere near this volcano, or in Tonga, which is a real problem. All the observations up to now were taken from a boat, or these aerial images. It’s hard to do any prediction.</p>



<p>So [volcanologists] have come up with three possible scenarios, small, medium and large, based on the geologic background. The large scenario is that there’s this pent-up, gas-charged magma that has erupted, and it caused a very large explosion, and has changed the shape of the upper part of the volcano. So, if new magma rapidly arrives to take its place and comes into that really unstable edifice, it may start to create further explosive eruptions, but also potential flank collapses [possibly causing more tsunamis].</p>



<p>The medium scenario is that there’s new magma, but [any] new cracks in the volcano’s flanks mean the magma could degas [becoming less likely to explode] before it erupts. There will still be magma-water interaction, though, and chances of a small eruption plume and maybe a small tsunami.</p>



<p>The small scenario is that there’s a little bit of residual activity, some small water-magma events, and then everything quiets down. Right now, we aren’t seeing a great deal of disturbance or discoloration in the water from aerial images, which seems to indicate that things are quieting down.</p>



<p>Time will tell now, and we’ll be watching.</p>

                <p>A brilliant blast from a galaxy 2 billion light-years away is the brightest cosmic “Cow” found yet. It’s the fifth known object in this new class of exploding stars and their long-glowing remnants, and it’s giving astronomers even more hints of what powers these mysterious blasts.</p>



<p>These Cow-like events, named for the <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/cosmic-cow-may-be-strange-supernova">first such object discovered</a> in 2018 — which had the unique identifier name of AT2018cow — are a subclass of supernova explosions, making up only 0.1 percent of such cosmic blasts (<em>SN: 6/21/19</em>). They brighten quickly, glow brilliantly in ultraviolet and blue light and continue to show up for months in higher-energy X-rays and lower-energy radio waves.</p>



<p>X-rays from the newest discovery, dubbed AT2020mrf, <a href="https://aas.org/sites/default/files/2022-01/AAS239_Mon2_YuhanYao.pdf">glowed 20 times as bright as the original Cow</a> a month after the blast, Caltech astronomer Yuhan Yao reported January 10 at a virtual news conference held by the American Astronomical Society. And even one year after this new object’s discovery, its X-rays were 200 times as bright as those from the original Cow. Yao and colleagues also reported <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.00751">the results in a paper</a> submitted December 1 at arXiv.org.</p>



<p>Unraveling all that took a bit of time. The Zwicky Transient Facility at Caltech’s Palomar Observatory near San Diego, Calif., initially noted a bright new burst of light June 12, 2020, but astronomers didn’t realize what it was at the time.</p>





<p>Then in April 2021, researchers with the Spektrum-Roentgen-Gamma (SRG) space telescope, which studies X-ray light, alerted Yao and her colleagues to an interesting signal in SRG data from July 21–24, 2020, at the same spot in the sky. “I almost immediately realized that this might be another Cow-like event,” says Yao. The astronomers sprang to action and looked at that location with multiple other observatories in different kinds of light.</p>

<h4>Bright spot</h4>



<p>The brightest Cow-like supernova blast yet seen, AT2020mrf, was not visible (empty circle) in January 2020 in X-rays captured by the Spektrum-Roentgen-Gamma space telescope. But in July, it was hard to miss.</p>

<p>One of those observatories was the space-based Chandra X-ray Observatory, the world’s most powerful X-ray telescope. In June 2021, a year after the original supernova blast, it captured X-rays from the same location. The source’s signal “was 10 times brighter than what I expected,” says Yao, and 200 times as bright as the original Cow was a year post-explosion.</p>



<p>Even more exciting was that the strengths of both the Chandra X-ray detection and the original SRG X-ray observations also changed within hours to days. That flaring characteristic, it turns out, can tell astronomers a lot.</p>



<p>“X-rays give us information of what’s happening at the heart of these events,” says MIT astrophysicist DJ Pasham, who has studied the original Cow but was not part of this new study. “The duration of the flare gives you a sense of how compact or how big the object is.” &nbsp;</p>



<p>A compact object like an actively eating black hole or a rapidly spinning and highly magnetic neutron star would create the strong and variable X-ray signals that were seen, Yao says. These were the two most probable <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/cow-neutron-star-black-hole">leftover remnants of the original cosmic Cow</a> as well, but the AT2020mrf observations provide even greater certainty (<em>SN: 12/13/21</em>).</p>



<p>Further observations and catching these objects earlier in the act with multiple types of light will help researchers learn more about this new class of supernovas and what type of star eventually explodes as a Cow.</p>

                <p><em>By</em> <a href="https://twitter.com/mattbwarren">Matthew Warren</a></p>



<p>Belief in conspiracy theories has been linked to various factors, including <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2021/02/23/belief-in-conspiracy-theories-is-associated-with-lower-levels-of-critical-thinking/">low levels of critical thinking</a>, a <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2017/09/01/believing-widely-doubted-conspiracy-theories-makes-some-people-feel-special/">need to feel special</a>, and even a <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2021/08/20/conspiracy-theories-are-more-entertaining-than-the-truth-and-this-helps-explain-why-people-believe-them/">yearning for excitement and thrills</a>. But how does political ideology come into it? Some studies suggest that there is a straightforward association, in which people with more extreme right-wing views are more prone to conspiracy theories. But other work has found a “U-shaped” relationship, where conspiratorial thinking is more common among people on the extremes of both the right <em>and </em>left compared to those with more moderate views.</p>



<p>The latter finding has tended to come from research into a small group of relatively prosperous nations, note the authors of a <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41562-021-01258-7">new study</a> in <em>Nature Human Behaviour</em>. But now, looking at data from more than 100,000 people across 26 countries, the team finds further evidence that conspiracy theories are more common among the far left as well as the right, and provides some suggestions as to why this is the case.</p>



<span id="more-45115"></span>



<p>Across two studies, Roland Imhoff from Johannes Gutenberg University Mainz and colleagues recruited 104,253 participants from European nations, as well as Brazil, Israel and Turkey. Each participant rated their political orientation on a single scale from extreme left to extreme right, and also indicated what party they would vote for (or had voted for in the previous election). They also completed the Conspiracy Mentality Questionnaire, which taps into endorsement of conspiracy theories with questions like “I think that there are secret organizations that greatly influence political decisions”.</p>



<p>The team did find some evidence, in the first study at least, that there was an overall linear relationship between political orientation and having a conspiracy mentality, with people on the extreme right more likely to endorse conspiracy theories. But this effect wasn’t consistent on a country-by-country basis: in some countries there was no relationship, and in others it was actually people on the extreme <em>left</em> that endorsed conspiracy theories more.</p>



<p>Instead, the researchers found that the data better fit a U-shaped relationship, where belief in conspiracy theories rose both for extreme right-wing and extreme left-wing participants. This relationship proved significant for both studies, and was more consistent across individual countries.</p>



<p>Why would people on the fringes of the political spectrum be more likely to endorse conspiracy theories? One possibility is that these people don’t see their political views reflected in government — after all, extreme political groups do not make it into government as often as more moderate parties — and turn to conspiracy theories to try and make sense of this apparent lack of political control.</p>



<p>To test this theory, the researchers looked at whether conspiracy beliefs differed between those who supported a party in government and those who supported a party that wasn’t in power. They found that participants whose preferred party was not in power did indeed show stronger endorsement of conspiracy theories. But even after controlling for this, the researchers still found that U-shaped relationship between political ideology and conspiracy beliefs, suggesting that a lack of political control can’t be the only reason that people on the extremes endorse conspiracy theories.</p>



<p>An alternative explanation is that the extreme left and right actually share some views that are also related to conspiracism. These people often demonise the outgroup, for instance, and subscribe to authoritarian views – themes which also crop up in conspiracy beliefs. Indeed, the team found evidence that supporters of extremely left-wing parties were only prone to conspiracy beliefs when those parties were nationalistic and authoritarian, and not when they were socially liberal.</p>



<p>Overall, then, the results suggest that people are more likely to endorse conspiracy theories if they don’t see themselves represented in government — but also that subscribing to an extreme political ideology also has an effect above and beyond that of a lack of representation.  There are some limitations though. As the authors note, it could be that people who believe in conspiracy theories are drawn to fringe parties, rather than conspiracy theories developing as a reaction to a lack of power. And, perhaps unsurprisingly, the team also found evidence that political unrest within a nation and conspiratorial language from its leaders can also have a profound effect on who endorses conspiracy theories. Further work could look in more detail at how political rhetoric can give rise to conspiracy beliefs.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/rain-global-economy-drought-flash-floods">Intense drought or flash floods can shock the global economy</a></h4>

              
                <p>Extremes in rainfall — whether intense drought or flash floods — <a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-021-04283-8">can catastrophically slow the global economy</a>, researchers report in the Jan. 13 <em>Nature</em>. And those impacts are most felt by wealthy, industrialized nations, the researchers found.</p>



<p>A global analysis showed that episodes of intense drought led to the biggest shocks to economic productivity. But days with intense deluges — <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/climate-change-europe-flash-flood-rain-july">such as occurred in July 2021 in Europe</a> — also produced strong shocks to the economic system (<em>SN: 8/23/21</em>). Most surprising, though, was that agricultural economies appeared to be relatively resilient against these types of shocks, says Maximilian Kotz, an environmental economist at the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research in Germany. Instead, two other business sectors — manufacturing and services — were the most hard-hit.</p>



<p>As a result, the nations most affected by rainfall extremes weren’t those that tended to be poorer, with agriculture-dependent societies, but the wealthiest nations, whose economies are tied more heavily to manufacturing and services, such as banking, health care and entertainment.</p>



<p>It’s well established that rising temperatures can take a toll on <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/climate-change-economic-cost-united-states">economic productivity</a>, for example by contributing to days lost at work or doctors’ visits (<em>SN: 11/28/18</em>). Extreme heat also has clear impacts <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/extreme-heat-climate-change-human-behavior-aggression-equity">on human behavior</a> (<em>SN: 8/18/21</em>)<em>.</em> But what effect climate change–caused shifts in rainfall might have on the global economy hasn’t been so straightforward.</p>





<p>That’s in part because previous studies looking at a possible connection between rainfall and productivity have focused on changes in yearly precipitation, a timeframe that “is just too coarse to really describe what’s actually happening [in] the economy,” Kotz says. Such studies showed that more rain in a given year was basically beneficial, which makes sense in that having more water available is good for agriculture and other human activities, he adds. “But these findings were mainly focused on agriculturally dependent economies and poorer economies.”</p>



<p>In the new study, Kotz and his colleagues looked at three timescales — annual, monthly and daily rainfall — and examined what happened to economic output for time periods in which the rainfall deviated from average historical values. In particular, Kotz says, they introduced two new measures not considered in previous studies: the amount of rainy days that a region gets in a year and extreme daily rainfall. The team then examined these factors across 1,554 regions around the world — which included many subregions within 77 countries — from 1979 to 2019.</p>



<p>The disparity over which regions are hit hardest is “at odds with the conventional wisdom” — and with some previous studies — that agriculture is vulnerable to extreme rainfall, writes Xin-Zhong Liang, an atmospheric scientist at the University of Maryland in College Park, in <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-021-03783-x">a commentary in the same issue</a> of <em>Nature</em>. Researchers may need to incorporate other factors in future assessments, such as growth stages of crops, land drainage or irrigation, in order to really understand how these extremes affect agriculture, Liang writes.</p>



<p>“That was definitely surprising for us as well,” Kotz says. Although the study doesn’t specifically try to answer why manufacturing and services were so affected, it makes intuitive sense, he says. Flooding, for example, can damage infrastructure and disrupt transportation, effects that can then propagate along supply chains. “It’s feasible that these things might be most important in manufacturing, where infrastructure is very important, or in the services sectors, where the human experience is very much dictated by these daily aspects of weather and rainfall.”</p>



<p>Including daily and monthly rainfall extremes in this type of analysis was “an important innovation” because it revealed new economic vulnerabilities, says Tamma Carleton, an environmental economist at the University of California, Santa Barbara, who was not involved in the new work. However, Carleton says, “the findings in the paper are not yet conclusive on who is most vulnerable and why, and instead raise many important questions for future research to unpack.”</p>



<p>Extreme rainfall events, including both <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/climate-change-un-ipcc-report-humans">drought and deluge, will occur more frequently</a> as global temperatures rise, the United Nations’ Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change noted in August (<em>SN: 8/9/21</em>). The study’s findings, Kotz says, offer yet another stark warning to the industrialized, wealthy world: Human-caused climate change will have “large economic consequences.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/baby-saliva-spit-sharing-relationships-kiss-food">Babies may use saliva sharing to figure out relationships</a></h4>

              
                <p>Young children are always watching. That includes when people swap spit through actions like sharing food — helping the tots work out who is in close relationships with one another, a study suggests.</p>



<p>Typically, people are more likely to share things that can lead to an exchange of saliva, such as kisses or an ice cream cone, with family members or close friends than with an acquaintance or colleague. As a result, intimate actions that share saliva can be markers of a “thick relationship,” or people who have enduring attachments to each other, such as parents, siblings, extended family or best friends, says Ashley Thomas, a developmental psychologist at MIT.</p>



<p>Young children often <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/blog/growth-curve/your-baby-knows-who-your-real-friends-are">pick up on social cues</a> from the people around them (<em>SN: 1/30/14</em>). So to see if kids, including babies and toddlers, might use saliva sharing as a cue for intimate bonds, Thomas and colleagues turned to experiments of people engaging with puppets.</p>



<p>When shown a puppet seemingly crying in a video, children as young as about 8 months old were <a href="http://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.abn5157">more likely to look at an adult who had previously shared saliva with the puppet</a> — either directly or by sharing food — rather than another adult who hadn’t, the team reports in the Jan. 21 <em>Science</em>.</p>





<p>Researchers, of course, can’t know exactly what babies are thinking. But tracking where they look is one way to get a hint. The idea is not that young children might be expecting an adult to comfort the puppet, Thomas says. Instead, the researchers expected that the young children would look toward the person that they expect to move first when the puppet expresses distress, and that would be the person who has a closer relationship with the toy, she says.</p>



<p>For some of the experiments, the team showed 8- to 10-month-old babies or 16- to 18-month-old toddlers videos of a woman sharing an orange slice with a puppet. A second video depicted another woman and the puppet playing with a ball. During a final video that showed the puppet seemingly crying while seated between the two women, the kids’ eyes were drawn to the woman who had shared the orange slice — a sign the tots may have been expecting her to react.</p>



<p>The team saw similar results when one woman interacted with two puppets. The woman stuck her finger in her mouth and then one puppet’s mouth to share her saliva. For the other, she touched only her forehead and then the puppet’s forehead. Infants and toddlers spent more time looking at the puppet that had swapped saliva after the woman showed distress.</p>



<p>Older children ages 5 to 7 years also picked up on saliva sharing as a mark of close relationships. Kids in that age group predicted that people sharing utensils or bites of food might be family while those sharing toys or divvying up food could be either friends or family.</p>



<p>It’s unclear how the findings relate to the daily lives of young children. Future experiments could switch out actresses in the study for family members or teachers to better understand the role saliva may play in how infants and toddlers distinguish different types of relationships. Other cues, such as hugging, may also play a role, Thomas says.</p>



<p>The study also focused only on children living in the United States, and didn’t compare across cultures. Still, the findings are exciting, says Darby Saxbe, a clinical developmental psychologist and co-director of the University of Southern California Center for the Changing Family in Los Angeles. It would be interesting, she says, to figure out whether kids from groups of people that have different hygiene or eating traditions react differently in the same situations.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/fin-whale-eat-choke-baleen-oral-plug-muscle-fat">A ‘trapdoor’ made of muscle and fat helps fin whales eat without choking</a></h4>

              
                <p>Some of the world’s largest whales feed by lunging through the water with mouths wide open. Scientists have long wondered how the animals withstand the tremendous pressure of water rushing into their throats without choking and drowning.</p>



<p>A plug made of muscle and fat found at the back of fin whales’ mouths might offer a clue. The plug blocks the channel between a fin whale’s mouth and its pharynx, the entrance to the respiratory and digestive tracts. The plug appears to prevent water from rushing into the whale’s lungs and stomach while it lunges and <a href="https://www.cell.com/current-biology/fulltext/S0960-9822(21)01727-9">could explain how all lunge-feeding whale eat without choking</a>, researchers report January 20 in <em>Current Biology</em>.</p>



<p>“Think of [the plug] as a trapdoor,” says Kelsey Gil, a marine biologist at the University of British Columbia in Vancouver. “It’s always closed unless muscular activity pulls it out of the way.”</p>



<p>Gil and her team identified the plug after&nbsp;examining the pharynx of 19&nbsp;fin whales (<em>Balaenoptera physalus</em>) recovered from an Icelandic whaling station. Because fin whales <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/baleen-whales-eat-poop-more-food-ecosystem">are prodigious eaters</a> and can weigh up to 100 metric tons, the size of a midsized passenger plane, it was easier to work with just the pharynx (<em>SN: 11/3/21</em>).</p>





<p>“Even then we had to use a forklift to move the pharynx to the lab. It can weigh a few hundred pounds,” says Gil.</p>





<p>Once the samples were in the lab, she and her team manipulated different structures in the pharynx to see how they could move and looked at which direction muscle fibers ran within the whales’ throat to understand how the muscles behave when they contract.</p>



<p>When a whale gulps water, the pressure leads to the plug creating a tight seal over the whale’s pharynx. Then, with a mouth full of water and prey, a fin whale pushes the water out through its baleen plates before it swallows. The swallow reflex probably activates the muscle that pulls the plug up to the top of its throat, blocking the upper airways and letting prey slide into its digestive tract. The plug, which appears to be unique among mammals, may explain how other lunge-feeders eat without choking on water, the scientists say.</p>



<p>“The discovery of the ‘oral plug’&nbsp;answers a long-standing question about how whales can simultaneously protect their respiratory tract while opening their mouths wide to engulf prey-laden water,” says Sarah Fortune, an expert in large whales at Dalhousie University in Halifax, Nova Scotia, who was not involved in the study. It also helps us better understand the adaptations that permitted once terrestrial mammals to evolve back into sea-dwelling creatures, she says.</p>

                The Covid-19 pandemic has propelled the scientific community into a world devoid of in-person conferences. Traditional ‘legacy’ conferences, which have long been the mainstay of academic networking and crucial for catching the latest science, have been largely replaced with virtual events.

              <h4><a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2022/01/20/childrens-books-still-feature-more-male-than-female-protagonists/">Children’s books still feature more male than female protagonists</a></h4>

              
                <p><em>By </em><a href="http://emilyoliviareynolds.com/">Emily Reynolds</a></p>



<p>There are many fields in which women are underrepresented: in certain areas of <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2021/09/03/diversity-grants-can-discourage-diverse-candidates-from-applying-for-more-lucrative-scholarships/">education</a> and <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2021/08/25/women-and-early-career-academics-experience-imposter-syndrome-in-fields-that-emphasise-natural-brilliance/">academia</a>, in <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2006/03/16/women-need-female-role-models/">politics</a>, and in <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2021/10/21/supportive-male-allies-can-make-male-dominated-workplaces-less-hostile-for-women/">senior leadership roles</a>. Efforts have been made across sectors to improve this representation, <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2020/08/06/how-stem-fields-can-foster-a-sense-of-belonging-for-minority-and-first-gen-students/">as we’ve particularly covered</a> in the case of STEM.</p>



<p>Unequal representation may start before the workplace or university, however — even before school. Exploring children’s literature, a <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0260566">new study</a> in <em>PLOS One </em>from researchers at Princeton and Emory universities finds an overrepresentation of male protagonists in children’s books, potentially reinforcing damaging societal expectations for those of all genders.</p>



<span id="more-45103"></span>



<p>To analyse gender representation in this context, the team gathered data on 3,280 children’s books published between 1960 and 2020: these books included award winners, bestsellers, recommendations given to parents and teachers, and those featured in publishing catalogues. Books were aimed at children aged 0-16, and only those featuring a single identifiable protagonists were included in the set.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The books that were included were then coded for the gender of the protagonist, the year of publication, the gender of the author, the age of the target audience, the type of character (human or a non-human being like an animal, alien, toy, or vehicle) and the genre of the book (fiction or non-fiction).</p>



<p>The team found that in the 1960s, almost three-quarters of books had male protagonists. This proportion decreased between 1960 and 2020, including over the last two decades — a continuing journey towards equity that spells good news for those seeking more representative gender representation in books. But the team’s analysis showed that even today, there is still underrepresentation of women and girls in children’s books.</p>



<p>This representation was also not uniform. Male authors were much less likely than female authors to feature women or girls as their protagonists; in fact, men were three times more likely to write a male protagonist than a female one. Non-fiction books and books that featured non-human characters were also less likely to feature female protagonists. Books aimed at younger rather than older children also less frequently featured a main character who was a woman or girl: books aimed at infants, for instance, featured male protagonists twice as often as female protagonists.</p>



<p><a></a>What the team did not look at, however, were the behaviours associated with the characters they surveyed. Were boy characters less emotional than girls, more interested in science, or more active? Even if the gender of characters is, frequency-wise, equal, what stereotypes or characteristics are being promoted in the content of the books? Similarly, a review could also take place looking at other elements of identity and experience: how non-binary genders, race, class, sexuality and disability are represented in children’s books and with what characteristics.</p>



<p>This is not just a case of representation for its own sake. Research has suggested that non-stereotypical protagonists can <a href="https://www.deepdyve.com/lp/springer-journals/examining-the-impact-of-fiction-literature-on-children-s-gender-EcO9Ql9iUE?impressionId=5e6806ee21685&amp;i_medium=docview&amp;i_campaign=recommendations&amp;i_source=recommendations">make a dent in gender stereotypes</a> in children and even make less gender-stereotypical behaviours <a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2013.00986/full">seem more acceptable</a>. More diverse books could potentially, therefore, help children of all genders debunk harmful stereotypes and feel more confident in themselves before they even get to school.</p>

<p style="text-align: center"><strong>Environmental Data and Impact-Oriented Modeling</strong></p>
<p><strong>Introduction:</strong></p>
<p>The <a href="https://sdgs.un.org/goals">United Nations Sustainable Development Goals</a> (SDGs) include the prevention of environmental degradation that can impact <a href="https://blogs.biomedcentral.com/on-medicine/2016/04/26/global-health-security-interconnected-world-bmc-medicine-attends-cugh-2016/">human health</a>. Data and publicly facing visualizations provide crucial information to better understand complex, public health problems so that decision makers and the public can understand the problem. This is done through a concept called impact-oriented modeling.</p>

Environmental degradation involves the destruction of environments and loss of wildlife. Immediate action is needed to reverse the damage.  The use of impact-oriented modeling demonstrates current damage and future changes, highlighting the necessity for decision makers and governments to make significant changes. </div></figcaption></figure>
<p><strong>Background:</strong></p>
<p>Most environmental data is collected from multiple methodologies of varying accuracy and precision resulting in poor and difficult data interpretation. Thus, there is a critical need to bring together these different data sources and to create better organization and visualization of the data. One solution is to use impact-oriented modeling to integrate the data and to help users employ and contextualize the data for behavioral modification.</p>
<p>Typically, policymakers value scientific models to help them make decisions that could have wide-ranging impacts. For example, with COVID-19, scientific models continue to be used to help inform policy makers on needed interventions to control the pandemic. Unfortunately, scientific models themselves can be difficult to interpret and understand except for the initiated. Also, scientific models and data need to be coupled with understandable outputs and visualizations to make the greatest impact. Combining these two key elements is the focus of impact-oriented modeling. More and more, policymakers are turning to impact-oriented modeling to help make thoughtful, scientific and research-informed decisions. Similarly, applying impact-oriented modeling to climate change data could help inform both policymakers and the general public about the issues and help inform the current discussions underway. Recently, a paper by Shah et al. (2021) created a 7 step framework for success of impact-oriented modeling that can be applied to climate change data.</p>
<p><strong>Key Considerations for Climate Change Impact-Oriented Modeling:</strong></p>
<p>&#8211;<strong>Agility:</strong> <em>Is the data providing timely information?</em> Environmental data and the implementation of a wide range of global and regional policy commitments on climate change requires responsiveness to new inputs of data and reflect current trends. The <a href="https://www.oecd.org/environment/">Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development</a> (OECD), the <a href="https://www.ipcc.ch/">Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change</a> (IPCC) and many others provide updated environmental indicators.</p>
<p>&#8211;<strong>Responsiveness:</strong> <em>Does the data respond to new evidence?</em> Models should allow the public and policy-makers to react to the data and should be responsive to the data in an iterative fashion. A feedback loop of action-information-reaction should drive models to continuously evolve along with climate change indicators. Detecting long-term trends of environmental data is affected by numerous factors, including the time span of available data. Moreover, determining which environmental variables are likely to allow for earlier detectable change in the data will allow current and planned monitoring programs to be more efficient in modifying user behaviors. For instance, Kural et al. (2021) developed a new climate-change dataset that comprises different types of adaptation-related activities and may be used to compare adaptability initiatives within and between International Organizations.</p>
<p>&#8211;<strong>Transparency:</strong> <em>Are the data and model’s mechanisms publicly available for validation?</em> The validation of models and data sources is crucial for accuracy verification, iteration and improvement. Many organizations provide environmental data that is fully open-source and make publicly available mechanisms of its models and its assumptions. Backtesting methodologies are crucial to ensure continuous iteration and improvement of data models.</p>
<p>&#8211;<strong>Usability:</strong> <em>Can the data and model be used easily and efficiently?</em> Environmental data and climate change indicators need to be fully accessible and easy to understand by the public. Clearly labeled colors and user friendly fonts are an important strategy for usability.</p>
<p>&#8211;<strong>Accessibility:</strong> <em>Can the data and model be understood and used by a broad audience, irrespective of scientific and other capabilities?</em> Environmental degradation and global warming depends on the cumulative behavior of individuals. As a broader understanding of environmental models and indicators could result in huge success or failures, models must use language and visuals that are simple in order to ensure accurate understanding. For example, the OECD provides <a href="https://www.oecd.org/environment/green-talks-live.htm">videos and webinars</a> related to environmental topics and targeting global audiences.</p>
<p>&#8211;<strong>Universality:</strong> <em>Do data and the model draw on inputs that are defined and measured consistently?</em> As the impact of environmental-related behaviors have broader effects, what happens across artificial political boundaries matters across the globe. Therefore, standardization and consistency in measuring environmental indicators allows a universal understanding of global warming. For example, the IPCC provides complete global climate data and scenarios for environmental changes.</p>
<p>&#8211;<strong>Adaptability:</strong> <em>Can the model be modified and adapted? </em>Efforts to provide useful and updated global environmental data demonstrates adaptability of environmental datasets to changes in climate change indicators and environmental policies implemented by policymakers. For example, <a href="https://www.journals.elsevier.com/environmental-science-and-policy/mendeley-datasets">Mendeley Datasets for Environmental Science and Policy</a> enables researchers to deposit any research data (such as raw and processed data, mechanisms and methods) associated with their research manuscripts.</p>
<p>&#8211; <strong>Actionability:</strong> <em>Does the model </em><em>direct stakeholders to clear next steps and action items?</em> Models that fail to provide action items may contribute to confusion or actions that violate environmental standards. In contrast, environmental models that provide clear actionable implications can contribute to wider positive effects. The environment portal of the OECD helps countries design and implement effective policies to address environmental problems and sustainably manage natural resources.</p>
<p><strong>To Sum Up…</strong></p>
<p>Environmental and climate change models need to fulfill the suggested considerations in order to provide scientific researchers with actionable, behavior-changing, and even life-saving information.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/oldest-drinking-straw-gold-silver-russia">Gold and silver tubes in a Russian museum are the oldest known drinking straws</a></h4>

              
                <p>Eight silver and gold tubes held in a Russian museum have long been thought to have been either ceremonial staffs or canopy supports. In reality, the long tubes are the oldest surviving drinking straws, researchers say.</p>



<p>People used <a href="https://doi.org/10.15184/aqy.2021.22">these high-end straws</a> to drink beer from a communal vessel more than 5,000 years ago, conclude archaeologist Viktor Trifonov of the Russian Academy of Sciences in St. Petersburg and colleagues. Excavations in 1897 in what’s now Armenia uncovered the metal tubes, jewelry and other goods in a burial mound containing three individuals from the <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/maikop-treasure-given-museum">Maikop culture</a>, which dates to between about 5,700 and 4,900 years ago (<em>SN: 6/7/30</em>).</p>



<p>Each slender tube extends for just over one meter. Four of the finds include a gold or silver bull figurine, punctured by a hole so that it could be slid up and down the tube. Meanings attributed to straws with or without figurines are unknown, Trifonov’s group says.</p>

<p>Residue from the inner surface of one tube, near its tapered tip, contains barley starch granules, cereal particles from a wild or domesticated plant and a pollen grain from a lime tree, the scientists report in the February <em>Antiquity</em>. Those may have been ingredients of a flavored beer, though <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/ancient-beer-brewing-malt-grains-europe">further work needs to confirm that the barley remains show fermentation damage</a> (<em>SN: 5/7/20</em>).</p>



<p>Maikop people, who inhabited southern Russia and southeastern Europe, probably had cultural ties to Sumerians living near the Persian Gulf, the researchers say. More than 4,000-year-old Sumerian carvings show people using long straws to drink from communal vessels.</p>



<p>Beer brewing began as early as around 13,000 years ago in the Middle East. And seal impressions on clay tablets dating to roughly 7,000 years ago in Iraq and Iran depict people drinking with straws.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/beetle-fly-fast-wing-bristles-stroke-tiny-featherwing">These tiny beetles fly fast thanks to wing bristles and a weird, wide stroke</a></h4>

              
                <p>Featherwing beetles are some of the world’s smallest flying insects. Yet they can rocket along with the speed and agility of much larger insects. Now, scientists have figured out how the beetles do it.&nbsp;</p>



<p>A wide wing stroke combined with lightweight, bristled wings allow the beetles <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-021-04303-7">to efficiently propel themselves through the air</a>, researchers report online January 19 in <em>Nature</em>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Some species of featherwing beetles are particularly tiny; two of the insects set end to end would barely reach a credit card’s thickness. At such small sizes, the air is viscous and air friction becomes a serious obstacle to flight. But previous research from entomologist Alexey Polilov of Lomonosov Moscow State University in Russia and colleagues showed that the insects can fly at speeds comparable to that of beetles three times as large.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Polilov and his team investigated this flying prowess further, studying one of the smallest featherwing beetles, <em>Paratuposa placentis</em>, using high-speed video and computational simulations.</p>





<p>The beetle’s style of beating its wings is unlike anything previously described, the team found. Its wings make a wide, figure-eight pattern, clapping together at the top of their upstroke to reduce drag and meeting again at the bottom of the downstroke. This wide motion gives the beetle extra power to push through the air.</p>



<p>Crucially, the beetle’s wings are made of bristles. Because of the air friction at these small sizes, those bristles allow the wings to have the flapping power of wings made of membranes, like those of a housefly, but for a lot less mass.</p>

<p>&nbsp;“The bristled wing rows almost as well [as membranous wings] without letting much air through, like the feather of a bird,” Polilov says.&nbsp;Video recordings of some other featherwing beetles show they have a similar flying style, the researchers say.</p>



<p>The beetles’ ancestors were larger than their modern kin. The findings give insights into how insects can retain important athletic abilities as they scale down in size.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A new catalyst has been found to be a valuable and cost-effective method for eliminating the dye, methylene blue, from water. Dyes are harmful pollutants released by the textile, food, and leather industries. When released into water, such as rivers, they can reduce sunlight transmission for photosynthesis, harm aquatic ecosystems, and impact public health. Methylene blue is a dye typically used for dyeing wool and silk. Several techniques have previously been developed for environmental dye pollution treatment, however, these methods are not suitable for industries operating on a small scale, due to high costs. Researchers in South Africa have developed a nanomaterial to enhance the degradation of methylene blue dye under light. The nanomaterials were found to effectively degrade methylene blue dye within 150 minutes, making them possible candidates for effective environmental pollution treatment. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Research has revealed that Tardigrada, or water bears, appear to have lost several signaling pathway genes from their genomes. These near-microscopic water-based animals are one of the world&#8217;s most resilient animals and are able to survive extreme conditions that would otherwise be lethal to many animals. Researchers at the </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">University of North Florida </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400">investigated the evolution of tardigrades and found that loss of &#8216;Wnt&#8217; genes may be related to their simplified development, anatomy, and miniaturization. Wnt genes code for molecules called ligands that activate signaling pathways for the animal’s development. The researchers suggest that the loss of several Wnt genes could be related to a reduced number of cells and simplified development that has helped these creatures to become almost immortal. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Regular, voluntary, shelter-wide testing for COVID-19 was found to be feasible in a homeless shelter in Germany. Living conditions in homeless shelters can facilitate the transmission of infectious diseases, such as COVID-19. Social factors and pre-existing health conditions also put homeless people more at risk of experiencing severe disease. COVID-19 outbreaks in homeless shelters have resulted in high infection levels amongst residents and staff. Researchers at the Charité Institute of Tropical Medicine and International Health carried out a study to evaluate universal testing for COVID-19 at a homeless shelter in Berlin. Shelter staff supported with PCR testing weekly testing of residents and the testing process was evaluated through group discussions and questionnaires. Shelter staff perceived the testing to be valuable and a good experience, but work-intensive. The researchers recommended a flexible approach to implementing shelter-wide testing, accounting for community levels of transmission, available resources, and local recommendations.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Higher levels of family support were associated with reductions in the risk of sleep dysfunction, short sleep duration, and poor sleep quality, in lesbian, gay, and bisexual (LGB) adults. Evidence suggests that LGB adults experience more sleep problems than the general population. Family support can play an important role in supporting the health and wellbeing of individuals and lack of family support has been associated with poorer sleep quality. LGB individuals are particularly at risk of experiencing lower family support. Researchers at the University of Toronto statistically analyzed UK longitudinal data that included 1703 LGB individuals. The researchers also found that support from a friend as a proxy for family did not diminish the effects of low family support on sleep problems. Future programmes to support LGB individuals with sleep problems could include examination of family support to inform the best route of care. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A ‘one-stop’ gynecological cancer ultrasound clinic was found to be highly effective in the management of patients referred for ovarian cancer screening. Approximately, 7000 women are diagnosed with ovarian cancer each year in the UK. Women in England with abdominal pain and bloating frequently have certain protein levels checked to screen for ovarian cancer. This has led to a significant rise in referrals to ovarian cancer services. To help manage demand, ‘one-stop’ clinics have been designed to manage referral demand, and facilitate quicker diagnosis and patient-centered care. In these clinics, patients will often be offered a consultation with a gynecology specialist and some also offer an ultrasound examination. Researchers carried out a retrospective review of a service in Northampton, UK, to examine the efficiency of one of these services. The service effectively provided a same-day full assessment, definitive diagnosis, and management plan to referred patients. Almost two-thirds of patients could be discharged back to primary care for repeat follow-up tests on the same day of their initial appointment. To further support the effectiveness of these services, the researchers suggest that ultrasound scan facilities should be rolled out to all one-stop gynecological cancer clinics. </span></p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/disinfectant-sawdust-kill-deadly-microbes-sustainable">A disinfectant made from sawdust mows down deadly microbes</a></h4>

              
                <p>A new, sustainable disinfectant made from sawdust and water can knock out more than 99 percent of some disease-causing microbes, including anthrax and several strains of flu.</p>



<p>Widespread use of some disinfectants can cause environmental harms. For instance, chlorine-containing ones, such as bleach, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/engineering-clean-drinking-water-treatment-pollution">can form dangerous by-products</a> when they react with other molecules (<em>SN: 11/25/18</em>). Some other potentially greener disinfectants rely on a compound called phenol or its chemical lookalikes, but they can be costly and energy-intensive to make.</p>



<p>Phenolic structures abound in wood, however, as part of the large, branching molecules that make up plant cell walls. So environmental engineer Shicheng Zhang of Fudan University in Shanghai and colleagues wondered if sawdust waste could provide a greener source of antimicrobial compounds.</p>



<p>The researchers cooked mixtures of water and sawdust for one hour under pressure and filtered them. Then the team tested the sawdust concoctions for their prowess at killing off the microbes <em>Staphylococcus epidermis</em>, a skin microbe that can cause infections in immunocompromised people, and <em>E. coli</em>, a gut microbe that can cause foodborne illness<em>. </em>Depending on a disinfectant’s concentration, it could zap more than 99 percent of the microbes, the team reports in the Jan. 18 <em>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences</em>.</p>





<p>The disinfectant was similarly successful <a href="https://www.pnas.org/content/119/3/e2106843119">at inactivating anthrax and influenza viruses</a>, the researchers found<em>.</em> It may also be potent against spores, a dormant form of bacteria that can be difficult to kill. Experiments showed it could inactivate the spores of a typically harmless bacteria, <em>Bacillus subtilis</em>.</p>



<p>A chemical analysis revealed that the sawdust-based soup contains high concentrations of phenol-like compounds. The pressure cooker treatment probably breaks the wood’s molecular chains, freeing up antimicrobial phenolic molecules.</p>



<p>Under a microscope, the scientists saw that their disinfectant damaged the cell walls of <em>E. coli</em> and <em>S. epidermis</em>. The phenolic compounds may also damage the proteins and genetic material of bacteria and viruses, Zhang says.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2022/01/19/coffee-cant-fix-all-the-cognitive-impairments-caused-by-a-bad-nights-sleep/">Coffee can’t fix all the cognitive impairments caused by a bad night’s sleep</a></h4>

              
                <p><em>By</em> <a href="https://emmayoung.net/">Emma Young</a></p>



<p>Many of us &#8220;treat&#8221; a bad night’s sleep with a couple of cups of coffee the next morning. But just how much does caffeine really help? Research shows that it makes a big difference to tasks that require &#8220;vigilant attention&#8221;, or continuous monitoring. One theory even holds that the cognitive deficits caused by sleep deprivation are underpinned by impairments in attention, and this implies that caffeine could be a general cure for sleep-deprivation ills. However, a <a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2021-46303-001">new study</a> in the <em>Journal of Experimental Psychology: Learning, Memory and Cognition</em> suggests that this is not the case. Caffeine indeed restored vigilant attention to regular levels in sleep-deprived participants. But it had barely any impact on another type of performance that is important for all kinds of jobs.</p>



<span id="more-45092"></span>



<p>Michelle E. Stepan at the University of Pittsburgh and colleagues studied 276 students with normal sleep habits. They came into the lab in the evening to complete two tasks. The first was a simple computer-based visual vigilance task — a red circle appeared on the screen at random intervals and every time they saw it, they had to click a mouse. If they took longer than 500ms to respond to a circle, this was counted as a lapse in attention.</p>



<p>The second task measured what’s called &#8220;place-keeping&#8221;. In this study, the participants had to keep track of where they were in a seven-step screen-based task. The participants were initially trained in how to complete the steps correctly, in the right order, and then expected to remember this information. Every so often, they were interrupted part-way through a sequence and asked to complete another brief task. They then went back to the original task. To resume correctly, and complete the steps in the right order, they had to remember where they’d broken off. The researchers counted the number of mistakes that they made.</p>



<p>After this, some participants were sent home to sleep as normal while the others were kept awake overnight in the lab. The next morning, the sleepers came back in, and all were given a capsule that contained either 200mg of caffeine or a placebo. Then they completed a second round of visual vigilance and place-keeping tests.</p>



<p>The differences in the results were clear. Sleep deprivation (without caffeine) impaired performance on both tasks, as expected. With caffeine, though, sleep-deprived people did just as well on the visual vigilance task as those who’d had a good night’s sleep (without morning caffeine). Caffeine clearly worked very well to fix this particular deficit. (Though those who’d slept and consumed caffeine did best of all.)</p>



<p>However, this wasn’t the case for the place-keeping task. A few did get some benefit from caffeine — the people who were worst at the task. But most of the sleep-deprived participants did not. For the majority, caffeine did not affect the cognitive processes needed for place-keeping.</p>



<p>The work implies that the theory that all of the cognitive deficits associated with sleep deprivation can be explained by impaired attention is wrong. And the team now calls for more work to get at exactly how a lack of sleep interferes with various types of cognitive processes.</p>



<p>But there’s an important practical message, too. Remembering where you are in a sequence of key steps, so that you can complete a procedure properly, is important in jobs everywhere from factories to hospitals. While caffeine does indeed help with simple attention, it could be a potentially dangerous mistake to think that it can fix sleep-deprivation deficits in performing this type of task, too.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/pyroclastic-flow-volcano-destruction-eruption">Volcanic avalanches of rock and gas may be more destructive than previously thought</a></h4>

              
                <p>Avalanches of ash, gas and rock that cascade downhill during volcanic eruptions may be even more dangerous than scientists had realized.</p>



<p>Pulses of high pressure form within these slides, known as pyroclastic flows, as a result of turbulence, laboratory and field measurements show. Those pressures <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-021-27517-9">can be far stronger</a>, and more destructive, than hazard assessments typically assume, researchers report December 15 in <em>Nature Communications</em>.</p>



<p>“It’s not a small difference,” says Gert Lube, a volcanologist at Massey University in Palmerston North, New Zealand. Conventional hazard assessments might suggest a certain flow will only burst windows, he says, “when actually, the pressures are so strong, they knock down the walls of the building.”</p>



<p><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/worlds-deadliest-volcanoes-and-how-they-kill">Pyroclastic flows</a> are the deadliest volcanic hazard (<em>SN: 6/5/18</em>), in part because of the pressures they generate. Due to their violent nature, researchers often have to estimate average obstacle-smashing pressures in the flows using computer simulations based on measurements of geologic deposits left by past flows.</p>

</div><figcaption>At Massey University in Palmerston North, New Zealand, researchers released mixtures of hot rock, ash and gas down a channel to replicate volcanic avalanches known as pyroclastic flows. These pyroclastic flows have an internal rhythm that makes them especially destructive, a new study suggests.</figcaption></figure>



<p>To directly study the inner workings of these forces of nature, Lube and colleagues reproduced smaller versions of the flows in experiments, measuring destructive factors like particle velocities and flow densities and temperatures. That let the team calculate the pressures inside the flows. The researchers also analyzed the first measurements of pressures in natural flows, collected in 2019, when <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/volcano-deadly-2019-eruption-new-zealand-satellite-data-monitoring">pyroclastic flows burst from the Whakaari volcano</a> and engulfed a set of infrasound sensors (<em>SN: 6/18/21</em>).</p>



<p>To the researchers’ surprise, pressures in the flows oscillated rhythmically, as volcanic particles clustered into cascading waves and trains of rolling eddies. These pressure pulses would successively damage obstacles like blows from a jackhammer, Lube says. The pulses sometimes smashed more than three times as hard as the average pressure estimates typically suggested by conventional hazard-gauging simulations.</p>



<p>Many hazard assessments are probably drastically underestimating pyroclastic flows’ destructiveness, Lube says. “It’s a big wake-up call.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2022/01/plos-digital-health-publishes-first-papers/">PLOS Digital Health publishes first papers</a></h4>

              
                <p>Note: PLOS published the following press release on January 18, 2022</p>



<p>SAN FRANCISCO &mdash; The Public Library of Science (PLOS) today announced that PLOS<em> Digital Health</em> published its initial cohort of papers. PLOS announced the launch of<a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2021/04/launching-new-journals-2021/"> </a><a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2021/04/launching-new-journals-2021/">five new journals last year</a> and PLOS<em> Digital Health</em> is the second of these journals with papers ready for publication. The journal&rsquo;s mission is to drive transformation in the delivery of equitable and unbiased healthcare through ethically conducted, impactful and immediately accessible research. The journal will accept papers from our diverse community of researchers, which will include engineers, social scientists and industry leaders among others. The journal has so far received nearly 150 submissions from researchers around the world.</p>



<p>&ldquo;More relevant than contributing to the field of digital health, I hope <em>PLOS Digital Health</em> will spearhead a movement among journals to take a more proactive role in diversifying the research community and re-drawing the unequal map of the medical knowledge system,&rdquo; said Editor-in-Chief, Leo Anthony Celi, <em>PLOS Digital Health</em>. &ldquo;We cannot address health disparities without tackling knowledge inequalities between rich and poor countries.&rdquo;</p>



<p>&ldquo;<em>PLOS Digital Health</em> centers Open Science practices; for example, preprinting, open data and open code,&rdquo; said Suzanne Farley, Editorial Director, PLOS. &ldquo;Embedding Open Science practices in emerging fields like digital health ensures their outputs can be relied upon to drive positive change in healthcare.&rdquo;</p>



<p>All PLOS journals are underpinned by institutional business models that move beyond the article processing charge (APC) to ensure more equitable and regionally appropriate ways to support Open Access publishing. <em>PLOS Digital Heath</em> utilizes our <a href="https://plos.org/resources/for-institutions/flat-fee-agreements/">Flat Fee model</a>. PLOS will waive the annual fee if a member institution is in a <a href="http://www.research4life.org/access/eligibility/">Research4Life country</a>. Our existing fee-assistance program also supports authors who are unable to pay any portion of their publication fees.</p>



<p>Our current Editorial Board is composed of more than 30 editors representing 15 countries, including 12 Section Editors, and reflects PLOS&rsquo; commitments towards building diverse, equitable and inclusive editorial boards. PLOS Digital Health&rsquo;s nearly 150 submissions came from 33 countries.</p>



<p>Here are links to three of the 10 papers that <em>PLOS Digital Health</em> just published, as well as two opinion pieces and one Review:</p>

              <h4><a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2022/01/contributorship/">What author order can (and cannot) tell us: Understanding contributorship</a></h4>

              
                <p>Written by <a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/author/lmorton/">Lindsay Morton</a> </p>



<p>Welcome back to the second in our <a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/?category=academic-contributions">three-part series</a> on academic credit. In this post, we focus on identifying researchers&rsquo; specific contributions to a research project, and explore how those contributions are reflected on a published paper. Authorship is central to the reward system of science and directly impacts each researchers&rsquo; career prospects. Yet standards for allocating authorship are variable, and often opaque. What types of contributions merit inclusion on an author list? How are we to understand the contributions of each researcher who is included on the list?</p>



<h2>Identifying specific author contributions</h2>



<p>In the biological and medical sciences, the degree of public credit a researcher receives for a publication is based on their position within the author list. While the significance of author order varies across disciplines and cultures, traditionally, there are two highly valued and much-coveted positions: first author, credited with conceptualizing and executing the central parts of the study, and last author, occupying the most senior, supervisory position. That can be problematic, because it does not provide a consistent and fair way to acknowledge the essential contributions of midlist authors. An average author list cannot communicate, for example, who developed critical methods, collected the data, ran the analysis, or wrote the first draft. In some cases, an author list may also include honorary authors, either as an expression of esteem, in an attempt to leverage a famous name, or because the honorary author has asked to be included in all publications within their sphere.</p>



<p>The inadequacy of the author list as a vehicle for expressing author contribution is also evident in team science. As research becomes increasingly cross-disciplinary and complex, in many cases, it&rsquo;s no longer possible for one person to lead and execute all aspects of a study. In team science, instead of organizing themselves hierarchically, researchers work together, with two or more equal partners taking on the responsibilities of a senior researcher within their specific areas of expertise, for example data collection and stewardship, statistics and design, coding, or methodological development. Our systems for allocating and representing academic credit have not kept pace with the ways researchers work today.</p>



<p>The importance and yet the ambiguity of the author list creates, at the very least, inaccurate and unfair perceptions about the contributions and capabilities of the researchers involved. It can also conceal bias and work to keep researchers from under-represented groups in midlist, junior roles. Because the allocation of credit is so central to how a research scientist is perceived, and to the future of their career, a fair and accurate representation of each author&rsquo;s contribution is vital.</p>



<h2>Solution: Tracking <em>all </em>author contributions with CRediT</h2>



<p><a href="https://casrai.org/credit/">CRediT (Contributor Roles Taxonomy)</a> is a universal, community-developed open classification system that uses 14 different roles to describe the aspects of scientific authorship, from conceptualization to review and editing. Each author listed on a manuscript is assigned one or more taxonomic roles. Role assignments appear on the final published research article and are encoded into article meta-data where they can be harvested by databases and indexers.</p>



<p>The granularity of the CRediT taxonomy diminishes the importance of author order. For example, tenure applicants need not be evaluated on how many times they were listed as first author, but on their specific contributions to each work. The CRediT taxonomy also reinforces the <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/s/authorship?utm_source=plos&amp;utm_medium=blog&amp;utm_campaign=plos-1607-credit">author qualification guidelines</a> by clearly highlighting instances of honorary authorship to authors at submission, giving them the opportunity to pause and consider the composition of their author list.</p>



<p>The CRediT taxonomy distinguishes itself from other, publisher- or discipline-specific author taxonomies in that it is both broadly applicable within the sciences and widely accepted, enabling it to establish norms and shared understanding across publishers, funders, and universities.</p>



<p>PLOS was part of the <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/508312a">working group</a> that originally developed and tested the CRediT taxonomy. When the system was <a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2016/07/author-credit-plos-and-credit-update/">finalized</a>, PLOS transitioned from our previous, publisher-specific taxonomy to the new tool.</p>



<h2 id="video">A meta-analysis of the CRediT taxonomy</h2>



<p>CRediT has opened new avenues for meta-research, enabling scientists to better understand not only how each other contributed to the work, but to begin to identify and interpret patterns in contributorship that expose larger truths about the way science operates, and can point the way toward more efficient, robust and inclusive scientific practices. In the video below, we chat with Dr Cassidy Sugimoto and Dr Vincent Larivi&egrave;re about their recent study &ldquo;Investigating the division of scientific labor using the Contributor Roles Taxonomy (CRediT)&rdquo; and discuss ideas for future studies.</p>

<h3>More opportunities for authorship</h3>



<p>As the CRediT taxonomy helps to illustrate, writing articles is just one small part of conducting research. In addition to properly allocating credit for traditional research articles and peer review, Open Science also offers new opportunities to surface, share, and receive credit for more of the research process, including both open data and open methods, such as Registered Reports, Lab and Study Protocols, Methods Research Articles, and linked code. Sharing these research outputs as stand-alone resources allows them to accumulate citations in their own right, independent of the main research article, and increases discoverability by creating more points of entry. At the same time, making research artifacts public enhances trust in related research articles. Over time, a pattern of openness can help to build a reputation for high-quality research, collaborative sharing, and leadership.</p>



<h2>Coming up</h2>



<p>In the next post in this series, we&rsquo;ll discuss the importance of peer review, and how we can better acknowledge and reward the contributions peer reviewers make to published research.&nbsp;</p>

              <h4><a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2022/01/18/can-memes-help-people-cope-with-pandemic-induced-anxiety/">Can memes help people cope with pandemic-induced anxiety?</a></h4>

              
                <p><em>By </em><a href="http://emilyoliviareynolds.com/">Emily Reynolds</a></p>



<p>The Covid-19 pandemic has had a huge impact on our collective mental health, from its effects on the experience of postnatal depression among <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2021/06/08/rates-of-postnatal-depression-among-new-mothers-rose-sharply-during-lockdown/">new mothers</a> to the ongoing impact of <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2021/09/09/first-hand-reports-of-brain-fog-highlight-struggles-of-those-living-with-long-covid/">post-Covid brain fog</a>. Research has also looked at what might remedy some of these negative effects — <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2021/03/03/during-lockdown-meaningful-activity-is-more-fulfilling-than-simply-staying-busy/">engaging in meaningful activity</a>, for example, or making changes in our lives to <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2020/12/02/coping-with-remote-working-during-covid-19-the-latest-research-digested/">feel more in control</a>.</p>



<p>Umair Akram and colleagues explore another potential technique <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-021-00857-8">in their paper</a> in <em>Scientific Reports</em> —looking at memes. They find that pandemic-related memes could provide one coping mechanism for people experiencing anxiety, with anxious people more likely to find them funny, relatable, and shareable. </p>



<span id="more-45067"></span>



<p>First, the team showed participants 45 of the highest rated memes from the subreddit <a href="http://reddit.com/r/coronavirusmemes">/Coronavirusmemes</a>, each of which depicted an image with a short, humorous caption related to the pandemic. On a scale from 1 to 5, participants indicated how negative, relatable, funny, offensive and shareable each meme was. They then completed a measure of symptoms of anxiety and indicated whether any friends or family had been unwell with coronavirus.</p>



<p>The participants also completed a scale assessing what emotional regulation strategies they use, measuring the extent to which they use “cognitive appraisal” — changing the way they think about a situation — and “expressive suppression” — changing behaviour in response to emotional events.</p>

<p>Ratings of the memes did not differ across demographic categories — there was no difference by age, gender, or whether anyone close to them had had coronavirus. But when comparing anxious and non-anxious participants, there was a big difference. More anxious participants rated the memes as funnier, more relatable and more shareable, though there was no difference between these two groups when it came to how positive or negative or offensive they found them.</p>



<p>Browsing r/CoronavirusMemes, you start to see why someone experiencing anxiety might relate to these memes. Many of them discuss isolation, loneliness, death, and illness — so someone who is feeling something distressing could find some comfort in their equally dark themes. Despite this, however, participants did not rate the images as negative. The team suggests that there may have been an emotional blunting towards these themes — because we were deluged with (mostly bad) news about the virus, this plus the humour of the images may have dulled their negative themes.</p>



<p>In fact, the researchers suggest that it’s possible the memes could act as a coping mechanism. By making light of a serious event, negative experiences can be reappraised, making them less anxiety inducing. And the fact that memes are shared online facilitates a feeling of peer support: the comforting idea that we are all in this together.</p>



<p>This suggestion may need deeper exploration. Humour can certainly serve as a balm in difficult times — previous research has found a similar pattern, with people with depression <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2020/02/14/people-with-depression-may-find-sad-memes-funnier-and-more-uplifting/">finding sad memes</a> funnier and more uplifting. But looking at a meme is likely to be a momentary experience and may not do much for long-term anxiety or depression. Looking at ways to incorporate humour into coping strategies or other treatments warrants further research.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/history-math-online-exhibit-journey">Take an online journey through the history of math</a></h4>

              
                <p>Around 1900 B.C., a student in the Sumerian city of Nippur, in what’s now Iraq, copied a multiplication table onto a clay tablet. Some 4,000 years later, that schoolwork survives, as do the student’s errors (10 times 45, for example, is definitely not 270). The work is a reminder that no matter how elegant or infallible mathematics may seem, it’s still a human endeavor.</p>



<p>That’s one lesson I took from “<a href="https://history-of-mathematics.org/">History of Mathematics</a>,” an online exhibit developed by the National Museum of Mathematics in New York City and Wolfram Research, a computational technology company. Bringing together the Sumerian tablet and more than 70 other artifacts, the exhibit demonstrates how math has been a universal language across cultures and throughout time.</p>



<p>Divided into nine “galleries,” the exhibit sums up the development of key topics related to mathematics, including counting, arithmetic, algebra, geometry and prime numbers. Each gallery has a short timeline and features a handful of artifacts that serve as entry points to explore some milestones in more depth.</p>







<p>Among the highlights: The oldest known surviving calculating device, the Salamis Tablet, is a marble counting board from the Greek island of Salamis dating to 300 B.C. It’s a precursor to the abacus. By moving pebbles across the board, a person could perform calculations. An early documented instance of using a symbol for “zero” as a placeholder (to, say, distinguish 1 from 10, 100 or 1,000) appears in the Bakhshali Manuscript, an Indian text dating to perhaps as early as A.D. 300. The manuscript’s black dots eventually morphed into the open circles we know today as zeros. Also on display is <em>Al-Jabr</em>. Written in around 820 by Persian polymath Muḥammad ibn Mūsā al-Khwārizmī, the book established the field of algebra and gave the discipline its name. In 1557, the <em>Whetstone of Witte</em>, an English algebra text, introduced the modern equal symbol.</p>



<p>But the exhibit is more than just a collection of fun facts. As the galleries explain, humans’ relationship with numbers goes back deep into prehistory. Modern math, however, stems from the rise of cities, with the need to keep track of people and supplies, and to undertake ever more complex construction projects.</p>



<p>Some mathematical principles must have been so vital to civilization’s success that they appeared in many ancient cultures. Take the Pythagorean theorem. The Greek philosopher Pythagoras, who lived in the sixth century B.C., famously related the side lengths of a right triangle in the equation a<sup>2</sup> + b<sup>2</sup> = c<sup>2</sup>. But a clay tablet reveals that people in Mesopotamia had worked out the relationship more than 1,000 years earlier. Ancient Chinese and Indian scholars were also familiar with the relationship.</p>

<p>Other math problems have had multiple solutions. The history of counting is littered with an array of methods for keeping track of numbers, from various forms of finger counting to the stringed recording devices called quipus, or khipus, used in the Inca Empire in the 1400s and 1500s. The placement and types of knots along a quipu’s strings indicate different numerical values, though researchers today are still trying to understand exactly how <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/khipus-knotted-cords-incas-taxes">to interpret the data recorded on these devices</a> (<em>SN: 7/6/19 &amp; 7/20/19, p. 12</em>).</p>



<p>Parts of the exhibit assume a high level of mathematical knowledge, such as some of the interactive features that give technical explanations behind some artifacts’ mathematical principles. But a section of “learning journeys” aimed at “kids and others” provides materials that fill in some of the missing details from the main galleries and will appeal to adults whose memories of high school or college math are fuzzy.</p>



<p>“History of Mathematics” is a fascinating starting point for anyone interested in learning about the origins of the mathematical concepts that so many of us use every day but often take for granted. </p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/animal-dna-air-scientist-vacuum-first-time-zoo">Scientists vacuumed animal DNA out of thin air for the first time</a></h4>

              
                <p>On a dreary winter day in December of 2020, ecologist Elizabeth Clare strolled through the Hamerton Zoo Park in England wielding a small vacuum pump. She paused outside of animal enclosures, holding aloft a flexible tube attached to the machine. Her mission: suck animal DNA out of thin air.</p>



<p>The ability to sniff out animals’ airborne genetic material has been on scientists’ wish list for over a decade. DNA collected from water has been used to track aquatic species, including salmon and <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/shark-dna-census-oceans">sharks</a> (<em>SN: 5/7/18</em>). Scientists knew they could use environmental DNA, or eDNA, in the air to monitor land-based species — if only they could trap it. Now, researchers have done just that by using vacuums, two independent groups report January 6 in <em>Current Biology.</em></p>



<p>“It’s such a crazy idea,” says Clare, of York University in Toronto. “We’re vacuuming DNA out of the sky.”</p>



<p>The idea came to Clare, who did the work while at Queen Mary University of London, during a previous experiment in which she sampled air outside naked mole rat burrows. At the zoo, Clare and colleagues ran the vacuum pump for half-hour sessions in and around animal enclosures, collecting 72 samples from 20 sites. Then, the team took the material ensnared in the pump’s filter back to the lab for analysis.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, another team at the University of Copenhagen was unknowingly chasing the same idea. Biologist Kristine Bohmann and colleagues sought to trap airborne DNA at the Copenhagen Zoo using tiny fans similar to the ones that cool down computers. The team also experimented with a vacuum. Deploying their contraptions between 30 minutes and 30 hours at the tropical house, stables and in open air, the researchers found that both the fan and vacuum method collected ample animal DNA.</p>



<p>“It was so much fun,” Bohmann says. “It felt like we could just play around and be creative.”</p>





<p>To test the technique, both teams used a zoo for its roster of animals. Air in the wild could host DNA from unpredictable places, but at zoos, the researchers could cross-reference the captured airborne DNA with animals listed in exhibits. That allowed the scientists to confirm the source of the DNA, and see how far it traveled between enclosures.</p>





<p>Bohmann and colleagues <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0960982221016900">identified 49 different vertebrate species in the Copenhagen Zoo</a>. They detected animals living in the sampled enclosures, such as okapis (<em>Okapia johnstoni</em>) in the stables and a Dumeril’s ground boa (<em>Acrantophis dumerili</em>) in the rainforest house. But the researchers also picked up on mammals and birds from surrounding exhibits as well as fish used as food. “That was quite surprising,” Bohmann says.</p>



<p>At the Hamerton zoo, Clare’s team <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096098222101650X">identified 25 different species</a>, including not only targeted zoo residents, but also unexpected ones. In the dingo enclosure, the team detected DNA from meerkats (<em>Suricata suricatta</em>) that live 245 meters away.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Zoo outsiders also turned up in each team’s results. Clare’s team detected the European hedgehog (<em>Erinaceus europaeus)</em>, which is endangered in England, while Bohmann’s group picked up on mice and domesticated dogs. They caught whiffs of human DNA too.</p>



<p>Sucking DNA from the air could be a noninvasive way to identify where endangered species have been by picking up on their genetic footprints, Bohmann says. The method would be an upgrade from camera traps, which work only when critters wander by, she says.</p>



<p><a></a>Neither team knew the other was working on the same concept. They got in touch after seeing an early version of each other’s studies on a preprint server. Clare describes it as “the most enormous scientific coincidence” of either of their lives. The teams chose to publish their studies together to corroborate each other’s results and further the adoption of their emerging ideas.</p>



<p>Just how this proof-of-concept technology will translate in the field is unclear. Airborne eDNA in the wild is more dispersed, and detection may be impacted by environmental factors such as weather and wind. But just as aquatic eDNA has progressed over the last decade, so too will airborne eDNA, Clare says. “I&#8217;m really looking forward to seeing other people go out and use the technique.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/covid-coronavirus-smell-taste-gene-genetic">A genetic analysis hints at why COVID-19 can mess with smell</a></h4>

              
                <p>For many people, one of the fastest tip-offs that they have COVID-19 is the loss of taste or smell. Now researchers have pinpointed some genetic variants in people that may make it more likely that the coronavirus might rob them of these senses.</p>



<p>A study of nearly 70,000 adults with COVID-19 found that individuals with certain genetic tweaks on chromosome 4 were <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41588-021-00986-w">11 percent more likely to lose the ability to smell or taste</a> than people without the changes, researchers report January 17 in <em>Nature Genetics</em>. The data come from people who’d had their DNA analyzed by genetic testing company 23andMe and self-reported a case of COVID-19.</p>



<p>Two genes, <em>UGT2A1 </em>and <em>UGT2A2</em>, that help people smell reside in the region of chromosome 4 linked to sensory loss during infection, epidemiologist Janie Shelton of 23andMe and colleagues found. Both genes make enzymes that metabolize substances called odorants, which produce distinctive smells.</p>



<aside class="wp-block-sciencenews-inline-related-post"><h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/sign-up-for-e-mail-updates-on-the-coronavirus-outbreak">Sign up for e-mail updates on the latest coronavirus news and research</a></h4></aside>





<p>Studies suggest that loss of smell, a hallmark symptom of COVID-19, stems from infections taking hold in <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/covid-19-coronavirus-sense-smell-brain-nerve-cells">smell-supporting cells</a> called sustentacular cells (<em>SN: 6/12/20</em>). It’s possible that the genetic variants near <em>UGT2A1 </em>and <em>UGT2A2</em> could affect how the two genes are turned on or off to somehow mess with smell during an infection, Shelton says.</p>



<p>The team combined loss of smell and taste in one survey question so the study can’t parse whether the genetic variants are involved in the loss of one sense over the other. “When you lose your taste of smell, often your taste is highly diminished,” Shelton says. Taste can also go away without loss of smell.</p>



<p>Some people have a sustained loss of smell, even after the coronavirus leaves their bodies, Shelton says. Understanding how the virus snuffs out sniffing ability could help researchers find ways to bring it back.</p>

                <p><em>By </em><a href="http://emilyoliviareynolds.com/">Emily Reynolds</a></p>



<p>We get our information about health from many sources. Sometimes we seek advice from doctors or other medical professionals; sometimes we talk to friends or family; we read newspapers and watch TV; and we diagnose ourselves with rare and alarming afflictions with the help of the internet.</p>



<p>In some ways, this variety offers a democratisation of knowledge, a way for more of us to understand what’s going on with our health. But what happens when this information contradicts itself? This is the subject of a <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs10865-021-00256-4">new study</a> from a team at Rutgers University, published in the <em>Journal of Behavioral Medicine.</em></p>



<span id="more-45053"></span>



<p>Participants were first asked to read an article focused on whole grain intake and the health benefits of such food. In one condition, participants were shown positions on the topic that were congruent, reading that experts agreed whole grains were indeed healthy. In the other condition, participants read that experts disagreed about whether there were positive outcomes from eating whole grains.</p>



<p>They then took part in a game designed to test attention, in which they had to indicate as quickly as possible the direction of a target arrow, displayed among distractor arrows.</p>



<p>Following the game, participants rated how mentally demanding the task was, and indicated how confused they were about which foods are best to eat and how bored and tired they were of <em>hearing</em> about what foods are best to eat.</p>



<p>Those who had read conflicting health information had a lower correct response rate in the attention task than those who had read congruent information. These participants also took longer to respond to each stimuli during the trials, suggesting a decrease in cognitive processing speed. There was also a difference in how mentally demanding the task was for participants: those receiving conflicting information rated the game as being more work than those who did not. The team therefore suggests that the cognitive resources needed to process conflicting information can impact important attentional mechanisms.</p>



<p>Those who saw conflicting health information were also more likely to be confused by nutritional information, and had greater feelings of backlash towards nutritional information. This suggests that conflicting health information can not only tire us out and dull our responses but may also impact our behaviour, potentially putting us off from following advice about our health.</p>



<p>So how do we stop people from being overwhelmed by conflicting information? The team suggests that, in a clinical setting, health practitioners should seek to understand whether patients have been exposed to inconsistent messages, and help them clarify what they believe and why. More broadly, educational programmes that help people understand how best to analyse information could also ease some of the attentional demand of conflicting advice. And while we can’t prevent exposure to <em>all</em> forms of conflicting health information, the study may be one motivation to stop those anxiety-inducing Google self-diagnosis spirals.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/kunga-donkey-wild-ass-hybrid-biology">Part donkey, part wild ass, the kunga is the oldest known hybrid bred by humans</a></h4>

              
                <p>From mules to ligers, the list of human-made hybrid animals is long. And, it turns out, ancient.</p>



<p>Meet the kunga, the earliest known hybrid animal bred by people. The ancient equine from Syro-Mesopotamia existed around 4,500 years ago and was <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.abm0218">a cross between a donkey and a hemippe</a>, a type of Asiatic wild ass, researchers report January 14 in <em>Science Advances</em>.</p>



<p>Horses didn’t appear in this region of Asia until 4,000 years ago, centuries after<a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/dna-genes-modern-domestic-horses-origin-russia"> their domestication in Russia</a> (<em>SN: 10/20/21</em>). But dozens of equine skeletons were excavated in the early 2000s from a royal burial complex dating back to 2600 B.C. at Umm el-Marra in northern Syria. The animals, whose physical features didn’t match any known equine species, appear to be “kungas” — horselike animals seen in artwork and referenced in clay tablets predating horses by centuries.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“They were highly valued, very expensive,” says paleogeneticist Eva-Maria Geigl of Institut Jacques Monod in Paris.</p>





<p>Geigl and her colleagues analyzed a kunga’s genome, or genetic instruction book, and compared it with those of horses, donkeys and Asiatic wild asses, including the hemippe (<em>Equus hemionus hemippus</em>), which has been extinct since 1929.&nbsp;The kunga’s mother was a donkey and its father a hemippe, making it the oldest evidence of humans creating hybrid animals. A mule from 1000 B.C. in Anatolia reported by the same research group in 2020 is the <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.abb0030">next oldest hybrid</a>.</p>



<p>Geigl thinks kungas were created for warfare, as they could pull wagons. Coaxing donkeys into dangerous situations is hard, she says, and no Asiatic wild ass can be tamed.&nbsp;But a hybrid might have had the characteristics people sought.</p>

<p>Coauthor E. Andrew Bennett, a paleogeneticist now at the Chinese Academy of Sciences in Beijing, likens kungas to “bioengineered war machines.” But with the riddle of how kungas were made being solved a century after the last hemippe perished, “it’s impossible to make these animals again.”</p>

<p><strong>The decision on the shuttle is ‘go’</strong>&nbsp;—&nbsp;<a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/decision-shuttle-go"><em>Science News</em></a><em>,</em>&nbsp;January 15, 1972</p>



<p>President Nixon’s announcement last week of the decision to begin development of a space shuttle system may prove to be nearly as crucial to the future of the manned space program as the 1961 Kennedy challenge to land a man on the moon. </p>



<h4>Update</h4>



<p>The shuttle program was NASA astronauts’ ticket to space for 30 years. Beginning in 1981, five reusable spacecraft carried out many important missions, including helping to build the International Space Station and carrying the <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/celebrating-25-years-hubble-space-telescope">Hubble Space Telescope</a> into orbit. Despite initial hopes that the shuttles would usher in an era of low-cost spaceflight, the program was deemed too expensive to continue and ended in 2011. Recently, NASA has begun working with private companies to transport astronauts to low Earth orbit. In 2020, SpaceX <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/space-spacex-crew-launch-mars-satellites-2020">flew six astronauts to the International Space Station</a> (<em>SN: 12/19/20&nbsp;&amp; 1/2/21, p. 36</em>). Last April, NASA announced it had tapped SpaceX to ferry astronauts to the surface of the moon as part of the upcoming <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/electron-beam-space-moon-dust-zap-clean-up">Artemis program</a>.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2022/01/14/our-mental-self-portraits-contain-clues-about-our-personalities/">Our mental self-portraits contain clues about our personalities</a></h4>

              
                <p><em>By</em> <a href="https://emmayoung.net/">Emma Young</a></p>



<p>If I ask you to picture your face and body in your mind, what do you see? And how do your beliefs and attitudes about your self — including your personality and your self-esteem — influence these mental self-images? Completely fascinating answers to these questions have now been reported in a <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/09567976211018618">new paper</a> in <em>Psychological Science</em>. The findings are important not just for understanding how we all see ourselves, but could also be useful for studies into body image disorders.</p>



<span id="more-45042"></span>



<p>Artistic self-portraits have long been recognised as reflecting aspects of the artist’s identity and emotions, as well as their physical self. But they’re often drawn from photographs or reflections in a mirror. How any of us really see ourselves <em>in our mind’s eye</em> has been very difficult to explore experimentally. To do this, Lara Maister at Bangor University and colleagues used a technique that required 77 student participants to <a href="https://osf.io/9jrpu/">look at 500 pairs of faces in turn and each time indicate which they felt most looked like their own</a>. All the chosen faces were then averaged to produce a final self-portrait. The students also completed a Big Five personality test and a self-esteem scale, and had a passport-style photo taken, for comparison.</p>



<p>The researchers used a face-recognition algorithm to analyse the self-portrait and the passport photo for each participant. This produced a measure of how different the two were. The team certainly found similarities (confirmed by human raters) — an individual’s self-portrait <em>did</em> resemble his or her photo more than other participants’ photos. However, other factors beyond physical appearance also seemed to be influencing people’s self-portraits.</p>



<p>To see whether one of these factors could be personality characteristics, the team had an independent group of participants act as personality raters. They were shown the pairs of self-portraits and passport-style photos and asked how strongly they perceived each of the Big Five personality traits in both. The results showed that these raters’ judgements were not random. Both self-portraits and photos clearly contained visual information that allowed the raters to make personality ratings that tallied to some extent with the participants’ self-reported personalities. (The paper doesn’t mention exactly what facial information allowed raters to make these judgements, but <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-65358-6">earlier research has found that genes and also pre- and post-natal hormone exposure can influence both face shape and personality</a>, and extraversion has been linked to facial symmetry, for example.)</p>



<p>The team then ran further analyses on the self-portraits and the personality ratings. And they found that the higher the original participants’ self-ratings on a particular trait, such as extraversion, the more facial features associated with that trait were present in their self-portrait, <em>above</em> the level present in their photo. So for a self-reported extravert, say, their mental image of their own face had exaggerated extraversion-related facial features. This certainly suggests that our <em>perceptions</em> of our personalities influence our mental images of our own faces. And this is interesting for all sorts of reasons, not least this: if explicitly asked, most people surely wouldn’t be able to link particular facial features to personality traits, but we seem to have an implicit understanding of these links.</p>



<p>Maister and her colleagues then switched from faces to bodies. This time, 39 young female students picked from a series of pairs of body silhouettes, rather than faces, producing a body shape self-portrait. They also completed a questionnaire on body self-esteem and they were weighed and measured.</p>



<p>The researchers homed in one just one physical measurement: hip width. They found that, unlike in the first study, there was only a “negligible” relationship between the perceived and actual measure. But they did find that those who had low body self-esteem were more likely to perceive their hip width as being bigger than it actually was. Also, the lower a participant’s body-self-esteem, the slimmer they reported a &#8220;typical&#8221; female body to be.</p>



<p>This work shows that our perceptions of who we are, in terms of our personality and how we feel about ourselves, affect our mental visual images of ourselves. In fact, the team writes, the work points to a “close, interactive relationship between physical and psychological representations of the self”.</p>



<p>Body-images were less aligned with reality than were face self-portraits, and more influenced by how happy the individual was with their own body. We don’t see our unclothed bodies&nbsp; as often as we see our faces, and this could be a factor here.</p>



<p>The team suggests that their approach could be used with people with clinical disorders of body image, such as anorexia or body dysmorphia. “Our approach could be used as a unique, direct method of assessing distortions in visual memory in these patients, allowing us to reveal whether they stem from higher level self-beliefs and attitudes or even a disorder in the link between these attitudes and the physical self-representation,” they write. It could also be used to explore how well treatments are working.</p>



<p>In fact, it could be used in all kinds of research — such as whether people who routinely take selfies have mental face images that are more aligned with reality, or whether <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2020/03/12/taking-selfies-is-probably-fine-for-your-self-esteem-editing-them-might-not-be/">any potential impacts on self-esteem</a> might warp their images instead.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/supernova-star-early-outburst-explosion-warning-death">An early outburst portends a star’s imminent death</a></h4>

              
                <p>A star’s death usually comes without warning. But an early sign of one star’s imminent demise hints at what happens before some stellar explosions.</p>



<p>In a last hurrah before exploding, a star brightened, suggesting that it blasted some of its outer layers into space. It’s the first time scientists have spotted a <a href="https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ac3f3a">pre-explosion outburst</a> from a run-of-the-mill type of exploding star, or supernova, researchers report in the Jan. 1 <em>Astrophysical Journal</em>.</p>



<p>Scientists have previously seen harbingers of unusual types of supernovas. But “what’s nice about this one is it’s a much more normal, vanilla … supernova that’s showing this eruption before explosion,” says astronomer Mansi Kasliwal of Caltech, who was not involved with the research.</p>



<p>On September 16, 2020, scientists discovered the explosion of a star roughly 10 times as massive as the sun, located about 120 million light-years away. Thankfully, telescopes that regularly survey a swath of the sky, as part of an effort called the Young Supernova Experiment, had been observing the star well before it detonated. About 130 days before the explosion, the star brightened, the researchers found, the start of a pre-explosion eruption.</p>





<p>The final explosion was a commonplace type of stellar detonation called a type 2 supernova, which occurs when the core of an aging star collapses. Precursors to such explosions probably hadn’t been seen before because the early eruptions are faint. For this supernova, scientists had observations of the star sensitive enough to pick up the relatively weak eruption.</p>



<p>Previous post-explosion observations of such supernovas have hinted <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/supernova-explosion-2020fqv-tess-hubble">that the stars slough off layers</a> before death. In 2021, astronomers reported signs of a supernova&#8217;s shock wave plowing into material that the star had expelled (<em>SN: 11/2/21</em>). A similar sign of cast-off stellar material was also found in the new study.</p>



<p>Scientists aren’t sure exactly what causes such early outbursts. They could be the result of events happening deep within a star, for example, as the star burns different types of fuel as it nears death. If more such events are found, scientists may eventually be able to predict which stars will go boom, and when.</p>



<p>Precursor outbursts are a sign that stars experience inner turmoil before exploding, says study coauthor Raffaella Margutti, an astrophysicist at the University of California, Berkeley. “The main message that we are getting from the universe is that these stars are really knowing that the end is coming.”</p>

<hr />
<p>My work relates to the WHO Sustainable Development Goal <a href="https://unric.org/en/sdg-3/">SDG3 </a>and focuses on ensuring healthy lives and promoting well-being for all. I have experience in microbial genomics and computational approaches. My research looks at the use of genomic methods for pathogen detection, characterisation as well as understanding transmission dynamics and acquisition of antimicrobial resistance at hospitals and community settings. I am proud to collaborate in achieving SDG3 by working with National Public Health Institutes (NPHI) in Africa facilitating access to sustainable DNA sequencing technologies for rapid and timely response to common infectious disease threats, including drug resistance. Recently, my group has developed an automated &amp; highly scalable assembly, annotation, and higher-level analyses microbial computational pipeline for genomic data called <em>rMAP</em>: Rapid microbial analysis, profiling pipeline, and visualisation (<a href="https://bit.ly/36g809L">https://bit.ly/36g809L</a>).</p>
<p>Some of the challenges I have encountered during my research include limited access to DNA sequencing technologies, competitive funding, or high-performance computing (HPC) bioinformatic environments to support large-scale data analyses. However, I have established research collaborations and networks to increase funding opportunities and access to DNA sequencing technologies and HPC. For example, in 2019, the U.S. National Institutes of Health launched the second African Center of Excellence in Bioinformatics (ACE) at the Infectious Diseases Institute in Makerere University’s College (<a href="https://ace.idi.co.ug/">https://ace.idi.co.ug/</a>). This center serves as a regional bioinformatics HPC resource for training and collaborative research for institutions in Africa.</p>

<p><strong>Tools that read and interpret gene variations to enable customized medical care during HIV testing, treatment &amp; management</strong></p>
<p>HIV infection results from the expansion of a single or limited number of viral variants (genetically different copies of the virus). The differences in HIV virus come into existence after stable changes occur in its genes. This can happen during the exchange of genetic material between different HIV viruses in the body or after certain viral gene combinations become more prevalent than others due to exposure to antiretroviral therapy (ART) regimens. But also, sometimes viruses do not naturally develop smoothly from one stage to the next in a logical way. ART, the drugs used to treat HIV/AIDS, continue to save the lives of tens of millions of people living with HIV/AIDS (PLWHA). At the end of 2020, 27.5 million people, out of an estimated 37.7 million PLWHA, were receiving ART globally. This increased use of ART has been accompanied by the emergence of HIV drug resistance (HIVDR) – the levels of which have steadily increased in recent years. HIVDR is caused by changes in HIV genes that affect the ability of drugs to stop the multiplication of the virus. All ART drugs are at risk of becoming partly or fully inactive due to the emergence of drug-resistant virus strains. HIVDR leads to increased numbers of HIV infections and HIV-associated illnesses and deaths. The World Health Organization (WHO) report revealed that in 2020, 64% of countries with a high burden of HIV infections had growing HIVDR and recommended national action plans to prevent, monitor and respond to HIVDR. HIV virological failure (VF) signals treatment effectiveness and occurs when ART fails to suppress and sustain one&#8217;s viral load to &lt;200 viral copies per ml and is normally associated with HIVDR. It is estimated that 24% of HIV patients in Sub-Saharan Africa have experienced VF. HIVDR and VF remain barriers to reaching the Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS) fast-track goal of ending AIDS by 2030.</p>
<p>Sanger sequencing (method of gene sequencing involving electrophoresis and is based on the random incorporation of chain-terminating dideoxynucleotides) is the gold standard for HIVDR testing but is limited by non-detection of resistance-associated variants with prevalence &lt;20% yet these cause VF. Next-generation sequencing or NGS (multiplies millions of copies of all different genes in the virus in a massively paralleled way) detects different HIV variants and has been implemented largely in high-income countries. However, there is very limited application of NGS-based HIVDR platforms in Sub-Saharan Africa which has nearly 70% of global HIV infections.</p>
<p><strong>Why HIV NGS?</strong></p>
<p>For HIV-infected individuals, comprehensive characterization of the different viral variants during initial testing before-ART initiation or during the treatment course improves their chances of survival by ensuring customized treatment while minimizing VF and HIVDR. Significant progress in HIV infection control has been realized in Sub-Saharan Africa over the last two decades largely due to increased access to ART. Advances such as second (Illumina, Roche 454, and Ion Torrent) or third-generation (PacBio and Nanopore) DNA sequencing technologies, that can accurately profile viral variants at any stage of HIV infection, are key for effective disease management, preventing VF, and HIVDR. Urgent identification of viral genetic markers that predict increased risk of VF or HIVDR in different ART-based regimens including newer ones like Dolutegravir and injectable long-acting Cabotegravir/Rilpivirine (CAB/RPV) is critical. This involves analysis of clinical alongside viral load data and viral gene variants using bioinformatics tools. The DNA sequencing technologies and advances in analytical approaches are poised to steer an era of personalized HIV management due to their ability to offer accurate rapid detection and drug resistance profiling close to point-of-care testing (also known as bedside testing).</p>

<p><strong>Virological failure and drug resistance</strong></p>
<p>Non-adherence to ART as well as poor monitoring of viral load during treatment are challenges that continue to affect HIV control programs in Africa leading to the emergence of HIVDR, virological failure, increased HIVDR transmissions, morbidity, and mortality. The WHO recommends global genomic surveillance to monitor dynamics of HIV diversity and emergence of HIVDR. Countries with high infection burden must build robust national HIV genomic surveillance programs to ensure improved management of PLWHA if they are to eradicate HIV/AIDS. ART also referred to as lifetime treatment has transformed HIV infection from a gradual, normally deadly illness to a prolonged disease that endures for many years while subjecting infected individuals to different ART treatments over time. Regular monitoring of viral load is currently used for the assessment of ART response in HIV management. The drugs cause changes in the genes of the virus. These viral gene changes can offer critical insights for understanding mechanisms of drug resistance, effects of therapeutics on the virus, and guide effective vaccine development.</p>

<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
<p>Considering that many African countries have implemented the universal HIV test and treat strategy (which involves providing lifelong ART to PLWHA irrespective of CD4 or WHO HIV clinical staging), national HIV control programs should utilize NGS in routine HIV testing, treatment, and surveillance. However, this also requires appropriate policy changes, substantial investment in installing NGS platforms and bioinformatics capacity building for infectious diseases control programs.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/quantum-particles-gravity-spacetime-aharonov-bohm-effect">Quantum particles can feel the influence of gravitational fields they never touch</a></h4>

              
                <p>If you’re superstitious, a black cat in your path is bad luck, even if you keep your distance. Likewise, in quantum physics, particles can feel the influence of magnetic fields that they never come into direct contact with. Now scientists have shown that this eerie quantum effect holds not just for magnetic fields, but for gravity too — and it’s no superstition.</p>



<p>Usually, to feel the influence of a magnetic field, a particle would have to pass through it. But in 1959, physicists Yakir Aharonov and David Bohm predicted that, in a specific scenario, the conventional wisdom would fail. A magnetic field contained within a cylindrical region can affect particles — electrons, in their example — that never enter the cylinder. In this scenario, the electrons don’t have well-defined locations, but are in “superpositions,” quantum states described by the odds of a particle materializing in two different places. Each fractured particle simultaneously takes two different paths around the magnetic cylinder. Despite never touching the electrons, and hence exerting no force on them, the magnetic field shifts the pattern of where particles are found at the end of this journey, as <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/gauging-aharonov-bohm-effect">various experiments</a> have confirmed (<em>SN: 3/1/86</em>).</p>



<p>In the new experiment, <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.abl7152">the same uncanny physics is at play for gravitational fields</a>, physicists report in the Jan. 14 <em>Science</em>. “Every time I look at this experiment, I’m like, ‘It’s amazing that nature is that way,’” says physicist Mark Kasevich of Stanford University.</p>



<p>Kasevich and colleagues launched rubidium atoms inside a 10-meter-tall vacuum chamber, hit them with lasers to put them in quantum superpositions tracing two different paths, and watched how the atoms fell. Notably, the particles weren’t in a gravitational field–free zone. Instead, the experiment was designed so that the researchers could filter out the effects of gravitational forces, laying bare the eerie Aharonov-Bohm influence.</p>





<p>The study not only reveals a famed physics effect in a new context, but also showcases the potential to study subtle effects in gravitational systems. For example, researchers aim to use this type of technique to better measure Newton’s gravitational constant, G, which reveals the <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/strength-gravity-gravitational-constant-newton">strength of gravity</a>, and is currently known less precisely than other fundamental constants of nature (<em>SN: 8/29/18</em>).</p>



<p>A phenomenon called interference is key to this experiment. In quantum physics, atoms and other particles behave like waves that can add and subtract, just as two swells merging in the ocean make a larger wave. At the end of the atoms’ flight, the scientists recombined the atoms’ two paths so their waves would interfere, then measured where the atoms arrived. The arrival locations are highly sensitive to tweaks that alter where the peaks and troughs of the waves land, known as phase shifts.</p>



<p>At the top of the vacuum chamber, the researchers placed a hunk of tungsten with a mass of 1.25 kilograms. To isolate the Aharonov-Bohm effect, the scientists performed the same experiment with and without this mass, and for two different sets of launched atoms, one which flew close to the mass, and the other lower. Each of those two sets of atoms were split into superpositions, with one path traveling closer to the mass than the other, separated by about 25 centimeters. Other sets of atoms, with superpositions split across smaller distances, rounded out the crew. Comparing how the various sets of atoms interfered, both with and without the tungsten mass, teased out a phase shift that was not due to the gravitational force. Instead, that tweak was from time dilation, a feature of Einstein’s theory of gravity, general relativity, which causes time to pass more slowly close to a massive object.</p>



<p>The two theories that underlie this experiment, general relativity and quantum mechanics, don’t work well together. Scientists don’t know how to combine them to describe reality. So, for physicists, says Guglielmo Tino of the University of Florence, who was not involved with the new study, “probing gravity with a quantum sensor, I think it’s really one of … the most important challenges at the moment.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/organic-molecules-mars-meteorite-geology-alien-life">Organic molecules in an ancient Mars meteorite formed via geology, not alien life</a></h4>

              
                <p>When researchers in 1996 reported they had found organic molecules nestled in an ancient Martian meteorite discovered in Antarctica, it caused quite a buzz. Some insisted the compounds were <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/debate-over-life-mars-rock-rekindles">big-if-true evidence of life having existed on Mars</a> (<em>SN: 3/8/01</em>). Others, though, pointed to <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/manned-mission-mars-humans-microbes-life">contamination by earthly life-forms</a> or some nonbiological origins (<em>SN: 1/10/18</em>).</p>



<p>Now, a geochemical analysis of the meteorite provides the latest buzzkill to the idea that alien life inhabited the 4.09-billion-year-old fragment of the Red Planet. It suggests instead that the <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.abg7905">organic matter within probably formed from the chemical interplay of water and minerals mingling under Mars’ surface</a>, researchers report in the Jan. 14 <em>Science</em>. Even so, the finding could aid in the search for life, the team says.</p>



<p>Organic molecules are often produced by living organisms, but they can also arise from nonbiological, abiotic processes. Though myriad hypotheses claim to explain what sparked life, many researchers consider abiotic organic molecules to be necessary starting material. Martian geologic processes could have been generating these compounds for billions of years, the new study suggests.</p>



<p>“These organic chemicals could have become the primordial soup that might have helped form life on [Mars],” says Andrew Steele, a biochemist from the Carnegie Institution for Science in Washington, D.C. Whether life ever existed there, however, remains unknown.</p>





<p>Steele and his colleagues initially sought to study how ancient Martian water may have morphed minerals in the meteorite, known as ALH84001. The team used microscopic and spectroscopic imaging methods to analyze tiny slivers from parts of the meteorite that appeared to have reacted with water.</p>



<p>In their samples, the researchers discovered by-products of two chemical reactions — serpentinization and carbonation — which occur when underground fluids interact with minerals and transform them. Amid these by-products, the researchers detected complex organic molecules. Based on the identification of these two processes, the team concluded the organics probably formed during the reactions, just as they do on Earth.</p>



<p>Analysis of the relative amounts of different types of hydrogen in the organic matter supported the notion that the organic compounds developed while on Mars; they didn’t emerge later on from Earth’s microbes or materials used in the team’s experiments.</p>



<p>Altogether the findings suggest that at least two geologic processes probably produced organic matter on the Red Planet, says Mukul Sharma, a geochemist at Dartmouth College who was not involved in the study.</p>



<p>The study is not the only to propose that organic material in Martian rocks could form without life. Researchers attributed the formation of <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/scientists-probe-fresh-martian-meteorite">complex organics in the 600-million-year-old Tissint meteorite</a>, also from Mars, to chemical interactions of water and rock (<em>SN: 10/11/12</em>).</p>



<p>However, ALH84001 is one of the oldest Martian meteorites ever found. The new findings, when considered alongside other discoveries of Martian organic matter, suggest that abiotic processes may have been generating organic material across the Red Planet for much of its history, Sharma says. “Nature has had a huge amount of time on its hands to produce this stuff.”</p>



<p>Though the work doesn’t bring us any closer to proving or disproving the existence of life on Mars, identifying abiotic sources of organic compounds there is crucial for the search, Steele explains.

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/ice-fish-nest-antarctica-breeding-colony-largest-group">The largest group of nesting fish ever found lives beneath Antarctic ice</a></h4>

              
                <p>Five hundred meters below the ice covering Antarctica’s Weddell Sea sits the world’s largest known colony of breeding fish, a new study finds.</p>



<p>An estimated 60 million active nests of a type of icefish stretch across at least 240 square kilometers, nearly the size of Orlando, Fla. Many fish create nests, from freshwater cichlids to <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/pufferfish-mysterious-crop-circles-found-near-australia">artistically inclined pufferfish</a> (<em>SN</em><em>: 10/13/20</em>). But until now, researchers have encountered only a handful of icefish nests at a time, or <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00300-021-02913-5">perhaps several dozen</a>.&nbsp;Even the most gregarious nest-building fish species were previously known to gather only in the hundreds.</p>



<p>The icefish probably have a substantial and previously unknown <a href="https://www.cell.com/current-biology/fulltext/S0960-9822(21)01698-5">influence on Antarctic food webs</a>, researchers report January 13 in <em>Current Biology</em>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Deep sea biologist Autun Purser of the Alfred Wegener Institute in Bremerhaven, Germany, and colleagues stumbled across the massive colony in early 2021 while on a research cruise in the Weddell Sea, which is located between the Antarctic Peninsula and the main continent.</p>





<p>The researchers were studying chemical connections between surface waters and the seafloor. Part of the research involved surveying seafloor life by slowly towing a device behind the scientists’ icebreaking research vessel. That device recorded video as it glides just above the bottom of the ocean and used sound to map seafloor features.&nbsp;</p>



<p>At one location on the Filchner ice shelf in the Weddell Sea, one of Purser’s colleagues was operating the camera tow and noticed that it kept encountering circular Jonah’s icefish (<em>Neopagetopsis ionah</em>) nests down below. Icefish, of the family Channichthyidae, are only found in the Southern Ocean and Antarctic waters and have <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/fish-enzyme-flexes-adapt-cold">strange adaptations to the extreme cold</a> such as clear blood full of antifreeze compounds (<em>SN: 9/19/98</em>).</p>



<p>“When I came down half an hour later and just saw nest after nest the whole four hours of the first dive, I thought we were onto something unusual,” Purser recounts.</p>



<p>Purser and colleagues made three more surveys in the area and continued to find nests at a similar density, kilometer after kilometer. Perhaps one of the closest comparisons to icefish among nest-spawning fish are bluegills (<em>Lepomis macrochirus</em>), which form breeding colonies that can have hundreds of individuals, Purser says. But based on measurements showing about one icefish nest per four square meters across hundreds of kilometers of territory, the Weddell Sea colony is several orders of magnitude larger, the researchers say. </p>

<p>The colony is an “amazing discovery,” says evolutionary biologist Thomas Desvignes of the University of Oregon in Eugene, who was not involved in the research. He was especially struck by the extreme concentration of nests.</p>



<p>“It made me think of bird nests,” Desvignes says. “When we see cormorants and other marine birds that nest like that, one next to the other — it’s almost like that.”</p>



<p>It’s not clear why so many icefish are gathering in one spot to breed. There appears to be good access to plankton in this location, which would be a crucial food source for newly hatched fish. The team also found a zone with slightly warmer water in the area, which could help the icefish locate the breeding ground.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The icefish could be sustaining Weddell seals, the researchers say. Prior studies have shown the seals spending a lot of time diving in waters above the colony area.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Purser thinks that there may be smaller Jonah’s icefish colonies closer to shore where there is less ice cover. It is possible, though, that the Jonah’s icefish disproportionately rely on the massive breeding colony, effectively putting all their eggs in one basket. If so, that “would make the species extremely vulnerable” to extinction, Desvignes says. The discovery of the massive colony is one more argument for providing environmental protections for the Weddell Sea as has been done for the nearby Ross Sea, he says.&nbsp;</p>



<p>For now, Purser currently has two seafloor cameras at the colony site, where they will remain for a couple of years, taking photos four times a day to see if the nests are reused over time.</p>



<p>“I would say [the massive colony] is almost a new seafloor ecosystem type,” Purser says. “It&#8217;s really surprising that it has never been seen before.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/second-exomoon-astronomy-exoplanet">Astronomers identified a second possible exomoon</a></h4>

              
                <p>Some of the same researchers who found the first purported exomoon now say that they’ve found another.</p>



<p>Dubbed <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41550-021-01539-1">Kepler 1708 b i</a>, the satellite has a radius about 2.6 times that of Earth, and circles a Jupiter-sized exoplanet that orbits its parent star about once every two Earth years, the team reports January 13 in <em>Nature Astronomy.</em> That sunlike star lies about 5,700 light-years from Earth.</p>



<p>To find this nugget, the team sorted through a database of more than 4,000 exoplanets detected by NASA’s now-retired Kepler space telescope. Because large planets orbiting far from their parent star are more likely to have moons large enough to be detected, the team focused on a subset of 70 exoplanets.</p>



<p>Each of these planets is between half and twice the size of Jupiter. They all either take more than 400 Earth days to orbit their star or have an estimated average surface temperature less than 300 kelvins (around 27° Celsius), slightly higher than that of Earth.</p>





<p>After further screening, including tossing out exoplanets that don’t have near-circular orbits (which are statistically less likely to host moons), the team identified a strong candidate for an exomoon. It, like its host planet, caused detectable dimming of the parent star’s light when moving across the face of the star.</p>



<p>Discovery of the first possible exomoon, dubbed Kepler 1625 b, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/skepticism-whether-first-known-exomoon-exists-kepler">has faced a lot of skepticism</a> (<em>SN: 4/30/19</em>). Both proposed exomoons need to be confirmed by further observations by other instruments, such as the <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/james-webb-space-telescope-launch-space-science-cosmos-exoplanets">recently launched James Webb Space Telescope</a>, the team notes (<em>SN: 10/6/21</em>).</p>



<p>But fresh observations will need to wait: The newfound exomoon candidate and its planet won’t pass in front of the parent star again until March 24, 2023, the researchers calculate.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2022/01/13/we-feel-more-nostalgic-as-we-get-older-but-its-not-always-a-positive-experience/">We feel more nostalgic as we get older — but it’s not always a positive experience</a></h4>

              
                <p><em>By&nbsp;</em><a href="http://emilyoliviareynolds.com/">Emily Reynolds</a></p>



<p>A song, a place, a smell&#8230; it doesn’t take much to be transported back in time. Just as with Proust and his madeleines, we all have specific memories that not only provoke nostalgia but trigger intense emotions.</p>



<p>And while nostalgia is often framed as a positive thing — a fond wistfulness — this isn’t always the case, as the University of Akron’s Jennifer R. Turner and Jennifer Tehan Stanley explore in a <a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2021-31051-001">recent paper</a> published in <em>Emotion. </em>They find that nostalgia is more common the older we get — and it can also set off both positive <em>and</em> negative feelings.</p>



<span id="more-45020"></span>



<p>Participants were 100 adults ranging in age from 18 to 78. After sharing demographic data, participants downloaded an app to their phones on which they took daily questionnaires for two weeks. Every day after receiving a prompt, they completed a measure related to nostalgia, indicating whether or not they had experienced nostalgia during the day, what they were doing at the time, and who they were with. (They were given three criteria by which to measure nostalgia: an experience that is emotional and autobiographical, during which you relive moments or &#8220;takes you back&#8221;, and that is not actively sought.) Participants then indicated how positive or negative the experience of nostalgia made them feel; those who did not record nostalgia were asked how they felt in the moment they were taking the questionnaire.</p>



<p>As expected, age was a significant predictor of daily nostalgia — young adults reported nostalgia 60% less often than middle aged adults, while older adults reported nostalgia three times more than middle aged people. Gender was not a significant predictor of nostalgia.</p>



<p>Experiencing nostalgia was related to both positive and negative changes in mood: 72% of participants reported an increase in positive affect in response to nostalgia, while 51% had an increase in negative affect. Younger and middle aged people were more likely to experience positive emotions in response to nostalgia than older people, for whom nostalgia was more related to increases in negative mood.</p>



<p>It makes sense that older people are more nostalgic — they’ve had more life experience to be nostalgic about. As to why our emotional response to nostalgia seems to shift to more negative than positive over time, the team has two suggestions. The first pertains to the way we conceptualise ourselves as we get older, remembering important moments in our lives — not all of which are likely to be positive.</p>



<p>Secondly, though nostalgia was not associated with a significant increase in positive affect among older people, there was some gain. This suggests that the benefits of remembering times past may be more ambiguous in older life, embodying the poignant nature of nostalgia.</p>



<p>Other <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2016/04/29/looking-back-on-your-past-can-make-you-less-likely-to-suffer-depression-in-the-future/">studies</a> have suggested that purposefully looking back on your past can make you less likely to suffer depression, providing &#8220;sense, meaning and ways of thinking to free the individual from feelings of joylessness or despair&#8221;. For those finding the pangs of nostalgia more bitter than sweet, this conscious effort to remember may be a way of reframing a complex yet common emotion.</p>

<p>JD: There is growing support for the idea that knowledge production and dissemination should be more inclusive. How we actually operationalize that ideal is the challenge that PLOS is tackling, and I&rsquo;m excited by the opportunity to both learn from and support those efforts.</p>

<p><strong>What specific expertise do you bring to PLOS Water?</strong></p>



<p> JD: I&rsquo;ve been teaching and carrying out research in the water and sanitation field for more than 20 years. Most of my group&rsquo;s work has been in countries in Africa, Asia, and Latin America. Having the opportunity to examine issues across a variety of contexts has really shaped the way I think about research design and the interpretation of findings </p>

          <p>PH: My earliest training was in aquatic zoology; I&rsquo;ve developed a strong interest in the variety of inland aquatic ecosystems, including water chemistry and water resource management. My research is increasingly focused on social ecology, place-based, and policy dimensions of our interactions with water.</p>

<p><strong>What is the most exciting part of your job as an Editor-in-Chief?</strong><br><br>PH: Most of us are aware of the challenges we face in terms of planetary resources and inequality, and the inadequacies of our existing institutions to tackle them meaningfully.  Since journals are institutions that structure the delivery of knowledges, we have both responsibilities and opportunities in this regard. The most exciting part of my job as Co-Editor-in-Chief is to be equally attentive to each of these many ways of knowing. Sometimes that will involve challenging our societal and organisational structures.<br><br>JD: Working with my Co-EIC Pierre Horwitz to develop a vision for PLOS Water that catalyzes cross talk between the water services and water resources communities, and that supports historically under-represented researchers in publishing their work. I&rsquo;ve also loved meeting new colleagues and learning about their work&ndash;there is an amazing amount of scholarship in the water field!<br><br><strong>What will PLOS Water add to the field in the coming decade?</strong><br><br>PH: Water permeates, and is nearly universal in a disciplinary sense. The combined forces of industrialisation and population growth have meant a flourishing of types of water knowledge that belong, more often than not, to a set of languages and technologies. While they are essential coverage for the field of water, they have come at the expense of a diverse array of water knowledges that have been marginalised, and are more place-based, culturally defined, and ecologically literate. They include knowledges of Indigenous and local peoples, even formed over thousands of years and hundreds of generations, embedding understandings of water as the world has changed, and how societies have responded.<br><br>By addressing this imbalance, and providing a re-acquaintance for an international audience, while maintaining strong coverage of conventional and emerging fields, we may well be in a better position to contribute to a regenerative global agenda over the next ten years.<br><br><strong>What&rsquo;s a common misconception new authors have about the peer review or publication process?</strong><br><br>JD: I think some new authors may forget that reviewers, while very knowledgeable and typically more seasoned than they, are also colleagues in their scholarly community. Engaging them in constructive debate can benefit everyone.<br><br><strong>What developments are occurring in your field of expertise that excite you at this time?<br></strong><br>JD: First, increased data availability and advances in data science are expanding opportunities for measuring and monitoring water resources, services, and access. Ideally this will enable better management and policy choices. I&rsquo;m also excited to see a broader conception of health being incorporated into the water services arena. Evaluating effects of service deficits on, for example, mental health and the quality of child caregiving helps paint a more complete picture of the costs and benefits of water sector investments.<br><br>Want to know more about the journal and how to submit your research?

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/homo-sapiens-human-bones-ethiopia-omo-africa-older">Homo sapiens bones in East Africa are at least 36,000 years older than once thought</a></h4>

              
                <p>Fossils from the oldest known <em>Homo sapiens</em> individual in East Africa are more ancient than previously thought.</p>



<p>A partial <em>H. sapiens</em> skull and associated skeletal parts found in 1967 in the Kibish rock formation along Ethiopia’s Omo River date to at least around 233,000 years ago, pushing back the age of the fossils by 36,000 years or more. An age well exceeding 200,000 years for the Ethiopian fossils, known as Omo 1, fits with recent fossil discoveries suggesting that <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/oldest-known-homo-sapiens-fossils-come-northern-africa-studies-claim"><em>H. sapiens</em> evolved across Africa starting roughly 300,000 years ago</a> (<em>SN: 6/7/17</em>).</p>



<p>A volcanic eruption about 233,000 years ago left a layer of ash atop the sediment that yielded the Omo <em>H. sapiens</em> fossils, say volcanologist Céline Vidal of the University of Cambridge and colleagues. That ash layer displayed a chemical fingerprint matching that of a volcanic crater located 350 kilometers northeast of the fossil site. A massive eruption there spewed volcanic ash that wafted to Omo, the researchers say. Dating of hardened ash at the volcanic crater <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-021-04275-8">led to the new age estimate</a> for the human fossils, the scientists report January 12 in <em>Nature</em>.</p>



<p>Another Omo ash layer lying near the fossil-bearing sediment, but with uncertain origins, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/human-fossils-are-oldest-yet">had already been dated to about 197,000 years ago</a>, providing the previous age estimate (<em>SN: 2/22/05</em>). All sediment ages rely on measures of the decay of a radioactive form of the element argon.</p>



<p>Further work will examine whether ash layers below Omo’s fossil-ceding sediment resulted from earlier volcanic blasts. “If successful, we might be able to bracket Omo 1 with a maximum age,” Vidal says.</p>
