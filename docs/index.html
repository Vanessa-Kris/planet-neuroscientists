<p>"Our previous analysis  (10.5281/zenodo.1133759 and 10.7287/peerj.preprints.3520v1) looked at OA classification as included in Web of Science (gold and green OA, based on Unpaywall data), and supplemented that with a breakdown of gold OA into pure gold, hybrid and bronze, taken from Unpaywall data (formerly OADOI) directly. Here, we improve on this by running all DOIs retrieved from WoS through Unpaywall data (using their web interface that allows batch checking of up to 10,000 DOIs at a time). Unlike WoS, Unpaywall data itself includes author-submitted versions in their green OA classification, resulting in more complete green OA levels."</p>

<p>"Arts and humanities scholars are mostly unaware of the preprint revolution that has swept through academia in recent decades, even as they already take part in it. This particular ignorance is mostly a blissful one, however, demonstrating the near absence of certain types of pressure (“priority of discovery”) that pervade the natural, exact and even social sciences. But our lack of mobilization to create public preprint services in our fields is problematic in other respects, and it is precisely the longer breath that we can afford to take which positions us uniquely to benefit ourselves, fellow scholars and the public at large. Before describing how we can do so (and what we’ve been doing wrong), a few words about the concept and practice of preprints."</p>

A paper in Psychological Science was taking a beating on Twitter last month.

In this post, I'm not going to talk about the paper itself but rather, about how it came to be published and how preregistration - a concept I have long advocated - may be being misused.

The paper reports on five studies which all address the same general question. Of these, Study #3 was preregistered and the authors write that it was performed after

Here’s a story that shows the lengths a public university — The University of Illinois at Chicago — went to block the release of information about a child psychiatry trial gone wrong, and how a reporter — Jodi S. Cohen of ProPublica — fought them effectively at every turn to reveal the truth.

<p>"It’s the final day of OHBM 2018, and I’m tired. I’m also excited, enthusiastic and exhilarated. I’ve had my first real taste of the Open Science community, and I want more! What follows is an honest account of how I went from feelings of scepticism and ambivalence about Open Science, to a flag waving advocate. My hope is that you might read my story and find it in some way relatable. Then maybe, just maybe, you’ll join me in the Open Science Room next year."</p>

Sounds good but what does Open Science (OS) mean in a practical sense? These courses answer some of the most common questions you might have about putting open science into practice. Each course takes about 1-2 hours to work through and you’ll receive a badge upon completion. The courses include practical tips on getting started with OS as well as providing information on discipline specific tools and resources you can use.

<p>"Openness is good for research. But equality is better. So far, the two don’t always align and we urgently need to change that. The current system of scholarly communication is a false meritocracy; it's profoundly inequal in that many decisions aren't based on ability and accomplishment. Against our intentions, much of the current approach to openness doesn’t alleviate this inequality. The most pressing problem here is what the hermetic discussions on openness didn’t manage to achieve: rid scholarly communication of an exploitative commercial agenda that holds both research and higher education in a tight grip."</p>

<p>"Its implementation is, however, not yet universal. A revolution is required: one which opens up research processes and changes mindsets in favour of a world where policies, tools and infrastructures universally support the growth and sharing of knowledge. Research libraries are well placed to make that revolution happen and LIBER, as Europe’s largest network of research libraries, wants to support them in that endeavour. That’s why LIBER has written an Open Science Roadmap outlining the specific actions libraries can take to champion Open Science, both within and beyond their own institutions."</p>

<p>"The call for academy-owned open access (OA) journals is getting louder. Today, more scholars and institutions are launching and supporting academic-led journals in order to introduce alternatives to subscription journals and create competition to force down OA article processing charges, which corporate publishers have been increasing upwards of 6% a year. The transition to online publishing is making it easier than ever for members of the academic community to start journals and even flip subscription titles to academy-owned OA models, and they’re showing that they can publish at a fraction of the cost of their corporate counterparts."</p>

New evidence suggests the original experiment was also a form of theatre.</figure>
<p><em>By</em> <a href="http://www.psychologywriter.org.uk/">Christian Jarrett</a></p>
<p>What leads some people to tyrannise others, as when guards abuse their prisoners? The US psychologist Philip Zimbardo would say it’s the corrupting power of the situation. Infamously, in the summer of 1971, his prison simulation study had to be abandoned when some of the volunteers playing the role of guards began mistreating the volunteers acting as prisoners.</p>
<p>The shock value of the aborted study derives in large part from the idea that the mock prison took on a life of its own; that otherwise “ordinary” folk began behaving in abhorrent ways simply because they’d been assigned a role with particular connotations. As Zimbardo put it, the guards’ brutality occurred “as a natural consequence of being in the uniform of a ‘guard'”.</p>
<p>But not everyone buys this account. Critics of the Stanford Prison Experiment have long claimed that Zimbardo and his colleagues did not merely observe, but actively participated in the events that unfolded.</p>
<p>Now a team led by Alex Haslam at the University of Queensland has analysed a recently released recording of a conversation between one of the volunteer guards and Zimbardo’s collaborator David Jaffe, who acted as prison warden for the study. The findings of their analysis, <a href="https://psyarxiv.com/b7crx/">released as a pre-print at PsyArXiv</a>, suggest that one of psychology’s most famous studies was not so much an experiment but more a form of theatre. “We can no longer airbrush out the role of the experimenters in producing brutality,” write Haslam et al.</p>
<p><span id="more-34147"></span></p>
<p>The conversation, <a href="http://purl.stanford.edu/wn708sg0050">available for anyone to listen to online</a> (starts from 8.38), is 18-minutes long and features Jaffe attempting to persuade the “guard” John Mark to behave more like a stereotypical tough guard, a role he is clearly reluctant to take on.</p>
<p>Haslam and his colleagues analysed the interaction specifically looking for evidence of whether Jaffe engaged in “identity leadership”, which is characterised by the leader creating a shared sense of identity (a “them” and “us” mentality) and painting the required behavior of the in-group (the “us”) as worthy and virtuous and beneficial to the in-group.</p>
<p>The researchers found multiple examples of Jaffe engaging in precisely these kind of leadership tactics – for instance, he uses the collective “we” 57 times in the conversation (or once every 30 words); he argues that the entire endeavor will fall apart unless Mark and the other volunteer guards behave as required; and he portrays this shared endeavour as worthy, as a way to increase the chance of real-life prison reform.</p>
<p>Indisputably, Jaffe does not sit back and allow Mark to choose freely how to behave in his assigned role of guard: “… [W]e really want to get you active and involved because the Guards have to know that every Guard is going to be what we call a tough Guard,” he tells Mark.</p>
<p>The newly analysed recording, together with earlier video footage of Zimbardo acting as “prison superintendent” and briefing the guards on what was expected of them, contradict the way that Zimbardo has portrayed the experiment, as if the unsettling events unfolded by themselves. It seems more accurate to view the Stanford Prison Experiment as a compelling example of semi-scripted improvised theatre rather than as objective scientific research. Hopefully such an interpretation will find its way through to our introductory textbooks, <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2014/07/23/what-the-textbooks-dont-tell-you-one-of-psychologys-most-famous-experiments-was-seriously-flawed/">many of which present only Zimbardo’s account of what happened</a>.</p>
<p>But still, it remains the case that some of the volunteers assigned to the role of guards went way beyond the script, engaging in such cruel behaviour as forcing the “prisoners” to clean out toilets with their hands. How satisfactory is the social identity account that Haslam and his co-authors put forward as an explanation for why some of the guards resisted engaging in tyranny, while others willingly went way beyond Zimbardo and his colleagues’ expectations, not just acting tough, but engaging in depravity?</p>
<p>Haslam and his colleagues admit that to claim, on the basis of the new evidence, that identity leadership was responsible for the guards’ brutality “would be to go too far”.</p>
<p>Even while recognising the important influence of Zimbardo and his colleagues on the events that took place at Stanford (and why it was so persuasive), many will remain appalled by the sadism on display, and crave a deeper explanation for the darkness that resides within seemingly ordinary people. As science writer and sceptic Michael Shermer <a href="https://twitter.com/michaelshermer/status/1012005792164274177">wrote on Twitter</a> in response to these new findings and wider criticisms of the Stanford Prison Experiment, “The fact remains that the potential for evil lies in our nature given the right circumstances.”</p>

<img alt="" class="attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image" height="110" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2018/06/DSC_0714-e1530177552947-140x110.jpg" style="display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;" width="140" /><p>Universal health coverage (UHC) is a situation where every person irrespective of where they live and their socioeconomic status, have access to good quality health services without having to go through any financial hardship.</p>
<p>It has three key elements, namely: equity in access to healthcare in terms of geographic coverage and the range of available health services, health services which are of high quality, and financial protection against any hardship to users of health services which may be arise as a result of out-of-pocket payments.</p>
<p>UHC is central to the principles of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) of leaving no one behind. Its benefit goes beyond ensuring good health for populations; it also contributes to reduction in poverty, gender equity, social economic growth, and human capital development of any society.</p>
<blockquote><p>In my opinion, UHC is not a privilege but a right for all African citizens.</p></blockquote>
<p>In my opinion, UHC is not a privilege but a right for all African citizens. However, to many people, it may appear to be an ambitious target which would be difficult to achieve by many African countries.</p>
<p>Of course, as a public health physician with extensive working experience in Africa, I have witnessed first-hand the challenges in attaining UHC such as inadequate human resources for health, weak medicines supply chain management systems, inadequate and unsustainable financing of health services, and recurrent disasters which weakens health systems.</p>
<p>The high levels of poverty; poor status of the social; economic and environmental determinants of health; and the fact that a sizable majority of African citizens work in the informal sectors, making it difficult for them to participate in social protection and health insurance schemes, further compound the problem.</p>
<h3><strong>Achieving universal health coverage</strong></h3>
<p>Despite these challenges, I do strongly believe that attainment of UHC is a feasible aspiration which should be vigorously pursued by all African countries. The lessons learnt from implementation of the <a href="http://www.un.org/en/development/desa/policy/wess/wess_archive/2015wess_full_en.pdf">Millennium Development Goals (MDGs)</a> have shown that with strong political commitment and good governance, African countries could overcome the adversities which stand between them and UHC.</p>
<p>There are very good examples such as Rwanda; a country which was able to transform itself against all odds from the tragic events of 1994 to achieve all the health related MDGs. This enviable achievement was made possible by political commitment to health, good governance, accountable leadership, self-determination and use of innovations including a well acclaimed community-based health insurance program which covers more than 85% of its target population.</p>
<p>Similar but tailor-made methods could be used by other African countries to deploy innovative, cost-effective and context specific strategies and appropriate technologies to ensure sustainable financing of healthcare services, extension of health services to the populations which are underserved and to expand the range of health services.</p>
<blockquote><p>The call-to-action which was the final outcome of the forum called on African political leaders and public health policy makers to increase political commitment and domestic investments in health.</p></blockquote>
<p>It is therefore instructive that the first ever Africa Health Forum took place in Kigali Rwanda in June 2017. The forum in which I actively participated as an organizer and participant was convened to brainstorm on the key challenges and ways to fast track attainment of UHC in Africa and to galvanize commitment of African political leaders, civil society and the private sector to UHC and health SDG agenda.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://bmcproc.biomedcentral.com/articles/supplements/volume-12-supplement-7">report of the forum</a>, published in <em>BMC Proceedings</em>, provides insights into how UHC can be achieved in Africa. The participants and discussants at the forum proposed the use of evidence-based methods to advocate for sustainable domestic financing of health care services, institution of mandatory social protection and prepaid health insurance, and doubling of the efforts to generate good quality public health data.</p>
<p>The forum further identified increased private sector engagement in health services delivery and financing, strengthened partnerships, improved intersectoral collaborations and the use of south-south cooperation mechanisms as critical tools for fast tracking attainment of UHC on the continent.</p>
<p>The call-to-action which was the final outcome of the forum called on African political leaders and public health policy makers to increase political commitment and domestic investments in health and to fast track deployment of new technologies, including digital health solutions to support the attainment of UHC.</p>
<p>In conclusion, UHC should be viewed as a high yield investment which would ultimately translate into a healthier and productive population which will in turn transform Africa socioeconomically thus its attainment should not be negotiable. Looking forward, use of innovative approaches and evidence are needed to boost the attainment of UHC on the continent.</p>

The victims were all attendees at a seminar on spiritual healing called 'Die sieben Quellen' - "The Seven Springs".

<p>Our world is getting smaller and we are all getting farther apart.</p>
<p>No, this isn’t a prelude to a discussion on how technology has turned us into antisocial zombies. On the contrary, in an increasingly connected world each of us has more opportunities to work in, travel to, and meet people from different places around the globe than ever before. This means there are that many more of us <a href="http://brainblogger.com/2015/02/08/how-do-i-love-thee-let-me-examine-my-brain/">falling in love</a> with people who live far away from us—in different cities, countries, continents and, maybe one day, planets?</p>
<p>Alternatively, some of us have fallen in love with the girl/boy next door only to find ourselves separated from the love of our lives due to their/our work commitments. In any case, few of us are strangers to being a partner in a long-distance relationship (LDR).</p>
<p>While there is a healthy amount of research that looks into how couples communicate with each other within a relationship, there is, surprisingly, not that much about how couples in long-distance relationships keep the flame burning. </p>
<p>For many of us, LDRs are a ‘test’ to see how strong a relationship is and if it can sustain itself in the face of adversity. Sure, there was a time when the only means couples in an LDR had to stay in touch was through fortnightly letters written by hand or expensive phone calls with unclear network reception. But today, with a spectrum of communication mediums literally at our fingertips, this ‘test’ is not nearly as challenging as it once was.</p>
<p>In a study conducted by Hampton et al. (2018) the authors set out to find out which mediums were used the most by couples in LDRs and which were the most effective at maintaining relationship satisfaction. They had a straightforward hypothesis: couples in LDRs who communicated with each other more frequently would report greater relationship satisfaction. To this hypothesis they added a caveat: not all means of communication are created equal, and some, such as Skype, may be more <a href="http://brainblogger.com/2016/01/30/what-keeps-couples-together-for-the-duration/">beneficial to relationships</a> than others. </p>
<p>The researchers surveyed 588 participants in LDRs that asked them questions about how frequently they used different kinds of communication, how satisfied they were with the communication in their relationship, and how satisfied they were with their relationship overall. </p>
<p>Perhaps unsurprisingly, text messages were the most frequently used means of communication in LDRs. However, Skype was the only communication medium where the researchers could discern association with relationship satisfaction. Partners who spent more time video chatting via Skype did indeed report greater levels of satisfaction with their relationship. When it came to communication satisfaction, it was the use of Skype as well as picture messaging that came out on top. As for <a href="http://brainblogger.com/2018/04/09/the-effects-facebook-breaks-and-on-stress-and-well-being/">Facebook</a>, Twitter, and Snapchat? They had close to no impact on either relationship or communication satisfaction. In fact, Facebook use was associated with <i>lower</i> levels of relationship satisfaction. That’s something worth thinking about. </p>
<p>What <i>is</i> surprising about this study is that the humble telephone call displayed little to no relation with communication satisfaction or relationship satisfaction, quite unlike its video counterpart, Skype, revealing that being able to see your partner is a core component to maintaining a healthy relationship even when apart.</p>
<p>Based on this study, it seems clear that a mode of communication that involves a visual component—as Skype and picture messaging do—is an effective indicator of relationship satisfaction. The researchers suggest this is due to the presence of non-verbal as well as audio cues resulting in greater communication satisfaction and thereby more satisfaction with the relationship overall. So if you’re in an LDR, the more you talk to your partner over Skype (with the camera on), the more satisfied you will be with your relationship. Then again, if you’re in an LDR, you probably already knew that. </p>

<h4>How your brain works out when to be afraid</h4><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/283/1*OWLsoWTmDPRvl5wfV9QHiw.jpeg" /></figure><p>At what point do you turn tail and flee? A shadow falls across you. A shadow of a large man. A close man, panting heavily. A shadow of a large, close, panting man dressed as a clown. Carrying rusty garden shears. A shadow of a large close panting man dressed as a clown carrying rusty garden shears with a cardboard box tucked under one arm. That’s dripping. Dripping a thick, red ooze.</p><p>Time to leg it, n’est pas?</p><p>Dave the Party Clown stares after you, bewildered, stows his novelty-sized balloon scissors, and sprints off once more to find the kids’ party, stressing that the strawberry ice-creams are melting fast.</p><p>Each new thing you noticed about Dave increased your sense of danger, added more evidence of an imminent threat. And when enough evidence had been gathered, when the cumulative creeping sensation got too much, your brain decided the threat was real — and escape was the best course of action. Flee!</p><p><a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-018-0244-6?WT.feed_name=subjects_synaptic-transmission">New work by Tiago Branco and his team</a> — including Dominic Evans and Vanessa Stempel — has now shown us exactly how the brain makes this decision. And at its heart is a brilliant move by evolution to turn a bug of biology — a failure — into a feature.</p><p>From your experience with Dave, you now know that somewhere in your brain adds up evidence of a threat, and somewhere then sets a threshold for when enough evidence means “now run like buggery”.</p><p>To find out where, we can’t sit people in a room and menace them with clowns. And even if we were allowed to, we can’t stick electrodes inside their brains to record their neurons while being clown-menaced. So Branco and team turned to that workhorse of neuroscience, the mouse.</p><p>Place a mouse in a box, with a handy little dark shelter at one end to feel safe in. Let it roam free, exploring, scouting its new home. Now make a shadow fall over it, a shadow that rapidly grows in size. A rapidly growing shadow that looks uncannily like a diving bird. Result: mouse tears back to the shelter, and cowers deep in the darkness, little heart thudding.</p><p>The clever bit is that the darkness of shadow is the evidence of an imminent threat: the darker the shadow, the greater the perceived threat. If the shadow is very dark, the mouse runs as soon as it starts to get bigger. If the shadow is very light, it can take four or five repeats of the swooping shadow for the mouse to finally decide to run for shelter.</p><p>With this swooping shadow controlling both evidence and escape, we can then look in the brain and ask: what adds up the evidence of a swooping shadow, and what drives “leg it” when that evidence hits a threshold? Branco and team already had clues about where to start: for we already know that it should somehow involve the superior colliculus.</p><p>The superior colliculus sits atop the brainstem, and is the privileged recipient of information directly from the retina — it gets to know what’s going on in the world long before you do. (Before you ask: yes, there is also an “inferior” colliculus. And as the superior colliculus does seeing, and the inferior does hearing, that gives you some idea of the pecking order in neuroscience). And the output of the superior colliculus <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0896627308007691?via%3Dihub">definitely controls movement</a>. So if we’re looking for a bit of brain that can quickly add up information from the eyes and then make you move, the superior colliculus is the superior candidate. <br /> <br />So Branco and team used the armoury of modern neuroscience to find out if this was more than mere guesswork.</p><p>They switched off the output neurons of the superior colliculus. Now the mouse did not react to the swooping shadow. Just carried on exploring. As though someone had completely removed its threat detector.</p><p>They recorded the activity of the output neurons. The neurons dramatically increased their activity right from the start of the swooping shadow. The activity increased far more when escape happened than when it didn’t. And the stronger the activity, the faster the mouse started to escape. As though the activity in superior colliculus was adding up evidence of a threat.</p><p>They turned on these output neurons of the superior colliculus, when there was no swooping shadow. This is the crucial test, to see if the brain can be fooled into thinking there was an imminent threat. And it could: turning on these neurons made the mouse run for shelter. Even better, the more the neurons were activated, the more likely the mouse ran to the shelter, exactly as though the neurons were signalling the imminence of danger.</p><p>All in all, pretty damn convincing that the superior colliculus is the threat detector. The obvious next question was: what is the superior colliculus talking to, saying “it’s time to run”?</p><p>Enter the Periaqueductal Gray. Good grief neuroscientists are so bad at names: it’s a bit of grey stuff around (‘peri’) an aqueduct in the brain. Let’s call it PeGy, shall we? PeGy does a lot of things. One bit of it controls taking a piss, for example. But it gets a massive input from the superior colliculus, and it controls a lot of rapid reactions.</p><p>So Branco and team dusted off their neuroscience magic tricks again, popped some new mice in the swooping-shadow box, and set to work.</p><p>They turned off PeGy’s neurons. Now the mice did see the swooping shadow, did react to the threat. But they didn’t run away. At all. They just froze in place (the other option: stop moving, as predator brains track movement). PeGy, it seems, controls running away.</p><p>They recorded PeGy’s neurons. Their activity increased right as the escape started, and not a moment before. So PeGy’s neurons don’t add up evidence, but sure seem to mean “run”.</p><p>And the clincher: they turned on PeGy’s neurons when no shadow was swooping, again pretending there was a threat. Beautifully, as they activated more and more neurons, they found an all-or-nothing response. If too few neurons were activated, the mouse never ran for shelter. But if just enough neurons were activated, the mouse always ran for shelter. Nothing in between — no ifs, buts, or maybes. When PeGy says go, you go.</p><p>That all-or-nothing response raises the crucial question: what sets that threshold between escaping or not? It’s definitely something between the colliculus and PeGy, for when Branco and team turned off just that connection it turned off escaping completely. It seems the superior colliculus activity goes straight into PeGy’s neurons to turn evidence of a threat into running away. So why doesn’t every increase in superior colliculus activity trigger PeGy’s command to run away?</p><p>Because it turns out the connections from the superior colliculus to PeGy are weak, and rubbish. The activity of one neuron is carried to its targets by little spikes of electricity. Each spike barrelling down from one colliculus neuron into PeGy — and there are a lot of these spikes — creates just a tiny blip in the PeGy neuron. And it would need tens or hundreds of these blips to make a PeGy neuron output just one spike. Each connection is weak.</p><p>If it does anything at all. On average, 20% of all spikes from the colliculus do nothing at all in PeGy. The spike gets to the end and — zip, nada, niente. No response at all in the PeGy neuron. Each connection is rubbish: spikes can just fail.</p><p>A weak, rubbish connection means that the colliculus needs to send a lot of spikes, all at the same time, to get a response out of PeGy. The weak, rubbishness is the threshold. Those light swooping shadows, each eliciting just a bit of activity from the colliculus, did not create enough activity to overcome the weak rubbishness of the connection to PeGy. But the dark, intense shadows drove a wave of intense activity out of colliculus into PeGy, overwhelmed the weak rubbishness — and escape was the only option.</p><p>This work has two particularly beautiful lessons for those who study the brain. The first is that we have a complex behaviour — escaping by running to a shelter — now drilled down to a single connection in the brain, and the properties of that specific connection. For that connection <strong>is</strong> the threshold: its weakness and unreliability set the threshold — they are the limits to overcome.</p><p>The second is that the rubbishness of the connections between neurons — the failure of spikes — is well known. Spike failure is seen all over the brain, and causes much head-scratching. Spikes cost a lot of energy to make and send. So why send them if they’re just going to fail? It seems failure may be an inevitable bug of biology, a price to pay for sending spikes.</p><p>But here this bug is a feature. Evolution has co-opted the failure of spikes to create a threshold between escaping and not escaping. Has used the failure of spikes as a way to filter out things that are not threatening, to make sure you don’t run away at every sudden noise, or every looming shadow.</p><p>Or perhaps you do. For if the failure of this connection is the threshold between staying or fleeing, then perhaps it defines how afraid you are, how much threat you can tolerate before you flee. For if in your brain this connection is working just fine, if it is not failing badly, then you’d flee at the drop of a pin. So the nervous, rejoice: your brain is perhaps just too perfect.</p><p><em>Want more?

<p>A number of notable figures from psychology’s past held an interest in parapsychology or psi (the study of mental phenomena that defy current scientific understanding), including William James, Alexander Luria, Binet, Freud, and Fechner. But today the field is cordoned off; and when it encroaches into mainstream publications, as with the “<a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2010/11/12/dramatic-study-shows-participants-are-affected-by-psychological-phenomena-from-the-future/">Feeling the Future</a>” experiments conducted by Daryl Bem in 2012, furore typically follows. To sceptics, the fact that these experiments produced positive results is <i>ipso facto</i> proof <a href="https://slate.com/health-and-science/2017/06/daryl-bem-proved-esp-is-real-showed-science-is-broken.html">that psychology’s methods</a> <a href="http://osc.centerforopenscience.org/2014/06/25/a-skeptics-review/">must be broken</a>.</p>
<p>However, it’s only logical to take this view if you have already ruled out the existence of psychic phenomena and, at least among the US public, <a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/16915/three-four-americans-believe-paranormal.aspx">the majority haven’t</a>.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Even in the chronically suspicious British culture, one quarter of people <a href="https://yougov.co.uk/news/2011/10/05/do-you-believe-psychics/">have consulted a psychic</a>. I too am personally quite open to the existence of such phenomena, so I’ve been eager for an accessible overview of the field of parapsychology as it currently stands. This is what parapsychology researcher Etzel Cardeña, Director of the Centre for Research on Consciousness and Anomalous Psychology at Lund University, attempts to provide in his <a href="http://psycnet.apa.org/record/2018-24699-001">new review</a> in <i>American Psychologist.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></i></p>
<p><span id="more-34118"></span></p>
<p>One of the main areas that Cardeña focuses on is “anomalous cognition”, which involves coming to know something without using the normal senses. Cardeña cites a pair of meta-analyses combining previous data that involved a forced-choice procedure popular in the middle of the last century (imagine a set up similar to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ohlA__xABw">Peter Venkman’s experiment in Ghostbusters</a> where he asked participants to guess which of a series of symbols was printed on a concealed card). The meta-analyses indicate consistently small but significant effects (around .02) – that is, participants were able to detect the correct answer better than if they had been guessing.</p>
<p>Related, but new to me, are so-called “hidden reward” experiments. In one example, participants choose from an array of kanji characters (Japanese writing using Chinese letters) the one they prefer aesthetically, unaware that choosing a certain character will produce benefits for their partner in another room. Cardeña cites a review that suggestst participants tend towards the characters that help out their partner.</p>
<p>These forced-choice approaches are still used, but the psi research community has turned more enthusiasm towards a free-response technique called the “<a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2007/10/15/how-experimenters-influenced-participants-in-the-ganzfeld-parapsychology-experiment/">Ganzfeld procedure</a>”. Blindfolded participants in a soundproofed room say what comes into their mind in an attempt to describe a film clip that they have not seen (they are either shown it later, or it may be playing simultaneously in another location). If judges can use these descriptions to pick between this clip and other distractor clips, this is used as evidence that the participant detected information about the clip without using their physical senses. Meta-analyses of the field suggest a statistically significant effect of about .14 to .15. Some critics have suggested that the effect size goes down when lower quality studies are excluded, but others contend that the opposite is true, with the best studies showing the strongest evidence. Either way, the effects are strikingly larger for selected participants – those who were familiar with the studies or who were chosen because they had traits previously associated with stronger psi effects, such self-efficacy, extraversion and openness-to-experience.</p>
<p>A similar pattern is found in remote viewing, an analogous procedure where a sender attempts to provide information about where they are to a participant located elsewhere.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Similar to Bem’s controversial “Feeling the Future” experiments, Cardeña also reviews findings from “presentiment studies”, where effects are looked for prior to an event, such as skin conductance changes before seeing emotionally-charged images. Here there is a significant effect size across 26 data sets, with the higher quality studies having larger effects than the lower quality ones.</p>
<p>Another field of psi research considers psychokinesis, which is mental action altering physical objects without the “normal” mechanism of thought affecting the body first. This is typically investigated using subtle changes, such as influencing the fall of a dice or perturbing the action of a random number generator. While meta-analyses suggest significant effects, these are generally flimsier than those in the area of anomalous cognition: smaller and less robust – for example, some show clusters of significant findings near <em>p</em>=.05, which researchers now use as a marker of questionable research practices. The research into non-contact healing effects also suffers from these criticisms and is additionally hard to shield from potential placebo influences.</p>
<p>Cardeña concludes that “overall the meta-analyses have been supportive of the psi hypothesis” (i.e. indicating that anomalous effects are real), with the strongest findings for free-response experiments on anomalous cognition like the Ganzfeld work, and weaker for forced-choice designs and work in the psychokinesis sub-field. On this basis, it is arguable that, as much as any other field of psychology, there is at least something meriting investigation.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>But psi isn’t any other field of psychology. Because of its claims, it is understandably held to high standards and many dismiss the findings as being due to poor quality methods. In fact this scrutiny has forced psi research to be ahead of the game on many research practices. It pioneered randomisation with masking (concealing group allocation from participants and researchers, to reduce bias); produced some of the earliest meta-analytical work; and has been preregistering studies for over forty years. Cardeña also argues that, rare for psychology, this is a field in which non-replications are incentivised.</p>
<p>However, even if there is solid supporting evidence, sceptics allege the endeavour is fundamentally ascientific because there are no mechanisms or models to understand the putative effects. To address this criticism, Cardeña lays out the model most psi researchers ground their work in, which<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>centres on three concepts well-established in physics. The first is “non-locality” – while science tends to focus on demonstrating direct cause and effect – one billiard ball striking another – quantum mechanics (QM) shows evidence of “spooky” action at a distance, raising the possibility that all things are in some way fundamentally entangled.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>The second idea is that objects are in themselves not fully determined, but remain as probability functions until they are measured by a sentient observer. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>The third idea relates to the post-Einsteinian notion that events in the future of a slow-moving individual may have already happened to a faster moving one. Some theories account for such issues by positing that all times co-exist simultaneously. Cardeña gives the example that measuring the spin of a particle appears “to retroactively determine the spin of a delayed photon entangled with it.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>These three ideas add up to an interpretation in which objective matter and subjective perspective are not firmly separate, but interlace, where reality may be (mostly) experienced in a sequential temporal fashion but is in some sense simultaneous or eternal. These ideas are absent from certain influential modern world views such as Marxism and positivism, and they understandably clash with the causal metaphors that most people – especially the scientifically minded – use to organise their experience. But it’s worth remembering that they are preeminent historically in almost every philosophical and folk tradition across the world, including tallying with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Idealism">idealism</a>, in which mind is primary to the material (idealism can also accommodate <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Unreality_of_Time">counterintuitive takes on time</a>).<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>But yet another criticism is that if psi effects are real, why aren’t we all Professor Xs with amazing telepathy and why are the effects so small? Well, the fact that something exists doesn’t mean it needs to operate like in the movies.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>It makes sense for our fragile bodies to be organised to mainly respond to sensory and bodily stimuli – hearing or seeing something new or threatening should always win in the battle for attention, potentially masking psi effects most of the time.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>The small effects found in studies may also reflect the fact that the stakes are especially low – far lower than the situations in which people spontaneously report such experiences, such as around the sudden sickness or death of a loved one. The effect sizes also reflect the average of all people, and the studies seem to show that subsets of individuals are more receptive to psi experiences, producing much higher effects when they alone are tested.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  C</span>ardeña also points out that some of the psi meta-analysis effect sizes approach those found in social psychology research, and are larger than for some evidence-based practices such as using aspirin for heart conditions.</p>
<p>Cardeña concludes that psi has vertical and horizontal support: “vertical” meaning that different protocols have provided consistent effects over years or decades of investigation, even as protocols have become more rigorous; and “horizontal” meaning a pattern of results across different areas (e.g. similar profiles of people who perform better at tasks). According to researcher Dean Radin, findings from parapsychology suggest “that there is some way that humans are connected with the rest of reality in non-local ways.” Should psychology and funding bodies be paying more attention?<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

<p style="font-weight: bold;">The Goalkeeper Game, a tool for massive data collection and experiments</p>
<p style="font-size: 15px;">NeuroMat's Goalkeeper Game has evolved as two concomitant research, development directions. Firstly, the game, that had a first version launched in early 2016, is being developed as a tool for massive data collection. Secondly, the game remains a resource for efficient diagnosis and allows for changes in settings for experiments. Challenges in these two directions have been advanced by a multidisciplinary team within NeuroMat's innovation area.

<p>When you’re in the middle of a gruelling long-distance run and the pain and fatigue is becoming overwhelming, an obvious strategy is to try to force the subjective experience out of your mind, for example by thinking nice thoughts or focusing on the environment around you. The trouble is, as the physical struggle intensifies, the distraction strategy becomes harder and harder to pull off. According to a <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11031-018-9697-z">new paper</a> in <em>Motivation and Emotion</em>, an alternative approach that holds promise is to practice “cognitive reappraisal” – don’t ignore the sensations as such, but try to view them in a dispassionate way, as if you are a scientist studying running or a journalist reporting on the experience.</p>
<p><span id="more-34107"></span></p>
<p>The researchers, including Grace Giles and other members of the Cognitive Science Team at the US Army Natick Soldier Research, Development and Engineering Center in Massachusetts, recruited 24 healthy runners (aged 18 to 33, and including 15 women) whose lifestyle included completing at least one run of over nine miles per week.</p>
<p>The runners visited the research lab on three occasions, each time completing a 90-minute treadmill run, keeping their heart rate in the range of 75 to 85 per cent of their maximum – a level classified as “vigorous exercise”.</p>
<p>The first visit, the runners were given no specific instructions to follow in terms of how to cope with the challenge. On the second and third visits they were told to either use “cognitive reappraisal” (to adopt a neutral, detached attitude toward the subjective experience, like a scientist or journalist studying it) or “distraction” (thinking about things besides the run). They also received reminders through the run to use whichever strategy was allocated for that session.</p>
<p>Based on psychological measures they completed before each run, every 30-minutes during, and again afterwards, the participants felt they were exerting themselves less when they followed the “cognitive reappraisal” strategy and they experienced lower levels of emotional arousal, as compared with the run in which they were given no coping instructions. This was despite maintaining the same pace and heart-rate. In contrast, the distraction instructions appeared to make no difference to feelings of exertion or emotional arousal compared with the control run.</p>
<p>Giles and her team said their results are “relatively novel” and support previous findings that suggested distraction is an unreliable technique. “Instead cognitive reappraisal may benefit exercise experience relative to not using a cognitive strategy,” they concluded.</p>
<p>The findings come with some hefty caveats. Based on the researchers’ own manipulation check that involved asking participants to say which of several statements best described their thought processes during the runs, the participants did not actually engage in cognitive reappraisal during the cognitive reappraisal run. That said, the researchers reconsidered the statements they’d previously identified as reflecting cognitive reappraisal and decided they weren’t really appropriate – at least not to in relation to how they’d framed cognitive reappraisal in their instructions. On further reflection, they felt the runners’ choice of descriptive statements did suggest they had practiced the strategy adequately after all. They may be right, but these post-hoc gymnastics make the study findings feel less convincing.</p>
<p>Another issue to bear in mind is that these were fit, experienced runners – their average rating for their exertion during the runs was “somewhat hard” and they generally found the experience enjoyable. The findings might not generalise to less fit runners or more arduous challenges.</p>
<p>On a positive note, however, especially if you are new to running or finding it tough, the researchers reckon that both the emotion regulation strategies they tested might have a greater benefit for runners who usually find the experience less enjoyable.</p>
<p>Oh, and if you find nothing works to take the suffering away, at least take comfort from earlier research that suggested <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2015/04/16/marathon-runners-forget-how-painful-it-was/">your brain will trick you into remembering that the pain wasn’t really so bad.</a></p>

<p>Isaac Newton, Albert Einstein, Charles Darwin—what unites these three exceptional individuals? It is widely accepted that all three were geniuses, but there is something else. These days, neuroscientists believe that all three suffered from a specific neurological disorder called Asperger’s syndrome.</p>
<p>The whole definition of the term “<a href="http://brainblogger.com/2016/10/25/scholarship-for-college-students-living-with-a-neurological-disorder/">neurological disorder</a>” implies that something is going wrong in the brain. However, there is a growing recognition of the fact that when it comes to the processes in our brain, “going wrong” does not necessarily mean “going bad”. Our brain is too complicated a mechanism to be interpreted in simplistic terms. Some neurological disorders produce a peculiar state of mind often associated with high artistic and scientific achievements.</p>
<p>Asperger’s Syndrome (AS) is a developmental and neurological disorder that is often associated with symptoms of social withdrawal, motor clumsiness, and impaired communication skills. <em>The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental disorders (DSM-5)</em> classified AS in the same category as <a href="http://brainblogger.com/2016/07/16/new-link-between-autism-and-the-gut-microbiota/">Autism Spectrum Disorder</a> (ASD). It is often referred to as ‘High-functioning’ Autism (HFA), as individuals with AS are more intellectually capable and show less severe abnormalities compared to ASD subjects.</p>
<p>The story of AS and autism started in the 1940s, when two Viennese Scientists, Leo Kanner and Hans Asperger, described a syndrome observed in some children, with the unique characteristics of social isolation, impaired communication skills, and restrictive and <a href="http://brainblogger.com/2015/02/10/when-hoarding-becomes-dangerous/">obsessive interests</a>. Both scientists used the term ‘autistic’ in their reports.  While Kanner’s syndrome was published right away in 1943, Asperger’s report was written in German and remained undiscovered until 1991 when it reappeared in Uta Frith’s textbook <em>Autism and AS</em>.</p>
<p>Research and publications on Asperger’s syndrome reached its peak during 2000-2012. Different research groups proposed a set of criteria for AS diagnosis. While several of these criteria were overlapping, WHO’s International Classification of Diseases and Disorders set the following key characteristics that can be diagnostic for Asperger’s Syndrome:</p>
<ul>
<li>Qualitative social impairment involving dysfunctional social adaptivity, impaired non-verbal communication for interaction and lack of social reciprocity.</li>
<li>Restrictive pattern of interest, motor clumsiness, repetitive behavior, and extreme obsessiveness to specific rituals.</li>
<li>AS patients must show age-specific, normal cognitive and linguistic development.</li>
</ul>
<p>Interestingly, the father of Asperger Syndrome, Hans Asperger, described AS patients to be characteristically distinct from ASD subjects. He characterized them as intellectually-able, abstract-loving, and even overachieving in some specific cognitive domains.</p>
<p>Decades after Asperger’s observation, recent studies have also found that AS patients often demonstrate high verbal IQ, strong grammatical skills and they often outperform others in fluid reasoning although they are reported to show a delayed reaction time with poor performance IQ, specifically in symbol coding and processing speed.</p>
<p>Surprisingly, AS is more common than <a href="http://brainblogger.com/2015/02/02/causes-of-autism-remain-mysterious/">classical autism</a>. Epidemiological surveys report that about 4 out of every 10,000 children are autistic whereas about 25 out of 10,000 children are diagnosed with AS. AS is more common in boys than girls. No scientific explanation behind this observation exists at present.</p>
<p>Like with many other syndromes, no single specific cause is responsible for AS. Rather, a milieu of factors is associated with its development.</p>
<p>Children diagnosed with AS show a genetic pattern, like in autism, where at least one of the parents (most often the father) is diagnosed with AS or at least have some hallmark AS characteristics. The relatives of AS children are known to have <a href="http://brainblogger.com/2018/01/10/tryptophan-in-mood-anxiety-and-depression/">anxiety or depression related disorders</a>.</p>
<p>An important causal factor behind the development of AS might be the altered level of neurotransmitters. In AS patients, higher levels of N-Acetyl Aspartate/Choline (precursor of acetylcholine) intake and increased dopamine levels were reported, suggesting an overall altered dopaminergic neurotransmitter composition in major areas of the brain. Intranasal injection of <a href="http://brainblogger.com/2015/06/04/the-multiple-faces-of-love-hormone-oxytocin/">oxytocin</a>, a neuropeptide, was shown to improve facial emotion recognition abilities in AS patients.</p>
<p>Apart from alterations in neurotransmitter levels, neuroimaging studies show that there are structural changes in major areas of the brain that could be associated with the development of Asperger’s Syndrome. Altered grey and white matter volumes were observed in major brain regions, and an abnormal thickness of the hippocampus, amygdala, and anterior cingulate cortex was reported to be the major contributing factor for dysregulated cognitive functions in AS.</p>
<p>Some researchers also proposed that environmental factors can contribute indirectly to the development of AS. Viral or bacterial infection and smoking during pregnancy particularly increases the risk factor, although no concrete evidence supporting these views was found.</p>
<p>Due to the substantial number of overlapping similarities between Asperger’s Syndrome and Autism, it is very easy to confuse one with the other.</p>
<p>Studies in recent decades showed differences between AS and ASD on both quantitative and qualitative levels. The AS subjects displayed age-specific or earlier verbal development, meticulous speech ability, higher desire for social reciprocation, and supreme imagination compared to ASD patients.</p>
<p>On a cognitive level, AS subjects are more perceptive, they possess superior verbal performance and visual-spatial ability compared to ASD patients.</p>
<p>But the major limitations of these studies is the huge variability within the study groups and contradictions in the data patterns, as with age, the distinction between AS and ASD significantly reduces. It is particularly difficult to categorize AS from other disorders as there are no known biomarkers specific to AS only.</p>
<p>As there is not sufficient evidence of distinguishable characteristics for AS that can class the syndrome as ‘one biologically and clinically diagnosed entity’, the DSM-V in 2013 revised and categorized Asperger’s Syndrome as another variant of ASD. Although this decision was criticized by the scientific community, most of the researchers agreed that there is a need to conduct more studies that could help in distinguishing AS from other ASDs.</p>
<p>The most general misconception about Asperger’s syndrome or, as a matter of fact, about autism spectrum disorders in general, is that they develop because of <a href="http://brainblogger.com/2016/05/13/how-attachment-and-parenting-style-affect-adult-relationships/">poor parenting and a lack of bonding</a> between parents and their child. This concept was even termed as ‘Refrigerator Mother’ to describe cold and distant parenting. But this notion was challenged from the 1960’s when research on these neurological disorders started to grow and scientists found that it is not parenting, but rather the genetic and neurological makeup of the child that is responsible for these syndromes.  Even today, the belief that neurodevelopmental disorders are caused by a traumatic childhood are common. The reality, however, is more complicated than our guesses based on limited information.</p>

<p>Is sexting a good thing, because it’s sexually liberating, or a bad thing, because it’s objectifying? Separate research groups have put forward both arguments. But according to a <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/00224499.2018.1438576">new study</a> of college students in Hong Kong, it’s both.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>It’s estimated that roughly half of US college students (on which most research in this area has been done) send nude or sexually provocative images by phone or the internet. In the new study, reported in the <i>Journal of Sex Research</i>, the proportion was lower (13.6 per cent), perhaps because Chinese culture has a lower level of sexual permissiveness, but sexting was still relatively common, with almost one in five men and one in ten women saying they do it.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><span id="more-34103"></span></p>
<p>As the authors Mario Liong at Ritsumeikan University in Japan and Grand H.L. Cheng at the Duke-National University of Singapore, point out, some researchers have argued that sexting promotes objectification – the presentation of the body as an object to be judged, generally by prevailing cultural standards. But others have argued that it empowers people sexually, as they can be in more control of their own sexuality than they might be during a physical encounter.</p>
<p>To investigate who might be right, Liong and Cheng recruited 361 students, aged between 17 and 24, who filled in questionnaires that asked first whether they had ever sexted, and then assessed their views on so-called “body surveillance” (how often during the day they think about how they look, for example); feelings of body shame (they had to report the extent to which they agreed or disagreed with statements like “I feel ashamed of myself when I haven’t made the effort to look my best”); body control beliefs (“I can weigh what I’m supposed to when I try hard enough”, for instance); and, finally, comfort with nudity (for example, participants rated their comfort with situations such as “Being totally nude while sitting with a nude significant other”).</p>
<p>The results showed that among both men and women sexters had higher levels of body surveillance, which seemed to mediate their higher levels of body shame. But they were also more comfortable with nudity than non-sexters. There was no relationship between sexting and body control beliefs.</p>
<p>Increased body shame clearly isn’t desirable. But a greater comfort with nudity likely is, and this finding relates to experiences reported by erotic performers on live video cameras, the researchers argue: “When sexters pose erotically to take sexual pictures, they develop a liberated sexual subjectivity and become more comfortable with their bodies.”</p>
<p>The researchers point out that sexting is generally seen by authority figures – educators, parents and policymakers – as being unequivocally bad, whereas they believe their new results show it’s important to “break with [this] idea that sexting is simply harmful”.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>The researchers did only capture a snapshot in time, however, so it’s possible that the influences go the other way: people who are more comfortable with being nude are more likely to sext, and to experience self-objectification in the process. Longitudinal studies will be needed to investigate further. Also, this study did not look at whether the frequency of sexting had any impact, or whether there might be different effects for homosexual vs. heterosexual men and women. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>As the researchers readily point out, “More research is needed to understand the ways in which digital media have transformed sexuality and how individuals make use of this new tool to assert their sexual agency, despite being simultaneously constrained by it.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

<img alt="" class="attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image" height="110" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2018/06/Astyanax_fasciatus_Mexican_blind_cavefish_1_15719439215-e1530093880320-140x110.jpg" style="display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;" width="140" /><p>Mexican Tetra come in two distinct forms: the river dwelling surface fish and the far stranger cavefish, which have no eyes, and are found in isolated caves in North America.</p>
<p>Surface fish are typical river fish, they school; sleep at night, pay well-balanced attention to food, predators and mates; and calmly hover while resting. In contrast, cavefish swim continuously; rarely interact with mates or sleep; exhibit repetitive behavior patterns like circling around at the middle of a water column; and they have higher levels of cortisol, the anxiety hormone, in their blood.</p>
<figure class="wp-caption alignright" id="attachment_10318" style="width: 308px;"><img alt="" class="size-medium wp-image-10318" height="300" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2018/06/cavefish-298x300.jpg" width="298" /><div class="attachment-image--caption">The two forms of Mexican Tetra: surface fish and cavefish.</div><div class="attachment-image--source"></div></figure>
<p>These symptoms have similarities with those exhibited by people diagnosed with ASD, <a href="https://www.autismspeaks.org/what-autism/symptoms">characterized by</a> having difficulty in socially interacting with others, hyperactivity, sleeplessness, imbalanced attention, and anxiety.</p>
<p>We do not believe that these shared behaviors between human and fish are at the same level of complexity but they seem to be driven by evolutionarily conserved neural wirings. For example, emotion-based behavior, attention, socialness, and sleep regulation are based on conserved neural networks in the brain, such as the cortical region, thalamus, hypothalamus and habenula.</p>
<p>Findings from our recent study suggest that behaviors that we have observed in cavefish are evolutionarily conserved between fish and human.</p>
<h3><strong>ASD-risk genes in cavefish</strong></h3>
<p>We made comprehensive surveys for cavefish orthologs (genes that share the same evolutionary ancestor) of human ASD-risk genes. By referring to these genes, we found some surprising similarities between cavefish and human.</p>
<p>Most of the orthologs of ASD-risk genes in cavefish and ASD patients shared the same polarities of gene expressions (up or down-regulation of gene expression). This level of similarity is very high compared with other ASD rodent models and neurons from induced pluripotent stem cells derived from ASD patients.</p>
<figure class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_10319" style="width: 650px;"><img alt="" class="size-large wp-image-10319" height="223" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2018/06/lab-setup-1024x356.jpg" width="640" /><div class="attachment-image--caption">Lab setup</div><div class="attachment-image--source">Mexican Tetra: surface fish </div></figure>
<p>We also surveyed evolved genes in the cavefish lineage and found that ASD-risk genes evolved at twice the rate of other genes across the cavefish genome. Interestingly, ASD-risk genes are also positively selected in humans.</p>
<p>We are currently testing human ASD treatment drugs for fish social behaviors. We suggest that fish and human evolution share basic neural networks that generate ASD-like behaviors.</p>
<p>We and other groups believe that many cavefish behaviors are beneficial to finding food in the dark. But how did ASD-risk genes evolve in humans?</p>
<p>Human geneticist <a href="http://journals.plos.org/plosgenetics/article?id=10.1371/journal.pgen.1006618">Polimanti et al.</a> and others state that ASD is positively correlated with childhood intelligence, college completion, and years of schooling. <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/ng.3863">Weiner et al.</a> suggest many of ASD-risk genes are thought to provide cumulative effects that can lead to ASD. In other words, if you have a few ASD-risk mutations, you may have a better academic success; however, if you have mutations in many ASD-risk genes you have higher risk to express ASD.</p>
<h3><strong>ASD like behaviors in other species</strong></h3>
<p>Aside from cavefish, we do not know of any animal models that naturally show a series of autism-related behaviors. However, a recent study by <a href="http://www.pnas.org/content/114/36/9653">Shpigler et al.</a> suggested that ASD-risk genes are an evolutionary conserved gene set that regulates socialness in both honeybees and humans.</p>
<blockquote><p>It is possible that animals may shift their variety of behaviors by modifying ASD-risk genes to adapt to novel environments.</p></blockquote>
<p>We still have limited knowledge of the evolution of socialness and other behaviors in the context of adaptation because many of these behaviors are complex and are regulated by multiple genes. Based on the comparative studies between human, cavefish, and bee, it is possible that animals may shift their variety of behaviors by modifying ASD-risk genes to adapt to novel environments.</p>
<p>It will be interesting to test whether a set of ASD-risk genes are repeatedly targeted in other rapidly evolving species such as cichlid fishes in the lakes of East Africa, Trinidad guppies, and green anole lizards.</p>
<p>In the context of ASD-like behaviors, deer mice are known to show repetitive behavior under the novel environment. In addition, there are a number of domestic mutant mice including BTBR mice, and gene knock out-mice, which have lost the functions of ASD-risk genes. Many of them are characterized with their impairments in social interaction, lack of interest in cohorts, altered vocalization pattern, and stereotypic repetitive behaviors.</p>
<p>All of these are suggested as ASD-like behaviors by sharing the molecular and neural mechanisms to express ASD-like behaviors. However, these models do not overlap with systemic defects seen in ASD such as immune deficiency or impairment of digestive system. As we start characterizing that cavefish shows similar changes in both systems in addition to a set of ASD-like behaviors, we believe that cavefish can also fill a gap of systemic understanding of ASD, and can provide a foundation for new ASD therapy.</p>

<strong>Can psychology help us to be funnier?</strong> Our presenter <a href="https://www.ginnysmithscience.com">Ginny Smith</a> hears how a key ingredient of humour is “incongruity” and the surprise of unexpected meanings. Individual words too can be amusing, but actually most of the time we laugh not because we’ve seen or heard a joke, but as a natural part of friendly interaction.</p>
<p>Our guests, in order of appearance, are: Cardiff University neuroscientist <a href="http://www.deanburnett.com">Dean Burnett</a>, author of <em>The Happy Brain</em>; psychologist <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Tomas_Engelthaler">Tomas Engelthaler</a> at the University of Warwick, who co-authored a paper on the funniest words in English; and “stand up scientist” <a href="https://speechcommunicationlab.weebly.com">Sophie Scott</a> at UCL, who gave the 2017 Christmas lectures on the neuroscience of voices, speech and laughter.</p>

<img alt="" class="attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image" height="110" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2018/06/cancer-389921_1920-140x110.jpg" style="display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;" width="140" /><p>The gallbladder is a pear shaped organ located within the abdomen of the human body. The primary function of the gallbladder is to store and concentrate the bile fluid produced by the human liver. Bile fluid plays an integral role in the digestion and absorption of fats from the human gut. However, due to its function as a bile concentrating organ, the gallbladder is also prone to develop gallstones. Gallstone disease is one of the commonest reasons why humans undergo a surgical intervention.</p>
<blockquote><p>Cancer of the gallbladder is relatively rare in the western hemisphere.</p></blockquote>
<p>Cancer of the gallbladder is relatively rare in the western hemisphere; however it is still the fifth commonest malignancy of the gastrointestinal tract. Annually, there are roughly 4000-5000 new cases of gallbladder cancer diagnosed in the United States. A vast majority of the gallbladder cancer cases are diagnosed in the advanced stages of disease (stage III and above) resulting in poor clinical outcomes.</p>
<p>The mean survival after a gallbladder cancer diagnosis is a mere six months. The five year survival (a metric to assess cancer outcomes) is less than 3-8% for stage III gallbladder cancer and above. It is one of the deadliest cancers we know of.</p>
<p>Gallbladder cancer incidence has a unique global distribution as well. Most of the cancers known to mankind tend to be relatively uniformly distributed across countries and continents. In contrast, gallbladder cancer incidence is increased in geographically distinct locations of the world. These include places such as Chile, Northern parts of India and the state of New Mexico in the United States. What are the common drivers unique to these locations leading to increased gallbladder cancer incidence? We do not know for sure at the present time.</p>

<blockquote><p><span style="font-size: 16px;">Native Americans in New Mexico have a five-fold elevated incidence of gallbladder cancer compared to the Caucasians within the state.</span></p></blockquote>
<p><span style="font-size: 16px;">In addition to the unique geographical distribution, people of specific ethnicities appear to be more prone to gallbladder cancer as well. This includes the Native American populations of the North American continent. Native Americans in New Mexico have a five-fold elevated incidence of gallbladder cancer compared to the Caucasians within the state. While there are a multitude of risk factors that have been implicated in the causation of gallbladder cancer, there are no definitive associations. In our current review, we discuss these issues along with some likely factors implicated in the process of development of gallbladder cancers.</span></p>
<p>Another interesting feature is the elevated incidence of gallbladder cancer in women compared to men. Gallbladder cancer is one of the few cancers which has an elevated female incidence relative to men. Women are prone to develop gallstones in general. However, this does not explain the complete risk associated with increased gallbladder cancer development seen among women. Higher levels of estrogen may be one of the risk factors needed to drive gallbladder cancers and we need more research to understand its role in the development of this cancer.</p>
<figure class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_10301" style="width: 1956px;"><img alt="" class="wp-image-10301 size-full" height="909" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2018/06/12885_2018_4575_Fig1_HTML.png" width="1946" /><div class="attachment-image--caption">Gallbladder incidence in women compared to men of New Mexico from 2000 to 2014.</div><div class="attachment-image--source">Figure 1, Nemunaitis et al</div></figure>
<p>A significant drawback in our understanding of gallbladder cancer is the lack of readily available cell line and animal models. Additionally, funding for gallbladder cancer research is very limited, impeding our understanding of this disease. In order to make a dent in this disease, global collaborative efforts are critically needed through pooled resources and improving the collective knowledge of this disease across institutions. Instances of such collaborative efforts include the Chile Gallbladder Cancer Pilot Study and the Shanghai Biliary Tract Cancer Study led by Dr Jill Koshiol at the NIH.</p>
<p>Finally, clinical therapeutic options in gallbladder cancers are quite limited for patients with this disease. With the new emerging focus on personalized medicine/oncology, research into targetable markers in gallbladder cancer patients is urgently required. Interestingly, gallbladder and biliary tract cancers appear to have an interesting array of potential molecular targets which may be amenable to targeted therapeutics. Clinical trials and basic research efforts are urgently needed to establish the validity of these approaches to move the translational research findings back to gallbladder cancer patients.</p>
<blockquote><p>Clinical therapeutic options in gallbladder cancers are quite limited for patients with this disease.</p></blockquote>
<p>Another issue which we highlight in our review is the issue related to rural oncology healthcare access. New Mexico is a predominantly rural state. Native Americans in the state live on reservations which are far-flung, lacking immediate access to oncology care. This means that the gallbladder cancer patients are often reluctant to travel far distances to obtain the necessary and appropriate care. One of the authors  (UBG) is currently setting up a pilot clinical trial to enable tele-oncology based initiatives to address these issues.</p>
<p>In conclusion, our review paper highlights the major outstanding issues associated with gallbladder cancer. Due to the regional importance of this cancer within the state of New Mexico where both of us currently practice, we have sought to highlight the challenges surrounding gallbladder cancer in this review. There are currently far more questions than available answers surrounding this cancer. We are currently moving ahead with multiple initiatives (basic and clinical research) at our own institution (University of New Mexico Comprehensive Cancer Center) to make a dent in this rare, but deadly form of cancer.</p>

<p>Rene te Boekhorst's journal club session where he discusses the complexity of biological systems and presents the paper "<a class="reference external" href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022519305803431?via%3Dihub">A model of ion channel kinetics using deterministic chaotic rather than stochastic processes (Liebovitch and Toth, 1991)</a>".</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>In this talk, Rene will highlight some issues concerning the modelling of biological processes. The conventional approach to capture the complexity of biological systems is to focus on their unpredictability and to explain this in terms probability theory, i.e. as stochastic processes. Time series analysis and Markov Chains are popular tools for stochastic modelling and Rene will cover a few fundamental methodological aspects and assumptions of both formalisms. Rene will pay special attention to some terminological confusion concerning the probability distributions underlying Markov models.</p>
<p>If time permits, Rene will compare the results of a stochastic approach with a deterministic view of complexity, illustrated with a rather “heretic” application of chaos theory to model ion-channel kinetics by Liebovitch and Toth (1991).</p>

<img alt="" class="attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image" height="110" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2018/06/smoke-140x110.jpg" style="display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;" width="140" /><p>With the introduction of public smoking bans in enclosed spaces, it has been argued that this may lead to more smoking in the home and therefore to increased secondhand smoke (SHS) exposure of non-smoking family members and children. This ‘displacement hypothesis’ puts forward that a consequence of smoke-free legislation would be an increase in SHS-related diseases.</p>
<p>The alternative, the ‘social diffusion hypothesis’, supports that changes in social norms due to public smoking bans may result in an increase in voluntary home smoking bans.</p>
<p>Children are particularly vulnerable to SHS as they are unable to protect themselves from exposure; an estimated 40–50% of children with smoking parents and/or other smoking household members are regularly exposed to SHS and therefore, the displacement hypothesis would have an especially deleterious effect on this population.</p>
<p>In the first <a href="https://bmcpublichealth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12889-018-5679-z">systematic review</a> to focus on children’s SHS exposure at home before and after the introduction of smoke-free legislations, based on conducting a meta-analysis of pooled relative risks, Sarah Nanning and colleagues at the University of Bremen, Germany, have looked at 15 studies which were published between 2007 and 2016. With the sample sizes ranging from 118 to 68,000 participants in the studies assessed, these all presented proportions of children (most aged between 5 and 15 years) exposed to SHS at home before and after the introduction of smoke-free legislation.</p>
<p>The findings of the study indicate that children’s SHS exposure at home did not increase after the introduction of public smoking bans. The comprehensive laws (those that require worksites, restaurants, and bars to be smoke-free) and mixed smoke-free laws (where there are regional differences in the type or extent of public smoking bans within a country or with an exceptional rule for certain types of hospitality venues such as small bars) yielded reductions of SHS exposure at home, whereby the effect was much greater in the group with mixed smoke-free laws. The authors therefore discredit the ‘social diffusion hypothesis’.</p>

Since only 15 articles were included in this analysis, additional studies are required to assess the impact of public smoking bans on children’s SHS exposure at home. Furthermore, as most of the studies had a short follow-up period, long-term studies on this topic using a greater variation of included countries are also required.</p>

<p><em>By</em> <a href="http://www.psychologywriter.org.uk/">Christian Jarrett</a></p>
<p>Most of us are healthily deluded by memory biases that inflate our self-esteem. We remember more positive personal events than negative, for instance, and we selectively recall or even edit memories in a way that bolsters our favoured view of ourselves. A pair of psychologists at Lomonosov Moscow University propose that for people with persistent anxiety, this process goes awry. The worrier’s negative self-concept is instead reinforced by the selective recall of previous painful and awkward memories, harming their confidence and fuelling anxiety.</p>
<p>Imagine if it were possible to implant more positive autobiographical memories in these anxious individuals. This could boost their self-esteem, increase their confidence, thus dialling down their anxiety levels. In an intriguing <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/09658211.2017.1420195">new study</a> published in <em>Memory</em>, Veronika Nourkova and Darya Vaslienko have provided preliminary evidence that such an approach could work, although they found that hypnosis was required to make the memory implantation convincing enough.</p>
<p><span id="more-34087"></span></p>
<p>One hundred and twenty adult volunteers completed a measure of their trait anxiety. Next, they recalled three episodes from their past that demonstrated aspects of themselves that fuel their anxiety (for instance, one man recalled a time he lost his temper after failing to land a job role; a woman recalled a childhood memory of being unable to recite a poem in front of her father and teachers).</p>
<p>One group of the volunteers then attended more sessions during which they discussed with an interviewer how to modify these autobiographical memories to create false, edited versions in which they behaved in a more impressive way consistent with the kind of person they’d like to be. This was repeated weekly with a different memory targeted each session. Another group did the same but under hypnosis (of the Ericksonian conversational style). Yet another group went under hypnosis but listened to sounds of nature rather than editing their memories. A final control group didn’t edit their memories or go under hypnosis and simply spent the same time listening to sounds of nature.</p>
<p>A few days after these sessions ended, and again four months later, all the volunteers completed the trait anxiety measure again. They also described any changes in themselves that they experienced since taking part in the study.</p>
<p>The control group, and the group that created edited versions of their memories without hypnosis, both showed no changes in anxiety. The group that underwent hypnosis but performed no memory editing showed immediate reductions in anxiety but this didn’t last (if anything there was an unwelcome rebound to even higher anxiety). However, the group of volunteers who, under hypnosis, edited their memories to be more positive, enjoyed a significant reduction in anxiety at the four-month follow up. In their open-ended answers, they also described more experiences that suggested they had benefited from an increase in their self-esteem.</p>
<p>For the relevant memory-editing groups, the researchers tested how well the volunteers could distinguish between their real memories and the new, more positive versions. The group who created edited memories only through discussion could tell the difference quite easily, which suggests their falsely positive memories were not very plausible. In contrast, the group who edited memories under hypnosis found it difficult to tell the two apart, suggesting that the implantation of positive memories had been more successful and convincing. This might explain the apparent benefits they enjoyed to their self-esteem, which possibly contributed to increased confidence, thus explaining their lower anxiety at the later follow-up.</p>
<p>The researchers said they had “demonstrated that the intensification of positive construction [of false self-defining memories] may decrease trait anxiety in the long term by affecting the autobiographical knowledge base and thereby the working self.”</p>
<p>The results suggest it may be possible to exploit the known malleability of memory to edit people’s very sense of self, to make it more positive and closer to the kind of person they would like to be.</p>
<p>However, the findings should be considered preliminary and the explanation for the effects is quite speculative. There was no direct measure of self-esteem, for instance, and while the participants’ initial average levels of anxiety were on the cusp of being considered clinically significant, this was not a clinical sample with diagnosed anxiety problems. The very idea of therapists deliberately implanting false memories in people, even if they are positive, also raises obvious ethical issues.</p>

                <h4><a href="http://brainblogger.com/2018/06/25/the-5-second-rule-task-initiation/">The 5 Second Rule: Task Initiation</a></h4>

<p>The title—<i>The 5 Second Rule: Transform Your Life, Work, and Confidence with Everyday Courage</i>—intrigued me.</p>
<p>According to the publisher<i>, </i>Mel Robbins’s self-help book is <i>“</i>based on a simple psychological tool that the author developed to motivate herself. Using a technique that involves counting down backwards from five to one, she gave herself the extra push she needed to complete dreaded tasks, become more productive.”</p>
<p>Could this technique help solve my task-initiation problem?</p>
<p>I am a brain injury survivor. I have clusters of thin-walled blood vessels in my brain. Two of them bled. To prevent additional bleeds, I underwent brain surgeries, which left me with a number of challenging symptoms, including difficulties initiating tasks. </p>
<p>Though similar to procrastination in its end result, brain injury-related issues with task initiation feel very different. I am fully aware when I procrastinate, and I often laugh at myself in the process. When I procrastinate, I make conscious choices. Instead of working on the annual report, I choose to do the laundry, edit an essay, or take my dog for a walk. And when I run out of excuses or get too close to the deadline, I get started.</p>
<p>Trouble initiating tasks is more akin to the difficulty of shifting to a new undertaking after completing a long and involved project, when it feels almost impossible to switch to the next activity. </p>
<p>I usually have no idea that I’m having trouble initiating a task. I know with absolute certainty that I will get to the task—just not right now. In my mind, starting isn’t an issue, because this internal conviction that “of course I’ll do it” is so strong. It’s as if there’s a disconnect between the belief that I’ll do the task and the cognitive action required to actually initiate it. I’m not choosing to distract myself, and I’m not trying to postpone the inevitable. There’s simply no conscious awareness and no control over it.</p>
<p>Compounding the challenge is that brain injury-related task initiation problems don’t follow any recognizable pattern. They arise without warning and are frequently unrelated to the nature of the task, interfering equally with tasks I enjoy and those I’d rather avoid. They can last anywhere from several days to several years. They often end abruptly, for no apparent reason. When my brain releases me, I’m off and running, all signs of struggle gone, as if the problem never existed.</p>
<p>To combat my difficulties beginning an activity, my neuropsychologist suggested I keep a daily list and block off chunks of time in my calendar to work on those tasks. Fortunately, my brain injury brought on a level of rigidity—once an item is on that list, I feel compelled to address it. </p>
<p>Alas, identifying problematic tasks to include on the list is not straightforward, because the same “I know I’ll get to it” belief means there’s no problem, and it doesn’t occur to me that it belongs on the list. And I sometimes can’t initiate writing the list—I know I’ll write it, just not right now.</p>
<p>I’d recently been having trouble beginning a new essay on a topic I wanted to explore. It had been simmering in my mind for a while, and I felt ready to begin writing. But I couldn’t. I tried tricking my brain into cooperating by breaking the task into smaller and hopefully more manageable chunks. </p>
<p>I was able to sit down in front of my computer, but my brain refused to attempt the next task. Later, I managed to open a new file, but my mind wouldn’t move beyond that chunk. I left the file open, knowing I’d get to it (just not now). A few days later, I typed a title, but couldn’t start the body of the essay. I knew exactly how I wanted it to begin. The words were there. But <i>I</i> wasn’t. </p>
<p>Galvanized into action by Robbins’ five second rule, I was determined to try it the next morning. </p>
<p>As I finished getting dressed, I thought about working on the essay. “5-4-3-2-1” and there I was, at my computer, tapping away, the essay taking form just as I’d imagined it.</p>
<p>Every time my inner voice suggested I needed to take a breather, before I had time to question my motive, I applied the five second rule. “5-4-3-2-1” and I was back on track. After finishing a first draft, I wondered about working on another troublesome essay. Five seconds later, I was back at the keyboard. Feeling like I was on a roll and afraid that I’d fall prey to my damaged brain if I paused, I moved on to sending email queries about speaking engagements and book events. </p>
<p>The next problematic item that came to mind gave me pause—I needed to grade a pile of essays. This time, the five second rule failed, because common sense kicked in. I had reached my limit—fatigue overwhelmed me and my brain blanked out. I absolutely had to rest, or I’d be in no shape to do anything.</p>
<p>I came away from that day feeling good about myself. I’d been more productive than I’d been in a long time. But I was also exhausted. Applying the five second rule had thoroughly drained me.</p>
<p>I have since realized that the five second rule doesn’t work for me exactly the way Mel Robbins explained it. I haven’t abandoned it, but as with so many other things post-injury, I am learning to adapt it to my particular circumstances. I have to pace myself, and as soon as I recognize the early signs of fatigue, I use the rule to take a nap. </p>
<p>My conclusion?</p>
<p>The five second rule rules.</p>

<p><i>By</i> <a href="https://emmayoung.net/">Emma Young</a></p>
<p>“I have been lost in a daydream for as long as I can remember….These daydreams tend to be stories…for which I feel real emotion, usually happiness or sadness, which have the ability to make me laugh and cry…They’re as important a part of my life as anything else; I can spend hours alone with my daydreams….I am careful to control my actions in public so it is not evident that my mind is constantly spinning these stories and I am constantly lost in them.”</p>
<p>The 20-year-old woman who emailed these reflections to Eli Somer at the University of Haifa, Israel, diagnosed herself with Maladaptive Daydreaming, sometimes known as Daydreaming Disorder. While Maladaptive Daydreaming is not included in standard mental health diagnostic manuals, there are cyber-communities dedicated to it, and “in recent years it has gradually become evident that daydreaming can evolve into an extreme and maladaptive behaviour, up to the point where it turns into a clinically significant condition,” write Somer and Nirit Soffer-Dudek at Ben-Gurion University of the Negev, in a <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5962718/">new paper</a> on the disorder, published in <i>Frontiers in Psychiatry</i>.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><span id="more-34091"></span></p>
<p>This study is, they say, the first to explore the mental health factors that accompany Maladaptive Daydreaming (MD) over time – and it provides insights into not only what might cause these intense, vivid, extended bouts of daydreaming but also hints at how to prevent them, or how to stop them in their tracks. Because while many people who experience MD report enjoying their daydreams at the time, MD can also negatively affect their relationships with others, their day-to-day lives, and their overall emotional wellbeing.</p>
<p>Earlier work led researchers to suggest that MD might be either a dissociative disorder, a disturbance of attention, a behavioural addiction or an obsessive-compulsive spectrum disorder.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>For the new online study, Somer and Soffer-Dudek recruited 77 self-diagnosed sufferers of MD, from 26 different countries, ranging in age from 18-60. Just over 80 per cent were women (possibly because women seem to be more affected by MD than men, the researchers write).</p>
<p>The participants first provided details about any mental health diagnoses (21 had been diagnosed with depression, 14 with anxiety disorders and 5 with OCD, among other disorders). Then, each evening before bed, for 14 days, they completed a series of questionnaires that asked about their experiences that day. These scales assessed levels of dissociation, obsessive-compulsive symptoms, depression, general anxiety, social anxiety, and emotion – and also maladaptive day dreaming. (Participants were asked to report on the extent to which statements such as “I felt the need or urge to continue a daydream that was interrupted by a real-world event at a later point” had applied to them that day.)<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>On average, participants reported spending four hours a day daydreaming. On days on which their MD was more intense and time-consuming, they also experienced higher levels of obsessive-compulsive symptoms, dissociation and negative emotion, and both types of anxiety. But only obsessive-compulsive symptoms consistently predicted the intensity and duration of maladaptive daydreaming on the next day, regardless of the levels of obsessive-compulsive symptoms on that following day.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Despite these findings, the researchers note that only five of the participants had actually been diagnosed with OCD –  “This discrepancy suggests that obsessive-compulsive symptoms and MD share common mechanisms and interact with each other…but MD does not seem to be merely a subtype of OCD.” However, they added that many people with MD describe being consistently drawn to their daydreaming in a compulsive way. “The finding that a surge in obsessive-compulsive symptoms precedes MD [also] points to a key role of this construct as a contributing mechanism,” Somer and Soffer-Dudek argue.</p>
<p>Compulsions to daydream, or to carry on daydreaming even after many hours have passed, might be addressed using cognitive behavioural approaches developed to address other compulsions, the researchers suggest. They also speculate that low levels of the neurotransmitter serotonin may play a role in MD, as in OCD. If future work confirms this, drugs that modify serotonin levels may possibly be used in treatment.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>There were some limitations of the study – in particular, that it was based entirely on self-reports. But as research on MD is scarce, and this is thought to be the first longitudinal exploration of the disorder, the results should at least help to inform future work in this area. Though it’s also possible that not all people with MD will want treatment. As the woman with MD who emailed Somer also wrote: “I am torn between the love of my daydreams and the desire to be normal.”</p>

En route <a href="https://noahstrycker.com/books/birding-without-borders/">to encountering a record-setting 6,042 bird species in 2015</a>, intrepid birdwatcher Noah Strycker spent three full months in South America (sometimes referred to as the Bird Continent), but only twelve days in Europe.</p>
<p>This is not to say that European birds are any less interesting than those found at more southerly latitudes; it simply reflects the strikingly uneven global distribution of the world’s 11,000 living bird species.</p>
<blockquote><p>Many major groups of birds are entirely restricted to South America, Africa, and Australasia</p></blockquote>
<p>Not only are species numbers higher in the Southern Hemisphere, but many major groups of birds are entirely restricted to South America, Africa, and Australasia – all vestiges of the ancient southern supercontinent of Gondwana.</p>
<p>But how did this uneven geographic distribution of living bird diversity arise? Does it simply reflect the fact that most groups of living birds arose on the southern continents, and failed to disperse elsewhere? Or have more complex patterns governed the evolutionary history of avian geographic distributions through geological time?</p>

<p>The only way to definitively answer this question is to flesh out the fossil record of modern birds. In our new study, just published in <em>BMC Evolutionary Biology</em>, we examined a beautifully preserved 52-million-year-old fossil bird named <em>Foro panarium</em>. Originally discovered in western North America in the 1980’s, and named in the 1990’s, <em>F. panarium </em>exhibits an enigmatic mix of anatomical features that has prevented a robust assessment of its affinities.</p>
<p>By re-examining its anatomical features in an updated evolutionary context, our work supports <em>Foro panarium</em> as the earliest known relative of a group of living birds called turacos, or “banana eaters”. Turacos are an outrageously beautiful group of ~24 species of medium-sized fruit-eating birds, and the feathers of <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/131708321@N02/sets/72157686118399406">several species contain unique pigments</a> that generate bright green and magenta tones. In addition to these interesting aesthetic attributes, modern turacos are also known for being entirely restricted to sub-Saharan Africa.</p>
<p>But if the fossil, <em>Foro panarium</em>, hails from North America, what does that tell us about the ancient geographic distribution of the group that gave rise to modern turacos? And how did modern turacos become restricted to Africa in the modern day?</p>
<p>It turns out that <em>Foro panarium</em> is far from the first example of a fossil bird being found outside the modern distribution of its closest living relatives. Many other groups of birds that today are restricted to southern landmasses, such as the <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/131708321@N02/sets/72157684444609383">seriemas</a> of South America , or the <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/131708321@N02/albums/72157687089869025">mousebirds</a> of Africa, have fossil representatives known from entirely different parts of the world.</p>

Field</div></figure>
<p>Our paper reaffirms the complexity such observations can introduce into analyses focused on discerning ancestral geographic distributions of modern birds (please see refs <a href="http://advances.sciencemag.org/content/1/11/e1501005">1</a>, <a href="http://advances.sciencemag.org/content/1/11/e1501005">2</a> and <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/jbi.12969">3</a>). While our analyses examining only modern birds confidently infer that the most recent common ancestor of all living birds arose in the Southern Hemisphere, our analyses which incorporate fossils return a decidedly less certain result.</p>
<p>These analyses tell us that either modern birds did not arise in the Southern Hemisphere, or, if they did, that subsequent fluctuations in the geographic distributions of modern birds have been vastly more complex than we could understand without the fossil record.</p>
<p>Future work will attempt to more clearly discern the <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12549-011-0062-4">major factors</a> driving the dramatic shifts in geographic range documented by the fossil record. Are these ancient episodes of inferred dispersal related to periods of climatic change throughout Earth history? Or were they perhaps related to periodic extinction events throughout geological time?</p>
<p>Beyond the implications for understanding the geographic history of the lineage including turacos, <em>Foro panarium</em> sheds additional light on the age of the turaco lineage itself. The age of the fossil makes <em>F. panarium </em>not only the oldest-known representative of the turaco lineage, but the <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nature15697">oldest representative</a> of the major group that includes turacos, cuckoos, and bustards (which are large, ground-dwelling birds).</p>
<p>Thus, turacos must have diverged from their closest living relatives by at least 52 million years ago, which may suggest that this group was part of a rapid avian radiation in the aftermath of the end-Cretaceous mass extinction event, 66 million years ago (that famously wiped out the giant dinosaurs).</p>
<blockquote><p>Many living birds that are strictly tree-dwelling have relatively short hindlimbs, a <a href="http://rstb.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/287/1019/131">specialization</a> that lowers their centre of mass for enhanced perching stability.</p></blockquote>
<p><em>Foro panarium</em> also provides interesting insights into the evolution of modern turaco biology. Many living birds that are strictly tree-dwelling have relatively short hindlimbs, a <a href="http://rstb.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/287/1019/131">specialization</a> that lowers their centre of mass for enhanced perching stability.</p>
<p>This is the case for living turacos, which are both tree-dwelling and exhibit relatively short hindlimbs. However, the hindlimbs of <em>F. panarium</em> are quite long, similar to living ground-dwelling birds. This observation may point to the relatively late acquisition of arboreality among the ancestors of turacos—consistent with the idea that a tree-dwelling lifestyle arose independently <a href="http://theconversation.com/how-birds-survived-the-dinosaur-killing-asteroid-97021">numerous times among living birds</a> following the forest-destroying end-Cretaceous extinction event.</p>
<p>The multifaceted insights yielded by <em>Foro panarium</em> illustrate the profound importance of the fossil record for accurately understanding the evolutionary history of modern birds. Clearly, a better understanding of the evolutionary affinities of modern bird fossils has the potential to radically improve our understanding of how and when modern birds, and their characteristic geographic distributions, evolved. Our picture of bird evolutionary history will continue to grow sharper as each new bird fossil gets unearthed … not unlike adjusting the focus on a distant turaco through binoculars.</p>

Do scientists have a responsibility to make their work accessible to the public?



"Public Engagement", broadly speaking, means scientists communicating about science to non-scientists. Blogs are a form of public engagement, as are (non-academic) books. Holding public talks or giving interviews would also count as such.



Recently, it has become fashionable to say that it is important for scientists to engage the public, and that this engagement should be encouraged. I agree completely

                <h4><a href="http://yourbrainhealth.com.au/seven-common-sense-building-blocks-for-your-childs-brain/">Seven common-sense building blocks for your child’s brain.</a></h4>

<p><img alt="" class="size-large wp-image-5563 aligncenter" height="655" src="http://yourbrainhealth.com.au/wp/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/dandelion-761104_1920-1024x655.jpg" width="1024" /></p>
<p> </p>
<p>All children differ in their biological susceptibility to life experiences in a ‘for better and for worse’ manner. Some kids are particularly sensitive to both highly stressful <em>and</em> highly nurturing environments. Like orchids, such children bloom if lovingly cultivated, but wilt and wither if neglected.</p>
<p>In contrast, adaptable resilient children who don’t get easily stressed are like little dandelions, they’ll grow and thrive anywhere.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19883141" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Studies</a> are now showing ‘orchid’ and ‘dandelion’ genes linked to particular enzymes or brain chemical receptors, if and only if combined with early childhood toxic stress, can trigger behavioural problems and mood disorders later in life.</p>
<blockquote><p>“It’s possible we’ve underestimated the importance of childhood.” Professor Richie Poulton.</p></blockquote>
<p>Poulton is head of the <a href="https://dunedinstudy.otago.ac.nz/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Dunedin Study</a>, a research programme that has closely tracked every aspect of the lives of 1037 people born in Dunedin, New Zealand in 1972 and 1973.</p>
<p>The Dunedin study has shown that early life experiences shape developing brain architecture and strongly affect whether children grow up to be healthy, productive members of society. Toxic stress — defined as stress that is extreme or long-lasting or occurs outside an environment of supportive, attached caregiver relationships — derails healthy brain development, with damaging effects on learning, behaviour, and physical and mental health across the lifespan.</p>
<p>While writing The Women’s Brain Book I spent much of Chapter 2 exploring what can go wrong during childhood – from the effects of trauma to family stress to learning negative gender stereotypes. I worried that if readers had young children they were probably ready to drop the book and run off to bulk-buy cotton wool and bubble wrap.</p>
<p>Given what we know about normal and abnormal brain development, what experiences do infants and children (the dandelions and the orchids) need to thrive, not just survive? What can adults who raise children do to foster healthy, happy brains?</p>
<p>Faced with wading through decades of childhood development literature, I instead picked up the phone and called my friend and colleague <a href="https://drkristygoodwin.com/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Dr Kristy Goodwin</a>. Goodwin is a children’s learning and development researcher and she has <a href="https://drkristygoodwin.com/book/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">summarised</a> seven essential experiences or, as she calls them ‘building blocks’ for optimal brain development.</p>
<h2>What do growing brains need to thrive?</h2>
<h3>1. Attachments and relationships.</h3>
<p>Warm, predictable and loving relationships allow children to feel secure, safe and unstressed.</p>
<h3>2. Language.</h3>
<p>Infants and young children need ample opportunities to hear and use language: ‘serve-and-return’ interactions are crucial.</p>
<h3>3. Sleep.</h3>
<p>Sleep is vital for children’s emotional, physical and mental development.</p>
<h3>4. Play.</h3>
<p>Through play, babies and children develop cognitive skills, creativity and emotional regulation. They need ample opportunities to experiment and explore, including time outdoors in nature. Dr Goodwin highlights the modern-day need to counteract ‘screen time’ with ‘green time’.</p>
<h3>5. Physical Movement.</h3>
<p>Children need to master simple then complex motor skills in order to develop more sophisticated, higher-order thinking skills later on.</p>
<h3>6. Nutrition.</h3>
<p>Quality nutrition is vital for optimal development. Children’s diets need to be rich in foods that contain essential fatty acids optimal for brain development.</p>
<h3>7. Executive Function Skills.</h3>
<p>Children need to master simple higher-order thinking skills such as impulse control and working memory.</p>
<blockquote><p>“Given that we know experience accounts for about 70%  of a child’s development. It’s critical that we provide them with the right types of experiences.” Dr Kristy Goodwin.</p></blockquote>
<p>Poulton, Goodwin and I agree that childhood is a sacred time. It’s a unique period in the lifespan that needs to be treasured, nurtured and protected.</p>

In research on people, scientists are typically interested in the group data - the mean, median, and variance of a sample of people. But according to a provocative new paper out in PNAS, the statistics of a group can obscure the variability within individuals, over time.





The paper, from Aaron J. Fisher, John D. Medaglia, and Bertus F. Jeronimus, isn't really making a new point. The pitfalls of generalizing from the group to the individual level have long been known - but these issues

Sexual harassment is disturbingly prevalent in academia. But a course correction may involve tearing down the hierarchy that makes science run.

<img alt="Pride Parade" class="attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image" height="110" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2018/06/gay-pride-140x110.jpg" style="display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;" width="140" /><p>When I decided to write this blog, my hope was to write something uplifting since Pride month is a time of celebration.  I was determined to find recently published articles on the advancements in LGBTQ health. After looking through all pertinent journals from BMC’s 185 journals on medicine and public health, my results were disappointing. All of the articles I found on LGBTQ health painted a dismal picture.</p>
<p>The articles I found addressed either LGBTQ health disparities or the challenges in obtaining health care. Article after article discussed how LGBTQ individuals experience greater rates of mental health issues compared to their heterosexual counterparts.</p>
<p>It is crucial that we know what these health issues are, where they are found, and their etiological underpinnings. As I proceeded with my research, it became clear that the poor mental health amongst LGBTQ individuals could be attributed to stigma, three types in particular: enacted stigma, felt stigma, and internalized stigma.</p>
<blockquote><p>There is a 34.9% lifetime prevalence of suicidal ideation amongst MSM. This rate increases to 42.6% when looking at populations from high income countries.</p></blockquote>
<p>Enacted stigma includes overt behaviors of prejudice and victimization.  Felt stigma involves the psychological impact of rejection as well as concealing one’s sexual orientation. Internalized stigma, or internalized homophobia, involves LGBTQ individuals having negative feelings towards homosexuality and their own sexual orientation. One study conducted in Germany found that all three forms of stigma were <a href="https://bmcpsychiatry.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12888-017-1435-7">positively correlated with mental health issues.</a></p>
<p>Fortunately, there have been recent <a href="https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/7998/4c4c55269fb42882379aca0e7b0ec50a10c2.pdf">advances in LGBTQ rights and acceptance</a> within the Western world. However, these advances are absent in other parts of the world such as China.</p>
<p>Studies have shown that rates of internalized stigma are higher in men who have sex with men (MSM) in China than in other countries. It was also found that amongst Chinese MSM, higher rates of internalized homophobia are associated with <a href="https://equityhealthj.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12939-017-0530-1">higher rates of psychological distress.</a></p>
<p>Of all the subsequent effects from mental health issues that the LGBTQ group faces, suicide is the biggest concern. In Canada, <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/09581596.2014.946887?scroll=top&amp;needAccess=true">suicide</a> is the number one cause of premature mortality amongst MSM. <a href="https://bmcpsychiatry.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12888-017-1575-9">One meta-analysis</a> found that there is a 34.9% lifetime prevalence of suicidal ideation amongst MSM. This rate increases to 42.6% when looking at populations from high income countries.</p>
<blockquote><p>Not only did sexual minority women experience worse mental health compared to their exclusively heterosexual counterparts, but they also experienced greater rates of interpersonal violence.</p></blockquote>
<p>MSM are not the only LGBTQ population that experience poor mental health. This pattern also occurs in sexual minority women. These findings primarily come by comparing exclusively heterosexual women to sexual minority women. Unfortunately there are few studies examining subsets of sexual minority women, which include mainly heterosexuals, bisexuals, and lesbians.</p>
<p><a href="https://bmcwomenshealth.biomedcentral.com/track/pdf/10.1186/s12905-017-0452-5">In an Australian study</a> not only did sexual minority women experience worse mental health compared to their exclusively heterosexual counterparts, but they also experienced greater rates of interpersonal violence. Of further concern, bisexual women have the highest levels of stress, anxiety symptoms, and depression while simultaneously having the lowest levels of mental health and life satisfaction.</p>
<p>Sexual and gender minorities from certain populations are also found to experience greater rates of mental health conditions. Sex workers experience high rates of violence and sexual health vulnerabilities, however research on mental health in this population is lacking.</p>
<p><a href="https://bmcwomenshealth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12905-017-0491-y">A study of sex workers in Canada</a> found that 49% of sex workers are diagnosed with mental health conditions. When researchers delved further into the data they found that identifying as a sexual and/or gender minority was a significant predictor of obtaining a mental health diagnosis.</p>

<p>Pride is unique because it is a time to celebrate love and acceptance; a time when literally all the colors of the rainbow permeate the streets.</p>
<p>For many, this is a reprieve from the day-to-day challenges that many LGBTQ individuals experience. It is a way to provide support and encouragement to these people who are in such desperate need of support and acceptance.</p>
<p>We cannot ignore the dangers that this community faces throughout the world and how stigma can result in millions of people experiencing poor mental health, psychiatric illness, suicidal ideation, and even death by suicide, but by rallying during Pride, LGBTQ individuals have an opportunity to not only embrace their true selves but also fight to protect themselves and others from the challenges they inevitably face throughout the world.</p>

<img alt="" class="attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image" height="110" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2018/06/Formica.sanguinea6.-.lindsey-140x110.jpg" style="display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;" width="140" /><p>Nobody can deny the fascination arising from the complexity of the social architecture which defines the life of the anthill, and the slave-raiding behaviour of some species of <em>Formica </em>outstands as a spectacular case of social parasitism.</p>
<p>The evolutionary pathway towards slavery has been intriguing generations of natural scientists, and gave life to a discussion which finds its roots in Charles Darwin ‘<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/On_the_Origin_of_Species">On the Origin of Species</a>’ itself.</p>
<p>The father of the theory of evolution suggested that slave-raiding in the genus <em>Formica</em> evolved progressively, through an intermediary step of so-called ‘temporary parasitism’. This hypothesis is sustained by several modern researchers, but other scientists propose an alternative explanation, suggesting that parasitic colony founding evolved several times independently.</p>
<p>To unravel the nodes of a 150-years old debate, <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Jonathan_Romiguier">Jonathan Romiguier</a>, with a group of researchers from the University of Lausanne, Montpellier, British Columbia and Helsinki, took advantage of a modern phylogenomic approach to finally solve the intricate relationship among paleartic <em>Formica</em> subgenera.</p>
<p>Using a mixed experimental and bioinformatics methodology, Romiguier and his colleagues generated a phylogenetic tree to reconstruct the evolutionary steps of the four <em>Formica</em> subgenera differentiation. Following the clades of their phylogenetic tree, we can retrace the history of paleartic <em>Formica</em>, highlighting the key moments of the journey from freedom to slavery.</p>
<figure class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_10273" style="width: 788px;"><img alt="" class="size-full wp-image-10273" height="334" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2018/06/12862_2018_1159_Fig1_HTML.gif" width="778" /><div class="attachment-image--caption">Molecular phylogeny of <em>Formica</em></div><div class="attachment-image--source">Taken from manuscript</div></figure>
<p>At the basal position of the tree, we find the free living <em>Serviformica</em>, the only group which is able to form colonies independently, indicating that <em>Formica </em>genus shares a free living ancestor with independent colony founding.</p>
<p>Following the tree, and therefore the evolution of <em>Formica</em>, we can find a single clade grouping the remaining subgenera, <em>Coptoformica</em>, <em>Formica s. str.</em> and the slave-making <em>Raptiformica</em>.</p>
<p>They all share some fundamental traits, such as the loss of the ability of independently found new colonies and temporary parasitic colony founding, suggesting that they can be considered quite close relatives, sharing a common ancestor that started to parasitize the <em>Serviformica </em>nests, and which passed on this capability to all of the three groups.</p>
<p><em>Coptoformica</em> and <em>Formica s. str.</em>, also known as ‘wood ants’, however, rely on mechanisms other than slavery to start new colonies. They normally perform ‘budding’, a process where new queens and workers leave to start a new colony nearby. This behaviour leads to the creation of super colonies of many inter-connected nests, and it is thought to be an adaptation to cold habitats, where the success of independent colony founding is limited by high queen mortality. In this context, intra-specific brood transport among nests is often observed.</p>
<p>Wood ants can use so-called ‘temporary parasitism’; in this case, new queens enter the nest of a <em>Serviformica</em> species, expelling and replacing the original queen, and use the host workers as helpers. With time, host workers are gradually replaced by the daughters of the temporary parasite queen.</p>
<p>More recently, <em>Raptiformica</em> developed the unique feature of active slave-making, alongside temporary parasitism. This is perpetrated as seasonal, inter-specific brood robbing from <em>Serviformica</em> nests to increase worker force. After emerging, <em>Serviformica</em> workers behave as if they were in their own colony.</p>
<p>In this context, the brood exchange typical of wood ants could have evolved toward selfish brood robbing during territorial battles, to ultimately become the inter-specific slave-raiding observed in <em>Raptiformica</em>.</p>
<p>Resolving the deepest nodes of <em>Formica</em> relationships led to the formulation of a theory that confirms Darwin first hypothesis.</p>
<p>The branching order of phylogeny suggests the evolutionary pathway towards slavery had a single origin, which then developed in several steps, where temporary parasitism can be seen as an intermediary step between free-living hosts and slave-maker parasites.</p>
<p>At the end of our evolutionary journey, we can look at the phylogenetic tree of Romiguier as a solid backbone in support of the classic model described in ‘On the Origin of the Species’, which adds a dowel to the global puzzle of evolution of slave-making in ants.</p>
