              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/nasa-perseverance-rover-mars-rock-sample-space">NASA’s Perseverance rover snagged its first Martian rock samples</a></h4>

              
                <p>The Perseverance rover has captured its first two slices of Mars.</p>



<p>NASA’s latest Mars rover drilled into a flat rock nicknamed Rochette on September 1 and filled a roughly finger-sized tube with stone. The sample is the first ever destined to be sent back to Earth for further study. On September 7, the rover snagged a second sample from the same rock. Both are now stored in airtight tubes inside the rover’s body.</p>



<p>Getting pairs of samples from every rock it drills is “a little bit of an insurance policy,” says deputy project scientist Katie Stack Morgan of NASA’s Jet Propulsion Lab in Pasadena, Calif. It means the rover can drop identical stores of samples in two different places, boosting chances that a future mission will be able to pick up at least one set.</p>



<p>The successful drilling is a comeback story for Perseverance. The rover’s first attempt to take a bit of Mars ended with the <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/perseverance-rover-mars-photos-nasa">sample crumbling to dust</a>, leaving an empty tube (<em>SN: 8/19/21</em>). Scientists think that rock was too soft to hold up to the drill.</p>





<p>Nevertheless, the rover persevered.</p>



<p>“Even though some of its rocks are not, Mars is hard,” said Lori Glaze, director of NASA’s&nbsp; planetary science division, in a September 10 news briefing.</p>



<p>Rochette is a hard rock that appears to have been less severely eroded by millennia of <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/perseverance-mars-weather-dust-storms">Martian weather</a> (<em>SN: 7/14/20</em>). (Fun fact: All the rocks Perseverance drills into will get names related to national parks; the region on Mars the rover is now exploring is called Mercantour, so the name Rochette — or “Little Rock” &nbsp;— comes from a village in France near Mercantour National Park.)</p>



<p>Rover measurements of the rock’s texture and chemistry suggests that it’s made of basalt and may have been part of an ancient lava flow. That’s useful because volcanic rocks preserve their ages well, Stack Morgan says. When scientists on Earth get their hands on the sample, they’ll be able to use the concentrations of certain elements and isotopes to figure out exactly how old the rock is — something that’s never been done for a pristine Martian rock.</p>



<p>Rochette also contains salt minerals that probably formed when the rock interacted with water over long time periods. That could suggest groundwater moving through the Martian subsurface, maybe creating habitable environments within the rocks, Stack Morgan says.</p>



<p>“It really feels like this rich treasure trove of information for when we get this sample back,” Stack Morgan says.</p>



<p>Once a future mission brings the rocks back to Earth, scientists can search inside those salts for tiny fluid bubbles that might be trapped there. “That would give us a glimpse of Jezero crater at the time when it was wet and was able to sustain ancient Martian life,” said planetary scientist Yulia Goreva of JPL at the news briefing.</p>



<p>Scientists will have to be patient, though — the earliest any samples will make it back to Earth is 2031. But it’s still a historic milestone, says planetary scientist Meenakshi Wadhwa of Arizona State University in Tempe.</p>



<p>“These represent the beginning of Mars sample return,” said Wadhwa said at the news briefing. “I’ve dreamed of having samples back from Mars to analyze in my lab since I was a graduate student. We’ve talked about Mars sample return for decades. Now it’s starting to actually feel real.”</p>

<p><strong>Sea life’s chemical senses <br></strong><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/sea-lifes-chemical-senses"><em>Science News</em></a>, September 18, 1971</p>



<p>For fish and other underwater life, a sensitivity to chemicals plays the same role as the sense of smell does for land animals.… [Researchers] have been studying the subtle ways this delicate fish-communication system can be disrupted by pollutants…. One study examined the effects of kerosene pollution on the behavior of lobsters…. The experiments demonstrate that chemical communication interference takes place at extremely low dilutions.</p>



<h4>Update</h4>



<p>Chemical pollution — <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/aquatic-non-scents">from sewage and agricultural runoff to pharmaceutical waste</a> — muddles aquatic animals’ senses with potentially dire effects, decades of research has shown. A chemical used to treat sewage seems to limit some fish species’ abilities to <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/smells-funny-fish-schools-break-over-body-odor">form schools</a>, making the fish vulnerable to predators (<em>SN: 10/27/07, p. 262</em>). Drug-tainted waters can have a variety of effects on fish, including <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/antidepressants-make-sad-fish">suppressing their appetites</a> (<em>SN: 12/20/08, p. 15</em>). A plastic chemical also appears to confuse senses: Its scent can <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/sea-turtles-smell-plastic-ocean-food">lure sea turtles into eating plastic debris</a> (<em>SN: 3/28/20, p. 14</em>).</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/boa-snake-caribbean-hispaniolan-vineboa">A newfound boa sports big eyes and a square nose</a></h4>

              
                <p>A wide-eyed snake has made scientists do a double take. The Hispaniolan vineboa, with its large protruding eyes and square snout, is the first boa species to be discovered in the Dominican Republic in more than a century.</p>



<p>Naturalist Miguel Landestoy of the Universidad Autónoma de Santo Domingo in the Dominican Republic and colleagues discovered the snake, <em>Chilabothrus ampelophis, </em>slithering in a patch of mountainous dry forest near the country’s southwestern border with Haiti on the island of Hispaniola. The last time researchers described a new boa species on the island was in 1888.<br><br>“The fact that an animal could have gone undetected for so long on this island that has a lot of people on it is pretty remarkable,” says R. Graham Reynolds, a herpetologist at the University of North Carolina Asheville.<br><br>What’s more, the Hispaniolan vineboa may be <a href="https://bioone.org/journals/breviora/volume-571/issue-1/0006-9698-571.1.1/A-SMALL-NEW-ARBOREAL-SPECIES-OF-WEST-INDIAN-BOA-BOIDAE/10.3099/0006-9698-571.1.1.short">among the smallest boas in the world</a>, Reynolds, Landestoy and colleague Robert Henderson of the Milwaukee Public Museum report August 17 in <em>Breviora</em>. Adult boa species typically reach <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/blog/science-the-public/giant-snakes-warming-us-climes">2 meters or more in length</a> (<em>SN: 10/13/09</em>). The longest Hispaniolan vineboa that the team found, an adult female, measures less than 1 meter. The shortest, probably a juvenile male, is less than a half meter long.</p>



<p>Compared with the three other boa species found on the island, the Hispaniolan vineboa’s small size, large eyes and dark, zigzag patterned scales tipped off the researchers that they had spotted something new. Genetic analyses and close inspections five different snakes plus one shed skin confirmed the team’s hunch that the Hispaniolan vineboa is a species new to science.</p>



<p>But the species may already be in trouble. All serpents that the team found were within one kilometer of each other. That’s “a little bit alarming in the sense that they might be restricted to a very small area,” Reynolds says. Agricultural activities such as charcoal burning threaten the species’ habitat. The team’s next steps will be to figure out the boa’s true range and how big individuals can get.    </p>

                <p><em>By</em> <a href="https://emmayoung.net/">Emma Young</a></p>



<p>Much has been written about the downsides <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2020/12/02/coping-with-remote-working-during-covid-19-the-latest-research-digested/">of home-working</a>. <a href="https://news.stanford.edu/2021/02/23/four-causes-zoom-fatigue-solutions/">&#8220;Zoom fatigue&#8221;</a>, in particular, is now a term, and an experience, that many of us are familiar with. But the tiring effect of video chat could represent only one of its dangers, according to <a href="https://www.pnas.org/content/118/32/e2106640118.short?rss=1">new work</a> in <em>PNAS</em>. It finds that we ascribe less &#8220;mind&#8221; to people we see in image form, vs in the flesh, and even less again to images of images of people. There could be serious implications, write Paris Will at the University of British Columbia and colleagues: “Given that mind perception underpins moral judgement, our findings suggest that depicted persons will receive greater or lesser ethical consideration, depending on the level of abstraction.”</p>



<span id="more-43651"></span>



<p>When we assess the extent to which a creature or thing has a mind, we judge it on on two factors: &#8220;Experience&#8221; and &#8220;Agency&#8221;. Mental experience relates to conscious feelings<em> — </em>to feeling pain or happiness, for example; an animal judged to rank higher for Experience is generally judged to have more intrinsic moral worth as well. Agency, meanwhile, refers to the ability to actively do something — to act, to influence the course of events.</p>



<p>In a series of online and lab-based experiments, Will and colleagues explored how seeing a person in the flesh, versus in photo, versus in an image of a photo might affect participants’ judgements of that person’s levels of Experience and Agency as well as how &#8220;real&#8221; they seemed. In one experiment, for example, one group of participants compared a live face of a student volunteer against a life-size photograph of the face of another volunteer; a second group of participants looked at a photo showing the face of one volunteer who was also holding up a photo of the face of the other volunteer (both faces in this image were the same size). The team consistently found that greater abstraction was associated with lower judgements of Experience, Agency and Realness. In one experiment, they also found impacts on behaviour: participants in a version of the classic &#8220;<a href="https://psychology.wikia.org/wiki/Dictator_game">dictator game&#8221;</a> allocated significantly more money to recipients whose faces they saw in an image, compared with in an image of an image.</p>



<p>“It may not be surprising that mind perception differs for pictures versus reality,” the researchers write. “What is more surprising is that mind perception differs between pictures and pictures of pictures.” They dub this the &#8220;Medusa effect&#8221;, after the mythical Ancient Greek Gorgon who would turn a person into stone only if they looked at her directly, but not at her reflected image.</p>



<p>As the team notes, there has been a big shift in the past decade (and the last two pandemic years, especially) from face-to-face to online interaction. This clearly shifts the level of abstraction. All of the faces in their study were static, so it’s hard to know how movement of an image of face — as in a video chat — might affect perceptions of mind. But there are other contexts in which these specific results are directly applicable: the researchers point to photographic evidence in a virtual trial; visual materials presented by teachers in online lessons; and photos of victims shared by cyber-bullies. “In all of these settings, outcomes hinge on the sensitivity to the minds of others — precisely what is lost with an extra layer of abstraction.”</p>



<p>Future work might also explore individual differences in susceptibility to the Medusa effect. But for now, the work clearly suggests a new reason to be cautious about online vs real world interactions.</p>

<html><body><h2>PLOS and Plan S Price &amp; Service Transparency Framework 2020</h2>



<p>PLOS is committed to transparency in all its forms&mdash;from our Open Science practices that we urge our authors to adopt, to providing our community clear insight into our journals and activities. Last year, Plan S provided a pilot opportunity for the latter through their <a href="https://www.coalition-s.org/price-and-service-transparency-frameworks/">Price &amp; Service Transparency Framework</a> which becomes a requirement for Plan S compliance in July 2022. We have committed to participate in and <a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2020/10/plos-and-transparency-including-plan-s-price-service-transparency-framework/">share our reporting</a> from that framework each year and we are once again sharing our price transparency data in the <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1PO70hzf0YOJvH7WR4p2NLCok7znSeZBttPLGboczYR4/edit?usp=sharing">spreadsheet</a> and chart below. Read on for more details of how the framework has changed and what that means for PLOS.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Price Transparency Data 2020</strong></p>



<p>Since the original pilot<sup>1</sup> the framework has been adjusted and built upon to reflect feedback from publishers, librarians, and funders. The framework invites publishers to provide metrics of publication volume, acceptance rates, and time to decision; these are aimed to be comparable between different publishers. Those completing the framework must also divide their Article Processing Charge, per journal, into eight different services (those who followed along with last years&rsquo; report will note &lsquo;Platform development and support&rsquo; is a new addition this year). The categories are as follows:</p>



<ul><li><strong>Journal and Community Development</strong>, including commissioning content, researching editorial board members, and scope development</li><li><strong>Submission to desk reject or acceptance</strong></li><li><strong>Peer review management by staff/remunerated people</strong>, including management of submissions that are ultimately rejected</li><li><strong>Acceptance to publication</strong>, including typesetting, conversation, and production tasks</li><li><strong>Services after publication</strong>, including ethics checks and queries, usage statistics, long-term preservation and access monitoring</li><li><strong>Platform development and support</strong>, including systems development</li><li><strong>Sales &amp; marketing</strong> to customers or of articles, including marketing campaigns</li><li><strong>Author and customer support</strong>, including queries about licensing, citations, and author system troubleshooting</li></ul>



<p>PLOS&rsquo; price transparency breakdown (the third section of the framework) for 2020 is presented below. The breakdown is based on the 2020 APC price for a Research Article in each journal (data for our new titles will be provided from the year in which the first issue is published). We recognize APCs are not a perfect solution for all researchers and we are partnering with institutions to provide <a href="https://plos.org/resources/for-institutions/how-can-we-partner/">APC-alternative business models</a> for all of our journals, in addition to our<a href="https://plos.org/publish/fees/"> fee support options</a> that aim to provide authors of all funding backgrounds equitable opportunities to publish. We hope future iterations of the framework will enable us to represent this data alongside APCs.&nbsp;</p>



<p>.</p>

<p>While the categories listed above do encompass the breadth of activities PLOS undertakes in our publishing process, some nuance will be lost in any framework created to reflect all publishing houses or journals. Within our own portfolio of journals, for example, our editorial structures are varied to fit the needs of the type of research published in each title, and the needs of the authors within that community. The differences drive variance in the percentages of the APC value allocated at the &ldquo;initial triage&rdquo; and &ldquo;peer review management&rdquo; stages of each journal, most notably at <em>PLOS Biology</em>, <em>PLOS Medicine,</em> and <em>PLOS ONE</em> which rely on in-house editorial teams.</p>



<p>More detail on the operational differences of PLOS&rsquo; editorial models can be found in our <a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2020/10/plos-and-transparency-including-plan-s-price-service-transparency-framework/">previous transparency post</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Comparisons to our 2019 data</strong></p>



<p>The raw breakdown of our APCs across the services we provide has remained broadly consistent, however, the addition of the &lsquo;Platform development&rsquo; category to the framework this year has understandably affected the percentage breakdowns (this category had been previously included in the &lsquo;services after publication&rsquo; category).</p>



<p>As part of our ongoing commitment to article level metrics we <a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2020/08/plos-and-liblynx-partner-to-develop-open-access-analytics/">announced a partnership with Liblynx</a> to develop analytics that better communicate the usage and impact of Open Access content. Though not included in our report this year, we intend to provide COUNTER data as part of the 2022 framework.</p>



<p><strong>Investing in our communities</strong></p>



<p>As a nonprofit organization, PLOS does not seek revenue surplus purely for financial gain or as a return to shareholders. Our organizational activities are developed with the sole purpose of meeting the needs of researchers and reinvesting in the scholarly community in ways that support and further our <a href="https://plos.org/about/">mission</a>.</p>



<p>Many of those activities go beyond the breakdown you see here. Our highly regarded <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/s/staff-editors#loc-publication-ethics">publishing ethics team</a> works to raise awareness of publication ethics standards across the scholarly community, as well as developing policies and processes to further research integrity at our journals. We aim to help researchers increase the visibility and impact of their work by connecting authors to publication opportunities and career-building tools like our <a href="https://plos.org/resources/for-reviewers/">Peer Review</a> and <a href="https://plos.org/resources/writing-center/">Writing Centers</a>, and through dedicated media promotion of their published articles. Staff across the organization are also passionately involved in researching, developing and implementing<a href="https://plos.org/open-science/"> Open Science practices</a> at scale in order to make participation in the research ecosystem more transparent, efficient, and fair for researchers from all demographics, geographies, and disciplines.</p>



<p>For more information about our finances, PLOS provides an annual update on our <a href="https://plos.org/financial-overview/">financial overview</a> page. We&rsquo;ve also shared our pricing information for our emerging business models in our <a href="https://plos.org/resources/for-institutions/faqs/">FAQs</a>. And of course, we&rsquo;ll always share updates on our work and important milestones like this one through our blogs network.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/infant-laugh-babies-apes-evolution-bonding">Infants may laugh like some apes in their first months of life</a></h4>

              
                <p>Babies may laugh like some apes a few months after birth before transitioning to chuckling more like human adults, a new study finds.</p>



<p>Laughter links <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/tickling-apes-reveals-laughters-origins">humans to great apes, our evolutionary kin</a> (<em>SN: 6/4/09</em>). Human adults tend to laugh <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/human-laugh-lines-traced-back-ape-ancestors">while exhaling</a> (<em>SN: 6/10/15)</em>, but chimpanzees and bonobos mainly laugh in two ways. One is like panting, with sound produced on both in and out breaths, and the other has outbursts occurring on exhales, like human adults.</p>



<p>Less is known about how human babies laugh. So Mariska Kret, a cognitive psychologist at Leiden University in the Netherlands, and colleagues scoured the internet for videos with laughing 3- to 18-month-olds, and asked 15 speech sound specialists and thousands of novices to judge the babies’ laughs.</p>



<p>After evaluating dozens of short audio clips, experts and nonexperts alike found that <a href="https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rsbl.2021.0319">younger infants laughed during inhalation and exhalation</a>, while older infants laughed more on the exhale. That finding suggests that infants’ laughter becomes less apelike with age, the researchers report in the September <em>Biology Letters</em>.</p>





<p>Humans start to laugh around 3 months of age, but early on, “it hasn’t reached its full potential,” Kret says. Both babies’ maturing vocal tracts and their social interactions may influence the development of the sounds, the researchers say.</p>



<p>A second trial in the new study with different audio clips and a new group of 100 novices also found that older infants seemed to laugh mainly on exhales. And participants of both trials reported that the more adultlike laughs were more pleasing to hear and contagious. That second finding suggests that the shift in laughter as infants age may partly happen due to unconscious affirmations from the babies’ parents, Kret says. Laughs during exhalation are clearer and louder than during inhalation, she says, sending a stronger signal during interactions that may be better for bonding.</p>



<p>The idea that social interactions shape human babies’ laughs matches observations from chimpanzees, says Marina Davila Ross, a comparative psychologist at the University of Portsmouth in England who was not part of the new study. Davila Ross has found that among chimpanzees in different social groups, laughs can have somewhat different sounds and social functions. And humans and chimps alike adjust their laughs based on peers’ feedback, she says.</p>



<div class="wp-block-sciencenews-content-sidebar">
<h3>Baby giggles</h3>



<p>Babies’ laughs develop with time, from the short, panting chortles of a 4-month-old that occur during inhalation and exhalation (first clip) to an 18-month-old’s heart-melting giggles that occur mostly during exhalation (second clip), a new study suggests.</p>

</div>



<p>Still, the number of audio clips analyzed in the new study is small, making it difficult to discern trends, says D. Kimbrough Oller, a theoretical biologist at the University of Memphis in Tennessee who wasn’t involved in the research. All together, listeners in the study’s trials heard 108 clips of infants laughing, with each clip lasting four to seven seconds.</p>



<p>And while people may think that babies laugh a lot, Oller says, all-day recordings suggest babies rarely laugh. More often, they’re making other pre-speech sounds: “babbling, squeals, growls, raspberries — babies are producing those all day long.” The intense examples of laughter used in this study that were caught on camera probably aren’t all that representative, he says, so scientists should listen in all day to better understand the range of early laughter.</p>



<p>There’s also much more to laughter than breathing, Davila Ross says. Laughter can take on greater complexity with the vibration of vocal folds and a more melodious sound if vowels are heard.&nbsp; It’s not clear how these aspects of human infants’ and apes’ laughs compare, she says, and a more thorough analysis would examine the structure of laughs’ sound waves.<br><br>Reading into laughter’s pleasantness could also be problematic, says Carolyn McGettigan, a psychologist and cognitive neuroscientist at University College London. What people rate as enjoyable may be tangled up with how they perceive kids’ ages. Individuals may, for example, enjoy older infants’ laughs more if they think toddlers are more fun than young infants.</p>



<p>Still, the research provides a good starting place, she says. “Studying these kinds of infant vocal behaviors gives us this window into the evolution of what we can do with our voices.”&nbsp;</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/clouds-wildfire-smoke-rain-climate">Clouds affected by wildfire smoke may produce less rain</a></h4>

              
                <p>When smoke rises from wildfires in the western United States, it pummels clouds with tiny airborne particles. What happens next with these clouds has been largely unstudied. But during the 2018 wildfire season, researchers embarked on a series of seven research flights, including over the Pacific Northwest, to help fill this gap.</p>



<p>Using airborne instruments to analyze small cumulus clouds affected by the smoke, the scientists found that these clouds contained, on average, five times as many water droplets as unaffected clouds. That in itself was not a huge surprise; it’s known that <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/willdfire-thunder-pyro-clouds-aerosols-volcanic-eruptions">organic and inorganic particles in smoke</a> can serve as tiny nuclei for forming droplets (<em>SN: 12/15/20</em>). But the sheer abundance of droplets in the affected clouds astounded the team.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Counterintuitively, those numerous droplets didn’t make the clouds more likely to produce rain. In fact, the opposite occurred. Because the droplets were about half as big as those found in a typical cloud, <a href="https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/2021GL094224">they were unlikely to collide and merge with enough other droplets</a> to result in rain. The chances of rain were “virtually zero,” the researchers write in the August <em>Geophysical Research Letters.</em></p>



<p>The new research suggests that wildfires could lead to clouds producing less rain in the U.S. West, feeding into drought conditions and potentially increasing future wildfire risk.</p>





<p>But the environmental dynamics involved are complex, says Cynthia Twohy. She’s a San Diego–based atmospheric scientist at NorthWest Research Associates, a research organization specializing in geophysical and space sciences headquartered in Redmond, Wash. For instance, Twohy and her colleagues found that “the ratio of light-absorbing to light-scattering particles in the smoke was somewhat lower than measured in many prior studies,” she says. &nbsp;</p>



<p>“The take-home message is that while other studies have shown wildfire smoke has an absorbing (warming) influence that can be important for cloud formation and development, these impacts may be less in the western U.S., because the smoke is not as dark,” Twohy says. The impact of the lighter smoke is still an open question. “It&#8217;s just another way that smoke-cloud interactions are a wild card in the region.” &nbsp;</p>



<p>The team used onboard probes to sample clouds affected by wildfire smoke and compare them to their more pristine counterparts. The probes measured how many cloud droplets were present in the samples, the size range of those droplets and the liquid water content of the clouds.</p>



<p>A special tube mounted on the exterior of the plane to collect and evaporate cloud droplets was used to “reveal the particles that the droplets were condensed on,” says Robert Yokelson, an atmospheric chemist at the University of Montana in Missoula who was not involved with the research. This process enabled the researchers to confirm what the original smoke particles were made of, a technique that Yokelson calls “neat.”</p>



<p>The analysis detected the amounts of carbon, oxygen, nitrogen, sulfur and potassium found in residual particles evaporated from cloud droplets. These elements were present in similar amounts to those found in smoke particles sampled from below the clouds, “implying that the cloud droplets also formed on smoke particles,” Twohy says.</p>



<p>Previous studies conducted in the Amazon have shown that &#8220;smoke will make the cloud droplets smaller and more numerous,&#8221; thereby&nbsp;reducing rainfall, Yokelson says. But this study provides robust evidence that the phenomenon isn&#8217;t isolated&nbsp;to the Amazon. It echoes the results of a much smaller 1974 study of smoke-filled clouds over the western United States, providing a crucial present-day snapshot of the challenges facing the region.</p>



<p>Wildfires in the western United States<a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/climate-change-wildfires-heat-waves-hurricanes-records-2020"> have been breaking records in recent years</a> — increasing in number and size due to climate change — a trend that scientists think will get worse as the globe continues to warm (<em>SN: 12/21/20</em>). As a result, Twohy says, it’s increasingly important that researchers continue to monitor these fires’ influence on the atmosphere.</p>

                <p><em>By </em><a href="https://twitter.com/E_Barratt">Emma L. Barratt</a></p>



<p>Around one in five of those who have recovered from Covid-19 report ongoing symptoms, also known as long Covid. Experiences with this new condition are varied, and several symptoms are neuropsychological in nature.</p>



<p>One such symptom is brain fog. Though not a medical diagnosis in itself, this term is recognised by many health professionals, and refers to a fluctuating and varied set of symptoms which severely affect the sufferer’s ability to think clearly, or conduct their lives as they previously have.</p>



<p>Brain fog is often thought of as a benign, non-specific symptom, and in some circles is even dismissed as malingering. But in fact, it’s a symptom widely associated with chemotherapy, an issue for 40% of those with HIV, and source of frustration for many during pregnancy, amongst other medical conditions. Several neurological mechanisms have been proposed, but as of yet scientists don’t agree on the exact physical cause. As such, research looking into this after-effect of Covid is likely to garner a wide array of responses.</p>



<p>At this stage, understanding the experience of brain fog in long Covid is important — in order to tackle a new condition, researchers must first obtain a thorough description of the problem. This is the starting point from which further research can truly begin. To this end, researchers based at Oxford University recruited 50 participants from previous long Covid studies and online long Covid support groups to participate in remotely-held focus groups.</p>



<span id="more-43635"></span>



<p><a href="https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.08.07.21261740v1">Their pre-print</a> details qualitative data gathered over the course of these focus groups, held in October and November 2020, during which participants discussed both their own symptoms, and commented on others’ experiences with brain fog following Covid.</p>



<p>Members of the focus group often described neurocognitive symptoms consistent with deficits in executive function, attention, memory, and language, amongst other domains. With such a wide range of cognitive capacities affected, participants consistently described day-to-day functioning as severely impacted. One participant noted that shopping in supermarkets had become surprisingly difficult, due in part to what they described as sensory overload. “It’s planning, it’s getting there, it’s choosing stuff. All of that is actually really difficult.”</p>



<p>Another participant (a doctor) reported that they now struggled to deal with multitasking, feeling unable to cope with “multiple inputs”. In professions that demand such a high level of metaphorical plate-spinning, brain fog is likely to have a profound impact not only on productivity, but employment stability, and even the experiences of those they work with. Those in the sample who had been able to return to work spoke of adapting their roles, reducing hours, or relying on someone to check their work for errors. This gave rise to feelings of anxiety and self-doubt, as well of a loss of self-worth and altered identity.</p>



<p>Participants reported feelings of extreme fatigue; physical or mental effort typically triggered a decline in neurocognitive symptoms, which one participant reported having to manage via a &#8220;traffic light&#8221; system. “Green’s fine, [my partner] can just talk business at me. Amber is [&#8230;] ‘what’s the weather like’ kind of conversation, and then red is just ‘stop, I need to just rest. Stop all the sensory input coming in’.” Further non-cognitive symptoms, such as tachycardia and breathlessness, were highlighted by a large portion of the sample as occurring in tandem with brain fog, or in response to cognitive effort. Several participants also highlighted trouble with interpersonal relationships which had arisen from these widespread cognitive difficulties.</p>



<p>This unfortunately also translates to extensive difficulties obtaining appropriate support from the healthcare system. Similar to other hidden or fluctuating disabilities, dismissive attitudes from physicians prompted feelings of frustration, anger, and hopelessness for participants. While some participants experienced validation and relief after speaking with medical professionals, many felt that their symptoms were dismissed as &#8220;all in [their] head&#8221;, and often found themselves with little continuity of care, speaking to a different person every time they went to get help.  They also noted struggling to effectively communicate their experiences through brain fog symptoms during medical appointments, repeatedly having to attempt to rapidly re-explain extensive cognitive issues within the given 10-minute consultation window.</p>



<p>The majority of participants reported that their brain fog symptoms became evident about one to four months after their bout of Covid. Encouragingly, most of the sample also reported that their symptoms were improving during follow up interviews four to six months after the first. However, this was not the case for the whole sample. It’s worth noting here that our understanding of long Covid is relatively immature, and that cases of brain fog triggered by other conditions can persist for years on end.</p>



<p>Though the group noted that the term “brain fog” is often useful as shorthand, and recognised by many medical professionals, they were mixed in their endorsement of it as an appropriate term. Many felt that it lacks specificity, or doesn’t fully convey the severity of the symptoms they experience. One participant stated that even those who understand what brain fog refers to mostly fail to comprehend the extreme amount of difficulty it introduces into everyday functioning. “[There] just doesn’t seem to be the understanding there. And I can understand that, because it would be beyond my comprehension as well if I hadn’t lived it.”</p>



<p>This paper sets out a clear argument for the development of specialist services comprising interdisciplinary medical professionals, including physicians, clinical psychologists, and occupational therapists. These services must be easily navigable and accessible in ways that traditional primary care currently fails to be for patients with brain fog. It also shows that there is a stark and urgent need for focused training for primary care physicians on the functional, professional, and social impacts of cognitive dysfunction following Covid.  </p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/ants-metal-infused-sharp-jaws-biology">How metal-infused jaws give some ants an exceptionally sharp bite</a></h4>

              
                <p>If you’ve ever felt the wrath of a biting or stinging insect, it may seem incredible that something so small can so easily slice or puncture human skin.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Scientists already knew that some small animals’ piercing and slashing body parts are infused with metals such as zinc and manganese, making the parts tough and durable. Now, a study published September 1 in <em>Scientific Reports</em> shows <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-021-91795-y">how these toollike appendages form hard and extremely sharp cutting edges</a>.</p>



<p>Robert Schofield, a physicist at the University of Oregon in Eugene, and colleagues used a special microscope to examine the sharp “teeth” that line the jaws of <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/leaf-cutting-ant-body-armor-mineral-exoskeleton-fight">leaf-cutting ants</a> called <em>Atta cephalotes</em>, revealing the teeth’s atomic structure (<em>SN: 11/24/20</em>). The team found that zinc atoms were dispersed homogeneously, rather than in chunks, throughout a single tooth. This uniformity allows the ants to grow much thinner, sharper blades, since “chunks of mineral limit how sharp the tool can be,” Schofield says.</p>



<p>The team also tested a suite of properties of these metal-infused materials, known as heavy element biomaterials, in ant teeth, spider fangs, scorpion stingers and marine worm jaws, among others. These structures are stiffer and more damage resistant than biomineralized materials, like the calcium phosphate typically found in teeth or the combination of calcium carbonate and the protein chitin in many arthropod shells, the team found. The metal-fortified body parts have “the kinds of properties that you want in a knife or needle,” Schofield says.</p>



<p>The team estimates that the zinc-infused teeth of <em>A. cephalotes</em> allow it to puncture and cut using only about 60 percent of the energy and muscle mass it would otherwise.&nbsp;</p>



<p>By making these sharp, precisely sculpted tools, ants and other small animals can make up for their tiny muscles, allowing them to acquire and process foods that would normally be beyond their reach.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/cold-plasma-agriculture-sustainable-farms-fertilizer">Cold plasma could transform the sustainable farms of the future</a></h4>

              
                <p>Physicist Stephan Reuter of Polytechnique Montréal spends most days using his expertise in energy and matter to improve medical technologies. Recently though, he stood in a sea of green to consider how a shower of charged particles might affect lettuce.</p>



<p>He had been invited to one of the largest commercial greenhouses in Quebec to help the growers rethink the energy of agriculture. Inside the building, encased by glass walls and covering more ground than four soccer fields, thousands upon thousands of lettuce plants floated on polystyrene mats in a hydroponic, or no-soil, growing system. The crop was nearly ready to be picked, packaged and shipped. Reuter’s task was to use physics to help the company, Hydroserre Inc. in Mirabel, reduce its carbon footprint.</p>



<p>To that end, the company is interested in finding new ways to fight pathogens and to deliver fertilizer to the growing plants. Many fertilizers contain ammonia, which is produced from nitrogen (necessary for plant growth) and hydrogen using a chemical reaction called the Haber-Bosch process. This process revolutionized agriculture in the early 20th century by making mass production of fertilizer possible. However, the process yields hundreds of millions of metric tons of carbon dioxide each year.</p>



<p>“Ideally, we want a fertilizer that’s renewable,” Reuter says. And to make it truly green, it should be created at the farm, making transport, another carbon emitter, unnecessary. Reuter and a growing number of chemists, physicists and engineers think they can see how to make that happen. These researchers are working toward future farms that are truly sustainable, where the energy from renewable sources like wind or solar is harnessed to make an efficient fertilizer on-site. They hope to realize this vision by exploiting plasma.</p>





<h4>Plasma everywhere</h4>



<p>Reuter might seem an unlikely consultant for an agricultural challenge. After all, his expertise is in the physics of plasma, one of the four fundamental states of matter, along with solids, liquids and gases.</p>



<p>Plasma is remarkably common. In fact, most matter seen in the known universe — more than 99.9 percent, according to astrophysicists — is in a plasma state. Lightning produces plasma. So do those inexpensive novelty lamps in museum gift shops. Switch on the power, and an electrode at the sphere’s center produces a high voltage that interacts with the gas sealed inside the glass to form tendrils of colored plasma that radiate outward. Touch the glass, and the plasma tendrils seem to reach toward your fingers.</p>



<p>The sun is a ball of plasma and gas. The <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/nasa-parker-solar-probe-reveals-sun-plasma-waves-magnetic-islands">solar wind is a stream of plasma</a> that peels off the sun (<em>SN: 12/21/19 </em>&amp; <em>1/4/20, p. 6</em>). When that wind collides with the protective, plasma-rich magnetic cushion that envelopes Earth, the interactions produce rivers of light seen in the aurora borealis and aurora australis.</p>



<p>Plasma is also a workhorse of modern technology. Engineers use it to etch the millions of tiny transistors found on the chips in today’s computers, cars and musical birthday cards. The pixels in plasma televisions contain gas that forms a plasma, sealed inside tiny cells sandwiched between two glass plates, and neon signs and fluorescent lights glow because of plasma. Some former astronauts even predict that plasma engines will someday propel us to Mars.</p>



<p>But what exactly is plasma? It’s a soup of electrons with their negative charges, positive ions and neutral atoms that also produces electromagnetic fields and ultraviolet and infrared radiation. Plasma comes about when gas gets super energized — by heat or an electric current, for example — and electrons are freed from atoms.</p>



<p>Plasmas occur naturally or can be human-made. When produced by high temperatures, such as in the sun, it’s called “hot plasma,” while the plasma created in a plasma ball and other room-temperature, low-pressure environments is called “cold plasma.” Plasma balls make it easy to see: They’re filled with a gaseous mixture that includes one of the very stable, noble gases, like argon, xenon, neon or krypton. Plasma makes up those glowing tendrils that reach out from the center. The high-frequency current excites electrons that then separate from the atoms of gas. Many agricultural experiments include a mix of noble gases and air to yield ions of nitrogen and oxygen.</p>

<p>Scientists have long been interested in plasma’s biological implications. In the late 19th century, the Finnish physicist Karl Selim Lemström observed that the width of growth rings in fir trees near the Arctic Circle followed the cycle of the aurora borealis, widening when the northern lights were strongest. He hypothesized that the light show somehow encouraged plant growth. To artificially emulate the northern lights, he placed a metal wire net over growing plants and ran a current through it. Under the right conditions, he reported, the treatment produced larger vegetable yields.</p>



<p>For decades, scientists have known that exposure to plasma can safely kill pathogenic bacteria, fungi and viruses. Small studies in animals also suggest that plasma can prompt the growth of blood vessels in skin. In his research, Reuter studies ways to harness these properties to inhibit new infections in wounds and expedite healing or treat other skin conditions. But more recently, he and other physicists have been working on ways to use the power of plasma to improve food production.</p>



<p>Experiments conducted in the last decade or so have tested a mix of ways to apply plasma to seeds, seedlings, crops and fields. These include plasma generated using noble gases, as well as plasma generated from air. In some cases, plasma is directly applied through plasma “jets” that stream over the seeds or plants. Another approach uses plasma-treated water that can do double duty: irrigation and fertilization. Some studies have reported a range of benefits, from helping plants grow faster and bigger to resisting pests.</p>



<p>“Even in this very, very early stage of research that we’re at with plasma, which has really only come into its own in the last 10 to 15 years, we’re seeing very promising data,” says plant pathologist Brendan Niemira at the Food Safety and Intervention Technologies Research unit at the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Eastern Regional Research Center in Wyndmoor, Pa. He’s a fan of the approach: On Zoom, Niemira’s avatar shows an almond basking in an eerie, purple plasma glow.</p>



<p>The challenge now, he says, is to figure out whether plasma can deliver at the level of hectares of crops. “Can we make it work in a field environment [to] deliver an advantage that can be integrated into grow systems in the future?”</p>



<p>Nested within that challenge are many others, including finding a way to deliver plasma to plants on a large scale, confirming benefits reported in lab studies and showing that plasma is better than current methods. And, finally, figuring out what the charged soup of plasma is actually doing to plants.</p>



<p>Recent advances became possible, Niemira says, largely because in the 1990s and early 2000s, scientists developed efficient and cost-effective ways to generate cold plasmas by streaming high-energy electrons into a gas. Those electrons would collide with gas molecules, knocking off electrons and producing charged particles. Since then, he says, there’s been something of a rush to test plasma on plants at all stages of growth and with a range of strategies.</p>

<h3>Two paths </h3>



<p>Researchers are investigating a range of potential agricultural benefits from plasma. Some studies suggest plasma boosts plant growth and yield. Others show that plasma also might have a role in preserving food by eliminating pathogenic bacteria and fungi from plant surfaces. </p>

<h4>Surface changes</h4>



<p>One of the most appealing uses of plasma, according to Reuter, is as a fertilizer alternative to ammonia. His plan for the Mirabel greenhouse project, which he helped launch in spring 2021 with scientists from the Quebec-based nonprofit IRDA, or Research and Development Institute for the Agri-Environment, goes something like this: The plasma is generated by sending an electric current through a gas that, ideally, is just air. That process creates a mix of charged and neutral particles, including electrons and ions, that can produce reactive species of nitrogen and oxygen. In tabletop experiments and then in the greenhouse, Reuter and his colleagues will enrich water with plasma, then study whether it can reduce pathogens and affect the growing plants.</p>



<p>Reactive species, as the name implies, are ready to react with atoms and molecules, including in living things, and are biologically available to plants. When the plasma is added to the water, those reactive species dissolve. The resulting plasma-infused water, with its biologically available nitrogen, will then be used to irrigate the plants. It will do the same job as ammonia: Nitrogen, which plants require for growth, is delivered as ions, excited molecules and compounds in the water. While heavy doses of reactive species can harm plant cells or DNA, the amount in plasma-treated water has been shown to be safe for the plant, Reuter says.</p>

Reuter</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>Experiments led by biochemist Alexander Volkov of Oakwood University in Huntsville, Ala., offer another example of the kind of research going on in plasma agriculture. Volkov studies the ways in which plants and electromagnetism interact. For example, he’s shown how <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2634039/">an electric stimulus can trigge</a>r the closing mechanism on a Venus flytrap.</p>



<p>Recently, Volkov set out to study how plasma would affect 20 seeds of dragon’s-tongue, a cultivar of the bush bean <em>Phaseolus vulgaris</em>. The experiment was low-tech. He and colleagues balanced the seeds on a plasma ball for one minute each, then incubated the seeds in water for seven hours. Two days later, the scientists found that in plasma-treated seeds, the radicle — the little protrusion of root that makes a seed a seedling — measured 2.7 centimeters, compared with 1.8 centimeters in untreated seeds, <a href="https://www.publish.csiro.au/FP/FP20293">a gain of 50 percent</a>. The team reported the results in <em>Functional Plant Biology</em> in February 2021.</p>



<div class="wp-block-sciencenews-content-sidebar">
<h3>Roots emerge&nbsp;</h3>



<p>Biochemist Alexander Volkov and colleagues exposed bush bean seeds to plasma jets, then immersed the seeds in water for a day. Two days later, plasma-treated seeds showed larger radicles, or starter roots. The least growth occurred in untreated seeds. The others received plasma for 30 seconds, one minute, five minutes and 15 minutes (shown below). Using a plasma globe, he got less striking results.</p>

<p>Less than a centimeter of extra growth may seem modest, but Volkov was encouraged. The benefit couldn’t have come from the reactive species of nitrogen and oxygen because they can’t exit the glass sphere, but somehow, the treated seeds seemed to take up more water to grow faster.</p>



<p>To investigate that idea, he and colleagues studied the seeds using an atomic force microscope and magnetic resonance imaging, which reveals how tissues take up water. At the micrometer-level view of the atomic force microscope, Volkov saw that exposure had roughed up the surface of the seeds. The images looked like carved mountain ranges. Those ridges gave the water more surface area to glom on to, and more openings through which to soak the inside of the seeds, he hypothesized. MRI images of treated beans showed larger swaths of white — indicating more water inside — than untreated beans.</p>



<p>“When we use the plasma balls or lamps, the water can penetrate easily through the pores and accelerate germination,” he says.</p>

<h4>Growing evidence</h4>



<p>Physicist Nevena Puač of the Institute of Physics Belgrade in Serbia has performed dozens of studies testing plasma on plants and has been working in the field for decades. She says most studies — successful or not — have tested two ideas: plasma as a disinfectant or as a growth instigator.</p>



<p>On the disinfecting front, plasma jet treatments of less than a minute on foods including apples, cherry tomatoes and lettuce can reduce disease-causing bacteria, such as <em>Escherichia coli</em>, <em>Salmonella </em>and <em>Listeria</em>. Some studies have looked at higher exposure times as well: In a 2008 study, five minutes of plasma treatment inactivated 90 percent of pathogenic <em>Aspergillus parasiticus</em> fungi on hazelnuts, peanuts and pistachios.</p>



<p>This is the research branch that Niemira works on as well. In May 2019 in <em>LWT–Food Science and Technology</em>, he and colleagues showed that <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.lwt.2018.12.049">plasma treatment combined with an existing sanitizer killed 99.9 percent of <em>Listeria</em> on apples in under four minutes</a>. Working alone, the sanitizer achieved comparable results after an hour. The combination works much better than either one could possibly work alone, he says.</p>



<p>Investigations on seed germination and plant growth are similarly promising. Researchers at the Chinese Academy of Sciences in Nanjing exposed soybean seeds to plasma. Seven days after exposure, the roots were up to 27 percent heavier than roots from untreated seeds, the team reported in 2014. The same year, researchers in Romania reported similar gains for radish roots and sprouts.</p>



<p>At last year’s Gaseous Electronics Conference, hosted online by the American Physical Society, researchers from Japan presented results from a study of young seedlings treated directly with plasma and with plasma-treated water in a rice paddy in the Aichi prefecture. Plants treated directly with plasma early in the growth process had up to a 15 percent higher yield than untreated plants. But treating plants late in the growth process lowered the yield. Timing matters, Puač says. So does the application method: In some cases in the experiments in Japan, plasma-treated water actually lowered the yield.</p>



<p>“To my knowledge this was the first study where plants were treated directly,” rather than as seeds or after harvest for disinfection, says engineer Katharina Stapelmann of North Carolina State University in Raleigh, who organized the session.</p>



<p>Studies have connected plasma treatment to a range of benefits, Puač says, from growth rate to yield. But other studies suggest that plasma won’t ever be a one-size-fits-all technology.</p>



<p>Researchers in South Korea reported in the <em>Journal of Physics D: Applied Physics</em> in 2020, for example, that while a six-minute plasma exposure boosted germination rates of barley sprouts, an 18-minute exposure, over three days, produced no benefit in growth and lowered total plant weight. Experimental results published in 2000 looked at the effects of direct plasma jets on peas, corn and radishes and found detrimental effects that varied by the gas used in the plasma. The seeds were exposed for two to 20 minutes, and seeds with prolonged exposure were slower to germinate than untreated seeds.</p>

<p>What the research shows, Reuter says, is that before plasma becomes a staple on farms around the world, scientists need to better understand the myriad ways that the fourth state of matter could affect plants.</p>



<p>For instance, successful outcomes for plants might be due in part to the UV radiation produced by plasma; UV radiation has long been used as a disinfectant. The reactive nitrogen and oxygen species, which can be helpful or harmful to living cells depending on how they’re used, probably help as nutrients and disinfectants, as well. Plasma also produces electric and magnetic fields and infrared and visible light. Their impact on plants also hasn’t been fully explored. Even though researchers know what’s in the plasma, and can see how the plants respond, they don’t have the details mapped out, Volkov says.</p>



<h4>Gardens big and small</h4>



<p>Projects are under way around the world to test plasma on large scales and in different settings. Dutch scientists working in Uganda have developed portable “reactors” that use plasma to generate fertilizers from the air. They hope this invention can meet the need for fertilizers in places where farmers often can’t get ammonia. Early in 2022, Reuter hopes to report his first results from desktop experiments. The hydroponic growing system at Hydroserre will provide him with the opportunity to refine his method.</p>



<p>With any luck, he says, the project will show a way for future farms to replace ammonia and reduce carbon emissions.</p>



<p>While researchers and growers await those results, citizen scientists, amateur physicists and experimental gardeners have been known to make space in the shed for a plasma ball next to their rakes and shovels, to run their own experiments at home.</p>



<p>Volkov has jumped in. When the pandemic shut down his lab last year, he took his work — and his plasma balls — home. He bathed the vegetable seeds for his garden for a minute in the lamp’s rich, purplish glow, and then planted them.</p>



<p>“It was cucumber, tomatoes, eggplants, cabbage,” he says. A backyard test run isn’t proof of anything, Volkov readily acknowledges, and any gardener can attest that a finicky combination of variables can make or break a garden.</p>



<p>But he did see an astounding harvest last fall. By late October, he was still picking big, ripe tomatoes from the vines grown from plasma-treated seeds, at a time when the plants from untreated seeds have often withered. The cucumbers were bigger and juicier. The cabbages, planted in a friend’s nursery, were heavier and more delicious, he says. “I got a fantastic amount of everything.”</p>

                <p><em>By </em><a href="http://emilyoliviareynolds.com/">Emily Reynolds</a></p>



<p>The media plays a huge part in shaping our understanding of the world, including how we respond to other people. Coverage of immigration is no different, and previous <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/1369183X.2017.1412253">research</a> has suggested that even subtle changes in language and framing can change the way people think about immigrants.</p>



<p>A <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-021-95800-2">new study</a>, published in <em>Scientific Reports</em>, looks at the real life impact of negative media portrayals of immigrants. It finds that negative coverage can increase hostility towards immigrants and favouritism towards members of the non-immigrant in-group — which can have serious financial, emotional and social consequences for communities.</p>



<span id="more-43583"></span>



<p>The first study involved 350 Italian students, some of whom first watched a TV report about immigration. In one condition, participants saw a negative report, which argued that immigration was costly and a threat to the cultural identity of non-immigrants; in another immigrants were portrayed as a positive resource and opportunity to enrich the local culture. Those in the third group watched no video at all. Before and after watching the video, participants gave a sample of their saliva.</p>



<p>Next, participants completed measures relating to their perception of the threat immigration poses, how anxious they felt engaging with immigrants, and how they felt about the video. The game element of the study then began, with participants taking part in a &#8220;trust game&#8221; designed to measure trust, and a &#8220;dictator game&#8221; designed to measure altruism.</p>



<p>In the trust game, the participants were given ten euros and asked how much they wanted to send to another person. This amount would then be tripled, and the “trustee” would then send a portion of the money back (so, in theory, the participant could make a higher amount of money if they trusted the receiver to send a substantial portion back). Participants played both as the sender and the receiver at different points of the study. In the dictator game, participants were again asked to send a portion of ten euros to a receiver or to receive money themselves, only this time no money was sent back.</p>



<p>Importantly, some participants saw a list of their partners in the game that consisted of distinctly Italian names; some saw a mixture of Italian names and names that suggested their partners were immigrants; and some saw no names.</p>



<p>The results showed that participants who watched the negative video were more altruistic towards those with traditionally Italian names than to those with names that sounded as if they belonged to immigrants. There was also some evidence that they were less likely to trust those they believed were immigrants (by sending them less money in the trust game). The negative video was also associated with increased perceptions of immigration as a threat, and with increased testosterone-cortisol ratio, which can indicate higher levels of stress and aggression.</p>



<p>A second study replicated these methods, only this time participants shared demographic data and completed measures of political orientation, how likely they are to give gifts, and subtle and blatant prejudice towards immigration and immigrants. They then watched the videos and completed the games as in the first study. Finally, participants answered questions on outgroup threat, how much they believed immigrants represent a health risk for the Italian population, and anxiety around engaging with immigrants.</p>



<p>In this case, those who watched the negative video were less likely to behave in a trusting way towards those with non-Italian sounding names compared to those with traditional Italian names. Unsurprisingly, left- and right-wing participants exhibited different levels of trust towards immigrants: right-wing respondents who saw the negative video were less likely to trust immigrants, while there was no effect of the video for left-wing respondents. Similarly, those who displayed blatant and subtle prejudices were less likely to feel trust towards immigrants after watching the negative video, but there was no effect of the video for those with low levels of prejudice.</p>



<p>So, the results suggest, anti-immigrant media coverage can have a serious impact. Responses were threefold: emotional, through increased anxiety; physiological, through markers of stressed or aggressive responses; and material, through the reduced likelihood of sharing money. Prosocial behaviour towards non-immigrants, however, <em>increased</em>, suggesting again that immigrants could lose out in a society primed to reject and exclude them.</p>



<p>The fact that the positive video had no significant effect was also a key insight; the team suggests this may have been because of a bias towards remembering or being impacted by negative messaging. Thinking carefully about how to counter this negative bias could therefore be a key way of reducing the anti-immigrant sentiments all too prevalent in the media today.</p>



<p>&#8211; <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-021-95800-2">Negative media portrayals of immigrants increase ingroup favoritism and hostile physiological and emotional reactions</a></p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/chocolate-tempering-saturated-fat-phospholipid-chemistry">A pinch of saturated fat could make tempering chocolate a breeze</a></h4>

              
                <p>Glossy, velvety chocolate that snaps in the fingers and melts in the mouth is the chocolatier’s dream.</p>



<p>But crafting cocoa confections with this optimal texture is no easy feat. The endeavor, known as tempering, demands carefully warming and cooling liquid chocolate until it crystallizes into its most delectable form. Now, scientists may have found a shortcut: adding <a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-021-25206-1">a small pinch of fatty molecules</a> called phospholipids, researchers report August 31 in <em>Nature Communications</em>.</p>



<p>With phospholipids, “you can simplify the whole tempering process, making sure you always have the right quality of the chocolate,” says food chemist Alejandro Marangoni of the University of Guelph in Canada.</p>



<p>Curious about what occurs on a molecular level during tempering, Marangoni and colleagues focused on the ingredient that gives chocolate its texture — cocoa butter. While previous tempering research had targeted cocoa butter’s main component, triglycerides, the team set its sights on a different sweet spot: the minor components, which include free fatty acids and phospholipids. Removing these minor components from the cocoa butter and adding them back in one by one allowed the researchers to figure out each component’s role during tempering.</p>





<p>With just a pinch of phospholipids added to the cocoa butter — achieving a weight concentration of 0.1 percent of the chocolate’s total — the mixture rapidly crystallized into the elusive, melt-in-the-mouth texture. The process required a single cooling to 20˚ Celsius rather than multiple heating and cooling cycles as tempering typically demands.</p>



<p>Next, the team increased the phospholipid weight concentration in melted dark chocolate by an extra 0.1 percent, and easily produced high-quality textures again. The result suggests that phospholipids could be used to simplify chocolate tempering.</p>



<p>The hack could help small-scale chocolatiers avoid the complications and expenses associated with tempering machines, Marangoni says. Large-scale manufacturers, on the other hand, would need to figure out how to evenly disperse phospholipids in a large vat of molten chocolate, he says.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2021/09/07/hand-gestures-help-students-mentally-organise-new-information/">Hand Gestures Help Students Mentally Organise New Information</a></h4>

              
                <p><em>By </em><a href="https://twitter.com/E_Barratt">Emma L. Barratt</a></p>



<p>Retaining new information can be tricky, especially with topics far outside of what we’re familiar with. A good teacher can make a huge difference, but effective teaching techniques can add new dimensions to our ability to really take on what we’re being told.</p>



<p>A <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/acp.3866?af=R">new study</a> by academics from the University of California and University of Georgia identifies one such technique, and it turns out to be incredibly simple: hand gestures.</p>



<span id="more-43574"></span>



<p>The team wanted to know if gestures used by teachers could assist in mental organisation of new information, and help students retain and understand lesson content. To do this, they devised two experiments, looking specifically at two types of hand motion: structure gestures, which indicated which of two groups was being discussed by gestures made to the left or right, and surface gestures, which illustrated physical characteristics.</p>



<p>In the first experiment, student participants (N=123) were shown one of four videos depicting an instructor using one, both, or neither of these types of gestures to embellish their lesson on steamboats. Structure gestures — moving their hands to the left or right — were used to indicate whether they were discussing eastern or western steamboats, respectively. Surface gestures, on the other hand, were used to indicate physical features about the depth of the hull, with the instructor moving their hands apart or together to illustrate comparative depths.</p>



<p>Once the video lesson was complete, the students were given a series of computer-based tasks which probed their retention of the lesson material. During recall and matching tasks, students were asked to write a summary of the lesson they had received and match a set of facts to their respective steamboat vehicles.</p>



<p>Students also completed an inference test, where they were asked to make connections between different steamboat characteristics, answering questions like “If a steamboat operates on a shallow river, what does that tell you about the pressure of the steamboat’s engine?” This test in particular was chosen as a good measure of whether students had constructed a well-organised mental representation of their new steamboat knowledge, because it requires an amount of mental manipulation, as opposed to just an ability to recall lesson content.</p>



<p>The team found that students who had seen the lesson with structure gestures scored significantly higher in inference tests. This suggests that physical gestures allocating spoken information into physical spaces helps students to better construct an organised mental framework of lesson material, from which they could make accurate inferences.</p>



<p>However, gestures aren’t a silver bullet for everything. Neither structure nor surface gestures improved basic recall of the material. Similarly, participants who saw surface gestures showed no difference in their inference scores compared to those who didn’t.</p>



<p>The researchers built on these findings in a second experiment which took much the same form. This time, however, the videos were much more complex. Focusing on innate and adaptive immunity, the lessons contained nearly twice as many words and included many more comparisons than the steamboat lesson.</p>



<p>Even though these lessons were significantly more complex to follow, the results were similarly promising. Once again, structure gestures that divided innate and adaptive immunity using left and right gestures, respectively, significantly boosted student (N=170) scores in the inference test portion. And, as with experiment number one, surface gestures — which consisted of placing hands further apart or closer to indicate how specific an immune response is — did not assist with inference scores. Neither gesture improved overall recall of the material.</p>



<p>The researchers believe that these findings are in line with the previously proposed construction-integration model of learning, and that left/right structure gestures provided a scaffold upon which students could better build links between lesson content. In future research, there’s scope to explore how this technique can be applied to other types of gestures beyond those used for simple comparisons, as well as verifying that this effect can be generalised to the classroom, where attention may be more easily distracted.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/earthquake-pictogram-oldest-known-account-americas">This pictogram is one of the oldest known accounts of earthquakes in the Americas</a></h4>

              
                <p>A 50-page codex of colorful, complex pictograms that dates to the early 16th century includes the most complete — and one of the oldest — written chronologies of early earthquakes in the Americas.</p>



<p>The <em>Telleriano-Remensis</em>, which was created by an unknown pre-Hispanic civilization, describes 12 separate <a href="https://doi.org/10.1785/0220210161">earthquakes that rocked what’s now Mexico and Central America from 1460 to 1542</a>, researchers report August 25 in <em>Seismological Research Letters</em>. The famous codex was written by specialists called <em>tlacuilos</em>, meaning “those who write painting” in the Nahuatl language spoken by <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/ancient-ball-court-aztecs-maya-society">Aztecs and other pre-Hispanic civilizations</a> in the area (<em>SN: 3/13/20</em>).</p>



<p>Using other codices from the region, researchers had previously identified the combination of two pictographs that denotes an earthquake. One shows four helices around a central circle or eye, and stands for <em>ollin</em>, meaning “movement” in Nahuatl. The other pictograph shows one or more rectangular layers filled with dots, and means <em>tlalli</em>, or “earth.” For daytime earthquakes, the eye is open; for nighttime quakes, it’s closed.</p>

Suárez and V. García-Acosta/<em>Seismological Research Letters</em> 2021</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>Seismologist Gerardo Suárez of the National Autonomous University of Mexico and social anthropologist Virginia García-Acosta of the Center for Research and Higher Studies in Social Anthropology, both in Mexico City, pored over the <em>Telleriano-Remensis</em><em>. </em>The researchers were looking for representations of quakes, comparing what they found to accounts of quakes in other pre-Hispanic codices and texts written later by Spanish friars.</p>



<p>The <em>Telleriano-Remensis</em> uses a pictorial representation of a 52-year cycle to roughly date the quakes. Years are represented by four signs— <em>tecpatl</em> (knife), <em>calli</em> (house), <em>tochtli</em> (rabbit) and <em>acatl</em> (reed) — arranged in 13 permutations. Those images helped the researchers match some pictorial accounts of quakes, including one in 1507, to later descriptions of the events.</p>



<p>Little more is recounted about the precise locations of these quakes or the damage they caused, although one image suggests that a quake triggered flooding that drowned warriors. Other codices may contain more clues, the researchers say, which could help create a more complete chronology of the quakes that shook this ancient world.</p>

                <p><em>By </em><a href="http://emilyoliviareynolds.com/">Emily Reynolds</a></p>



<p>Research has found significant racial biases when judging the emotions of others. Black people are more likely to be misjudged as angry, for example, and <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2020/08/04/teacher-trainees-are-more-likely-to-misread-black-children-as-angry-than-white-children/">recent research</a> has suggested that even children are victims of this &#8220;anger bias&#8221;. Black children are also frequently subject to <a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/doiLanding?doi=10.1037%2Fa0035663">&#8220;adultification&#8221;</a> — being perceived as older and more mature than White peers.</p>



<p>A <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/02699931.2021.1950127?journalCode=pcem20">new study</a> explores the links between these two phenomena, finding that the older adults believe Black children to be, the more likely they are to (incorrectly) judge them to be angry too. Writing in <em>Cognition and Emotion</em>, Alison N. Cooke and Amy G. Halberstadt from North Carolina State University argue that such judgements could have serious consequences for Black children.</p>



<span id="more-43464"></span>



<p>Participants, 152 parents from the US, viewed forty expressions on the faces of children, representing happiness, sadness, disgust, surprise, or fear, and had to indicate which emotion they saw (none of children made an angry expression, but participants were able to indicate that the emotion was one of anger). Participants were also shown still images of each of the forty children displaying a neutral expression and asked to indicate the age of the child.</p>



<p>While the race of the children did not make a significant difference to their perceived age, participants were more likely to incorrectly judge Black children to be angry, replicating previous research. And the interaction between the race of the child and their perceived age was also a predictor of anger bias — that is, the older participants believed a Black child to be, the more likely they were to mischaracterise them as angry. For White children, however, there was no such increase in mischaracterisation.</p>



<p>So although participants didn’t perceive the Black children to be any older as a group than the White children, they did perceive them as being angrier, particularly when they believed that a Black child as an <em>individual</em> was older. This may result in more serious consequences for older-seeming Black children than for their White counterparts. A best case scenario, the team argues, would be “confusion that individuals could attempt to clarify or ignore”. Other outcomes, however, could be incredibly serious: targeting by the police, suspension from school, or the perceiver getting angry or violent towards the child.</p>



<p>Future research could explore the perceptions of different demographics: how do police, teachers, or social workers perceive Black and White children, and what impact does it have on the way such children are treated? And how is perceived anger linked to other biases, like the <a href="https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/10.1086/693955">weak bonds</a> teachers feel towards students of colour, for example? “Our findings are important for anyone interacting with children, and particularly those in education and law enforcement,” Cooke <a href="https://news.ncsu.edu/2021/08/anger-bias-adultification/">says</a>. “It really drives home that there is widespread bias in how Black children are viewed and that this can have significant consequences for their well-being.”</p>



<p>Looking at the psychological elements of systemic racism alone, without considering wider societal factors, is unlikely to cause wholesale change. Identifying and acknowledging them, however, is crucial to our understanding of the experiences young Black people have in the UK, US and beyond.</p>



<p>&#8211; <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/02699931.2021.1950127?journalCode=pcem20">Adultification, anger bias, and adults’ different perceptions of Black and White children</a></p>

<h4>Corny fuel</h4>



<p><em>Genetically modified baker’s yeast can turn corn stover — cornstalks, leaves and other harvest debris that farmers often leave to rot in fields — into ethanol, <strong>Nikk Ogasa</strong> reported in “<a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/genetically-modified-yeast-ethanol-cornstalk-biofuel">Yeast turns corn leftovers into fuel</a>” (</em>SN: 7/31/21, p. 12<em>). </em></p>



<p>Reader <strong>Doug Brown</strong> wanted to know how removing the corn leftovers would affect soil systems, considering that the materials contribute to soil structure, health and maintenance.</p>



<p>Leaving corn stover behind to promote healthy soils is important, <strong>Ogasa</strong> says. “The vision isn’t to strip the fields bare, but to extract a minor portion — around 20 to 25 percent — of the corn stover for ethanol production.”</p>





<p>Reader <strong>Diana Lutz</strong> wondered if ethanol production would help curb the climate crisis, considering that burning the fuel produces carbon dioxide.</p>



<p>While burning ethanol does release CO<sub>2</sub>, growing corn can capture the greenhouse gas, <strong>Ogasa</strong> says. This cycling of carbon is different from burning fossil fuels, which only adds more CO<sub>2</sub> to the atmosphere. Long-term climate solutions certainly need to include alternatives to burning fuels, says metabolic engineer <strong>Felix Lam</strong> of MIT. Substituting some fossil fuel use with ethanol or other biofuels could help reduce CO<sub>2</sub> emissions now while scientists develop emission-free energy sources, <strong>Lam</strong> says.</p>



<h4>Cosmic mysteries</h4>



<p><em>The last century of astronomy has revealed the complexity of the cosmos, including the existence of exoplanets and colliding galaxies, <strong>Lisa Grossman</strong> reported in “<a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/space-exoplanet-century-astronomy-earth-universe">A century of new worlds</a>” (</em>SN: 7/31/21, p. 18<em>).</em></p>



<p>Reader <strong>Raleigh Truitt</strong> asked whether the presence of colliding galaxies means there are exceptions to the idea that galaxies are moving away from each other.</p>



<p>It’s a question of scale, <strong>Grossman</strong> says. “On large enough scales, yes, the universe is expanding at an accelerating rate, and galaxies are flying away from each other. But that doesn’t mean they can never meet,” she says. “Gravity is still very good at bringing matter together, and galaxies run into each other all the time.”</p>



<p><strong>Grossman</strong> reported that Mars’ sky, initially thought to be blue, is actually pinkish-yellow thanks to dust particles in the air. Given that Earth’s oceans are blue like its sky, reader <strong>Emily Rader</strong> wondered what color Mars’ surface water would have been long ago.</p>



<p>Martian oceans would probably have appeared blue, says planetary scientist<strong> Germán Martínez </strong>of the Lunar and Planetary Institute in Houston. Mars’ atmospheric composition, which helps determine the color of its sky, does not affect most of the sunlight that reaches the planet’s surface, <strong>Martínez</strong> says. Sunlight at the surface contains all colors in the visible light spectrum. Water molecules absorb red, orange, green and yellow wavelengths from sunlight and scatter blue wavelengths. That is why we perceive Earth’s oceans as blue, he says. So just as on Earth, water on ancient Mars would have looked blue.</p>



<h4>Correction</h4>



<p>“<a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/psychology-behavior-human-mind-cognition-mental-health">Mind games</a>” (<em>SN: 8/14/21, p. 18</em>) failed to note that psychologist S­tephen Reicher of the University of St. Andrews in Scotland collaborated with psychologist S. Alexander Haslam of the University of Queensland in Australia to conduct a prison experiment in which guards developed their own rules. The experiment took place in 2001, not 2002.</p>

<h4>Wondrous wings</h4>



<p>Spindly scales and a waxy coating are the secret to glasswing butterflies’ transparent wings (shown below), <strong>Maria Temming</strong> reported in “<a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/new-images-how-glasswing-butterflies-wings-transparent">What’s behind this butterfly’s see-through wings</a>” (<em>SN: 7/31/21, p. 32</em>). Reader <strong>Connie Jagodzinski</strong> found the research fascinating: “It made me think of <em>Star Trek</em>’s cloaking devices and how this … amazing little insect could galvanize big old human technology.”</p>

                <p>Given the state of the world, it seems apt to wonder how to find purpose and joy in dark times. How can one live a good life when it feels as if things just keep getting worse?</p>



<p>It’s a question that many people have asked themselves in the last 18 months. Good news for us: A small group of scientists has put a great deal of thought into trying to answer that question. In this issue, social sciences writer Sujata Gupta explores <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/good-life-happy-meaning-richness-change-experiences-psychology">how people can find fulfillment, even in disastrous times</a>.</p>



<p>Gupta argues that the pandemic is a prime example of a perspective-changing moment. Last December, as she was researching pandemic fatigue, she stumbled across a related line of work suggesting that novel or aesthetic experiences can help people lead rich lives. Gupta, who used to travel extensively, was intrigued. But before she could learn more, she, her husband and their young daughter got COVID-19. They recovered, but the episode left the family reeling. “I thought, ‘Wow, I need to make some changes,’ ” Gupta told me. “I need to pay heed and listen to what this [crisis] is saying.”</p>



<p>As she dug deeper into writings on how to live a good life, she saw herself reflected in the nascent rich life research. That feeling grew stronger as she spoke with philosopher Lorraine Besser of Vermont’s Middlebury College and social psychologist Erin Westgate of the University of Florida in Gainesville. They both told her that richness could be cultivated, even without wild adventures. “I thought, ‘Oh my god, it’s me.’ I had never connected with research quite like that.”</p>



<p>New, creative experiences can feel hard to come by while isolated in a pandemic, but Gupta found a way: Learn to make pottery. “It’s a creative outlet, and I put zero stress on it,” she said. “You don’t have to be good.” The act of creating those lovely, often wobbly, pots has restored some of the richness she used to feel while exploring the world.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/brain-human-organoids-personalized-cluster-cells-study-disorders">How personalized brain organoids could help us demystify disorders</a></h4>

              
                <p>Clumps of brain cells grown from the stem cells of two people with a neurological syndrome show signs of the disorder. The results, published August 23 in <em>Nature Neuroscience</em>, suggest that <a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41593-021-00906-5">personalized brain organoids</a> could be powerful tools to understand complex disorders.</p>



<p>Researchers are eager to create brain organoids, human stem cells coaxed into becoming 3-D blobs of brain cells, because of their ability to <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/how-build-human-brain">mimic human brains</a> in the lab (<em>SN: 2/20/18</em>). In the current study, researchers grew two kinds of brain organoids. One kind, grown from healthy people’s stem cells, produced complex electrical activity that echoed the brain waves a full-sized brain makes. <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/brain-waves-may-focus-attention-and-keep-information-flowing">These waves</a>, created by the coordinated firing of many nerve cells, are part of how the brain keeps information moving (<em>SN: 3/13/18</em>).</p>



<p>The researchers also grew organoids using cells from a 25-year-old woman and a 5-year-old girl with Rett syndrome, a developmental disorder marked by seizures, autism and developmental lags. Rett syndrome is thought to be caused by changes in a gene called <em>MECP2</em>, mutations that the lab-grown organoids carried as well.</p>



<p>These organoids looked like those grown from healthy people, but behaved differently in some ways. Their nerve cells fired off signals that were too synchronized and less varied. Some of the brain waves these organoids produced are reminiscent of a brain having a seizure, in which a bolus of electrical activity scrambles normal brain business.</p>



<p>With organoids carrying Rett syndrome mutations, scientists can better understand the syndrome and even begin to test possible treatments. Organoids might yield insights into other disorders, too, says coauthor Bennett Novitch, a developmental neuroscientist at the David Geffen School of Medicine at UCLA. “Work on this front is already under way in labs around the world.”</p>

                <p><em>By </em><a href="https://twitter.com/E_Barratt">Emma L. Barratt</a></p>



<p>It’s no secret that marginalised groups face barriers in educational settings that the able-bodied, male, and racially privileged largely do not. Issues pertaining to access, <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2020/08/06/how-stem-fields-can-foster-a-sense-of-belonging-for-minority-and-first-gen-students/">sense of belonging</a>, potential discrimination, and financial difficulties can add often insurmountable layers of complexity to applying for further education.</p>



<p>Efforts to address this in recent years have crystallised into a number of measures, including the wide adoption of diversity and inclusion grants. These provide financial support specifically for selected individuals from marginalised groups, in order to give them a more equal footing with applicants from privileged backgrounds.</p>



<p>However, <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0956797621993109">recent research</a> from Adriana L. Germano and colleagues at The University of Washington has illustrated some unintended flaws with this approach. In stark contrast with the ethos behind diversity and inclusion initiatives, these grants may be serving to make applications to prestigious scholarships even less diverse than before.</p>



<span id="more-43469"></span>



<p>The paper, published in <em>Psychological Science</em>, builds this argument from four separate studies. In the first, participants (N=168) from racial groups underrepresented in US colleges were asked to choose between two hypothetical grants they could apply for: one of $5000, or one of $2500. In one condition, participants read that the smaller amount was available to anyone, and in the other, they learned that it was a diversity award, specifically for underrepresented ethnic or racial minorities. The reasoning behind the participants’ grant selection was then probed by questions that assessed factors such as how likely they felt they would be to get the grant, or how much they felt the scholarship was for people like them.</p>



<p>The team found that when neither grant was labelled as a diversity award, 87% of applicants would shoot for the $5000 award. However, when the smaller grant was labelled as a diversity award, this number dropped sharply, with only 55.3% participants choosing to apply for the larger, unrestricted grant. Analysis of the responses revealed that this was in large part because participants felt that they fit better into the intended group of the diversity award. Not only that, but the large majority were more confident they’d receive this award than the more valuable, unrestricted award.</p>



<p>The researchers then investigated whether these findings were generalisable to other minority groups. This time, they looked at women applicants’ choice of grant. The method was identical to that of study one, except that the diversity award’s description now specified it was for women applicants only. New follow-up questions probed participants’ feelings of how biased those awarding the grants may be, and what they may write in an application essay.</p>



<p>Again, participants tended to choose the larger award when neither was billed as a diversity award (73%). But, when the smaller grant was labelled as a diversity award for women applicants, it once again attracted the majority of applications (61.9%). And, as in the first study, this group appeared to be going for the diversity award because they felt that they fit better within the intended pool of applicants, rather than for any other reason (such as beliefs about the fairness of the evaluators).</p>



<p>In the final study, the team took a closer look at the real-world behavioural consequences of these findings. Female participants (N=152) were given the opportunity to write 500-word essays for the chance to win either one or two grants, valued at $30 and $20. In one condition, these were both unrestricted, and in another, the smaller grant was labelled as a diversity grant. Participants were asked which of the essays they would like to work on first, and after completing the first essay, were given the option to continue, or to leave the study having applied for just their first choice.</p>



<p>Perhaps unsurprisingly, given the effort of essay writing, 31% of participants chose to leave after applying for just one of the grants. When both grants were unrestricted, 87.7% prioritised the larger grant. However, in line with the previous findings, only 50% of participants prioritised the larger award when a diversity award was also presented. Of those that chose to complete both application essays, 90.9% prioritised the larger amount when no diversity option was offered, versus a miniscule 39.1% when one was present.</p>



<p>These findings suggest a stark dilemma. In providing explicit diversity opportunities, organisations may inadvertently be siphoning diverse talent away from more lucrative awards and opportunities. This could leave those from privileged backgrounds more likely to receive larger significant grants, which may even have an exponential effect, as additional benefits are often more readily afforded to those in receipt of prestigious awards.</p>



<p>Furthermore, though this study didn’t explicitly test this phenomenon within a disabled population, the final study hints at the potential problems this effect may pose for this group. The physical effort of applying for awards, compounded by this prioritisation of lower value diversity awards, may place such candidates in an especially inequitable position. This may be a fruitful and informative avenue for further research, and could lead to the development of more robust equity measures.</p>



<p>This study highlights the need for thorough consideration and assessment of the application of diversity initiatives. There are clearly other factors to consider too; for example, it may be the case that diversity grants encourage a larger number of diverse candidates to apply for awards in the first place. However, these findings strongly underline the necessity for proper analysis and monitoring of grant applications to ensure the intended effect is achieved.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/vortex-beam-atom-molecule-quantum-physics">New ‘vortex beams’ of atoms and molecules are the first of their kind</a></h4>

              
                <p>Like soft serve ice cream, beams of atoms and molecules now come with a swirl.</p>



<p>Scientists already knew how to dish up spiraling beams of light or electrons, known as <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/twisted-way-take-pictures">vortex beams</a> (<em>SN: 1/14/11</em>). Now, <a href="http://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.abj2451">the first vortex beams of atoms and molecules</a> are on the menu, researchers report in the Sept. 3 <em>Science</em>.</p>



<p>Vortex beams made of light or electrons have shown promise for making special types of microscope images and for <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/quantum-communication-takes-new-twist">transmitting information</a> using quantum physics (<em>SN: 8/5/15</em>). But vortex beams of larger particles such as atoms or molecules are so new that the possible applications aren’t yet clear, says physicist Sonja Franke-Arnold of the University of Glasgow in Scotland, who was not involved with the research. “It’s maybe too early to really know what we can do with it.”</p>



<p>In quantum physics, particles are <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/wave-function-directly-measured">described by a wave function</a>, a wavelike pattern that allows scientists to calculate the probability of finding a particle in a particular place (<em>SN: 6/8/11</em>). But vortex beams’ waves don’t slosh up and down like ripples on water. Instead, the beams’ particles have wave functions that move in a corkscrewing motion as a beam travels through space. That means the beam carries a rotational oomph known as orbital angular momentum. “This is something really very strange, very nonintuitive,” says physicist Edvardas Narevicius of the Weizmann Institute of Science in Rehovot, Israel.</p>





<p>Narevicius and colleagues created the new beams by passing helium atoms through a grid of specially shaped slit patterns, each just 600 nanometers wide. The team detected a hallmark of vortex beams: a row of doughnut-shaped rings imprinted on a detector by the atoms, in which each doughnut corresponds to a beam with a different orbital angular momentum.</p>



<p>Another set of doughnuts revealed the presence of vortex beams of helium excimers, molecules created when a helium atom in an excited, or energized, state pairs up with another helium atom.</p>

<p>Next, scientists might investigate what happens when vortex beams of molecules or atoms collide with light, electrons or other atoms or molecules. Such collisions are well-understood for normal particle beams, but not for those with orbital angular momentum. Similar vortex beams made with protons might also serve as a method for probing the subatomic particle’s <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/theres-still-lot-we-dont-know-about-proton">mysterious innards</a> (<em>SN: 4/18/17</em>).</p>



<p>In physics, “most important things are achieved when we are revisiting known phenomena with a fresh perspective,” says physicist Ivan Madan of EPFL, the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Lausanne, who was not involved with the research. “And, for sure, this experiment allows us to do that.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/astronomy-star-swallow-black-hole-supernova-cosmology">Astronomers may have seen a star gulp down a black hole and explode</a></h4>

              
                <p>For the first time, astronomers have captured solid evidence of a rare double cosmic cannibalism — a star swallowing a compact object such as a black hole or neutron star. In turn, that object gobbled the star’s core, causing it to explode and leave behind only a black hole.</p>



<p>The first hints of the gruesome event, described in the Sept. 3 <em>Science</em>, <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.abg6037">came from the Very Large Array</a> (VLA), a radio telescope consisting of 27 enormous dishes in the New Mexican desert near Socorro. During the observatory’s scans of the night sky in 2017, a burst of radio energy as bright as the brightest exploding star — or supernova — as seen from Earth appeared in a dwarf star–forming galaxy approximately 500 million light-years away.</p>



<p>“We thought, ‘Whoa, this is interesting,’” says Dillon Dong, an astronomer at Caltech.</p>



<p>He and his colleagues made follow-up observations of the galaxy using the VLA and one of the telescopes at the W.M. Keck Observatory in Hawaii, which sees in the same optical light as our eyes. The Keck telescope caught a luminous outflow of material spewing in all directions at 3.2 million kilometers per hour from a central location, suggesting that an energetic explosion had occurred there in the past.</p>





<p>The team then found an extremely bright X-ray source in archival data from the Monitor of All Sky X-ray Image (MAXI) telescope, a Japanese instrument that sits on the International Space Station. This X-ray burst was in the same place as the radio one but had been observed back in 2014. &nbsp;</p>



<p>Piecing the data together, Dong and his colleagues think this is what happened: Long ago, a binary pair of stars were born orbiting each other; one died in a spectacular supernova and became either a neutron star or a black hole. As gravity brought the two objects closer together, the dead star actually entered the outer layers of its larger stellar sibling.</p>



<p>The compact object spiraled inside the still-living star for hundreds of years, eventually making its way down to and then eating its partner’s core. During this time, the larger star shed huge amounts of gas and dust, forming a shell of material around the duo.</p>



<p>In the living star’s center, gravitational forces and complex magnetic interactions from the dead star’s munching launched enormous jets of energy — picked up as an X-ray flash in 2014 — as well as causing the larger star to explode. Debris from the detonation smashed with colossal speed into the surrounding shell of material, generating the optical and radio light.</p>



<p>While theorists have previously envisioned such a scenario, dubbed a merger-triggered core collapse supernova, this appears to represent the first direct observation of this phenomenon, Dong says.</p>



<p>“They’ve done some pretty good detective work using these observations,” says Adam Burrows, an astrophysicist at Princeton University who was not involved in the new study. He says the findings should help constrain the timing of <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00159-013-0059-2">a process called common envelope evolution</a>, in which one star becomes immersed inside another. Such stages in stars’ lives are relatively short-lived in cosmic time and difficult to both observe and simulate. Most of the time, the engulfing partner dies before its core is consumed, leading to two compact objects like white dwarfs, neutron stars or black holes orbiting one another.</p>



<p>The final stages of these systems are exactly what observatories like the Advanced Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory, or LIGO, detect when <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/gravitational-wave-ligo-virgo-new-signals-ripples-spacetime">capturing spacetime’s ripples</a>, Dong says (<em>SN: 8/4/21</em>). Now that astronomers know to look for these multiple lines of evidence, he expects them to find more examples this strange phenomenon.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/wasp-nests-glow-green-ultraviolet-light-fluorescence">Some wasps’ nests glow green under ultraviolet light</a></h4>

              
                <p>Beam a black light into some Vietnamese forests at night, and brilliant green bulbs may glow in the trees. These eerie lanterns are the nests of several species of Asian paper wasps, and the gleam comes from <a href="https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rsif.2021.0418">silk fibers in the nests</a> that fluoresce when struck by ultraviolet light, researchers report in the August <em>Journal of the Royal Society Interface</em>.</p>



<p>“When you see it, it&#8217;s just magic,” says chemist Bernd Schöllhorn of the Molecular Electrochemistry Lab at the University of Paris and CNRS.</p>



<p>Schöllhorn and colleagues discovered the nests while searching forests in Vietnam for fluorescent insects using powerful UV torches. “It looked like somebody turned on a flashlight in the forest, but nobody was there,” he says.</p>

<p>Fluorescence occurs throughout the animal kingdom. <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/platypus-glow-blue-green-ultraviolet-light-fluorescent-fur">Platypuses</a>, scorpions and <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/first-fluorescent-frogs-might-see-each-others-glow">polka dot tree frogs</a>, for example, all fluoresce under UV light (<em>SN: 11/6/20; SN: 4/3/17</em>). After analyzing the fluorescence of the nests of some Asian paper wasps (<em>Polistes </em>spp.) in the lab, the researchers found that silk threads in the nests glow more brilliantly than other documented fluorescent biomaterials.</p>



<p>The nests of one wasp species, <em>P. brunetus</em>, emitted about one-third as much light as they absorbed. And in some cases, the nests were visible by the naked eye from up to 20 meters away. “We haven&#8217;t seen any other example like that,” Schöllhorn says. The fluorescence must benefit the wasps somehow, the researchers say, though it’s unclear how. One hypothesis is that the nests protect larvae inside from UV radiation by absorbing some of the harmful energy and <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/tardigrade-water-bear-glow-blue-ultraviolet-light">dissipating it as visible light</a>, Schöllhorn says (<em>SN: 10/13/20</em>). Or, as the sun directly casts its last UV light at the end of the day, the nests might shine bright enough amid the darkening foliage to help wayward wasps find home, like beacons at twilight.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2021/09/02/tackling-income-inequality-could-boost-childrens-vocabulary/">Tackling Income Inequality Could Boost Children’s Vocabulary</a></h4>

              
                <p><em>By </em><a href="http://emilyoliviareynolds.com/">Emily Reynolds</a></p>



<p>In 1995, a seminal book was <a href="https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=I2pHAAAAMAAJ&amp;redir_esc=y">published</a> suggesting that children from lower socioeconomic backgrounds were exposed to 30 million fewer words than richer children by the age of 4 — the so-called &#8220;word gap&#8221;. The idea is now widespread and has informed early childhood policy in the United States (though the findings are more <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/education/archive/2018/06/the-long-contentious-history-of-the-word-gap-study/562850/">contentious</a> than this ubiquity might suggest).</p>



<p>But why might these kids be exposed to fewer words? A <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/epdf/10.1111/desc.13151?saml_referrer">new study</a> from a team at the University of California, Berkeley, finds that worries about financial insecurity reduced the amount that caregivers spoke to their small children, suggesting that these concerns themselves could be at least partly responsible for the word gap.</p>



<span id="more-43457"></span>



<p>Participants were 84 caregivers and their three year old children. First, a caregiver and their child were seated across from each other at a table, and while the child completed an unrelated experiment with a researcher, caregivers were placed into one of two conditions.</p>



<p>In the scarcity condition, caregivers were asked to reflect on three or four times in the past week when they didn’t have enough of something or when resources were scarce, writing a brief reflection about two of those experiences. In the control condition, caregivers wrote about two things they had done in the last week.</p>



<p>When the caregiver had completed the survey, they were left alone with their child and a shape sorting puzzle which allowed, but didn’t obligate, them to engage in speech. A video camera recorded their interactions, with researchers using transcripts to analyse the quantity and quality of language used by caregivers.</p>



<p>Results showed that those in the scarcity condition used fewer words than those in the control condition as well as fewer word <em>types</em> (e.g. nouns, adjectives, and other categories), though this latter difference was not statistically significant. Interestingly, caregivers who reflected specifically on <em>financial</em> insecurity spoke to their children significantly less than those who focused on other forms of scarcity (such as time).</p>



<p>A second study looked at more natural, daily environments, using publicly available audio recordings of children and their caregivers taken over multiple days. The team looked specifically at changes in conversation towards the end of the month, which previous research has identified as a period when people of all income groups are less financially secure.</p>



<p>Across all of the recordings, back and forth interactions between caregivers and children were reduced during the last week of the month. Children themselves were also on average less likely to use language during this week compared to the rest of the month, though adult speech overall was not reduced during this period. The results also held for caregivers from all financial brackets.</p>



<p>Though the end of the month may, on the whole, be a time of relative financial stress, the study was not able to isolate this as the key factor in reduced speech; further research could look more closely at times of difference in vocalisation between caregivers and children, using specific measures of financial stress to understand the link.</p>



<p>The findings could go some way to explain <em>why</em> parents who are struggling financially might talk less to their children. The team suggests that parents have less time and attention to speak to their children when stressed or anxious. “If you are worried about putting food on the table, or scraping together money for that medical bill, or figuring out where to enroll your child in school now you have been evicted, you may be less likely to narrate the colour of the sky to your child as you ride on the bus,” they write.</p>



<p>As noted, however, there are also issues with the concept of the word gap altogether: <a href="https://srcd.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/cdev.13072">recent longitudinal research</a> failed to replicate the findings of the 1995 study, suggesting it may not be as cut and dry as assumed. But limitations aside, there is certainly one serious takeaway from the study: the importance of considering external, material factors on childcare and parenting. While individual interventions may solicit some positive results, looking at wider social and political factors could be a better way of addressing childhood inequalities than putting the onus on individuals.</p>



<p>&#8211; <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/epdf/10.1111/desc.13151?saml_referrer">What causes the word gap? Financial concerns may systematically suppress child-directed speech</a></p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/fire-amazon-rainforest-threatened-species-deforestation-biodiversity">Fires may have affected up to 85 percent of threatened Amazon species</a></h4>

              
                <p>Much of the Amazon’s biodiversity is under fire — literally.</p>



<p>In the last two decades, deforestation and forest <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-021-03876-7">fires have encroached on the ranges of thousands of plant and animal species</a> in the Amazon rainforest, including up to 85 percent of threatened species in the region, researchers report September 1 in <em>Nature</em>.</p>



<p>The extent of the damage is closely tied to the enforcement, or lack thereof, of regulations in Brazil aimed at protecting the forest from widespread logging as well as the fires often used to clear open space in the forest and other encroachments. The findings illustrate the key role that forest use regulations have in the fate of the Amazon rainforest, the researchers argue.</p>



<p>Threats to the survival of this biodiversity could have long-term effects. Biodiversity boosts a forest’s resilience to drought, says Arie Staal, an ecologist at Utrecht University in the Netherlands who was not involved with this research. A deep bench of tree species allows the plants to replace those that may not survive drought conditions, he says. “If fire-impacted area continues to rise, not only does the Amazon lose forest cover, but also some of its capacity to cope with the changing climate.”</p>





<p>And as fires advance deeper into the rainforest, more species will experience fire for the first time, Staal says. “These species, including many threatened ones, have not evolved under circumstances with regular fires, so the consequences for those species can be severe.” Such consequences may include increased risk of population declines or extinction, similar to the <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/australia-wildfires-extinction-threat-species-one-year-later">fears following the major outbreak of fires in Australia</a> in 2019 and 2020 (<em>SN: 3/9/21</em>).</p>



<p>In recent decades, ongoing <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/many-amazon-trees-endangered">deforestation</a> and periodic drought in the Amazon basin have been associated with intensifying fires there (<em>SN: 11/20/15</em>). In 2019, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/brazil-amazon-rainforest-fires-climate-emissions-oxygen">a particularly severe series of fires</a> scorched the region (<em>SN: 8/23/19</em>).&nbsp;</p>



<p>“But we do not know how fires are impacting the biodiversity across the Amazon basin,” says Xiao Feng, a biogeographer at Florida State University in Tallahassee.&nbsp;The Amazon “is a huge area, and it is generally impossible for people to go there and count the number of species before the fire and after the fire,” he says. “That’s an incredible amount of work.”</p>



<p>So Feng and a team of collaborators from Brazil, China, the Netherlands and the United States instead investigated how Amazonian plant and animal species’ geographic ranges have been exposed to recent fires. The team compiled range maps of 11,514 plant and 3,079 vertebrate species, creating what may be the most comprehensive dataset of range maps for the Amazon. The team compared these maps with satellite images of Amazon forest cover from 2001 to 2019. Those images let the team track how logging and fires have led to the degradation of rainforest habitat.</p>



<p>Fire impacted up to about 190,000 square kilometers — an area roughly the size of Washington state, the team found. Up to about 95 percent of the species featured in the study had ranges that overlapped with fires during this period, though for many species, burned areas made up less than 15 percent of their overall range.</p>



<p>Affected species include up to 85 percent of the 610 considered threatened — so vulnerable to extinction or already endangered or critically endangered — by the International Union for Conservation of Nature. This category includes as many as 264 kinds of plants, 107 amphibians and 55 mammals. In 2019 alone, over 12,000 species experienced fire somewhere in their geographic range.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Starting in 2009, when a series of regulations aimed at reducing deforestation started being enforced, the extent of fires generally decreased, except in drought years, the team found. Then in 2019, fires ticked back up again, coinciding with a relaxation of regulations. Much of the fire-driven forest loss was congregated along the more intensely logged southern reaches of the rainforest.</p>



<p>The shift suggests that effective forest preservation policies can slow this trend of destruction, and may be crucial for preventing the region from reaching a <a href="https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/full/10.1098/rstb.2007.0036?ct=">tipping point</a>. That point would occur when the cycle of deforestation, drying and fire triggers widespread transformation of the Amazon basin into a savanna-like habitat.</p>



<p>While this study couldn’t track the fate of specific plants or animals, Feng now plans to look at fire’s impact on certain groups of species that may have very different vulnerabilities to an increasingly flammable Amazon. “We know some trees may be more resistant to burns, but some may not. So it may also be really important to distinguish differences,” he says.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/arabia-stone-age-tools-humans-migration-green-lakes-desert">Stone Age humans or their relatives occasionally trekked through a green Arabia</a></h4>

              
                <p>Arabia, known today for its desert landscape, served as a “green turnstile” for migrating Stone Age members of the human genus starting around 400,000 years ago, a new study finds.</p>



<p>Monsoon rains periodically turned northern Arabia into a well-watered oasis, creating windows of opportunity for long-ago humans or their relatives to trek through that crossroads region from starting points in northern Africa and southwest Asia.</p>



<p>That’s the implication of a series of five ancient lake beds of varying ages, each accompanied by distinctive stone tools, unearthed at a northern Saudi Arabian site called Khall Amayshan 4, or KAM 4. Sediments from the lake beds, which were linked to periods when the climate was wetter than today, also yielded fossils of hippos, wild cattle and other animals. Like hominids, those creatures must have <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-021-03863-y">migrated into the region along rain-fed lakes</a>, wetlands and rivers, an international team reports online September 1 in <em>Nature</em>.</p>



<p>Until now, the oldest stone tools in Arabia <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/ancient-homo-stone-tools-north-africa-arabia-early">dated to at least 300,000 years ago</a> (<em>SN: 11/29/18</em>). Previous finds only hinted that Stone Age <em>Homo sapiens</em> or other <em>Homo</em> species temporarily inhabited green, wetter parts of Arabia, a conclusion largely resting on discoveries <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/fossils-hint-hominids-migrated-through-green-arabia-300000-years-ago">at two other Saudi sites, each preserving stone tools from a single point in time</a> (<em>SN: 11/1/18</em>).</p>



<p>Aside from providing the earliest known evidence of hominids in Arabia, the new finds demonstrate for the first time that ancient <em>Homo</em> groups traveled there when conditions turned wet, say archaeologist Huw Groucutt of the Max Planck Institute for the Science of Human History in Jena, Germany, and colleagues.</p>

<p>As a result, northern Arabia could have served as a key, if intermittent, passageway out of Africa for humans or close evolutionary relatives <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/sharp-stones-found-india-signal-surprisingly-early-toolmaking-advances">who reached South Asia by around 385,000 years ago</a> (<em>SN: 1/31/18</em>), <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/long-going-europe-humans-ventured-east-asia">southern China between 120,000 and 80,000 years ago</a> (<em>SN: 10/14/15</em>) and <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/blog/science-ticker/ancient-people-arrived-sumatra-rainforests-more-60000-years-ago">the Indonesian island of Sumatra between 73,000 and 63,000 years ago</a> (<em>SN: 8/9/17</em>).</p>



<p>The number, completeness and time frames of KAM 4’s ancient lake deposits make this site “one of a kind … that will continue to produce remarkable results,” says archaeologist Donald Henry of the University of Tulsa in Oklahoma, who did not participate in the new study.</p>





<p>Across five occupation phases covering hundreds of thousands of years, different <em>Homo</em> species or closely related populations at KAM 4 “were doing broadly the same things,” Groucutt says. Small groups camped by lakes where individuals made stone tools for food preparation, hunting and woodworking.</p>



<p>But each phase, dated mainly by a technique that estimated the amount of time since grains of lake sediment had last been exposed to sunlight, had its own evolutionary character.</p>



<p>For example, the identity of the KAM 4 crowd 400,000 years ago, who left behind large hand axes, is unclear, but the researchers know it couldn’t have been <em>H. sapiens</em>. <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/oldest-known-homo-sapiens-fossils-come-northern-africa-studies-claim">Our species didn’t originate until roughly 300,000 years ago in Africa</a> (<em>SN: 6/7/17</em>). One possibility is that those ancient Arabians represented a now-extinct <em>Homo</em> population from southwest Asia that later migrated into Africa, possibly contributing to <em>H. sapiens</em> evolution, Groucutt speculates.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" width="680" height="316" src="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/083121_bb_hominids-arabia_inline1.jpg" alt="a stone hand axe shown from four different angles" class="wp-image-3103165" srcset="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/083121_bb_hominids-arabia_inline1.jpg 680w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/083121_bb_hominids-arabia_inline1-330x153.jpg 330w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><figcaption><span class="caption wp-caption-3103165">Members of an unidentified <em>Homo</em> group left behind stone hand axes such this one (shown from different angles) along the shore of a northern Arabian lake about 400,000 years ago.</span><span class="credit wp-credit-3103165">Ian Cartwright/Palaeodeserts Project</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>Similar but slightly smaller, more finely worked hand axes turned up along the shore of a roughly 300,000-year-old KAM 4 lake bed, indicating a second phase of occupation. Groucutt and colleagues doubt that early <em>H. sapiens </em>from Africa scurried over to KAM 4 in time to make those tools. Whichever <em>Homo</em> group did could have come either from northern Africa or southwest Asia, the researchers say.</p>



<p>A third round of KAM 4 occupants, probably <em>H. sapiens</em>, fashioned artifacts excavated at an approximately 200,000-year-old lake bed, Groucutt says. These finds consist of rock chunks shaped so that sharp flakes, also unearthed there, could be pounded off. Humans based in northeastern Africa around that time made similar tools. Some of those people may have reached Arabia before eventually journeying to southwest Asia, Groucutt suggests.</p>



<p>Groucutt’s group excavated comparable tools at a site called Jubbah about 150 kilometers east of KAM 4 that date to around 210,000 years ago. Those finds are another sign of human migrations into Arabia at a time when the corresponding KAM 4 lake bed shows that wet conditions reigned. Additional stone tools unearthed at Jubbah date to around 75,000 years ago.</p>



<p>Stone implements resembling the Jubbah finds were also excavated at the youngest two KAM 4 sites, one dating to between about 125,000 and 75,000 years ago and the other to roughly 55,000 years ago. The older site likely hosted <em>H. sapiens</em>, possibly a group that left Africa, Groucutt suggests.</p>



<p>The youngest KAM 4 artifacts could represent either <em>H. sapiens</em> or Neandertals, he says. Neandertals reached the Middle East by about 70,000 years ago and could have reached a green Arabia by 55,000 years ago. If so, Neandertals may have interbred with <em>H. sapiens</em> in Arabia, a possibility not raised before.</p>



<p>Despite uncertainties about which hominids reached KAM 4 during its green phases, KAM 4 tools generally look more like similarly aged African tools than artifacts previously found in southern Arabia or at eastern Mediterranean sites, says Henry, the University of Tulsa archaeologist. Migrations out of Africa, he says, now appear more likely to have wended through northern Arabia rather than across a narrow Red Sea crossing to southern Arabia, often regarded as a major dispersal route for ancient humans.</p>

                <img width="140" height="110" src="https://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2021/09/Melissa-Willoughby_blog-featured-image-140x110.jpg" class="attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image" alt="" style="display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear:both;" /><p><em>Welcome to our <strong>SDG Editorial Board Members</strong> blog collection. We are hearing from the Editorial Board Members of the BMC Series journals whose work aligns with achieving the Sustainable Development Goals. Here you can find other posts in this collection, grouped with the tag ‘SDG editorial board members‘.</em></p>
<hr />
<p>Violence is a complex issue that remains a public health priority globally. Violence is not equally distributed across society but disproportionately impacts people who face health and social inequities. People who experience health and social inequities, such as homelessness, unemployment, mental illness and substance use disorders, are also more likely to have contact with the criminal justice system.</p>
<p>My PhD research examines how we can prevent deaths and injuries from violence among adults and young people who have had contact with the criminal justice system in Australia. My work primarily relates to SDG 5, achieving gender equality and empowerment for all women and girls and SDG 16, promoting peaceful and inclusive societies. Preventing violence and deaths from violence is specified in three targets to achieve these goals. Target 5.2 aims to eliminate all forms of violence against women and girls, target 16.1 aims to reduce deaths from violence and target 16.2 aims to end all forms of violence against children.</p>
<p>A key challenge for this research is that the violence experienced by people who have had contact with the criminal justice system is rarely recognized as a health issue. This is despite violence being declared a priority for public health by the <a href="https://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/handle/10665/42495/9241545615_eng.pdf">World Health Organization</a> almost two decades ago, and <a href="https://www.euro.who.int/__data/assets/pdf_file/0007/98971/E94242.pdf">health of those who had had contact with the criminal justice system</a> being recognized as an important part of public health.</p>
<p>If we are to uphold the United Nations pledge of <em>‘<a href="https://sdgs.un.org/2030agenda">leaving no one behind’</a></em>, then we must consider the violence experienced by this population as a serious health issue in need of targeted, evidence-informed prevention efforts. <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/0886260520905546">My research</a> has established that people who have contact with the criminal justice system have a risk of dying from violence that is far greater than the risk experienced by the general population in Australia.</p>
<p>Ignoring the violence experienced by this population ignores the connection between health, violence and criminal justice system involvement. Many adults and young people who have experienced incarceration were victims of violence <em>before</em> they had contact with the criminal justice system. The <a href="https://www.anrows.org.au/publication/womens-imprisonment-and-domestic-family-and-sexual-violence/">vast majority (70-90%) of women</a> in prison have been victims of violence, most frequently intimate partner and family violence. For many of these people their violence victimization was connected to the reasons for their criminal justice system involvement. For example, people may turn to substance use as a coping strategy after being a victim of violence and are then subsequently charged with using or possessing substances. Young people may leave their home and become homeless after experiencing family violence, which in turn may increase the likelihood that they have contact with the criminal justice system.</p>
<p>We need to challenge and address the stigma that people who have had contact with the criminal justice experience, which continues long after their contact with the system. People who have had contact with the criminal justice system are part of the community and do not exist separately from it. Even those who are incarcerated usually only spend a relatively short period of time in prison before being released back into the community. As such, improving the health of this population and reducing the violence they experience is likely important to reducing health inequities at the population level and achieving SDGs 5 and 16.</p>
<p>People who have had contact with the criminal justice system need to be recognized as a priority group for violence prevention. Additionally, the health and social inequities that are drivers of death and injuries of violence, as well as criminal justice system involvement need to be addressed.</p>
<p>The impact of experiencing violence on health and behavior must be considered when people have contact with the criminal justice system. Our criminal justice systems need to be <a href="http://www.nasmhpd.org/sites/default/files/Women%20in%20Corrections%20TIC%20SR(2).pdf">trauma-informed and include trauma-informed responses</a>, which includes diversion to more appropriate services, such as mental health and family violence services. Without which, we may be further entrenching a cycle of disadvantage and violence in this population.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/good-life-happy-meaning-richness-change-experiences-psychology">Perspective-changing experiences, good or bad, can lead to richer lives</a></h4>

              
                <p class="has-drop-cap" style="font-size:20px">In December, my husband, our 5-year-old daughter and I tested positive for COVID-19. Life, already off-kilter, lurched. Smell, taste, breath — were they normal? The air smelled only of cold; everything tasted vaguely of cardboard.</p>



<p>The state mailed us a pulse oximeter to read oxygen levels from our fingers. The device beeped when those levels dipped too low — a seemingly objective measure during a subjective time. We used the device with abandon, only my husband regularly triggering the alarm. He went to bed, where he stayed for days, or maybe it was weeks. Time distilled into moments: remote school, meals, Christmas, pulse-ox, beep.</p>



<p>We exited quarantine on January 1, the day of fresh starts. Except my once energetic 8-year-old son, who somehow never tested positive, now loafed in front of the heater for hours. My husband, his breathing still abnormal and his fatigue lingering, raged. Ever the extrovert, I absorbed their emotions as my own. My risk calculation shifted, as despair overshadowed the fear of disease. The sickness we had hid from for so long had found us anyway. Were we now immune? Should we proceed just as before?</p>



<p>Prior to the sickness, I’d been researching <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/social-distancing-boredom-covid-19-public-health-pandemic">pandemic fatigue</a>, a term used to describe the boredom that can arise during a protracted crisis like the one we’re in now (<em>SN Online: 2/15/21</em>). “People prefer action to inaction,” social psychologist Erin Westgate of the University of Florida in Gainesville told me. For some, that compulsion toward the experiential runs deep, she and colleagues reported in 2014 in <em>Science</em>. When the researchers gave college students a choice between sitting idly in a quiet room or <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4330241/">pushing a button to receive an electric shock</a>, a startling number went for the shock.</p>



<p>I have been seeking, and pushing, that button all my life. I’ve taught English in Japan, worked as a national park ranger and, following an unfortunate series of events, sold pineapples along a tourist highway in Hawaii in exchange for a tent over my head. Westgate’s recent work suggests that button pushing sorts often flourish in rich and aesthetic environs. I took heed. Against the dreary backdrop of being homebound in a global health crisis, I signed up for private pottery lessons, drawn viscerally to the idea of creating something from mud.</p>

<h4>A third path</h4>



<p>Psychologists who study well-being or human flourishing have long posited that the “good life” can be pursued via two paths: happiness or meaning.</p>





<p>“So far, psychologists worked with this dichotomy — a dichotomous model of well-being about life,” says psychologist Shigehiro Oishi. He describes the happy life as one of joy, comfort and security, and the meaningful life as one of significance, purpose and coherence, or order. Happiness and meaning can run parallel or intersect, Oishi says. Both concepts are largely rooted in personal and societal stability.</p>



<p>What happens, though, when the ground beneath one’s feet buckles? Or what if one was never quite stable to begin with? What hope is there for finding a path to the good life?</p>



<p>For the last six years, Oishi and his team at the University of Virginia in Charlottesville have been hammering out their response: a third path to the good life coined “psychological richness.” Their research suggests that the ingredients of a rich life come not from stability in life circumstances or in temperament. Rather, the path to a rich life arises from novelty seeking, curiosity and moments that shift one’s view of the world. Rich experiences are neither inherently good nor bad; they may be intentional or accidental, joyous or traumatic.</p>



<p>The pandemic, in this light, embodies a novel, perspective-changing, psychologically rich moment. It has shattered our routines and livelihoods, robbed us of our loved ones and plunged many into despondency. But it has also steered some of us to the mud. We have captured wild yeast for sourdough breads, planted gardens and knitted sweaters; we have stared at a wet mound of clay on a wheel and wondered, what next?</p>



<p>This third good life path can provide a balm in difficult times, says Westgate, Oishi’s former graduate student. “Psychological richness opens up an avenue to the good life for people for whom circumstances may seem to have cut off paths to happiness and meaning.”</p>



<h4>Aristotle’s legacy </h4>



<p>If you want to understand psychological richness, read about Oliver Sacks, advises Lorraine Besser, a philosopher at Middlebury College in Vermont and Oishi’s collaborator. She is thinking of <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2015/02/19/opinion/oliver-sacks-on-learning-he-has-terminal-cancer.html">an adieu to the world</a> that Sacks wrote in the <em>New York Times</em> in February 2015, shortly after learning he was dying of cancer.</p>



<p>The renowned author and neurologist drew his inspiration from philosopher David Hume, who had written a similar adieu in 1776. Hume described himself as possessing a “mild disposition,” Sacks wrote. “Here I depart from Hume. While I have enjoyed loving relationships and friendships and have no real enmities, I cannot say (nor would anyone who knows me say) that I am a man of mild dispositions. On the contrary, I am a man of vehement disposition, with violent enthusiasms, and extreme immoderation in all my passions.”</p>



<p>Ancient discussions of the good life do not appear to consider Sacks’ model. Instead, fourth century B.C. Greek philosopher Aristotle looms large in this esoteric space. He opens his treatise, Nicomachean Ethics, by <a href="http://classics.mit.edu/Aristotle/nicomachaen.html">reviewing the various contenders for the good life</a> — pleasure, honor, wealth, health or eminence — eventually arriving at “eudaimonia,” essentially human flourishing. The eudaimonic person, Aristotle wrote, “is active in accordance with complete virtue … not for some unspecified period but throughout a complete life.”</p>





<p>Of those contenders, only pleasure and eudaimonia, the “feeling good and being good” sides of that dichotomous coin, have withstood the long test of time, Westgate says.</p>



<p>Aristotle, an unequivocal be-gooder, considered the good life an objective ideal. So does Susan Wolf. “Some philosophers, including me, say a good life isn’t just good from the inside,” says Wolf, a moral philosopher at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. Instead, a life must also be good from the outside, or from the perspective of one’s community.</p>



<p>But the emergence of positive psychology several decades ago shifted attention from the collective to the individual. Now, Westgate says, “whether or not it’s a good life is really in the eyes of the person who led that life.”</p>



<h4>Sacks’ vision </h4>



<p>Sacks’ early years were marked by heartache, according to <a href="https://www.pbs.org/wnet/americanmasters/stream-oliver-sacks-his-own-life-documentary/17521/">a documentary of his life</a> that aired on PBS in April. Born in 1933 in London, Sacks was sent to a boarding school during World War II, where the other children bullied him and his older brother, Michael. In that environment, Michael became psychotic and was diagnosed with schizophrenia. The family was devastated. Then, when Sacks was 18, his parents discovered he was gay. His mother, with whom he shared a close bond, called him an “abomination.”</p>



<p>“Her words haunted me for much of my life and played a major part in inhibiting and injecting with guilt my sense of my own sexuality,” Sacks said.</p>



<p>Sacks fled to San Francisco on his 27th birthday and interned at a medical center. Off hours, Sacks muscled up, eventually lifting a 600-pound bar from a squat to set a California weight lifting record. He also got hooked on amphetamines, thereby sleeping and eating little, while roaring high and fast on his motorcycle. Sacks, the documentary suggests, was running from his own overwhelming loneliness.</p>



<p>“That kind of sensitivity is dangerous. It requires a degree of appetite, vitality, a responsiveness, which means that you could go off the rails at any moment,” the documentary’s director Ric Burns tells me. “The question becomes: What is the relationship you’re going to have to your own appetites?”</p>

<p>On New Year’s Eve 1965, Sacks stared into the abyss of his drug addiction. “I looked at my emaciated face and I said, ‘Oliver, you will not see another New Year’s Day unless you get help,’ ” Sacks recalled in the documentary.</p>



<p>Six months later, Sacks began seeing migraine patients at a clinic in New York City. During what would turn out to be his last amphetamine high, Sacks read a 500-page book on the theory behind migraines, with detailed case studies, written by physician Edward Liveing in the 1870s. “I read through the whole book in a state of ecstasy,” Sacks said. “With the amphetamines in me, sometimes it seemed to me that the neurological heavens opened and that the migraine was shining like a constellation in the sky.”</p>



<p>After that vision, Sacks began writing detailed accounts of his patients’ experiences, a process that merged his intellectual and creative passions. Embarking on this psychologically rich literary journey would sustain Sacks throughout his life.</p>



<h4>Beyond the dichotomy </h4>



<p>In fall 2015, Westgate was a graduate student in Oishi’s lab. With lab members squeezed into his tiny office for a meeting, Westgate recalls, Oishi walked in and asked: “Is happiness and meaning all there is?”</p>



<p>That meeting and the ensuing discussion marked a turning point for Oishi. He had, like most well-being researchers, been publishing papers that worked within the happiness-­meaning dichotomy. Yet he had grown disillusioned by those paths’ shortcomings. For instance, why, as research has consistently shown, did happiness hinge on having considerably more money than is strictly necessary? And why did homogenous friend circles give people more happiness and satisfaction in their lives than diverse circles?</p>



<p>After that meeting, Westgate recalls, the team homed in on one question: If you lack money and stability, can you still have a good life?</p>



<p>The team looked for a third path, one filled with rich, aesthetic experiences. First the group <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0092656619300649">developed a scale to measure psychological richness</a>. The scale mirrored those used to measure happiness and meaning. Respondents rank 17 statements from 1 for strongly disagree to 7 for strongly agree. Statements include: “On my deathbed, I am likely to say ‘I had an interesting life’ ” and “My life would make a good novel or movie.” The results, appearing June 2019 in the <em>Journal of Research in Personality</em>, showed that scoring high in a personality trait known as “openness to experience” predicted high richness scores but not necessarily happiness or meaning.</p>



<div class="wp-block-sciencenews-content-sidebar">
<h3>Rich dimensions</h3>



<p>Shigehiro Oishi and colleagues zeroed in on the core dimensions of a psychologically rich life. <strong></strong></p>



<h5>What rings true? </h5>



<p>Below is a sampling of statements Oishi’s team uses to measure a person’s level of psychological richness, or propensity toward novel, perspective-­changing experiences. Participants answer on a scale from 1 (strongly disagree) to 7 (strongly agree).</p>



<ul><li>I have had a lot of novel experiences.</li><li>My life has been full of unique, unusual experiences.</li><li>My life consists of rich, intense moments.</li><li>My life has been dramatic.</li><li>I experience a full range of emotions via first-hand experiences such as travel and attending concerts.</li><li>I have a lot of personal stories to tell others.</li><li>On my deathbed, I am likely to say ‘‘I had an interesting life.”</li><li>On my deathbed, I am likely to say ‘‘I have seen and learned a lot.”</li><li>My life would make a good novel or movie.</li></ul>

</div>



<p>Later research revealed that people high in richness are also emotionally intense, prone to experiencing strong positive and negative emotions. People high in meaning and happiness, meanwhile, experience positive emotions more strongly than negative emotions.</p>



<p>To see how the three paths — happiness, meaning and richness — play out across life, the team evaluated obituaries appearing in the summer of 2016 in the <em>New York Times</em>, the Singapore-based<em> Strait Times</em> and a local Charlottesville newspaper. Research assistants were tasked with describing obituaries using just 12 adjectives, such as “secure” and “comfortable” for happiness, “fulfilling” and “sense of purpose” for meaning and “dramatic” and “eventful” for psychological richness. Obituaries that scored high in psychological richness also scored high in meaning, but not happiness.</p>



<p>The research, appearing online August 12 in <em>Psychological Review</em>, found that major life events, such as divorce, career changes and personal tragedies, <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34383524/">linked to higher richness, but not meaning or happiness</a>.</p>



<p>Still, Oishi and his team needed to answer the obvious: Could such an intense, unpredictable and frequently unhappy life really be a path people desired? The researchers asked more than 3,100 people across nine countries — the United States, Japan, South Korea, India, Singapore, Norway, Portugal, Germany and Angola — to score 15 terms similar to those used in the obituary studies on how closely the terms described their ideal lives on a scale from 1 (not at all) to 7 (very much). A nine-term subset of the 15 terms showed that for most countries, <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s42761-020-00011-z#citeas">people’s ideal life was most characterized by happiness and least characterized by richness</a>, the researchers reported June 2020 in <em>Affective Science</em>. Nonetheless, average richness ratings ranged from 3.7 to 5.62, suggesting that people desired some richness in their lives.</p>



<div class="wp-block-sciencenews-content-sidebar">
<h3>An ideal life </h3>



<p>When asked to describe how well nine terms that are linked to happiness, meaning or richness described their ideal lives, from 1 (not at all) to 7 (very much), average scores among respondents for “rich” words, such as “eventful” and “interesting,” were lower than scores for words describing happiness or meaning, but above the midpoint.</p>

</div>



<p>Given that ambiguity, the researchers then forced participants to choose which life they desired most: happy, meaningful or rich. Fifty to 70 percent of respondents chose terms reflecting happiness and 14 to 36 percent chose meaning as their ideal life. Percentages varied by country, but a sizable minority — 7 to 17 percent — <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s42761-020-00011-z">chose a psychologically rich life</a>.</p>



<p>When the researchers asked 1,611 people in the United States and 680 people in South Korea if their lives would have been happier, more meaningful or psychologically richer if they could undo their greatest regret in life, roughly 28 percent of Americans and 35 percent of South Koreans reported that their lives would have been psychologically richer with a do-over.</p>



<p>“That suggests to me that maybe implicit in a lot of people’s desires is psychological richness: ‘I wish I had taken on that opportunity,’ ” Oishi says.</p>



<div class="wp-block-sciencenews-content-sidebar">
<h3>Choose one </h3>



<p>When forced to choose just one path to a good life, most people, with some variability by country, opt for a life high in happiness, with meaning coming in second. Yet a sizable minority choose psychological richness.</p>

<h4>Puzzle assembly not necessary </h4>



<p>Not everyone, however, accepts the shift from a good life dichotomy to a good life triad. “There’s a bundle of conversations to be had about these conceptually tethered concepts,” says developmental psychologist Anthony Burrow of Cornell University. “Because for some people, isn’t it possible that a psychologically rich life is a life of purpose, is a life of meaning?”</p>



<p>The critique is valid. As the obituary studies showed, richness and its link to major, often negative, life events appears distinct from happiness. But those negative life experiences can foster meaning. A large body of literature shows, for instance, that natural disasters and other traumatic events can trigger a phenomenon known as post-traumatic growth: a transformation that gives people <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/what-we-know-how-mass-trauma-affects-mental-health">a newfound appreciation for life and a desire to help others</a> (<em>SN Online: 4/3/19</em>).</p>



<p>An experiment from several years ago illustrates how this transformation plays out. Before richness was in consideration, behavioral economist Kathleen Vohs of the University of Minnesota in Minneapolis sought to understand meaning and happiness in isolation, which was tricky because happy people also tend to lead lives high in meaning and vice versa. The researchers identified only those variables linked to happiness, such as satisfying one’s needs and wants, or only meaning, such as spending time with one’s children. Their findings, appearing in 2013 in the <em>Journal of Positive Psychology</em>, <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/17439760.2013.830764">revealed that happiness in isolation is linked to a focus on the present</a> while meaning in isolation connects the past, present and future, often through self-reflection.</p>



<p>The distinction between meaning and richness, as such, hinges on whether stitching together the strands of one’s life, or coherence, is essential to building a good life. People who study meaning say yes; Oishi says no, turning to fiction to make his point. In Muriel Barbery’s 2006 novel <em>The Elegance of the Hedgehog</em> and Rabih Alameddine’s 2014<em> An Unnecessary Woman</em>, the main characters are poor and lonely women who are neither interested in making the world a better place nor feel that their experiences add up to some greater whole. Instead, the two women, Renée and Aaliya, pursue lives filled with consuming literature, art and music, Oishi says.</p>



<p>“Both women appreciate moments of ineffable beauty, Proustian moments of elongated time and aesthetics, and lead a life full of inner richness,” he and colleagues wrote in 2019.</p>



<p>Oishi’s proposition is simple, yet radical: Experiences, whether mostly vicarious as with Renée and Aaliya, or firsthand, can offer a good life without summing up to anything greater than their parts.</p>



<p>“Ideally, we want to have all three: happiness, meaning and psychological richness,” Oishi told me in an e-mail. “But having just one is sufficient to lead a good life.”</p>



<div class="wp-block-sciencenews-content-sidebar">
<h3>Three pursuits </h3>



<p>Though there can be overlap, the paths to the good life have different features. Happiness tends to be marked by security, meaning by a sense of purpose and richness by perspective-changing experiences. </p>

<h4>The creative impulse </h4>



<p>After the neurological heavens opened, Sacks published his own book on migraines in 1970. He followed it with <em>Awakenings</em> in 1973, documenting the miraculous recovery and relapse of catatonic patients who began to clap, walk and talk after treatment with a medication for Parkinson’s disease, before fading back into unresponsiveness.</p>



<p>Despite his lifelong intellectual and creative frenzy, Sacks remained ever alone. After a brief fling at age 40, he was celibate for the next 35 years.</p>



<p>“He was not happy. He was creative. He was productive. And he was moving forward,” Burns says. “And I think if one is creative, productive and moving forward, one is moving toward happiness.”</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="alignright size-full"><img loading="lazy" width="680" height="497" src="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/091121_rich-life_inline-5.jpg" alt="Oliver Sacks stands next to Bill Hayes" class="wp-image-3103143" srcset="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/091121_rich-life_inline-5.jpg 680w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/091121_rich-life_inline-5-524x383.jpg 524w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/091121_rich-life_inline-5-616x450.jpg 616w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/091121_rich-life_inline-5-254x186.jpg 254w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><figcaption><span class="caption wp-caption-3103143">Oliver Sacks (left) found psychological richness and meaning, thanks to his writings and interactions with patients.

<p>Though Burns uses the term “creative” casually, the pursuit of art seems uniquely suited to those seeking, or forced into, a rich life. “People who score high in openness to experience tend to lead more creative lives,” says Oshin Vartanian, a cognitive neuroscientist at the University of Toronto.</p>



<p>And Oishi’s work has shown that aesthetic experiences increase richness. For instance, in a 2020 study in the <em>European Journal of Personality</em>, Oishi and colleagues compared richness levels between <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0890207020962334">students studying abroad and students who remained on campus</a>. Though both groups started at the same richness levels, richness scores among the students studying abroad went up after 12 weeks.</p>



<p>Student diaries revealed that the study abroad students participated in considerably more artistic activities, such as going to museums and concerts, than students who remained on campus. Engagement with art, Oishi says, “explained partially why the study abroad group had higher psychological richness.”</p>



<p>As COVID-19 variants ricochet around the globe, a great many people are now like those students studying abroad — not traveling, but dosed in a different kind of richness. Here, in this foreign terrain, we too seek beauty.</p>



<p>Scientists have largely focused on the artistic genius, the prototypic creative, Vartanian says. But the pandemic suggests that we should also study, and encourage, the everyday creative.</p>



<p>Vartanian counts himself among this everyday lot. During the pandemic shutdown, someone gave him a broken play structure for his children. Vartanian couldn’t access the parts he needed to fix it, so he learned how to chisel and do woodwork to get the apparatus in working order. “Doing things I’d never done before,” Vartanian says, “was so greatly satisfying for me.”</p>



<p>I recognize the feeling. When I entered the pottery studio, I knew nothing of the craft. Simply centering the clay on the wheel took me seven lessons. While I can now center small lumps of clay with relative ease, beautiful forms elude me. A half year on, I have thrown misshapen bowls, a smattering of wobbly cups and precarious vases that fold at the neck. I am, at my own life’s midpoint, awash in imperfect vessels.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="alignright size-full"><img loading="lazy" width="680" height="794" src="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/091121_rich-life_inline-6.jpg" alt="image of yellow and blue vases, bowls and cups" class="wp-image-3103142" srcset="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/091121_rich-life_inline-6.jpg 680w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/091121_rich-life_inline-6-328x383.jpg 328w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/091121_rich-life_inline-6-385x450.jpg 385w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/091121_rich-life_inline-6-159x186.jpg 159w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/091121_rich-life_inline-6-497x580.jpg 497w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/091121_rich-life_inline-6-665x776.jpg 665w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><figcaption><span class="caption wp-caption-3103142">Gupta has created an assortment of wobbly vases, bowls and cups.</span><span class="credit wp-credit-3103142">Adam Goodenough</span></figcaption></figure></div>



<h4>Completing the triad </h4>



<p>In the Venn diagram of the good life, Sacks spent much of his time outside all three circles. By midlife, though, psychological richness had become his beacon.</p>



<p>Yet, in crafting his patients’ stories, Sacks made his life about something larger than himself, Burns says. “He turned the mirror around [and said,] ‘I’m going to look outward in order to also look inward.’ ” Sacks had landed at the overlap between richness and meaning.</p>



<p>Then, in his late 70s, Sacks fell deeply, madly in love. After a lifetime of struggle, he finally felt he belonged, not just in literary or academic circles but within himself. In that adieu, Sacks remarked: “My predominant feeling is one of gratitude. I have loved and been loved; I have been given much and I have given something in return; I have read and traveled and thought and written.”</p>



<p>Gratitude, research shows, is the language of happiness. At the sunset of his life, then, Sacks had arrived at the junction of those three paths.</p>



<p>He nailed the ending, Burns says. “That’s given to very, very few of us.”</p>

<h2>Environmental Sustainability of the “Right to Repair” Medical Equipment</h2>
<p>A medical <a href="https://www.repair.org/">Right-to-Repair</a> (RTR) movement can improve the sustainability and the environmental impact of the medical field.  Yet, the effective implementation of medical RTR remains challenging.  Healthcare systems are progressively relying on linear supply chains based on single-use disposable medical devices. This intrinsically unsustainable paradigm of manufacturing and use of medical equipment contributes to rising healthcare costs and worldwide ecological destruction. The effects imperil public health by contaminating the air, soil, and water, depleting resources, and causing catastrophic climate change. In this respect, sustainable development is making an urgent call to change the way in which the healthcare system satisfies its needs. Medical RTR would enable medical equipment to circulate through technical cycles of reuse, repair, re-purposing and recycling. Hence, medical RTR would make possible the transition of the healthcare system to a more circular economy furthering the goal of providing increasingly complex care in an environment-friendly future. The circular economy is an essential part of the sustainability agenda and has the potential to contribute to several Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Thus, effective implementation of medical RTR has powerful effects on achieving affordable and sustainable standards for the healthcare system.</p>

<p>During the Covid-19 pandemic, medical device companies responded by providing technical information and resources to biomedical technicians to meet the needs of front-line healthcare providers.  In the United States (U.S.) last year, Oregon Senator Ron Wyden introduced the RTR act calling manufacturers to provide the technical knowledge and tools necessary for hospitals to repair medical equipment.</p>
<p>Since then, there has been significant progress in the medical RTR movement. On July 9, 2021, U.S. President Biden signed a sweeping executive order urging the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) to establish RTR regulations and to issue rules preventing manufacturers from imposing restrictions on their product’s repair.</p>
<p>In this respect, medical RTR yields the implementation of a <a href="https://www.ellenmacarthurfoundation.org/circular-economy/concept">circular economy model</a> of healthcare that ensures that medical equipment is maintained at the highest value application for a longer lifespan. It provides a way to maximize equipment’s productivity, minimize waste and achieve sustainable standards. The medical RTR can allow medical equipment to flow through technological cycles of repair, reprocessing and reuse. As a consequence, RTR legislation is expected to allow the healthcare sector in the US to become more sustainable, environment-friendly and affordable.</p>
<p><strong>Significance of the “Right To Repair” in The Medical Field:</strong></p>
<p>In the wake of Covid-19 pandemic, supply chain systems proved to be vulnerable to disruptions from manufacturing shortages, interrupted transportation systems and price increases. In addition to Covid-19, climate change remains the most important threat to the global ecosystem, including the healthcare system. Therefore, it is critical we act with appropriate concern.</p>
<p>In 2003, large hospitals in the US made up less than 1% of all commercial buildings but used up to 4.3% of all commercial energy consumed in the US. In terms of global warming, US hospitals produced the equivalent of about 215 million metric tons of carbon dioxide in 2007 (Commercial Building Energy Consumption Survey-CBECS).</p>
<p>Medical RTR appears to be a critical strategy to develop an environment-friendly healthcare sector in addition to fulfilling shortages in medical equipment. Reprocessing and repairs are found to be effective in eliminating waste and improving environmental sustainability. In fact, reprocessing companies in the United-States, Canada and Europe reduced hospital solid waste generation by almost 7,100 tons in 2018 (MacNeill et al., 2020).</p>
<p><strong>Challenges to Medical Right to Repair:</strong></p>
<p>Despite the importance of repairability for environmental sustainability, there are challenges to medical equipment’s repair. Safety, security and adaptability are the main challenging considerations to take into account when advancing RTR laws.</p>
<p>First, patient’s safety is a main priority when considering the implementation of medical RTR. Regulations and standards are crucial to ensure quality repairs allowing medical devices to function as planned. In contrast, inaccurate repairs may result in serious and life-threatening implications.</p>
<p>Second, the security consideration needs to be taken into account throughout the repair process. To this end, the patient’s privacy needs to be protected and security against hacking and other cybercrimes needs to be maintained.</p>
<p>Third, medical RTR must be adaptable to continuous healthcare innovations and to the needs of the healthcare system. Medical RTR should respect IP (intellectual property) rights as a way to continue innovation in the medical technology space. Original manufacturers may observe flaws and inefficiencies and innovate in response to clinical demands and the regulation should not inhibit these evolving specifications. However, in contexts where urgent repairs can be life-saving, such as the Covid-19 pandemic, medical RTR can help reconcile the need to preserve innovation with the need for repairability and openness in the setting of patient care.</p>
<p><strong>Road Map to A Circular Healthcare Economy:</strong></p>
<p>To make the medical RTR effective, wrong practices of design for programmed obsolescence have to disappear in order to achieve effective long-lasting sustainable development.</p>
<p>An action plan needs to include clear incentives for manufacturers to provide the spare parts, tools and necessary technical knowledge to allow hospitals to repair their equipment. Also, products should be designed to last in time and be able to be repaired multiple times before they have to be recycled. Thus, design for durability is a key feature of the circular economy.</p>
<p>In addition, rules and regulations related to medical RTR need to ensure that medical equipment is subject to high quality repairs and safety regulations. To this end, a collaboration between manufacturers and hospitals is necessary to ensure that biomedical technicians follow the same standards that manufacturers have adopted.</p>
<p><strong>To Sum Up:</strong></p>
<p>A circular healthcare economy based on medical RTR increases efficiency and offers an alternative to the unsustainable environmental consequences of current practices. An active role of the healthcare system in the ecological transition is most likely to involve a high level of concerted actions among different people and institutions.</p>

                <p class="has-drop-cap" style="font-size:20px">One can only imagine what Grote Reber’s neighbors thought when, in 1937, the amateur radio enthusiast erected in his yard a nearly 10-meter-wide shallow bowl of sheet metal, perched atop an adjustable scaffold and topped by an open pyramid of gangly towers. Little could his neighbors have known that they were witnessing the birth of a new way of looking at the cosmos.</p>



<p>Reber was building the world’s first dedicated radio telescope. Unlike traditional telescopes, which use lenses or mirrors to focus visible light, this contraption used metal and circuitry to collect interstellar radio waves, low frequency ripples of electromagnetic radiation. With his homemade device, Reber made the first map of the sky as seen with radio-sensitive eyes and <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/milky-way-earth">kicked off the field of radio astronomy</a>.</p>

<p>“Radio astronomy is as fundamental to our understanding of the universe as … optical astronomy,” says Karen O’Neil, site director at Green Bank Observatory in West Virginia. “If we want to understand the universe, we really need to make sure we have as many different types of eyes on the universe as we possibly can.”</p>



<p>When astronomers talk about radio waves from space, they aren’t (necessarily) referring to alien broadcasts. More often, they are interested in low-energy light that can emerge when molecules change up their rotation, for example, or when electrons twirl within a magnetic field. Tuning in to interstellar radio waves for the first time was akin to Galileo pointing a modified spyglass at the stars centuries earlier — we could see things in the sky <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/timeline-seeing-better">we’d never seen before</a>.</p>



<p>Today, radio astronomy is a global enterprise. More than 100 radio telescopes — from spidery antennas hunkered low to the ground to supersized versions of Reber’s dish that span hundreds of meters — dot the globe. These eyes on the sky have been so game-changing that they’ve been at the center of no fewer than three Nobel Prizes.</p>



<p>Not bad for a field that got started by accident.</p>



<p>In the early 1930s, an engineer at Bell Telephone Laboratories named Karl Jansky was tracking down sources of radio waves that interfered with wireless communication. He <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/outer-space-radio-hiss">stumbled upon a hiss</a> coming from somewhere in the constellation Sagittarius, in the direction of the center of the galaxy.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" width="680" height="447" src="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/100-worlds_spotlight-radio_inline_jansky.jpg" alt="black and white image of Karl Jansky working on his rotating radio antenna" class="wp-image-3102925" srcset="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/100-worlds_spotlight-radio_inline_jansky.jpg 680w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/100-worlds_spotlight-radio_inline_jansky-583x383.jpg 583w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/100-worlds_spotlight-radio_inline_jansky-283x186.jpg 283w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><figcaption><span class="caption wp-caption-3102925">Karl Jansky, shown here with his rotating radio antenna, stumbled on a radio hiss coming from the direction of the center of the galaxy, marking the beginnings of radio astronomy.</span><span class="credit wp-credit-3102925">NRAO, AUI, NSF, Jeff Hellerman</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>“The basic discovery that there was radio radiation coming from interstellar space confounded theory,” says astronomer Jay Lockman, also of Green Bank. “There was no known way of getting that.”</p>



<p>Bell Labs moved Jansky on to other, more Earthly pursuits. But Reber, a fan of all things radio, read about Jansky’s discovery and wanted to know more. No one had ever built a radio telescope before, so Reber figured it out himself, basing his design on principles used to focus visible light in optical scopes. He improved upon Jansky’s antenna — a bunch of metal tubes held up by a pivoting wooden trestle — and fashioned a parabolic metal dish for focusing incoming radio waves to a point, where an amplifier boosted the feeble signal. The whole contraption sat atop a tilting wooden base that let him scan the sky by swinging the telescope up and down. The same basic design is used today for radio telescopes around the world.</p>



<p>For nearly a decade — thanks partly to the Great Depression and World War II — Reber was largely alone. The field didn’t flourish until after the war, with a crop of scientists brimming with new radio expertise from designing radar systems. Surprises have been coming ever since.</p>

<p>“The discovery of interstellar molecules, that’s a big one,” says Lisa Young, an astronomer at New Mexico Tech in Socorro. Radio telescopes are well suited to peering into <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/final-chemistry-frontier">the dense, cold clouds where molecules reside</a> and sensing radiation emitted when they lose rotational energy. Today, the list of identified interstellar molecules includes many complex organics, including some <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/interstellar-chemical-resembles-building-blocks-life">thought to be precursors for life</a>.</p>



<p>Radio telescopes also turned up objects previously unimagined. Quasars, the blazing cores of remote galaxies powered by behemoth black holes, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/quasars-are-crazy">first showed up</a> in detailed radio maps from the late 1950s. Pulsars, the ultradense spinning cores of dead stars, made themselves known in 1967 when Jocelyn Bell Burnell noticed that the radio antenna array she helped build was picking up a steady beep … beep … beep from deep space every 1.3 seconds. (She was passed over when the 1974 Nobel Prize in physics honored this discovery — her adviser got the recognition. But an accolade came in 2018, when <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/jocelyn-bell-burnell-physics-prize-pulsar-discovery-interview">she was awarded a Special Breakthrough Prize in Fundamental Physics</a>.)</p>



<p>Pulsars are “not only interesting for being a discovery in themselves,” Lockman says. They “are being used now to make tests of general relativity and detect gravitational waves.” That’s because anything that nudges a pulsar — say, a passing ripple in spacetime — alters when its ultraprecise radio beats arrive at Earth. In the early 1990s, such timing variations from one pulsar led to <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/radio-pulses-hint-unseen-planets">the first confirmed discovery of planets outside the solar system</a>.</p>



<p>More recently, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/searching-distant-signals">brief blasts of radio energy primarily from other galaxies</a> have captured astronomers’ attention. Discovered in 2007, the causes of these “fast radio bursts” are still unknown. But they are already useful probes of the stuff between galaxies. The light from these eruptions encodes signatures of the atoms encountered while en route to Earth, allowing astronomers to track down <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/universe-missing-matter-found-fast-radio-bursts">lots of matter they thought should be out in the cosmos</a> but hadn’t found yet. “That was the thing that allowed us to weigh the universe and understand where the missing matter is,” says Dan Werthimer, an astronomer at the University of California, Berkeley.</p>





<p>And it was a radio antenna that, in 1964, gave <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/remnants-primeval-fireball-believed-aglow">the biggest boost to the then-fledgling Big Bang theory</a>. Arno Penzias and Robert Wilson, engineers at Bell Labs, were stymied by a persistent hiss in the house-sized, horn-like antenna they were repurposing for radio astronomy. The culprit was radiation that permeates all of space, left behind from a time when the universe was much hotter and denser than it is today. This “cosmic microwave background,” named for the relatively high frequencies at which it is strongest, is still the clearest window that astronomers have into the very early universe.</p>



<p>Radio telescopes have another superpower. Multiple radio dishes linked together across continents can act as one enormous observatory, with the ability to see details much finer than any of those dishes acting alone. Building a radio eye as wide as the planet — the Event Horizon Telescope — led to <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/black-hole-first-picture-event-horizon-telescope">the first picture of a black hole</a>.</p>

<p>“Not that anybody needed proof of the existence [of black holes],” Young says, “but there’s something so marvelous about actually being able to see it.”</p>



<p>The list of discoveries goes on: Galaxies from the early universe <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/giant-active-galaxies-early-universe-may-have-finally-been-found">that are completely shrouded in dust and so emit no starlight</a> still glow bright in radio images. Rings of gas and dust encircling young stars are providing <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/protoplanetary-gas-disks-stars-gaps-newborn-planets">details about planet formation</a>. Intel on asteroids and planets in our solar system can be gleaned <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/liquid-center-mercury-has-molten-core-radar-reveals">by bouncing radio waves off their surfaces</a>.</p>



<p>And, of course, there’s <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/seti-anniversary-new-search-methods-hunt-alien-intelligence">the search for extraterrestrial intelligence</a>, or SETI. “Radio is probably the most likely place where we will answer the question: ‘Are we alone?’” Werthimer says.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" width="680" height="493" src="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/100-worlds_spotlight-radio_inline_protoplanetary-disc.jpg" alt="red planet-forming disk around HL Tauri" class="wp-image-3102929" srcset="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/100-worlds_spotlight-radio_inline_protoplanetary-disc.jpg 680w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/100-worlds_spotlight-radio_inline_protoplanetary-disc-528x383.jpg 528w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/100-worlds_spotlight-radio_inline_protoplanetary-disc-621x450.jpg 621w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/100-worlds_spotlight-radio_inline_protoplanetary-disc-257x186.jpg 257w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><figcaption><span class="caption wp-caption-3102929">The ALMA radio telescope network in the Atacama Desert in Chile captured this image of what appears to be a planet-forming disk around the young star HL Tauri.</span><span class="credit wp-credit-3102929">ESO, NAOJ, NRAO</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>That sentiment goes back more than a century. In 1899, inventor Nikola Tesla picked up radio signals that he thought were coming from folks on another planet. And for 36 hours in August 1924, the United States ordered all radio transmitters silent for five minutes every hour to listen for transmissions from Mars as Earth lapped the Red Planet at a relatively close distance. The field got a more official kickoff in 1960 when astronomer Frank Drake pointed Green Bank’s original radio telescope at the stars Tau Ceti and Epsilon Eridani, just in case anyone there was broadcasting.</p>



<p>While SETI has had its ups and downs, “there’s kind of a renaissance,” Werthimer says. “There’s a lot of new, young people going into SETI … and there’s new money.” In 2015, entrepreneur Yuri Milner <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/search-et-gets-financial-boost">pledged $100 million over 10 years</a> to the search for other residents of our universe.</p>



<p>Though the <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/arecibo-telescope-collapse-loss-big-deal-astronomy-video">collapse of the giant Arecibo Observatory in 2020</a> — at 305 meters across, it was the largest single dish radio telescope for most of its lifetime — was tragic and unexpected, radio astronomers have new facilities in the works. <a href="https://www.skatelescope.org/">The Square Kilometer Array</a>, which will link up small radio dishes and antennas across Australia and South Africa when complete in the late 2020s, will probe the acceleration of the universe’s expansion, seek out signs of life and explore conditions from cosmic dawn. “We’ll see the signatures of the first structures in the universe forming the first galaxies and stars,” Werthimer says.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" width="680" height="399" src="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/100-worlds_spotlight-radio_inline_ska.jpg" alt="rows of radio telescopes at the Square Kilometer Array" class="wp-image-3102927" srcset="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/100-worlds_spotlight-radio_inline_ska.jpg 680w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/100-worlds_spotlight-radio_inline_ska-653x383.jpg 653w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/100-worlds_spotlight-radio_inline_ska-317x186.jpg 317w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><figcaption><span class="caption wp-caption-3102927">The Square Kilometer Array will connect radio dishes and antennas across South Africa and Australia, offering an unprecedented look at the universe.</span><span class="credit wp-credit-3102927">SKA Observatory</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>But if the history of radio astronomy is any guide, the most remarkable discoveries yet to come will be the things no one has thought to look for. So much about the field is marked by serendipity, Werthimer notes. Even radio astronomy as a field started serendipitously. “If you just build something to look at some place that nobody’s looked before,” he says, “you&#8217;ll make interesting discoveries.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/streetlights-especially-super-bright-leds-may-harm-insect-populations">Streetlights, especially super bright LEDs, may harm insect populations</a></h4>

              
                <p>Moths flock to streetlights, bewitched by their luminous brilliance. But bathing in brightness all night seems to have consequences for the grounded forms of these fliers. Illuminated stretches of English roads housed up to <a href="https://advances.sciencemag.org/content/7/35/eabi8322/tab-article-info">52 percent fewer moth caterpillars</a> than adjacent dark patches, researchers report August 25 in <em>Science Advances</em>. Streetlights could be contributing to declining insect populations in developed areas, the researchers say.</p>



<p>Artificial light is generally not good for nocturnal insects. Recent work hints the glow can <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/nighttime-light-pollution-sabotages-sex-pheromones-moths">mess with mating</a> or <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/light-pollution-can-foil-plant-insect-hookups-and-not-just-night">disrupt pollination</a> (<em>SN: 5/13/15; SN: 8/2/17</em>). But whether night lights contribute to population decline is understudied, says Douglas Boyes, an entomologist at the UK Centre for Ecology and Hydrology in Wallingford, England.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Boyes and colleagues compared 27 stretches of road that appeared identical except some parts were lit at night and others remained dark. Instead of looking at moth adults that can fly kilometers during their lives, the researchers counted caterpillars, which traverse just meters. At night, the team knocked dozens of species from roadside hedgerows or swept up larvae from grasses, catching nearly 2,500 caterpillars.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Hedgerows under bright LED lights contained 52 percent fewer caterpillars than dark sections, while areas under duller sodium lamps housed 41 percent fewer. On grassy sections, LED lights cut the population by 33 percent, while sodium lamps had little effect. LED lamps emit a broader spectrum of light than other lamps, which may explain their heightened influence. Caterpillars were fatter in lit sections, which probably indicates abnormal development, Boyes says, but how exactly LED light harms caterpillars remains unclear.</p>



<p>The United Kingdom’s moth population has shrunk by a third in 50 years, but since less than 3 percent of the country lies under strong illumination from streetlights, habitat loss and climate change are more likely to blame than the lights, Boyes says. Still, the work highlights a relatively easy way to give some insects a break, he says. Just turn down the lights, or place filters on LEDs that narrow the spectra of light they shine down.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/covid-coronavirus-vaccines-hospital-cases-rates-unvaccinated">These charts show that COVID-19 vaccines are doing their job</a></h4>

              
                <p>As the coronavirus continues to surge across the United States, hospitals are again filling up with ill COVID-19 patients. And the vast majority of those patients are unvaccinated, as two new charts help make exceedingly clear.</p>



<p>One of those charts shows that from January 24 to July 24, vaccinated individuals were hospitalized with COVID-19 at a <a href="https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.08.27.21262356v1.full.pdf">much lower cumulative rate than unvaccinated individuals</a>. And the difference in rates between the two groups has only grown over time. By late July, a total of about 26 adults per 100,000 vaccinated people had been hospitalized for COVID-19. That’s compared with about 431 hospitalized people for every 100,000 unvaccinated individuals — a rate roughly 17 times as high as for those who were vaccinated. The data&nbsp;come from 13 states, including California, Georgia and Utah.</p>



<div class="wp-block-sciencenews-content-sidebar">
<h3>Growing divide<em>  </em></h3>



<p>The gap in the cumulative hospitalization rates among unvaccinated and fully vaccinated adults 18 years and older has been growing since COVID-19 vaccines started rolling out in late 2020. The data were adjusted for age and come from California, Colorado, Connecticut, Georgia, Maryland, Michigan, Minnesota, New Mexico, New York, Ohio, Oregon, Tennessee and Utah. </p>

<p>That trend held when the researchers charted hospitalization rates on a weekly basis too. From January to July, weekly hospitalization rates among unvaccinated people were six to 31 times as high as those in vaccinated people, the researchers report August 29 at medRxiv.org.</p>



<p>The accumulation of hospitalizations in each group over time, which that first chart shows, illustrates the risk of developing severe COVID-19 overall. And its message is clear: If you’re vaccinated during this pandemic, your risk of hospitalization is much, much lower than if you’re not vaccinated. The weekly rate, on the other hand, is a bit like the speedometer on a car — providing a glimpse of what&#8217;s happening week by week as the coronavirus spreads. Its message is also clear: The risk of a vaccinated person becoming hospitalized remains low at any given time, while the risk for unvaccinated people can fluctuate, probably as a result of community transmission.</p>



<div class="wp-block-sciencenews-content-sidebar">
<h3>Weekly trends </h3>



<p>Since January, weekly COVID-19 hospitalization rates have fluctuated in unvaccinated people but have been consistently higher than in vaccinated people. For instance, as the delta variant became the dominant variant in June, hospitalizations of unvaccinated adults 18 years and older spiked while rates for vaccinated remained steady and low. The data were adjusted for age and come from California, Colorado, Connecticut, Georgia, Maryland, Michigan, Minnesota, New Mexico, New York, Ohio, Oregon, Tennessee and Utah. </p>

<p>The findings, along with other recent research out of Los Angeles County, “remind us that if you are not yet vaccinated, you are among those highest at risk,” Rochelle Walensky, director of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, said August 24 in a White House news briefing. “Please do not underestimate the risk of serious consequences of this virus.”</p>



<p>As of August 26, more than <a href="https://protect-public.hhs.gov/pages/hospital-utilization">100,000 people are hospitalized for COVID-19</a> in the United States, according to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services — a level not seen since January amid the winter surge. &nbsp;</p>



<p>A separate study, described August 24 in <em>Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report, </em>that focused on Los Angeles County also showed that while COVID-19 vaccines don’t always stop infections, the shots still prevent people from landing in the hospital. That’s even with the spread of the highly contagious delta variant, which has raised concerns among public health officials because some <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/delta-variant-studies-cdc-coronavirus-covid-pandemic">vaccinated people who get infected can transmit the coronavirus</a> to others (<em>SN: 7/30/21</em>).&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>

<p>On July 25, when the delta variant was prevalent in the county, unvaccinated people were nearly <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/70/wr/mm7034e5.htm?s_cid=mm7034e5_w">30 times as likely to be hospitalized</a> as vaccinated people, the researchers found. Only one vaccinated person for every 100,000 people was hospitalized for COVID-19. Among unvaccinated people, there were around 29 hospitalizations per 100,000 individuals. In that same study, unvaccinated people were five times as likely to be infected as vaccinated people. &nbsp;</p>



<p>While the vaccines don’t protect against infection as well as they do against severe disease, the shots are keeping people off ventilators and from dying, Kathryn Edwards, an infectious disease pediatrician at Vanderbilt University School of Medicine in Nashville, said August 26 in a news briefing sponsored by the Infectious Diseases Society of America. “We cannot lose the forest for the trees.”</p>

<p>There is no such thing as pseudoscience, and Michael Gordin has written a book about it.</p>



<p>In <em>On the Fringe</em>, Gordin, a historian at Princeton University, does not deny that there are endeavors afoot in the world that are labeled pseudoscience. Rather he shows that the term has no precise meaning, and that there is no unambiguous, universal test for delineating true science from the false versions on its fringe.</p>





<p>Many well-known examples of pseudoscience, he notes, were once mainstream scientific disciplines. Astrology, for instance, was for centuries respected or practiced by the most prominent scientific thinkers of their time.</p>



<p>Astrology’s time is long past, of course. So Gordin refers to it, and alchemy, and eugenics, as vestigial sciences — once regarded as totally scientific, but cast aside into the pseudoscience realm by the advance of knowledge.</p>



<p>Other pseudosciences arise having never attained respectable scientific status. Some are ideologically driven “hyperpoliticized” sciences; some, like creationism, are “counterestablishment” ventures that feign scientific trappings; others are wishful thinking delusions like extrasensory perception.</p>





<p>Advocates for many such pseudosciences seek legitimacy by imitating the scientific process — holding conferences, publishing journals and claiming to cite evidence (though presented in ways riddled with logical fallacies).</p>



<p>The problem is, “real” science also <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/odds-are-its-wrong">sometimes suffers from errors of rigor and logic</a>, as recent concerns about reproducing experimental results have demonstrated (<em>SN: 3/27/10, p. 26</em>). So drawing a sharp line between real and pseudo remains a difficult task.</p>



<p>Gordin provides neat, quick summaries of all these issues in his brief but thoughtful and enjoyable book. Most valuable of all is his first chapter, in which he demolishes the notion that philosopher Karl Popper’s “falsifiability” criterion allows a clear demarcation between science and non- (or pseudo-) science. <em>Falsifiable</em>, Gordin points out, is undefinable. If nothing else, every working scientist (and science journalist) should read this chapter to learn that the refrain “if it’s not falsifiable, it’s not science” is philosophically unsound gibberish, a sign of a weak argument.</p>



<p>Still, some pseudoscience is clearly out of bounds. And some would say the scientific revolution of the 17th century established new rules that filtered bad science from the good. But it still took a while for modern science to do away with astrology and alchemy. Later, eugenics and even ESP were for a time taken seriously by some “modern” scientists. Sometimes it just takes time to identify bad science and discard it.</p>



<p>As Gordin writes, science is not a “fixed repository of information,” but a dynamic enterprise focused to a large extent on “refuting or revising past knowledge.” So in a sense the scientific revolution did not really render the science of the ancient Greeks or Middle Ages pseudoscience, but rather just revealed it to be primitive science, awaiting better methods, technologies and insights. As science historian Steven Shapin opened his 1996 book on that topic, “There was no such thing as the Scientific Revolution, and this is a book about it.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/planet-habitable-new-type-hycean-search-extraterrestrial-life-aliens">New ideas on what makes a planet habitable could reshape the search for life</a></h4>

              
                <p>When considering where to look for extraterrestrial life, astronomers have mostly stuck with what’s familiar. The best candidates for habitable planets are considered the ones most like Earth: small, rocky, with breathable atmospheres and a clement amount of warmth from their stars.</p>



<p>But as more planets outside the solar system have been discovered, astronomers have <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/why-just-being-habitable-zone-doesnt-make-exoplanets-livable">debated the usefulness of this definition</a> (<em>SN: 10/4/19</em>). Some planets in the so-called habitable zone, where temperatures are right for liquid water, are probably not good for life at all. Others outside that designated area might be perfectly comfortable.</p>



<p>Now, two studies propose revising the concept of “habitable zone” to account for more of the planets that astronomers may encounter in the cosmos. One new definition brings more planets into the habitable fold; the other nudges some out.</p>



<p>“Both papers focus on questioning the classical idea of the habitable zone,” says astronomer Noah Tuchow of Penn State University. “We should extend the range of places that we look, so we don’t miss habitable planets.”</p>





<p>Some overlooked planets could be much bigger than Earth, and potentially receive no starlight at all. Astrophysicist Nikku Madhusudhan of the University of Cambridge and colleagues propose a <a href="https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/abfd9c">new category of possibly habitable planet</a> that could be found at almost any distance from any kind of star.</p>



<p>These hypothetical planets have a global liquid-water ocean nestled under a thick <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/planets-hydrogen-rich-atmosphere-alien-life">hydrogen-rich atmosphere</a> (<em>SN: 5/4/20</em>). Madhusudhan calls them “Hycean” planets, for “hydrogen” and “ocean.” They could be up to 2.6 times the size of Earth and up to 10 times as massive, Madhusudhan and colleagues report August 25 in the<em> Astrophysical Journal. </em>That thick atmosphere could keep temperatures right for liquid water even with minimal input from a star, while the ocean could protect anything living from crushing atmospheric pressure.</p>



<p>“We want to expand beyond our fixated paradigm so far on Earthlike planets,” Madhusudhan says. “Everything we’ve learned about exoplanets so far is extremely diverse. Why restrict ourselves when it comes to life?”</p>



<p>In the search for alien life, Hycean planets would have several advantages over rocky planets in the habitable zone, the team says. Though it’s difficult to tell which worlds definitely have oceans and hydrogen atmospheres, there are many more known exoplanets in the mass and temperature ranges of Hycean planets than there are Earthlike planets. So the odds are good, Madhusudhan says.</p>



<p>And because they are generally larger and have more extended atmospheres than rocky planets, Hycean planets are easier to probe for biosignatures, molecular signs of life. Detectable biosignatures on Hycean planets could include rare molecules associated with life on Earth like dimethyl sulfide and carbonyl sulfide. These tend to be too low in concentration to detect in thin Earthlike atmospheres, but thicker Hycean atmospheres would show them more readily.</p>



<p>Best of all, existing or planned telescopes could detect those molecules within a few years, if they’re there. Madhusudhan already has plans to use NASA’s James Webb Space Telescope, due to launch later this year, to observe the <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/first-known-exoplanet-rain-clouds-water-droplets">water-rich planet K2 18b</a> (<em>SN: 9/11/19</em>).</p>



<p>That planet’s habitability was debated when it was reported in 2019. Madhusudhan says 20 hours of observations with JWST should solve the debate.</p>



<p>“Best-case scenario, we’ll detect life on K2 18b,” he says, though “I’m not holding my breath over it.”</p>



<p>Astronomer Laura Kreidberg of the Max Planck Institute for Astronomy in Heidelberg, Germany, thinks it probably won’t be that easy. Planets in the Hycean size range tend to have cloudy or hazy atmospheres, making biosignatures more difficult to pick up.</p>



<p>It’s also not clear if Hycean planets actually exist in nature. “It is a really fun idea,” she says. “But is it just a fun idea, or does it match up with reality? I think we absolutely don’t know yet.”</p>



<p>Rather than inventing a new way to bring exoplanets into the habitable family, Tuchow and fellow Penn State astronomer Jason Wright are kicking some apparently habitable planets out. The pair realized that the region of clement temperatures around a star changes as the star evolves and changes brightness.</p>



<p>Some planets are born in the habitable zone and stay there their entire lives. But some, possibly most, are born outside their star’s habitable zone and enter it later, as the star ages. In the August <em>Research Notes of the American Astronomical Society</em>, Tuchow and Wright suggest calling those worlds “<a href="https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/2515-5172/ac1ea2">belatedly habitable planets</a>.”</p>



<p>When astronomers point their telescopes at a given star, the scientists are seeing only a snapshot of the star’s habitable zone, the pair say. “If you just look at a planet in the habitable zone in the present day, you have no idea how long it’s been there,” Tuchow says. It’s an open question whether planets that enter the habitable zone later in life can ever become habitable, he explains. If the planet started out too close to the star, it could have lost all its water to a greenhouse effect, like Venus did. Moving Venus to the position of Earth won’t give it its water back.</p>



<p>On the other end, a planet that was born farther from its star could be entirely covered in glaciers, which reflect sunlight. They may never melt, even when their stars brighten. Worse, their water could go straight from frozen to evaporated, a process known as sublimation. That scenario would leave the planet no time with even a cozy wet puddle for life to get started in.</p>



<p>These planets are “still in the habitable zone,” Tuchow says. “But it adds questions about whether or not being in the habitable zone actually means habitable.”</p>
