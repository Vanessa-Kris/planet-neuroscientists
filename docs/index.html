            Does non-ionizing radiation pose a health risk? Everyone knows that ionizing radiation, like gamma rays, can cause cancer by damaging DNA. But the scientific consensus is that there is no such risk from non-ionizing radiation such as radiowaves or Wi-Fi.

Yet according to a remarkable new paper from Magda Havas, the risk is real: it's called When theory and observation collide: Can non-ionizing radiation cause cancer?

          <div class="panel-body">

            <p>What makes someone a psycopath? Nature or Nurture? And can we stop at risk children from growing up into dangerous adult psycopaths? One of the oldest queries in psychology — Nature Vs Nurture — asks if what makes us who we are is predisposed by our DNA, or by life experiences. It is a pretty poignant question when it comes to psychopaths, who are estimated to account for up to 50% of all serious crimes in the US. </p>
<p>Clinically known as anti-social personality disorder in the DMS-V, some troublesome psychopathic traits include:</p>
<p>• an egocentric identity<br />
• an absence of pro-social standards in goal-setting<br />
• a lack of empathy<br />
• an incapacity for mutually intimate relationships<br />
• manipulativeness<br />
• deceitfulness<br />
• callousness<br />
• irresponsibility, impulsivity and risk taking<br />
• hostility</p>
<p>Although these characteristics may be unpleasant, not all psychopaths are dangerous or criminals, and not all dangerous criminals are psychopaths. Counter-intuitively there are pro-social psycopaths too. Nonetheless, some psychopaths do pose a genuine threat for the safety of others.</p>
<p>The real unsolved problem when it comes to psychopathy is how to treat the personality disorder. Although certainly not to be considered impossible with the malleable brains we have even as adults, Dr. Nigel Blackwood, a leading Forensic Psychiatrist at King’s College London, has stated that adult psychopaths can be treated or managed but not cured. Curing adult psycopathy is considered a near-impossible challenge. </p>
<p>Therefore, understanding when and how psychopathy develops from child to adult is an important part of the research engine that will hopefully identify what parents, caregivers and governments can do to prevent an at risk child from growing up to be a psycopath — and at the very least, find ways to minimize potential harm to the self and others in raising a pro-social psycopath.</p>
<p><strong>Development of psycopathic personalities is mainly due to genes</strong><strong>  </strong></p><strong>
<p>Enter new psychopathy research published in <em>Development and Psychopathology</em> by lead author Dr. Catherine Tuvblad from the University of Southern California. Her research was a twin-based study designed to overcome many of the drawbacks and limitations of past research. Ultimately the study was designed to provide a more reliable indication of the extent to which genes or the environment, that is nature or nurture, is responsible for the development of psychopathic personality features as a child grows into a young adult.  </p>
<p>In the study, 780 pairs of twins and their caregivers filled out a questionnaire that allowed for measuring features of child psychopathy at ages 9–10, 11–13, 14–15, and 16–18 years. This includes measuring psychopathic personality features that can be used to predict the development adult psychopathy, such as high levels of callous behavior towards peers and problems adhering to social norms.</p>
<p>The changes in the childrens’ psychopathic personality features between age groups was considered to be 94% due to genetics between the ages of 9-10 and 11-13, 71% genetic between the ages of 11–13 and 14–15, and 66% between 14-15 and 16-18. After genetics, environmental factors became increasingly more important to developing psycopathic traits as children age.</p>
<p>This suggests that environmental factors may increasingly play a key part in changing the levels of psychopathic features when reaching teenage years, which is very promising for the development of future interventions for the prevention of psychopathy.</p>
<p>It should be noted that while the children’s test results pointed to the environment around them becoming increasingly important to their psycopathic behavior, their parents almost exclusively thought that the psycopathy they observed in their children was purely genetic. Considering parents are largely responsible for their child’s environment, its not that surprising. </p>
<p><strong>Nurture is important at key developmental stages in psychopathy development</strong></p>
<p>The analysis also revealed that there is a key turning point in the development of psychopathy during the age range studied. The authors considered this turning point to be caused by the onset of puberty, when gene-environment interactions that are highly significant in inhibiting or promoting the development of psychopathy are at play. </p>
<p>Interestingly, the data also indicates that if these rapid gene-environment based changes in psychopathy development occur early on (e.g. 11-13), any later additional environmental changes to psychopathic traits would be minimal. In other words, once the psychopathic personality traits are set during puberty, they tend to last into later years.</p>
<p>Other research has found that there may be other key turning points on route to becoming a psychopath much earlier in life. One study found that the total number of early negative life events between the ages of 0-4 were positively correlated with the emotion-based aspects of psychopathy. The findings suggest that early environmental factors could have important implications for the development of psychopathic traits and may also impact attachment to parents for children with genetic potential for psychopathy.</p>
<p>So although psychopathy is largely genetic, where it’s mostly down to if you have the right combination of genes needed to become a psychopath or not, life experiences during puberty and early infant years could make or break a potential psychopath. </p>
<p><strong>The cure for psychopathy is love?</strong></p>
<p>So what does science suggest as a successful environmental antidote to developing psychopathy? Believe it or not, love!</p>
<p>One neuroscientist, Dr. James Fallon, made a shocking discovery that on paper he is a psychopath. For example, he had a version of the monoamine oxidase A (MAOA) gene that is linked with violent crime and psychopathy. Also known as the warrior gene, MAOA encodes an enzyme that affects the neurotransmitters dopamine, norepinephrine, and serotonin.</p>
<p>His brain scans also resembled those of a psychopath. He had low activity in certain areas of the frontal and temporal lobes linked challenges with empathy, morality and self-control. In his family tree, there were also seven alleged murderers. </p>
<p>Although Dr. Fallon, in his own words, is obnoxiously competitive, kind of an asshole and won’t even let his grandchildren win games, he was certainly not a dangerous psychopath. So why not? His genes and even his brain screamed potential for antisocial psychopathy.</p>
<p>His answer was that the love he received from his mother led to him becoming a pro-social psycopath. And a newly published study tends to agree with him. OK love in itself is not enough. But, how a mother expresses that love in guiding the child’s pro-social behavior and in setting good examples of pro-social behavior might be the real key.</p>
<p>A new discovery coming from research on adopted infants suggests this is the case. Researchers found that the development of one of the largest child risk factors for psychopathy, that is highly heritable from biological mothers with severe antisocial behaviors — callous-unemotional behavior — was inhibited by high levels of positive reinforcement at 18 months by the adopted mother. </p>
<p>Further research will hopefully identify a whole repertoire of ways parents, schools and governments alike can lovingly nurture the development of at risk children through these key developmental stages. Ultimately, this could stop a large amount of future violent criminals literally in their diapers, before they even start.</p>

<p><em>Bernadette Ann-Marie O’Hare, Delan Devakumar, and Stephen Allen</em></p>
<p>Health professionals in low-income countries spend much of their professional lives dealing with the consequences of deficiencies in human rights for children, but have little influence over many factors that impact on this. Bernadette Ann-Marie O’Hare et al. discussed a framework in their article within which healthcare workers can carry out an audit and be agents for change at a local level. Looking at basic rights such as access to clean water, sanitation, food, shelter, education, and health, O’Hare et al. notified that such audits can provide information on the proportion of children living in a catchment who do not have access to their basic rights, and achieve several objectives. Aside from raising awareness on basic human rights and their importance to health, the audits could give the healthcare worker an informed voice to advocate at forums such as district councils, and legitimise their role as agents for change. Results could also help negotiations with international and non-governmental organizations that often arrive in a district with a predetermined set of objectives.</p>

<h3><strong>Maternity care and Human Rights: what do women think?</strong></h3>
<p><em>Andrea Solnes Miltenburg, Fleur Lambermon, Cees Hamelink, and Tarek Meguid</em></p>
<p>Andrea Solnes Miltenburg et al. explored women’s perspectives and experiences of maternal health services through a human rights perspective in Magu District, Tanzania. By conducting 36 semi-structured interviews with 17 women, a series of important themes emerged surrounding the topic of maternity care. These included dignity, autonomy, equality, and security. Miltenburg et al. concluded that while Tanzanian women are aware that substandard care was present, the same women are able to voice what basic human rights principles mean to them as well as their desired applications in maternal health service provision.</p>

<h3><strong>Violence against women engaged in sex work</strong></h3>
<p><em>Laura Cordisco Tsai, Catherine E. Carlson, Toivgoo Aira, Andrea Norcini Pala, Marion Riedel, and Susan S. Witte</em></p>
<p>Women who engage in sex work are at risk of experiencing violence from numerous perpetrators, including paying partners. Laura Cordisco Tsai et al. moved away from existing literature, which looks at the impact of microfinance interventions on women’s experiences of intimate partner violence, and towards the impact of microfinance among women engaged specifically in sex work and at risk of violence from paying partners. Looking at Mongolia as a case study, Laura Cordisco Tsai et al. concluded that participation in a microsavings intervention did not reduce exposure to paying partner violence despite it reducing the reliance on sex work from income in participants. This is contrary to previous studies that have found microfinance participation to be protective from violence and follow up work is needed to better understand the reasons for this.</p>

<h3><strong>Mental Health Laws and Policies in High-Income Countries</strong></h3>
<p><em>Steven J. Hoffman, Lathika Sritharan, and Ali Tejpar</em></p>
<p>Steven J. Hoffman et al. questioned to what extent the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (CRPD) has an impact on high-income countries. Using Canada as a case study, Hoffman et al. concluded that there remains a divide between the Convention’s goals and the experiences of Canadians with disabilities. Canada’s reservations to the CRPD are seen most prominently through Article 12, on legal capacity for persons with psychosocial disabilities. Though a divide between Canadians and the CRPD does exist, Hoffman et al. remarked that the CRPD has helped to facilitate a larger shift in social and cultural paradigms of mental health and disability in Canada, seen through new legislation in various jurisdictions.</p>

<h3><strong>Criminalization of in-call venues and managers on migrant sex workers</strong></h3>
<p><em>S. Anderson, K. Shannon, J. Li, Y. Lee, J. Chettiar, S. Goldenberg, and A. Krüsi</em></p>
<p>Our final article by S. Anderson et al. looked at the correlation between the impact of criminalization and policing of managers and in-call establishments on HIV/STI prevention among sex workers. Drawing on 46 qualitative interviews with migrant sex workers, managers and business owners, Anderson et al. concluded that criminalization and policing undermine the health and human rights of migrant sex workers working in in–call venues. Criminalization limits the sex workers access to free contraception, sexual health information, and HIV/STI testing. Looking at these results as part of the wider context, this research supports growing evidence-based calls for the decriminalization of sex work in general.</p>

<p>To maintain pleasant public spaces requires that we all implicitly agree to certain civil behaviours, like pocketing our chocolate wrappers rather than leaving them strewn on the pavement, or turning the stereo down after eleven. But when these implicit agreements are too frequently ignored they can lose their force entirely, jeopardising the social order. To keep things together, one or more of us need to hold any miscreants to account… but who wants that hassle? A <a href="http://rss.sagepub.com/content/28/3/299">new paper</a> in the journal <em>Rationality and Society</em> explores real-life littering norm enforcers, taking us from the streets of Switzerland to the New York underground.</p>
<p><span id="more-14735"></span></p>
<p>The sociologists Joël Berger and Debra Hevenstone convened at various crowded city transit stops, and waited for a transit service (a tram in Bern, Switzerland or a New York subway train) to deposit a load of commuters. Then one researcher would perform an act of littering in front of the commuters, tossing an empty bottle near, but not into, a rubbish bin, while the other researcher observed how people responded.</p>
<p>Berger and Hevenstone were particularly interested in whether there would be any instances of social sanctioning – that is, a commuter directly confronting the offending researcher – an act also sometimes labelled “costly punishment”, because the individual has to inconvenience themselves to enforce the social rules. Social sanctioning has been studied frequently in laboratory conditions but only rarely in “the wild”.</p>
<p>Replicating one of the few examples of previous field research on littering, <a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0014292112001316">conducted on the streets of Athens</a>, Berger and Hevenstone found that littering provocations did produce measurable responses in bystanders, although at lower levels than those found in the lab, and that passive-aggressive grumbles outnumbered direct confrontation. The research also revealed two further factors that affected the likelihood of commuter intervention: context and culture.</p>
<p>Any performance needs a set, and in this case the researchers alternated between two: sometimes trashing up the bin’s surroundings by arranging refuse bags around it, and in other cases making it as pristine as possible. In grubby surroundings, less than three per cent of littering events were met with a direct challenge – “Are you going to pick that up?” – versus nearly eight per cent in a clean environment. The environment had an even greater influence on whether bystanders tidied up after the loutish experimenter – in 16 per cent of cases when clean, but little more than 1 per cent when grubby. This effect calls to mind the (still controversial) <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2008/12/23/signs-of-petty-crime-such-as-litter-and-graffiti-really-do-encourage-more-serious-law-breaking/">Broken Windows</a> criminology theory, which argues that run-down environments encourage further violations because potential perpetrators reckon their actions will go unpunished. The new research suggests that while violations may go up in run-down environments, challenges to violations may also go down, truly the ingredients for a vicious spiral.</p>
<p>As well as local conditions, cultural factors appeared to play a role. In Switzerland, nearly half of acts were met with some kind of response – a quarter of cases by subtle disapproval (head-shaking or muttering to friends), tidying up in 13 per cent of cases, and a direct intervention in 10 per cent of cases. Meanwhile in New York, the rates were always lower – only a third of cases provoked a reaction, with direct intervention four per cent of the time.</p>
<p>Berger and Hevenstone recount an anecdote: “in Bern, we even had difficulties in maintaining the litter condition. Twice people wanted to remove the bag of garbage. This never happened in NYC.” As Bern is a lot smaller than New York, they made another run in larger Zürich to see if it resembled the American city, but the data showed Zürich inhabitants even more likely to tidy up the bottle at 26 per cent, and similar to Bern in rates of direct action (subtle disapproval wasn’t measured in this study). The Zürich findings suggest a national tidiness culture rather than a size of city effect.</p>
<p>This fieldwork bears out the idea that city inhabitants care enough about their environment to intervene when someone makes it worse… sometimes. That sometimes becomes a seldom when conditions have already deteriorated. If that applies to your neighbourhood, and you care enough to do something about it, you may need to invest energy to turn things around, so that others become re-engaged with policing the quality of their environment. Sometimes, you need to start with a clean sweep.</p>

            <img alt="inclusive" class="attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image" height="110" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2016/12/Inclusive-140x110.png" style="display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;" width="140" /><p>‘The importance of being Earnest’ by Oscar Wilde highlighted the importance of knowing who you are and where you come from, and of being able to communicate that to other people. For 16 years the <em>BMC</em> series has had the aim of making scientific knowledge widely available, through open access, open data and ensuring that all publishable research across biology, health sciences and medicine has a home. These goals remain as important to us as they were 16 years ago; they are who we are and where we come from. To emphasize the importance of these principles and what they mean to us, we have clarified the description of our editorial threshold for the subject-specific journals in the <a href="http://www.biomedcentral.com/p/the-bmc-series-journals"><em>BMC</em> series</a>.</p>
<h2>A home for all publishable research</h2>
<p>Of the 67 journals in the <em>BMC</em> series, 63 have a focus on a serving a particular research community such as <a href="http://bmcpublichealth.biomedcentral.com/">public health researchers</a>, <a href="http://bmcplantbiol.biomedcentral.com/">plant biologists</a> or <a href="http://bmcnephrol.biomedcentral.com/">nephrologists</a>. These subject-focused journals form the <a href="http://bmcmusculoskeletdisord.biomedcentral.com/">backbone</a> of the series and publish a wide variety of research. The editorial threshold of these journals is to publish all scientifically valid research, without making editorial decisions on the basis of the perceived interest or impact of the results.</p>
<p>It has become apparent to us over the last year that although our aim has always been to have an editorial threshold which is inclusive, our messaging to our communities has not always been as clear as we would like. It is important for our authors to know what to expect from the journals and for our reviewers and editors to know exactly what criteria they are using to assess articles. Therefore, we have clarified the description of the editorial threshold for the subject journals. Our updated wording is:</p>
<p>The <em>BMC</em>-series subject-specific journals do not make editorial decisions on the basis of the interest of a study or its likely impact. Studies must be scientifically valid; for research articles this includes a scientifically sound research question, the use of suitable methods and analysis, and following community-agreed standards relevant to the research field. Specific criteria for other article types can be found in the submission guidelines.</p>
<h2>Why is this important?</h2>
<p>For some years now, the problems of publication bias in research have been a focus of discussions at conferences and in the blogosphere. A quick search brings up examples from <a href="http://www.bmj.com/content/344/bmj.d7762">the <em>BMJ</em></a>, the blogs of the <a href="http://publicationethics.org/blogs/publication-bias-again">Committee on Publication Ethics</a> and <a href="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcblog/2015/02/27/reducing-publication-bias-animal-research/">BioMed Central</a> and many more. The result of this is the over-emphasis of positive results and researchers struggling to publish null results or results which reproduce (or don’t reproduce) established ideas. Our approach on the <em>BMC</em> series is important in addressing this, as we ensure that all findings which are useful and which provide knowledge, information or data to the research community can be published. If a research question was worth asking, then the results should be part of the published record.</p>
<p>Addressing the problems of publication bias needs more than just a clear editorial threshold and the <em>BMC </em>series takes a variety of approaches to address this. The medical journals in the series have a policy of open peer review, with signed reports published alongside the article providing a more transparent review process, and we are also piloting a <a href="http://www.springernature.com/gp/group/media/press-releases/new--results-free--peer-review-process-to-be-piloted-for-academic-publishing/10713562">results-blind peer review</a> model on <a href="http://bmcpsychology.biomedcentral.com/"><em>BMC Psychology</em></a><em>. </em>This pilot will test whether review of the methods alone reduces bias by preventing reviewers from judging a study on the basis of its outcome.</p>
<p>As well as reducing publication bias, our approach to being inclusive has an impact on many aspects of how we interact with our authors. We want to support authors who have produced scientifically valid work but for whom language or presentation could be a barrier for publication by giving them opportunities to revise, giving clear advice about how to present and format their manuscripts, and where appropriate directing them to suitable language editing services. We encourage our editors to provide constructive comments if they believe that there are scientific flaws which would prevent publication, to support their assessment and help authors improve their work.</p>
<p>Of course, being inclusive means considering the work which is exciting too, the research which will have a huge impact, and we work with our authors to ensure that their work reaches the widest possible audience. We promote research published with us through <a href="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/">this blog</a>, the journal <a href="http://bmcevolbiol.biomedcentral.com/">homepages</a>, the <a href="https://twitter.com/BMC_series"><em>BMC</em> series twitter account</a> and working closely with our PR and marketing teams in <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-32117019">highlighting content</a> to a <a href="https://www.altmetric.com/details/3886124">wide audience</a>.</p>
<h2>What does it mean for research to be scientifically valid?</h2>
<p>A criticism aimed at scientific publishing in recent years is that the proliferation of content means that some of what is published is not of sufficient quality for other members of the research community to trust. Ensuring that work is scientifically valid through rigorous peer review processes is important to us. Being scientifically valid requires that a valid research question has been addressed appropriately using suitable methods and analysis. It means that the conclusions are based clearly on the data provided and any limitations in the study are clearly described. It also means that the research meets the standards set by that community, in terms of the techniques used as well as in placing the research in the context of what is already known.</p>
<p>In order to ensure that the work published in the <em>BMC</em> series can be trusted to have met this standard of scientific validity we work closely with our academic Section Editors and Associate Editors who provide invaluable expertise. The in-house Editors and Assistant Editors also work closely with the BioMed Central <a href="http://www.biomedcentral.com/about/who-we-are/research-integrity-group">Research Integrity Group</a> to ensure that our rigorous <a href="http://www.biomedcentral.com/getpublished/editorial-policies">editorial policies</a> are followed.</p>
<h2>Who are we?</h2>
<p>At the end of the Oscar Wilde play, the protagonist finds out to his delight that he is who he thought he was all along. On the <em>BMC</em> series, we have always known who we are and what we stand for. Our hope is that our updated editorial threshold for the subject-specific journals will help to make this clearer to our authors, editors and reviewers, across all the research communities who we serve and work alongside to ensure that scientific knowledge is available to all.</p>

            <p>Keeping messages brief and simple is more effective when trying to encourage patients to complete a health care program, according to new research. </p>
<p>In a study that analyzes six years of data, a team of researchers found small “nudges” in the right direction were a simple, inexpensive, and effective way to increase completion of health care programs, leading to a 16 percent jump in the completion rate for an already fastidious audience.</p>
<p>Dr. Dolores Albarracin, a professor of psychology and business administration at the University of Illinois and one of the co-authors of the study said that: </p>
<blockquote><p>“Retention and completion are critical components of the effectiveness of health care interventions in real-world conditions, so a 16 percent increase in completion is significant.”</p></blockquote>
<p>She noted that most health care intervention programs — for example, 10 sessions with a counselor — are expensive to implement and deliver: </p>
<blockquote><p>“Patients start but they often drop out, which is not beneficial and is a huge deadweight loss of resources for everyone. That’s why increasing retention rates is vital for public health, because multi-session behavioral interventions or a series of appointments with a health care provider are more efficacious when completed.”</p></blockquote>
<p>For the study, a randomized control trial with more than 700 eligible patients in Florida was conducted to identify a simple, effective intervention to increase the completion of an HIV-prevention counseling program delivered at the Duval County Department of Health.</p>
<p>The study involved two factors: One representing an instrumental message and the other an empowering message. The messages were brief videos played immediately after the counseling program.</p>
<p>The instrumental message reminded participants that they could discuss issues other than HIV with their counselor. The empowering message was designed to make them feel free, independent and in charge of their decision to return — a strategy that doubled enrollment in programs in other work by the same team, according to the study.</p>
<p>The idea was to use brief, simple marketing messages not for a commercial product. As Albarracin explains:</p>
<blockquote><p>“health programs to get people to complete interventions that change detrimental behavior. These messages were designed to either empower clients as agents responsible for their own change or to highlight the instrumental outcomes of the intervention in terms of participants’ lives by addressing health concerns other than HIV, such as employment or education.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Results indicated that the instrumental message alone produced more completion than either the empowering message alone or combined with the instrumental message.</p>
<p>The success of the simple, post-session message, which the researchers termed “meta-intervention,” comes down to the power of the nudge as a “gentle reminder to do something,” Albarracin said:</p>
<blockquote><p>“The word ‘nudge’ has such a nice connotation to it because it reminds us that we need to find strategies that are simple and cost-effective. In a health care setting, you need something that’s practical, implementable and inexpensive. This is that kind of approach.”</p></blockquote>
<p>For people who are vulnerable or disadvantaged, repeated contact with the health care system is important, according to Albarracin.</p>
<blockquote><p>“Contact with the public health system is often the front door to accessing a lot of other public services — mental health services, career and employment services, and other forms of social assistance,” she said. “So the public health system might design a program with health in mind, but the audience who is buying into the program has multiple goals in mind, not just health.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Having a good job or access to other services is just as important, which is why you have to sell the benefits of the program from the perspective of the audience, not of the provider, according to Albarracin:</p>
<blockquote><p>“Social marketing is a marriage between psychological approaches and an approach that has the consumer in mind. Make it recipient- and patient-centered, not provider-centered. The instrumental message capitalizes on that.”</p></blockquote>

<p>Psychologists have become very interested in the <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2014/09/05/peoples-belief-in-free-will-is-lower-when-they-need-to-urinate-or-desire-sex/">causes</a> and <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2016/01/05/students-who-believe-they-have-more-free-will-do-better-academically/">consequences</a> of our beliefs about free will.  For instance, many consider that progress in neuroscience is likely to undermine our belief in free will (though <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2014/09/23/neuroscience-does-not-threaten-peoples-sense-of-free-will/">this has been challenged</a>). And in terms of consequences, less belief in free will has been shown to affect our own behaviour and judgments, for example increasing <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2008/02/26/morality-under-threat-as-science-debunks-our-sense-of-free-will/">our tendency to cheat</a>, and making us more lenient towards other people’s criminal culpability.</p>
<p>One unexplored issue is how experiencing deep, romantic love is likely to affect our belief in free will – or indeed vice versa. A <a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1053810016302744">new series of online studies</a> in <em>Consciousness and Cognition </em>has made a start, looking at whether thinking about a more passionate versus less passionate relationship is linked with a greater or lesser belief in free will and, separately, stronger or lesser belief in determinism (the idea that the future is pre-determined and beyond our control). The answer, it turns out, is both. Thinking about a more intense passionate love affairs tends to go hand in hand with stronger beliefs in free will and stronger beliefs in determinism. <span id="more-14640"></span></p>
<p>The researchers, led by Jordane Boudesseul at the University of Grenoble, surveyed hundreds of Americans and Indians across three studies conducted using Amazon’s Mechanical Turk website. The format was generally the same for each study, but using slightly different questionnaires. Participants answered questions about the intensity of a past or present romantic relationship, and they answered questions about their belief in free will (such as whether they agreed “People have complete control over the decisions they make”) and their belief in determinism (such as whether they agreed “My future has already been determined by fate”). Some answered the love questions first then the philosophy questions, others did things the other way around.</p>
<p>The more intense the passionate romantic relationship that participants brought to mind, the more strongly they tended to endorse the idea that we have free will. Similarly, though to a weaker extent, the more passionate the love, the more strongly they also stated a belief in determinism.</p>
<p>These somewhat paradoxical results suggest that when it comes to the way we think about love and free will, we are “philosophical compatabilists” – that is, we seem to think it’s possible to be free and for life to be determined at the same time. Boudesseul and her colleagues said this makes sense if you consider that being in love can make people feel happy and empowered, as if anything is possible, yet at the same intense passion also goes hand in hand with a loss of liberty, such as being unable to stop thinking about the object of one’s love, or feeling drive to be with him or her.</p>
<p>Another less interesting possibility is that some people in the studies were simply more inclined to agree with any statements placed in front of them, whether about free will or determinism or passion – the so-called “acquiescence bias” – but the researchers don’t think this is the case (and it also wouldn’t explain why passionate love was more strongly correlated with free will beliefs than determinism beliefs).</p>
<p>Assuming the findings are real and not just a response bias, they are still difficult to interpret because they are purely correlational – we can’t tell if free will/determinism beliefs affect the intensity of our passion, or vice versa, or if some third factor, such as self-esteem, is affecting both philosophical beliefs and passion intensity. There is just a small clue, in that among those participants who recalled a particularly passionate relationship, those who answered questions about this love affair first tended to score higher in belief in free will than those who answered the questions about free will before answering questions about the relationship.</p>
<p>We certainly need more research to explore these causal dynamics further, but for now these interesting findings suggest many of us are willing to entertain a nuanced philosophical approach to life and love.</p>

<p>Alzheimer’s disease is a progressive neurodegenerative disease that destroys memory and cognitive function and there are currently very limited treatment options.  This article, published in <em>BMC Systems Biology,</em> describes the development of a mathematical model of Alzheimer’s disease that maps the neurological environment of the diseased brain. The model can be used to explore the efficacy of pharmaceutical agents that may slow the progression of the disease. An example combination therapy is applied, demonstrating how the model can be used to optimise a treatment regimen that could then be tested in a clinical trial.</p>
<p><strong>Public health: <a href="http://bmcpublichealth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12889-016-3764-8">Can mental attitude affect your physical health?</a></strong></p>
<p>An 11-year cohort study has revealed that mental attitude and personality traits may affect the likelihood of dying from coronary heart disease (CHD). Participants were surveyed at the start of the study to determine their levels of optimism and pessimism and after 11 years the status of the participants was re-examined, with the number who had died from CHD recorded. It was found that those who had died of CHD were more pessimistic at the start of the study, with the effect seen in both men and women. This study suggests that the level of pessimism could be used as a non-invasive tool, along with the measurement of other known risk factors, for determining the risk of CHD-induced mortality.</p>
<p><b>Ageing</b><strong> research: <a href="http://bmcgeriatr.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12877-016-0368-1">Being bilingual can protect against cognitive decline</a></strong></p>
<p>Cognitive decline in the elderly is a growing problem worldwide as the life expectancy in many countries increases. Understanding how this decline happens and ways to slow or prevent it is therefore of paramount importance. This study, published in <em>BMC Geriatrics</em>, provides evidence that being able to speak more than one language leads to increased mental capacity in older individuals. Participants were Mexican-American immigrants who speak both English and Spanish and represent a more culturally homogeneous group compared with those analysed in previous studies. This allowed the researchers to identify improved performance in cognitive screening tests amongst the bilingual participants compared to their monolingual counterparts.</p>

<p>Repeat photography was used to track changes in conifer populations which are disproportionately threatened by global change. In the historical photograph, 13 living trees were identified (green dots) and five skeletons (orange dots). Only four individuals had survived until 2007, with nine having died (red dots) and no new trees recorded (White et al., 2016).</p>

<p>The so called ‘Freshman 15’ refers to the weight gain that many North American students experience during their first year of college. This study, published in <em>BMC Obesity</em>, aimed to shed light on whether British students also experience similar changes in weight at the start of university. The study measured changes in weight amongst around 200 students over their first academic year and found that half of the students were weight gainers, experiencing a mean increase in weight of 3.5 kg by the end of the year. Interestingly, the study also found that 25% of participants lost more than 0.5 kg over the year with a mean weight loss of around 3 kg. This study sheds light on some of the trends that occur in weight changes at British universities with a majority of students undergoing a meaningful weight change in their first year.</p>
<p><strong>Neuroscience: <a href="https://bmcneurosci.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12868-016-0308-1">The molecular mechanisms underlying epilepsy</a></strong></p>
<p>Epilepsy is one of the most common neurological disorders, affecting around 65 million people worldwide and is characterised by excessive hyperexcitablility of neurons. The molecular mechanisms underlying the disease are still being uncovered. This review, published in <em>BMC Neuroscience, </em>provides a summary of the role of two regulatory pathways that control the expression of proteins involved in the development of epilepsy; the mTOR and MAPK pathways. Activation of these pathways is linked to increased expression of proteins involved in synaptic transmission, thereby causing the neuronal hyperexcitability characteristic of epilepsy.</p>
<p><strong>Infectious diseases: <a href="http://bmcinfectdis.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12879-016-2005-1">The epidemiology of a rare fungal disease in children</a></strong></p>
<p>Mucormycosis is a rare but often fatal invasive fungal disease. An up to date record of the epidemiology of the disease, its clinical characteristics, diagnostic procedures, microbiology, treatment and outcome in children is lacking and so this study aimed to analyse data collected over a ten year period from a range of different countries. The analysis revealed that the majority of children who were diagnosed with Mucormycosis had an underlying health condition and that the most effective treatment regimen was the use of active antifungal agents alongside surgery. This study provides valuable information on the diagnosis and treatment of this rare but devastating fungal disease.</p>
<p><strong>Cardiovascular disorders: <a href="http://bmccardiovascdisord.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12872-016-0386-0">High blood pressure and cognitive dysfunction</a></strong></p>
<p>Persistently elevated blood pressure is known to impair cognitive function, although there is some uncertainty about the best treatment options for those with high blood pressure for the prevention of cognitive dysfunction. In this review, the authors explore the current evidence for the role of blood pressure in the development of cognitive impairment and dementia and summarise the findings from several clinical trials assessing treatment options for hypertension. They highlight the importance of developing effective methods for the control of blood pressure in order to reduce the burden of cognitive dysfunction in the elderly population.</p>

 Ageing is driven by a loss of transcriptional and protein homeostasis and is the key risk factor for multiple chronic diseases. Interventions that attenuate or reverse systemic dysfunction associated with age therefore have the potential to reduce overall disease risk in the elderly. Precursor mRNA (pre-mRNA) splicing is a fundamental link between gene expression and the proteome, and deregulation of the splicing machinery is linked to several age-related chronic illnesses. However, the role of splicing homeostasis in healthy ageing remains unclear. Here we demonstrate that pre-mRNA splicing homeostasis is a biomarker and predictor of life expectancy in Caenorhabditis elegans. Using transcriptomics and in-depth splicing analysis in young and old animals fed ad libitum or subjected to dietary restriction, we find defects in global pre-mRNA splicing with age that are reduced by dietary restriction via splicing factor 1 (SFA-1; the C. elegans homologue of SF1, also known as branchpoint binding protein, BBP). We show that SFA-1 is specifically required for lifespan extension by dietary restriction and by modulation of the TORC1 pathway components AMPK, RAGA-1 and RSKS-1/S6 kinase. We also demonstrate that overexpression of SFA-1 is sufficient to extend lifespan. Together, these data demonstrate a role for RNA splicing homeostasis in dietary restriction longevity and suggest that modulation of specific spliceosome components may prolong healthy ageing.

 Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) involves substantial genetic contributions. These contributions are profoundly heterogeneous but may converge on common pathways that are not yet well understood. Here, through post-mortem genome-wide transcriptome analysis of the largest cohort of samples analysed so far, to our knowledge, we interrogate the noncoding transcriptome, alternative splicing, and upstream molecular regulators to broaden our understanding of molecular convergence in ASD. Our analysis reveals ASD-associated dysregulation of primate-specific long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs), downregulation of the alternative splicing of activity-dependent neuron-specific exons, and attenuation of normal differences in gene expression between the frontal and temporal lobes. Our data suggest that SOX5, a transcription factor involved in neuron fate specification, contributes to this reduction in regional differences. We further demonstrate that a genetically defined subtype of ASD, chromosome 15q11.2-13.1 duplication syndrome (dup15q), shares the core transcriptomic signature observed in idiopathic ASD. Co-expression network analysis reveals that individuals with ASD show age-related changes in the trajectory of microglial and synaptic function over the first two decades, and suggests that genetic risk for ASD may influence changes in regional cortical gene expression. Our findings illustrate how diverse genetic perturbations can lead to phenotypic convergence at multiple biological levels in a complex neuropsychiatric disorder.

 ISWI is a member of the SWI2/SNF2 family of chromatin remodellers, which also includes Snf2, Chd1, and Ino80. ISWI is the catalytic subunit of several chromatin remodelling complexes, which mobilize nucleosomes along genomic DNA, promoting replication progression, transcription repression, heterochromatin formation, and many other nuclear processes. The ATPase motor of ISWI is an autonomous remodelling machine, whereas its carboxy (C)-terminal HAND–SAND–SLIDE (HSS) domain functions in binding extranucleosomal linker DNA. The activity of the catalytic core of ISWI is inhibited by the regulatory AutoN and NegC domains, which are in turn antagonized by the H4 tail and extranucleosomal DNA, respectively, to ensure the appropriate chromatin landscape in cells. How AutoN and NegC inhibit ISWI and regulate its nucleosome-centring activity remains elusive. Here we report the crystal structures of ISWI from the thermophilic yeast Myceliophthora thermophila and its complex with a histone H4 peptide. Our data show the amino (N)-terminal AutoN domain contains two inhibitory elements, which collectively bind the second RecA-like domain (core2), holding the enzyme in an inactive conformation. The H4 peptide binds to the core2 domain coincident with one of the AutoN-binding sites, explaining the ISWI activation by H4. The H4-binding surface is conserved in Snf2 and functions beyond AutoN regulation. The C-terminal NegC domain is involved in binding to the core2 domain and functions as an allosteric element for ISWI to respond to the extranucleosomal DNA length.

            Most neuroscientists will tell you that long-term memories are stored in the brain in the form of synapses, the connections between neurons. On this view, memory formation occurs when synaptic connections are strengthened, or entirely new synapses are formed.



However, in a new piece in Frontiers in Systems Neuroscience, Austrian researcher Patrick C. Trettenbrein critiques the synapse-memory theory: The Demise of the Synapse As the Locus of Memory.

 During cellular translation of mRNAs by ribosomes, various situations that would result in the pausing or stalling of translation apparatus at elongation and termination steps often occur1-6. Except for programmed stalling, which is usually utilized by the cells to exert regulatory purposes5,7,8, ribosomes stalled on mRNAs need to be terminated and recycled to maintain adequate cellular translation capacity9. A large source of ribosome stalling originates in aberrant mRNAs that lack a stop codon. Transcriptional errors and misprocessing of primary transcripts, as well as undesired mRNA cleavage, all contribute to the formation of non-stop mRNAs. Ribosomes stalled on the 3’-end of non-stop mRNAs do not undergo normal termination due to the lack of specific stop-codon recognition by canonical peptide release factors at the A-site decoding center. In all bacteria, a well-characterized rescue system, tmRNA/SmpB-mediated trans-translation, functions to reroute stalled ribosomes to the normal elongation cycle and termination3,4,10-12. Two additional rescue systems, ArfA/RF213-16 and ArfB (YaeJ)17,18 that work independently of tmRNA, are present in some bacterial species, but their mechanisms are not fully understood. Here, we characterize, by cryo-electron microscopy, a structure of the E. coli 70S ribosome bound with ArfA, RF2, a short non-stop mRNA and a cognate P-site tRNA. Our structure reveals that the C-terminal loop of ArfA occupies the mRNA entry channel on the 30S subunit, while its N-terminus is sandwiched between the decoding center and the switch loop of RF2, leading to dramatic conformational changes of both. Despite the distinct conformation of RF2, the conserved GGQ motif of RF2 is precisely positioned next to the CCA-end of P-site tRNA. These data illustrate a stop-codon surrogate mechanism for ArfA in facilitating the termination of non-stop ribosomal complex by RF2.

 In bacteria, ribosomes stalled on truncated mRNAs lacking a stop codon are rescued by either the transfer-messenger RNA (tmRNA), alternative rescue factor A (ArfA) or ArfB rescue systems1. While tmRNA- and ArfB-ribosome structures have been elucidated2–7, structural insight into how ArfA recognizes the presence of truncated mRNAs and recruits the canonical termination release factor RF2 to rescue the stalled ribosomes is lacking. Here we present a cryo-electron microscopy reconstruction of a ribosome stalled on a truncated mRNA in the presence of ArfA and RF2. The structure reveals that the C-terminus of ArfA binds within the mRNA entry channel on the small ribosomal subunit, explaining how ArfA distinguishes ribosomes bearing truncated versus full-length mRNAs. The N-terminal region of ArfA establishes multiple interactions with the decoding domain of RF2, illustrating how ArfA recruits RF2 to the stalled ribosome. Additionally, ArfA is observed to stabilize a unique conformation of the switch loop of RF2, which mimics the canonical translation termination state by directing the catalytically important GGQ motif within domain 3 of RF2 towards the peptidyl-transferase center (PTC) of the ribosome. Thus, our structure reveals not only how ArfA recruits RF2 to the ribosome but also how it promotes an active conformation of RF2 to enable translation termination in the absence of a stop codon.

 Chimaeras are both monsters of the ancient imagination and a long-established research tool. Recent advances, particularly those dealing with the identification and generation of various kinds of stem cells, have broadened the repertoire and utility of mammalian interspecies chimaeras and carved out new paths towards understanding fundamental biology as well as potential clinical applications.

 The neurotransmitters glutamate and γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) transmit synaptic signals by activating fast-acting ligand-gated ion channels and more slowly acting G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs). The GPCRs for these neurotransmitters, metabotropic glutamate (mGlu) and GABAB receptors, are atypical GPCRs with a large extracellular domain and a mandatory dimeric structure. Recent studies have revealed how these receptors are activated through multiple allosteric interactions between subunit domains. It emerges that the molecular complexity of these receptors is further increased through association with trafficking, effector and regulatory proteins. The structure and composition of these receptors present opportunities for therapeutic intervention in mental health and neurological disorders.

<p>The session that I was most looking forward to at this year’s <a href="https://www.sfn.org/annual-meeting/neuroscience-2016" target="_blank">Society for Neuroscience</a> (SfN) conference took place on Sunday November 13. The minisymposium titled <a href="http://www.abstractsonline.com/pp8/index.html#!/4071/session/83" target="_blank">‘Astrocytes as active participants in neural circuits: from cells to systems’</a> gathered Cagla Eroglu, Anna Molofsky, Alfonso Araque, Kira Poskanzer, James Schummers and Benjamin Deneen; all familiar names to the astrocyte <em>connoisseur. </em></p>
<p>Kira Poskanzer, chair of the minisymposium, opened the session stating how astrocytes are still today relegated to a corner of the neuroscience field. Traditionally, astrocytes are known for homeostatic maintenance, repair, protection and metabolic support of neurons, among other functions. But the focus has more recently shifted to their involvement in synapse development and maintenance. Sharing their most recent and exciting research, the speakers highlighted the diversity of astrocytes and their important role in neural circuits.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.cellbio.duke.edu/cagla-eroglu/">Cagla Eroglu</a>, from Duke University, discussed previous discoveries on astrocyte-secreted factors, reminding us that these factors have the ability to structure silent synapses (Thrombospondin and Hevin a.k.a. SPARCL1) and also recruit AMPARs to these structures (Glypican4 and 6). Astrocytes secrete many different factors responsible for the correct formation and function of synapses, and novel studies are still trying to elucidate the exact mechanisms by which these factors exert their function on synapses. Eroglu’s lab is particularly interested in the mechanism of action of the astrocytic factor Thrombospondin, and its interaction with the gabapentin receptor α2δ-1 that promotes synaptogenesis. Eroglu guided us through their latest studies, which looked into the downstream pathway of the Thrombospondin-α2δ-1 interaction. This included exciting new data indicating the involvement of Rac1, a small Rho GTPase involved in spine and synapse formation and modification.</p>
<p><a href="http://profiles.ucsf.edu/annavictoria.molofsky" target="_blank">Anna Molofsky</a>, from UCSF, started her presentation by describing astrocytes as the “guideposts” that keep brain circuits in place. This was in reference to astrocytes’ capability to store positional information while the brain grows. Molofsky identified Sema3a as a key regulator to determine astrocyte-induced neuronal circuit organization in the ventral horn of the spinal cord. Loss of this gene has been proven to alter excitatory and inhibitory synapses in motor neurons, as well as promoting mis-positioning of synapses, and finally loss of motor neurons. Molofsky is also looking into astrocytes as microglia remodelers, through which they regulate synaptic pruning.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.neuroscience.umn.edu/ProStu/facprof/araque.html" target="_blank">Alfonso Araque</a>, from the University of Minnesota, talked about the endocannabinoid regulation of the neuron-astrocyte interaction. Endocannabinoids released from medial spiny neurons (MSN) promote Ca<sup>2+</sup> elevation and glutamate release from surrounding astrocytes. Araque’s lab has studied this mechanism in the dorsal striatum, identifying astrocytes that specifically respond to the stimulation of either D1 or D2 MSNs. Astrocytes that responded to one particular type of MSN only elicited synaptic potentiation in neurons of the same type. This observation indicates that synaptic regulation by astrocytes is restricted to particular subsets of astrocytes and specific circuits. Their latest research also suggests that animal behavior may be controlled by astrocytes and the circuit-specific synaptic regulation they perform.</p>
<p><a href="http://profiles.ucsf.edu/kira.poskanzer" target="_blank">Kira Poskanzer</a>, also from UCSF, studies spontaneous activity in the brain. She is tackling the question of whether astrocytes can regulate cortical circuits during different neuronal states. Stimulation of a single astrocyte initiated the stimulation of a whole astrocytic network, promoting depolarization of neurons within that particular circuit. Poskanzer observed that Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals in astrocytes correlated with slow oscillation across the brain and this correlation occurs across behavioral states, indicating that astrocytes may be regulating these cortical circuits. During slow-wave sleep, depolarized and hyperpolarized neuronal states are key in oscillatory activity. Since astrocytes are involved in the regulation of the depolarization of neurons, she speculates about the role of astrocytes in the regulation of sleep, or even in attention or memory consolidation, where depolarized neuronal states are also crucial.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.maxplanckflorida.org/our-science/our-scientists/james-schummers/" target="_blank">James Schummers</a>, from the Max Planck Florida Institute, showed us his research on the visual cortex organization in ferrets. I must confess, it was nice to see some research done in a different animal model, other than the common mouse model. He explained the special organization that neurons display in the visual cortex of ferrets. Neurons are arranged in columns, which place astrocytes in a privileged position to regulate specific connections. Schummer’s work has demonstrated that different classes of astrocytes are specific to the circuit, and that the organization of astrocytes is not conserved across species or even across brain regions. He suggests that current models of astrocytes need to be revised in order to account for their diversity across circuits and species.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.bcm.edu/people/view/benjamin-deneen-ph-d/b16fb055-ffed-11e2-be68-080027880ca6" target="_blank">Benjamin Deneen</a>, from Baylor College of Medicine in Houston, told us how his lab uses the term ‘astropoiesis’ to refer to the subdivision of astrocytes that determines their function. They have initially identified five astrocytic subdivisions: olfactory bulb, cortex, cerebellum, hypothalamus and brain stem. They found conserved molecular signatures across the different brain regions, but they also identified consistently different antigens that allowed them to confidently subdivide the astrocytes into those five sub-populations. Astrocytic differentiation into these sub-populations is found to trigger synapse formation. The Deneen lab has found that astrocytic differentiation in glioma coincided with an increase in seizure frequency. This is potentially caused by the triggered increase in synapse number due to the sub-division of astrocytes, or by a loss of inhibition. This finding opens a new avenue of research into the importance of astrocyte heterogeneity in epilepsy and excitatory/inhibitory synaptic balance.</p>
<p>In summary, the minisymposium revealed new research into the diverse nature of astrocytes, and their functions that differ according to the circuit they regulate or the brain region or sub-population they are part of. This is a thrilling prospect for upcoming research in brain circuits, where astroglia should definitely not be relegated to a corner anymore.</p>

            <p>“Uuuuggh…no, no, no, no, noooo!?” </p>
<p>Like a scene out of Hangover 3, the moment you remember that you don’t remember the night before…is gut-wrenching! It’s perfectly normal to feel riddled with guilt and shame as you wrack your brain for any evidence you may have made a fool of yourself the night before. Memory seemingly wiped clean, the best you can do to piece together the evening’s events is rummage through your pockets for clues, call up your partners in crime and prepare for the worst.  </p>
<p>In the past it was thought that a blackout from being on the bevy was strictly an<a href="http://brainblogger.com/2009/08/02/the-genetics-of-alcoholism/"> alcoholics </a>problem. However, today research shows that while blackouts are indeed more common in alcoholics, for at least 50% of non-alcoholics that engage in rapid and excessive drinking, blacking out is a real risk.</p>
<p>It was also a premature idea that alcohol disrupts brain function and depression of the central nervous system in general, but now we know blackouts involve the failing of specific networks in the brain. </p>
<p>A comprehensive and critical review of the blackout science research published in <em>Alcoholism: Clinical and Experimental Research</em>, provides the most detailed view yet as to what happens to memories when your brain is blacking out (<em>see diagram below</em>).  </p>
<p>Alcohol has been shown thus far to generally interfere with practically all stages of the<a href="http://brainblogger.com/2015/08/25/repressed-memories-fact-or-fiction/"> memory</a> process.</p>
<p>Short term-memory for example, can still be relatively intact when on a blackout. When short-term memory is fully functioning it tells us what is going on around us for the last 15-30 seconds or so, i.e. it tells us where we are and what we are doing essentially right now. It does this by tapping into our sensory memory (<em>see brown labels in diagram below)</em>, the super-short term memory that gives us the ability to look/hear/taste/touch something, and remember what it felt like with just a second of observation.</p>
<p>Largely stored in the prefrontal cortex , you can think of short-term memory like RAM in a computer (<em>see yellow labels in diagram below</em>), it temporarily holds the info we are currently needing to get things done.  As short-term memory still ‘kind-of’ functions during a blackout, detailed conversations are not impossible, although they may get annoyingly repetitive. And although definitely not recommended, managing complex tasks like driving are still just about feasible.</p>
<p>Yet in order to truly learn and retain information and remember the events of a night out on the town, it must be transferred from short-term memory into more permanent, long-term memory structures for storage as long-term memories (<em>see orange labels in diagram below</em>). It is the failing of this memory storage process — called memory encoding — that is completely kaput in a brain on a blackout.</p>
<p>Basically, when you blackout, memory encoding is where it all goes wrong.</p>
<p>Three brain structures in particular — the hippocampus, the frontal lobe and the medial septal — contribute to the blackout brain’s failed encoding of the night’s events.</p>
<p><img src="http://brainblogger.com/wp-content/uploads/brain-on-blackouts-alcohol-smaller.jpg" /><em>Sensory (brown), short-term (yellow) and long-term (orange) memory structure labels are colored accordingly. Red colored labels refer to those failing on blackouts. Grey colored transparent labels refer to structures connecting the hippocampus to the outlined regions of the cortex *adapted from Wetherill et al. (2016)</em></p>
<p><strong>The Hippocampus – The Head Honcho</strong></p>
<p>The <a href="http://brainblogger.com/2016/07/22/how-does-the-brain-organize-memories-across-time/">hippocampus</a>, the horse-shoe shape colored green in the diagram, is found deep in the center of the brain. Its the head honcho when it comes to long-term memories, and in the case of blackouts, their non-existence.</p>
<p>In order to successfully create a memory for long-term storage specialized neurons in the hippocampus, called CA1 pyramidal cells, communicate with other essential areas of the brain. This way the hippocampus can receive information associated with sensory and short-term memory, as well as the emotional content of the memory being processed, and relay processed information back out.    </p>
<p>Much like human’s when drunk, CA1 cells’ communication skills break down when under the influence. More specifically, it is thought that ethanol (and other drugs) activate a signal protein inside the cell called striatal-enriched protein tyrosine phosphatase, or STEP, which is found in high quantities in the hippocampus and striatum. </p>
<p>When activated by alcohol, STEP switches off proteins important for synaptic activity (the receiving and transmission of signals between neurons in the brain). STEP also results in the production of steroids that block synaptic strengthening and plasticity known as long-term potentiation (i.e. the strengthening of connections between neurons due to increases in activity that is the basis of learning and memory). </p>
<p>In summary, when on a blackout, alcohol gets STEP stepping all over the proper functioning of synapses, specifically disrupting the hippocampal CA1 cell communication needed for the process of recording a memory (encoding), and it also inhibits the neuroplastic strengthening of connections needed to make a long-term memory long-term. </p>
<p><strong>The Medial Septal – The Gate Keeper</strong></p>
<p>The medial septal is like the gatekeeper to information entering the hippocampus. It sends a type of brainwave called theta waves to the hippocampus. These theta waves change the excitement level of pyramidal cells in the hippocampus, thereby decreasing or increasing the likelihood of them being able to receive information from other structures in the brain.</p>
<p>When the pyramidal cells are excited new information has a greater chance of being processed than if the cells are suppressed. Alcohol disrupts the theta rhythm largely through suppressing the signal coming from the medial septal to the hippocampus.</p>
<p>The theory goes that without the theta wave excitatory signals coming from the medial septal, the gates to incoming information are closed, and the hippocampus can’t communicate effectively with other parts of the brain that are needed for long-term memory encoding. In fact, simply putting alcohol directly onto the medial septum causes memory loss. </p>
<p><strong>Frontal Lobe – Details, Details, Details! </strong></p>
<p>Key areas of the frontal lobe play important roles in both short–term memory and the formation and retrieval of long–term memories, including the prefrontal cortex well-known for its roles in rational decision making.</p>
<p>In long-term memory the prefrontal cortex has multiple roles, isolated to different regions within the brain structure. For example, the ventrolateral prefrontal cortex’s is specifically involved in the controlled selection of goal-relevant information. In other words, when recording a memory this part of the prefrontal cortex is involved in remembering the important parts of an event, like the specific gift you gave at a friend’s party, and not the less relevant info like the color of the pair of pants you were wearing at the time. </p>
<p>While the prefrontal cortex has shown to have reduced activity that is associated with memory impairments when under the influence, those that abuse alcohol have a very real risk of essentially drinking away the neurons in the frontal lobe, including the prefrontal cortex. </p>
<p>In fact, alcohol-induced <a href="http://brainblogger.com/2016/02/24/is-dementia-something-to-be-anxious-about/">dementia</a>, a disease caused by alcohol abuse similar to dementia, is characterized by the “shrinkage” of the frontal lobe that is associated with both short-term and long-term memory loss.  </p>
<p>However, as of yet, it is poorly understood how even acute alcohol use can leave the prefrontal cortex’s short-term memory functions relatively intact (remember? like RAM), but impair the encoding functions on route to the hippocampus. It may likely be due to the different effects alcohol has on the different types of neurons in the prefrontal cortex that are specifically important to either long-term or short-term memory. </p>
<p><strong>The Big Picture</strong></p>
<p>Understanding how alcohol can lead to memory loss is not only relevant to cases of alcohol and drug-addiction. The malfunctioning mechanisms, brain structures, neurons and molecules involved (like STEP) are the same as those involved in memory loss as a result of anxiety, stress and trauma, as well as in neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer’s and dementia. Understanding alcohol’s impact on memory may lead to the development of therapeutics and <a href="http://brainblogger.com/2014/04/07/using-neurofeedback-to-treat-substance-use-disorder/">interventions</a> that can restore these mechanisms in a variety of diseases and disorders, and give back the previous gift of long-term memories.  </p>

<div>
<p>And it’s fair to say that they received mixed reviews. Some welcomed being better informed about the <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-35255384" target="_blank"><span style="color: #0066cc;">health risks</span></a> – including increased cancer risk – associated with drinking alcohol. Others have expressed the opinion that guidelines put the UK on the path towards becoming a <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/health/12088101/Health-chiefs-attacked-over-nanny-state-alcohol-guide.html"><span style="color: #0066cc;">‘nanny state’</span></a>.</p>
<p>As an organisation dedicated to beating cancer, we were in the former camp. Guidelines like these don’t tell people what to do. Instead, they offer information on how people can reduce their risk of cancer by informing them about the risks of drinking. When they were launched, we blogged about the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/489795/summary.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="color: #0066cc;">updated guidelines</span></a>, the weekly guideline of 14 units for both men and women, and how this could be useful in helping people <a href="http://scienceblog.cancerresearchuk.org/2016/01/08/new-alcohol-guidelines-to-help-cut-cancer-risk/"><span style="color: #0066cc;">cut their cancer risk</span></a>.</p>
<p>But how easy is it for people to do this? And do we, as a nation, truly understand the links between alcohol and different types of cancer?</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/consultations/health-risks-from-alcohol-new-guidelines"><span style="color: #0066cc;">public consultation</span></a> on how the Government should communicate these guidelines closes today. And our <a href="http://www.cancerresearchuk.org/funding-for-researchers/how-we-deliver-research/our-research-partnerships/bupa-foundation-cancer-prevention-initiative/the-policy-research-centre-for-cancer-prevention-prcp"><span style="color: #0066cc;">Policy Research Centre for Cancer Prevention</span></a>, an in-house research team at Cancer Research UK, working with Dr Penny Buykx’s team at the <a href="https://www.shef.ac.uk/scharr/sections/ph/research/alpol" target="_blank"><span style="color: #0066cc;">University of Sheffield’s Alcohol Research Group</span></a>, have attempted to find out more about people’s awareness of the risks of alcohol.</p>
<p>Their <a href="http://www.cancerresearchuk.org/sites/default/files/an_investigation_of_public_knowledge_of_the_link_between_alcohol_and_cancer_buykx_et_al.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="color: #0066cc;">latest study</span></a> – carried out before the new guidelines were in place – reveals some worrying gaps in public awareness of alcohol’s harms and people’s knowledge of guidelines.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.cancerresearchuk.org/about-us/cancer-news/press-release/2016-04-01-9-in-10-dont-link-alcohol-and-cancer"><span style="color: #0066cc;">headline figure</span></a> shows that almost nine in 10 people don’t link alcohol to an increased risk of cancer. And if we dig a bit deeper, an even more worrying gap emerges.</p>
<h3><strong>Alcohol and cancer</strong></h3>
<p>We’ve written a lot about the link between alcohol and cancer – from discussing the <a href="http://scienceblog.cancerresearchuk.org/2010/01/28/alcohol-and-cancer-the-evidence/"><span style="color: #0066cc;">evidence that it causes cancer</span></a>, to talking about how <a href="http://scienceblog.cancerresearchuk.org/2014/12/03/less-alcohol-means-a-lower-risk-of-cancer-and-hangovers/"><span style="color: #0066cc;">drinking less reduces your risk</span></a> of developing the disease.</p>
<p>When it comes to the science of how and why alcohol causes cancer, the picture isn’t too clear. But there are a few leading theories, which <a href="http://scienceblog.cancerresearchuk.org/2016/02/09/how-does-alcohol-cause-cancer/"><span style="color: #0066cc;">we blogged about recently</span></a>.</p>
<p>Regardless of the underlying mechanism, we know that 12,800 cases of cancer are <a href="http://www.cancerresearchuk.org/about-cancer/causes-of-cancer/alcohol-and-cancer/how-alcohol-causes-cancer"><span style="color: #0066cc;">linked to alcohol each year in the UK</span></a>.</p>
<p>To find out how much the public knows about the link, we worked with Dr Buykx’s team to survey 2,100 people in England, asking questions about their knowledge and use of alcohol guidelines – as well as their awareness of which health conditions are linked to alcohol.</p>
<h3><strong>Public misconceptions of alcohol and cancer</strong></h3>
<p>When our study participants were asked to name health conditions linked to drinking too much alcohol, only 13 per cent mentioned cancer. They were then shown a list of health conditions and asked to name those that could be caused by drinking too much alcohol. Almost half (47 per cent) selected cancer. But this is still a low level of awareness compared to 95 per cent who selected liver disease, and 59 per cent who selected diabetes. A large proportion (84 per cent) also recognised that alcohol can cause obesity and excess body weight.</p>
<p>But people were even more unsure when asked which types of cancer are linked to alcohol, and at what level drinking alcohol increases the risk of these cancers.</p>
<p>In the study, people were asked which of seven different types of cancer they thought were linked to alcohol. Of these seven cancers, four are linked to drinking (<a href="http://www.cancerresearchuk.org/about-cancer/type/bowel-cancer/"><span style="color: #0066cc;">bowel</span></a>, <a href="http://www.cancerresearchuk.org/about-cancer/type/breast-cancer/"><span style="color: #0066cc;">breast</span></a>, <a href="http://www.cancerresearchuk.org/about-cancer/type/mouth-cancer/?ds_kids=p7227183641&amp;adc=cpc&amp;gclid=CNWq2ZPP6soCFSP3wgodtTwF_A&amp;dclid=COSbjJTP6soCFU_QGAodBssFXA"><span style="color: #0066cc;">mouth and throat</span></a>, and <a href="http://www.cancerresearchuk.org/about-cancer/type/liver-cancer/"><span style="color: #0066cc;">liver</span></a>) and three are not (<a href="http://www.cancerresearchuk.org/about-cancer/type/brain-tumour/"><span style="color: #0066cc;">brain</span></a>, <a href="http://www.cancerresearchuk.org/about-cancer/type/bladder-cancer/"><span style="color: #0066cc;">bladder</span></a> and <a href="http://www.cancerresearchuk.org/about-cancer/type/ovarian-cancer/"><span style="color: #0066cc;">ovarian</span></a>). The graphic below shows that awareness of the risk – or lack of risk – varied a fair bit. For example, only 18 per cent of people questioned correctly answered that breast cancer was linked to alcohol.</p>
</div>
<figure class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_33000" style="width: 620px;"><a href="http://scienceblog.cancerresearchuk.org/2016/04/01/worrying-gaps-in-peoples-awareness-of-alcohol-and-cancer/"><img alt="160331-alcohol-and-cancer-awareness-with-logo" class="wp-image-33000 size-full" height="880" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/on-medicine/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2016/11/160331-Alcohol-and-cancer-awareness-with-logo.png" width="610" /></a><div class="attachment-image--caption">Infographic created by Cancer Research UK</div></figure>
<div class="pw-hidden-cp">
<p>Each year in the UK, alcohol causes 3,200 cases of breast cancer, the second largest amount after bowel cancer, with 4,800 cases down to alcohol each year. Yet only around four in 10 people (40 per cent) linked alcohol with bowel cancer, and just under half with mouth and throat cancers.</p>
<p>Conversely, over half believed that bladder cancer was linked to alcohol, when research hasn’t actually found a link.</p>
<p>Next, the participants were asked at <em>what level </em>of drinking they thought a person’s risk of developing cancer starts to increase for each type. While eight in 10 people (80 per cent) had correctly said that liver cancer was linked to drinking alcohol, the majority thought this was linked to lower levels of drinking than appears to be the case.</p>
<p>In the UK, around 400 cases of liver cancer are linked to alcohol each year (for context, there are nearly 5,500 cases each year overall). High levels of drinking are thought to trigger liver cancer because this causes conditions – such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cirrhosis"><span style="color: #0066cc;">cirrhosis</span></a> – that damage the liver’s ability to repair itself.</p>
<h3><strong>Public knowledge of alcohol guidelines</strong></h3>
<p>Taken together, these results suggest that the public may not be too well informed about the health risks associated with drinking alcohol. If this is the case, simply offering new guidelines on drinking isn’t going to be enough to help people to understand the health risks.</p>
<p>But they are a good place to start. It’s the duty of the government to inform the public of health risks, and provide these guidelines to help people make decisions about their own health.</p>
<p>The new guidelines are clear that there is no safe level of drinking when it comes to cancer risk. But our study suggests that awareness of the risks needs to improve if the guidelines are going to have the desired effect.</p>
<p>Until the recent announcement, the <a href="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201012/cmselect/cmsctech/1536/153605.htm"><span style="color: #0066cc;">government’s alcohol guidelines</span></a> had not been reviewed since 1995.</p>
<p>Our survey reveals that even  though the guidelines haven’t changed in 20 years, only one in 10 men and one in seven women could correctly identify the guidelines for their own gender, and reported using this sometimes to keep track of their own drinking.</p>
<p>Now that the guidelines have changed to 14 units per week for both men and women, can we expect the public to know what they are? Our survey suggests that, without further work, this is unlikely.</p>
<p>So it’s important we – and others – continue to raise awareness of the health risks of drinking alcohol, and especially the links to cancer.</p>
<p>By helping people understand the guidelines, we hope that people will feel they have the information they need to make decisions about when they choose to drink, and how much. And that ultimately this will lead to a healthier nation.</p>

 Complex biological processes are often performed by self-organizing nanostructures comprising multiple classes of macromolecules, such as ribosomes (proteins and RNA) or enveloped viruses (proteins, nucleic acids and lipids). Approaches have been developed for designing self-assembling structures consisting of either nucleic acids or proteins, but strategies for engineering hybrid biological materials are only beginning to emerge. Here we describe the design of self-assembling protein nanocages that direct their own release from human cells inside small vesicles in a manner that resembles some viruses. We refer to these hybrid biomaterials as ‘enveloped protein nanocages’ (EPNs). Robust EPN biogenesis requires protein sequence elements that encode three distinct functions: membrane binding, self-assembly, and recruitment of the endosomal sorting complexes required for transport (ESCRT) machinery. A variety of synthetic proteins with these functional elements induce EPN biogenesis, highlighting the modularity and generality of the design strategy. Biochemical analyses and cryo-electron microscopy reveal that one design, EPN-01, comprises small (~100 nm) vesicles containing multiple protein nanocages that closely match the structure of the designed 60-subunit self-assembling scaffold. EPNs that incorporate the vesicular stomatitis viral glycoprotein can fuse with target cells and deliver their contents, thereby transferring cargoes from one cell to another. These results show how proteins can be programmed to direct the formation of hybrid biological materials that perform complex tasks, and establish EPNs as a class of designed, modular, genetically-encoded nanomaterials that can transfer molecules between cells.

 The functionality of stem cells declines during ageing, and this decline contributes to ageing-associated impairments in tissue regeneration and function. Alterations in developmental pathways have been associated with declines in stem-cell function during ageing, but the nature of this process remains poorly understood. Hox genes are key regulators of stem cells and tissue patterning during embryogenesis with an unknown role in ageing. Here we show that the epigenetic stress response in muscle stem cells (also known as satellite cells) differs between aged and young mice. The alteration includes aberrant global and site-specific induction of active chromatin marks in activated satellite cells from aged mice, resulting in the specific induction of Hoxa9 but not other Hox genes. Hoxa9 in turn activates several developmental pathways and represents a decisive factor that separates satellite cell gene expression in aged mice from that in young mice. The activated pathways include most of the currently known inhibitors of satellite cell function in ageing muscle, including Wnt, TGFβ, JAK/STAT and senescence signalling. Inhibition of aberrant chromatin activation or deletion of Hoxa9 improves satellite cell function and muscle regeneration in aged mice, whereas overexpression of Hoxa9 mimics ageing-associated defects in satellite cells from young mice, which can be rescued by the inhibition of Hoxa9-targeted developmental pathways. Together, these data delineate an altered epigenetic stress response in activated satellite cells from aged mice, which limits satellite cell function and muscle regeneration by Hoxa9-dependent activation of developmental pathways.

 Maternally inherited mitochondrial (mt)DNA mutations can cause fatal or severely debilitating syndromes in children, with disease severity dependent on the specific gene mutation and the ratio of mutant to wild-type mtDNA (heteroplasmy) in each cell and tissue. Pathogenic mtDNA mutations are relatively common, with an estimated 778 affected children born each year in the United States. Mitochondrial replacement therapies or techniques (MRT) circumventing mother–to–child mtDNA disease transmission involve replacement of oocyte maternal mtDNA. Here we report MRT outcomes in several families with common mtDNA syndromes. The mother’s oocytes were of normal quality and mutation levels correlated with those in existing children. Efficient replacement of oocyte mutant mtDNA was performed by spindle transfer, resulting in embryos containing &gt;99% donor mtDNA. Donor mtDNA was stably maintained in embryonic stem cells (ES cells) derived from most embryos. However, some ES cell lines demonstrated gradual loss of donor mtDNA and reversal to the maternal haplotype. In evaluating donor–to–maternal mtDNA interactions, it seems that compatibility relates to mtDNA replication efficiency rather than to mismatch or oxidative phosphorylation dysfunction. We identify a polymorphism within the conserved sequence box II region of the D-loop as a plausible cause of preferential replication of specific mtDNA haplotypes. In addition, some haplotypes confer proliferative and growth advantages to cells. Hence, we propose a matching paradigm for selecting compatible donor mtDNA for MRT.

 N6-methyladenosine (m6A) is the most common internal modification of eukaryotic messenger RNA (mRNA) and is decoded by YTH domain proteins. The mammalian mRNA m6A methylosome is a complex of nuclear proteins that includes METTL3 (methyltransferase-like 3), METTL14, WTAP (Wilms tumour 1-associated protein) and KIAA1429. Drosophila has corresponding homologues named Ime4 and KAR4 (Inducer of meiosis 4 and Karyogamy protein 4), and Female-lethal (2)d (Fl(2)d) and Virilizer (Vir). In Drosophila, fl(2)d and vir are required for sex-dependent regulation of alternative splicing of the sex determination factor Sex lethal (Sxl). However, the functions of m6A in introns in the regulation of alternative splicing remain uncertain. Here we show that m6A is absent in the mRNA of Drosophila lacking Ime4. In contrast to mouse and plant knockout models, Drosophila Ime4-null mutants remain viable, though flightless, and show a sex bias towards maleness. This is because m6A is required for female-specific alternative splicing of Sxl, which determines female physiognomy, but also translationally represses male-specific lethal 2 (msl-2) to prevent dosage compensation in females. We further show that the m6A reader protein YT521-B decodes m6A in the sex-specifically spliced intron of Sxl, as its absence phenocopies Ime4 mutants. Loss of m6A also affects alternative splicing of additional genes, predominantly in the 5′ untranslated region, and has global effects on the expression of metabolic genes. The requirement of m6A and its reader YT521-B for female-specific Sxl alternative splicing reveals that this hitherto enigmatic mRNA modification constitutes an ancient and specific mechanism to adjust levels of gene expression.

 Land-use intensification is a major driver of biodiversity loss. Alongside reductions in local species diversity, biotic homogenization at larger spatial scales is of great concern for conservation. Biotic homogenization means a decrease in β-diversity (the compositional dissimilarity between sites). Most studies have investigated losses in local (α)-diversity and neglected biodiversity loss at larger spatial scales. Studies addressing β-diversity have focused on single or a few organism groups (for example, ref. 4), and it is thus unknown whether land-use intensification homogenizes communities at different trophic levels, above- and belowground. Here we show that even moderate increases in local land-use intensity (LUI) cause biotic homogenization across microbial, plant and animal groups, both above- and belowground, and that this is largely independent of changes in α-diversity. We analysed a unique grassland biodiversity dataset, with abundances of more than 4,000 species belonging to 12 trophic groups. LUI, and, in particular, high mowing intensity, had consistent effects on β-diversity across groups, causing a homogenization of soil microbial, fungal pathogen, plant and arthropod communities. These effects were nonlinear and the strongest declines in β-diversity occurred in the transition from extensively managed to intermediate intensity grassland. LUI tended to reduce local α-diversity in aboveground groups, whereas the α-diversity increased in belowground groups. Correlations between the β-diversity of different groups, particularly between plants and their consumers, became weaker at high LUI. This suggests a loss of specialist species and is further evidence for biotic homogenization. The consistently negative effects of LUI on landscape-scale biodiversity underscore the high value of extensively managed grasslands for conserving multitrophic biodiversity and ecosystem service provision. Indeed, biotic homogenization rather than local diversity loss could prove to be the most substantial consequence of land-use intensification.

 N6-methyladenosine RNA (m6A) is a prevalent messenger RNA modification in vertebrates. Although its functions in the regulation of post-transcriptional gene expression are beginning to be unveiled, the precise roles of m6A during development of complex organisms remain unclear. Here we carry out a comprehensive molecular and physiological characterization of the individual components of the methyltransferase complex, as well as of the YTH domain-containing nuclear reader protein in Drosophila melanogaster. We identify the member of the split ends protein family, Spenito, as a novel bona fide subunit of the methyltransferase complex. We further demonstrate important roles of this complex in neuronal functions and sex determination, and implicate the nuclear YT521-B protein as a main m6A effector in these processes. Altogether, our work substantially extends our knowledge of m6A biology, demonstrating the crucial functions of this modification in fundamental processes within the context of the whole animal.

 In eukaryotes, up to one-third of cellular proteins are targeted to the endoplasmic reticulum, where they undergo folding, processing, sorting and trafficking to subsequent endomembrane compartments. Targeting to the endoplasmic reticulum has been shown to occur co-translationally by the signal recognition particle (SRP) pathway or post-translationally by the mammalian transmembrane recognition complex of 40 kDa (TRC40) and homologous yeast guided entry of tail-anchored proteins (GET) pathways. Despite the range of proteins that can be catered for by these two pathways, many proteins are still known to be independent of both SRP and GET, so there seems to be a critical need for an additional dedicated pathway for endoplasmic reticulum relay. We set out to uncover additional targeting proteins using unbiased high-content screening approaches. To this end, we performed a systematic visual screen using the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, and uncovered three uncharacterized proteins whose loss affected targeting. We suggest that these proteins work together and demonstrate that they function in parallel with SRP and GET to target a broad range of substrates to the endoplasmic reticulum. The three proteins, which we name Snd1, Snd2 and Snd3 (for SRP-independent targeting), can synthetically compensate for the loss of both the SRP and GET pathways, and act as a backup targeting system. This explains why it has previously been difficult to demonstrate complete loss of targeting for some substrates. Our discovery thus puts in place an essential piece of the endoplasmic reticulum targeting puzzle, highlighting how the targeting apparatus of the eukaryotic cell is robust, interlinked and flexible.

            <p>Chromosomes are folded into highly compacted structures to accommodate physical constraints within nuclei and to regulate access to genomic information. Recently, global mapping of pairwise contacts showed that loops anchoring topological domains (TADs) are highly conserved between cell types and species. Whether pairwise loops synergize to form higher-order structures is still unclear. Here we develop a conformation capture assay to study higher-order organization using chromosomal walks (C-walks) that link multiple genomic loci together into proximity chains in human and mouse cells. This approach captures chromosomal structure at varying scales. Inter-chromosomal contacts constitute only 7–10% of the pairs and are restricted by interfacing TADs. About half of the C-walks stay within one chromosome, and almost half of those are restricted to intra-TAD spaces. C-walks that couple 2–4 TADs indicate stochastic associations between transcriptionally active, early replicating loci. Targeted analysis of thousands of 3-walks anchored at highly expressed genes support pairwise, rather than hub-like, chromosomal topology at active loci. Polycomb-repressed Hox domains are shown by the same approach to enrich for synergistic hubs. Together, the data indicate that chromosomal territories, TADs, and intra-TAD loops are primarily driven by nested, possibly dynamic, pairwise contacts.</p><p>Nature   <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/nature20158">doi: 10.1038/nature20158</a></p><img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/NatureBiologicalSciencesResearch/~4/L37_FIZut08" width="1" />

 The majority of the Earth’s terrestrial carbon is stored in the soil. If anthropogenic warming stimulates the loss of this carbon to the atmosphere, it could drive further planetary warming. Despite evidence that warming enhances carbon fluxes to and from the soil, the net global balance between these responses remains uncertain. Here we present a comprehensive analysis of warming-induced changes in soil carbon stocks by assembling data from 49 field experiments located across North America, Europe and Asia. We find that the effects of warming are contingent on the size of the initial soil carbon stock, with considerable losses occurring in high-latitude areas. By extrapolating this empirical relationship to the global scale, we provide estimates of soil carbon sensitivity to warming that may help to constrain Earth system model projections. Our empirical relationship suggests that global soil carbon stocks in the upper soil horizons will fall by 30 ± 30 petagrams of carbon to 203 ± 161 petagrams of carbon under one degree of warming, depending on the rate at which the effects of warming are realized. Under the conservative assumption that the response of soil carbon to warming occurs within a year, a business-as-usual climate scenario would drive the loss of 55 ± 50 petagrams of carbon from the upper soil horizons by 2050. This value is around 12–17 per cent of the expected anthropogenic emissions over this period. Despite the considerable uncertainty in our estimates, the direction of the global soil carbon response is consistent across all scenarios. This provides strong empirical support for the idea that rising temperatures will stimulate the net loss of soil carbon to the atmosphere, driving a positive land carbon–climate feedback that could accelerate climate change.
