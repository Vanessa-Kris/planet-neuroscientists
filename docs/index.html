These sex differences are easy to observe, with the showy tail feathers of male peacocks and the mane of the lion being some of the most well-known examples.</p>
<p>For years scientists have thought that such differences between sexes are probably a result of sexual selection. This means that the traits that differ between males and females (e.g. elaborate plumage or a mane) are the result of females preferring this trait. But what if they are not? What if differences between males and females are caused by something else? And what if females are also pretty?</p>
<p><strong>Our study subject</strong></p>
<p>Australia is famous for having deadly and bizarre animals, but it also has a very special family of birds, the fairy-wrens. This group of small birds (~ 14 species) from the family Maluridae are famous because they are highly promiscuous and also because they have very bright plumage colourations that reflect ultraviolet light (see above photo).</p>
<p>Male plumage in fairy-wrens possibly evolved as a result of sexual selection (e.g. females preferring bright males). Interestingly, there is also very high variation in plumage across female fairy-wrens. Females from some species are brown and very dull (as in the photo below), while some have blue and bright colourations, just like males. In our recent study we wanted to understand why.</p>

<p><strong>What we found</strong></p>
<p>We went to different museums across Australia and used museum specimens to quantify colour using standard techniques. We measured colour in many individuals and different fairy-wren species, and investigated their geographic distributions. With this information we were able to discover that females of species that lived in open habitats, like grasslands, were more likely to have dull colourations. On the other hand, females from those species that lived in closed habitats, such as forests, tended to have brighter and more colorful plumages, like those of males.</p>
<p><strong>What does this mean?</strong></p>
<p>Our results suggest that evolution of females with cryptic (e.g. dull) plumages is favoured in open habitats, possibly because predation risk is higher in this type of environment and dull plumages camouflage more readily.</p>
<p>These results change our way of thinking about differences in plumage between males and females. They tell us that sex differences in plumage in fairy-wrens are not only driven by sexual preferences. Habitat and natural selection may also drive the evolution of female plumage, resulting in differences between males and females. This means that female birds can also be as pretty as males, depending on where they live.</p>

            <p><em><img alt="Thoughtful and sad little girl" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-18165" src="https://researchdigest.files.wordpress.com/2017/01/thinkstockphotos-518219250.jpg?w=845" />By</em> <a href="http://www.psychologywriter.org.uk/">Christian Jarrett</a></p>
<p>A hugely controversial topic in psychology concerns how likely it is that some or many claims of abuse made by children are actually based on <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2016/05/26/its-easy-to-implant-false-childhood-memories-right-wrong-says-a-new-review/">false memories</a>, possibly implanted through the suggestions of therapists or leading questions from investigators. A related issue is whether going through the terrible experience of being mistreated makes it more or less likely that a child will be prone to forming false memories based on the suggestions or leading questions of others. In a small but important <a href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/bjdp.12177/abstract?campaign=wolearlyview">new study</a> in the <em>British Journal of Developmental Psychology</em>, a team led by Henry Otgaar at Maastricht University report that while a group of maltreated children were more prone to spontaneous false memories than control participants, they were in fact, to the researchers’ surprise, less prone to false memories based on suggestion. “This is a hitherto unreported finding,” they said.</p>
<p><span id="more-18019"></span></p>
<p>Otgaar and his colleagues tested 127 4- to 12-year-old children, 21 of whom were suspected of having been physically or sexually abused. The children in the mistreated group were recruited through their parents or guardians from a forensic child abuse centre and a child interrogation studio in the Netherlands. All those recruited from the interrogation studio were involved in legal cases related to alleged sexual abuse. The children who formed the control group were recruited from local primary schools in middle class areas. To provide further verification of the children’s status, all parents or guardians completed a trauma questionnaire about their child, and this indicated, as expected, that the maltreated group had experienced significantly more trauma than the control participants.</p>
<p>The researchers tested the children’s susceptibility to false memories in two ways. The first involved the children remembering lists of words on a related theme, and then judging which words among another series had appeared in that earlier list and which were new (this is known as the Deese-Roediger-McDermott false memory paradigm). Wrongly claiming that a related but new word was in the earlier list was interpreted as an instance of a spontaneous false memory. For initial word lists that had a negative theme, children in the mistreated group were more prone to false memories. The researchers suggested this is because, given their experiences, they “might be more prone to automatically activate related but non-presented negative information in memory during encoding”.</p>
<p>To test the children’s susceptibility to false memories arising from suggestion, the researchers asked the children to watch a video of a bank robbery, and then to listen to an eye witness account of what happened. Crucially, the eye witness testimony featured five false claims about items involved in the robbery (this is a version of the “misinformation paradigm” developed by Elizabeth Loftus, a pioneer in this field). When the children were subsequently tested on what items had been involved during the robbery, those in the mistreated group were less prone to making errors based on the false claims in the eye witness testimony – that is they were less vulnerable to false memories arising from suggestion.</p>
<p>This finding about suggestibility is slightly complicated by the fact the mistreated group also failed to correctly identify as many items that really had been involved in the robbery. This might have protected them from suggestion because the falsehoods in the eye witness statement were related to actual items in the robbery. Not remembering the real items would make it harder to form false memories of related items that hadn’t actually featured in the robbery. For comparison, <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18020811">a previous study</a> using different methods found no difference in suggestibility between abused and control groups.</p>
<p>Given the small sample size of mistreated children and the researchers’ inability to substantiate definitively the claims about what abuse the mistreated children had or hadn’t suffered, these new results should be considered highly tentative. However, the researchers said the findings could definitely be of legal relevance. “Our new angle on this debate is that our results suggest that trauma does affect memory, but in a rather complex and unique way,” they said.</p>

 Deuterostomes include the group we belong to (vertebrates) as well as an array of disparate forms that include echinoderms, hemichordates and more problematic groups such as vetulicolians and vetulocystids. The Cambrian fossil record is well-populated with representative examples, but possible intermediates are controversial and the nature of the original deuterostome remains idealized. Here we report millimetric fossils, Saccorhytus coronarius nov. gen., nov. sp., from an Orsten-like Lagerstätte from the earliest Cambrian period of South China, which stratigraphically are amongst the earliest of deuterostomes. The bag-like body bears a prominent mouth and associated folds, and behind them up to four conical openings on either side of the body as well as possible sensory structures. An anus may have been absent, and correspondingly the lateral openings probably served to expel water and waste material. This new form has similarities to both the vetulicolians and vetulocystids and collectively these findings suggest that a key step in deuterostome evolution was the development of lateral openings that subsequently were co-opted as pharyngeal gills. Depending on its exact phylogenetic position, the meiofaunal habit of Saccorhytus may help to explain the major gap between divergence times seen in the fossil record and estimates based on molecular clocks.

            <p>
 Land degradation results in declining biodiversity and the disruption of ecosystem functioning worldwide, particularly in the tropics. Vegetation restoration is a common tool used to mitigate these impacts and increasingly aims to restore ecosystem functions rather than species diversity. However, evidence from community experiments on the effect of restoration practices on ecosystem functions is scarce. Pollination is an important ecosystem function and the global decline in pollinators attenuates the resistance of natural areas and agro-environments to disturbances. Thus, the ability of pollination functions to resist or recover from disturbance (that is, the functional resilience) may be critical for ensuring a successful restoration process. Here we report the use of a community field experiment to investigate the effects of vegetation restoration, specifically the removal of exotic shrubs, on pollination. We analyse 64 plant–pollinator networks and the reproductive performance of the ten most abundant plant species across four restored and four unrestored, disturbed mountaintop communities. Ecosystem restoration resulted in a marked increase in pollinator species, visits to flowers and interaction diversity. Interactions in restored networks were more generalized than in unrestored networks, indicating a higher functional redundancy in restored communities. Shifts in interaction patterns had direct and positive effects on pollination, especially on the relative and total fruit production of native plants. Pollinator limitation was prevalent at unrestored sites only, where the proportion of flowers producing fruit increased with pollinator visitation, approaching the higher levels seen in restored plant communities. Our results show that vegetation restoration can improve pollination, suggesting that the degradation of ecosystem functions is at least partially reversible. The degree of recovery may depend on the state of degradation before restoration intervention and the proximity to pollinator source populations in the surrounding landscape. We demonstrate that network structure is a suitable indicator for pollination quality, highlighting the usefulness of interaction networks in environmental management.

 During puberty, the mouse mammary gland develops into a highly branched epithelial network. Owing to the absence of exclusive stem cell markers, the location, multiplicity, dynamics and fate of mammary stem cells (MaSCs), which drive branching morphogenesis, are unknown. Here we show that morphogenesis is driven by proliferative terminal end buds that terminate or bifurcate with near equal probability, in a stochastic and time-invariant manner, leading to a heterogeneous epithelial network. We show that the majority of terminal end bud cells function as highly proliferative, lineage-committed MaSCs that are heterogeneous in their expression profile and short-term contribution to ductal extension. Yet, through cell rearrangements during terminal end bud bifurcation, each MaSC is able to contribute actively to long-term growth. Our study shows that the behaviour of MaSCs is not directly linked to a single expression profile. Instead, morphogenesis relies upon lineage-restricted heterogeneous MaSC populations that function as single equipotent pools in the long term.

            President Trump this week repeated an assertion  he made shortly after his election: that millions of ballots cast illegally by undocumented immigrants cost him the popular vote. If true, this would suggest the wholesale corruption of American democracy.

Not  to worry: As far as anyone knows, the president’s assertion is akin to  saying that millions of unicorns also voted illegally.

            When we're feeling very tired, we sometimes remark that we're "half-asleep". But is this more than just a figure of speech? A new paper suggests that parts of our brain may actually 'fall asleep' even while we're still awake.



According to researchers Jeremy D. Slater and colleagues of the University of Texas, "local sleep" occurs throughout the human brain, with each brain region passing into and out of a sleep-like state over time. What's more, local sleep becomes more and more common in

<p>Theory of Mind is psychologist-speak for our ability to put ourselves in other people’s shoes, to recognise that their thoughts and beliefs can be different from our own. Children begin to develop this ability around age three to four: it starts off fairly basic, in terms of understanding people can hold false beliefs, becoming more sophisticated as they get older, eventually taking in concepts like double bluffing and faux pas.</p>
<p>Of course, as with most things, kids vary in how adept they are at Theory of Mind, and there’s evidence that those with more skills in this area benefit in all sorts of ways, from their relationships to school achievement. Importantly, experiments have shown that this isn’t something that’s fixed, rather children can be trained fairly easily to improve their Theory of Mind by spending time talking about and reflecting upon characters’ perspectives in social scenarios.</p>
<p>These previous training studies have been contrived experiments delivered by researchers with the sessions conducted outside of normal classes. A promising but <a href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/bjep.12125/abstract?systemMessage=WOL+Usage+report+download+page+will+be+unavailable+on+Friday+27th+January+2017+at+23%3A00+GMT%2F+18%3A00+EST%2F+07%3A00+SGT+%28Saturday+28th+Jan+for+SGT%29++for+up+to+2+hours+due+to+essential+server+maintenance.+Apologies+for+the+inconvenience.">preliminary new study</a> in the <em>British Journal of Educational Psychology</em> has made an important leap, taking the training to a more real-life setting, showing that a brief teacher-led intervention was able to boost eight- to nine-year-olds’ Theory of Mind, with the benefits still demonstrable two months later.</p>
<p><span id="more-17902"></span></p>
<p>Federico Bianco and Serena Lecce trained four teachers at four different primary schools how to deliver a Theory of Mind intervention that involved the children reading about different social situations, writing answers to questions about the thoughts and perspectives of the different characters, and then discussing the stories in groups. The stories involved misunderstandings, sarcasm, faux pas and a double bluff. The teachers were trained to provide feedback to correct the pupils when necessary. The teachers also learned how to deliver a control intervention that was similar but involved reflecting on physical aspects of stories: for instance, a typical question might ask what materials an architect should use for tall buildings.</p>
<p>The Theory of Mind training – four sessions of 50 minutes – was given by the teachers to one of their usual classes, and the control training of equal length to another class. This meant 34 eight-year-olds received the Theory of Mind training, and 38 acted as controls. Meanwhile, the pupils completed various tests before the training, such as verbal ability  and executive training tests, and answered questions about their family background. Critically, before the training, one week afterwards and two months afterwards, they also completed a test of their Theory of Mind skills, based on their comprehension of three stories involving double bluff, persuasion and misunderstanding.</p>
<p>All the children showed improvements in their Theory of Mind test performance over the course of the study, but the children who received the Theory of Mind training showed greater gains than the control group. And while the two groups showed equal Theory of Mind skills pre-training, after they’d completed their training, the Theory of Mind training group were superior at both the one week and two month follow up. The apparent benefits of the Theory of Mind training remained after controlling in the analysis for the influence of other abilities such as verbal skill or other factors like family background.</p>
<p>Bianco and Lecce said their results suggest teachers “can successfully promote their 8- to 9-year-old pupils’ Theory of Mind development during regular teaching hours” and that they hoped this might be the “first step of a new line of research aimed at translating Theory of Mind research into school life practices.”</p>
<p>On a more sceptical note, there wasn’t a no-treatment control condition, so we can’t tell for sure whether the Theory of Mind training boosted Theory of Mind or if the physical concepts training  was for some reason detrimental to Theory of Mind. Also, the test of Theory of Mind was remarkably similar to the training (all scenarios were derived from the  so-called Strange Stories Task), so it’s perhaps not surprising improvements were shown in the intervention group. It would have been more impressive if the training had led to improvements in Theory of Mind that were tested in a different way. Finally, this study wasn’t able to show that there were any follow-on benefits from the apparent increases in Theory of Mind abilities enjoyed by the pupils who received the Theory of Mind intervention. If future research could show the training leads to tangible benefits to children’s relationships or schoolwork, for example, that would be very exciting.</p>

<blockquote><p>Obesity is one of the largest health concerns worldwide, with global obesity prevalence estimated to reach approximately 20% by 2025</p></blockquote>
<p>This epidemic has generated a lot of scientific interest in many disciplines including genetics, within which the Fat Mass and Obesity Associated (FTO) gene is the most investigated gene in obesity science because of its prevailing association with excess body mass, fat mass and BMI in clinical populations. The minor ‘risk’ version (A allele) of the gene is associated with elevations in parameters related to obesity (cardiovascular disease, higher BMI and body fat, etc.) and the more common version (T allele) is protective against these obesity-related health problems. Currently, we do not fully understand the mechanism behind the FTO association with these differences in obesity-related parameters, but it is likely that there are FTO-related inter-individual differences in appetite, dietary energy intake and thus greater accumulation of body fat. But what if there was something else happening in metabolically active tissues?</p>
<p>Little scientific attention has been devoted to studying the FTO gene and muscle characteristics in healthy individuals or individuals with especially high physiological function such as elite athletes – which might provide new insight into this obesity-related gene. This is what we did in our <a href="https://bmcgenet.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12863-017-0470-1"><em>BMC Genetics</em> article</a>.</p>
<figure class="wp-caption alignright" id="attachment_8434" style="width: 336px;"><img alt="12863_2017_470_Fig1_HTML" class="wp-image-8434 " height="344" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2017/01/12863_2017_470_Fig1_HTML-1.gif" width="326" /><div class="attachment-image--caption"><em>FTO genotype data of athletes and controls. a Recessive model.

Grey bars represent the T allele, black bars represent the A allele (Fig 1, Heffernan et al)<br /></em></div><div class="attachment-image--source"></div></figure>
<p>We firstly measured muscle phenotypes, including lean mass, in 120 healthy men and found the obesity-protective T allele was associated with greater whole body, arm and leg lean mass. This observation has implications for conditions such as sarcopenia and other muscle wasting disorders, and should be investigated with respect to possible genetic susceptibility or resistance to those conditions.</p>
<p>Following the FTO association with lean mass, utilizing a case-control study design, we investigated if FTO variation differed between elite rugby playing positions, specifically those where lean mass relative to total body mass is vital for elite success. As such, in a group of 530 elite rugby athletes and 566 controls (the RugbyGene project), our results show that indeed those elite athletes most reliant on lean mass relative to body mass (centers and back 3 players) have a greater frequency of the protective FTO T allele. In fact, those rugby union athletes with the ‘protective’ version of FTO have more than three times the odds of being a center or back 3 player than any other playing position. Furthermore, the risk A allele (associated with greater body mass) showed the highest frequency in those athletes that require greater body mass to achieve elite rugby status (forwards).</p>
<p>These results were further supported when we assessed lower body maximal power output in a subset of 77 elite rugby athletes, with the centers and back 3 players having the greatest relative (corrected for total body mass) power output. Collectively, these results indicate the importance of an inherent capacity to develop lean mass (in order to generate power) and that a greater genetic susceptibility to higher body mass is advantageous for elite rugby union forwards.</p>
<p>We have <a href="http://physiolgenomics.physiology.org/content/48/3/196">previously reported</a> that another genetic variant associated with muscle performance (the ACTN3 gene) also differs in allele frequency between elite rugby playing positions. Together with our current <em>BMC Genetics</em> paper, it is becoming clear that genetics plays a key role in elite rugby. As the RugbyGene project continues we expect to identify many more genetic variants that are important to rugby performance, physiology and injury risk, through both case-control and phenotype-association approaches.</p>

<p>Deep brain stimulation is a medical procedure that involves implanting electrodes permanently into the brain and using them to alter the functioning of specific neural networks. A battery inserted subcutaneously in the chest provides the device with power. One application of the technology is <a href="https://www.parkinsons.org.uk/content/deep-brain-stimulation-surgery-parkinsons">as a treatment for Parkinson’s Disease</a>, a neurodegenerative condition that causes tremors and difficulties moving. While the treatment can bring about an impressive alleviation of symptoms, research suggests that Parkinson’s patients often struggle to adjust psychologically. Now a <a href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/bjhp.12219/abstract">case study</a> published in the <em>British Journal of Health Psychology</em> has provided some of the first insights into what it’s like for a patient to contemplate undergoing surgery for deep brain stimulation, and then to adjust in the immediate aftermath.</p>
<p><span id="more-17804"></span></p>
<p>Psychologist Virginia Eatough at Birkbeck University of London and her colleague, nurse specialist Karen Shaw from UCL’s Institute of Neurology, interviewed Katherine (not her real name), a 72-year-old Parkinson’s patient, three times: three weeks prior to surgery for deep brain stimulation, then four and twelve weeks afterwards. After transcribing the interviews, the researchers identified three main themes, the first concerned how she made the decision to go ahead with the surgery after the idea was proposed to her by her consultant.</p>
<p>Understandably, Katherine was scared of the procedure. But while she was encouraged by medical staff to speak to her friends and family, she found that they were so worried that she kept her own concerns to herself. “Most people’s reaction has been one of slight horror,” she said, “so I’ve been spending my time reassuring them…”.</p>
<p>Katherine also said how she’d been provided with a lot of facts about the intervention by medical staff, but that what she really wanted was a human form of reassurance. “I was looking for confidence [from my consultant],” she said, “and he didn’t give it. He didn’t not give it but he didn’t give it”. Katherine also said repeatedly that she would have liked to speak to other patients who’d gone through the procedure, but that this wasn’t an option.</p>
<p>In the end, after being impressed by the warmth of surgeon she decided to go ahead with the surgery, in the hope of a breaking through the “dead end” she’d reached with her worsening illness.</p>
<p>The second theme was Katherine’s shifting emotions through the period before and after the operation. She spoke of her fear of her Parkinson’s “engulfing her”, but also her trepidation at the procedure. As it grew imminent, her fear gave way to relief and excitement. “I stopped feeling apprehensive, I sort of gave up, I decided to just let it go,” she said.</p>
<p>Then immediately after the surgery, not detecting any noticeable improvement in her symptoms, Katherine went through a phase of feeling feelings of failure, disappointment and anger. “I felt I’d failed,” she said, “the fact that I wasn’t immediately dramatically different made me feel I’d failed, I had a huge sense of failure.”</p>
<p>But eventually, after returning home, Katherine became more aware of her improvements, and she realised that her doctors, who were pleased with the outcome, hadn’t just been feigning their satisfaction with the outcomes. This realisation made her feel overjoyed, grateful and happy. At the same time, however, she began to feel “slightly cast adrift” and “frightened” at the lack of continuing support.</p>
<p>“The procedure had given rise to considerable emotional fragility,” the researchers said, “indicating the need for psychological support at all stages.”</p>
<p>The final theme concerned “the embodied meaning” of the procedure. Katherine saw it as “odd”, “spectacular” and “strange”, the stuff of fiction. “I’m worried about getting water in the holds in my head,” she said. “I felt my brain had been taken over and God knows what thoughts had been put in it and would I ever be in control of it again and would I know how to handle by new brain?”.</p>
<p>Later she began to adjust. “I try not to think about it,” she said. “… You could go fairly crazy trying to think about having sticks in your head, but then I’ve got two artificial hips and an artificial knee so why am I not worrying about that, it’s the same intrusion and it’s artificial.”</p>
<p>The researchers said their case study showed how the deep brain stimulation experience is “one of considerable emotional and cognitive turmoil”, indicating the importance of “patient tailored discussion, counselling and emotional support”. One practical suggestion they had is for the introduction of a buddy system in which prospective patients are paired with a patient who has already undertaken the procedure. The researchers also emphasised that the interviews demonstrated the need for medical professionals to go beyond providing factual advice. They need to “step outside of their professional role, no matter how briefly, and see how it looks from the perspective of someone like Katherine.”</p>

            <p>Confidence is an attractive and necessary quality to succeed in business, relationships, and life. But, it is a subjective and, sometimes, misunderstood characteristic. From the painfully shy to the arrogantly over-confident, what makes people think and feel what they think and feel about themselves? The authors of a new study report that they have uncovered brain activity patterns that are associated with confidence. And, what’s more, they say that people can be trained to have more confidence.</p>
<p>The new study, published in <em>Nature Communications</em>, used imaging techniques and a method of neural activation called decoded neurofeedback to analyze the brain activity patterns of 17 young-adult participants. The participants engaged in simple perceptual and behavioral exercises that allowed the team of researchers to identify low-confidence and high-confidence brain activity patterns. Next, the participants were given a small monetary reward every time the researchers detected a high-confidence state. The participants also rated their own levels of confidence after the tasks. In the end, the participants unconsciously raised their levels of confidence, in real time, even though they were unaware of the manipulation.</p>
<p>Self-confidence is generally a belief in one’s own abilities. It is a complex internal, emotional state—influenced by myriad factors—that describes how we feel about ourselves. A lack of self-confidence can lead to shyness, social anxiety, lack of assertiveness, communication difficulties, and mental health problems. These factors can, in turn, negatively impact activity levels, relationships, and careers.</p>
<p>To date, self-confidence has been primarily assessed through introspection and self-reports. However, recently, the deeply subjective nature of self-confidence has been examined as an objective quality. Through functional imaging techniques, scientists are beginning to develop neural models for the feelings of confidence, and these new findings have important implications for psychiatry and psychology, as well as understandings of behavior and decision-making.</p>
<p>Self-confidence does not look or feel the same for all people, and, regardless of objective measures of brain activity, it will continue to be an individualized phenomenon, for the most part. The new study does not leave readers with any self-help steps that can be used to improve self-confidence outside of a laboratory setting, but it does support the perspective that self-confidence is flexible and fluid. The finding that self-confidence can be changed by training one’s brain may bring the scientific world one step closer to understanding just how and why certain mental states exist—and, what can be done to change them.</p>

<p><i><b></b></i><strong>Editorial</strong></p>
<p>This month, I have selected 4 papers on spike initiation (1-4), 1 classical paper on the theory of brain energetics (5), and 1 paper on bibliometrics (6). Three of the papers on spike initiation (1-3) have in common that they are about the relation between geometry (morphology of the neuron and spatial distribution of channels) and excitability. Spikes are initiated in a small region called the axon initial segment (AIS), and this region is very close to the soma. Thus there is a discontinuity in both the geometry (big soma, thin axon) and the spatial distribution of channels (lots in the AIS). It has great impact on excitability, but this has not been very deeply explored theoretically. In fact, as I have discussed in a recent review (<a href="http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article/file?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1004114&amp;type=printable">Brette, 2015</a>), most theory on excitability (dynamical systems theory) has been developed on isopotential models, and so is largely obsolete. So there is much to do on spike initiation theory that takes into account the soma-AIS system.</p>

<p>A number of studies have shown that the AIS can move over hours or days, with various manipulations such as depolarizing the neuron (as in this study) or stimulating it optogenetically. Two open questions: what are the molecular mechanisms involved in this displacement? Is it actually a displacement or is it just that stuff is removed at one end and inserted at the other end? The same lab previously addressed the first question, showing the involvement of somatic L-type calcium channels and calmodulin. This study shows that myosin (the stuff of muscle, except not the type expressed in muscles) is involved, which strongly suggests that it is an actual displacement; this is in line with previous studies showing that dendrites and axons are contractile structures (e.g. <a href="https://elifesciences.org/content/3/e03159">Roland et al. (2014)</a>). This and previous studies start to provide building blocks for a model of activity-dependent structural plasticity of the AIS (working on it!).</p>

<p>Full disclosure: I am an author of this paper. In the lab, we are currently interested in the relation between neural geometry and excitability. In particular, what is the electrical impact of the location of the axon initial segment (AIS)? Experimentally, this is a difficult question because manipulations of AIS geometry (distance, length) also induce changes in Nav channel and other channel properties, in particular phosphorylation (<a href="https://kclpure.kcl.ac.uk/portal/files/54487324/Rapid_Modulation_of_Axon_EVANS_Accepted_22Sept2015_GOLD_VoR.pdf">Evans et al., 2015</a>). So this is typically a good question for theorists. I have previously shown that moving the AIS away from the soma should make the neuron more excitable (lower spike threshold), everything else being equal (<a href="http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article/file?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003338&amp;type=printable">Brette, 2013</a>). Here we look at what happens after axonal spike initiation, when the current enters the soma (I try to avoid the term “backpropagate”, see <a href="http://biorxiv.org/content/biorxiv/early/2016/04/14/037549.full.pdf">Telenczuk et al., 2016</a>). The basic insight is simple: when the axonal spike is fully developed, the voltage gradient between soma and start of the AIS should be roughly 100 mV, and so the axonal current into the soma should be roughly 100 mV divided by resistance between soma and AIS, which is proportional to AIS distance. Next, to charge a big somatodendritic compartment, you need a bigger current. So we predict that big neurons should have a more proximal AIS. This is what the data obtained by Kole’s lab show in this paper (along with many other things, as our theoretical work is a small part of the paper – as often, most of the theory ends up in the <a href="http://www.pnas.org/content/suppl/2016/11/30/1607548113.DCSupplemental/pnas.201607548SI.pdf">supplementary</a>).</p>

<p>Using simulations of detailed models, the authors propose to explain the observation of spikelets in vivo (small all-or-none events) by the failed propagation of axonal spikes to the soma. Under certain circumstances, they show that a spike generated at the distal axonal initiation site may fail to reach the somatic threshold for AP generation, so that only the smaller axonal spike is observed at the soma. This paper provides a nice overview of the topic and I found the study convincing. There is in fact a direct relation to our paper discussed above (<a href="http://www.pnas.org/content/113/51/14841.full.pdf?with-ds=yes">Hamada et al., 2016</a>): this study shows how the axonal spike can fail to trigger the somatic spike, which explains why the AIS needs to be placed at the right position to prevent this. One can argue (speculatively) that if AIS position is indeed tuned to produce the right amount of somatic depolarization, then sometimes this should fail and result in a spikelet (algorithm: if no spikelet, move AIS distally; if spikelet, move AIS proximally).</p>

<p>I had to love this paper, because the authors basically experimentally confirm every theoretical prediction we had made in our paper on spike threshold adaptation (<a href="http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article/file?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1001129&amp;type=printable">Platkiewicz and Brette, 2011</a>). Essentially, what we had done is derive the dynamics of spike threshold from the dynamics of Nav channel inactivation. There were a number of non-trivial predictions, such as the shortening of the effective integration time constant, sensitivity to input variance, the specific way in which spike threshold depends on membrane potential, and the interaction between spike-triggered and subthreshold adaptation (that we touched upon in the discussion). This study uses a non-parametric model-fitting approach in cortical slices to empirically derive the dynamics of spike threshold (indirectly, based on responses to fluctuating currents), and the results are completely in line with our theoretical predictions.</p>

<p>This is an old but important paper on energetics of the brain, in particular: how much does it cost to maintain the resting potential? How much does it cost to propagate a spike? The paper explains some theoretical ideas to do these estimations, and is also a good source for relevant empirical numbers. It is important though to look at follow-up studies, which have addressed some issues, for example action potential efficiency is underestimated in this study. One problem in this study is the estimation of the cost of the resting potential, which I think is just wrong (<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11598490#cm11598490_49684">see my detailed comment</a> on Pubmed Commons; I believe the authors will soon respond). Unfortunately, I think it is really hard to estimate this cost by theoretical means; it would require knowing the permeability at rest to various ions, most importantly in the axon.</p>

<p><em>6. Brembs B, Button K and M Munafò (2013). <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1301.3748.pdf">Deep Impact: Unintended consequences of journal rank</a>. (Comment on <a href="http://10.3389/fnhum.2013.00291">PubPeer</a>)</em></p>
<p>The authors look at the relation between journal rank (derived from impact factor) and various indicators, for example effect sizes reported, statistical power, etc. In summary, they found that the only thing journal rank strongly correlates with is the proportion of retractions and frauds. Another interesting finding is about the predictive power of journal rank on future citations. There is obviously a positive correlation since impact factor measures the number of citations. But it is really quite small (see my <a href="http://romainbrette.fr/you-are-not-a-good-scientist-if-you-use-impact-factors-for-evaluating-research/">post on this</a>). What is most interesting is that the predictive power started increasing in the 1960s, when the impact factor was introduced. This strongly suggests that, rather than being a quality indicator, the impact factor biases the citations of papers (increases the visibility of otherwise equally good papers). This paper also shows evidence of manipulation of impact factors by journals (including Current Biology, whose impact factor went from 7 to 12 after its acquisition by Elsevier), and is generally a good source of references on the subject.</p>

To avoid falling down, you integrate multiple sources of information: visual motion of objects gives information about the velocity of your head, while proprioceptive input from the neck joint gives information about the head’s position relative to the body. Pressure sensations from the footpads and muscle activity in the lower limbs reflect lower body leaning. The loss of any these inputs — for example, closing your eyes — means you’re much more likely to fall down.</p>

<p>In this post, we’ll explore what happens when people lost perhaps the most important contributor to the sense of equilibrium: the vestibule. <span id="more-6503"></span>The vestibular apparatus is a sensory organ located in the inner ear. It consists of the semicircular canals, which measure angular acceleration, and the saccule and utricule, which measure linear acceleration and gravity. Together, they relay information about the head’s orientation in space, much like the gyros and accelerometers in a smartphone measure the device’s tilt.</p>

<p>When the head turns rapidly, the liquid in the 3 semi-circular canals stays in place due to its inertia, then slowly catches up, triggering hair cells within the ampulae of the canals. That leads to a rapid increase in firing rate in the vestibular nerve, which relays this information to the brain stem and cerebellum.</p>

<h1>Wobblers</h1>
<p>The first chapter of Doidge (2007) tells the fascinating story of people with bilateral vestibular damage (BVD). People with BVD sometimes call themselves <i>wobblers</i>: they can have normal equilibrium as long as their eyes are open and all motions are performed slowly. But when moving rapidly or when their eyes are closed, equilibrium is lost, resulting in a characteristic wobbly gait.</p>
<p></p><figure class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_6526" style="width: 637px;"><img alt="OLYMPUS DIGITAL CAMERA" class=" size-full wp-image-6526 aligncenter" src="https://xcorr.files.wordpress.com/2017/01/4.jpg?w=748" />&lt;figcaption class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Streptomycin ototoxicity [<a href="http://otopathologynetwork.org/tbimages/chapter6/image004/">Source</a>]&lt;/figcaption&gt;</figure>BVD is most often due to hair cell damage caused by ototoxic drugs. The aminoglycoside family of antibiotics in particular is associated with BVD (Roland 2003), which results in catastrophic loss of equilibrium. Gentamicin is the most frequent culprit, while amikacin and streptomycin can also damage both vestibular and cochlear cells. Balance can be affected in up to 15% of patients taking gentamicin (Fausti 1999, Fee 1980).<p></p>
<p>Equilibrium in people with BVD can be treated with <i>sensory substitution</i>, relaying information equivalent to that of the vestibule through another sense, and letting the brain’s plasticity take care of integrating the new information seamlessly. Doidge (2007) talks about a particular form of sensory substitution for people with BVD: <i>BrainPort</i>.</p>
<h1>Sensory substitution for people with BVD</h1>
<p>BrainPort came from a long line of development into sensory substitution for people suffering from blindness. In the early 70’s, the neuroscientist Paul Bach y Rita experimented with relaying visual information to blind people through their intact senses. He first built a chair with several actuators that could vibrate at multiple points on a person’s back. He connected a film camera to the actuators, relaying brightness information via vibration, and demonstrated basic recognition — blind people could identify the the orientation of lines and recognize large familiar objects after some experience with the chair.</p>
<p></p><figure class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_6538" style="width: 310px;"><img alt="1421_sensory_homunculus" class=" size-medium wp-image-6538 aligncenter" height="299" src="https://xcorr.files.wordpress.com/2017/01/1421_sensory_homunculus.jpg?w=300&amp;h=299" width="300" />&lt;figcaption class="wp-caption-text"&gt;The somatosensory homunculus, by OpenStax College – Anatomy, Physiology, Connexions website, <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0">CC BY 3.0</a> [<a href="http://cnx.org/content/col11496/1.6/">Source</a>]&lt;/figcaption&gt;</figure>Back-based systems are bulky; an ideal, miniaturized system would stimulate an area of a person’s body with a high density of touch receptors. As you can judge from the shape of the somatosensory homunculus, the tongue is highly over-represented in the brain, and it contains a very high number of touch receptors compared to its size. Furthermore, it comes with its own saline solution, saliva — it’s thus ideally suited to be directly stimulated through electric impulses with a miniature device. Thus was born BrainPort, a sensory substitution device which can relay  visual information to a blind person though the tongue.<p></p>
<p></p><figure class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_6545" style="width: 235px;"><img alt="screenshot-from-2017-01-23-215359" class=" size-full wp-image-6545 aligncenter" src="https://xcorr.files.wordpress.com/2017/01/screenshot-from-2017-01-23-215359.png?w=748" />&lt;figcaption class="wp-caption-text"&gt;A blind user about to bite into BrainPort [<a href="http://www.wicab.com/brainport-v100">Source</a>]&lt;/figcaption&gt;</figure>When Bach y Rita encountered people with BVD several years later, in the 2000s, he had a device on hand that he knew could help them — BrainPort. He attached a gyro to a plastic hard hat, filtered that information minimally, and relayed the information through BrainPort. When the patient tilted their head to the right, they got a jolt on the right side of the tongue; when they tilted their head forward, they felt a jolt at the front of the tongue, and so forth.<p></p>
<figure class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_6551" style="width: 622px;"><img alt="screenshot-from-2017-01-23-215917" class=" size-full wp-image-6551 aligncenter" src="https://xcorr.files.wordpress.com/2017/01/screenshot-from-2017-01-23-215917.png?w=748" />&lt;figcaption class="wp-caption-text"&gt;As measured by an accelerometer, people with BVD experience large sway over time (y axis in degrees; middle plot). With vestibular substitution, they see a large decrease in sway (bottom plot)&lt;/figcaption&gt;</figure>
<p>When the device was turned on, he saw an immediate and profound decrease in oscillatory movement in people with BVD. The mapping between vestibular and somatosensory information was sufficiently simple that very little training with the device was necessary.</p>
<h1>Long-term effects of sensory substitution</h1>
<p>Perhaps most intriguing is that after several months of training with the device, oscillatory movements decreased <i>when the device was off</i>. At first, improved equilibrium persisted for a few minutes after turning the device off; after having trained with the device for an hour a day for a few months, however, the improvement persisted first for a few hours, and then for a few days, and eventually where the improvement became persistent.</p>
<p>That might seem a little magical, but it seems to be driven by long-term plasticity. We know that following vestibular deinnervation, there’s behavioural compensation after an initial period of complete loss of equilibrium; subjects learn to compensate through proprioception, somatosensation, vision, and efference copy. Furthermore, what drives this compensation is plasticity, with multi-sensory neurons increasing their sensitivity to non-vestibular signal (Sadeghi et al. 2012).</p>
<p>To optimally fuse the information from several noisy sensors, more reliable signals should be integrated with a higher weight. BrainPort’s stickiness might work by giving the brain a reference signal against which it can measure the accuracy of other equilibrium sensors. Indeed, we know that single neurons in the parietal cortex perform this type of Bayesian sensor fusion (Fetsch et al. 2012), and might reweight the signals through plasticity using BrainPort as reference.</p>
<p>BrainPort could lead to long-term improvement in equilibrium by a second mechanism: by recalibrating the residual vestibular input. Not every hair cell dies after BVD; there’s residual signal, perhaps 2-5% of the original signal strength, that comes through the vestibular nerve.</p>
<figure class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_6574" style="width: 970px;"><img alt="1714-06" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-6574" src="https://xcorr.files.wordpress.com/2017/01/1714-06.jpg?w=748" />&lt;figcaption class="wp-caption-text"&gt;An accelerometer, a gyro and a magnetometer on a breakout board from <a href="https://www.adafruit.com/product/1714">Adafruit</a>. With some Kalman filtering, the gyroscope can use the accelerometer as its reference to prevent drift.&lt;/figcaption&gt;</figure>
<p>The signals measured by the semi-circular canal are proportional to angular acceleration and jerk. To infer the head’s tilt, the signals must be integrated twice, which makes them vulnerable to drift. A small systematic error in the acceleration signal, due to an incorrect calibration, gets integrated over time, and eventually blows up to a large error. The brain now thinks the head is an entirely different position that it actually is.</p>
<p>Drift is not just a problem for the vestibule, it’s a general problem in angular accelerometers — it also afflicts solid-state gyros. To avoid this problem, in the vestibule as in electronics, angular acceleration must be integrated with another signal that doesn’t suffer from drift — linear acceleration. Unfortunately, BVD also affects the parts of the vestibule that respond to linear acceleration — the utricule and saccule. The external signal from Brainport can serve as a reference signal against which to calibrate all of these signals, decreasing drift over months of plasticity.</p>
<h1>Practical sensory substitution methods</h1>
<p>As impressive as BrainPort is for patients with BVD, this form of therapy hasn’t moved much beyond stage I clinical trials. The main reason Brainport hasn’t taken off is that walking around with a piece of electronic in one’s mouth looks silly, and makes talking difficult. The most commonly used therapy these days uses sensory stimulation via <a href="http://www.sensorykinetics.com/index.php/products/parentsubmenu">a belt with integrated haptics and balance board system</a>.</p>
<div class="jetpack-video-wrapper">&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/CoZ3nHXArxQ?version=3&amp;amp;rel=1&amp;amp;fs=1&amp;amp;autohide=2&amp;amp;showsearch=0&amp;amp;showinfo=1&amp;amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;amp;wmode=transparent" style="border:0;" height="451" width="748" allowfullscreen="true" type="text/html" class="youtube-player"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;</div>
<p>These systems are, however, bulky and expensive. Because gentamicin is on the WHO list of essential medications, it’s available pretty much everywhere, including in rural hospitals in developing countries; that’s thousands of new people with BVD in developing countries every year.</p>
<p>Dr. Marissé Masis-Solano and I thus embarked on building a vestibular replacement system based on open-source electronics. Our goal was to make a system that would be easy to build for under a 100$. An IMU installed on the head would record its position, it would be beamed to a receiver device, and communicated via haptic motors installed in the palm. In the next few installments, we’ll show you how we’re building our solution.</p>

<p>A tough interview or critical match can generate such anxiety that it ends up sabotaging our hopes and fulfilling our fears. People adopt different ploys to drive it away, from meditating to enjoying a cigarette. But it’s another tactic at the centre of <a href="http://www.hbs.edu/faculty/Pages/item.aspx?num=51401">new research</a> published in <em>Organizational Behavior and Human Decision Processes</em>: the power of ritual. Many top-level performers use ritual to prepare for their game or show, whether this be chewing on <a href="http://www.mensjournal.com/expert-advice/10-habits-of-highly-successful-athletes-20131203/brian-urlacher">exactly two cookies</a> or <a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/music/features/leonard-cohen-before-the-gig-a-chant-in-latin-8104872.html">chanting Latin</a> – and the new research suggests many of the rest of us do too, with around half of a surveyed sample of participants admitting to trying it at least once. But is there a point to it?</p>
<p>The research, led by Harvard Business School’s Alison Woods Brooks, suggests there is. In a pair of studies, 250 participants had to cope with the pressure of having to sing part of a song to a stranger, the Journey “classic” <em>Don’t Stop Believing</em>. Just before they put their voice on show, participants in one condition were asked to conduct a short ritual: draw a picture of their feelings, sprinkle salt on it, recite a countdown aloud before throwing the paper in the trash.</p>
<p><span id="more-17783"></span></p>
<p>Using a pulse tracker to measure the participants’ heart rate, the researchers found that assigning them the singing task set their hearts racing. But they also found that practicing the ritual, compared to doing nothing, dropped participants’ heart rate down towards normal levels. Self-reported anxiety was also reduced, and ritual users produced singing of a higher quality in terms of pitch, volume and note duration. They didn’t just feel better; they performed better, too.</p>
<p>The next study asked whether ritual is effective in any challenging situation, or specifically in anxiety-provoking contexts. Participants all attempted the same set of maths problems, but the researchers told some of them they were “fun maths puzzles”, while telling others it was “a very difficult IQ test”; only the second group showed improved performance after completing a ritual beforehand, suggesting that anxiety alleviation is key.</p>
<p>How do rituals calm us down? Maybe it’s the chance to express oneself emotionally, known to be an effective method of reducing anxiety. But the definition of ritual used by Brooks – fixed routines with symbolic significance – doesn’t require any self-expression. And a neutral procedure – writing down a fixed sequence of numbers – turned out to work just as well in improving performance. However, when participants were told this procedure was just “a few random behaviours” it was less effective than when it was explicitly labelled as a ritual, confirming that the symbolic significance is an important component of the effect.</p>
<p>Small studies on “pre-performance routines” have been published in the past but their focus included more obviously functional practices, such as stretches and concentration exercises. This new work shows the specific benefits owing to ritual: the millennia-old cultural practice used to cope with the hunt, birth, and death. More modern anxiety management techniques such as expressive writing or CBT’s emotional appraisal are familiar parts of the psychologist’s toolkit, and may appear as overdue replacements for the methods of the past. But as Brooks and her colleagues conclude, “although some may dismiss rituals as irrational, those who enact rituals may well outperform the skeptics who forgo them.”</p>

 Islet transplantation is an established therapy for diabetes. We have previously shown that rat pancreata can be created from rat pluripotent stem cells (PSCs) in mice through interspecies blastocyst complementation. Although they were functional and composed of rat-derived cells, the resulting pancreata were of mouse size, rendering them insufficient for isolating the numbers of islets required to treat diabetes in a rat model. Here, by performing the reverse experiment, injecting mouse PSCs into Pdx-1-deficient rat blastocysts, we generated rat-sized pancreata composed of mouse-PSC-derived cells. Islets subsequently prepared from these mouse–rat chimaeric pancreata were transplanted into mice with streptozotocin-induced diabetes. The transplanted islets successfully normalized and maintained host blood glucose levels for over 370 days in the absence of immunosuppression (excluding the first 5 days after transplant). These data provide proof-of-principle evidence for the therapeutic potential of PSC-derived islets generated by blastocyst complementation in a xenogeneic host.

 The genomes of individuals with severe, undiagnosed developmental disorders are enriched in damaging de novo mutations (DNMs) in developmentally important genes. Here we have sequenced the exomes of 4,293 families containing individuals with developmental disorders, and meta-analysed these data with data from another 3,287 individuals with similar disorders. We show that the most important factors influencing the diagnostic yield of DNMs are the sex of the affected individual, the relatedness of their parents, whether close relatives are affected and the parental ages. We identified 94 genes enriched in damaging DNMs, including 14 that previously lacked compelling evidence of involvement in developmental disorders. We have also characterized the phenotypic diversity among these disorders. We estimate that 42% of our cohort carry pathogenic DNMs in coding sequences; approximately half of these DNMs disrupt gene function and the remainder result in altered protein function. We estimate that developmental disorders caused by DNMs have an average prevalence of 1 in 213 to 1 in 448 births, depending on parental age. Given current global demographics, this equates to almost 400,000 children born per year.

 Skin cancer, the most common human malignancy, is primarily diagnosed visually, beginning with an initial clinical screening and followed potentially by dermoscopic analysis, a biopsy and histopathological examination. Automated classification of skin lesions using images is a challenging task owing to the fine-grained variability in the appearance of skin lesions. Deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) show potential for general and highly variable tasks across many fine-grained object categories. Here we demonstrate classification of skin lesions using a single CNN, trained end-to-end from images directly, using only pixels and disease labels as inputs. We train a CNN using a dataset of 129,450 clinical images—two orders of magnitude larger than previous datasets—consisting of 2,032 different diseases. We test its performance against 21 board-certified dermatologists on biopsy-proven clinical images with two critical binary classification use cases: keratinocyte carcinomas versus benign seborrheic keratoses; and malignant melanomas versus benign nevi. The first case represents the identification of the most common cancers, the second represents the identification of the deadliest skin cancer. The CNN achieves performance on par with all tested experts across both tasks, demonstrating an artificial intelligence capable of classifying skin cancer with a level of competence comparable to dermatologists. Outfitted with deep neural networks, mobile devices can potentially extend the reach of dermatologists outside of the clinic. It is projected that 6.3 billion smartphone subscriptions will exist by the year 2021 (ref. 13) and can therefore potentially provide low-cost universal access to vital diagnostic care.

 Once considered provocative, the notion that the wisdom of the crowd is superior to any individual has become itself a piece of crowd wisdom, leading to speculation that online voting may soon put credentialed experts out of business. Recent applications include political and economic forecasting, evaluating nuclear safety, public policy, the quality of chemical probes, and possible responses to a restless volcano. Algorithms for extracting wisdom from the crowd are typically based on a democratic voting procedure. They are simple to apply and preserve the independence of personal judgment. However, democratic methods have serious limitations. They are biased for shallow, lowest common denominator information, at the expense of novel or specialized knowledge that is not widely shared. Adjustments based on measuring confidence do not solve this problem reliably. Here we propose the following alternative to a democratic vote: select the answer that is more popular than people predict. We show that this principle yields the best answer under reasonable assumptions about voter behaviour, while the standard ‘most popular’ or ‘most confident’ principles fail under exactly those same assumptions. Like traditional voting, the principle accepts unique problems, such as panel decisions about scientific or artistic merit, and legal or historical disputes. The potential application domain is thus broader than that covered by machine learning and psychometric methods, which require data across multiple questions.

 When faced with threat, the survival of an organism is contingent upon the selection of appropriate active or passive behavioural responses. Freezing is an evolutionarily conserved passive fear response that has been used extensively to study the neuronal mechanisms of fear and fear conditioning in rodents. However, rodents also exhibit active responses such as flight under natural conditions. The central amygdala (CEA) is a forebrain structure vital for the acquisition and expression of conditioned fear responses, and the role of specific neuronal sub-populations of the CEA in freezing behaviour is well-established. Whether the CEA is also involved in flight behaviour, and how neuronal circuits for active and passive fear behaviour interact within the CEA, are not yet understood. Here, using in vivo optogenetics and extracellular recordings of identified cell types in a behavioural model in which mice switch between conditioned freezing and flight, we show that active and passive fear responses are mediated by distinct and mutually inhibitory CEA neurons. Cells expressing corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF+) mediate conditioned flight, and activation of somatostatin-positive (SOM+) neurons initiates passive freezing behaviour. Moreover, we find that the balance between conditioned flight and freezing behaviour is regulated by means of local inhibitory connections between CRF+ and SOM+ neurons, indicating that the selection of appropriate behavioural responses to threat is based on competitive interactions between two defined populations of inhibitory neurons, a circuit motif allowing for rapid and flexible action selection.

            <p>Elucidation of the evolutionary history and interrelatedness of Plasmodium species that infect humans has been hampered by a lack of genetic information for three human-infective species: P. malariae and two P. ovale species (P. o. curtisi and P. o. wallikeri). These species are prevalent across most regions in which malaria is endemic and are often undetectable by light microscopy, rendering their study in human populations difficult. The exact evolutionary relationship of these species to the other human-infective species has been contested. Using a new reference genome for P. malariae and a manually curated draft P. o. curtisi genome, we are now able to accurately place these species within the Plasmodium phylogeny. Sequencing of a P. malariae relative that infects chimpanzees reveals similar signatures of selection in the P. malariae lineage to another Plasmodium lineage shown to be capable of colonization of both human and chimpanzee hosts. Molecular dating suggests that these host adaptations occurred over similar evolutionary timescales. In addition to the core genome that is conserved between species, differences in gene content can be linked to their specific biology. The genome suggests that P. malariae expresses a family of heterodimeric proteins on its surface that have structural similarities to a protein crucial for invasion of red blood cells. The data presented here provide insight into the evolution of the Plasmodium genus as a whole.</p><p>Nature   <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/nature21038">doi: 10.1038/nature21038</a></p><img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/NatureBiologicalSciencesResearch/~4/PsVHgW3g-6A" width="1" />

 Integrins are adhesion receptors that transmit force across the plasma membrane between extracellular ligands and the actin cytoskeleton. In activation of the transforming growth factor-β1 precursor (pro-TGF-β1), integrins bind to the prodomain, apply force, and release the TGF-β growth factor. However, we know little about how integrins bind macromolecular ligands in the extracellular matrix or transmit force to them. Here we show how integrin αVβ6 binds pro-TGF-β1 in an orientation biologically relevant for force-dependent release of TGF-β from latency. The conformation of the prodomain integrin-binding motif differs in the presence and absence of integrin binding; differences extend well outside the interface and illustrate how integrins can remodel extracellular matrix. Remodelled residues outside the interface stabilize the integrin-bound conformation, adopt a conformation similar to earlier-evolving family members, and show how macromolecular components outside the binding motif contribute to integrin recognition. Regions in and outside the highly interdigitated interface stabilize a specific integrin/pro-TGF-β orientation that defines the pathway through these macromolecules which actin-cytoskeleton-generated tensile force takes when applied through the integrin β-subunit. Simulations of force-dependent activation of TGF-β demonstrate evolutionary specializations for force application through the TGF-β prodomain and through the β- and not α-subunit of the integrin.

            <p>Temperature is a primary driver of the distribution of biodiversity as well as of ecosystem boundaries. Declining temperature with increasing elevation in montane systems has long been recognized as a major factor shaping plant community biodiversity, metabolic processes, and ecosystem dynamics. Elevational gradients, as thermoclines, also enable prediction of long-term ecological responses to climate warming. One of the most striking manifestations of increasing elevation is the abrupt transitions from forest to treeless alpine tundra. However, whether there are globally consistent above- and belowground responses to these transitions remains an open question. To disentangle the direct and indirect effects of temperature on ecosystem properties, here we evaluate replicate treeline ecotones in seven temperate regions of the world. We find that declining temperatures with increasing elevation did not affect tree leaf nutrient concentrations, but did reduce ground-layer community-weighted plant nitrogen, leading to the strong stoichiometric convergence of ground-layer plant community nitrogen to phosphorus ratios across all regions. Further, elevation-driven changes in plant nutrients were associated with changes in soil organic matter content and quality (carbon to nitrogen ratios) and microbial properties. Combined, our identification of direct and indirect temperature controls over plant communities and soil properties in seven contrasting regions suggests that future warming may disrupt the functional properties of montane ecosystems, particularly where plant community reorganization outpaces treeline advance.</p><p>Nature   <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/nature21027">doi: 10.1038/nature21027</a></p><img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/NatureBiologicalSciencesResearch/~4/pHyef4G9NKg" width="1" />

<p>When all around us feels like chaos, it’s human instinct to cling to the rocks of dogma, and woe betide anyone who tries to loosen our grip. Previous studies, usually involving strong religious believers, have shown how dogmatic beliefs allay the anxiety brought on by feelings of uncertainty. In turn, any groups with opposing views are treated with suspicion and prejudice. A <a href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/bjop.12186/abstract?campaign=woletoc">new study</a> in the <em>British Journal of Psychology</em> broadens this out, showing these processes aren’t unique to religious believers. Dogmatic atheists too seem to be motivated by the need to cope with uncertainty, and they too are prejudiced towards threatening groups, especially during times of uncertainty. The researchers at Jagiellonian University, led by Małgorzata Kossowska, suggest their findings have interesting implications for understanding political orientations and prejudices. The world feels especially unpredictable right now. Are we all, whatever our politics, clinging to our rocks more strongly than ever?</p>
<p><span id="more-17682"></span></p>
<p>Kossowska and her colleagues tested levels of dogmatic belief, whether religious or atheist, and intolerance of uncertainty, among 201 participants. They found that an inability to cope with uncertainty (as measured with the <a href="http://nymag.com/scienceofus/2015/12/this-quiz-shows-how-well-you-handle-uncertainty.html">Need for Closure scale</a>) correlated with dogmatic belief among religious people – Christians in this cultural context – but also with dogmatic belief among atheists. The researchers said this pattern suggests that, whatever your own religious or non-religious orientation, “dogmatic beliefs offer a global worldview full or rules and explanations and thereby reduce the complexity of life and create a psychologically safe and predictable environment.”</p>
<p>Next, the researchers tested the religious and atheistic beliefs and intolerance of 116 more participants, but this time they also manipulated some of them to experience feelings of uncertainty (participants rated their agreement with statements about times they’d felt uncertain, under the guise of it being a personality test). The researchers also tested their prejudice towards different social groups.</p>
<p>As before, a dislike of uncertainty correlated with dogmatic beliefs, both religious and atheist. More dogma also correlated with greater prejudice towards out-groups and seeing them as more threatening. Moreover, dogmatic believers of both stripes showed increased prejudice when primed to experience feelings of uncertainty. For the orthodox Christian believers, this manifested in increased prejudice towards homosexual people; for the dogmatic atheists, it was increased prejudice towards pro-life supporters.</p>
<p>The defence mechanism of dogmatic belief has in the past been seen as a feature of the religious and politically conservative. Kossowska and her team argue their findings suggest that uncertainty-fuelled dogma, and prejudice towards those who threaten that dogma, is a more universal phenomenon. “Prejudice is not limited only to religious believers or to those on the political right, but rather, as a response to uncertainty it may also occur among dogmatic atheists and the otherwise politically and socially liberal,” the researchers said.</p>

            <p>I present a novel (well, in 2009 it was) modular, stochastic model for biological template-based linear chain elongation processes. In this model, elongation complexes (eg DNA polymerase, RNA polymerase, or ribosomes associated with nascent chains) that span a finite number of template units step along the template, one after another, with semaphore constructs preventing overtaking. The central elongation module is readily extended with modules that represent initiation and termination processes. The model was used to explore the effect of elongation complex span on motor velocity and dispersion, and the effect of initiation activator and repressor binding kinetics on the overall elongation dynamics. The results demonstrate that (1) motors that move smoothly are able to travel at a greater velocity and closer together than motors that move more erratically, and (2) the rate at which completed chains are released is proportional to the occupancy or vacancy of activator or repressor binding sites only when initiation or activator/repressor dissociation is slow in comparison with elongation. If you think the above is a load of old hokum, do come to the talk for some more!</p>

<p>It’s a common belief that to make optimal decisions we need to be more logical and less emotional, rather like Mr Spock in Star Trek. In fact, much evidence argues against this. Consider the behaviour of patients whose brain damage has made them unusually cold and logical. Rather than this helping them make decisions, they often seem paralysed by indecision.</p>
<p>These patients, who usually have damage to parts of their frontal cortex, also tend to perform poorly on a game that’s used by psychologists to measure risk-taking behaviour: the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iowa_gambling_task">Iowa Gambling Task</a>. The neurologist and author Antonio Damasio thinks this is because they have lost the ability to incorporate gut instincts – literally, their visceral reactions – into their decision-making, an idea that forms the basis of his <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Somatic_marker_hypothesis">Somatic Marker Hypothesis</a>. This hypothesis has been very influential but the evidence supporting it, now gathered over several decades, is nearly all based on research using the Iowa Gambling Task.</p>
<p>In a <a href="http://psycnet.apa.org/journals/dec/4/1/52/">recent paper</a> in <em>Decision</em>, two British psychologists tested the Somatic Marker Hypothesis in a new context, the Balloon Analogue Risk Task, which involves deciding how far to pump a balloon. They found little evidence to support the central tenet of the Somatic Marker Hypothesis, the idea that our physiological reactions shape our decisions.</p>
<p><span id="more-17215"></span></p>
<p>Rebecca Wright at the University of Essex and Tim Rakow at King’s College London conducted three separate studies involving dozens of participants who completed different versions of the Balloon Analogue Risk Task. The basic version involved participants deciding how far to keep pumping a balloon depicted on-screen. The more participants pumped the balloon, the more points they acquired, which if banked could be traded for cash later. But if they pumped too far before banking their points, the balloon would burst, and the points would be lost. As participants played the task, the researchers measured the amount of perspiration on two of their fingers, which is a well-established physiological marker of emotional arousal.</p>
<p>Wright and Rakow wanted to see if they could find evidence of participants’ physiological reactions shaping their decision-making, comparable to what Damasio and others have found with the Iowa Gambling Task.</p>
<p>In the gambling task, there are four piles of cards, each made up of cards with a different mix of monetary values. Participants have to choose which piles to take cards from in order to end up with as much cash value as possible. The main evidence in support of the Somatic Marker Hypothesis is that when neurologically healthy people perform the task, they often show a physiological reaction (sweatiness of the skin) prior to considering picking cards from a bad pile, even before they realise at a conscious level that the pile is not an optimal one to pick from, thus guiding them towards more optimal choices.</p>
<p>During the balloon task, Wright and Rakow found some limited evidence to support the Somatic Marker Hypothesis. Bad outcomes – that is, when the balloon popped and points were lost – were associated with an increased sweat response. This can be seen as a “somatic mark” or visceral response associated with the experience of a bad outcome. Crucially, however, the researchers found no support for the more contentious idea that physiological responses were shaping participants’ decisions. The participants’ current sweat response was not associated with their upcoming decision about whether to keep pumping the balloon or bank their points.</p>
<p>“We find little support for skin conductance guiding decision-making – a core prediction of the Somatic Marker Hypothesis,” the researchers concluded. Now this is just one set of studies, so it would be rash to conclude from the new findings that the Somatic Marker Hypothesis has no merit. Also, there is a wider evidence-base, not tied directly to Somatic Marker Hypothesis, that supports the broader idea that bodily sensations can influence our decision-making: for instance, <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2012/10/11/people-make-more-moral-decisions-when-they-think-their-heart-is-racing/">a faster heart rate has been linked with making more moral decisions</a>. However, this study highlights the surprising fact that an influential theory in psychology is based on evidence collected in a very narrow context. And when tested in a new way, it has mostly failed.</p>
