<p><a href="http://bmcecol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12898-016-0056-1">Group size, survival and surprisingly short lifespan in socially foraging bats</a></p>
<p>While many bat species roost in large flocks, more stable social groups with individuals also foraging together are relatively rare. The South American Pallas’s mastiff bat lives in such groups, with individuals eavesdropping on the echolocation calls of other group members to help locate their insect prey.</p>
<p>A team of researchers at Max Planck Institute of Ornithology, led by Yann Gager, conducted the first detailed investigation of social structure in these bats. They predicted that the bats would live in small groups, because of the difficulty of co-ordinated flight and likelihood of acoustic interference if the bats foraged in big groups. Or, to put it another way, too many bats would just get in each other’s way. This prediction was proven correct: Pallas’s mastiff bats live in small (but stable) groups of 3-13 individuals.</p>
<p>A more surprising finding was the short lifespan of these bats; just 1.8 years on average, over three times less than the average bat lifespan. The researchers suggest this result’s from the Pallas’s mastiff bats highly specialised diet, feeding on ephemeral insect swarms that only appear at dawn and dusk. A life lived on this “energetic edge” seems to be a short one.</p>
<p><strong>Nematodes in the tropics</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://bmcecol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12898-016-0069-9">What’s in the tank? Nematodes and other major components of the meiofauna of bromeliad phytotelms in lowland Panama</a></p>
<p>Nematode worms are a diverse group of more than 20,000 species (including the classic model species <em>C.elegans</em>) and are remarkably abundant; one estimate suggested that 4 out of every 5 multicellular organisms on the planet are nematodes. Yet for all their abundance, we know astonishingly little about their lives in the wild. For example, there are some indications that nematodes are less species-rich in the tropics than in temperate zones, which would be in stark contrast to most other animal groups. However, this might just reflect our ignorance of nematode diversity and abundance in these regions.</p>
<p>Gerhard Zotz and Walter Traunspurger looked to fill these gaps by investigating nematode diversity in the freshwater habitats created by water trapped in the crowns of tank bromeliad plants in Panama. They found 89 species of nematodes, of varying feeding types, with individual plants containing up to 25 different species. Notably, after rotifers, nematodes were the most abundant animals in these micro-habitats. This suggests that nematodes are actually likely to exist in considerable diversity and abundance in the wider tropical ecosystem; we just need to look for them.</p>

<p><strong>A gut feeling that size matters</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://bmcecol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12898-016-0071-2">Vertebrate bacterial gut diversity: size also matters</a></p>
<p>An increasing body of research suggests that diversity of bacteria in the gut has significant implications for their animal hosts. While many factors seem to affect bacterial diversity within an individual’s gut, a relatively simple one had not previously been studied: size. It is well established that in other habitats greater size generally means greater diversity, so is this also true in the habitat of an animal’s gut?</p>
<p>A team of French researchers at the INRS, led by Jean-Jacques Godon, compared bacterial diversity in the guts of 71 species of birds, reptiles, and mammals (including humans). They found a strong correlation between gut size and diversity, with larger animals generally having a wider range of bacteria present in their guts. Gut volume should therefore be considered along with other parameters when explaining why diversity varies among species.</p>
<p><strong>Boundaries are important for urban rabbits</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://bmcecol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12898-016-0083-y">Importance of latrine communication in European rabbits shifts along a rural-to-urban gradient</a></p>
<p>For many mammals, communication networks are based around deposition of excreta in latrines. These latrines can be formed at the edge of territorial boundaries, for between-group communication, or around key areas of the home range, for within-group communication.</p>
<p>Which type of latrine communication is more important for European rabbits seems to depend on whether they live in rural or urban areas. Urban rabbits locate latrines in higher proportions at the edge of their territories, in contrast to rural rabbits who locate more latrines around their burrows.</p>
<figure class="wp-caption alignright" id="attachment_8262" style="width: 250px;"><img alt="European rabbit" class="size-medium wp-image-8262" height="300" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2016/12/Rabbit-240x300.jpg" width="240" /><div class="attachment-image--caption">European rabbit</div><div class="attachment-image--source"></div></figure>
<p>Rural rabbits seem then to prioritise communication within their social groups. For urban rabbits, with their smaller group sizes but higher population densities, between-group communication seems to be more important; when you have so many neighbours crammed around you, ensuring everyone knows their boundaries becomes crucial. This research provided a novel insight into the alterations man-made habitats can make to animal behavior.</p>
<p><strong>Citizen science: through the looking glass</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://bmcecol.biomedcentral.com/articles/supplements/volume-16-supplement-1"><span style="color: #0066cc;">Citizen science through the OPAL lens</span></a></p>
<p>Citizen science – the collection of data by members of the public in collaboration with professional scientists – has particular potential for the field of ecology. Ecological studies often require data to be collected from far-flung locations over a period of many years; very difficult for a single – or even multiple – research groups to gather. Utilising the wider public can allow the collection of more expansive data sets, with the added benefit of engaging the public in ecological research.</p>
<p>Of course citizen science comes with many challenges, which were discussed in this collection of articles evaluating the success of the UK’s Open Air Laboratories national citizen science network, now approaching its 10<sup>th</sup> anniversary. What makes lay-people keen to become involved with research, the quality of the data they gather, and the results arising from these studies were among the topics discussed.</p>
<p>Collection organiser Poppy Fraser Lakeman discussed these issues in more detail <a href="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/2016/07/22/citizen-science-looking-glass/"><span style="color: #0066cc;">on our blog</span></a>.</p>
<p><strong>A cockroach in disguise</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://bmcecol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12898-016-0089-5"><span style="color: #0066cc;">Chemical disguise of myrmecophilous cockroaches and its implications for understanding nestmate recognition mechanisms in leaf-cutting ants</span></a></p>
<p><em>Attaphila</em> cockroaches make a living by sneaking into the nests of leaf-cutter ants. These ants farm a fungus that provides an ideal food source for the invading cockroaches. Research led by Volker Nehring and Patrizia d’Ettorre at the University of Copenhagen investigated how the cockroaches steal food from a heavily guarded ant colony without being detected.</p>
<p>Behavioural experiments suggest that cockroaches are able to disguise themselves with the colony-specific cuticular chemical profile used by the ants to recognise their nest-mates; cockroaches were not attacked by ants from the same colony they live in, but were attacked by ants from other colonies. Chemical analysis confirmed that the cockroaches copy their host colonies specific cuticular chemical profile.</p>
<figure class="wp-caption alignleft" id="attachment_8263" style="width: 293px;"><img alt="An Attaphila male on the fungus garden of a leaf-cutting ant colony" class="size-medium wp-image-8263" height="300" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2016/12/Cockroach-283x300.jpg" width="283" /><div class="attachment-image--caption">An <em>Attaphila</em> male on the fungus garden of a leaf-cutting ant colony. From Nehring et al. 2016</div><div class="attachment-image--source"></div></figure>
<p>Studying these cockroaches also enables us to learn more about how the ants themselves communicate. Cockroach species with lower concentrations of cuticular chemicals were less likely to be attacked by ants from other colonies. This supports the asymmetric model of ant nest-mate recognition; rather than ‘knowing’ their colonies specific profile, ants just respond to any unfamiliar cues; hence cockroaches with fewer chemical cues are less likely to find their disguise being uncovered.</p>
<p><strong>Hunting as a management tool?</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://bmcecol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12898-016-0098-4"><span style="color: #0066cc;">Hunting as a management tool? Cougar-human conflict is positively related to hunting pressure</span></a></p>
<p>When large predators roam near human settlements, conflict can become inevitable. A common approach to managing these pressures is to allow human hunters to remove predators near human settlements. The assumption is that this reduces human-predator conflict: an assumption this research challenges.</p>
<p>Analysing a 30 year dataset on hunter-caused cougar mortality in Canada, researchers found a clear pattern of greater cougar trophy-hunting <em>increasing</em> human-cougar conflict. They note that trophy hunters focus on the largest males, yet it is usually smaller, younger males that are more likely to come into conflict with humans. Removing large resident males may also disrupt cougar social structures, dispersing cougars over larger areas and making conflict with humans more likely.</p>
<p>The work adds to a growing body of evidence that hunting provides a poor – and often counter-productive – method for managing conflict with large predators.</p>
<p>Authors Kristine Teichman, Bogdan Cristescu and Chris Darimont discussed their research in more detail <a href="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/2016/10/27/trophy-hunting-unexpected-consequences-cougar-human-conflict/"><span style="color: #0066cc;">on our blog</span></a>.</p>
<p><strong>Dinosaur distributions</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://bmcecol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12898-016-0106-8"><span style="color: #0066cc;">Palaeoenvironmental drivers of vertebrate community composition in the Belly River Group (Campanian) of Alberta, Canada, with implications for dinosaur biogeography</span></a></p>
<p>A long-standing – and somewhat perplexing – problem in dinosaur ecology is the apparent high levels of diversity of large-bodied dinosaurs in North America during the Cretaceous period. Unlike modern-day large-bodied vertebrates where a few species, such as wolves and caribou, roam across very large areas, their dinosaur equivalents of 70 million years ago lived in much narrower ranges.</p>
<p>Thomas Cullen and David Evans at the University of Toronto assessed the reasons behind these patterns by studying fossil microsites from the late Cretaceous of Alberta, Canada. Microsites are concentrated assemblages of small bones and teeth, thought to provide a good representation of community composition at the time they were deposited.</p>
<p>The prevailing theory to explain high dinosaur diversity is that these species were particularly sensitive to environmental changes, preventing them from roaming across large areas. The researchers tested this by comparing dinosaur diversity at two environmentally distinct microsites from the same time period. Contrary to this theory, there was no difference in relative abundance of different dinosaur taxa in these differing environments. A different explanation would appear to be required to explain this perplexing historical pattern.</p>

<p><strong>Then and now: tracking the decline of an iconic tree</strong></p>

<p>The Clanwilliam cedar is one of South Africa’s most iconic trees. It is also one of its most endangered. Tracking declines in long-lived species like the Clanwilliam cedar is difficult due to a lack of historical data, but this study demonstrated a novel way of doing so using repeat photography.</p>
<p>Researchers at the University of Cape Town, led by Joseph White, tracked down 87 historical photos of Clanwilliam cedars (stretching back 80 years) and meticulously recreated these photos, creating a visual record of population changes. The photos suggest tree numbers declined significantly over this period, but also suggest which habitats are best suited to their survival, which should help focus future conservation efforts.</p>

<p>To see a man’s face light up as he strokes a dog, to hear a child’s laughter as her hamster tickles her skin, it just seems obvious that animals are good for our state of mind. Let’s hope so because not only do millions of us own pets, but also animals are being used therapeutically in an increasing number of contexts, from residential care homes to airports, prisons, hospitals, schools and universities. Unfortunately, as detailed by psychologist Molly Crossman in her <a href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jclp.22410/abstract?systemMessage=Wiley+Online+Library+will+be+unavailable+on+Saturday+17th+December+2016+at+09%3A00+GMT%2F+04%3A00+EST%2F+17%3A00+SGT+for+4hrs+due+to+essential+maintenance.Apologies+for+the+inconvenience">new review</a> in the <em>Journal of Clinical Psychology</em>, the research literature has simply not kept pace with the widespread embrace of animal contact as a form of therapy in itself, or as a therapy adjunct. In short, we don’t know whether animal contact is psychologically beneficial, and if it is, we have no idea how.</p>
<p><span id="more-15634"></span></p>
<p>After several decades of animal-human interaction research, Crossman explains that the evidence is mixed: some studies have found benefits, others have not. And the research has tended to be of poor quality. In relation to animal-based therapy or animal-assisted therapy, for example, those studies showing benefits have usually only looked over short-term outcomes; they’ve not compared the generalisability of effects from one animal to another; and they’ve typically had no control condition, so there’s no way of knowing if the apparent positive outcomes are simply due to the passage of time, or to any kind of sociable or pleasurable activity.</p>
<p>Another issue is that, for obvious reasons, animal-based therapy always requires the presence of a human handler, but existing studies have always failed to account for the effect of this person. This means it’s possible that any benefits are solely or partly down to the friendliness and company of the handler, as opposed to the animal.</p>
<p>Similarly most research on the benefits of pet ownership (as opposed to animal therapy) has been observational, rather than involving any experimental allocation of pets to some participants, with other participants placed in a no-pet control condition. Again, this makes it difficult to source any apparent benefits to animal companionship per se. “There is not yet sufficient evidence to conclude that companion animal ownership conveys benefits for human health,” Crossman writes.</p>
<p>Even if we assume that the apparent psychological benefits of animals are real, Crossman also explains that there has been virtually no research into the mechanisms. She identifies several possibilities, all of which need testing, including: the simple pleasure of the interaction; the passing of positive emotions from animal to human; feeling that the animal is providing unconditional love; and the benefits of tactile contact. There is also likely to be a large placebo effect.</p>
<p>Finding out how and why animal contact is psychological beneficial and for whom would help to maximise the positive impact of using animals for therapeutic reasons. Crossman points out that the idea of there being positive emotional contagion from animal to human also reminds us that it’s important to consider the effect of animal therapy on animals, and not to sacrifice their welfare in the process of helping people.</p>
<p>Some may wonder whether it matters that there is such a dearth of quality research in this field. As Crossman says, many people just feel they “know” that animal contact is beneficial and “they’re often sceptical of the need for empirical evidence.” But the wider psychotherapy literature teaches us that there are dangers in assuming interventions are always going to be helpful – animal therapy or ownership might not work for everyone, and in some cases it could even be detrimental. For instance, the responsibility of a pet might backfire for someone who is struggling to cope with stress.</p>
<p>“Researchers and practitioners have called for methodological improvements and advancements [in human-animal interaction research] for nearly half a century, but those calls remain largely unanswered,” Crossman writes. “At this point, the clearest conclusion in the field is that we cannot yet draw clear conclusions.”</p>

 Packaging of the genome into a protein capsid and its subsequent delivery into a host cell are two fundamental processes in the life cycle of a virus. Unlike double-stranded DNA viruses, which pump their genome into a preformed capsid, single-stranded RNA (ssRNA) viruses, such as bacteriophage MS2, co-assemble their capsid with the genome; however, the structural basis of this co-assembly is poorly understood. MS2 infects Escherichia coli via the host ‘sex pilus’ (F-pilus); it was the first fully sequenced organism and is a model system for studies of translational gene regulation, RNA–protein interactions, and RNA virus assembly. Its positive-sense ssRNA genome of 3,569 bases is enclosed in a capsid with one maturation protein monomer and 89 coat protein dimers arranged in a T = 3 icosahedral lattice. The maturation protein is responsible for attaching the virus to an F-pilus and delivering the viral genome into the host during infection, but how the genome is organized and delivered is not known. Here we describe the MS2 structure at 3.6 Å resolution, determined by electron-counting cryo-electron microscopy (cryoEM) and asymmetric reconstruction. We traced approximately 80% of the backbone of the viral genome, built atomic models for 16 RNA stem–loops, and identified three conserved motifs of RNA–coat protein interactions among 15 of these stem–loops with diverse sequences. The stem–loop at the 3′ end of the genome interacts extensively with the maturation protein, which, with just a six-helix bundle and a six-stranded β-sheet, forms a genome-delivery apparatus and joins 89 coat protein dimers to form a capsid. This atomic description of genome–capsid interactions in a spherical ssRNA virus provides insight into genome delivery via the host sex pilus and mechanisms underlying ssRNA–capsid co-assembly, and inspires speculation about the links between nucleoprotein complexes and the origins of viruses.

<p>In an effort to fight global poverty, the United Nations has launched the <a href="http://www.un.org/sustainabledevelopment/">Sustainable Development Goals</a> project to encourage countries to ‘mobilize efforts to end all forms of poverty, fight inequalities and tackle climate change, while ensuring that no one is left behind’. A major part of this process is ensuring the availability of data on key development indicators to assess inequalities between and within countries and determine how these change over time. Monitoring health inequalities can uncover the effect of health policies, programs and interventions on specific disadvantaged subgroups and involves collecting, analysing, interpreting and reporting various types of health data. This article describes a toolkit developed by the World Health Organisation (WHO) to display and assess the health inequalities in any given country: the <a href="http://www.who.int/gho/health_equity/assessment_toolkit/en/">Health Equity Assessment Toolkit (HEAT)</a>.</p>
<p>HEAT contains data from the WHO’s He<img alt="World Globe and Stethoscope on White Background" class="size-medium wp-image-8268 alignleft" height="200" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2016/12/Globe-and-stethoscope-300x200.jpg" width="300" />alth Equity Monitor database which includes information from 94 low- or middle-income countries. The software allows the assessment of inequalities within a country using over 30 reproductive, maternal, new-born and child health indicators and five dimensions of inequality (economic status, education, place of residence, sub-national region and child’s sex) providing information about health interventions and health outcomes. The development of the toolkit marks a huge step forward in the monitoring of health inequalities which could in the future help to inform policy makers and national priority-setting for healthcare.</p>
<p><a href="http://bmcmedresmethodol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12874-016-0232-1">How does the choice of database affect the results of a meta-analysis?</a></p>

One of the most important methodological considerations is how the literature is searched, including how many and which bibliographic databases should be used. There is limited quantitative evidence to guide this process, so the authors of this study set out to investigate the effect of selective database searching on the results of meta-analyses. Their study revealed that meta-analysis results generally did not differ significantly when different combinations of databases were searched and that the majority of relevant studies can be found within a limited number of databases. The study provides information which can be used to increase the efficiency of systematic reviews, and provides further guidance for the assessment and development of more recent forms of knowledge synthesis such as <a href="https://systematicreviewsjournal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/2046-4053-1-10">rapid reviews</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://bmcmedresmethodol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12874-016-0247-7">Why sex and gender matter in implementation science</a></p>
<p>Researchers are being encouraged more and more to take sex and gender into account when carrying out medical research. This debate article considers the progress that has been made in taking sex and gender into account in implementation science, which considers how research findings are put into practice. A review of the current literature, including assessment of the top ten articles published in the journal <a href="http://implementationscience.biomedcentral.com/"><em>Implementation Science</em></a> in 2015, revealed that few studies mention sex and gender as a consideration. This is despite the fact that there is now guidance on these considerations available from groups such as the <a href="http://methods.cochrane.org/equity/welcome">Cochrane Collaboration’s Methods Equity group</a>.</p>
<p>The article then goes on to define the difference between sex and gender; the former being a classification based on the biology of the individual (according to genetics, anatomy and physiology) and the latter being a construct that is fluid and influenced by social and cultural context. Whilst biological sex is generally simple to measure, the measurement of an individual’s gender is more nuanced with the authors separating it into four constructs: gender roles, gender identity, gender relations and institutionalised gender. They highlight the need for both the qualitative and quantitative measurement of these factors in order to inform implementation research methods. They describe their importance at multiple points along the implementation process, from the content and messaging surrounding an intervention, to decision making around the uptake of an intervention.</p>

The classic methods of meta-analysis and systematic review can be labour intensive and so researchers are investigating ways to simplify this process whilst still maintaining accuracy and rigour. An emerging evidence synthesis method is evidence mapping which can be used as a first step in conducting a broad systematic review and can clarify where there is sufficient evidence to inform policy makers as well as identify research dense areas where systematic reviews could be pursued. Areas where there is a lack of evidence can also be identified, known as research gaps, where further studies may be needed.</p>
<p>There are currently no methodological standards for evidence mapping which led the authors of this study to describe the process and methodology of creating an evidence map database using the topic of low-calorie sweeteners (LCS) and selected health outcomes of interest as an example. With the help of a stakeholder panel, a comprehensive literature search strategy was developed and refined. Outcomes from the studies identified in this search were classified into clinically and biologically meaningful outcome categories which were then analysed to identify how data have been reported on each outcome and where there are research gaps. Assessment of the frequency of publications in each outcome category revealed areas where research outputs increased over specific periods of time. An example of a research gap that was uncovered was the assessment of appetite and dietary intake outcomes using a LCS intervention with a sugar intake comparison in people with diabetes.</p>
<p>The steps presented in this article can be applied to create an evidence map database for any research topic of interest. Through the creation of this database, researchers and practitioners can easily acquire information necessary for decision-making, such as directions for future research and the basis for evidence synthesis, in a fraction of the time needed to conduct comprehensive literature reviews.</p>

<p><img alt="doctor-computer-smartphone-and-patient" class="alignleft wp-image-8282 size-medium" height="228" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2016/12/Doctor-computer-smartphone-and-patient-300x228.jpg" title="Istock photo" width="300" />Health research is frequently carried out in a clinical setting with clinicians being directly involved in the research process. This brings many benefits including increasing the clinical relevance of research questions, gaining access to clinical settings for research, and bringing clinical expertise and insider perspectives. However, there are ethical and methodological implications that should be considered when clinicians undertake a research role. In this study, the authors systematically reviewed published articles looking at the clinician-researcher dual-role and summarise the key findings from the literature.</p>
<p>The main finding was that clinician-researchers cannot adopt a wholly non-clinical research identity. This was attributed to the fact that it was not possible to maintain a strict researcher-participant relationship when the participant had previously been treated as a patient by the clinician-researcher. Consciously and subconsciously, the clinician and patient roles are present in the research setting, creating shared ground and a connection that resembles a clinician-patient relationship. Clinicians also described their struggles with separating themselves from the clinical role when carrying out research, suggesting that there are deep rooted characteristics which cannot be shed when a clinician moves into a research context. The authors recommend that clinician-researchers should be encouraged to accept and explore the factors surrounding the dual-role phenomenon, consider both roles throughout the research process, and ensure that clinical and research roles are not artificially separated in research protocols, ethics applications, and research practice.</p>

<p>Exposing your body to cold water has been promoted as a health tonic since at least the Roman period, so it’s about time we gave this a thorough investigation. In <a href="http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0161749">a new paper</a> in <em>PLOS One</em> Geert Buijze and his colleagues report on the health and wellbeing effects of the “cool challenge” – a 30-day event in the Netherlands that involved more than 3000 people taking daily showers that ran cold for at least the last 30 seconds each time.</p>
<p>The clearest finding was a 29 per cent reduction in sickness absence for those who took cold showers compared with their colleagues who weren’t involved in the challenge; the length of the cold blast, whether 30 seconds or 90, didn’t matter. However cold showers didn’t provide an immunisation against sickness as such. The challenge participants felt ill as frequently as their colleagues, it’s just that somehow they were better able to fight through it and make it to work.</p>
<p>Most of the psychological factors that the researchers measured were not influenced by the chilly treatment. Participants reported a small increase in quality of life after 30 days, but that disappeared when re-measured later; meanwhile work productivity and levels of anxiety were unaffected. But the participants did report some other benefits such as higher energy levels, comparable to drinking a coffee, and over two thirds chose to continue the challenge for a further two months.</p>
<p>On this evidence, cold showers don’t refresh all the parts we might desire, but seem to insulate against the effects of illness and provide some yet to be determined energetic effects. Why? Maybe thanks to effects on the levels of hormones such as cortisol and norepinephrine, which respond in the short-term to a cold dousing. Or simply the benefit of a short daily physical activity – the power of a good shiver.</p>

<hr class="docutils" />
<p>We model the effects of excitation and inhibition on the gain of cortical neurons. Previous theoretical work has concluded that excitation or inhibition alone will not cause a multiplicative gain change in the curve of firing rate versus input current. However, such gain changes in vivo are measured in the curve of firing rate versus stimulus parameter. We find that when this curve is considered, and when the nonlinear relationships between stimulus parameter and input current and between input current and firing rate in vivo are taken into account, then simple excitation or inhibition alone can induce a multiplicative gain change. In particular, the power-law relationship between voltage and firing rate that is induced by neuronal noise is critical to this result. This suggests an unexpectedly simple mechanism that may underlie the gain modulations commonly observed in cortex. More generally, it suggests that a smaller input will multiplicatively modulate the gain of a larger one when both converge on a common cortical target.</p>

            <p><em><img alt="human head model with open window on side idea concept" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-15624" src="https://researchdigest.files.wordpress.com/2016/12/thinkstockphotos-599252754.jpg?w=845" />By guest blogger</em> <a href="https://clippings.me/users/d_a_robson">David Robson</a></p>
<p>If you want to maximise a person’s intellectual potential, the general consensus for a long time has been that you need to start young. According to this traditional view, early childhood offers a precious “window of opportunity” or “sensitive period” for learning that closes slowly as we reach adolescence. It’s the reason that toddlers find it easier to master the accent of a foreign language, for instance.</p>
<p>This view has even shaped educational policy. If you want to help people from disadvantaged backgrounds, for instance, some psychologists had argued that you would do better to target primary schools, with <a href="http://jenni.uchicago.edu/papers/Heckman_Science_v312_2006.pdf">diminishing returns for interventions later in life</a>, as if badly performing <a href="http://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736%2813%2962201-1/fulltext?rss=yes">teenagers were something of a lost cause</a>.</p>
<p>Sarah-Jayne Blakemore at University College London has spent the last decade <a href="https://www.edge.org/conversation/sarah_jayne_blakemore-the-adolescent-brain">over-turning some of these assumptions</a>, showing that the adolescent brain is still remarkably flexible as it <a href="https://www.ted.com/talks/sarah_jayne_blakemore_the_mysterious_workings_of_the_adolescent_brain">undergoes profound anatomical changes</a>. “The idea that the brain is somehow fixed in early childhood, which was an idea that was very strongly believed up until fairly recently, is completely wrong,” she told <a href="https://www.edge.org/conversation/sarah_jayne_blakemore-the-adolescent-brain"><em>Edge</em> in 2012</a>. The transformation is particularly marked in the prefrontal lobes (located behind the forehead) and the parietal lobes (underneath and just behind the top of your head) – two regions that are involved in abstract thought.</p>
<p>The upshot is that teenagers may go through a second sensitive period, in which they are particularly responsive to certain kinds of intellectual stimulation. A new <a href="http://pss.sagepub.com/content/27/12/1620">paper</a> from Blakemore’s lab, published in <em>Psychological Science,</em> builds on this idea, showing that our ability to learn certain kinds of analytical skills doesn’t diminish after childhood, but actually increases through adolescence and into early adulthood.</p>

<p><img alt="ravens" class=" size-full wp-image-15613 alignleft" src="https://researchdigest.files.wordpress.com/2016/12/ravens.png?w=845" />The team – led by Lisa Knoll – recruited more than 600 participants aged 11 to 33, and randomly assigned them to three groups, each trained in a different skill. They taught the first group “numerosity discrimination”, which involved rapidly guessing the number of coloured dots to appear on a screen. They trained the second group in “relational reasoning”: the ability to detect abstract rules and relationships using the kind of non-verbal puzzles (known as Raven’s Matrices) that are common in some IQ tests (see image left). The third group, meanwhile, honed their facial perception: they judged repeatedly whether two photos, shown in rapid succession, represented the same person or not.</p>
<p>It’s worth noting that these skills don’t require any advanced factual knowledge. Instead, they represent a broader capacity for abstract thought and pattern recognition that might be useful for many kinds of academic work.</p>
<p>The online training sessions were short but frequent, lasting a maximum of 12 minutes a day for 20 days. The participants were then tested – with the same kinds of puzzles used in training – shortly after they had finished their last session, and again a few months later, to see whether the skills had stuck</p>
<p>Sadly, the participants in the third group would have been disappointed if they ever had hopes of being a “<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/nov/05/metropolitan-police-super-recognisers">super-recogniser</a>” – their facial perception showed next to no improvement.</p>
<p>But the hard work paid off for many of the other participants – those learning the relational reasoning and the numerosity discrimination had all boosted their scores. Based on these successes, Blakemore, Knoll and colleagues next examined whether those gains depended on the participants’ age.</p>
<p>According to the accepted wisdom, they should have seen the greatest dividends among the youngest subjects aged 11-13, when they were closest to that childhood window of opportunity. But as the psychologists had expected, the older participants turned out to gain the most from the training. The late adolescents (aged 16-18) improved their relational reasoning by around 10 per cent, for instance – nearly twice the gains of younger participants. Even the adults in the group tended to perform better than the youngsters, suggesting that our 20s and early 30s may still be a fertile time for self-improvement.</p>
<p>At least in these kinds of analytical skills, the window of opportunity was still wide open, perhaps reflecting the greater neuroplasticity – the ability to forge new neural circuits – of the prefrontal cortex that Blakemore had previously observed in the brain scans. If so, it supports her idea that we may have multiple sensitive periods for different kinds of skills depending on the brain’s development at that time. As one window of opportunity closes, another may open.</p>
<p>There are other potential explanations, though. The researchers tried to control for the participants’ motivation, showing that the results still held when you took into account the number of completed training sessions. It seems the older participants weren’t just trying harder. But it’s also possible that the teenagers and adults had developed better cognitive strategies for learning: deliberate mental procedures that don’t necessarily reflect greater anatomical plasticity.</p>
<p>Given the <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2016/10/07/brain-training-exercises-just-make-you-better-at-brain-training-exercises/">recent controversies surrounding brain training</a>, it’s also worth noting that we don’t know whether these improvements led to meaningful changes in other areas of the participants’ lives. Blakemore and Knoll couldn’t find any corresponding boost in working memory, for instance, and we don’t know if these abstract analytical skills would correspond to a greater aptitude for mathematics or science at school or university.</p>
<p>Even so, I’m intrigued about the potential implications and the promise this holds for future research, adding further evidence to the growing body of work showing that adolescence is a fascinating and potentially fertile period of intellectual growth. Contrary to our <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/science/science-news/11410483/Revealed-the-science-behind-teenage-laziness.html">sometimes dim view of teenagers</a>, there’s much more to those years than the acne and the angst.</p>

            <p><em><img alt="A happy couple runs through waves on sunlit beach" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-15595" src="https://researchdigest.files.wordpress.com/2016/12/thinkstockphotos-167408896.jpg?w=845" />By</em> <a href="http://www.psychologywriter.org.uk/">Christian Jarrett</a></p>
<p>Poets have long described the mind-altering effects of a passionate relationship – “my love’s a noble madness” wrote John Dryden. “Of all the emotions,” said Cicero, “there is none more violent than love. Love is a madness.” Psychology research is beginning to back this up. A <a href="http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11031-013-9380-3">recent study</a> found that students in the early days of a passionate relationship exhibited reduced cognitive control in basic psychological tests. Now brain researchers in Japan have started to look for the neural correlates of these effects. <a href="http://journal.frontiersin.org/article/10.3389/fpsyg.2016.01763/full?utm_source=newsletter&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=Psychology-w47-2016#B8">Writing in <em>Frontiers in Psychology</em></a>, Hiroaki Kawamichi and his colleagues report the results of their brain imaging experiment showing that participants in the relatively early stages of a romantic relationship had reduced grey matter in a region of the brain involved in processing reward, which might suggest their brains had adjusted to the intensity of their love affair.</p>
<p><span id="more-15510"></span></p>
<p>The researchers recruited  56 young men and women who were currently in a romantic relationship of at least one month’s duration (the average length was 17 months), and for comparison they recruited 57 age-matched control participants who were not currently in a relationship. All the participants completed a happiness survey and also underwent a structural brain scan.</p>
<p>The participants in an early-stage romantic relationship were happier than those who were single. And looking across the entire brain, the researchers found one specific area – the right-dorsal <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Striatum">striatum</a> – that was structurally different in the in-love participants compared with the singletons, in terms of there being reduced grey matter density in the lovers. This region is found near the front of the brain, beneath the cortex and is involved in reward processing.</p>
<p>It’s interesting that the researchers found this brain difference but without any psychological testing, or functional or connectivity-based brain scanning – which could show how brain areas speak to each other and how they operate during different mental activities – it’s very difficult to interpret its meaning.</p>
<p>Another short-coming is that the scans were taken at just one point in time, so we’ve no way of knowing if being in love shrinks the right-dorsal striatum or if people with less grey matter in this area are more likely to fall in love (I’m also using terms like “in love” liberally because we don’t have any detail on the intensity of the participants’ romances). The only clue we have about cause and effect here is that, across all participants, the researchers found no link between striatal volume and total time in life spent in romantic relationships, suggesting a reversibility to any potential effects of romance on the brain.</p>
<p>Putting these important cautions to one side, it does seem plausible that enjoying a passionate romance could lead to grey matter reductions in the striatum, <a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1053811911001911">just as has been found in cocaine users</a>, for example. This would make sense if you think of being in love as an intensely rewarding time, in which case the brain might “down-regulate” its reward sensitivity, adjusting to a world where there is joy to be found in each touch and embrace with, or even merely thoughts of, that special other. It might also explain why a split can be so painful – the brain spoilt by such constant reward, left craving and expectant for a comfort that’s no longer there.</p>

 Accumulating data suggest that metastatic dissemination often occurs early during tumour formation, but the mechanisms of early metastatic spread have not yet been addressed. Here, by studying metastasis in a HER2-driven mouse breast cancer model, we show that progesterone-induced signalling triggers migration of cancer cells from early lesions shortly after HER2 activation, but promotes proliferation in advanced primary tumour cells. The switch from migration to proliferation was regulated by increased HER2 expression and tumour-cell density involving microRNA-mediated progesterone receptor downregulation, and was reversible. Cells from early, low-density lesions displayed more stemness features, migrated more and founded more metastases than cells from dense, advanced tumours. Notably, we found that at least 80% of metastases were derived from early disseminated cancer cells. Karyotypic and phenotypic analysis of human disseminated cancer cells and primary tumours corroborated the relevance of these findings for human metastatic dissemination.

 The precise control of an ion channel gate by environmental stimuli is crucial for the fulfilment of its biological role. The gate in Slo1 K+ channels is regulated by two separate stimuli, intracellular Ca2+ concentration and membrane voltage. Slo1 is thus central to understanding the relationship between intracellular Ca2+ and membrane excitability. Here we present the Slo1 structure from Aplysia californica in the absence of Ca2+ and compare it with the Ca2+-bound channel. We show that Ca2+ binding at two unique binding sites per subunit stabilizes an expanded conformation of the Ca2+ sensor gating ring. These conformational changes are propagated from the gating ring to the pore through covalent linkers and through protein interfaces formed between the gating ring and the voltage sensors. The gating ring and the voltage sensors are directly connected through these interfaces, which allow membrane voltage to regulate gating of the pore by influencing the Ca2+ sensors.

 Metastasis is the leading cause of cancer-related deaths; metastatic lesions develop from disseminated cancer cells (DCCs) that can remain dormant. Metastasis-initiating cells are thought to originate from a subpopulation present in progressed, invasive tumours. However, DCCs detected in patients before the manifestation of breast-cancer metastasis contain fewer genetic abnormalities than primary tumours or than DCCs from patients with metastases. These findings, and those in pancreatic cancer and melanoma models, indicate that dissemination might occur during the early stages of tumour evolution. However, the mechanisms that might allow early disseminated cancer cells (eDCCs) to complete all steps of metastasis are unknown. Here we show that, in early lesions in mice and before any apparent primary tumour masses are detected, there is a sub-population of Her2+p-p38lop-Atf2loTwist1hiE-cadlo early cancer cells that is invasive and can spread to target organs. Intra-vital imaging and organoid studies of early lesions showed that Her2+ eDCC precursors invaded locally, intravasated and lodged in target organs. Her2+ eDCCs activated a Wnt-dependent epithelial–mesenchymal transition (EMT)-like dissemination program but without complete loss of the epithelial phenotype, which was reversed by Her2 or Wnt inhibition. Notably, although the majority of eDCCs were Twist1hiE-cadlo and dormant, they eventually initiated metastasis. Our work identifies a mechanism for early dissemination in which Her2 aberrantly activates a program similar to mammary ductal branching that generates eDCCs that are capable of forming metastasis after a dormancy phase.

 The Ca2+-activated K+ channel, Slo1, has an unusually large conductance and contains a voltage sensor and multiple chemical sensors. Dual activation by membrane voltage and Ca2+ renders Slo1 central to processes that couple electrical signalling to Ca2+-mediated events such as muscle contraction and neuronal excitability. Here we present the cryo-electron microscopy structure of a full-length Slo1 channel from Aplysia californica in the presence of Ca2+ and Mg2+ at a resolution of 3.5 Å. The channel adopts an open conformation. Its voltage-sensor domain adopts a non-domain-swapped attachment to the pore and contacts the cytoplasmic Ca2+-binding domain from a neighbouring subunit. Unique structural features of the Slo1 voltage sensor suggest that it undergoes different conformational changes than other known voltage sensors. The structure reveals the molecular details of three distinct divalent cation-binding sites identified through electrophysiological studies of mutant Slo1 channels.

 Seahorses have a specialized morphology that includes a toothless tubular mouth, a body covered with bony plates, a male brood pouch, and the absence of caudal and pelvic fins. Here we report the sequencing and de novo assembly of the genome of the tiger tail seahorse, Hippocampus comes. Comparative genomic analysis identifies higher protein and nucleotide evolutionary rates in H. comes compared with other teleost fish genomes. We identified an astacin metalloprotease gene family that has undergone expansion and is highly expressed in the male brood pouch. We also find that the H. comes genome lacks enamel matrix protein-coding proline/glutamine-rich secretory calcium-binding phosphoprotein genes, which might have led to the loss of mineralized teeth. tbx4, a regulator of hindlimb development, is also not found in H. comes genome. Knockout of tbx4 in zebrafish showed a ‘pelvic fin-loss’ phenotype similar to that of seahorses.

 The pressing global issue of food insecurity due to population growth, diminishing land and variable climate can only be addressed in agriculture by improving both maximum crop yield potential and resilience. Genetic modification is one potential solution, but has yet to achieve worldwide acceptance, particularly for crops such as wheat. Trehalose-6-phosphate (T6P), a central sugar signal in plants, regulates sucrose use and allocation, underpinning crop growth and development. Here we show that application of a chemical intervention strategy directly modulates T6P levels in planta. Plant-permeable analogues of T6P were designed and constructed based on a ‘signalling-precursor’ concept for permeability, ready uptake and sunlight-triggered release of T6P in planta. We show that chemical intervention in a potent sugar signal increases grain yield, whereas application to vegetative tissue improves recovery and resurrection from drought. This technology offers a means to combine increases in yield with crop stress resilience. Given the generality of the T6P pathway in plants and other small-molecule signals in biology, these studies suggest that suitable synthetic exogenous small-molecule signal precursors can be used to directly enhance plant performance and perhaps other organism function.

 The type III secretion (T3S) injectisome is a specialized protein nanomachine that is critical for the pathogenicity of many Gram-negative bacteria, including purveyors of plague, typhoid fever, whooping cough, sexually transmitted infections and major nosocomial infections. This syringe-shaped 3.5-MDa macromolecular assembly spans both bacterial membranes and that of the infected host cell. The internal channel formed by the injectisome allows for the direct delivery of partially unfolded virulence effectors into the host cytoplasm. The structural foundation of the injectisome is the basal body, a molecular lock-nut structure composed predominantly of three proteins that form highly oligomerized concentric rings spanning the inner and outer membranes. Here we present the structure of the prototypical Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium pathogenicity island 1 basal body, determined using single-particle cryo-electron microscopy, with the inner-membrane-ring and outer-membrane-ring oligomers defined at 4.3 Å and 3.6 Å resolution, respectively. This work presents the first, to our knowledge, high-resolution structural characterization of the major components of the basal body in the assembled state, including that of the widespread class of outer-membrane portals known as secretins.

 Enzymes are ideal for use in asymmetric catalysis by the chemical industry, because their chemical compositions can be tailored to a specific substrate and selectivity pattern while providing efficiencies and selectivities that surpass those of classical synthetic methods. However, enzymes are limited to reactions that are found in nature and, as such, facilitate fewer types of transformation than do other forms of catalysis. Thus, a longstanding challenge in the field of biologically mediated catalysis has been to develop enzymes with new catalytic functions. Here we describe a method for achieving catalytic promiscuity that uses the photoexcited state of nicotinamide co-factors (molecules that assist enzyme-mediated catalysis). Under irradiation with visible light, the nicotinamide-dependent enzyme known as ketoreductase can be transformed from a carbonyl reductase into an initiator of radical species and a chiral source of hydrogen atoms. We demonstrate this new reactivity through a highly enantioselective radical dehalogenation of lactones—a challenging transformation for small-molecule catalysts. Mechanistic experiments support the theory that a radical species acts as an intermediate in this reaction, with NADH and NADPH (the reduced forms of nicotinamide adenine nucleotide and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate, respectively) serving as both a photoreductant and the source of hydrogen atoms. To our knowledge, this method represents the first example of photo-induced enzyme promiscuity, and highlights the potential for accessing new reactivity from existing enzymes simply by using the excited states of common biological co-factors. This represents a departure from existing light-driven biocatalytic techniques, which are typically explored in the context of co-factor regeneration.
