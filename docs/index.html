              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/new-asteroid-gaia-map-milky-way-galaxy-stars">New Gaia data paint the most detailed picture yet of the Milky Way</a></h4>

              
                <p>1.6 billion stars. 11.4 million galaxies. 158,000 asteroids.</p>



<p>One spacecraft.</p>



<p>The European Space Agency’s Gaia space observatory, which launched in 2013, has long surpassed its goal of charting more than a billion <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/gaia-missions-milky-way-map-pinpoints-locations-billion-plus-stars">stars in the Milky Way</a> (<em>SN: 10/15/16)</em>. On June 13, the mission extended that map into new dimensions, releasing more detailed measurements of hundreds of millions of stars, plus — for the first time — asteroids, galaxies and the dusty medium between stars.</p>





<p>“Suddenly you have a flood of data,” says Laurent Eyer, an astrophysicist at the University of Geneva who has worked on Gaia for years. For some topics in astronomy, the new results effectively replace all the observations that were taken before, Eyer says. “The data is better. It’s amazing.”</p>



<p>Data in the new survey, which were collected from 2014 to 2017, are already leading to some discoveries — including the presence of surprisingly massive&nbsp; <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/stars-may-keep-spinning-fast-long-old-age">“starquakes”</a> on the surfaces of thousands of stars (<em>SN: 8/2/19</em>). But more than anything, the release is a new tool for astronomers, one that will aid their efforts to understand how stars, planets and entire galaxies form and evolve.</p>



<p>Here are a few of the long-standing puzzles the data could help solve.&nbsp;</p>



<h4>Asteroid mishmash</h4>



<p>The asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter is a mess of history. After the Earth and other planets formed, the rocky building blocks that were left over smashed into each other, leaving behind jumbled fragments. But if scientists know enough about individual asteroids, they can reconstruct when and <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/ryugu-came-two-other-asteroids">where they came from</a> <em>(SN: 4/13/19)</em>. And that can provide a peek into the solar system’s earliest days.</p>

<p>Gaia’s massive new dataset may help solve this puzzle, says Federica Spoto, an astrophysicist at the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics in Cambridge, Mass. It includes data on the chemical makeup of over 60,000 asteroids — six times more than researchers had such details on before using other tools. That information can be essential for tracing asteroids back to their shattering origins.</p>



<p>“You can go back in time and try to understand all the formation and evolution of the solar system,” says Spoto, a Gaia collaborator.<strong> “</strong>That’s something huge that before Gaia we couldn’t even think about.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Asteroids aren’t just pieces of the past, though; they’re also dangerous. The new data could reveal asteroids that are <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/first-time-asteroid-has-been-found-nearer-sun-than-venus">next to impossible to spot</a> from Earth because they orbit too close to the sun, says Thomas Burbine, a planetary scientist at Mount Holyoke College in South Hadley, Mass., who is not involved with the mission <em>(SN: 2/15/20)</em>. Since these asteroids would have originally come from farther out (say, the asteroid belt), they can tell us about the rocks going past Earth that can potentially hit us. “We’ll know our neighborhood better,” Burbine says.</p>



<h4>Dating a star</h4>



<p>It is notoriously difficult to measure <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/star-age-calculation-astronomy-life-cycle">the age of stars</a> (<em>SN: 7/23/21)</em>. “It’s not uncommon to have uncertainty of more than a billion years,” says Alessandro Savino, an astrophysicist at the University of California, Berkeley who is not involved with Gaia. Unlike brightness or location, age is not directly visible. Astronomers have to rely on theories of how stars evolve to predict ages from what they can measure.</p>



<p>If past versions of the Gaia survey were like a photograph of stars, the new release is like shifting the photograph from black and white to color. It provides a deeper look at hundreds of millions of stars by measuring their temperature, gravity and chemistry. “You imagine the star as this point in space, but then they have so many properties,” Spoto says. “That’s what Gaia is giving you.”</p>



<p>Although these kinds of measurements are far from new, they have never been collected in the Milky Way on such a scale before. Those data could provide more insight into how stars evolve. “We can improve the resolution of our clocks,” Savino says.&nbsp;</p>



<h4>Milky Way snacks</h4>



<p>Though it may seem unchanging, the Milky Way is actually gorging on a steady diet of smaller galaxies —it’s even in the process of eating one right now. But for decades, predictions of when and how these cosmic mergers happen have been at odds with evidence from our galaxy, says Bertrand Goldman, an astrophysicist at the International Space University in Strasbourg, France, who is not involved in the Gaia data release. &nbsp;“That has been controversial for a long time,” Goldman says, “but I think that Gaia will certainly shed light.”</p>



<p>The key is to be able to pick apart <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/giant-wave-gas-star-nursery-lurks-near-our-solar-system">different structures in the Milky Way</a> and see how old they are (<em>SN: 1/10/20)</em>. Gaia’s latest release helps in two ways: By mapping the chemistry of stars and by measuring their motion. Previous versions of the survey described how millions of stars were moving, but mostly in two dimensions. The new catalog quadruples the number of stars with full 3-D trajectories from 7 million to 33 million.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This has implications beyond our neighborhood. Most of the mass in the universe is contained in galaxies like the Milky Way, so knowing how our own galaxy works goes a long way to understanding space on the largest scales. And the more scientists understand the parts of galaxies they can see, the more they can learn about <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/dark-matter-milky-way-galaxy-central-bar-stars-slow-rotation">dark matter</a>, the mysterious substance that exerts gravity but doesn’t interact with light (<em>SN: 6/25/21)</em>.</p>



<p>Even as astronomers mine this latest dataset, they are already looking ahead to future treasure hunts. The next round is years off, but it is expected to enable the discovery of thousands of exoplanets, produce rare measurements of black holes and help astronomers clock how fast the universe is expanding. In part, this is because Gaia is designed to track the motion of objects in space, and that gets easier as more time passes. So Gaia’s observations can only get more powerful. “Like good wine, they age very, very well,” Savino says.</p>

Although these luminaries signed on to the mea culpa, there was no direct admission of the harm caused by these ill-advised practices.

Dr. Barlow and Dr. Steven C. Hayes were Past Presidents of ABCT in 1978-1979 and 1997-1998, respectively. <a href="https://stevenchayes.com/about/" target="_blank">Hayes</a> subsequently developed <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acceptance_and_commitment_therapy" target="_blank">Acceptance and Commitment Therapy</a> (ACT) and <a href="https://www.bu.edu/card/profile/david-h-barlow-ph-d/" target="_blank">Barlow</a> is known for his work on the treatment of anxiety disorders. <br /></p><p></p><p></p><p><br /></p><p><b>Sorry Seems to Be the Hardest Word</b><br /></p><p></p><p>I first learned about the ABCT apology on Twitter, via Lorenzo Lorenzo-Luaces, PhD (<a href="https://twitter.com/lluaces/status/1534936613012242432" target="_blank">@lluaces</a>) and Aaron Fisher (<a href="https://twitter.com/aaronjfisher/status/1534995049154367489">aaronjfisher</a>).</p><blockquote><p><a href="https://www.abct.org/latest-news/abct-apology-for-behavior-therapys-contribution-to-the-development-and-practice-of-sexual-orientation-and-gender-identity-and-expression-change-efforts-history-and-next-steps/" target="_blank">ABCT  Apology for Behavior Therapy’s Contribution to the Development and  Practice of Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity and Expression Change  Efforts</a><br /><br />The ABCT Board of Directors and past leadership have  released an apology for behavior therapy’s contributions to the  development and practice of  sexual orientation and gender identity and  expression change efforts [SOGIECEs].</p></blockquote><p></p><br /><p>More details are in the Full Apology <a href="https://www.abct.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Untitled-document-6.pdf" target="_blank">PDF</a>.</p><blockquote>...[ABCT] apologizes for our historic role in the development and use of so-called “conversion therapies,” practices that have caused untold harm to members of the sexual and gender minority (SGM) community for over 50 years. To this day, publications written by ABCT members – including members in prominent leadership roles – are used by anti-SGM activists to justify their ongoing use of these damaging so-called “therapies.” ABCT deeply regrets behavior therapists’ role in the creation, study, and use of these practices, and recognizes and accepts responsibility for the ways in which both our actions and inactions have harmed SGM people. ABCT recognizes it is time for us to document our history and legacy and say that we are truly sorry.<span style="color: #800180;"><b><sup>1</sup></b></span></blockquote><p><br />But documentation of this history and legacy is rather sketchy... Without naming names, the Apology cited the recent review of <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/epdf/10.1002/jaba.884" target="_blank">Capriotti and Donaldson (2022)</a>, which in turn asked “Why don’t behavior analysts do something?” about retracting the unethical paper of <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1311956/" target="_blank" title="Behavioral treatment of deviant sex-role behaviors in a male child">Rekers and Lovaas (1974)</a>.

Barlow sent a forthcoming book chapter from his 2016 retrospective, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Barlow-Neurotic-Paradox-Routledge-Library/dp/1138850799" target="_blank"><i>The Neurotic Paradox, Volume 1: Progress in Understanding and Treating Anxiety and Related Disorders</i></a>. A sort-of not-really apology appeared on p. 6-7:</p><blockquote>But it was also during this time [late 60s-early 70s] that I undertook what has come to be from my own personal point of view the most regrettable initiative in my clinical research career. Specifically ... I began treating and evaluating the effects of [covert sensitization]&nbsp; treatment in individuals with what came to be called paraphilias but what was then called sexual deviation (Barlow, 1974a). While our focus was mostly on pedophilia (e.g. Barlow, Leitenberg, &amp; Agras, 1969), the aggressive behavior of rapists (e.g. Abel, Barlow, Blanchard, &amp; Guild, 1977), and other paraphilias (e.g. Hayes, Brownell, &amp; Barlow, 1978), included in this series of studies were participants presenting with same-sex arousal patterns with consenting adults. (e.g., Barlow, Leitenberg, &amp; Agras, 1969). At that time homosexuality was considered a disorder in all systems of nosology and, under extreme pressures from society and the associated stigma, these individuals sought out treatment; so very few clinicians even gave it a second thought.

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/covid-19-nasal-vaccines-pfizer-moderna-fluenz-tetra-flumist">Nasal vaccines for COVID-19 offer hope and face hurdles</a></h4>

              
                <p>A few weeks ago, I was obsessed with my nose and throat. I was on a trip to Seattle to speak at a small, masks-required virology meeting about being a journalist during a pandemic. I went to graduate school there, so I was thrilled to see old friends and colleagues. But the irony that I was risking getting infected amid rising COVID-19 cases to get on a plane to talk with virologists about the pandemic didn’t escape me. I spent the whole week on high alert for the slightest hint of a sore throat or a runny nose. Despite masking, I worried that I’d get sick and be stuck thousands of miles from home or that I’d unknowingly pass the virus on to someone else.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Luckily, this story has a happy ending. I didn’t catch the coronavirus. None of my friends or former colleagues got sick. Although I didn’t escape completely unscathed; I did come down with a mystery, non-COVID cold that I suspect I caught from a friend’s baby. Still, the experience made me wonder ​​— what if I didn’t have to worry so much about becoming a disease spreader because there were COVID-19 vaccines that helped my body control the virus in my nose?</p>





<aside class="wp-block-sciencenews-inline-related-post alignleft"><h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/sign-up-for-e-mail-updates-on-the-coronavirus-outbreak">Sign up for e-mail updates on the latest coronavirus news and research</a></h4></aside>



<p>Researchers are working on vaccines that would hopefully do just that. You squirt these vaccines into your nostrils, rather than inject them into your arm muscle like the current COVID-19 shots. Sprayed up the nose, the vaccines teach our immune systems to fortify our nostrils against coronavirus, perhaps meaning we get less sick or making us less likely to transmit the virus to other people.</p>



<p>Jabs in the arm may not be as good at preventing transmission as nasal spray vaccines, some scientists suspect. The shots <em>are</em> better at building defenses that circulate in the blood or fluid that surrounds cells, which makes them great at protecting the lungs. And they have done what they are designed to do: <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/covid-coronavirus-vaccines-hospital-cases-rates-unvaccinated">curb severe disease and death</a> (<em>SN: 8/31/21</em>). <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/covid-19-second-booster-shot-vaccine-immune-system">Booster doses help fend off severe COVID-19</a> better than the first two shots — especially for older people, studies show (<em>SN: 4/29/22</em>). But even with death rates down, that doesn’t mean our fight with coronavirus is over. Waning immune defenses combined with slippery versions of the coronavirus that can evade parts of our immune systems leave vaccinated people susceptible to infection. So we still need additional protection.</p>



<p>A panel of experts advising the U.S. Food and Drug Administration will meet later this month to weigh in on whether we might need a vaccine update for the fall. Updated shots may indeed be on the horizon: Preliminary data from vaccine developer Moderna show that its latest vaccine, which includes both omicron and the original virus, <a href="https://investors.modernatx.com/news/news-details/2022/Moderna-Announces-Omicron-Containing-Bivalent-Booster-Candidate-mRNA-1273.214-Demonstrates-Superior-Antibody-Response-Against-Omicron/default.aspx">boosts the immune response against omicron</a> as well as other variants such as delta, the company announced on June 8.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And on June 7 the FDA advisory committee recommended that the agency authorize a new COVID-19 vaccine for emergency use. This one, developed by the company Novavax, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/covid-19-coronavirus-novavax-vaccine-results-south-africa-variant">is based on a traditional method</a> —&nbsp; showing the immune system purified viral proteins — which may be appealing to still unvaccinated people who are hesitant about the novel mRNA technology in Moderna’s and Pfizer’s shots (<em>SN: 1/28/21</em>). Other experts are working on vaccines that might hold up against an onslaught of variants, both present and future.&nbsp;</p>

<p>And then, there are the nasal spray vaccines. They could not only protect our lungs, but also the mucous membranes that line the upper regions of our respiratory tracts such as the nose. Such sprays would give us not only a motion detector ready to sense an intruder in an inner room of a building but also an alarm system that goes off the second the front door opens.</p>



<p>That type of alarm system isn’t a brand-new tool. For example, there is a nasal influenza vaccine available in the United States called FluMist, which teaches the body to recognize four different strains. And there is a similar one in Europe called Fluenz Tetra. Each flu virus included in these vaccines is weakened but can replicate in the body. The attenuated viruses grow best at<a href="https://www.cdc.gov/flu/prevent/nasalspray.htm"> cooler temperatures found in our noses</a>, not the warm environment of our lungs, a barrier that keeps them from making it to the lungs and causing influenza. But by taking off in the nose, replicating viruses kick off an immune response, so our bodies learn to set up reinforcements there.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Already<a href="https://www.thelancet.com/action/showPdf?pii=S2352-3964%2822%2900025-1"> roughly a dozen potential COVID-19 nasal vaccines have made it to clinical trials</a> around the world. One developed by a company called Altimmune was abandoned after <a href="https://ir.altimmune.com/news-releases/news-release-details/altimmune-announces-update-adcovidtm-phase-1-clinical-trial">early results showed the vaccine didn’t prompt a good immune response</a> in healthy participants. Others have<a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.05.16.492138v1"> shown promise when tested in animals</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The prospect of having nasal vaccines that may be able to curb transmission better than existing shots is understandably exciting. But these types of vaccines still have a way to go before hitting local pharmacies or doctors’ offices.</p>



<p>First, it’s crucial for the nasal vaccines to strike the right balance. Their sprays must be strong enough to provoke our immune systems, but still weak enough that there aren’t unwelcome symptoms or side effects. It’s also of course important to ensure the safety of vaccine candidates that include live, weakened viruses.&nbsp;</p>





<p>Some nasal vaccine candidates are similar to the influenza vaccine and include live, weakened viruses. Most of these viruses aren’t the coronavirus itself, but rather harmless-to-human viruses that sport one coronavirus protein for our bodies to recognize. Others may not need a virus to grow in the body to work. One team is developing a nasal spray that includes only the coronavirus spike protein, which helps the virus break into cells. That spike spray <a href="https://medicine.yale.edu/news-article/nasal-approach-to-covid-vaccination-gains-traction-at-yale/">could serve as a boost for people who received one of the mRNA vaccines</a>, coaxing important immune cells to come live in the nose and other parts of the respiratory tract. Once there, those immune cells would be poised to kick into high gear if the coronavirus invades.</p>



<p>Second, nasal sprays face the same problem as current COVID-19 vaccines. What happens when the virus evolves in ways that help it hide from our immune system? We’ve already seen the consequences of that thanks to the delta and omicron waves that raced around the globe. And from 2016 to 2018, FluMist <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/flu/prevent/nasalspray.htm">stumbled in the face of tweaked versions of some influenza viruses</a>. Experts recommended that people get a different type of flu shot in those seasons. Just as researchers are considering updating existing COVID-19 shots to better mimic the viral variants currently wreaking havoc, nasal vaccines may also need regular updating.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>If I had a choice, I would never catch coronavirus. But in the grand scheme of things, it’d be nice if a spray up my nose could drastically lower my chances of passing it on to someone else if I did get infected. If they make it to consumers, the nasal vaccines could make future COVID-19 waves much smaller than they are now. And after more than two years of navigating ever-larger waves, wouldn’t that be nice?</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/vortex-smoke-ring-light">Scientists created ‘smoke rings’ of light</a></h4>

              
                <p>Smoke rings are being seen in a new light.</p>



<p>Doughnut-shaped structures called vortex rings are sometimes seen swirling through fluids. Smokers can form them with their mouths, volcanoes can spit them out during eruptions and dolphins can blow them as bubble rings. Now, scientists can create the rings with light.</p>



<p>A standard vortex is <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/vortex-gets-tied-knots">an eddy</a> in a liquid or gas, like a whirlpool (<em>SN: 3/5/13</em>). Imagine taking that swirling eddy, stretching it out and bending it into a circle and attaching it end-to-end. That’s a vortex ring. These rings travel through the liquid or gas as they swirl — for example, smoke rings float through the air away from a smoker’s head. In <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41566-022-01013-y">the new vortex rings</a>, described June 2 in <em>Nature Photonics</em>, light behaves similarly: The flow of energy swirls as the ring moves.</p>





<p>Optics researcher Qiwen Zhan and colleagues started from a vortex tube, a hurricanelike structure they already knew how to create using laser light. The team used optics techniques to bend the tube into a circular shape, creating a vortex ring.</p>



<p>The light rings aren’t that different from smoke or bubble rings, says Zhan, of the University of Shanghai for Science and Technology. “That’s kind of cool.”</p>



<p>Zhan is interested in seeing whether scientists could create vortex rings out of electric current or a magnetic field. And further study of the light rings might help scientists better understand how topology — the geometry of doughnuts, knots and similar shapes — affects light and how it interacts with matter.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2022/06/10/heres-how-our-visual-system-decides-how-cute-a-baby-is/">Here’s how our visual system decides how cute a baby is</a></h4>

              
                <p><em>By</em>&nbsp;<a href="https://emmayoung.net/">Emma Young</a></p>



<p>What makes one baby seem cuter than another (parental bias aside)? Large and round eyes, a small nose and mouth, a high and protruding forehead, chubby cheeks and soft skin have all been associated with cuteness, not just in <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2011/07/07/men-are-as-motivated-by-cute-baby-faces-as-women/">babies</a> but <a href="https://www.sciencefocus.com/nature/why-do-we-find-puppies-so-cute/">puppies</a>, kittens, dolls and Japanese anime and manga characters. But now a <a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2022-53880-001">new paper</a> in <em>Emotion</em> suggests that another factor has an impact: the &#8220;spatial frequency&#8221; of what we see.</p>



<span id="more-46387"></span>



<p>Our visual system uses spatial frequencies to rapidly process variations in relative light and dark in an image. &#8220;Low&#8221; spatial frequencies convey coarse information — the location of a dark eye against pale skin, for example. &#8220;High&#8221; spatial frequencies convey fine detail such as edges. But other frequencies are important, too; research shows that medium spatial frequencies are most useful for recognising faces, for example. Spatial frequency (SF) processing is the basic mechanism for visual analysis, write Mengni Zhou at Okayama University, Japan, and colleagues. “Therefore understanding the effect of SFs is essential for a better understanding of the processing of cuteness,” they argue.</p>



<p>The team first asked 32 participants from Okayama University to rate the cuteness of 40 black and white images of infant faces (aged up to one). Using these ratings, the researchers assembled a set of four faces from the bottom cuteness quartile. They did the same for the second, third and top cuteness quartiles, generating a total of four sets. (Fourteen of the infants were identified as ‘Caucasian’, one ‘Asian’ and one ‘Indian’).  The team then manipulated the spatial frequency of each of the faces, generating four filtered versions, ranging from low to high SF. </p>

From <a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2022-53880-001">Zhou et al (2022)</a></figcaption></figure></div>


<p>In the next stage of the study, a fresh group of 30 students from the same university used a 7-point scale to rate each of these filtered images, as well as the originals, for cuteness.</p>



<p>As the team expected, the unfiltered original photos got higher cuteness ratings than their filtered versions. But within the filtered versions, some were seen as cuter than others.</p>



<p>The analysis showed that faces with the lowest SF always got the lowest cuteness ratings. When the team talked to participants after the study, some said that these faces looked “eyeless with dark empty orbits.” These versions were seen as “distasteful, even scary,” the team writes</p>



<p>In comparison with low SF, faces with medium and high SF got relatively high cuteness ratings. This is probably because the facial features associated with cuteness (small nose, chubby cheeks, etc) are more obvious at relatively high spatial frequencies, the team notes.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But when the cuteness of the <em>unfiltered</em> faces was high, the medium SF versions got better ratings than the high SF versions. This might relate to earlier findings that medium SFs are most important for facial recognition, the team suggests. &#8220;One possible explanation is that the processing mechanism of positive cuteness&#8221; — i.e. finding a baby’s face definitely cute — &#8220;is strongly related to face identity,&#8221; they suggest.</p>



<p>“In the future, eye tracking and neuroimaging studies are also necessary to verify these results and explore the mechanism of cuteness processing in depth,” they add. For now, though, the team argues that this work provides “direct evidence that the perception of infant facial cuteness is affected by SF information”.</p>



<p>It’s hard to see how this finding might have any real world impacts — except perhaps in the production of cartoon, manga and anime characters. My own kids enjoy manga and anime. I — no doubt like the participants in this study, who were all at a Japanese university — am well aware of <a href="https://www.ranker.com/list/cutest-anime-characters/anna-lindwasser">anime caricatures of cuteness</a>. But perhaps SF could be manipulated to influence our perceptions of a character’s cuteness, too. </p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/asteroid-ryugu-ryugu-hayabusa2-meteorite-sample-carbonaceous-chondrite">Samples of the asteroid Ryugu are scientists’ purest pieces of the solar system</a></h4>

              
                <p>Samples of the asteroid Ryugu are the most pristine pieces of the solar system that scientists have in their possession.</p>



<p>A new analysis of Ryugu material confirms the <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/asteroid-ryugu-texture-instant-coffee">porous rubble-pile asteroid</a> is rich in carbon and finds it is extraordinarily primitive (<em>SN: 3/16/20</em>). It is also a <a href="http://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.abn7850">member of a rare class of space rocks</a> known as CI-type, researchers report online June 9 in <em>Science</em>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Their analysis looked at material from the Japanese mission Hayabusa2, which collected 5.4 grams of dust and small rocks from <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/hayabusa2-touchdown-asteroid-ryugu-second-sample-subsurface">multiple locations</a> on the surface of Ryugu and <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/japan-hayabusa2-asteroid-dirt-sample-clues-early-solar-system">brought that material to Earth</a> in December 2020 (<em>SN: 7/11/19</em>; <em>SN: 12/7/20</em>). Using 95 milligrams of the asteroid’s debris, the researchers measured dozens of chemical elements in the sample and then compared abundances of several of those elements to those measured in rare meteorites classified as CI-type chondrites. Fewer than 10 meteorites found on Earth are CI chondrites.</p>





<p>This comparison confirmed Ryugu is a CI-type chondrite. But it also showed that unlike Ryugu, the meteorites appear to have been altered, or contaminated, by Earth’s atmosphere or even human handling over time. “The Ryugu sample is a much more fresh sample,” says Hisayoshi Yurimoto, a geochemist at Hokkaido University in Sapporo, Japan.</p>



<p>The researchers also measured the abundances of manganese-53 and chromium-53 in the asteroid and determined that melted water ice reacted with most of the minerals around 5 million years after the solar system’s start, altering those minerals, says Yurimoto. That water has since evaporated, but those altered minerals are still present in the samples. By studying them, the researchers can learn more about the asteroid’s history. &nbsp;</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/quantum-physics-machine-learning-google-computer">Quantum physics exponentially improves some types of machine learning</a></h4>

              
                <p>Machine learning can get a boost from quantum physics.</p>



<p>On certain types of machine learning tasks, <a href="http://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.abn7293">quantum computers have an exponential advantage</a> over standard computation, scientists report in the June 10 <em>Science</em>. The researchers proved that, according to quantum math, the advantage applies when using machine learning to understand quantum systems. And the team showed that the advantage holds up in real-world tests.</p>



<p>“People are very excited about the potential of using quantum technology to improve our learning ability,” says theoretical physicist and computer scientist Hsin-Yuan Huang of Caltech. But it wasn’t entirely clear if machine learning could benefit from quantum physics in practice.</p>





<p>In certain machine learning tasks, scientists attempt to glean information about a quantum system — say a molecule or a group of particles — by performing repeated experiments, and analyzing data from those experiments to learn about the system. </p>



<p>Huang and colleagues studied several such tasks. In one, scientists aim to discern properties of the quantum system, such as the position and momentum of particles within. Quantum data from multiple experiments could be input into a quantum computer’s memory, and the computer would process the data jointly to learn the quantum system’s characteristics.</p>



<p>The researchers proved theoretically that doing the same characterization with standard, or classical, techniques would require exponentially more experiments in order to learn the same information. Unlike a classical computer, a quantum computer can exploit entanglement — ethereal quantum linkages — to better analyze the results of multiple experiments.</p>



<p>But the new work goes beyond just the theoretical. “It’s crucial to understand if this is realistic, if this is something we could see in the lab or if this is just theoretical,” says Dorit Aharonov of Hebrew University in Jerusalem, who was not involved with the research.</p>



<p>So the researchers tested machine learning tasks with <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/google-quantum-computer-supremacy-claim">Google’s quantum computer</a>, Sycamore (<em>SN: 10/23/19</em>). Rather than measuring a real quantum system, the team used simulated quantum data, and analyzed it using either quantum or classical techniques.</p>



<p>Quantum machine learning won out there, too, even though Google’s quantum computer is noisy, meaning errors can slip into calculations. Eventually, scientists plan to build quantum computers that can <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/quantum-computers-hype-supremacy-error-correction-problems">correct their own errors</a> (<em>SN: 6/22/20</em>). But for now, even without that error correction, quantum machine learning prevailed.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/antarctic-glaciers-antarctica-pine-island-melting-climate-change-global-warming">Ancient penguin bones reveal unprecedented shrinkage in key Antarctic glaciers</a></h4>

              
                <p>Antarctica’s Pine Island and Thwaites glaciers are losing ice more quickly than they have at any time in the last few thousand years, ancient penguin bones and limpet shells suggest.</p>



<p>Scientists are worried that the glaciers, two of Antarctica’s fastest-shrinking ones, are in the process of unstable, runaway retreat. By <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41561-022-00961-y">reconstructing the history of the glaciers</a> using the old bones and shells, researchers wanted to find out whether these glaciers have ever been smaller than they are today.</p>





<p>“If the ice has been smaller in the past, and did readvance, that shows that we’re not necessarily in runaway retreat” right now, says glacial geologist Brenda Hall of the University of Maine in Orono. The new result, described June 9 in <em>Nature Geoscience,</em> “doesn’t give us any comfort,” Hall says. “We can’t refute the hypothesis of a runaway retreat.”</p>



<p>Pine Island and Thwaites glaciers sit in a broad ocean basin shaped like a bowl, deepening toward the middle. This makes <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/climate-thwaites-glacier-under-ice-shelf-risks-warm-water">the ice vulnerable to warm currents</a> of dense, salty water that hug the ocean floor (<em>SN: 4/9/21</em>). Scientists have speculated that as the glaciers retreat  farther inland, they could <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/antarctica-thwaites-glacier-ice-shelf-collapse-climate-5-years">tip into an irreversible collapse</a> (<em>SN: 12/13/21</em>). &nbsp;That collapse could play out over centuries and raise the sea level by roughly a meter.</p>

<p>To reconstruct how the glaciers have changed over thousands of years, the researchers turned to old penguin bones and shells, collected by Scott Braddock, a glacial geologist in Hall’s lab, during a research cruise in 2019 on the U.S. icebreaker <em>Nathaniel B. Palmer</em>.</p>



<p>One afternoon, Braddock clambered from a bobbing inflatable boat onto the barren shores of Lindsey 1 — one of a dozen or more rocky islands that sit roughly 100 kilometers from where Pine Island Glacier terminates in the ocean. As he climbed the slope, his boots slipped over rocks covered in penguin guano and dotted with dingy white feathers. Then, he came upon a series of ridges — rocks and pebbles that were piled up by waves during storms thousands of years before — that marked ancient shorelines.</p>



<p>Twelve thousand years ago, just as the last ice age was ending, this island would have been entirely submerged in the ocean. But as nearby glaciers shed billions of metric tons of ice, the removal of that weight allowed Earth’s crust to spring up like a bed mattress — pushing Lindsey 1 and other nearby islands out of the water, a few millimeters per year.</p>



<p>As Lindsey 1 rose, a series of shorelines formed on the edges of the island — and then were lifted, one after another, out of reach of the waves. By measuring the ages and heights of those stranded shorelines, the researchers could tell how quickly the island had risen. Because the rate of uplift is determined by the amount of ice being lost from nearby glaciers, this would reveal how quickly Pine Island and Thwaites glaciers had retreated — and whether they had gotten smaller than they are today and then readvanced.</p>



<p>Braddock dug into the pebbly ridges, collecting ancient cone-shaped limpet shells and marble-sized fragments of penguin bones deposited when the shorelines formed. Back in Maine, he and his colleagues radiocarbon dated those objects to estimate the ages of the shorelines. Ultimately, the researchers dated nearly two dozen shorelines, spread across several islands in the region.</p>



<p>These dates showed that the oldest and highest beach formed 5,500 years ago. Since that time, up until the last few decades, the islands have risen at a steady rate of about 3.5 millimeters per year. This is far slower than the 20 to 40 millimeters per year that the land around Pine Island and Thwaites is currently rising, suggesting that the rate of ice loss from nearby glaciers has skyrocketed due to the onset of rapid human-caused warming, after thousands of years of relative stability.</p>



<p>“We’re going into unknown territory,” Braddock says. “We don’t have an analog to compare what’s going on today with what happened in the past.”</p>



<p>Slawek Tulaczyk, a glaciologist at the University of California, Santa Cruz, sees the newly dated shorelines as “an important piece of information.” But he cautions against overinterpreting the results. While these islands are 100 kilometers from Pine Island and Thwaites, they are less than 50 kilometers from several smaller glaciers — and changes in these closer glaciers might have obscured whatever was happening at Pine Island and Thwaites long ago. He suspects that Pine Island and Thwaites could still have retreated and then readvanced a few dozen kilometers: “I don’t think this study settles it.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/robotic-finger-human-skin-self-healing">Scientists grew living human skin around a robotic finger</a></h4>

              
                <p>The Terminator may be one step closer to reality.</p>



<p>Researchers at the University of Tokyo have built a robotic finger that, much like Arnold Schwarzenegger’s titular cyborg assassin, is <a href="https://www.cell.com/matter/fulltext/S2590-2385(22)00239-9">covered in living human skin</a>. The goal is to someday build robots that look like real people — albeit for more altruistic applications.</p>



<p>Super realistic-looking robots could more seamlessly interact with humans in medical care and service industries, say biohybrid engineer Shoji Takeuchi and his colleagues June 9 in <em>Matter</em>. (Whether cyborgs masked in living tissue would be more congenial or creepy is probably in the eye of the beholder.)</p>





<p>To cover the finger in skin, Takeuchi and colleagues submerged the robotic digit in a blend of collagen and human skin cells called dermal fibroblasts. The mixture settled into a base layer of skin, or dermis, covering the finger. The team then poured a liquid containing human keratinocyte cells onto the finger, which formed an outer skin layer, or epidermis. After two weeks, skin covering the finger measured a few millimeters thick — comparable to the thickness of human skin.</p>



<p>The lab-made skin was strong and stretchy enough to withstand the robotic finger bending. It could also heal itself: When researchers made a small cut on the robotic finger and covered it with a collagen bandage, the skin’s fibroblast cells merged the bandage with the rest of the skin within a week.</p>

<p>“This is very interesting work and an important step forward in the field,” says Ritu Raman, an MIT engineer who also builds machines with living components. “Biological materials are appealing because they can dynamically sense and adapt to their environments.” For instance, she’d like to see a future version of the living robot skin embedded with nerve cells to make robots more aware of their surroundings.</p>



<p>But a robot can’t wear this lab-grown skin suit out and about just yet, Raman notes. The skin-covered robotic finger spent most of its time soaking in sugar, amino acids and other ingredients that skin cells need to survive. A Terminator or other cyborg wearing this skin would have to bathe often in a broth of nutrients or use some other complex skin care routine.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2022/06/09/knowing-about-racial-disparities-in-covid-outcomes-reduces-white-americans-concern-and-support-for-safety-precautions/">Knowing about racial disparities in Covid outcomes reduces White Americans’ concern and support for safety precautions</a></h4>

              
                <p><em>By guest blogger</em>&nbsp;<a href="https://twitter.com/E_Barratt">Emma L. Barratt</a></p>



<p>In many countries, including the United Kingdom and United States, people from non-White communities have been hardest hit by Covid-19. Those from non-White communities generally have less access to good healthcare, are more likely to be essential workers, and are more likely to die from Covid than their White counterparts.</p>



<p>And though many of us are aware of this, <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S027795362200257X">new research</a> suggests that within the White demographic, simply hearing the reasons for these facts may be enough to make Covid seem like less of a threat, and reduce support for public health measures.</p>



<span id="more-46380"></span>



<p>In the first study, the team from the University of Georgia, US, looked at how White US residents’ perception of Covid racial disparities was related to their fear of Covid and support for Covid-centric safety precautions.</p>



<p>In September 2020, the researchers asked 498 White adult participants across 48 US states whether they felt White people or people of colour were more impacted in terms of infection rates and deaths. The team also probed participants’ knowledge of systemic factors that created said disparities, asking the extent to which they agreed with several factual statements, such as “people of colour in the U.S. are less likely to have access to drive-through testing services (relative to White people), which increases the spread of COVID-19 among people of colour”.</p>



<p>The participants were then presented with several measures in a randomised order, which looked at their fear of Covid, support for safety precautions (such as wearing a mask and social distancing), intentions to socially distance from those of different races, and racial attitudes. Participants also provided demographic data.</p>



<p>Somewhat in line with the team’s expectations, those that perceived greater Covid disparities between races reported less fear of the disease, though no less endorsement of Covid-related public health measures. In contrast, those with more knowledge of the systemic factors responsible for these disparities showed increased fear of Covid, as well as more support for Covid-related safety precautions. Perhaps unsurprisingly, those who were more conservative were less likely to support Covid public health measures.</p>



<p>The team took these findings further in their second study, investigating whether exposure to information about Covid racial disparities might move the needle in similar ways. For this leg of their research, 1,505 newly recruited White participants were randomly presented with one of three articles. Two of these referred to racial disparities in Covid outcomes, only one of which provided an explanation: that these disparities were the product of long-standing healthcare inequalities. A control article didn’t mention racial disparities at all. Participants then completed the same measures as in study one, with the addition of a measure of empathy.</p>



<p>This study again showed that having more knowledge about racial disparities led to less concern about Covid. However, this effect seemed to be strongest for the group presented with information about the role of systemic issues in producing these disparities. Reduced concern in this group in turn led them to show less support for safety precautions. In essence, it seems as though the more the participants knew, the less they cared.</p>



<p>The authors speculate that explaining how Covid racial disparities are a product of enduring health inequalities affecting non-White communities may have made White participants feel that they were unlikely to be similarly affected. This psychological distance may be part of the problem.</p>



<p>In their paper, the team draws lines between several psychological factors that may also contribute to this surprising outcome. Firstly, when faced with a threatening health situation, people are likely to contrast their own situation with that of people more at risk as a method of coping, drawing distance between the two for comfort. Perceiving a group and their situation as psychologically distant from one’s own (i.e. an out-group rather than an in-group) can make threats facing other groups also seem distant from oneself, and therefore less of a threat. The combination of these factors is likely to leave White people with reduced empathy for members of those at-risk racial minorities, while also reducing engagement with public health precautions.</p>



<p>Future efforts to create practical strategies and programs which lessen these particular psychological quirks may prove important in future public health efforts. In the meantime, the authors believe that additional care should be taken when reporting on racial disparities during the pandemic, as fuelling this phenomenon may perpetuate inequalities and have damaging effects on public health behaviour.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/mental-health-care-workers-nonviolent-police-calls-crime-denver-star">How having health care workers handle nonviolent police calls may impact crime</a></h4>

              
                <p>For the last two years, a person acting erratically in downtown Denver has likely first encountered unarmed health care workers rather than police. That shift stems from the rollout of a program known as Support Team Assisted Response, or STAR, which sends a mental health clinician and paramedic to respond to certain 911 calls about nonviolent behavior.</p>



<p>The program, and others like it, aim to defuse the tensions that can arise when police officers confront civilians in distress. Critics of these experimental programs have suggested that such reduced police involvement could allow crime to flourish. Now, researchers have found that during its pilot phase, <a href="http://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.abm2106">the STAR program did not appear to lead to more violent crime</a>. And reports of minor crimes substantially decreased, the researchers conclude June 8 in <em>Science Advances</em>.</p>





<p>Much of that reduction occurred because the health responders <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/police-racial-bias-data-missing-flawed-nonevents">do not issue citations</a> or make arrests <em>(SN: 12/18/21</em>). But even that reduction in reported crime is beneficial, says economist Thomas Dee of Stanford University. “That person is getting health care instead of being arrested.”</p>



<p>Following the death of George Floyd at the hands of a white police officer and the subsequent rise of the Black Lives Matter movement in the summer of 2020, cities throughout the country have been rolling out programs like STAR. “We cannot police our way out of every social problem,” says Temitope Oriola, a sociologist at the University of Alberta in Edmonton, Canada. But so far there have been <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/police-reform-why-little-evidence-data-body-cameras-implicit-bias">few studies</a> of these programs’ effects on crime, let alone on the reduction of violence between police and the public (<em>SN: 7/9/20</em>).</p>



<p>Dee and Jayme Pyne, a sociologist also at Stanford, looked at the STAR program’s impact on crime reports. The duo investigated the program&#8217;s pilot phase, which ran from June to November 2020 and encompassed eight of the city’s 36 police precincts. Police officers and 911 operators in those eight precincts redirected calls for minor and non-dangerous complaints to STAR providers. These calls included concerns about trespassing, indecent exposure, intoxication and similar low-level offenses. During the six-month pilot, STAR providers responded to 748 calls, averaging roughly six incidents per eight-hour shift.</p>



<p>Dee and Pyne analyzed criminal offenses in all 36 precincts from December 2019 to November 2020. They then compared the change in crime rates in the eight precincts receiving STAR services with the change in crime rates in the other 28 precincts. The rate of violent crime remained unchanged across the board, including in the precincts where the STAR program was active, the researchers found. But there was a 34 percent drop in reports of minor offenses in the STAR precincts, from an average of about 84 offenses per month in each district to an average of about 56 citations.</p>



<p>The data also suggest that the actual level of minor crimes and complaints dropped too — that is, the drop wasn’t just due to a lack of reporting, the researchers say. Prior to the pilot, minor offenses in the eight precincts receiving STAR services resulted in an average of 1.4 citations per incident. So having health care workers rather than police respond to 748 such calls should generate roughly 1,000 fewer citations, the authors calculate. Instead, citations dropped by almost 1,400. Providing people in crisis with access to health services may be preventing them from reoffending, Dee says.</p>



<p>Research into these sorts of programs is crucial, says Michael Vermeer, a justice policy researcher with the RAND Corporation, a public policy research organization headquartered in Santa Monica, Calif. &nbsp;But he cautions against drawing firm conclusions from a single study launched at the onset of the COVID-19 crisis, which dramatically changed crime rates and patterns across the country. “They just got confounded by the pandemic,” Vermeer says.</p>



<p>Dee agrees that he and other researchers now need to replicate this study across more cities, and also scale up in Denver. The city has since expanded the STAR program beyond the initial pilot.</p>



<p>Even if researchers eventually find that STAR and similar programs don’t budge crime rates much, that doesn’t mean that the programs are unsuccessful, says sociologist Brenden Beck of the University of Colorado Denver. He points to the potential to save taxpayer dollars. Dee and Pyne estimate that a single offense processed through STAR costs about $150, compared with the roughly $600 it costs to process one through the criminal justice system.</p>



<p>What’s more, helping people having nonviolent mental health crises get help and stay out of jail lets these individuals hold onto their jobs and stay present in their family members’ lives, Beck says. “I would hope we as a research community move on to study the benefit of these programs not just in terms of crime but also in terms of human welfare.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/chemistry-pigments-paint-arsenic-yellow-rose-mignon-still-life">A pigment’s shift in chemistry robbed a painted yellow rose of its brilliance</a></h4>

              
                <p>The fading of a once-vibrant yellow rose reveals how the ravages of time and chemical alteration can dampen the visual power of a painting<em>.</em></p>



<p>Most of the flowers in Abraham Mignon’s 17th century painting <em>Still Life with Flowers and a Watch </em>seem to leap off the canvas. But one yellow rose, painted with arsenic sulfide–based orpiment pigment, is a flat, jarring element. That wasn’t Mignon’s intention: The rose lost its luster due to <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.abn6344">the chemical transformation of some of its original bright pigment into colorless lead arsenates</a>, researchers report June 8 in <em>Science Advances</em>.</p>





<p>Paintings conservator Nouchka De Keyser of the Rijksmuseum in Amsterdam and colleagues analyzed the rose using <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/marie-antoinette-letters-ink-analysis-hidden-words-censor">noninvasive techniques including X-ray fluorescence imaging</a> and X-ray powder diffraction (<em>SN: 10/1/21</em>). The team first mapped the lingering traces of arsenic, lead, calcium and other chemical elements in the layers of paint to reveal how Mignon carefully layered paint to create a nearly three-dimensional rose out of light and shadow.</p>



<p>The analyses also revealed two newer crystals on the rose containing both lead and arsenic. Called mimetite and schultenite, the crystals are the product of a series of chemical reactions. First, the reaction of orpiment with light created a highly mobile type of arsenic called arsenolite. That mobilized arsenolite then found its way to an underlying layer of lead white paint and chemically reacted with it to produce the mimetite and schultenite. The crystals lack the bright color of the orpiment — instead, they are colorless and flatten the flower’s appearance.</p>

<p>Science can’t turn back the clock on the chemical transformation to restore the rose’s erstwhile glory — that’s a one-way street. But digital reconstructions made using similar techniques as in the new study could offer several benefits and not just to scientists and art historians, De Keyser says. Not only can such reconstructions reveal now-faded elements in other paintings — they might also appear in museums, allowing visitors a ghostly glimpse of a painting’s true past.</p>

                <p><em>By </em>Emily Reynolds</p>



<p>A new study has cast doubt on historic research suggesting that the season or month of someone’s birth is associated with an increased risk of certain mental health conditions.</p>



<p>The <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-022-10892-8">paper</a>, published in<em> Scientific Reports, </em>looks at symptoms of anxiety and depression among more than 70,000 older adults in Europe. And it finds that there is no relationship between when they were born and the likelihood that they experience anxiety or depression.</p>



<span id="more-46363"></span>



<p>A number of past studies have found a link between season of birth and mental health diagnoses: research <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8885042/#:~:text=Results%3A%20'Process'%20schizophrenia%2C,was%205.8%25%20for%20bipolar%20disorder.">has linked bipolar disorder and schizophrenia with birth month</a>, for example. Researchers have suggested that such links could arise from nutrient intake and disease exposure varying across the course of the year. However, evidence has been mixed and more recent studies have suggested that confounding factors, particularly socioeconomic background, has more to do with these diagnoses than month of birth.</p>



<p>To see whether season of birth does make a difference to mental health, the team used data from a survey of 72,370 older adults from across Europe, who had been asked questions on their health. Information gathered for this study included their month and season of birth (winter, spring, summer or autumn), and the extent to which they experienced symptoms of depression or anxiety.</p>



<p>Overall, there was no significant relationship between participants’ month of birth and symptoms of depression or anxiety. There was some variability in some countries — for example in Hungary and Poland, depressive symptoms fluctuated a little depending on birth month, and in the Czech Republic the same was true of anxiety symptoms — but, on the whole, there was no systematic pattern.</p>



<p>The team also compared younger and older participants (below and above the ages of 65), male and female participants, and those from different regions of Europe. And again, there was no meaningful effect of month of birth, regardless of how participants were split up.</p>



<p>As noted, previous research had suggested that season of birth had a strong association with mental health. This has largely been attributed to the impact of climate, differences in sunlight and vitamin D exposure, nutrition and other factors. The team suggests that an improvement in access to healthy food — and an understanding of the nutrients pregnant women and children need — may therefore be able to explain why there was no link between month of birth and mental health symptoms in this study.</p>



<p>The study, therefore, indicates that season of birth may not be a good predictor of mental health later in life. However, the social and environmental factors that potentially drove the links previously found between season of birth and mental health, such as nutrition and maternal health, are still worth considering when it comes to the physical and mental health of whole families.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/mosquito-sleep-deprivation-blood-disease">Mosquitoes prefer dozing over dining when they are sleep-deprived</a></h4>

              
                <p>Turns out there <em>is</em> rest for the wicked: Sleepy mosquitoes are more likely to catch up on missed z’s than drink blood, a new study finds.</p>



<p>Most people are familiar with the aftermath of a poor night’s sleep. Insects also suffer; for instance, drowsy honeybees struggle to perform their signature waggle dance, and weary fruit flies show signs of memory loss. In the case of sleep-deprived mosquitoes, they <a href="https://journals.biologists.com/jeb/article-abstract/225/11/jeb244032/275550/Behavioral-and-postural-analyses-establish-sleep">give up valuable time for feeding in favor of sleeping overtime</a>, researchers report June 1 in <em>Journal of Experimental Biology</em>.</p>





<p>The preference for dozing over dining is surprising given that “we know that mosquitoes love blood a lot,” says Oluwaseun Ajayi, a disease ecologist at the University of Cincinnati.</p>



<p>Scientists have long been interested in mosquitoes’ <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/cracking-body-clock-code-wins-trio-nobel-prize">circadian rhythms</a>, the internal clock that determines their sleep and awake times (<em>SN: 10/2/17</em>). Knowing when a mosquito is awake —&nbsp;and biting — is important for understanding and limiting disease transmission. For instance, malaria, often transmitted by nocturnal mosquitoes, is kept under control by slinging netting around beds. But new research suggests that <a href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2104282119">mosquitoes that feed during the day may also spread</a> the disease.</p>



<p>It’s challenging to study sleeping bloodsuckers in the lab. That’s partly because awake mosquitoes are aroused by the presence of a meal — the experimenter. And when mosquitoes do fall asleep, they look rather similar to peers that are merely resting to conserve energy.&nbsp;</p>



<p>That’s the tricky — and often species-specific — question: “How can you tell [when] an insect is sleeping?” says Samuel Rund, a mosquito circadian biologist at the University of Notre Dame in Indiana who was not involved in the research.</p>



<p>One way to tell is by tracking the insect’s behavior. So Ajayi and colleagues watched mosquitoes sleep. The team focused on three species known to carry diseases, including malaria: <em>Aedes aegypti</em>, which are active during the day; <em>Culex pipiens</em>, which prefer dusk; and the nocturnal <em>Anopheles stephensi</em>. The mosquitoes were left alone in a room in small enclosures, where the team used cameras and infrared sensors to spy on them.</p>



<p>After about two hours, the mosquitoes appeared to nod off. Their abdomens lowered to the ground and their hind legs drooped, the footage showed. As time went on, <em>C. pipiens </em>and <em>A. aegypti</em> showed a reduced response when the experimenter walked in the room, suggesting a tasty smell was less likely to wake those species when in a deep sleep. Taken together, the change in posture, periods of inactivity and lower arousal were determined to identify a snoozing mosquito.</p>



<p>What started as a relaxing experiment for the mosquitoes quickly changed gears. The insects were placed in clear tubes that received vibration pulses every few minutes, preventing them from falling into deep sleep. After four to 12 hours of this sleep deprivation, the team mimicked the presence of a host with a pad of heated artificial sweat. In another experiment, a plucky human volunteer offered up a leg to be fed on for five minutes by sleep-deprived and well-rested <em>A. aegypti </em>in batches of 10 insects.</p>



<p>In both cases, the mosquitoes that had had a full night’s rest were much more likely to land on the host than those that had been deprived of sleep. And the leg exposed to sleepy mosquitoes fared much better than when it was exposed to the control group: In eight tests, on average 77 percent of the well-rested mosquitoes went for a blood meal, compared with only 23 percent of sleepy mosquitoes.</p>



<p>The findings, Rund says, open avenues for research into controlling mosquito populations and reducing disease using the insects’ circadian rhythms.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2022/06/open-code-at-plos-computational-biology/">The impact of a year of Open Code at PLOS Computational Biology</a></h4>

              
                <p>Written by <a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/author/lmorton/">Lindsay Morton</a></p>



<p>A year ago, in response to <a href="https://osf.io/f73a6/">community desire</a> for a strong position on code sharing, and in acknowledgement of the <a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2022/05/uphold-the-code/">immense value</a> that code adds to the scientific literature, <em>PLOS Computational Biology</em> introduced a new <a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2021/03/supporting-community-needs-with-an-enhanced-code-policy-on-plos-computational-biology/">code-sharing policy</a>. The policy requires that any code supporting a publication be shared (unless there are ethical or legal restrictions that prevent sharing).</p>



<p>Now, a new <a href="https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1010193">editorial</a> reports the results of an analysis of code-sharing behavior at the journal both before and after the policy implementation. The investigation found that, &ldquo;the rate of code sharing for research articles published in <em>PLOS Computational Biology</em> before the policy was implemented was 53% in 2019 and 61% in 2020. This rose to 73% for research articles published in 2021, which includes a high proportion of research articles that were submitted before the policy was implemented.&rdquo; When looking only at articles submitted after the introduction of the policy, the code-sharing rate is 87%. For comparison, it is estimated that more than 99.5% of research articles published in the journal between 2019 and 2022 generated code that supported the research presented.</p>

<p>This remarkable increase demonstrates the efficacy of a policy-based approach to code-sharing. &ldquo;These results show that the mandatory code sharing policy is such a great fit for the computational biology community. Many researchers were already showing great commitment to openness and transparency by voluntarily sharing code before the policy came into effect and now the policy just helps to cement this as the norm for the field.&rdquo; said Lauren Cadwallader, Open Research Manager at PLOS and one of the authors of the editorial.&nbsp;</p>

<p><a href="https://bookshop.org/a/21798/9780062951519">The Rise and Reign of the Mammals</a><br><em>Steve Brusatte</em><br><em>Mariner Books, $29.99</em></p>



<p>In my opinion, the most satisfying science documentary TV series ever made was a 1970s British production called <em>Connections</em>. Hosted by impish historian James Burke, wearing bell-bottoms and thick-framed tortoiseshell glasses, each episode revealed how one small innovation from earlier human civilizations led to another and then another and another, culminating in the invention of some ultramodern (for the 1970s) technology.</p>



<p>Watching these pieces of the past come together was deeply gratifying, if not a little dizzying. The present is so familiar that it feels inevitable. But it was striking to see modern civilization, even modern humans, in context, to recognize how all that we are now actually hinges on countless moments of invention, improvement and experimentation in the deep past.</p>





<p>I had a similar reaction to <em>The Rise and Reign of the Mammals</em>, paleontologist Steve Brusatte’s sweeping history of the animals that have, for the moment, inherited the Earth. Moving generally forward in time, the book describes how the mammalian line progressively acquired a range of features that have come to define what a mammal is.</p>



<p>Some of the moments of evolutionary invention that led to what we now think of as a mammal are remarkably subtle. There’s the hard roof of the mouth that created a dedicated airway to the lungs, allowing mammal ancestors to eat and breathe at the same time. There’s the change from a spine that bends from left to right (which produces the classically reptilian side-to-side gait) to one that enables bending up and down, which ultimately allowed mammals to take in more oxygen as they moved, helping them run faster. And there’s the variety of tooth shapes — incisors, canines, premolars and molars — that made it possible for mammals to eat many kinds of food. A reptile, by contrast, tends to have just one tooth type.</p>



<p>Some mammalian characteristics are very familiar: milk production, warm-bloodedness, hair. But there’s one less–well-known evolutionary advance that was in its humble way quite profound, setting “us apart from amphibians, reptiles, and birds,” Brusatte writes. It’s a <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/flexible-bone-helps-mammals-chew-dates-back-jurassic-period">joint in the jaw that makes chewing possible</a> (<em>SN: 8/17/19, p. 8</em>). The ability to chew was “a major evolutionary turning point,” he writes. “It triggered a domino chain of changes to mammalian feeding, intelligence, and reproduction.”</p>





<p>Brusatte also describes a second small, curious adaptation: the transformation of two bones in the reptile jaw, which migrated to the inner ear to become two members of a famous trio, the hammer and anvil (the third is the stirrup). These inner ear bones are the basis for yet another key mammalian feature: <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/ancient-critter-may-shed-light-when-mammals-middle-ear-evolved">the ability to hear a wide range of frequencies</a>, particularly in the upper register (<em>SN Online: 12/6/19</em>).</p>



<p>The story of the Age of Mammals is often told as the flip side to the dinosaurs’ demise. But the fossil record reveals that mammals were hardly newcomers: They arose around the same time as the dinosaurs, over 200 million years ago. Even during the Age of Dinosaurs, “in the smaller and hidden niches, it was already the Age of Mammals,” Brusatte writes. “Mammals were <em>better</em> than the dinosaurs at being small.”</p>



<p>Within just a few hundred thousand years of the asteroid impact that wiped out all nonbird dinos some 66 million years ago, mammals moved in to fill the vacancy, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/fossils-capture-mammals-recovery-after-dinosaur-killing-asteroid">rapidly getting a lot bigger</a>, ballooning from, say, mouse-sized to beaver-sized (<em>SN: 12/7/19, p. 32</em>). Pretty soon, they got a lot smarter too. In a geologic blink — a scant 10 million years — <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/mammal-big-bodies-small-brains-dinosaur-extinction-fossils">mammals’ brains caught up with their brawn</a>, and then the Age of Mammals was off to the races (<em>SN: 5/7/22 &amp; 5/21/22, p. 18</em>).</p>



<p>Paleontology narratives often require refocusing a story’s lens in a way that can be jarring, zooming out to encompass Earth-wide climate cataclysms and mass extinctions and then in again to describe tiny bones and obscure species. Brusatte, though, is a nimble storyteller and he’s chosen an engrossing story to tell.</p>



<p>As a science writer, I often find myself focusing on minute advances, studying tiny threads. So it’s satisfying to sit back and admire the full tapestry as presented in <em>The Rise and Reign of the Mammals</em>. Reading this book reminded me what I most enjoy about geology, paleontology and the evolution of life on Earth: This planet has got some epic stories.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/zircon-earthquake-gemstone-history-chemistry">Ancient zircons offer insights into earthquakes of the past</a></h4>

              
                <p>Earthquakes have rocked the planet for eons. Studying the quakes of old could help scientists better understand modern tremors, but tools to do such work are scarce.</p>



<p>Enter zircons. Researchers used the gemstones to home in on the temperatures reached within a fault during earthquakes millions of years ago. The method offers insights into the intensity of long-ago quakes, and could <a href="https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/2021GC010291">improve understanding of how today’s tremors release energy</a>, the researchers report in the April <em>Geochemistry, Geophysics, Geosystems</em>.</p>





<p>“The more we understand about the past, the more we can understand what might happen in the future,” says Emma Armstrong, a thermochronologist at Utah State University in Logan.</p>



<p>Armstrong and colleagues focused on California’s Punchbowl Fault. That now-quiet portion of the larger San Andreas Fault was probably active between 1 million to 10 million years ago, Armstrong says.</p>



<p>Heat from friction is generated in a fault when it slips and triggers an earthquake. Previous analyses of preserved organic material suggested that temperatures within the Punchbowl Fault peaked between 465° Celsius and 1065° C. The researchers suspected that zircons in rocks from the fault could narrow that broad window.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/ancient-zircon-plate-tectonics-subduction-earth">Zircons</a> often contain the radioactive chemical elements uranium and thorium, which decay to helium at a predictable rate (<em>SN: 5/2/22</em>)<em>.</em> That helium then builds up in the crystals. But when a zircon is heated past a temperature threshold — the magnitude of which depends on the zircon’s composition — the accumulated helium escapes.</p>



<p>Measuring the amounts of the three elements in zircons from the fault suggests that the most intense earthquake generated temperatures lower than 800° C. That roughly halves the range previously reported. The finding provides clues to the amount of heat released by quakes, something difficult to measure for modern tremors because they often occur at great depths.</p>



<p>Armstrong plans to continue studying zircons, in the hopes of finding more ways to exploit them for details about ancient quakes.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/chicken-domestication-bones-origin-asia-rice-fields-exotic-animals">A new origin story for domesticated chickens starts in rice fields 3,500 years ago</a></h4>

              
                <p>It turns out that chicken and rice may have always gone together, from the birds’ initial domestication to tonight’s dinner.</p>



<p>In two new studies, scientists lay out a potential story of chicken’s origins. This poultry tale begins surprisingly recently <a href="https://www.pnas.org/cgi/doi/10.1073/pnas.2121978119">in rice fields planted by Southeast Asian farmers</a> around 3,500 years ago, zooarchaeologist Joris Peters and colleagues report. From there, the birds were transported westward not as food but as exotic or culturally revered creatures, the team suggests June 6 in the <em>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences</em>.</p>





<p>“Cereal cultivation may have acted as a catalyst for chicken domestication,” says Peters, of Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich.</p>



<p>The domesticated fowl then arrived in Mediterranean Europe <a href="https://doi.org/10.15184/aqy.2021.90">no earlier than around 2,800 years ago</a>, archaeologist Julia Best of Cardiff University in Wales and colleagues report June 6 in <em>Antiquity</em>. The birds appeared in northwest Africa between 1,100 and 800 years ago, the team says.</p>



<p>Researchers have debated where and when chickens (<em>Gallus gallus domesticus</em>) originated for more than 50 years. India’s Indus Valley, northern China and Southeast Asia have all been touted as domestication centers. Proposed dates for chickens’ first appearance have mostly ranged from around 4,000 to 10,500 years ago. A 2020 genetic study of modern chickens suggested that <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41422-020-0349-y">domestication occurred among Southeast Asian red jungle fowl</a>. But DNA analyses, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/dna-evidence-rewriting-domestication-origin-stories">increasingly used to study animal domestication</a>, couldn’t specify when domesticated chickens first appeared (<em>SN: 7/6/17</em>).</p>



<p>Using chicken remains previously excavated at more than 600 sites in 89 countries, Peters’ group determined whether the chicken bones had been found where they were originally buried by soil or, instead, had moved downward into older sediment over time and thus were younger than previously assumed.</p>



<p>After establishing the timing of chickens’ appearances at various sites, the researchers used historical references to chickens and data on subsistence strategies in each society to develop a scenario of the animals’ domestication and spread.</p>



<p>The new story begins in Southeast Asian rice fields. The earliest known chicken remains come from Ban Non Wat, a dry rice–farming site in central Thailand that roughly dates to between 1650 B.C. and 1250 B.C. Dry rice farmers plant the crop on upland soil soaked by seasonal rains rather than in flooded fields or paddies. That would have made rice grains at Ban Non Wat fair game for avian ancestors of chickens.</p>



<p>These fields attracted hungry wild birds called red jungle fowl. Red jungle fowl increasingly fed on rice grains, and probably grains of another cereal crop called millet, grown by regional farmers, Peters’ group speculates. A cultivated familiarity with people launched chicken domestication by around 3,500 years ago, the researchers say.</p>



<p>Chickens did not arrive in central China, South Asia or Mesopotamian society in what’s now Iran and Iraq until nearly 3,000 years ago, the team estimates.</p>



<p>Peters and colleagues have for the first time assembled available evidence “into a fully coherent and plausible explanation of not only where and when, but also how and why chicken domestication happened,” says archaeologist Keith Dobney of the University of Sydney who did not participate in the new research.</p>



<p>But the new insights into chickens don’t end there. Using radiocarbon dating, Best’s group determined that 23 chicken bones from 16 sites in Eurasia and Africa were generally younger, in some cases by several thousand years, than previously thought. These bones had apparently settled into lower sediment layers over time, where they were found with items made by earlier human cultures.</p>

<p>Archaeological evidence indicates that chickens and rice cultivation spread across Asia and Africa in tandem, Peters’ group says. But rather than eating early chickens, people may have viewed them as special or sacred creatures. At Ban Non Wat and other early Southeast Asian sites, partial or whole skeletons of adult chickens were placed in human graves. That behavior suggests chickens enjoyed some sort of social or cultural significance, Peters says.</p>



<p>In Europe, several of the earliest chickens were buried alone or in human graves and show no signs of having been butchered.</p>



<p>The expansion of the Roman Empire around 2,000 years ago prompted more widespread consumption of chicken and eggs, Best and colleagues say. In England, chickens were not eaten regularly until around 1,700 years ago, primarily at Roman-influenced urban and military sites. Overall, about 700 to 800 years elapsed between the introduction of chickens in England and their acceptance as food, the researchers conclude. Similar lag times may have occurred at other sites where the birds were introduced.</p>

                <p><em>By</em> <a href="https://twitter.com/mattbwarren">Matthew Warren</a></p>



<p>In just the first few years of life, children develop a strong sense of fairness. At 16 months old, toddlers <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2021/06/15/at-just-16-months-old-toddlers-will-reward-someone-for-acting-fairly/">will reward someone who has fairly distributed food or toys</a> between two other people, for example. By two, <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2015/10/01/toddlers-have-an-instinct-for-fairness-and-generosity/">they tend to share toys equally themselves</a>.</p>



<p>A new study shows that children’s judgements of fairness also take into account the <em>method</em> by which resources have been allocated. Kids as young as four think that a teacher who has counted out cookies for a reward is fairer than one who gives that exact same reward without counting.  The research, <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0010027722001160">published in <em>Cognition</em></a>, suggests that when judging fairness, young children are able to consider the motivations of the person distributing resources.</p>



<span id="more-46355"></span>



<p>Colin Jacobs and colleagues from Yale University conducted a series of studies, all following the same basic methodology. First, children aged four to six were told a story about two puppets who had been asked by their teachers to help clean the classroom. They learned that one of the puppets had worked hard and cleaned a lot, while the other had not worked very hard. The children were then shown videos of two teachers distributing cookies to the puppets as a reward.</p>



<p>In the key study, one teacher split the cookies up into two piles by sight before giving them to the puppets, while the other teacher counted them out. In both cases, the hard-working puppet received seven cookies and the lazier puppet received three. But when asked which of the teachers was more fair, 73% of the kids chose the teacher who had counted the cookies out.</p>



<p>These results suggest that the kids weren’t only concerned with whether the ultimate distribution of cookies was fair — they also considered the process that the teacher used to divvy them up. This implies that they had some understanding of the teachers’ intent: the counting teacher presumably wanted to divide up the resources precisely, to appropriately reward the hard-working puppet, while the other teacher was less concerned about being precise — and so less concerned about being fair.</p>



<p>In the next study, the team explored an alternative explanation: that the kids believed the fairer teacher is the one who puts more effort into the task — in this case, the one who counts all the cookies. This time, one of the teachers had to spend a lot of effort moving a stack of notebooks out of the way, one-by-one, before dividing up the cookies by sight. The other counted out the cookies as before. Again, most of the kids — 70% — said that the counting teacher was fairer, suggesting that they weren’t simply considering how much effort the teachers put in.</p>



<p>In a final study, both teachers acted unfairly, giving just three cookies to the hard worker and seven to the one who had done minimal cleaning, and the kids were asked which teacher was very unfair. Now 69% of the children said the counting teacher was the <em>unfair</em> one. This again suggests that the kids were thinking about the motivations of the two teachers, with the counting teacher appearing to more purposefully ensure that the hard working puppet did not get a fair reward.</p>



<p>There are some limitations to the work. In particular, the kids were always forced to choose which of the two teachers was fairer (or which was unfair). The question implies from the outset that one teacher is known to be fairer than the other, so the children might be making an informed guess about which teacher the researchers are most likely to consider fair. An alternative would be to get kids to rate <em>how fair</em> each teacher is — though this is perhaps a hard task for such young children. Overall, though, the results suggest that children as young as four have quite a sophisticated understanding of how people use counting to distribute resources fairly.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/los-alamos-laboratory-atomic-bomb-wildfire">Growing wildfire threats loom over the birthplace of the atomic bomb</a></h4>

              
                <p>There are things I will always remember from my time in New Mexico. The way the bark of towering ponderosa pines smells of vanilla when you lean in close. Sweeping vistas, from forested mountaintops to the Rio Grande Valley, that embellish even the most mundane shopping trip. The trepidation that comes with the tendrils of smoke rising over nearby canyons and ridges during the dry, wildfire-prone summer months.</p>



<p>There were no major wildfires near Los Alamos National Laboratory during the year and a half that I worked in public communications there and lived just across Los Alamos Canyon from the lab. I’m in Maryland now, and social media this year has brought me images and video clips of the wildfires that have been devastating parts of New Mexico, including the Cerro Pelado fire in the Jemez Mountains just west of the lab.</p>





<p>Wherever they pop up, wildfires can ravage the land, destroy property and displace residents by the tens of thousands. The Cerro Pelado fire is small compared with others raging east of Santa Fe — it grew only to the size of Washington, D.C. The fire, which started mysteriously on April 22, is now mostly contained. But at one point it came within 5.6 kilometers of the lab, seriously threatening the place that’s responsible for creating and maintaining key portions of fusion bombs in our nation’s nuclear arsenal.</p>



<p>That close call may be just a hint of growing fire risks to come for the weapons lab as the Southwest suffers in the <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/climate-change-made-southwestern-u-s-drought-worst-1200-years">grip of an epic drought</a> made worse by human-caused climate change (<em>SN: 4/16/20</em>). May and June typically mark the start of the state’s wildfire season. This year, fires erupted in April and were amplified by a string of warm, dry and windy days. The Hermits Peak and Calf Canyon fires east of Santa Fe have merged to become <a href="https://www.npr.org/2022/05/16/1098779996/new-mexico-wildfires-southwest-not-unprecedented">the largest wildfire in New Mexico’s recorded history</a>.</p>



<p>Los Alamos National Lab is in northern New Mexico, about 56 kilometers northwest of Santa Fe. The lab’s primary efforts revolve around nuclear weapons, accounting for 71 percent of its $3.9 billion budget, according the lab’s fiscal year 2021 numbers. The budget covers a ramp-up in production of hollow plutonium spheres, known as “pits” because they are the cores of nuclear bombs, <a href="https://www.energy.gov/nnsa/plutonium-pit-production">to 30 per year beginning in 2026</a>. That’s triple the lab’s current capability <a href="https://appropriations.house.gov/sites/democrats.appropriations.house.gov/files/HR%201865%20-%20Division%20C%20-%20EW%20SOM%20FY20.pdf">of 10 pits per year</a>. The site is also home to radioactive waste and debris that has been a consequence of weapons production <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/atomic-bomb-physics-fission-hiroshima-anniversary">since the first atomic bomb was built in Los Alamos</a> in the early 1940s (<em>SN: 8/6/20</em>).</p>



<p>What is the danger due to fire approaching the lab’s nuclear material and waste? According to literature that Peter Hyde, a spokesperson for the lab, sent to me to ease my concern, not much.</p>



<p>Over the last 3½ years, the lab has removed 3,500 tons of trees and other potential wildfire fuel from the sprawling, 93-square-kilometer complex. Lab facilities, a lab pamphlet says, “are designed and operated to protect the materials that are inside, and radiological and other potentially hazardous materials are stored in containers that are engineered and tested to withstand extreme environments, including heat from fire.”</p>



<p>What’s more, most of roughly 20,000 drums full of nuclear waste that were stored under tents on the lab’s grounds have been removed. They were a cause for anxiety <a href="https://www.npr.org/2011/06/28/137468916/mandatory-evacuations-ordered-as-wildfire-threatens-los-alamos">during the last major fire to threaten the lab in 2011</a>. According to the most recent numbers on the project’s website, <a href="https://n3b-la.com/area-g-tru/#numbers">all but 3,812 of those drums have been shipped off</a> to be stored 655 meters underground at the Waste Isolation Pilot Plant near Carlsbad, N.M.</p>



<p>But there’s still <a href="https://www.energy.gov/em/articles/los-alamos-national-laboratory-strategic-vision-2022-2032">3,500 cubic meters of nuclear waste</a> &nbsp;in the storage area, according to a March 2022 DOE strategic planning document for Los Alamos. That’s enough to fill 17,000 55-gallon drums. So potentially disastrous quantities of relatively exposed nuclear waste remain at the lab — a single drum from the lab site that <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/30/us/in-us-cleanup-efforts-accident-at-nuclear-site-points-to-cost-of-lapses.html">exploded after transport to Carlsbad in 2014</a> resulted in a two-year shutdown of the storage facility. With a total budgeted cleanup cost of $2 billion, the incident is one of the most expensive nuclear accidents in the nation’s history.</p>



<p>Since the 2011 fire, a wider buffer space around the tents has been cleared of vegetation. In conjunction with fire suppression systems, it’s unlikely that wildfire will be a danger to the waste-filled drums, according to a <a href="https://permalink.lanl.gov/object/tr?what=info:lanl-repo/lareport/LA-UR-16-26211">2016 risk analysis of extreme wildfire scenarios</a> conducted by the lab.</p>



<p>But <a href="https://www.energy.gov/ig/downloads/audit-report-doe-oig-21-13">a February 2021 audit</a> by the U.S. Department of Energy’s Office of Inspector General is less rosy. It found that, despite the removal of most of the waste drums and the multiyear wildfire mitigation efforts that the lab describes, the lab’s wildfire protection is still lacking.</p>



<p>According to the 20-page federal audit, the lab at that time had not developed a “comprehensive, risk-based approach to wildland fire management” in accordance with federal policies related to wildland fire management. The report also noted compounding issues, including the absence of federal oversight of the lab’s wildfire management activities.</p>

<p>Among the ongoing risks, not all fire roads were maintained well enough to provide a safe route for firefighters and others, “which could create dangerous conditions for emergency responders and delay response times,” the auditors wrote.</p>



<p>And a canyon that runs between the lab and the adjacent town of Los Alamos was identified in the report as being packed with 10 times the number of trees that would be ideal, from a wildfire safety perspective. To make matters worse, there’s a hazardous waste site at the bottom of the canyon that could, the auditors wrote, “produce a health risk to the environment and to human health during a fire.”</p>



<p>“The report was pretty stark,” says Edwin Lyman, director of nuclear power safety at the Union of Concerned Scientists. “And certainly, after all the warnings, if they’re still not doing all they need to do to fully mitigate the risk, then that’s just foolishness.”</p>



<p><a>A </a><a href="https://www.energy.gov/sites/default/files/igprod/documents/IG-0760.pdf">2007 federal audit</a> of Los Alamos, as well as nuclear weapons facilities in Washington state and Idaho, showed similar problems. In short, it seems little has changed at Los Alamos in the 14-year span between 2007 and 2021. Lab spokespeople did not respond to my questions about the lab’s efforts to address the specific problems identified in the 2021 report, despite repeated requests.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The Los Alamos area has experienced three major wildfires since the lab was founded — the Cerro Grande fire in 2000, Las Conchas in 2011 and Cerro Pelado this year. But we probably can’t count on 11-year gaps between future wildfires near Los Alamos, according to Alice Hill, the senior fellow for energy and the environment with the Council on Foreign Relations, who’s based in Washington, D.C.</p>



<p>The changing climate is expected to dramatically affect wildfire risks in years to come, turning&nbsp;Los Alamos and surrounding areas into a tinderbox. A study in 2018 in <em>Climatic Change </em>found that the region extending from the higher elevations in New Mexico, where Los Alamos is located, into Colorado and Arizona will experience the <a href="http://web.missouri.edu/~stambaughm/Stambaugh_etal_2018_ClimaticChange.pdf">greatest increase in wildfire probabilities in the Southwest</a>. A new risk projection tool that was recommended by Hill, called Risk Factor, also <a href="https://riskfactor.com/zip/87544/87544_fsid/fire">shows increasing fire risk in the Los Alamos area</a> over the next 30 years.</p>



<p>“We are at the point where we are imagining, as we have to, things that we’ve never experienced,” Hill says. “That is fundamentally different than how we have approached these problems throughout human history, which is to look to the past to figure out how to be safer in the future…. The nature of wildfire has changed as more heat is added [to the planet], as temperatures rise.”</p>



<p>Increased plutonium pit production will add to the waste that needs to be shipped to Carlsbad. “Certainly, the radiological assessments in sort of the worst case of wildfire could lead to a pretty significant release of radioactivity, not only affecting the workers onsite but also the offsite public. It’s troubling,” says Lyman, who suggests that nuclear labs like Los Alamos should not be located in such fire-prone areas.</p>

<p>For now, some risks from the Cerra Pelado wildfire will persist, according to Jeff Surber, operations section chief for the U.S. Department of Agriculture Forestry Service’s efforts to fight the fire. Large wildfires like Cerra Pelado “hold heat for so long and they continue to smolder in the interior where it burns intermittently,” he said in a May 9 briefing to Los Alamos County residents, and to concerned people like me watching online.</p>



<p>It will be vital to monitor the footprint of the fire until rain or snow finally snuffs it out late in the year. Even then, some danger will linger in the form of <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/zombie-forest-fires-climate-change">“zombie fires</a>” that can flame up long after wildfires appear to have been extinguished (<em>SN: 5/19/21)</em>. “We’ve had fires come back in the springtime because there was a root underground that somehow stayed lit all winter long,” said Surber.</p>



<p>So the Cerro Pelado fire, and its occasional smoky tendrils, will probably be a part of life in northern New Mexico for months still. And the future seems just as fiery, if not worse. That’s something all residents, including the lab, need to be preparing for.</p>



<p>Meantime, if you make it out to the mountains of New Mexico soon enough, be sure to sniff a vanilla-flavored ponderosa while you still can. I know I will.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/pulsar-radio-waves-neutron-star-astronomy">A newfound, oddly slow pulsar shouldn’t emit radio waves — yet it does</a></h4>

              
                <p>Astronomers have added a new species to the neutron star zoo, showcasing the wide diversity among the compact magnetic remains of dead, once-massive stars.</p>



<p>The newfound highly magnetic pulsar has a <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41550-022-01688-x">surprisingly long rotation period</a>, which is challenging the theoretical understanding of these objects, researchers report May 30 in <em>Nature Astronomy</em>. Dubbed PSR J0901-4046, this pulsar sweeps its lighthouse-like radio beam past Earth about every 76 seconds — <a href="https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/aade88">three times slower than the previous record holder</a>.</p>





<p>While it’s an oddball, some of this newfound pulsar’s characteristics are common among its relatives. That means this object may help astronomers better connect the evolutionary phases among mysterious species in the neutron star menagerie.</p>



<p>Astronomers know of many types of neutron stars. Each one is the compact object left over after a massive star’s explosive death, but their characteristics can vary. A pulsar is a neutron star that astronomers detect at a regular interval thanks to its cosmic alignment: The star’s strong magnetic field produces beams of radio waves emanating from near the star’s poles, and every time one of those beams sweeps across Earth, astronomers can see a radio pulse.</p>



<p>The newfound, slowpoke pulsar sits in our galaxy, roughly 1,300 light-years away. Astrophysicist Manisha Caleb of the University of Sydney in Australia and her colleagues found it in data from the MeerKAT radio telescope outside Carnarvon, South Africa.</p>



<p>Further observations with MeerKAT revealed not only the pulsar’s slow, steady radio beat — a measure of how fast it spins — but also another important detail: The rate at which the spin slows as the pulsar ages. And those two bits of info revealed something odd about this pulsar. According to theory, it should not be emitting radio waves. And yet, it is.</p>



<p>As neutron stars age, they lose energy and spin more slowly. According to calculations, “at some point, they&#8217;ve exhausted all their energy, and they cease to emit any sort of emission,” Caleb says. They’ve become dead to detectors.</p>



<p>A pulsar’s rotation period and the slowdown of its spin relates to the strength of its magnetic field, which accelerates subatomic particles streaming from the star and, in turn, generates radio waves. Any neutron stars spinning as slowly as PSR J0901-4046 are in this stellar “graveyard” and shouldn’t produce radio signals.</p>



<p>But “we just keep finding weirder and weirder pulsars that chip away at that understanding,” says astrophysicist Maura McLaughlin of West Virginia University in Morgantown, who wasn’t involved with this work.</p>



<p>The newfound pulsar could be its own unique species of neutron star. But in some ways, it also looks a bit familiar, Caleb says. She and her colleagues calculated the pulsar’s magnetic field from the rate its spin is slowing, and it’s incredibly strong, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/magnetars-missing-link">similar to magnetars</a> (<em>SN: 9/17/02</em>). This hints that PSR J0901-4046 could be what’s known as a “quiescent magnetar,” which is a pulsar with very strong magnetic fields that occasionally emits brilliantly energetic bursts of X-rays or other radiation. “We&#8217;re going to need either X-ray emission or [ultraviolet] observations to confirm whether it is indeed a magnetar or a pulsar,” she says.</p>



<p>The discovery team still has additional observations to analyze. “We do have a truckload more data on it,” says astrophysicist Ian Heywood of the University of Oxford. The researchers are looking at how the object’s brightness is changing over time and whether its spin abruptly changes, or “glitches.”</p>



<p>The astronomers also are altering their automated computer programs, which scan the radio data and flag intriguing signals, to look for these longer-duration spin periods — or even weirder and more mysterious neutron star phenomena. “The sweet thing about astronomy, for me, is what&#8217;s out there waiting for us to find,” Heywood says.</p>

<p><strong>A busy week for science in Moscow </strong>—&nbsp;<a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/busy-week-science-moscow"><em>Science News</em></a><em>,</em>&nbsp;June 3, 1972</p>



<p>U.S. and Soviet leaders … signed agreements on space, science and technology, health and the environment…. The space agreement … outlines plans for cooperation in fields such as meteorology, study of the natural environment, planetary exploration and space biology.</p>



<h4>Update</h4>



<p>The 1972 space agreement led to the <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/summit-space-first-step-taken">first inter­national human spaceflight</a>, the Apollo-Soyuz mission, during which Soviet and U.S.&nbsp;crews socialized in space (<em>SN: 7/26/75, p. 52</em>). Apollo-Soyuz encouraged decades of collaboration that continues today on the International Space Station. Now, Russia’s war in Ukraine has prompted many countries <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/russia-ukraine-war-space-science-nasa">to pull back on scientific endeavors with Russia</a>, in space and on Earth (<em>SN: 3/26/22, p.&nbsp;6</em>). While NASA remains committed to the space station, the head of Russia’s space agency has threatened to end the cooperation in retaliation for sanctions imposed in response to the war. Russia has yet to make moves to abandon the station, though the country has ceased supplying rocket engines to the United States.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/pfas-forever-chemicals-uv-iodide-perfluoroalkyl-polyfluoroalkyl-sulfite">Just 3 ingredients can quickly destroy widely used PFAS ‘forever chemicals’</a></h4>

              
                <p>The undoing of toxic “forever chemicals” may be found in products in your pantry.</p>



<p>Perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances, also known as PFAS, can persist in the environment for centuries. While the health impacts of only a fraction of the thousands of different types of PFAS have been studied, research has linked exposure to high levels of some of these widespread, humanmade chemicals to health issues such as cancer and reproductive problems.</p>



<p>Now, a study shows that the combination of <a href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.est.1c07608">ultraviolet light and a couple of common chemicals</a> can break down nearly all the PFAS in a concentrated solution in just hours. The process involves blasting UV radiation at a solution containing PFAS and iodide, which is often added to table salt, and sulfite, a common food preservative, researchers report in the March 15 <em>Environmental Science &amp; Technology</em>.</p>





<p>“They show that when [iodide and sulfite] are combined, the system becomes a lot more efficient,” says Garrett McKay, an environmental chemist at Texas A&amp;M University in College Station who was not involved in the study. “It’s a big step forward.”</p>



<p>A PFAS molecule contains a chain of carbon atoms that are bonded to fluorine atoms. The carbon-fluorine bond is one the strongest known chemical bonds. This sticky bond makes PFAS useful for many applications, such as <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/pfas-chemicals-biodegradable-food-containers-compost">water- and oil-repellant coatings</a>, firefighting foams and <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/cosmetics-makeup-pfas-chemicals">cosmetics</a> (<em>SN: 6/4/19; SN: 6/15/21</em>). Owing to their widespread use and longevity, PFAS have been detected in soils, food and even drinking water. <a href="https://www.epa.gov/pfas/our-current-understanding-human-health-and-environmental-risks-pfas">The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency</a> sets healthy advisory levels for PFOA and PFOS — two common types of PFAS — at 70 parts per trillion.</p>



<p>Treatment facilities can filter PFAS out of water using technologies such as activated carbon filters or ion exchange resins. But these removal processes concentrate PFAS into a waste that requires a lot of energy and resources to destroy, says study coauthor Jinyong Liu, an environmental chemist at the University of California, Riverside. “If we don&#8217;t [destroy this waste], there will be secondary contamination concerns.”</p>



<p>One of the most well-studied ways to degrade PFAS involves mixing them into a solution with sulfite and then blasting the mixture with UV rays. The radiation rips electrons from the sulfite, which then move around, snipping the stubborn carbon-fluorine bonds and thereby breaking down the molecules.</p>



<p>But some PFAS, such as a type known as PFBS, have proven difficult to degrade this way. Liu and his colleagues irradiated a solution containing PFBS and sulfite for an entire day, only to find that less than half of the pollutant in the solution had broken down. Achieving higher levels of degradation required more time and additional sulfite to be poured in at spaced intervals.</p>



<p>The researchers knew that iodide exposed to UV radiation produces more bond-cutting electrons than sulfite. And previous research has demonstrated that UV irradiation paired with iodide alone <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0043135410001363">could be used to degrade PFAS chemicals</a>.</p>



<p>So Liu and his colleagues blasted UV rays at a solution containing PFBS, iodide and sulfite. To the researchers’ surprise, after 24 hours of irradiation, less than 1 percent of the stubborn PFBS remained.</p>



<p>What’s more, the researchers showed that the process destroyed other types of PFAS with similar efficiency and was also effective when PFAS concentrations were 10 times that which UV light and sulfite alone could degrade. And by adding iodide the researchers found that they could speed up the reaction, Liu says, making the process that much more energy efficient.</p>



<p>In the solution, iodide and sulfite worked together to sustain the destruction of PFAS molecules, Liu explains. When UV rays release an electron from iodide, that iodide is converted into a reactive molecule which may then recapture freed electrons. But here sulfite can step in and bond with these reactive molecules and with electron-scavenging oxygen in the solution. This sulfite “trap” helps keep the released electrons free to cut apart PFAS molecules for eight times longer than if sulfite wasn’t there, the researchers report.</p>



<p>It’s surprising that no one had demonstrated the effectiveness of using sulfite with iodide to degrade PFAS before, McKay says.</p>



<p>Liu and his colleagues are now collaborating with an engineering company, using their new process to treat PFAS in a concentrated waste stream. The pilot test will conclude in about two years.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/gene-drives-mosquito-malaria-crispr-africa-public-outreach">Who decides whether to use gene drives against malaria-carrying mosquitoes?</a></h4>

              
                <p class="has-drop-cap" style="font-size:20px">In a large laboratory cage, a male mosquito carries a genetic weapon that could launch the destruction of his species. That loss could also mean the end of the parasite that causes malaria.</p>



<p>The weapon, a self-replicating bit of DNA known as a gene drive, is one of the most anticipated and controversial tools being developed to stop mosquitoes from spreading diseases like malaria to humans.</p>



<p>The gene drive interferes with the insects’ ability to reproduce. It wiped out captive populations of mosquitoes in <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/lab-tests-gene-drive-wiped-out-population-mosquitoes">eight to 12 generations</a> (<em>SN: 10/27/18, p. 6</em>) in a small lab study. In 2021, the technology worked in the large cages in Terni, Italy, too. Within as little as five to 10 years, this gene drive could be ready to test in the wild.</p>





<p>The first experimental release could be rolled out in Burkina Faso, Mali, Ghana or Uganda. In those locations, researchers are working with a nonprofit research consortium called Target Malaria to develop the gene drive carriers along with other genetically engineered mosquitoes to fight malaria.</p>



<p>This research is driven by the idea that every tool available must be used to fight malaria, which <a href="https://www.who.int/news/item/06-12-2021-more-malaria-cases-and-deaths-in-2020-linked-to-covid-19-disruptions">sickened close to 241 million people in 2020</a> and killed 670,000 worldwide, mostly in Africa. Children 5 years old and younger accounted for about 80 percent of the continent’s malaria deaths, the World Health Organization says.</p>



<p>Because of malaria’s huge toll, large investments have been made to fight the disease, yielding preventive drugs, insecticide-treated bed nets and even malaria vaccines — one <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/2021-science-stories-updates-mosquitoes-malaria-tulsa-wildfires">was recently recommended for use in sub-Saharan Africa</a> (<em>SN: 12/18/21 &amp; 1/1/22, p. 32</em>). These efforts are helping. But mosquitoes are developing resistance to insecticides, and some anti-malaria drugs may no longer work well.</p>



<p>“To go toward zero [cases], we need to have something that is transformational,” says Fredros Okumu, a mosquito biologist and director of science at Ifakara Health Institute in Tanzania.</p>





<p>Gene drives might be the transformational answer people are looking for. Researchers are still refining and testing the technology, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/gene-drives-spread-their-wings">which was first devised in 2015</a> (<em>SN: 12/12/15, p. 16</em>). Though <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/genetically-modified-mosquito-test-california-epa-oxitec">other types of genetically altered mosquitoes</a> have been released in Brazil, the United States and elsewhere, those altered genes spread slowly among wild populations (<em>SN Online: 3/9/22</em>). Gene drives could potentially spread to nearly ever member of a species quickly, forever altering the species or wiping it out.</p>



<p>But whether gene drives ever play a role in combating malaria may depend as much on social considerations as on science.</p>



<p>“A technology doesn’t work by technical strength alone. It works because it embeds into a social context,” says Ramya Rajagopalan, a social scientist at the University of California, San Diego. In the past, scientists “developed a technology in the lab, got it all set up and ready to go, and then you go to the stakeholders and say, ‘Hey, we have this great technology, do you want to use it?’ ”</p>



<p>If people reject that sort of offer, as has happened with some genetically modified crops, researchers often think, “If [the public] only knew enough about the technology, they’d be more accepting,” Rajagopalan says. But more often the failure comes because the researchers “don’t include community voices from the outset in the design and the implementation.”</p>



<p>Because of the possibility of forever altering ecosystems, the European Union has already said “no” to using gene drives there. But Africa is where a gene drive might one day help defeat malaria. Researchers are hoping to eventually release gene drives on the continent, but must first get public consensus. To that end, scientists are looking for ways to involve members of the public in research, and learn about local priorities and how to talk about the technology.</p>

<h4>Rattling the cage</h4>



<p>No one is ready to let mosquitoes carrying gene drives out of the lab yet. For now, researchers are doing tests with mosquitoes in captivity to get an idea of whether the technology will work as planned. In the Terni cage trials, scientists used small rooms, setting humidity levels, lighting and other characteristics to mimic some of the conditions the mosquitoes might encounter in the wild.</p>



<p>In cages almost 5 cubic meters big — about the size of a small dressing room — containing hundreds of <em>Anopheles gambiae </em>mosquitoes, scientists added male members of the same species that carried the engineered change to their DNA.</p>



<p>The gene drive used for this experiment is built on the molecular scissors known as CRISPR/Cas9. Male mosquitoes are engineered to carry the gene drive, which consists of instructions for making the DNA-cutting enzyme Cas9 and an RNA that guides the enzyme to the gene to be cut. When an engineered male mates with an unaltered female, Cas9 snips a gene called <em>doublesex </em>inside the fertilized egg. As the egg tries to repair the cut, the gene drive from the father’s <em>doublesex</em> gene is pasted over the copy of the gene inherited from the mother. So the offspring gets two copies of the gene drive, instead of one.</p>



<p>Normally, any particular version of a gene has a 50 percent chance of being passed from parent to offspring. But with the copy-and-paste CRISPR system, gene drive–carrying mosquitoes pass the drive to about 96 percent of male progeny and more than 99 percent of females. With that genetic cheat, the gene drive spreads rapidly through the population.</p>



<div class="wp-block-sciencenews-content-sidebar alignwide">
<h3>Upping the odds&nbsp;</h3>



<p>With other forms of genetic engineering, the altered gene follows normal rules of inheritance and is passed on to only 50 percent of offspring. Gene drives can paste themselves into a gene inherited from an unaltered parent, ensuring the genetic change gets passed on more often.</p>

<p>The<em> doublesex</em> gene is essential for the development of female mosquitoes. When the gene doesn’t work, “the mosquito itself doesn’t work,” says Ruth Müller, chief ecologist and entomologist at the Institute of Tropical Medicine in Antwerp, Belgium. The gene drive breaks the gene.</p>



<p>Female offspring that inherit two copies of a broken <em>doublesex</em> gene develop mouthparts and genitalia that are closer to the male form. Those females are sterile, and they cannot bite people with their malformed mouthparts. Unable to bite, those mosquitoes can’t transmit malaria-causing parasites from their bodies to humans.</p>



<p>In those naturelike cages in Terni, when gene drive–carrying mosquitoes were introduced, the populations <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-021-24790-6">died out in 245 to 311 days</a>, researchers reported in July 2021 in <em>Nature Communications</em>. In two cages where no gene drive mosquitoes were added, mosquito populations lived normally to the end of the experiment.</p>



<p>This was the first proof that the gene drive might work under almost real-world conditions, says Müller, one of the study’s leaders. But there is still a lot to learn about drives, she says, including how they will affect mosquito populations in the wild, whether they can slow malaria’s spread and importantly, what the impact will be on other creatures in the environment.</p>



<p>Getting those answers will determine the feasibility of moving forward scientifically. They will also play a big role in whether the public agrees to releasing a tool that could intentionally drive a species toward extinction.</p>

<h3>Population crash&nbsp;</h3>



<p>In large cages with about 570 mosquitoes, researchers added about 70 gene drive–carrying males. As the gene drive spread, more females became sterile and egg production crashed (red and blue lines). The gene drives worked faster than computer simulations suggested (gray lines). In control cages with no gene drive, egg production continued as usual (horizontal dotted black line).</p>

<p>While Müller’s and other Target Malaria science teams based in Africa, Europe and North America refine gene drives, other affiliated and independent groups are mapping out what releasing a gene drive could do to the planet. “Right now there are a lot of theoretical discussions,” Müller says. It’s important to gather data to “fill the debate with more facts” about the real risks and benefits, she says.</p>



<p>At least <a href="https://malariajournal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12936-021-03674-6">46 theoretical harms could arise from the use of gene drives on mosquitoes</a>, researchers reported in March 2021 in <em>Malaria Journal</em>. Those potential downsides include reductions in pollinators and other species directly or indirectly related to the disappearance of the mosquitoes. It’s possible that people could develop allergic reactions to the bite of mosquitoes carrying a single copy of the gene drive, or to fish that eat the altered mosquito larvae. There could be a decline in water quality caused by large numbers of mosquito larvae dying. There’s even a set of scenarios in which malaria cases increase if, for instance, mosquito species that are better malaria spreaders take over in areas where a gene drive has thinned out less-troublesome mosquitoes.</p>



<p>Dreaming up possible nightmare consequences was an exercise intended to tell researchers what they might need to plan for and test before releasing gene drive mosquitoes into the wild. At workshops held in 2016 through 2019 in Ghana, Kenya, Botswana, Gabon and the United States, researchers worked out a chain of events that might lead to each of those potential harms.</p>



<p>The list of 46 possibilities focused on four areas that African leaders said were most important to protect: biodiversity, human and animal health, and water quality. By identifying these hypothetical hazards, researchers can begin calculating the likelihood of a harm happening and how bad it could be, says report coauthor John Connolly, a senior regulatory scientist for Target Malaria who is based at Imperial College London.</p>



<p>“You probably never really finish a risk assessment, but you get a clearer understanding of the risks and uncertainties,” Connolly says. Target Malaria and independent groups hope to answer some questions by examining data collected from the release of genetically altered mosquitoes that don’t carry gene drives.</p>



<p>Studies of biological pest control mechanisms — such as releasing a predator to eradicate an invasive species (remember invasive cane toads in Australia [<em>SN Online: 10/14/14</em>]) — may also provide some clues about how gene drives may spread, says Keith Hayes, who leads a risk assessment team at the Commonwealth Science and Industrial Research Organization’s Data61 in Hobart, Australia.</p>



<p>Some questions may never truly be answered unless gene drives are released. Scientists can experiment and simulate what might happen, but “at some point you have to say, ‘We don’t know everything. We can’t know everything. There may be surprises,’ ” Hayes says. That’s when a decision will need to be made about a release based on what is known about the risks and benefits.</p>



<h4>High stakes</h4>



<p>Even if those evaluations reveal downsides to gene drives, the potential benefits for human health and economics may far outweigh the risks, Müller argues.</p>



<p>“If you have a high burden of malaria, that costs a lot,” Müller says. “Children cannot go to school. People cannot go to work. That should also be considered if you talk about costs.”</p>



<p>Opponents of gene drives say it’s unfair to paint rejection of the unproven, potentially dangerous, technology as dooming children to death from malaria. “We are already not saving those children with measures [that would help] such as improving sanitation and the medical system,” says Mareike Imken, the European coordinator of the Stop Gene Drives campaign. Her organization is <a href="https://www.stop-genedrives.eu/en/">calling for a global moratorium</a> on the release of gene drives until there is worldwide consensus on whether they are safe and necessary and how they should be regulated.</p>



<p>“We need the highest possible obstacle to using this high-risk … technology,” Imken says. Allowing gene drives to be tried against malaria would essentially unleash them for use against a wide variety of organisms, with potentially devastating ecological consequences, she says. Instead, the world should invest more in already proven methods of controlling and eradicating malaria.</p>



<p>But there are potential upsides to gene drives that current approaches, such as insecticides, don’t offer. “The stuff we have been doing for years has been intentionally designed to eradicate mosquitoes. It just didn’t do it. We’ve been spraying the hell out of them for years, and in the process killing a lot of other nontarget organisms,” Okumu says.</p>



<p>By replacing insecticides, gene drives might help save insects including bees, butterflies and other pollinators. And gene drives are designed to eliminate only the mosquito species that are dangerous, Okumu says. “Of all the 3,500 species … we need to target one, two, at maximum three of them.”</p>



<p>He’s referring to the handful of species in the <em>Anopheles </em>genus that are mostly responsible for spreading malaria. In Africa, the primary disease carriers are <em>Anopheles gambiae</em> and the look-alikes <em>An. arabiensis</em>, <em>An. coluzzii</em> and <em>An. funestus.</em></p>



<p>While eradicating malaria is the goal, making mosquitoes extinct is mostly hyperbole, says Tony Nolan, a molecular biologist at the Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine in England.</p>



<p>“Extinction is not a likely outcome, nor even a desirable one. It’s not necessary to make the mosquito extinct to eliminate malaria,” says Nolan, one of the Target Malaria researchers developing gene drives. Geographic isolation may enable the gene drive to eliminate a local population of mosquitoes but nothing further afield. Mutations can arise in the Cas9 or guide RNA, causing the drive to stop working. Or other things might limit its spread.</p>



<p>But what would happen to the environment if a major mosquito species suddenly disappeared? Some researchers are trying to measure the ecological contributions of <em>An. gambiae</em>, including whether males pollinate plants visited for nectar. As of now, the mosquitoes’ biggest known value is as food for predators. Birds, fish and other animals that eat mosquitoes or their larvae usually aren’t picky about which species is for dinner. Only one species of spider is known to prefer <em>Anopheles</em> mosquitoes over other kinds.</p>



<p>Okumu’s experience leads him to think the malaria carriers wouldn’t be missed much. In some parts of eastern Africa, including Okumu’s home village in Tanzania, a combination of factors including prolonged dry seasons and insecticide and bed net use pushed <em>An. gambiae</em> out. “We have not seen — maybe because we didn’t measure [well enough] — any ecological challenges associated with the disappearance of <em>Anopheles gambiae</em>,” he says.</p>



<p>The mix of malaria carriers can vary considerably depending on local conditions. In Burkina Faso in western Africa, for instance, two villages had different mosquito populations: In Bana, to the northwest of the city Bobo­-Dioulasso, about 90 percent of mosquitoes were <em>An. coluzzii</em> with <em>An. gambiae</em> <a href="https://malariajournal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12936-019-2747-5">making up 9 percent of the catch</a>, researchers reported in 2019 in <em>Malaria Journal</em>. But on the southeastern side of the city, in the village of Pala, <em>An. gambiae</em> dominated, making up about 84 percent of mosquitoes caught. <em>An. arabiensis</em> accounted for about 10 percent, and <em>An. coluzzii</em> was about 6 percent of the catch in Pala.</p>



<p>If <em>An. gambiae</em> disappeared, one of the other species would fill the vacuum, Okumu says. That could be a good thing if the replacements don’t bite people as much or are lousy at spreading malaria. It could also be worse if the balance shifts toward a more voracious people-biter that easily spreads the parasites.</p>

<h4>Community input</h4>



<p>Beyond the scientific hurdles, researchers must also get the public on board with releasing the technology. Without public support, even a gene drive that works perfectly could be a no-go.</p>



<p>Not everyone agrees on when and how to get input. Okumu worries that asking the public whether they want gene drives before scientists have answers to some of the most pressing questions could backfire. “I would rather we know the true benefits, the true risks and gain a consensus around it, and then start engaging the communities,” he says.</p>



<p>Waiting until all the answers are in hand is a flawed approach, says Lea Pare Toe, a social scientist at the Institut de Recherche en Sciences de la Santé in Bobo-Dioulasso. “We should listen to [the community] and develop the science together,” says Toe, who works with Target Malaria to engage local people in the research.</p>



<p>At Bana, researchers didn’t start out talking about gene drives, or even genetic modifications, Toe says. First, the team had to clarify the connection between mosquitoes and malaria. They also had to dispel myths, such as eating fatty foods or sweet fruit can cause the disease. After an intensive engagement campaign from 2014 through 2019, researchers <a href="https://malariajournal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12936-021-03929-2#Tab2">found that such false statements were far less accepted</a>, the researchers reported in October 2021 in <em>Malaria Journal</em>.</p>



<div class="wp-block-sciencenews-content-sidebar alignwide">
<h3>Fact vs. fiction&nbsp;</h3>



<p>Over five years, discussions with residents of Bana, Burkina Faso, cleared up some misconceptions about how malaria is transmitted. The talks were part of a Target Malaria effort to involve the community in plans to use genetically modified mosquitoes. </p>

<p>Once people are clear on the causes of malaria, Toe and colleagues introduce the idea of genetics, and how researchers want to alter mosquitoes to combat malaria. People are generally OK with the uncertainty of research, she says. But they want to know more.</p>



<p>Residents pose specific questions about mosquito biology and ask how researchers can possibly work with such small creatures. They often ask whether the genetic alterations that make the mosquitoes sterile will transfer to humans. People “love the details,” Toe says.</p>



<p>Sometimes, creative approaches are needed to get concepts across. For instance, Target Malaria planned a first stage — releasing genetically sterilized male mosquitoes that won’t diminish mosquito populations — to help researchers collect data on how genetically altered mosquitoes stack up to normal ones in the wild.</p>



<p>Before those altered mosquitoes were set free, the organization wanted to ensure that Bana residents had a deep understanding of the project. Local leaders suggested a play. The scientists wrote a script, but the actors, a local storyteller and other community members <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41599-022-01122-7">revised it to improve storytelling</a>. This helped forge an emotional connection with the audience, Toe and colleagues reported April 5 in <em>Humanities and Social Sciences Communications</em>.</p>

<p>Meanwhile in Tanzania, although reluctant to move too soon with the public, Okumu and colleagues talked with community leaders and surveyed residents of 10 villages in the southeastern part of the country, where very few people had heard about genetically modifying mosquitoes. The aim of this 2019 effort was to understand community perceptions, rather than ask permission. People were intrigued by the idea of gene drives, but they had concerns about whether the mosquitoes <a href="https://malariajournal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12936-021-03663-9#Tab2">would look and behave differently from local mosquitoes</a>, the team reported in March 2021 in <em>Malaria Journal</em>.</p>



<p>Community members were also skeptical that targeting just one type of mosquito would be enough to reduce malaria transmission or decrease mosquito bites enough to keep communities on board with the project. It would be better, they said, to get rid of all the biting mosquitoes.</p>



<p>In a separate study done in 2019, people in Uganda who were already familiar with gene drives expressed similar concerns. But those participants anticipated problems if the mosquitoes <a href="https://malariajournal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12936-021-03682-6">cross national borders into a country opposed to the release</a>, researchers reported in March 2021 in <em>Malaria Journal</em>. Researchers may have to seek permission to release gene drive mosquitoes on a multinational scale, instead of just getting local and national consent.</p>



<p>Gene drives may win hearts and minds because they will first be tried against disease-carrying mosquitoes “that are very, very much not beloved or charismatic or anything,” says developmental geneticist Kimberly Cooper of UC San Diego. “Do you know anyone who has sympathies for the mosquito? It’s probably the most hated animal on the planet.</p>



<p>“But there will always be people who are very concerned about genetically modified organisms and their release into the environment,” even if those organisms are mosquitoes, says Cooper, who is not involved with the malaria gene drive research but is developing a <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/crispr-gene-drive-mice-pest-control-one-step-closer-reality">gene drive to use as a research tool in mice</a> (<em>SN Online: 1/23/19</em>).</p>



<p>Still, the attraction of stamping out malaria is powerful. The benefits could be enormous. But whether they outweigh any environmental risks from the technology and whether the public will buy in to this radical approach remains to be seen.</p>



<p>“There are tons of unknowns,” Okumu says. “The question is, should we pursue it? If you ask me, it would be unethical not to.”</p>



<div class="wp-block-sciencenews-content-sidebar alignwide">
<h4>Vampire spiders might miss <em>Anopheles </em>mosquitoes … for a minute</h4>



<p>If gene drives wiped out swaths of malaria-carrying mosquitoes, perhaps the only creature that would mourn the loss is a species of jumping spider found in the Lake Victoria region of Kenya and Uganda.</p>



<p>The spiders, <em>Evarcha culicivora</em>, share the mosquitoes’ taste for human and animal blood. “This vampire spider is perhaps the only species we know is heavily dependent on these [mosquitoes],” says Fredros Okumu, a mosquito biologist and director of science at Ifakara Health Institute in Tanzania. He’s referring to <em>Anopheles</em> mosquitoes, a main malaria spreader in Africa.</p>



<p>Blood is a unisex perfume for the spiders. Adults that have recently feasted on blood are more attractive to the opposite sex. Blood also provides nourishment for adult and baby spiders.</p>



<p>But the spiders’ mouthparts are unable to pierce skin or hides, says Fiona Cross, an arachnologist at the University of Canterbury in Christchurch, New Zealand. Instead, the spiders wait for mosquitoes to siphon blood from a person or animal, then the spiders pounce on the flying blood bags . “We call them mosquito terminators,” she says.</p>

<p>While any blood-laden mosquito will do, <em>Anopheles </em>mosquitoes are <em>Evarcha</em>’s favorite, partly because of the mosquito species’ bottoms-up resting pose. While other mosquitoes rest with their abdomens parallel to a surface, <em>Anopheles</em> lift their rears into the air, especially helpful for baby spiders, which are able to creep under the tilted abdomen.</p>



<p>Baby spiders, which “basically resemble dots with eight legs,” scuttle under the mosquito, “leap up, grab the mosquito from underneath, and as the mosquito flies away, the little spiderlings hang on with their little fangs and have just enough venom to bring the mosquito down,” Cross says. “They have the feast of a lifetime.”</p>



<p>But that doesn’t mean gene drives would doom the spiders by eliminating large swaths of the mosquitoes, Cross says. “If <em>Anopheles</em> were wiped from the planet, I would say that the spiders could adapt.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/neutrinos-submarine-nuclear-weapons-fuel-particles">How neutrinos could ensure a submarine’s nuclear fuel isn’t weaponized</a></h4>

              
                <p>Nuclear submarines might provide rogue nations with a path to nuclear weapons. But neutrinos could help reveal attempts to go from boats to bombs.</p>



<p>Neutrinos, lightweight subatomic particles that are released from the reactors that power nuclear subs, could <a href="https://journals.aps.org/prl/accepted/10077Y76Yfd14b7286f46d002a03c5ccd979cb79b">expose the alteration or removal of the nuclear fuel</a> for nefarious purposes, physicists report in a paper accepted in <em>Physical Review Letters</em>. Crucially, this monitoring could be done remotely, while a submarine is in a port with its reactor shut off.</p>





<p>To ensure that countries without nuclear weapons don’t develop them, international inspectors monitor the use of many types of nuclear technology around the world. Nuclear submarines are particularly worrisome. Many use highly enriched uranium, a potent type of fuel that can be weaponized relatively easily. But submarines are protected from monitoring by a loophole. Unlike nuclear power plants, nuclear submarines are used for secretive military purposes, so physical inspections could infringe on a country’s national security.</p>



<p>“Neutrino-based methods can considerably reduce the intrusiveness by making measurements at a distance, without having to physically access the vessel,” says nuclear scientist Igor Jovanovic of the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor, who was not involved with the research.</p>



<p>These particles — specifically their antimatter variety, antineutrinos — stream in droves from operating nuclear reactors. The particles interact feebly with other matter, allowing them to pass through solid material, including a submarine hull. So a neutrino detector placed near a submarine could reveal what’s going on inside, say neutrino physicists Bernadette Cogswell and Patrick Huber of the Center for Neutrino Physics at Virginia Tech in Blacksburg.</p>



<p>Scientists have previously suggested using neutrinos to detect other nuclear misdeeds, such as <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/ghostly-antineutrinos-could-help-ferret-out-nuclear-tests">nuclear weapons tests</a> (<em>SN: 8/20/18</em>).</p>



<p>But submarines, often on the move, are hard to monitor with stationary instruments. When the vessels do sit in port, their nuclear reactors may be turned off. So the researchers came up with a solution: They’d look at neutrinos produced by the decays of varieties of chemical elements, or isotopes, that remain after a reactor shuts down. A detector located in the water about 5 meters underneath the sub’s reactor could measure neutrinos produced in decays of certain cerium and ruthenium isotopes. Those measurements would reveal if nuclear material had been removed or swapped out.</p>



<p>This method of monitoring a reactor that’s off is “very clever,” says physicist Ferenc Dalnoki-Veress of the Middlebury Institute of International Studies at Monterey in California.</p>



<p>But the idea would still require buy-in from each country to agree to detectors in submarine berths. “Something like this would be so much better if it wouldn’t require cooperation,” says physicist Giorgio Gratta of Stanford University.</p>



<p>Submarine monitoring may become more pressing in the near future. So far, all countries that have nuclear submarines already possess nuclear weapons, so the issue was hypothetical. But that’s set to change. The United States and the United Kingdom, two nuclear weapons states, <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/09/15/joint-leaders-statement-on-aukus/">announced last September</a> that they are entering into a cooperative security agreement with Australia and will help the country<strong>,</strong> a non-nuclear weapons state, acquire nuclear submarines.</p>



<p>There’s little suspicion that Australia would use these submarines as a cover for a nuclear weapons program. But “you still have to worry about the precedent that that sets,” Cogswell says. So, she says, monitoring nuclear submarines is newly important. “The question was how the heck to do that.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/glia-nerve-cells-brain-body-spleen-heart-lungs">Glial cells may take on big jobs in unexpected parts of the body</a></h4>

              
                <p class="has-drop-cap">In the theater of the brain, nerve cells have long been cast as the stars, bringing mental scenes to life with their electrical and chemical performances. Yet many of the cellular actors in the human brain are glial cells, presumably the supporting cast and behind-the-scenes stagehands.</p>



<p>In recent decades, though, accumulating evidence has shown that glia are not just minor players that keep the show running. They actually play starring roles in many of the brain’s most important acts, such as remembering, learning and thinking.</p>





<p>And the latest research points to a surprising new setting for the story of glia: outside the brain. Mysterious populations of glia reside in the heart, spleen, lungs and various other organs. But no one knows how they’ll fit into the plot. Early hints suggest the story is going to be riveting.</p>



<p>Already, tantalizing clues are rolling in about what these cells are doing. Glia appear to help regulate the heart’s beating, for instance. Glia in the spleen reside right between nerve cells and immune cells — a perfect spot to influence the connection between health and stress. Exactly what glia are up to in the lungs is unknown, but whatever it is seems important, early experiments suggest — mice with no lung glia die.</p>





<p>“The fact that now there are these new glial cell populations being discovered in unique organs will hopefully trigger a lot of lightbulbs,” says Sarah Ackerman, a neurobiologist at Washington University in St. Louis. Like most researchers who study glia, Ackerman focuses on glia inside the brain.</p>



<p>She sees big potential in the handful of new studies that look at far-flung glia. “There’s going to be a revelation that across all of these organs, there are specialized glia that are supporting the function of the neurons there, but also overall organ health.”</p>



<p>Understanding the roles of glia outside the brain could have big implications for human health, leading to better ways to treat heart disorders, immune system problems and even lung cancer, some scientists suspect.</p>



<p>“If we continue to ignore these cells, it’s only going to slow us down,” says Tawaun Lucas, a neuroimmunologist at Genentech in San Francisco. He recently uncovered details about glia in mouse spleens.</p>



<div class="wp-block-sciencenews-content-sidebar">
<h3>A family affair</h3>



<p>In the brain, several types of glia keep things running. <strong>Microglia</strong> are immune cells that patrol for pathogens, help prune nerve cell connections and more. <strong>Oligodendrocytes</strong> coat nerve fibers in myelin, insulation that speeds messages. <strong>Astrocytes</strong> guide nerve cell growth, regulate blood flow and influence signals between neurons.</p>

<p>It’s too early to know how important glia outside the brain will turn out to be. Maybe these studies on glia represent a burgeoning new field of research. Or maybe the mystery is never solved. “The connection it’s going to have to the conventional world of glia as we know it remains to be seen,” says Bruce Ransom, a neurologist and neuroscientist at the City University of Hong Kong who is also an editor in chief of the scientific journal <em>Glia</em>.</p>



<p>Still, the potential plotlines of these newly described groups of glia are worth following. “We’re always looking for that little opening that you can enlarge and see something really important,” Ransom says. “That’s a possibility here.”</p>



<h4>Immune system meets nervous system</h4>



<p>Glia are named for glue, the sticky substance that exists solely to hold other, more important things together. In the brain, various glia do lots of supporting. Glia called astrocytes keep nerve cells fed. Microglia combat invaders. And oligodendrocytes insulate nerve wires with a fatty substance called myelin. But glia are now known to have much fancier jobs too, including changing the signals that pass between nerve cells, guiding the growth of nerve cells and pruning neural connections called synapses (<em>SN: 8/22/15, p. 18</em>).</p>



<p>Researchers have a good handle on the roles of some glia outside the brain. Enteric glia help the gut digest food, for instance, and a type of glia called Schwann cells, sisters to the brain’s oligodendrocytes, spread myelin on peripheral nerves to help speed signals along. In the skin, specialized <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.aax6452">Schwann cells kick off pain sensations</a>, scientists reported in <em>Science</em> in 2019. Less is known about glia in other organs, such as the spleen glia that intrigue Lucas. Naming these glia can be tricky, since the cells sometimes share similarities with multiple types of other glia. For now, these outsider glia are often lumped into one of two catchall categories, nonmyelinating Schwann cells or satellite glia.</p>

<p>Lucas started out as a neuroscientist at Stanford University, focusing on the brain. Then a mouse under a microscope shifted his attention. The mouse was genetically engineered so that its glia glowed green. As Lucas looked throughout the body, he saw green cells all over, including in the spleen, lymph nodes, kidney, liver and lungs.</p>



<p>His adviser at Stanford, neurologist Marion Buckwalter, was quickly captivated by the spleen glia. “I started reading about the spleen, and I thought, ‘This is really fascinating,’ ” she says. The spleen is packed with immune cells. Like many organs, the spleen also contains nerves that are part of the body’s sympathetic nervous system. This control system can dilate pupils, quicken heart rates and get the body sweating. Often called the “fight-or-flight system,” the sympathetic nervous system flies into action under threats, says Lucas, “whether you get kicked in the head, or are chased by a tiger or have stressful things going on at work.”</p>



<p>The sympathetic nervous system and the immune system converge in the spleen, and glia may be particularly important in this connection. Experiments with the mice revealed <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/glia.23993">big, complex glia in the spleen</a> right alongside message-sending nerve cell axons. And “just microns away, there are immune cells,” Buckwalter says. The spleen’s glia are perfectly positioned to communicate between the nervous system and the immune system, the researchers reported in 2021 in <em>Glia</em>.</p>



<p>By looking at the genetic instructions inside those glia found in the spleen, Lucas and colleagues showed that the spleen’s glia have the cellular equipment to speak the language of both immune cells and nerve cells: They can sense chemical signals made by immune cells <em>and</em> they can sense chemical signals sent by nerve cells. How these cells use this machinery is unknown, but the results position spleen glia to be important communicators. Until Lucas’ experiments, no one had any clues about the glia’s behavior, Buckwalter says.</p>



<p>The possibility of communication between glia, nerve cells and immune cells in the spleen “has potentially huge implications,” Buckwalter says. Stress and brain injuries such as strokes can harm the immune system. After a stroke, for instance, the sympathetic nervous system instigates a die-off of immune cells called B lymphocytes in the spleen, which can lead to dangerous infections. Immune cells also play a role in autoimmune disorders such as multiple sclerosis and rheumatoid arthritis, which can flare up in people who are stressed. If glia influence the immune cells, perhaps their behavior can be tweaked to prevent such flare-ups.</p>

<p>Research so far is preliminary. It’s not yet clear whether these spleen glia are in fact sending messages between the nervous system and the immune system, and if so, what the results of those conversations are. It’s too soon to say with any certainty that glia in people’s spleens are involved in autoimmune disorders, Buckwalter says. But the idea has piqued her interest.</p>



<p>Studying these mysterious cells in organs feels like a different sort of science, she says. It’s harder than just trying to find a missing piece of a puzzle. “It’s like we just got a puzzle, and the pieces aren’t labeled and the box has no picture on it.”</p>



<h4>The beating heart</h4>



<p>A similar puzzle can be found in the heart.</p>



<p>Cody Smith, who studies neural biology at the University of Notre Dame in Indiana, was well aware that the heart was packed with nerve cells. Most nerve cells are thought to have glia nearby, and Smith was eager to find the heart’s glia. Along with graduate student Nina Kikel-Coury, Smith went searching for them. “We really had no idea what to expect,” he says.</p>



<p>It turned out that a population of glia resides in the hearts of zebrafish. Named cardiac nexus glia, these cells appear early in zebrafish development and go on to spread out and form a gossamer-thin <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.3001444">web around the heart</a>, Smith and Kikel-Coury reported last year in <em>PLOS Biology</em>.</p>



<p>In zebrafish, at least, these glia do important work: They guide the development of the heart and regulate heartbeat. When the researchers messed with the cells, the fish’s heart rates increased. That’s an unusual effect, Smith says. Usually, disruptions to heart cells cause heart rates to slow.</p>

<p>By looking at other datasets that catalog the genes active in mouse and human heart cells, the researchers found cells that had similar collections of active genes to the heart glia in the zebrafish. <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.3001444">The shared genes</a> suggest that these glia may be in many species’ hearts. That data “support the idea that they’re in humans,” Smith says.</p>



<p>Some congenital heart disorders have defects in the outflow track of the heart, where blood exits to an artery. That’s also the spot that these glia first appear early in zebrafish development. It’s possible, Smith says, that these glia may be involved in human heart trouble. “We’re at such an early phase of this work,” he cautions. “I wish we had more answers.”</p>



<h4>The plot thickens</h4>



<p>Investigations of glia in the spleen and brain are just the beginning. Organs throughout the body may rely on glia, other research hints. Glia have <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4601129/">turned up in the lungs</a>, for instance, found there in mice by Buckwalter and Gabriela Suarez-Mier, a graduate student when the work was done.</p>



<p>Lung glia may be involved in breathing and oxygen exchange in capillaries, Lucas says, but details are slim. Those glia are crucial, Lucas’ preliminary experiments suggest: When researchers use a toxin to kill the glia in the lungs, “all of the animals die.”</p>



<p>In his current work, Lucas is studying glia’s potential role in cancer. Tumors in lungs (and also in the liver and pancreas) have nerves that attach to them, and glia wrap themselves around those nerves, Lucas says. In a lab dish, other researchers have found, <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25106646/#:~:text=Results%3A%20Schwann%20cells%20migrated%20toward,Schwann%20and%20pancreatic%20cancer%20cells.">Schwann cells will grow toward cancer cells</a>. So the behavior of glia that linger near a tumor is now an important question, Lucas says.</p>

<h3>Getting air</h3>



<p>In a mouse lung, glia (green) wrap around thick nerve bundles (<strong>a</strong>) that travel down the lung and meshlike nerves that surround large and small bronchi (<strong>b</strong> and <strong>c</strong>). Glia also wrap around blood vessel nerves (<strong>d</strong>) and small airways (<strong>e</strong>). This varied anatomy hints at some of the ways that lung glia might help with oxygen exchange.</p>

<p>Understanding the body’s glia and possibly enlisting them to fight disease will require more than a surface-level understanding. Techniques that reveal how individual cells use different collections of genes promise a deeper view of glia in the body. Other genetic labeling methods offer a way to monitor these mystifying glia in living animals. “The tools are going to allow us to go from, ‘OK, they’re there,’ to ‘What are they doing?’ ” says Ackerman, the neurobiologist at Washington University.</p>



<p>Glia biologists looking beyond the brain are still very much at the beginning of their script. “What cells are here and how do they work together?” Lucas asks. “We’re starting from square one.”</p>



<p>Being outside the brain puts these glia in a good position to be possible targets for therapies, Ackerman says. The brain is hard to reach with drugs, as it’s ensconced in its protective blood-brain barrier. Brain cells are also less able to repair themselves than cells in the peripheral nervous system. “We might be able to affect positive change in a more efficient way than trying to direct repair in the brain or the spinal cord,” she says.</p>



<p>It’s too soon to say whether glia outside the brain are part of the same story as the brain’s glia. The variety of glia residing outside the brain might all end up being individual bits of disparate biology, never coalescing into a plot that’s relevant for the entire nervous system, says Ransom, of the City University of Hong Kong. “I think it’s exciting and interesting work, and I think it’s completely justified to study it entirely,” he says. For now, there’s no telling where glia’s story will take us.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/supercomputer-exascale-frontier-speed-record-computing-calculations">The world’s fastest supercomputer just broke the exascale barrier</a></h4>

              
                <p>The first exascale computer has officially arrived.</p>



<p>The world’s fastest supercomputer performed <a href="https://www.top500.org/news/ornls-frontier-first-to-break-the-exaflop-ceiling/">more than a quintillion calculations per second</a>, entering the realm of exascale computing. That’s according to a ranking of the world’s speediest supercomputers called the <a href="https://www.top500.org/lists/top500/2022/06/">TOP500</a>, announced on May 30. The computer, known as Frontier, is the first exascale computer to be included on the biannual list.</p>



<p>Exascale computing is expected to allow for new advances in a variety of scientific fields that depend on vastly complex calculations. The exascale milestone “represents an unprecedented capability for researchers around the world to use the computer to ask their specific scientific questions,” says Frontier’s project director Justin Whitt&nbsp;of Oak Ridge National Laboratory in Tennessee.</p>





<p>Oak Ridge&#8217;s Frontier clocked in at about 1.1 exaflops, or 1.1 quintillion operations per second. Frontier beat out the previous record-holder, a supercomputer called Fugaku at the RIKEN Center for Computational Science in Kobe, Japan, which achieved more than 0.4 exaflops.</p>



<p>While <a href="https://www.hpcwire.com/2021/11/24/three-chinese-exascale-systems-detailed-at-sc21-two-operational-and-one-delayed/">tentative reports</a> have suggested that some Chinese supercomputers are already achieving exascale performance, they have not been reported on the TOP500 ranking so far.</p>



<p>After about three years of development, Frontier will be ready for scientists to begin using it at the end of 2022. With its new exascale capability, researchers aim to simulate how stars explode, calculate the properties of subatomic particles, investigate new energy sources such as nuclear fusion and harness artificial intelligence to improve the diagnosis and prevention of disease, among many other research topics.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/covid-dog-detection-pcr-test-screening-coronavirus">Trained dogs sniff out COVID-19 as well as lab tests do</a></h4>

              
                <p>Dogs are as reliable as laboratory tests for detecting COVID-19 cases, and may be even better than PCR tests for identifying infected people who don’t have symptoms. A bonus: The canines are cuter and less invasive than a swab up the nose.</p>



<p>In a study involving sweat samples from 335 people, trained dogs <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0268382">sniffed out 97 percent of&nbsp; the coronavirus cases</a> that had been identified by PCR tests, researchers report June 1 in <em>PLOS One</em>. And the dogs found all 31 COVID-19 cases among 192 people who didn’t have symptoms.</p>





<p>These findings are evidence that dogs could be effective for mass screening efforts at places such as airports or concerts and may provide friendly alternatives for testing people who balk at nasal swabs, says Dominique Grandjean, a veterinarian at the National School of Veterinary Medicine of Alfort in Maisons-Alfort, France.</p>



<p>“The dog doesn’t lie,” but there are many ways PCR tests can go wrong, Grandjean says. The canines’ noses also identified more COVID-19 cases than did <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coronavirus-covid-19-testing-questions-vaccines-variants-accuracy">antigen tests</a> (<em>SN: 12/17/21</em>), similar to many at-home tests, but sometimes mistook another respiratory virus for the coronavirus, Grandjean and colleagues found. What’s more, anecdotal evidence suggests the dogs can pick up asymptomatic cases as much as 48 hours before people test positive by PCR, he says.</p>



<p>In the study, dogs from French fire stations and from the Ministry of the Interior of the United Arab Emirates were trained in coronavirus detection by rewarding them with toys — usually tennis balls. “It’s playtime for them,” Grandjean says. It takes about three to six weeks, depending on the dog’s experience with odor detection, to train a dog to pick out COVID-19 cases from sweat samples.</p>



<p>The dogs then sniffed cones housing sweat samples collected from human volunteers’ underarms. Swabbing the sweat off the back of people’s necks or giving the woofers a whiff of used face masks worked just as well, Grandjean says.</p>



<p>Those results indicate that odors from multiple body sites can be used for canine screening, says Kenneth Furton, a forensic chemist at Florida International University in Miami who was not involved in the study.</p>

<p>The results are similar to previous, smaller studies that also found that dogs perform as well as or even better than PCR tests for detecting SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, Furton says. He and colleagues have used dogs at schools, a music festival and in a small trial screening airline employees for coronavirus infections.</p>



<p>One of the biggest advantages dogs have over other tests is their speed, Furton says. “Even with what we call a rapid test, you’re still going to have to wait tens of minutes or even hours, where the dog in a matter of seconds or even fractions of seconds can make a response.”</p>



<p>It’s not clear exactly what dogs are smelling when they detect COVID-19 or other diseases, says Cynthia Otto, director of the University of Pennsylvania School of Veterinary Medicine’s working dog center, who was not involved in the study. It may not be a single chemical, but rather a pattern of increasing and decreasing levels of certain aromas. “It’s not like you could create an odor perfume bottle that would be the scent of COVID,” she says.</p>



<p>Even with repeated studies demonstrating dogs’ COVID-detection prowess, some doctors, scientists and government officials have been skeptical of the claims, Grandjean says. He finds the reluctance puzzling, because dogs are already used to sniff out drugs and explosives, and are being tested for detecting other diseases, such as cancer, he says. “Every time you take a plane, it’s because dogs have been sniffing your luggage [and found] no explosives. So you trust them when you take a plane, but you don’t want to trust them for COVID?”</p>



<p>One challenge with dogs, says Furton, is that people don’t think of them as high-tech the way electronic sensors are. “But dogs are one of the highest-tech devices we have. They’re just biological sensors, instead of electronic sensors,” he says.</p>



<p>Another drawback for dogs is that they take time to train and there currently aren’t even enough dogs trained to detect explosives, let alone diseases, Otto says. And “dogs that work well in that lab setting may not work well in a people setting,” she says. Handlers can also influence the dog’s response and must be able to read the dog well, she says. “We need more good dogs.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/sun-hedgehog-solar-orbiter-flare">The Solar Orbiter spacecraft spotted a ‘hedgehog’ on the sun</a></h4>

              
                <p>A spacecraft has spied a spiky “hedgehog” on the sun and watched a solar flare in ways never done before.</p>



<p>The Solar Orbiter, a collaboration between the European Space Agency and NASA, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/esas-solar-orbiter-will-be-the-first-spacecraft-to-study-the-suns-polar-zones">launched in February 2020</a> and is now looping around our star (<em>SN: 2/9/20</em>). On May 18, researchers released images from the spacecraft’s closest solar flyby yet. That flyby took place March 26 when the orbiter flew within about 48 million kilometers of the sun, closer than Mercury is.</p>





<p>“This is amazing to have this sort of data already,” says solar physicist David Berghmans of the Royal Observatory of Belgium in Brussels.</p>



<p>The observations show a feature nicknamed the hedgehog, due to its spikes of darker, cooler gas atop hotter material. “‘Cool’ is relative here, with respect to the 1-million-degree background [plasma],” says Berghmans, the principal investigator of the orbiter’s Extreme Ultraviolet Imager. The scientists don’t know what causes this feature, but think it’s related to <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/realigning-magnetic-fields-may-drive-sun-spiky-plasma-tendrils">long, thin jets of solar material called spicules</a> (<em>SN: 11/14/19</em>)<em>.</em></p>

<p>Several days before spying the 25,000-kilometer-wide hedgehog, four of Solar Orbiter’s instruments detected an X-ray flare and observed how it affected nearby space. This is what the spacecraft was built to do, Berghmans says.</p>



<p>The spacecraft’s focus is “connection science,” he says. Solar Orbiter’s instruments detected the solar flare, the shock wave it created and the produced burst of charged particles and radio signals — one after another — over several hours. Previously, different telescopes would detect these separately over days.</p>



<p>By connecting the sequence of events into “a complete story,” Berghmans says, scientists can better predict the outflows of those charged particles, which are especially dangerous to astronauts, satellites and even high-flying aircraft.</p>



<p>The spacecraft will pass close to the sun roughly every five to six months through 2026. Then, for three more years, the orbiter will swing closer to the sun’s poles, providing scientists with their first head-on views of those regions.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/great-white-sharks-megalodon-food-competition-extinction">Great white sharks may have helped drive megalodons to extinction</a></h4>

              
                <p>For millions of years, megalodon sharks were top ocean predators — and then came the great whites. New analyses of teeth hint that competition for food from great white sharks may have helped give the megatoothed giants an extra shove toward extinction.</p>



<p>Scientists reconstructed shark feeding habits by analyzing zinc in the teeth of 20 living shark species and 13 extinct species, including megalodons (<em>Otodus megalodon</em>). Megalodons and great whites <a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-022-30528-9">occupied a similar ecological niche</a>, devouring marine mammals such as whales and seals, the researchers report May 31 in <em>Nature Communications</em>.</p>





<p><em>O. megalodon</em> was one of the largest carnivores ever to live, growing to <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/newborn-megalodon-sharks-fossils-larger-most-adult-humans">at least 14 meters</a> long (<em>SN: 1/12/21</em>). This giant began menacing the oceans around 23 million years ago. When — and why — it went extinct isn’t clear. The species may have lingered until about 2.6 million years ago. Or it may have vanished <a href="https://peerj.com/articles/6088/">as early as 3.5 million years ago</a>, right around the time that the great white shark <em>Carcharodon carcharias</em> appeared.</p>



<p>To figure out if the two sharks dined on similar food, the researchers turned to zinc, which has two main forms: zinc-66 and zinc-64. The relative abundances of those isotopes, preserved in tooth enamel, can indicate an animal’s position in a food web. Plants — and plant eaters — are relatively high in zinc-66. Higher up the food chain, that 66-to-64 ratio decreases.</p>



<p>The analyses revealed that when and where <em>O. megalodon</em> and <em>C. carcharias</em> overlapped, the sharks had similar ratios. That finding suggests that their diets overlapped too, say geoscientist Jeremy McCormack of the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology in Leipzig, Germany, and colleagues.</p>



<p>Still, that the sharks consumed similar prey isn’t proof they were in competition, the researchers say. And there are many <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/what-meg-movie-gets-wrong-right-about-megalodon-sharks">factors that may have helped drive megalodons to extinction</a> (<em>SN: 8/10/18</em>). Those factors include ocean circulation changes, collapsing prey populations and competition for food with other ocean creatures, like orcas.</p>
