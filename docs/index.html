                <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/covid-19-coronavirus-vaccine-trial-volunteer-sophia-upshaw">Meet Sophia Upshaw, a volunteer in a coronavirus vaccine trial</a></h4>

<p>Scientists are racing
to develop and test vaccines that can protect
people from the coronavirus. One particularly swift effort, sponsored by the
National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, involves a vaccine
called mRNA-1273, made by pharmaceutical company Moderna, Inc., in Cambridge,
Mass. </p>



<p>Traditional vaccines use a
weakened or inactive version of viruses or their parts to spark an immune response. In contrast, mRNA-1273 contains genetic material
called messenger RNA, which carries instructions for making one of the
coronavirus’s proteins. The idea is that human cells will take those
instructions and make this viral protein. Then, the body will learn how to
produce antibodies that target the protein, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/new-coronavirus-vaccine-development-process-accelerating">jump-starting an immune reaction</a> against the real thing, should it ever be encountered
(<em>SN: 2/21/20</em>). </p>



<p>Two research sites — Kaiser
Permanente Washington Health Research Institute in Seattle and Emory
University’s Vaccine and Treatment Evaluation Unit in Atlanta — have begun
testing the safety of the vaccine in 45 participants. </p>



<p><em>Science News</em>
spoke to Sophia Upshaw, a 22-year-old graduate student in Atlanta who recently
received the first of two doses of the experimental vaccine. She’ll have
regular clinic visits for the duration of the study, which will last about 14
months. Her responses have been edited for clarity.</p>





<p><strong><em>SN: </em></strong><strong>Why did you volunteer to participate in
the study?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Upshaw:</strong> It’s something that I could do. We are all feeling helpless, and trying to help in any way we can, whether it’s donating masks or 3-D printing masks or volunteering at the hospital if you’re a nurse. Everyone is trying to do what they can. </p>



<p><strong><em>SN: </em>How did you hear about the study, and how quickly were you
enrolled? </strong></p>



<p><strong>Upshaw:</strong> I heard about it the week of March 16 from some other labs. I called and asked if I could be screened for the study on March 20, and I came in for my first screening on the 23rd. Wednesday, [the 25th], is when they approved me for the study, and then Friday the 27th is when I got my first vaccination. It was very quick.</p>





<p><strong><em>SN: </em>Did the shot hurt? </strong></p>



<p><strong>Upshaw:</strong> The pain was very similar to when you get a flu shot. I felt the pinch and the burn as they were injecting it. Then they took it out, and I said, “Oh, that’s it?” My shoulder was sore for the whole day. The soreness developed throughout the day. On May 24th, I have my second injection. </p>



<p><strong><em>SN: </em>Are there risks you’re worried about? </strong></p>



<p><strong>Upshaw:</strong> One of the big risks is the possibility of developing symptoms similar to COVID. That was one big worry that I had. But this particular vaccine doesn’t have the actual inactive virus. It has genetic material that [carries instructions] for a protein that’s found on the virus. It basically tricks your body into thinking you have it.</p>



<p>I’m still slightly worried. Today is day nine or 10 now after
the first injection, and I’m feeling fine. I was borderline feverish, but I
never reached the threshold for a medical-grade fever. </p>

</h4>
</aside>



<p><strong><em>SN: </em></strong><strong>How does your family feel about your
participation? </strong></p>



<p><strong>Upshaw:</strong> They were really worried, but they call and check in on me every day to see how I’m doing. They’re a lot more comforted and relaxed now that they see I haven’t [developed complications]. They are happy that people are choosing to participate in the trial. They’re just not happy that it’s me. </p>



<p><strong><em>SN:</em> Anything else you’d like to share?</strong> </p>



<p>Upshaw: A lot of people are wondering why there isn’t a
vaccine yet. I saw a lot of that on social media — people wondering how long
it’s going to take. I think part of the reason I want to share my story is to
tell people, “Hey, people are trying their best.”</p>



<p>It’s a different perspective to see the doctors and nurses involved in the vaccine trial and how hard they’re working. It’s amazing to see their dedication to this. This has dominated their work right now. I’m really appreciative of their work, and how well they’ve treated me and everyone in the vaccine trial to make us feel comfortable.… I’m very grateful to be a part of [the trial]. We’ll see how things turn out in a year or so. That seems like a long way away.  </p>

<p><a href="https://amzn.to/2y6Q56n">The Alchemy of Us</a><br /><em>Ainissa Ramirez</em><br /><em>MIT Press, $27.95</em></p>



<p>Humans have
continually wielded materials, from steel to silicon, in new ways to send technology
leaping forward. But those technologies have unintentionally molded our bodies
and society, materials scientist and science writer Ainissa Ramirez argues in <em>The
Alchemy of Us</em>. </p>



<p>Increasingly precise
clocks — based on steel springs and then quartz crystals — kept society humming
along in unison. But with the Industrial Revolution’s focus on factory
schedules, humans became ever more obsessed with time, and our sleep habits
suffered. Likewise, electric lights made with carbon filaments let people work
and play for longer hours, but upset circadian rhythms, with a variety of <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/out-sync-body-clock-causes-more-woes-sleepiness">negative
health impacts</a> (<em>SN: 10/17/16</em>).</p>





<p>But the knock-on effects haven’t
been all bad: Telegraph wires of iron and copper
allowed news to travel quickly across the United States beginning in the
1840s. The technology’s demand for short communications helped shape the
clipped style of American newspapers, whose
reporters used the technology to send dispatches from afar. That style
inspired the concise, clear prose of Ernest Hemingway, Ramirez argues. </p>



<p>Packed with
engaging, little-known stories from the history of science,
the book provides sharp, straightforward explanations of the materials science
behind these tales. Ramirez carefully selects the characters in her narratives,
making for a refreshing departure from the lone scientific genius trope.
Instead, we meet Ruth Belville, who carried around a highly accurate pocket
watch and “sold time” in early 20th century England, and chemist Caroline
Hunter and photographer Ken Williams, Polaroid employees who in the 1970s
fought their employer over the use of
instant photography to monitor South Africans during apartheid. </p>





<p>Bucking the tendency for hero
worship in histories of science, Ramirez
notes the failings of the figures she profiles. For example, Samuel Morse, known for his work on the
telegraph, supported slavery and railed against immigrants.</p>



<p>The author’s excitement is
infectious: As she raves about the
“marvelous metamorphosis that occurs when carbon combines with iron” to
make steel, the substance suddenly seems wondrous, with cakelike layers that
make it both malleable and strong. Steel
reappears in later chapters, weaving into stories of technologies that hinged on
improved steel production. </p>



<p>The connections Ramirez draws between seemingly disparate ideas in science and culture are engaging. Throughout the book, the message is somber, but hopeful: Materials change us in ways we hadn’t expected. But by being aware of these effects, society can choose how to respond.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/first-black-hole-image-event-horizon-telescope-coronavirus">A year after the first black hole image, the EHT has been stymied by the coronavirus</a></h4>

<p>The scientists behind the
first picture of a black hole are squeezing everything they can from the data
they’ve got. </p>



<p>A year after <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/black-hole-first-picture-event-horizon-telescope">presenting a portrait of the supermassive black hole
in the galaxy M87</a> (<em>SN: 4/10/19</em>),
the Event Horizon Telescope team faces a two-year data drought, thanks to
technical snafus, security snags and a global pandemic.</p>



<p>“The coronavirus has set us
back a bit,” says astrophysicist Shep Doeleman of the Harvard-Smithsonian
Center for Astrophysics in Cambridge, Mass., and the founding director of the
EHT. “Nothing is immune, not even black holes.” </p>



<p>The delay may push back answering
questions about how black holes shoot speedy jets of charged particles into
space, and could postpone our getting a clear view of the black hole at the
center of the Milky Way. But the team is still analyzing existing data and making
plans to expand the observatory in the future.</p>





<p>The EHT is a <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/event-horizon-telescope-black-hole-picture">global network of radio telescopes</a> that, together, form a telescope that’s effectively
the size of the Earth (<em>SN: 4/10/19</em>).
Spanning the globe lets the EHT zoom in on a black hole’s event horizon, the
region beyond which not even light can escape.</p>





<p>Last year, the EHT team revealed
the first direct image of a black hole’s event horizon: an <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/new-telescopes-could-help-spot-photon-ring-black-hole-ever-imaged">asymmetric ring of light</a> representing the shadow of the black hole on a
glowing disk of plasma that orbits it (<em>SN: 3/18/20</em>). The image, of the
event horizon of M87’s supermassive black hole, was made entirely from data the
observatory took in 2017, with seven telescopes at five sites around the world.
(An eighth telescope, the South Pole Telescope in Antarctica, was part of the
EHT at the time, but M87 is not visible from the South Pole.)</p>



<p>The results provided
stunning confirmations of parts of Einstein’s theory of general relativity and
bolstered physicists’ understanding of black holes across the universe. But
some surprising pieces were missing: M87’s supermassive black hole shoots jets
of plasma light-years into space, yet the EHT saw no sign of them. </p>



<p>And although the telescope
observed the black hole at the center of the Milky Way galaxy, Sagittarius A*,
the results were so confusing that team chose not to publish them at the time. Sgr
A* is much smaller than the black hole at the center of M87, which means that the
material in the bright disk around Sgr A* whips around much faster than M87’s
does. As a result, Sgr A* changed its appearance too quickly for the
researchers to release a single still image in 2019, although <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/black-hole-image-event-horizon-telescope-top-science-stories-2019-yir">they still hope to make a movie</a> (<em>SN: 12/16/19</em>).</p>



<p>In 2020, the scientists had
hoped to bring the total number of observatories in the EHT network to 11,
adding the Kitt Peak observatory in Arizona, the NOEMA array in the French Alps
and the Greenland Telescope. The team also planned to start observing at higher
frequencies of radio emission, which can penetrate the plasma surrounding black
holes more easily.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img alt="NOEMA radio telescope array" class="wp-image-3086868" src="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/040920_lg_eht_inline1_680.jpg" /><span class="caption wp-caption-3086868">The NOEMA radio telescope array in the French Alps was supposed to join the Event Horizon Telescope’s global network in 2020, but those plans have been put on hold due to COVID-19.</span><span class="credit wp-credit-3086868">IRAM Institute</span></figure>



<p>“I think that’s kind of a
game changer,” says EHT team member Kazu Akiyama, an astrophysicist at the MIT
Haystack Observatory in Westford, Mass., of those future observations. Adding
more sites would provide sharper images, letting the team zoom in on M87’s jets.
And peering through plasma in the Milky Way that’s between Earth and Sgr A*, about
25,640 light-years away, could help clarify astronomers’ view of our own
neighboring supermassive black hole. </p>



<p>But the 2020 observations,
scheduled for March 25 through April 5, were canceled due to the coronavirus
pandemic. The team had performed a dry run as recently as January, sending
astronomers to some of the most remote parts of the globe to make sure the
telescopes were ready. But by the time astronomers would have had to set out to
the observatories again, travel restrictions and lockdowns were in effect
around the world. </p>



<p>“It was only with the
greatest reluctance, but with safety paramount, that we canceled the observations,”
Doeleman says. “We’re happy to be part of the solution, actually, by not
traveling. But it is still heartbreaking.”</p>



<p>The 2019 run was also
canceled for a variety of reasons, from technical issues to bad weather to <a href="https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2019/02/violence-and-insecurity-threaten-mexican-telescopes">fuel thieves</a>
blocking the road to the Large Millimeter Telescope in Mexico. “It was the
right decision, given that we expected we would run in 2020,” Doeleman says.</p>



<p>So the team is left sifting
through data that are at least two years old. Luckily, there is still a lot to
learn from that info.</p>



<p>“We still have a lot of
excellent science even in the 2017 dataset,” says EHT deputy director Michael
Hecht of Haystack Observatory. And “the 2018 dataset is mostly unutilized to
this point.” </p>



<p>One result from the 2017
data is the sharpest view yet of a pair of jets zipping away from a
supermassive black hole in a galaxy called 3C 279. Unlike M87, which is a
relative neighbor at about 55 million light-years from Earth, 3C 279 sends its
light from about 5 billion light-years away. That great distance let
astronomers see features of the black hole’s jet that are too close to see at
M87.</p>



<p>“We’re really looking at the
deepest region of the jet … because we have a very sharp eye,” Akiyama says. At
just a few light-years from the black hole’s maw, <a href="https://www.aanda.org/articles/aa/abs/forth/aa37493-20/aa37493-20.html">the jet is already moving at about 99.5 percent the
speed of light</a>, the EHT team reports
April 7 in <em>Astronomy &amp;
Astrophysics</em><em>.</em> Astronomers have seen such
jets zooming along at extremely high speeds far from their black holes, but it
was thought that the jets needed more of a runway to accelerate to such great
speeds.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="alignright size-full"><img alt="Supermassive black hole with jets" class="wp-image-3086867" src="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/040920_lg_eht_inline2_680.jpg" /><span class="caption wp-caption-3086867">Data that the Event Horizon Telescope gathered in 2017 showed something new: High-energy jets (shown) fleeing a supermassive black hole in the galaxy 3C 279 at about 99.5 percent the speed of light.</span><span class="credit wp-credit-3086867">J. -Y Kim <em>et al</em>/<em>Astronomy &amp; Astrophysics </em>2020</span></figure></div>



<p>“What was surprising is that,
even for the inner region of the jet, the jet is already accelerated very close
to lightspeed,” the maximum speed at which matter can move, Akiyama says.</p>



<p>The team is also still
working on parsing the structure of the magnetic field near M87’s giant black
hole, which will be a clue to how that black hole’s jets form. The researchers
are hoping to publish details about Sgr A* by the end of 2020, Akiyama says,
although he couldn’t say what.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, Doeleman is
looking to the future. Over the next decade, he and his colleagues hope to add
another 10 or so telescopes to the network to build the “next-generation” EHT. </p>



<p>The present-day EHT uses
telescopes that already existed, and the team had to make its observations work
from wherever those telescopes happen to be. “We were a little opportunistic at
the beginning,” Doeleman says. Now that the scientists know that the EHT works,
they can place smaller telescopes wherever they want — including, perhaps, in
space — to get even better views of black holes. </p>



<p>“The announcement last year showed everyone what the EHT is capable of,” Doeleman says. “We have a freedom we didn’t have before.” </p>

                <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/covid-19-can-fabric-cloth-masks-stem-coronavirus-spread">Can fabric masks stem the coronavirus’ spread?</a></h4>

<p>People across the United
States are donning homemade masks in an effort to curb transmission of the
coronavirus. But there isn’t enough data to know for sure whether such cloth masks
will prevent an infected person from spreading the virus to someone else,
experts say. </p>



<p>In the face of evidence that
the coronavirus may <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coronavirus-covid-19-breathing-talking-enough-spread-airborne">spread by talking and breathing</a>,
on top of coughing or sneezing, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention recommended April 3 that people cover their faces with cloth or
fabric when going out in public (<em>SN:
4/2/20</em>). </p>



<p>Cloth may cut down on some
large respiratory droplets from a cough or sneeze, but it’s unclear whether it
will also catch smaller droplets called aerosols that are released by just
breathing or talking.</p>



<p>Cloth masks, as well as surgical masks, are designed to
protect others from virus spread by the mask wearer, not the other way around. Those infected with the virus that causes COVID-19 can transmit it
to others <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coronavirus-most-contagious-before-during-first-week-symptoms">before they begin showing symptoms</a> (<em>SN: 3/13/20</em>). When the masks are worn as a general habit, they aim to prevent
people who are unaware that they are sick from unwittingly transmitting the
virus to others. Wearing a mask is not meant to be a replacement for social
distancing, handwashing and other efforts. </p>







<p>But <a href="https://www.nap.edu/catalog/25776/rapid-expert-consultation-on-the-effectiveness-of-fabric-masks-for-the-covid-19-pandemic-april-8-2020">there are few studies evaluating the effectiveness of fabric masks</a> at preventing respiratory diseases from spreading, researchers
from the U.S. National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine wrote in
an April 8 letter to the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy. </p>



<p>Those that do exist suggest
that fabric masks may capture large respiratory droplets, like those from a
cough or a sneeze. Those made of different types of cloth have a wide-ranging
ability to filter virus-sized particles, with a trade-off between filtration
and ability to breathe. </p>



<p>In one study, a mask that
used 16 layers of handkerchief fabric was able to filter out 63 percent of 300-nanometer-sized
particles. (The coronavirus is between 50 to 200 nanometers in diameter.) But
that mask was harder to breathe with compared with thick, tight-fitting N95
respirators, often used in hospitals, that can block minuscule particles. Wearing
a cloth mask with that many layers would be uncomfortable and may “cause some
to pass out,” the researchers wrote in the letter. </p>

<p>Surgical masks are somewhat less
mysterious. Those masks may help <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0843-2">reduce
transmission of influenza and seasonal coronaviruses</a> that cause
common colds from people with symptoms, researchers report April 3 in <em>Nature Medicine</em>. Researchers quantified
the amount of virus exhaled by participants both with and without a surgical
mask over 30 minutes. </p>



<p>Those <a href="https://www.fda.gov/medical-devices/personal-protective-equipment-infection-control/n95-respirators-and-surgical-masks-face-masks">masks</a> significantly reduced the amount of detectable influenza virus in respiratory droplet particles, as well as the amount of seasonal coronaviruses in aerosols.</p>



<p>Regardless of how well they
work, the success of cloth or surgical masks at protecting others depends on
whether people wear the gear properly —
including keeping it in place — and
making sure it doesn’t get too wet. Moisture, such as from breathing, can trap
virus in a mask and make it a strong source of contamination when the wearer
takes it off. </p>



<p>Though the evidence for fabric masks is sparse, <a href="https://www.bmj.com/content/bmj/369/bmj.m1435.full.pdf">health officials should still encourage people to wear face masks</a>, other researchers write in an April 9 analysis in the<em> BMJ. </em>Limited protection could still save lives. “As with parachutes for jumping out of aeroplanes, it is time to act” without waiting for evidence, the authors say. </p>

<p>Sometimes, two dimensions are better
than three.</p>



<p>In the three-dimensional world we live
in, there are two classes of elementary particles: bosons and fermions. But in
two dimensions, theoretical physicists predict, there’s another option: anyons.
Now, scientists report new evidence that anyons exist and that they behave
unlike any known particle. Using a tiny “collider,” researchers <a href="https://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/doi/10.1126/science.aaz5601">flung presumed anyons at one another</a> to help confirm their identities, physicists report
in the April 10 <em>Science</em>.</p>



<p>All known elementary particles can be
classified either fermions or bosons. Electrons, for example, are fermions. Bosons
include photons, which are particles of light, and the <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/higgs-found">famed Higgs boson</a>, which
explains how particles get mass (<em>SN:
7/4/12</em>). The two classes behave differently: Fermions are loners and avoid
one another, while bosons can clump together.</p>



<p>Then, about 40 years ago, “theoreticians
predicted that in a two-dimensional world, you could have new particles with different
behaviors called anyons,” says physicist Gwendal Fève of the Laboratoire de
Physique de l’Ecole Normale Supérieure in Paris.</p>





<p>Anyons fall somewhere in between bosons
and fermions, not entirely avoiding one another or clumping up. Since we don’t
live in two dimensions, Fève and colleagues searched for anyons within a 2-D layer
of material. There, anyons could show up as “quasiparticles,” <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/quasiparticles-help-physicists-make-sense-world">disturbances within a solid material</a> that behave like particles (<em>SN: 10/3/14</em>). Such quasiparticles can form when gangs of electrons emulate
another variety of particle, sort of like how a school of fish can move in a
coordinated fashion to mimic a strange, shimmery creature, confusing predators.</p>



<p>Scientists have already seen evidence
for anyons within 2-D materials in a strong magnetic field. Quasiparticles in
these materials have a charge that is a fraction of an electron’s, as predicted
for anyons. But scientists hadn’t yet confirmed that the quasiparticles fully
qualify as anyons: Researchers hadn’t seen the expected bunching behavior in
between that of bosons and fermions.</p>



<p>In the new experiment, anyons traveled within
a 2-D plane sandwiched inside a layered material. The researchers created two
streams of anyons, directed so that they would collide in the center and then
exit along one of two paths.</p>



<p>If the researchers had been colliding antisocial
fermions, the particles would have gone their separate ways after the collision.
Bosons, on the other hand, would tend to clump at same exit. In the experiment,
the researchers saw clumping, but the amount of clumping, and how it changed as
the scientists varied the rate at which anyons were sent into the collider, was
consistent with theoretical predictions for anyons. </p>



<p>“It’s quite conclusive. It’s a very
carefully performed experiment, and it’s a very hard experiment,” says
theoretical physicist Bernd Rosenow of the University of Leipzig in Germany. In
2016, he and colleagues had <a href="https://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.116.156802">proposed such an experiment</a> in a study in <em>Physical
Review Letters</em>. </p>



<p>When anyons swap places or loop around
one another, physicists predict, the quasiparticles’ quantum states are altered.
Identifying this process, known as braiding, would more fully clinch the case
for the existence of anyons, says physicist Chetan Nayak of Microsoft Quantum
and the University of California, Santa Barbara.</p>



<p>Braiding some types of anyons may be a useful
technique for <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/quantum-computers-are-about-get-real">building better quantum computers</a> (<em>SN: 6/29/17</em>).
Current versions of those computers are highly susceptible to mistakes slipping
into calculations. Like a neat plait that keeps unruly hair in line, braided
anyons could store information in a manner that is resistant to such errors.</p>



<p>Although the new study hasn’t demonstrated braiding, it gets scientists a step closer to understanding anyons. “It’s a beautiful experiment. It is definitely going beyond what was done in the past,” Nayak says. </p>

<p>Four fossilized molar teeth excavated in Peru’s Amazon basin
come from a now-extinct lineage of primates that rafted across the Atlantic
Ocean from Africa and reached the inland site between around 35 million and 32
million years ago, researchers say.</p>



<p>Until now, South American sites had yielded only fossils of
primates ancestral to those inhabiting the continent today. Fossils from the
same Peruvian site had previously suggested that <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/monkeys-reached-americas-about-36-million-years-ago">ancestors
of modern South American monkeys</a> crossed the ocean from Africa by around 36
million years ago (<em>SN: 2/4/15</em>). The
new discovery adds a second group of primate arrivals. </p>



<p>The teeth closely resemble those of parapithecids, a primate
family that inhabited northern Africa from roughly 56 million to 23 million
years ago, say paleontologist Erik Seiffert of the University of Southern
California in Los Angeles and his colleagues. Like ancestors of living South
American monkeys, <a href="https://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/doi/10.1126/science.aba1135">parapithecids
must have made a sea crossing</a> on vegetation mats created by storms, the
scientists conclude in the April 10 <em>Science</em>.</p>



<p>Favorable ocean currents and a narrower Atlantic Ocean than
today because of lower sea levels helped ancient primates float across the ocean.
Still, the Atlantic probably was more than 1,500 to 2,000 kilometers wide when
crossings occurred, the scientists say.</p>



<p>The two primate lines adjusted well to a new continent, traveling
from where they landed in South America more than 4,000 kilometers to the inland
Peruvian site, the researchers say. Seiffert’s group suspects both groups
competed for resources until <em>Ucayalipithecus</em>,
the genus name given to the newly reported fossils, eventually died out.</p>

<p>The arrival of spring in the Northern
Hemisphere has raised hopes that warmer and wetter weather might slow or even
stop the COVID-19 pandemic, at least until fall. But don’t plan on
that happening, U.S.
health experts say. </p>



<p>“One should not assume that we are going to be rescued by a
change in the weather. You must assume that the virus will continue to do its
thing,” Anthony Fauci, director of the U.S. National
Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases in Bethesda, Md., and a member of
the White House coronavirus task force, said during an interview April 9 on ABC’s
<em>Good Morning America</em>. </p>



<p>A report released April 7 by the National Academies of
Sciences, Engineering and Medicine also says that, while much about the virus
remains unknown, summer temperatures probably <a href="https://www.nap.edu/read/25771/chapter/1">won’t
do much to dampen the spread</a> of the virus.  </p>



<p>While scientists still don’t know
if <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coronavirus-questions-covid19-symptoms-deaths-spread">touching shared
surfaces</a> is a major driver of the pandemic, compared with direct <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coronavirus-covid-19-breathing-talking-enough-spread-airborne">person-to-person
transmission</a> (<em>SN: 3/4/20</em>; <em>SN: 4/2/20</em>), understanding how the virus
fares in different environmental conditions could provide clues as to the
likelihood of a summertime slowdown. Many viruses wither under high
temperatures and there is some evidence that the same might be true for
SARS-CoV-2, the novel coronavirus that causes COVID-19.</p>





<p>In an experiment using SARS-CoV-2
in a lab solution, increasing temperature decreased the amount of<a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/S2666-5247(20)30003-3"> viable virus that could be detected</a>, according to an April 2 study in the<em> Lancet Microbe</em>. No infectious virus remained after 30 minutes
at 56° Celsius (133° Fahrenheit). And just five
minutes at 70° C was enough to inactivate the pathogen. </p>



<p>But these
temperature highs are rare, if not impossible, in the lower atmosphere. The National
Academies’ report — aimed at updating the White House on how changing seasons
might affect the pandemic — instead points to other, ongoing studies at
national laboratories that could soon inform how the virus fares under a wider
range of conditions. </p>





<p>Perhaps more
relevant are studies looking for correlations between COVID-19 cases and local
weather. If warmer, wetter places tend to have smaller outbreaks, then much of
the Northern Hemisphere could be in for a break. </p>



<p>One early study
of the outbreak, posted March 30 at medRxiv.org, suggested that for
every 1 degree C increase in atmospheric temperature at relatively high levels of
humidity, daily confirmed cases <a href="https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.30.20044099v1">decreased
by 36 to 57 percent</a> in China’s Hubei Province. That
pattern did not hold across mainland China, though.</p>



<p>Another study, released March 19 and later updated on the preprint repository SSRN, found that 90 percent of global transmission through March 22 occurred when <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3556998">temperatures were between 3° and 17° C</a>. However that study, by a computational neuroscientist and environmental engineer at MIT, did not account for variables such as countries’ testing capacities or policy responses, says Maciej Boni, a Penn State epidemiologist. As a result, Boni doesn’t put much stock in the study’s conclusions.</p>

</h4>
</aside>



<p>“An epidemic is a dynamic process,” so research
into a virus’s transmission ability needs to consider the many possible factors
that might influence the results, Boni says. </p>



<p>The National
Academies’ report notes that “studies published so far have conflicting
results regarding potential seasonal effects, and are hampered by poor data
quality, confounding factors and insufficient time since the beginning of the
pandemic from which to draw conclusions.”</p>



<p>Because humanity has never before
encountered this new coronavirus, the <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/covid-19-when-will-coronavirus-pandemic-social-distancing-end">vast majority of the
population is highly susceptible to infection</a> (<em>SN: 3/24/20</em>). That widespread vulnerability will likely <a href="https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.03.20052787v1">overwhelm any
temperature effect on transmission rates</a>, according to a study that
modeled the effect of varying levels of seasonality on transmission, posted at medRxiv.org
April 7. </p>



<p>That conclusion matches what countries like Australia and Brazil have experienced, with large outbreaks during their summer in the Southern Hemisphere.</p>

<p>Red-billed oxpeckers hitching rides on the backs of black rhinos
are a common sight in the African bush. The <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/do-oxpeckers-help-or-mostly-just-freeload">birds</a> are best known
for feeding from lesions full of ticks or other parasites on a rhino’s hide.
But new research suggests that the relationship between the two species is much
more mutualistic (<em>SN: 10/9/02</em>).
Shouty and shrill oxpeckers can serve as an alarm bell, <a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cub.2020.03.015">alerting black rhinos to the presence of
people</a>, scientists report April 9 in <em>Current Biology.</em> That could help the endangered animals evade
poachers, the researchers propose.</p>



<p>“Rhinos are as blind as bats,” explains Roan Plotz, a behavioral
ecologist at Victoria University in Melbourne, Australia. Even in close
proximity, a rhino might struggle to notice lurking danger by sight. But the
oxpecker easily can, unleashing a sharp call to warn of intruders. </p>



<p>In South Africa’s Hluhluwe–iMfolozi Park, Plotz and his
colleague Wayne Linklater of California State University, Sacramento approached
11 black rhinos (<em>Diceros bicornis</em>) by
foot on the open plain on 86 occasions. The team found that those rhinos with a
red-billed oxpecker (<em>Buphagus
erythrorhynchus</em>) tagging along were much better at detecting the
researchers’ presence than those without. 
</p>



<p>“Rhinos without oxpeckers on their back were able to detect our
approaches just 23 percent of the time whereas rhinos with oxpeckers detected
them every single time,” Plotz says. Rhinos listening to an oxpecker’s heads-up
also picked up on the approaching scientists from 61 meters away, more than
twice as far as when the rhinos were alone. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img alt="Red-billed oxpecker" class="wp-image-3086818" src="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/049720_gd_rhino-oxpecker_inline1.jpg" /><span class="caption wp-caption-3086818">The red-billed oxpecker serves as an alarm bell for black rhinos, signaling nearby danger. The birds often eat pests like ticks from the backs of rhinos and other mammals, including livestock. Due to the practice of applying pesticides to livestock, the oxpecker has seen its numbers decline.</span><span class="credit wp-credit-3086818">Jed Bird</span></figure>



<p>All rhinos responded to the oxpeckers’ alarm calls by becoming
vigilant — standing up from a resting position, for example — and turning to
face downwind, their sensory blind spot. The rhinos then either ran away or
walked downwind to investigate the potential danger.</p>



<p>Black rhinos were once the most numerous species of rhino in the world. But poaching for traditional Chinese medicine has <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/stealing-horn-plenty">devastated the species</a> (<em>SN: 11/17/79</em>). Though poaching has slowed since its peak in 2015, just 5,500 black rhinos remain in the wild and conservationists are searching for solutions that could permanently protect  the <a href="https://www.iucnredlist.org/species/6557/152728945">critically endangered species</a>.   </p>





<p>The red-billed oxpecker has also declined. The birds feed on
ticks, including those burrowed in cattle, but for decades, farmers <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/ece3.2787">treated</a><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/ece3.2787"> their livestock</a> with pesticides to
kill the parasites. This inadvertently transferred the poison to oxpeckers,
causing them to die out in some regions in Africa. In turn, many black rhinos
must navigate the landscape without their avian companions. Given the study’s
findings, Plotz thinks conservationists should consider reintroducing oxpecker
sentinels to rhino populations. </p>





<p>“The oxpeckers are clearly adding a new depth and dimension to
rhino awareness levels,” says animal ecologist Jo Shaw, Africa rhino program
manager at World Wildlife Fund South Africa. “This emphasizes further
the complex webs between species within ecosystems and the need for
conservationists to work to ensure all functions remain intact.” </p>



<p>However, wildlife ecologist Michael Knight, chair of the
International Union for Conservation of Nature’s African Rhino Specialist
Group, cautions that a lot of poaching takes place during full-moon nights when
sleeping oxpeckers would be of less assistance. </p>

                <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/neandertal-made-oldest-known-string">This is the oldest known string. It was made by a Neandertal</a></h4>

<p>In a new twist on Neandertals’ Stone Age accomplishments,
our close evolutionary relatives wound bark fibers into strings that could have
been used to make clothes, rope, nets and other practical but perishable items,
a new study suggests.</p>



<p>A fragment of a <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-61839-w">string</a> made from
three bark fibers was found attached to a stone tool at a French Neandertal
site. That tool was embedded in sediment dating from 52,000 to 41,000 years
ago, say paleoanthropologist Bruce Hardy of Kenyon College in Gambier, Ohio,
and colleagues.</p>



<p>Researchers previously had unearthed stone tools attached to
individual, twisted fibers at the site, France’s Abri du Maras rock-shelter. Those
individual fibers once may have been part of cords, too. But as a piece of an
actual woven string, the new discovery — described April 9 in <em>Scientific Reports</em> — represents
the oldest direct evidence of string making. </p>



<p>Previously, the earliest known cords were made by humans in
western Asia, who <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/stone-age-twining-unraveled">twisted
wild flax fibers</a> into twine as early as around 32,000 years ago (<em>SN: 9/10/09</em>).</p>



<p>The ancient string found at the French Neandertal site may have
been part of a cord that tied the stone tool to a handle, or may have come from
a bag that once contained the tool, the researchers speculate.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img alt="Abri du Maras excavation site" class="wp-image-3086795" src="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/040720_bb_cord_inline1.jpg" /><span class="caption wp-caption-3086795">Excavations at a Neandertal site in France called Abri du Maras (shown) uncovered a stone tool containing remnants of the oldest known string.</span><span class="credit wp-credit-3086795">M.-H. Moncel</span></figure>



<p>Ancient string at Abri du Maras joins <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/neandertals-extensive-seafood-menu-rivals-ancient-humans">recent
evidence suggesting that Neandertals</a> thought and behaved no differently
than Stone Age <em>Homo sapiens</em> did (<em>SN: 3/26/20</em>). Microscopic and molecular
studies of the Abri du Maras string indicate that its fibers come from the
inner bark of a tree such as pine. Neandertal string makers must have known
about trees’ seasonal growth patterns, the researchers say. The best times for
harvesting inner-bark fibers are from early spring to early summer, when fibers
increase in size and thickness due to tree growth.</p>



<p>And the team suggests that a basic understanding of numbers
would have also been needed to count predetermined numbers of fibers used to
make strings, as well as to follow the numerical patterns in strings or cords
needed to construct objects such as bags and nets.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/621138918/0/oupblogpsychology/">Why we like a good robot story</a></h4>

<p>Jim and Kerry Kelly live in a small town in the rural Midwest. Their sons, Ben, six, and Ryan, twelve, attend the local public school. Their school district is always short staffed. The closest town is 40 miles away and the pay for teachers is abysmal.</p><p>This year, the district’s staffing has hit a critical low: Class size will have to be huge, and there’s limited money for aides who might help with the teaching load, which will further discourage teacher applications. The school board considers accepting underqualified teachers. Parents are up in arms. Teachers and principals are stressed. The situation comes to a head at a school board meeting that drags on past midnight with shouting, frustration, threats, and anger. But, it’s too important to back off. Children’s futures are at stake.</p><p>In the next week, the superintendent finds a possible solution. The state has money available to help school boards implement technology in qualified districts. The Kellys’ town qualifies. They can receive funds to buy robots to serve in the classrooms. The robots can assume some of the teaching load, improve teaching quality, and relieve the overcrowding.</p><p>Ten years ago, this would have been unthinkable. Soulless machines educating our children? But, solutions are few, and the superintendent has found reports of success from other schools. He sells his plan well, and against all expectations, the school board agrees. The following fall, the Kelly kids, like all the kids in the district, have a robot in the classroom.</p><p>At the half-year mark, the school board reviews their decision. In six-year-old Ben’s class, the results are outstanding. Kids learn fast—pretty much as fast from the robot as from the human teacher. And, the kids like the interactions with the machines. The teacher can accomplish more and is less stressed in the process. Everyone is pleased.</p><p>But Ryan’s class, at age eleven, has a far different experience. The robot used in their class is identical to the one in Ben’s class—very human-like. By January, the kids hate it. They call it names; they hit it; they learn little from it. By midyear, it sits in a corner, scorned by students and teacher alike.</p><p>This scenario is fiction, but it reflects the real world. Many school districts are hurting for staff, and robots are entering the classroom. In Japan, Robovie speaks and teaches English with elementary school children, like Robosem does in Korea. In the United States, RUBI teaches children Finnish. Child-like robots are helping autistic children practice social interactions through imitation-teaching games.</p><p>Using robots as teachers makes some sense. Children learn much of their knowledge from others: parents, teachers, peers. Children trust that 8 × 8 = 64, that Earth is round, and that dinosaurs are extinct, not because they have uncovered these facts themselves but because reliable sources have told them so. Research shows that children are adapted to learn general knowledge from human communication. The phenomenon is known as “trust in testimony.”</p><p>But, do children trust the testimony of robots? Does it matter if the robot behaves, responds, or even looks like a human? If children learn from a robot, do they learn in the same way they learn from a human teacher? Excellent questions.</p><p>Research shows that when children as young as preschool age learn from other people, they monitor their informants’ knowledge, expertise, and confidence. They remember whether a person has given them accurate information in the past. They also monitor an informant’s access to information: Did she see the thing she is telling me about? They attend to the person’s qualifications: Is he a knowledgeable adult or a naïve child?</p><p>Surprisingly little is known about how and if children learn from robots. Because robots are machines, children could see them as infallible, like calculators or electronic dictionaries. If so, they might accept any information from a robot without considering if it is accurate. Or, children might see robots as a more fallible machine: a toaster that burns the toast, a virtual assistant that can give wrong or even outlandish answers or an alarm clock that goes off in the middle of the night. If so, they might resist a robot’s teachings.</p><p>Young children clearly can and do learn from robots, and they are appropriately choosy about the sort of robot teachers they accept. <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://www.oxfordscholarship.com/view/10.1093/oso/9780190860974.001.0001/oso-9780190860974-chapter-8">Research </a>also shows that young children are more likely to learn from and accept robot teachers that are older children—just like in Ben Kelly’s first grade classroom—and older children are less likely, even unlikely, to do so—like in Ryan Kelly’s sixth grade classroom.</p><p>Isaac Asimov’s book, <em>I, Robot</em>, is primarily about morality and robotics: how robots interact with humans for good or evil. Most of the stories revolve around the efforts of Dr. Susan Calvin, chief roboticist for the fictional U.S. Robotics and Mechanical Men, Incorporated (USRMM), the primary producer of advanced humanoid robots in the world. She worries about aberrant behavior of advanced robots, and she develops a new field, robopsychology, to help figure out what is going on in their electrical (“positronic”) brains.</p><p>All robots produced by USRMM are meant to be programmed with the “Three Laws of Robotics:”</p><ul><li>A robot may not injure a human being or, through inaction, allow a human being to come to harm.</li><li>A robot must obey the orders given it by human beings except where such orders would conflict with the First Law.</li><li>A robot must protect its own existence as long as such protection does not conflict with the First or Second Laws.</li></ul><p>But in Asimov’s stories, flaws are found in the robots and their prototypes. These lead to robots imploding, harming people, and in one key case, killing a man.</p><p><em>I, Robot</em> stories have spawned numerous spin-offs, continuations, and commentaries. A 2004 episode of <em>The Simpsons</em> (titled “I, D’oh Bot”) featured a robot boxer named Smashius Clay. Smashius, self-defeatingly, follows all of Asimov’s three laws and loses to every human he fights.</p><p>The Twentieth Century Fox 2004 film, <em>I, Robot</em>, starred Will Smith as detective Dell Spooner of the 2035 Chicago police department. Dell investigates a murder of the roboticist Dr. Alfred Lanning, which may have been at the hand of a USRMM robot.</p><p>Currently, robots like Robovie (or NAO or RUBI or other robots designed to interact with adults or with children) don’t have moral codes programmed in. But then, they also don’t have anything like full positronic machine intelligence. Conversely, we don’t have laws or codes about how to treat robots. For example, should a really human-like robot have rights? In November 2017, the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://www.wired.co.uk/article/sophia-robot-citizen-womens-rights-detriot-become-human-hanson-robotics">granted a very human-looking robot, Sophia, citizenship</a>. This set off an uproar about rights among women in Saudi Arabia. For example, Saudi women must veil their faces when they are in public; Sophia appeared in public and on TV without a veil.</p><p>Researchers, robot designers, parents, and teachers have become increasingly concerned that interactions with robots will promote antisocial behaviors. A hitchhiking robot who traveled a bit around Europe, taking pictures and carrying on conversations with other travelers, was vandalized and destroyed after several extended weeks in the United States. And, it’s easy to imagine a world where robots displace humans from jobs and so are attacked and sabotaged by those they’ve displaced.</p><p>Research suggests that antisocial behaviors toward robots can be reduced by modifying the robots. Preschool children in a classroom comforted a robot with a hug and protected it from aggression when it started to cry after being damaged or played with too roughly. At least <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2012-04837-001">one study</a> has shown that younger children say a robot should be treated fairly and should not be psychologically harmed after having conversed and played with the robot for fifteen minutes.</p><p>Every year, robots become a larger part of our lives. You can find robots in malls, hotels, assembly lines, hospitals and, of course, research labs. The National Robotics Initiative <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://www.nsf.gov/funding/pgm_summ.jsp?pims_id=503641">foresees a future</a> in which “robots are as commonplace as today’s automobiles, computers, and cell phones. Robots will be found in homes, offices, hospitals, factories, farms, and mines; and in the air, on land, under water, and in space.”</p><p>And robots are becoming more and more present in the lives of children. They are already teaching children in classrooms and helping them in hospitals. Robovie is just one of many robots that have been manufactured in the last few years designed to be used with children–created to play games, answer questions, read stories, and even watch children unsupervised.</p><p>This unbridled production of hopefully child-friendly robots certainly needs more research. But, it’s clear that in some ways and at some ages children can successfully learn from robot teachers who actively interact with them.</p><p><em>Featured Image by Andy Kelly from </em><a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://unsplash.com/photos/0E_vhMVqL9g"><em>Unsplash</em></a></p><p>The post <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://blog.oup.com/2020/04/why-we-like-a-good-robot-story-2/">Why we like a good robot story</a> appeared first on <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://blog.oup.com">OUPblog</a>.</p><img align="left" border="0" height="1" hspace="0" src="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/i/621138918/0/oupblogpsychology" style="border: 0; float: left; margin: 0; padding: 0; width: 1px!important; height: 1px!important;" width="1" /><div style="clear: both; padding-top: 0.2em;"><a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/2/621138918/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/fbshare20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/28/621138918/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/fblike20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/30/621138918/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/googleplus20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/16/621138918/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/linkedin20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/29/621138918/oupblogpsychology,"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/pinterest20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/1/621138918/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/reddit20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/24/621138918/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/twitter20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/19/621138918/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/email20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/20/621138918/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/rss20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a><h3 style="clear: left; padding-top: 10px;">Related Stories</h3><ul><li><a href="https://blog.oup.com/2020/04/the-surprising-scientific-value-of-national-bias/" rel="nofollow">The surprising scientific value of national bias</a></li><li><a href="https://blog.oup.com/2020/03/how-to-rate-and-rank-potential-doctoral-students/" rel="nofollow">How to rate and rank potential doctoral students</a></li><li><a href="https://blog.oup.com/2020/03/how-olive-oil-promotes-brain-health/" rel="nofollow">How olive oil promotes brain health</a></li></ul> </div>

<p>For about
a week in 1960, radio astronomer Frank Drake thought he might have discovered
aliens. </p>



<p>He had
pointed the National Radio Astronomy Observatory’s new 26-meter telescope at
the star Epsilon Eridani on April 8 of that year, and within minutes, the
instruments went wild. The telescope’s readout device, a chart recorder that
used a pen to scratch out signatures of incoming signals on paper, scribbled
erratically. A speaker connected to the telescope blared a train of strong pulses
— just the kind of transmission expected from an intelligent sender. Drake was
stunned. Could finding E.T. really be this easy?</p>



<p>It
wasn’t. When the telescope found the signal again several days later, a radio
antenna pointed in different direction also picked up the noise. The signal
wasn’t otherworldly at all; it was coming from an earthly source, like an
airplane.</p>



<p>Drake
never picked up any interstellar broadcasts during his <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/listen-other-suns">two months observing</a> Epsilon Eridani and another
sunlike star, Tau Ceti, with the radio telescope in West Virginia (<em>SN:
4/30/60</em>). But that first foray into the search for extraterrestrial
intelligence, or SETI, sparked a growing field of efforts to scout out fellow
intelligent creatures among the stars. And now, with recent discoveries in
astronomy, new technologies and a flush of new money, SETI is in renaissance. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img alt="National Radio Astronomy Observatory in 1960" class="wp-image-3086776" src="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/040720_mt_seti_inline1.jpg" /><span class="caption wp-caption-3086776">In April 1960, radio astronomer Frank Drake used a 26-meter telescope at the National Radio Astronomy Observatory in West Virginia (pictured) to observe two nearby, sunlike stars for alien radio broadcasts. The observing campaign, which he dubbed Project Ozma, was the world’s first modern search for extraterrestrial intelligence.</span><span class="credit wp-credit-3086776">NSF, AUI, NRAO</span></figure>



<p>“It’s
really difficult to overstate how much the field has been transformed” in the
last few years, says Andrew Siemion, director of the University of California,
Berkeley’s SETI Research Center. </p>



<p>Bigger and better telescopes are probing deeper into the night sky. Sophisticated computational tools are poring over massive datasets on increasing numbers of stars and at a wider variety of frequencies. Observatories around the world are performing regular observations as part of Breakthrough Listen — a $100 million effort funded by Israeli-Russian billionaires Yuri and Julia Milner to conduct the <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/search-et-gets-financial-boost">most comprehensive search for extraterrestrials yet</a> (<em>SN: 7/20/15</em>).</p>





<p>So far, SETI
scientists have found nothing but radio silence. Still, they are undeterred. They’ve
scoured <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/only-small-fraction-space-searched-aliens">only a tiny fraction</a> of the places E.T. could be (<em>SN:
9/30/18</em>). And SETI’s collective observing power will make scientists 1,000
times more likely to find E.T. during this decade than they were in the 2010s, Siemion
says.</p>



<p>This is,
he says, “a boom time for SETI.” </p>





<h4>Eyes on the sky</h4>



<p>For
decades, the hunt for intelligent aliens languished <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/astronomers-say-time-start-taking-search-aliens-seriously">on the fringes</a> of the scientific establishment (<em>SN:
1/28/19</em>), viewed by many researchers as a “strange, boutiquey sort of thing
that’s not really astronomy,” says Siemion, principal investigator for
Breakthrough Listen. Short-lived U.S. federal funding for the field abruptly
ended in 1993, after which “SETI went underground and became very insular.”</p>



<p>But
SETI’s profile is changing, as our understanding of the universe evolves. Back when
Drake was making his observations, we hadn’t yet laid eyes on a planet around
another star. Within just the last decade, we’ve discovered <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/why-just-being-habitable-zone-doesnt-make-exoplanets-livable">thousands of exoplanets</a>, giving new credence to arguments
that life beyond Earth is entirely possible (<em>SN: 10/4/19</em>).</p>



<p>In February,
Breakthrough Listen released the largest ever stockpile of SETI observations
for members of the astronomical community to analyze. The dataset, collected by
the Parkes radio telescope in Australia, the Green Bank Telescope in West
Virginia and the Automated Planet Finder in California, included a survey of radio
emissions from the disk of the Milky Way and the region around its core

<p>“For finding very advanced civilizations, I think the galactic center is very exciting,” Siemion says. There, he speculates that some super tech-savvy aliens could have built an extremely powerful radio transmitter charged by the Milky Way’s supermassive black hole. </p>



<p>To find alien
civilizations working with more modest radio equipment comparable to our own,
searchers look to nearby stars. That was the approach that Sofia Sheikh, an
astronomer at Penn State, took in analyzing Breakthrough Listen observations of
20 of the sun’s stellar neighbors. All of those stars are in positions relative
to Earth that would allow any aliens around those stars to see Earth orbiting in
front of the sun — the same way that <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/less-year-after-launch-tess-already-finding-bizarre-worlds">telescopes like TESS spot
exoplanets</a> (<em>SN:
1/8/19</em>). Those aliens might therefore be able detect Earth’s presence and target
our planet with a message.</p>



<p>Sheikh
and colleagues <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2002.06162">came up empty</a> in their search. “Reporting null
results isn’t fun,” she says of her analysis, which was posted at arXiv.org on
February 14 and submitted to the <em>Astrophysical Journal</em>. But it does tell
other astronomers “this particular space has already been searched, go search
somewhere else,” she says. Given the vast cosmic real estate where E.T. might
be, checking out every little stellar neighborhood helps.</p>



<p>New
observatories joining the Breakthrough Listen cohort will start looking in a
lot of other places in the next few years. The MeerKAT array in South Africa is
gearing up to survey 1 million nearby stars. The Very Large Array in New
Mexico, seen in the 1997 film <em>Contact</em>, is getting its first SETI
instrument and will start looking for aliens in the background of its
observations for other astronomy studies in 2021.</p>



<h4>Building better filters</h4>



<p>Getting
more eyes on the sky is a key part of SETI. But while telescopes are heaping up
a massive haystack of data, there’s still the task of searching for any needles
buried within. And it could take picking through the same data more than once. New
computer algorithms can always revisit old observations to search for blips
that previous analyses missed. </p>



<p>Often in
radio astronomy, “the most interesting discoveries are not made on the first or
the second or even the third analysis of the dataset,” Siemion says. For
example, brief, brilliant flashes of radio waves from distant galaxies called fast
radio bursts were first <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/searching-distant-signals">discovered in a reexamination of
old data from the Parkes telescope</a>
(<em>SN: 7/25/14</em>).</p>



<p>In SETI,
the perennial challenge is devising techniques to better distinguish potential alien
signals from radio interference by earthly technology. SETI scientists are
usually seeking the same kind of tight, well-defined radio transmissions that
human electronics produce. Such signals are easily distinguishable from radio
waves emanating from natural sources, such as stars or galaxies, which tend to
vary slowly over time or be smeared out across many frequencies. But that means
scientists have to judge whether any promising signals they detect are coming
from deep space or from a nearby a cell phone or satellite. </p>





<p>One way
of doing this is to point a telescope at a target, like a star, then somewhere
else. Any radio signals that appear when the telescope is pointed in both
directions are probably humanmade radio interference. Conventional computer
algorithms detect changes between on-star and off-star observations simply by
comparing the amount of energy detected in each observation. But if a faint
alien transmission overlaps in the sky with earthly noise, a basic
energy-detection algorithm may mistakenly discount everything it sees as
humanmade noise. </p>



<p>Some
researchers hope artificial intelligence will be better than rigid energy-detection
algorithms at detecting subtle changes between on- and off-star observations.
While at the Berkeley SETI Research Center, applied machine learning researcher
Yunfan Gerry Zhang taught an AI to recognize radio interference from human
technology by showing it thousands of observations from the Green Bank
Telescope. Using its learned sense of what earthly radio interference looked
like, the <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/8646437">AI could accurately pick out humanmade
noise</a> that was
mixed into on-star observations. </p>



<p>If such
an algorithm were to detect radio signals from a star that didn’t qualify as
humanmade noise, the AI could flag that star for researchers as a potential
source of alien transmissions. Zhang’s team presented the AI at the 2018 IEEE Global Conference
on Signal and Information Processing as a tool for finding oddities in future
SETI investigations. </p>



<h4>Looking for lasers</h4>



<p>Radio waves,
the focus of mainstream SETI, are not the only means of sending interstellar
messages. Aliens could also encode information in nanosecond laser pulses. Though
lasers were first suggested as potential interstellar beacons in 1961, most
SETI searches have followed Drake in looking for radio communications — partly
because radio waves are low energy, and so possibly a more
cost-effective way to package
interstellar mail.</p>



<p>But
optical light could also be a practical interstellar beacon if focused into a narrow
laser beam, argue proponents of this approach, called optical SETI or OSETI. Fast
laser flashes would be would be detected as a bunch of photons hitting the
telescope all at once, as opposed to the steady trickle of incoming photons
from background starlight. As a result, for the nanosecond duration of the
laser pulse, it could outshine surrounding stars. And no known astrophysical
sources produce nanosecond optical blips.</p>



<p>“Optical
SETI is still in its infancy, or early toddler phase,” compared with radio
SETI, says Shelley Wright, an astrophysicist at the University of California,
San Diego. But if used in tandem with radio scans of the sky, OSETI efforts can
expand the search into entirely different mode of communication.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="alignright size-full"><img alt="PANOSETI observatories field view" class="wp-image-3086781" src="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/040820_mt_seti_inline3.gif" /><span class="caption wp-caption-3086781">To take the search for alien laser signals to the next level, researchers have proposed building four dedicated PANOSETI observatories — two in the Northern Hemisphere, two in the south. The observatories’ collective field of view (projected onto the sky in this animation) would cover the entire observable night sky to keep a continual lookout for interstellar laser beacons.</span><span class="credit wp-credit-3086781">PANOSETI team</span></figure></div>



<p>In July
2019, the VERITAS telescope array at the Whipple Observatory in Arizona joined
Breakthrough Listen. This telescope quartet was built to watch for brief
flashes of blue “Cherenkov” light generated by astrophysical gamma rays hitting
Earth’s atmosphere. But its fast cameras are also well suited to looking for
E.T.’s laser beams. </p>



<p>The
VERITAS Breakthrough Listen effort involves both new optical stellar
observations and a review of old VERITAS data. Already, some of those analyses
have garnered results, even if somewhat disappointing. Nine hours of observations
taken from 2009 to 2015 of <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/aliens-ruled-out-why-tabbys-star-flickers">Tabby’s Star</a> — once suspected of holding an
alien megastructure in its orbit due to its bizarre periodic dimming (<em>SN:
1/3/18</em>) — <a href="https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/2041-8205/818/2/L33">found no alien laser beacons</a>, the researchers reported in the <em>Astrophysical
Journal Letters</em> in 2016. </p>



<p>Wright
and colleagues hope to dramatically expand OSETI with new facilities. While previous
OSETI searches, including VERITAS, have targeted specific stars for only
minutes at a time, Wright’s team has drawn up a blueprint for four dedicated
SETI observatories to keep constant vigil for alien laser pulses across the
entire observable sky. </p>



<p>This <a href="https://www.spiedigitallibrary.org/conference-proceedings-of-spie/10702/107025I/Panoramic-optical-and-near-infrared-SETI-instrument--overall-specifications/10.1117/12.2314268.short?SSO=1">observatory concept, dubbed
PANOSETI</a>, was
described at the SPIE Astronomical Telescopes + Instrumentation meeting in
Austin, Texas, in July 2018. Each observatory would be a dome covered in 88
lenses with optical and near-infrared detectors. One pair of observatories in
the Northern Hemisphere would keep watch over the northern sky, while a second
pair in the south would keep tabs on the southern sky. </p>



<p>Two observatories in two different locations would have to keep watch over the same part of the sky to ensure that anything a single observatory detected wasn’t a glitch or an effect caused by local light pollution, Wright says — the same way a pair of far-flung LIGO detectors teamed up to detect <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/gravity-waves-black-holes-verify-einsteins-prediction">cosmic ripples called gravitational waves</a> (<em>SN: 2/11/16</em>). “Nobody would have believed LIGO without a secondary site,” she says. Double-checking potential detections would be absolutely crucial for a claim as extraordinary as receiving a greeting from E.T.</p>

                <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/~r/plos/Blog/~3/JYqJBgwZHgw/">Learning how we can support researchers during COVID-19</a></h4>

<p> </p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We know that your daily routines have probably changed due to COVID-19. Whether you’re keeping more distance between yourself and others, working from home more often, or feeling isolated by larger-scale shutdowns, it may take awhile for things to go back to normal.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">During this time of uncertainty, we want you to know: we are here to support you.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Without knowing at this point what the long-term impact will be of interrupted research projects, conferences, and teaching schedules, we’re trying to find out more about you and your unique situation so that we can provide you with the information you most want. Last week, we launched a survey for researchers to let us know how their work has changed in recent weeks and we wanted to share some of the preliminary results with you as we dig in deeper.</span></p>
<p> </p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">First, a couple of caveats.</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This survey data comes from an informal marketing poll surfaced through email and on our site beginning on March 27. The survey links are still available and we’re collecting new responses every day but the summary below is based off of responses received between March 27 and April 3 only.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We also posted a simplified version on our Twitter account to take the pulse from a broader community. Those data are not included in this summary but we saw very similar trends.</span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>Survey Structure</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While the initial question was the same for each researcher who entered the survey, the second-tier question was tailored to their response from Question 1. Partial responses (results where researchers answered the first question only) are included in the breakdown below.</span></p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p><a href="http://blogs.plos.org/plos/files/2020/04/Survey-Chart-3.png"><img alt="" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-42953" height="436" src="http://blogs.plos.org/plos/files/2020/04/Survey-Chart-3-1024x436.png" width="1024" /></a></p>
<h2></h2>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">What’s the scale of the impact?</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Most researchers said their work was interrupted  in some way, either by restricted access to their labs, or a need to take personal time off. Only 7.2% of respondents reported that their lab was open and operating normally. Another 4.3% reported that their work is directly relevant to the outbreak and are actively investigating. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Of those few whose labs were operating normally, 33.3% were “very” concerned that they would see steeper closures in the next few days.</span></p>
<figure class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_42952" style="width: 600px;"><a href="http://blogs.plos.org/plos/files/2020/04/chart.png"><img alt="" class="wp-image-42952 size-full" height="371" src="http://blogs.plos.org/plos/files/2020/04/chart.png" width="600" /></a>Response breakdown to Question #1. Total Responses: 54, 749</figure>
<p> </p>
<p><b>In what ways are researchers able to continue their work?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For those whose labs or institutions have been closed, many researchers have found a way to continue their work remotely (36.2%). Of those, 58.6% reported that their research, or elements of it, could be done without a lab, although 34.8% said they had to shift to something like protocol design or new analysis that would not require a lab. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For the researchers who’ve had to change their focus (26%) or cancel fieldwork entirely (18%), writing and training have become the major focus.</span></p>
<figure class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_42954" style="width: 600px;"><a href="http://blogs.plos.org/plos/files/2020/04/chart-1.png"><img alt="" class="wp-image-42954 size-full" height="371" src="http://blogs.plos.org/plos/files/2020/04/chart-1.png" width="600" /></a>Response breakdown for Question 2 for those who said they needed to cancel or shift the focus of their existing work</figure>
<p> </p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">As researchers’ needs change, so should the way we support them</span></h2>
<p> </p>
<p><b>Serving authors on the front lines</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For those respondents who have told us they are actively investigating research related to the coronavirus, speed matters more than anything else. At PLOS, we are fast-tracking all research related to COVID-19, the first studies of which we have already published and made available in our </span><a href="https://collections.plos.org/covid-19"><span style="font-weight: 400;">COVID-19 collection</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> which surfaces research from across all PLOS Journals along with other relevant content. </span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>Redefining priorities for career advancement</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A number of organizations have come together to support researchers during this time. For example,  the Declaration on Research Assessment (DORA) released a </span><a href="https://sfdora.org/2020/04/06/dora-statement-on-hiring-promotion-and-funding-decisions-during-the-covid-19-pandemic/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">statement </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> earlier this week,calling on research institutions and universities to evaluate their hiring, promotion, and funding decisions within the context of the broad-scale interruptions researchers are facing in their daily work. The statement specifically asks institutions to:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Redefine their expectations for productivity in the wake of the present pandemic.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Communicate clearly to academics and researchers how they will modify research evaluation procedures for hiring, promotion, and tenure.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">PLOS fully supports this appeal and urges all institutions and funders to join those who have already </span><a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1U5REApf-t-76UXh8TKAGoLlwy8WIMfSSyqCJbb5u9lA/edit#gid=0"><span style="font-weight: 400;">taken action</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and consider similar policies to let researchers know that their careers will not grind to a halt due to the impact of the pandemic. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If COVID-19 has impacted your ability to continue reviewing, editing, or revising manuscripts in process at PLOS, </span><a href="https://blogs.plos.org/plos/2020/03/a-message-to-our-community-regarding-covid-19/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">we encourage</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> you to reach out to the journal for an extension so that you can take the time you need to focus on other concerns.  </span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If there is another way we can help support the communication and discovery of research as your publishing needs change, please consider sharing your thoughts by emailing us at </span><a href="mailto:community@pos.org"><span style="font-weight: 400;">community@plos.org</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> or by responding to </span><a href="https://surveys.plos.org/s3/covid-survey"><span style="font-weight: 400;">the survey</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> itself. </span></p>

<p><em>By </em><a href="http://emilyoliviareynolds.com/">Emily Reynolds</a></p>
<p>Knowing what to say when a friend is upset or stressed out can be a delicate balancing act. Sometimes the best route seems to be to offer advice and give practical suggestions as to how they should proceed; at other times, simply listening to what your friend has to say is by far the better option. But no matter your approach, ensuring that your friend feels validated is key, argue Xi Tian and colleagues in a <a href="https://academic.oup.com/joc/article-abstract/70/1/13/5739595?redirectedFrom=fulltext">new study</a> published in the <em>Journal of Communication</em>.</p>
<p><span id="more-39448"></span>The study starts with a question many of us have pondered ourselves: why do some well-intentioned attempts at comfort come off as insensitive instead?</p>
<p>To explore the question, the team asked 325 married adults to think of one person with whom they’d discussed their partner or marriage, and to imagine having a conversation with them about a recent argument they’d had with their spouse. They were then presented with one of six support messages, each of which was more or less person-centred — in other words, more or less willing to acknowledge and elaborate on the feelings of the upset person. Low person-centred messages focused on simply moving past the argument (e.g. “nobody is worth getting so worked up about… having an argument is not the worst thing that could happen to you”), whilst high person-centred messages were more engaged and acknowledged the individuals’ feelings (e.g. “you have every right to feel upset… it’s understandable you are stressed out”).</p>
<p>Participants then rated the support messages on a number of measures, including how controlling and dominant, direct and clear, or logical and well-justified the messages were. They also reported whether they felt pressured by their friend, and indicated the extent to which they experienced psychological “reactance”: that is, how angry they were after reading the message, and how critical they felt of it. Finally, they rated how optimistic they would feel after receiving the message and how much their emotions would improve.</p>
<p>As expected, low person-centred messages were not successful in helping people feel better about disputes with their partner, nor did they reduce emotional distress. These types of messages angered participants, and were also seen as domineering and lacked argument strength — in other words, they were neither convincing nor comforting.</p>
<p>In contrast, high person-centred messages were associated with higher levels of emotional improvement, which the team puts down partly to the fact participants felt little or no threat to their freedom when responding to these messages (i.e. they didn’t feel pressured or controlled by their friend). There was also less emotional reactance to high person-centred messages — participants felt less angry, less critical and less likely to argue with their friend.</p>
<p>There are some limitations to the study: the messages participants received were, of course, fake, so the way they would feel about them in the context of a real conversation with a friend may differ from the artificial environment of the study. Future studies may also take into consideration the diversity of relationships and their social contexts — as the team notes, the majority of participants were in heterosexual relationships, in their first marriages and white.</p>
<p>There will, of course, be times when you believe a friend really is overreacting — that they’re making a big deal over nothing. At times like these, the results of this study may be useful to keep in mind. If you want to make them feel comforted, acknowledging, not dismissing, what they’re feeling is the way to go.</p>

<p><a href="https://amzn.to/2QWzl8q">Alien Oceans</a><br /><em>Kevin Peter Hand</em><br /><em>Princeton Univ., $27.95</em></p>



<p>Life as we know it requires liquid water. That’s why astronomers get excited when a planet is found in a star’s “habitable zone,” the Goldilocks region in which a planet is neither too close nor too far from its star to have liquid surface water.</p>



<p>In <em>Alien Oceans</em>, NASA scientist Kevin Peter Hand argues that the notion of the habitable zone should be expanded. At least six moons in the outer solar system are likely to have oceans of water beneath icy facades. For these orbs, the sun isn’t the heat source that keeps oceans liquid. Instead, the decay of radioactive elements inside a moon’s rocky core might keep things warm. Another possibility is tidal flexing: If a moon follows an elongated orbit around a planet, ever-changing tides would create friction within the core and release heat. Similar conditions could allow for ice-covered oceans on planetary bodies in other solar systems too.</p>





<p>Chapter by chapter, Hand lays out the evidence for the existence of distant oceans in our solar system. Take Europa, Jupiter’s fourth-largest moon. As far back as the early 1970s, spectroscopic images from an Earth-based telescope hinted at the presence of water ice. During the late 1990s and early 2000s, repeated flybys of Europa by the Galileo spacecraft helped reveal how the moon’s mass is distributed in layers; some layers are denser than others, hinting at the presence of water. Data from Galileo’s magnetometer, which detected changing magnetic fields caused by the flow of charged particles, bolstered the idea that the moon hosts a salty ocean.</p>



<p>Similar observations point to subsurface oceans on two other moons of Jupiter, Callisto and Ganymede; Enceladus and Titan, which circle Saturn; and Neptune’s moon Triton. </p>



<p>Liquid water alone is not enough to make these moons habitable. Hand discusses other conditions needed for life, including chemical substances that would have to be present for organisms to build bodies and have metabolisms. He also describes plans to further explore these places. Missions could include landers that carry robotic <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/ice-distant-moon">probes that would melt or drill their way through ice</a> and then release a mini-sub to explore the hidden ocean (<em>SN: 5/17/14, p. 20</em>). </p>



<p><em>Alien Oceans</em> offers a historical look — as well as a peek into the future — at one of the most exciting aspects of space exploration. With the technology at hand, we could determine whether there’s life beyond Earth.</p>

<p>Allison Fong dangles over the edge of a “river” running
through a massive chunk of sea ice floating between the North Pole and Russia’s
Komsomolets Island. The river cracked open in the ice just a few days ago,
exposing the Arctic Ocean below. Already starting to freeze over, the river’s
surface is a dark scar in the white landscape.</p>



<p>The crack could open further,
destabilizing or even cleaving the 3-kilometer-wide floe. To avoid falling into
the hypothermia-inducing waters (which hover at –1.8° Celsius), Fong
distributes her weight on her hands and knees and is tethered to a stronger
piece of ice a few meters away. </p>



<p>She looks at ease as she pulls a chunk of recently frozen ice from the crack and squeezes it slightly. It seems solid, but it compresses like a cube of Jell-O, which means the chunk hasn’t completely frozen and still contains small chambers of liquid water. Those chambers are home to microscopic organisms that will remain trapped in the ice throughout winter — enduring pitch-black days and frigid temperatures from October until March, when the sun finally returns. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img alt="Allison Fong and Robert Rember taking samples" class="wp-image-3086605" src="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/041120_sh_arctic_inline1_680.jpg" /><span class="caption wp-caption-3086605">Alfred Wegener Institute biologist Allison Fong (left) and chemical oceanographer Robert Rember of the University of Alaska Fairbanks sample water and ice — to study the organisms within — from a crack on the ice floe on October 10. </span><span class="credit wp-credit-3086605">Esther Horvath</span></figure>



<p>And yet those organisms manage to
thrive. Fong, a biologist with the Alfred Wegener Institute in Bremerhaven,
Germany, wants to know how. </p>



<p>Even phytoplankton, a type of algae
that relies on sunlight to fuel photosynthesis, are far from dormant in the
dark. Scientists suspect that these microscopic creatures rely on stored
deposits of fats or feed on small particles in the winter waters. </p>





<p>Finding out for sure is important
given that these algae form the foundation of the Arctic food web. Their
massive springtime blooms provide a buffet for other critters, particularly
zooplankton, tiny sea animals that are munched on by larger squid and fish,
which are dinner for the seals that are eaten by whales and polar bears. </p>



<p>Any change to the algae will surely rock the food web — and change is brewing. Rising temperatures in the Arctic have <a href="https://www.arctic.noaa.gov/Report-Card/Report-Card-2018/ArtMID/7878/ArticleID/772/Executive-Summary">caused the ice to melt and thin</a>. As a result, algal blooms are growing earlier in the season and farther north. Blooms have even been seen under the ice itself. To better predict these changes and how they might affect the food web, scientists first have to grasp how algae and other microscopic organisms survive polar night and how they respond to the lowest levels of light.</p>

<p>Algae, such as phytoplankton, form the foundation of the Arctic food web, passing nutrients from the smallest creatures to the largest.</p>

<p>Much about the Arctic remains a
mystery. There are more than 1,000 species of microalgae in the frigid waters,
and none have been studied close to the North Pole. “There’s literally no data
about animals and their activities during polar night from the central Arctic,”
Fong says. </p>



<p>That’s because every winter, the
central Arctic becomes a fortress of sea ice too thick for ships to penetrate.
Most research vessels flee south. But in early October, the German icebreaker <em>Polarstern</em>
ventured north and steered into a massive ice floe at 85° N latitude. There,
the captain killed the ship’s engines, so the vessel could freeze in place. </p>



<p>The mission, known as <a href="https://mosaic-expedition.org/">MOSAiC</a>, for Multidisciplinary drifting Observatory for the Study of Arctic Climate, is now traveling across the Arctic like a barnacle on that massive ice floe for one year. Fong and scientists from 20 countries have the unprecedented opportunity to gather data in the central Arctic during polar night to learn how climate change is affecting the vast landscape and its inhabitants — from the tiniest algae to the 900-pound polar bears.</p>





<h4>A frozen metropolis</h4>



<p>In mid-September, a team of MOSAiC scientists — plus a
few lucky journalists including myself — set sail from Tromsø, Norway, and
headed east along Russia’s coast before veering toward the North Pole. As we
edged north, the days grew shorter. Soon, the sun would disappear altogether,
as did any signs of other ships and birds. In every direction, the light gray
sky collided with dark blue waves — and nothing else. The world seemed empty of
life. </p>



<div class="wp-block-sciencenews-content-sidebar">
<h3>Frozen vessel</h3>



<p>The <em>Polarstern</em> headed northeast from Tromsø, Norway, toward the North Pole. The ship has been floating (dotted line) as part of a large ice floe on an expedition that will end in October.</p>



<div class="image-desktop"><figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img alt="Polarstern route map" class="wp-image-3086733" src="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/041120_sh_arctic_inline5_desktop_680_REV-1.png" /><span class="credit wp-credit-3086733">C.

Chang</span></figure></div>
</div>



<p>Then one night after the sun had set,
I stood at the ship’s stern watching the waves in our path when I saw what
looked like a shooting star in the water. The light disappeared as quickly as
it had appeared. Then another flashed. And another. For several nights, the
lights danced and sparkled as bioluminescent organisms (probably a type of
marine plankton) produced light within the wake. </p>



<p>For me, it was the first hint that the
seemingly dead landscape was thriving with microbial life. But it wasn’t the
last. When we entered the edge of the Arctic ice cap — a mosaic of ice floes
that jostle at the top of the world — I would often watch as the icebreaker
crashed through sheets of white ice. Large, overturned chunks would rock the
ship — often with such power that it felt as though we had run aground — and
then scrape against the steel hull with a whine like nails across a chalkboard.
Those chunks occasionally revealed hidden layers of turquoise ice. And every so
often, the ice would be yellowish brown — a sign of ice algae. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img alt="Bioluminescent organisms" class="wp-image-3086608" src="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/041120_sh_arctic_inline3_680.jpg" /><span class="caption wp-caption-3086608">Bioluminescent organisms sparkle in the water as scientists lean over the edge of the <em>Akademik Fedorov</em> — an icebreaker that accompanied the <em>Polarstern</em> at the start of the MOSAiC mission.</span><span class="credit wp-credit-3086608">Mario Hoppmann/Alfred Wegener Inst.</span></figure>



<p>The sight of that “dirty ice” sent the
scientists into a state of euphoria, eager to take a closer look at the very
organisms they were there to study. Luckily, the group didn’t have to wait
long. On October 4, we crashed into the ice floe that would serve as MOSAiC’s
home for the next year, and scientists immediately spread out onto the ice. In
a race to set up research stations before the sun set over our latitude one
last time until March, teams leveled roads, set up power lines and moved
instruments onto the ice. </p>



<p>The work was often waylaid by the
challenging environment — and a furry visitor or two. Six days after the
scientists began their work, a curious polar bear and her cub ambled into the
camp, knocking down power lines and munching on instruments. With each
subsequent visit, the ship’s horn and a radio announcement sent scientists back
to the ship, halting all work on the ice. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img alt="Polar bear" class="wp-image-3086609" src="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/041120_sh_arctic_inline4_680.jpg" /><span class="caption wp-caption-3086609">A polar bear and her cub were frequent visitors to the expedition site.</span><span class="credit wp-credit-3086609">S. Hall</span></figure>



<p>But the furry visitors weren’t the
only obstacle. Ships that were sent to the ice floe every few months were often
delayed by weather, and air missions were grounded in March to keep the
coronavirus off the ship. </p>



<p>The ice didn’t always cooperate
either. A few days after we reached our new home, a storm rocked the floe, opening
several cracks beyond the ship’s bow. Until then, the floe had felt so stable —
even continent-like — that it was easy to forget that it was just a thin veneer
of ice that could be tossed about by the wind. Unfortunately for Fong, the
location beyond the ship’s bow, the spot she had been eyeing for her research
station, became unattainable. </p>



<p>Unlike other scientists who set up camp within a few hundred meters of the ship, Fong needed to work <a href="https://advances.sciencemag.org/content/4/1/eaap9887.full">far from the ship’s bright lights</a> to study how the Arctic’s natural light (or lack thereof) affects the tiniest critters. Once the storm dashed her initial plan, it took a few weeks for her to find a new location, more than a kilometer from the ship’s starboard side. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img alt="Polarstern" class="wp-image-3086612" src="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/041120_sh_arctic_inline6_680.jpg" /><span class="caption wp-caption-3086612">The <em>Polarstern</em> as seen from a helicopter during a flight to survey damage after a storm in mid-October.</span><span class="credit wp-credit-3086612">S. Hall</span></figure>



<p>Shortly after I departed the
expedition aboard a second icebreaker, Fong’s team — 10 scientists and two
polar bear guards — piled into four snowmobiles and six wood sleds once a week.
The group cruised along a bumpy road, past small mountains of snow and ice
dubbed “the fortress,” to the other edge of the ice floe. There, in the dark,
the team collected cores of ice for analysis in a dark and cold lab back on the
ship. “That will give us a sense of who’s there,” Fong says, and how active
those organisms might be — in the absence of light. </p>



<div class="wp-block-sciencenews-content-sidebar">
<h3>A mosaic of research</h3>



<p>Outside the <em>Polarstern</em> icebreaker meteorologists and climate researchers, marine biologists and specialists in snow, sea ice and other disciplines set up <a href="https://mosaic-expedition.org/expedition/ice-camp/">research stations</a>, such as ROV city, where remotely operated vehicles dive under the ice to take measurements in the Arctic Ocean, and MET city, where sensors and tethered balloons measure atmospheric changes. </p>

<h4>Dark secrets </h4>



<p>In 2007, Jørgen Berge, a marine biologist at the Arctic University of Norway in Tromsø, was analyzing data from an instrument that had been moored to the seafloor in the low Arctic, when he noticed that <a href="https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rsbl.2008.0484">masses of zooplankton had been migrating</a> up and down the water column in winter. That behavior is typical during much of the year when daylight is in play. The creatures rise to the surface at night to feed on phytoplankton and dive back down during the day. Seeing such activity in the dark of Arctic winter, Berge thought he’d found an error in the data. But later research suggested that the zooplankton’s movement <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/moon-animals-light-behavior-lunar-phases">was driven by the moon’s faint light</a> (<em>SN: 7/6/19 &amp; 7/20/19, p. 32</em>). </p>



<p>Just because we perceive the Arctic as
pitch-black during winter, other species might not. “No matter where you look,
whether it’s in the marine environment or the terrestrial environment,
organisms have different ways of experiencing the world and sensing the world,”
says marine biologist Jonathan Cohen of the University of Delaware in Lewes. </p>



<p>On two Arctic cruises in 2014 and
2015, Cohen and colleagues measured what little light was available during
polar night. The levels, they found, were 100 million times lower than those
observed during Arctic summer. But even during the perpetual night of the
Arctic winter, there is still a difference between day and night. Sunlight
reflected from below the horizon actually makes the day a little brighter than
the night. Plus, the moon and possibly the northern lights add a measurable
glare. Still, Cohen wasn’t sure if that minimal light was enough for Arctic
animals to use. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img alt="Stefanie Arndt" class="wp-image-3086613" src="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/041120_sh_arctic_inline7_1030.jpg" /><span class="caption wp-caption-3086613">Stefanie Arndt, an Alfred Wegener physicist, takes a selfie on the ice floe in early March at twilight.</span><span class="credit wp-credit-3086613">S. Arndt/Alfred Wegener Inst.</span></figure>



<p>So his team hooked electrodes up to zooplankton to measure how the creatures responded to flashes of faint light. The animals <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0126247%20">reacted most strongly to the bluish colors</a> that penetrated deep into the water column, which explains how zooplankton migrate throughout polar winter. </p>



<p>And those swimmers aren’t alone.
Scientists have begun to realize that the Arctic — even during polar night — is
astonishingly alive. Seabirds, which are thought to be visual predators, forage
in the middle of winter. So do multiple species of fish and krill. Clams grow
at similar rates in the winter as they do during the summer. And all kinds of
organisms, including snails on the seafloor, reproduce despite the cold and
darkness. </p>



<p>Even phytoplankton stay active. Although scientists can’t yet say exactly how, they suspect that <a href="https://www.readcube.com/articles/10.1007/s00300-016-2067-y">some species live on stored deposits of fats</a>, and others might <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24553471">undergo a dramatic metamorphosis every winter</a>. </p>



<p><em>Micromonas pusilla</em>, one of the most abundant species of
phytoplankton, actually switches to a more animal-like lifestyle, feeding on
bacteria and other small particles in the water column. Yet the phytoplankton
manage to keep their photosynthetic apparatus intact throughout the dark polar
night, which enables them to respond within hours to the return of sunlight in
the spring. </p>



<p>“There’s a whole world that thrives
during the darkness,” says Eva Leu, a marine biologist with Akvaplan-niva in
Tromsø, a daughter company of the Norwegian Institute for Water Research. Leu
helped plan biology experiments for MOSAiC. </p>



<p>But the studies that reveal the Arctic’s
active nightlife barely scrape the surface. Many were performed in the lower
Arctic at roughly 80° N, but MOSAiC floated closer to the North Pole — where
winter is darker and lasts longer — than any other ship yet during Arctic
winter. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-image alignwide size-full"><img alt="Polar bear guard" class="wp-image-3086616" src="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/041120_sh_arctic_inline10_1030.jpg" /><span class="caption wp-caption-3086616">A guard scans the horizon for polar bears. During polar night, he has to rely on his headlamp and spotlights from the ship.</span><span class="credit wp-credit-3086616">Lukas Piotrowski</span></figure>



<p>MOSAiC went <em>north</em> of the
northern lights, to a completely different marine environment with an ocean
that extends four kilometers deep (as opposed to a shallow continental shelf).
As such, many of the results from past studies cannot be extrapolated to the
central Arctic. </p>



<p>So, MOSAiC researchers will conduct
physiological and genetic analyses on the life within thousands of samples in a
lab onboard the ship (some will be sent to different labs for analysis).
Although Fong returned to Germany in January, others kept the studies going all
winter. But as the mission continues, Leu and other scientists are most eager
to collect samples once another drastic change occurs in the Arctic: the return
of the sun.</p>



<h4>Spring awakening</h4>



<p>Every spring, the sun’s rays hit the top of the world for
the first time in months — creating a pink glow and warming the sea ice.
Temperatures rise, the snow and ice begin to melt and life starts to flourish.
Although polar night is a busier world than scientists initially imagined, it
doesn’t compare to spring when phytoplankton form massive blooms that provide
scrumptious meals for the rest of the Arctic food web. </p>



<p>Certain species of zooplankton, which
spend winter at great depths, migrate to the surface in the spring to feed on
the rich algal blooms. Those small animals become food for fish, eventually
supporting the rest of the food web. California gray whales, barnacle geese and
135 other species of birds migrate to the top of the world to feed on the many
animals that feed from the bloom. Arctic terns even travel 30,000 kilometers
from the Antarctic to the Arctic. The springtime feeding frenzy is — without a
doubt — the main event in the Arctic ecosystem. </p>



<p>“That’s the food that then carries the
entire food web throughout the rest of the year,” Cohen says. </p>



<p>The success of this feast depends on
the timing and location of the springtime blooms. “What happens during the
winter months sets the stage for the coming productivity peak,” Leu says. So
scientists are eager to better understand those dark months. </p>



<p>Knowing how different species of algae
respond to low levels of light, for example, will help scientists better
predict when and where those blooms might appear and even their composition. </p>



<p>It’s a crucial question now that the
timing and location of these blooms are being altered by climate change. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img alt="Nicole Hildebrandt hold zooplankton" class="wp-image-3086614" src="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/041120_sh_arctic_inline8_680.jpg" /><span class="caption wp-caption-3086614">Alfred Wegener biologist Nicole Hildebrandt looks at zooplankton collected from under the ice floe.</span><span class="credit wp-credit-3086614">Esther Horvath</span></figure>



<p>In 2011, Kevin Arrigo, a marine
biologist at Stanford University, was on a research cruise between Alaska and
Siberia, deep in the Chukchi Sea ice pack, when instruments submerged a few
meters below the surface registered high concentrations of chlorophyll — a
proxy for phytoplankton. It seemed impossible since he was surrounded by ice
and snow. Both would reflect any incoming solar radiation, leaving no sunlight
for plankton in the waters below. “We thought our instruments were
malfunctioning,” Arrigo says. A bloom simply could not exist below the ice. But
when his team drilled a hole through the thin sheet and hit the ocean below,
green water flushed upward. </p>



<p>“It was an eye-opener,” Arrigo says. “I would have bet my life savings that there was no way you would ever find anything like this under the ice.” But only a phytoplankton bloom would have colored those waters, and <a href="https://science.sciencemag.org/content/336/6087/1408.abstract?sid=ef601a8c-1488-4034-9051-d9a81e0358af">it was as big as Montana</a>.</p>



<p>There’s a simple explanation for this surprise finding. A stunning 95 percent of the Arctic’s oldest, thickest ice <a href="https://www.arctic.noaa.gov/Report-Card/Report-Card-2018/ArtMID/7878/ArticleID/772/Executive-Summary">has disappeared in the last 33 years</a>, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. Now, the top of the globe contains mostly young, thin ice that allows light to penetrate into the upper ocean and reach the phytoplankton below. </p>



<p>Since Arrigo’s 2011 study, roughly a
dozen blooms have been spotted under the ice. “It’s just an absolutely amazing
discovery that we never would have expected,” says Chris Horvat, a climate
scientist at Brown University in Providence, R.I. </p>



<p>In addition, algal blooms have been
spotted earlier in the season and creeping farther north — changes that will
have ramifications across the Arctic. If blooms occur in a new location or at a
different time, grazers, from zooplankton to Arctic terns, might miss the
blooms entirely. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img alt="plankton samples" class="wp-image-3086615" src="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/041120_sh_arctic_inline9_680.jpg" /><span class="caption wp-caption-3086615">A net raked under the sea in early December pulled up several samples of zooplankton for study in the ship’s lab.</span><span class="credit wp-credit-3086615">Esther Horvath</span></figure>



<p>That change worries Fong. “It’s like
bees and flowers,” she says. Plants bloom based on the temperature, but usually
require insects for pollination. If those insects are not at a stage in their
life cycle to be active pollinators, then a fruit tree that blooms too early
won’t produce any fruit. </p>



<p>“Phytoplankton can grow and grow and
grow,” Fong says. “But the only way that material gets transferred up the food
web is if the primary consumers are there and able to graze upon them.” </p>



<p>When blooms occurred later in the
season, the waters were quite warm; zooplankton reproduced and their offspring
munched on phytoplankton falling through the water column. But now that blooms
are occurring earlier, when the water is still colder, the zooplankton have not
yet reproduced; there’s no offspring to scoop up the phytoplankton. </p>



<p>In this new scenario of earlier
blooms, most of the phytoplankton could reach the bottom of the ocean causing
the low-lying ecosystem to thrive. Gray whales, walruses and clams all feed on
the bottom. But bowhead whales, Arctic cod and salmon feed in the water column —
and may thus suffer the consequences if zooplankton miss their chance to dine. </p>



<p>Though of course much of this is speculation based on early changes. “The jury is still out on exactly what will happen,” Horvat says. MOSAiC scientists will need to complete their dark sojourn to shed light on the changing Arctic. </p>

At this writing, COVID-19 has affected more than <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/cases-updates/world-map.html">173 countries</a>, causing <a href="https://www.who.int/docs/default-source/coronaviruse/situation-reports/20200403-sitrep-74-covid-19-mp.pdf?sfvrsn=4e043d03_4">972,303 infections and 50,322 deaths</a>. Highly contagious, coronavirus spreads through human-to-human contact, with the number of infections doubling every three days. Neither vaccine nor cure exists for COVID-19, although several <a href="https://www.nih.gov/news-events/news-releases/nih-clinical-trial-investigational-vaccine-covid-19-begins">clinical trials</a> are underway. Prevention is cure, and physical distancing is the most effective prevention endeavor.</p>
<p>Mandatory quarantines or non-mandatory stay-at-home advisories are in effect in countries around the world, affecting one third of the global population. Homebound, people are physically distant from wider social networks: school-age children are receiving homeschooling; college students are attending online classes from home; non-essential service employees are working from home.</p>
<blockquote><p>Globally, one in three women experience domestic violence over their lifetimes, and 4-12% during pregnancy.</p></blockquote>
<p><img alt="" class="size-medium wp-image-11833 alignleft" height="300" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2020/04/300px-Purple_ribbon.svg_-191x300.png" width="191" />Unfortunately, stay-at-home may not mean safer-at-home for millions of women worldwide. Home is where women experience violence in the hands of their spouses or extended family members. <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17027732">Domestic violence</a>, including physical, sexual, reproductive, emotional, or economic, is a health and human rights violation, leading to mental and physical health consequences, including death. Globally, <a href="https://www.who.int/reproductivehealth/publications/violence/9789241564625/en/">one in three women</a> experience domestic violence over their lifetimes, and <a href="https://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/handle/10665/70764/WHO_RHR_11.35_eng.pdf?sequence=1">4-12% </a>during pregnancy.</p>
<p>Domestic violence can be an unintended consequence of COVID-19 lockdowns, which have been essential for suppressing the spread. Prior evidence makes it a possibility: domestic violence rates went up during <a href="https://connect.springerpub.com/content/sgrvv/25/5/588">emergencies</a> in the <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/44126540?seq=1">US</a>, and <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/1077801210377649?casa_token=GjwbzDKcC64AAAAA:3Zy3qOkMZDtbf5AcFxAlmRNIGgvC13FAD6d6bdw9rRFnWYlcXpU6tRFV6Pa9o3sWX_PXclVWK-HC">globally</a>. High risk (stuck in home with abuser), low protection (socially distant from family, friends, neighbors, coworkers) makes it a probability. Indeed, frontline workers <a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/coronavirus-live-updates/2020/04/06/827908402/global-lockdowns-resulting-in-horrifying-surge-in-domestic-violence-u-n-warns">from a diverse set of countries</a> and cultures, including <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/police-see-rise-domestic-violence-calls-amid-coronavirus-lockdown-n1176151">USA</a>, <a href="https://www.euronews.com/2020/03/28/domestic-violence-cases-jump-30-during-lockdown-in-france">France</a>, <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-italy-violence/in-italy-support-groups-fear-lockdown-is-silencing-domestic-abuse-victims-idUSKBN21M0PM">Italy</a>, <a href="https://www.telesurenglish.net/news/COVID-19-Fears-of-Domestic-Violence-Rise-as-Millions-Confined-20200328-0009.html">Spain</a>, <a href="https://www.straitstimes.com/asia/australianz/rise-in-family-abuse-cases-in-australia-linked-to-covid-19">Australia</a>, <a href="https://in-cyprus.philenews.com/sharp-rise-in-domestic-violence-amid-covid-19-outbreak/">Cyprus</a>, <a href="http://www.israelnationalnews.com/News/News.aspx/277940">Brazil</a>, <a href="https://supchina.com/2020/03/24/covid-19-fuels-domestic-violence-in-china/">China</a>, <a href="https://www.nepalitimes.com/latest/lockdown-and-the-surge-in-domestic-violence/">Nepal</a>, <a href="https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/domestic-abuse-cases-rise-as-covid-19-lockdown-turns-into-captivity-for-many-women-819653.html">India</a>, <a href="https://www.arabnews.com/node/1652146/middle-east">Lebanon</a>, and <a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/coronavirus-live-updates/2020/04/06/827908402/global-lockdowns-resulting-in-horrifying-surge-in-domestic-violence-u-n-warns">South Africa</a>, have reported an increase in the number of calls to domestic-violence hotlines, or of police complaints. In absence of population-based estimates before and after COVID-19 lockdowns, existing reports are invaluable alternatives, indicating, at a minimum, an upswing in violence re-victimization, potentially globally.</p>
<p>To be clear, domestic violence happens in homosexual as well as heterosexual relationships. Violence can be perpetrated by both men and women against their partners of the same or opposite gender. However, men’s perpetration of violence against women is the <a href="https://www.who.int/violence_injury_prevention/violence/gender.pdf">most common form</a> of domestic violence worldwide, with consequences more intense, lingering <a href="https://www.nber.org/papers/w24802">across generations</a>.</p>
<p>Preventing a potential outbreak of domestic violence during an emergency seems plausible. Conceptually, programs found to be effective in preventing conditions triggering men’s perpetration of domestic violence are likely be effective in reducing domestic violence. I discuss three such conditions and programs. Intersecting vulnerabilities (younger age, poverty, lower education levels) increase women’s vulnerability to experiencing multiple violence-triggering conditions, simultaneously.</p>
<blockquote><p>COVID-induced economic recession heightens the risk of marital conflicts, often resulting in men’s violence perpetration</p></blockquote>
<p>First, COVID-induced economic recession, and consequent <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4860387/">livelihood loss</a> by either or both partners, and subsequent financially stressful times leaving families with resource constraints for life essentials, or the need for rationing, heightens the risk of marital conflicts, often resulting in men’s violence perpetration. Conversely, potential COVID-19 exposures through employment in essential services can be traumatic, triggering <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/24/us/coronavirus-lockdown-domestic-violence.html">marital conflicts</a>. <a href="https://behavioralscientist.org/the-cognitive-burden-of-poverty/">Cognitive burdens</a> (preoccupation with financial woes impedes <img alt="" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-11831" height="200" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2020/04/wallet-300x200.jpg" width="300" />one’s ability to do the right thing; fear of disease exposure) make both partners vulnerable to violence perpetration; the higher social position of men make them more susceptible. The risk is greater for men holding traditional views on gender roles (feeling that they have failed as “the provider of the family,” and at-risk of losing power and control), growing up experiencing or watching violence (getting cues of action from “<a href="https://www.worldbank.org/content/dam/Worldbank/Publications/WDR/WDR%202015/WDR-2015-Full-Report.pdf">mental models</a>” of conflict resolutions), or are engaged in <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/j.1360-0443.2005.00994.x">substance use</a> (blurring judgement, misplaced priorities), compared to men with comparable levels of vulnerability and susceptibility but without such attributes.</p>
<p>Second, disruptions in the operation of service-delivery institutions (e.g., schools; day care centers; restaurants; dry cleaners) and subsequent abrupt need for (primarily) women assuming significantly more roles than usual can result in women’s excessive workload, stress, anxiety, maladaptive coping including substance use, increasing their vulnerabilities to domestic violence (re)victimization.</p>
<p>Third, homebound for long, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/11/upshot/gender-roles-housework.html">couples</a>, even those more egalitarian, may experience increasing intensification or rebound of traditional gender roles and relations, with women, charged with caregiving among other domestic responsibilities, becoming the default target of blame for discomforts, inconveniences, or unmet needs. A prolonged, 24/7 stay at a proximity increases the use of household space and resources for meeting most daily-living essentials, increasing the frequency of interactions between intimate partners and, thereby, opportunities for marital conflicts.</p>
<blockquote><p>Easier access to domestic violence hotlines and to shelters that are safe will improve women’s ability to seek help despite constraints</p></blockquote>
<p>As for violence prevention and mitigation, the following three policies or programs seem promising. However, a broader, multisectoral approach to address women’s deprivation in terms of education, nutrition, healthcare, family planning or economic empowerment underlying women’s vulnerability to violence should be integrated into overall emergency preparedness efforts.</p>
<p>First, a financial safety net (for example, <a href="https://scholars.unh.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1076&amp;context=carsey">unemployment insurance in the US</a>, India’s direct unconditional cash transfers to <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/govt-launches-mega-cash-transfer-to-fight-covid-19/articleshow/74975904.cms">women</a>, and poor households, etc.) will likely keep household’s overall consumption at a comparable level, enhancing women’s capacity for violence-risks management, and, thereb<img alt="" class="size-medium wp-image-11829 alignleft" height="300" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2020/04/domvio-256x300.jpg" width="256" />y, enhancing the safety of women and their children. Second, addressing factors that trigger violence during stressful times is key. For example, a ban on alcohol sales, limiting hours of alcohol sales, or limiting the volume sold per person, as appropriate in each context, will curb access to alcoholic beverages, reducing excessive alcohol consumption and related harms including violence against women and children. Third, easier access to domestic violence hotlines and to shelters that are safe will improve women’s ability to seek help despite constraints (i.e., abuser is nearby) and relocate (i.e., women can still practice physical distancing in shelters), significantly limiting the risk of violence re-victimization. To ensure easy access, countries must ensure: (a) adequate resources for domestic-violence services and shelters as an essential service; and (b) <a href="https://www.worldbank.org/en/news/press-release/2018/02/01/more-than-1-billion-women-lack-legal-protection-against-domestic-sexual-violence-finds-world-bank-study">legal protection against domestic violence</a>.</p>
<p>It’s in our common interest, as human beings and social and economic actors, to be serious about integrating domestic violence prevention and mitigation into COVID-19 preparedness and relief efforts. The alternative is unethical, keeping a blind eye to human right violations, and seems suboptimal: needing direct medical and mental health care services, a <a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/coronavirus-live-updates/2020/04/06/827908402/global-lockdowns-resulting-in-horrifying-surge-in-domestic-violence-u-n-warns">global surge</a> in domestic violence could be <a href="https://www.worldbank.org/en/news/opinion/2013/03/07/putting-a-price-on-violence-against-women-and-girls">costly</a>, potentially compromising COVID-19 responses inside and outside the health sector.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/largest-arctic-ozone-hole-ever-measured-hovering-over-north-pole">The largest Arctic ozone hole ever measured is hovering over the North Pole</a></h4>

<p>A curious confluence of
atmospheric events has produced the largest ozone hole ever measured <a href="https://ozonewatch.gsfc.nasa.gov/NH.html">over
the Arctic</a>. </p>



<p>A powerful polar vortex has trapped
especially frigid air in the atmosphere above the North Pole, allowing
high-altitude clouds to form in the stratosphere, where the ozone layer also
sits. Within those clouds, chlorofluorocarbons and hydrochlorofluorocarbons
already high in the atmosphere — gases used as refrigerants — react with
ultraviolet rays from the sun to release chlorine and bromine atoms, which in turn react with and deplete the ozone. </p>



<p>Such conditions are <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/antarctica-ozone-hole-top-science-stories-2016">more often seen over Antarctica</a>, leading to a more frequent and much larger ozone
hole in the Southern Hemisphere (<em>SN:
12/14/16</em>). </p>



<p>The ozone layer sits in the
stratosphere, an atmospheric layer between about 10 and 50 kilometers above the
ground, where it protects life on Earth from UV radiation from the sun. During the Southern Hemisphere’s spring, as much as 70
percent of the ozone can disappear; in some places, the ozone concentration
drops to zero. </p>





<p>During the Northern
Hemisphere’s spring, the Arctic ozone layer also tends to thin. But the
Arctic’s average winter temperatures are typically warmer than Antarctica’s, so
it’s unusual for cold masses of air to be trapped around the pole for a month
or longer and give the gases time to chip away at the ozone. </p>



<p>In April 2011, though, Arctic
ozone thinned <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/arctic-ozone-loss-2011-unprecedented">by about 40 percent</a>, setting a new record (<em>SN: 10/3/11</em>). This year’s depletion,
which currently <a href="https://www.esa.int/Applications/Observing_the_Earth/Copernicus/Sentinel-5P/Unusual_ozone_hole_opens_over_the_Arctic">covers less than 1 million square kilometers</a>, has already surpassed that record, say researchers
with the European Space Agency, based in Paris. </p>



<p>In the Arctic, the sun is
just now starting to peek over the horizon following the end of the Northern Hemisphere’s
winter, so the thinned ozone shield does not yet represent a strong threat to
human health, researchers note. </p>

</div>NASA satellites tracked how much ozone was in the stratosphere over the North Pole from November 2019 to April 4, 2020. Areas with the least amount of ozone appear blue and purple, while those with the most appear yellow and red. In mid-February, a strong polar vortex trapped very cold air around the pole, allowing high-altitude clouds to form in the stratosphere. In those clouds, refrigerant gases reacted with sunlight to release ozone-destroying chlorine and bromine. By early April, an ozone hole bigger than any previously measured had opened over the Arctic.</figure>

                <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/great-barrier-reef-suffering-most-widespread-bleaching-ever-recorded">The Great Barrier Reef is suffering its most widespread bleaching ever recorded</a></h4>

<p>Australia’s
Great Barrier Reef is currently experiencing its third mass bleaching in just five
years — and it is the most widespread bleaching event ever recorded. </p>



<p><a href="https://www.jcu.edu.au/news/releases/2020/april/climate-change-triggers-great-barrier-reef-bleaching">Results from aerial surveys</a> conducted along the 2,000-kilometer-long reef over nine days in late
March, and released April 7, show that 25 percent of 1,036 individuals reefs
surveyed were severely affected, with more than 60 percent of corals bleached.
Another 35 percent of the reefs had less extensive bleaching.   </p>



<p>“This is the
second most severe event we have seen, but it is by far the most widespread,”
says marine biologist Terry Hughes, director of the ARC Centre of Excellence
for Coral Reef Studies at James Cook University in Townsville, Australia, who
led the aerial surveys along with scientists from the Great Barrier Reef Marine
Park Authority. </p>



<p>What is most
concerning this year is that the southern third of the reef, which escaped
unscathed in 2016 and 2017, is now extensively bleached, too. “For the first
time we have seen bleaching in all three regions of the reef — the north, the
middle and the south,” Hughes says.  </p>





<p>Bleaching
occurs when <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/reef-rehab-could-help-threatened-corals-make-comeback">corals experience periods of unusually high summer sea
temperatures</a>, and they eject the
symbiotic algae that both nourish corals and give them some of their colors (<em>SN: 10/18/16</em>). It’s not a guaranteed
death sentence, but many corals will not survive. </p>



<p>The first mass
bleaching recorded on the Great Barrier Reef was in 1998, with the next in
2002. But bleaching events in <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/blog/science-ticker/coral-die-great-barrier-reef-reaches-record-levels">2016</a>, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/blog/science-ticker/great-barrier-reef-coral-bleaching-global-warming">2017</a> and now 2020
have scientists seriously concerned, as there has been little time for reefs to
recover in between episodes (<em>SN: 11/29/16</em>;
<em>SN: 4/11/17</em>).  </p>



<p>“We are seeing
more and more bleaching events and the gap between them is shrinking,” Hughes
says. “Those gaps are important because that’s the opportunity for corals to
rebound and make a recovery…. It takes about a decade for the fastest-growing
corals to fully rebound.” </p>



<div class="wp-block-sciencenews-content-sidebar">
<h3>Too hot spots</h3>



<p>Aerial surveys along the 2,000-kilometer-long Great Barrier Reef over nine days in late March revealed more widespread bleaching than ever before recorded. While the reef suffered bad bleaching events in 2016 and 2017, most of the impact then was north of Townsville. In 2020, damage was recorded from the tip of the continent to well south of Townsville.</p>

</div>



<p>While
scientists saw reefs in the northern and central regions of the Great Barrier
Reef begin to recover following 2016 and 2017, they now have concerns that
progress has been for nothing.</p>



<p>“They are just
getting hammered by these repetitive, destructive heat waves,” says Ove
Hoegh-Guldberg, who studies coral reefs at the University of Queensland in
Brisbane, Australia. “If this continues over the next 10 years or so, there
won’t be much of a Great Barrier Reef left.” </p>



<p>Hoegh-Guldberg
— who is also the deputy director of the ARC Centre of Excellence for Coral
Reef Studies, but was not involved in the survey work — says while the extent
of the bleaching is an “absolute tragedy, it’s one we’ve been expecting.” February
2020 had the warmest sea surface temperatures on the Great Barrier Reef since
records began in 1900, according <a href="https://www.abc.net.au/news/2020-03-15/cyclone-great-barrier-reef-bleaching-record-seas-temperatures/12050102">to figures released in March</a> by Australia’s Bureau of Meteorology. </p>



<p>Hoegh-Guldberg
argues that, aside from governments taking action to reduce greenhouse gas
emissions, one thing that can be done is to map out those individual reefs that
are less exposed to <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/ipcc-how-climate-change-already-altering-oceans-ice-future">the effects of climate change</a> than others, such as areas protected by upwellings of cooler water (<em>SN: 9/25/19</em>). These sites may be the
source of coral larvae to regenerate bleached reefs in the future, and should
be especially protected from other damage, such as from agricultural runoff, he

<p>“That’s one
place I think we can do further work,” Hoegh-Guldberg says. “Identify those
areas that are least exposed to climate change and which have the greatest role
to play in any renewal.” </p>



<p>But Hughes
notes that “the problem with that approach is that we are running out of reefs
that haven’t yet bleached.” He led a study published in <em>Nature</em> in 2019 showing an <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-019-1081-y">89 percent decrease in numbers of coral larvae</a> released in 2018 from reefs that had been damaged in 2016 and 2017.
“The ability of the reef to rebound has been compromised,” he says. </p>



<p>“We are in uncharted territory in terms of rebound potential. We are not sure what the Great Barrier Reef will recover to anymore. The mix of species is changing and really quickly,” Hughes says. “Optimistically, if temperatures don’t rise too much more, we’ll still have a reef, but it’s going to look very different.”  </p>

                <h4><a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2020/04/07/hard-workers-are-more-inspiring-than-geniuses/">Hard Workers Are More Inspiring Than Geniuses</a></h4>

<p><em>By </em><a href="http://emilyoliviareynolds.com/">Emily Reynolds</a></p>
<p>Albert Einstein is often used as the ultimate inspirational figure in science: an untamed genius with an abundance of innate brilliance. The proliferation of memes and inspirational quotes about his allegedly underwhelming school performance only serves to highlight exactly how naturally brilliant he really was, succeeding against the odds.</p>
<p>But, it turns out, he might not be quite as inspiring as you think: <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/01973533.2020.1734006">according to a study</a> published in <em>Basic and Applied Social Psychology, </em>it may in fact be hard work, not innate genius, that really inspires people to get into STEM.<span id="more-39443"></span></p>
<p>The first study focused on two specific scientists: Einstein, who is generally viewed as a genius whose success came from his talent, and Edison, whose success is seen to have come from hard work — famously, it took him over one thousand attempts to successfully create the lightbulb. Danfei Hu from Penn State and colleagues gave 176 participants a story about either Einstein or Edison, both of which included details about struggles, challenges and setbacks the scientists had supposedly faced during their career (in fact, the stories for each scientist were exactly the same).</p>
<p>Participants then filled in a survey to measure their views on talent and intelligence, rating how much they agreed with statements including “only geniuses can be good scientists”, “some people just aren’t cut out for science” and “you have a certain amount of intelligence, and you can’t do much to change it”. Participants then completed an apparently unconnected maths task, designed to investigate their approaches to problem-solving.</p>
<p>Those in the Edison condition were less likely to see exceptional talent as necessary for a scientist’s success, and slightly more likely to believe that intelligence was malleable or changeable. This group also performed better on the mathematical task, suggesting that they’d received a boost in motivation by reading about a scientist known for his work ethic.</p>
<p>To look at the impact of fame on motivation and inspiration, the team recruited 162 participants for a second study. Participants once again read one of two identical stories about a struggling scientist, half reading about Einstein and the other about Mark Johnson, a fictional scientist whom none of them had heard of.</p>
<p>Again, participants who read about Mark Johnson were less likely to believe that innate genius or talent was necessary for success than those who read about Einstein — and they performed better in the maths test, too. This suggests that a non-famous scientist may in fact make for a more effective role model than a famous, “genius” scientist.</p>
<p>A final study looked at all three scientists simultaneously: 288 participants read either about the struggles of Edison, Einstein or the non-famous scientist. Those who read about Einstein appeared less motivated than those who read about the non-famous scientist, while those who read about Edison were more motivated, suggesting that the two role models had opposite effects.</p>
<p>The team suggests that being exposed to a stereotypically “genius” scientist makes people feel brilliance is a prerequisite to succeed — that it’s essential, rather than an additional benefit. As many people don’t particularly see themselves as innately brilliant, their performance — and their interest and motivation to do well in science — is therefore diminished.</p>
<p>The successes of someone like Edison, however, might seem more in reach — his example suggests that scientific successes are related more to effort and self-control than they are to genius, making people feel more inclined to try.</p>
<p>Role models can play an important part in efforts to encourage a wider range of people to pursue STEM both educationally and professionally: female mentors, for example, have been shown to increase female students’ sense of belonging in engineering settings. Understanding what makes certain role models effective could therefore help this process considerably, allowing universities and other institutions to develop mentoring programmes that really help make STEM subjects more diverse and equal places to be.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/space-red-giant-stars-that-eat-planets-might-shine-less-brightly">Red giant stars that eat planets might shine less brightly</a></h4>

<p>When giant stars eat giant planets,
their starlight may shine a bit less brightly. That dimming could affect how astronomers measure distances across
the universe — and
possibly even put past measurements in doubt. </p>



<p>“You would think the planet
would be a small perturbation to the star,” says astrophysicist Licia Verde. “It
turns out that it’s not.” Those <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2003.11499">perturbations
may even help explain</a> why
estimates for how fast the universe is expanding disagree, Verde and her colleagues argue in a paper posted March
25 at arXiv.org.</p>



<p>When stars similar in mass
to the sun burn through most of the hydrogen in their cores, their outer layers
puff up until the stars are hundreds of times their original sizes, becoming
red giants. At a certain core density, red giants were all thought to reach the
same peak brightness. </p>



<p>That uniform brightness has
helped astronomers estimate cosmic distances. It’s hard to know how far away a star
is without knowing its intrinsic brightness — a star may appear dim because
it’s very far away, or just because it’s dim, or both. Because red giants
always peak at a certain brightness, they can act as distance markers across
the universe, giving astronomers cosmic landmarks to measure the space between
Earth and far-off galaxies. </p>





<p>Astronomers have seen signs
that red giants <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/toasty-planets-circle-stellar-heart">engulf nearby planets</a> while expanding (<em>SN: 12/21/11</em>). Verde and
astrophysicist Raul Jimenez, both of the University of Barcelona, along with Uffe
Gråe Jørgensen, an astrophysicist at the University of Copenhagen, wondered if
those planetary meals could change how the star shines. If so, that would mean
a red giant’s peak brightness is a little less reliable as a uniform constant
than previously thought. </p>



<p>There are a few different
ways a planet could change the star’s brightness, the team reasoned: If the
planet gave the star’s core more matter to burn, that could turn up the lights,
making the star seem nearer than it is. Or eating a planet could stir up the star’s
outer gas layers in a way that made light particles, or photons, bounce around
more within the star’s atmosphere. Then fewer photons would escape, and the
star would appear dimmer.</p>



<p>Computer simulations to test
these scenarios would be slow and expensive. So the team did some rough calculations
to see if simulations would even be worth it. And in fact, those calculations
showed that the extra mass from ingesting a planet doesn’t matter very much on
its own. But if a large enough planet plunges into the star at high speed, it
could stir up the star’s outer layers “like a spoon in a teacup,” Jimenez says.
In that scenario, the star’s brightness drops by up to 5 percent, the team estimates.
</p>



<p>That slight shift could make
a big difference to cosmology, and particularly to estimates of the universe’s
expansion rate — a
number known as the Hubble constant. To measure the Hubble constant,
astronomers need to know precisely how fast cosmic objects appear to be
receding thanks to cosmic expansion, as well as how far those objects actually
are from Earth. </p>



<p>So astronomers use objects with
known luminosities as so-called “standard candles” to help determine cosmic
distances. Red giants are one example; supernovas and stars called Cepheids are
others. </p>



<p>But measurements using different
candles have resulted in different estimates for the Hubble constant. Another
method using details of how matter was distributed in the very early universe gave
yet another Hubble constant value. The discrepancies have led to a <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/debate-universe-expansion-rate-hubble-constant-physics-crisis">crisis in cosmology</a>: Either some of the measurements are wrong, or the universe behaved
differently in its early epochs than it does today. That would mean long-held
ideas about how the universe formed and evolved may need revision (<em>SN:
7/30/19</em>).</p>



<p>“People believe [the
mismatch] could be a signature of new physics,” Jimenez says. “That’s the
excitement.” </p>



<p>Cosmologist Wendy Freedman of
the University of Chicago, who measured the Hubble constant using red giant
stars, thinks more detailed studies are needed to figure out if planetary meals
are a problem for the Hubble constant estimate. Even if some stars shine less
brightly because they’ve ingested a planet, that won’t make a difference if the
same thing is happening in every galaxy, she
notes. </p>



<p>Astronomers also have used
both Cepheids and red giants in a single galaxy to measure that galaxy’s
distance from Earth, and the two methods give the same answer. That suggests cosmologists
might not need to worry about red stars’ dimming after devouring planets. </p>



<p>“Theoretical components and
constraints you can get from existing observations suggest that, at the moment,
this is not a serious issue,” Freedman says.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/pbs-documentary-gene-history-genetics-promise-pitfalls">The PBS documentary ‘The Gene’ showcases genetics’ promise and pitfalls</a></h4>

<p>The genetic code to all
life on Earth, both simple and complex, comes down to four basic letters: A, C,
T and G. </p>



<p>Untangling the role that
these letters play in life’s blueprint has allowed scientists to understand
what makes everything from bacteria to people the way they are. But as researchers
have learned more, they have also sought ways to tinker with this blueprint,
bringing ethical dilemmas into the spotlight. <a href="https://www.pbs.org/show/gene/"><em>The Gene</em></a>, a two-part PBS documentary from executive producer Ken Burns
airing April 7 and 14, explores the benefits and risks that come with
deciphering life’s code.</p>



<p>The film begins with one
of those ethical challenges. The opening moments describe how biophysicist He
Jiankui used the gene-editing tool CRISPR/Cas9 <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/gene-edited-babies-top-science-stories-2018-yir">to alter the embryos of twin girls</a> who were born in China in 2018 (<em>SN: 12/17/18</em>). Worldwide, critics
condemned the move, claiming it was irresponsible to change the girls’ DNA, as
experts don’t yet fully understand the consequences.    </p>



<p>“This moment heralded
the arrival of a new era,” narrator David Costabile says. “An era in which
humans are no longer at the mercy of their genes, but can control and even
change them.”</p>





<p>The story sets the stage
for a prominent theme throughout the documentary: While genetics holds
incredible potential to improve the lives of people with genetic diseases,
there are always those who will push science to its ethical limits. But the
driving force in the film is the inquisitive nature of the scientists
determined to uncover what makes us human. 
</p>



<p><em>The Gene, </em>based on the <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/science-news-favorite-books-2016">book of the same name by Siddhartha Mukherjee</a> (<em>SN:
12/18/16</em>), one of the documentary’s executive producers, highlights many of
the most famous discoveries in genetics. The film chronicles Gregor Mendel’s classic
pea experiments describing inheritance and how experts ultimately revealed in
the 1940s that DNA — a so-called “stupid molecule” composed of just four chemical
bases, adenine (A), thymine (T),
cytosine (C) and guanine (G) — is responsible for storing genetic
information. Historical footage, in
Burns’ typical style, brings to life stories describing the discovery of DNA’s
helical structure in the 1950s and the success of the Human Genome Project in
decoding the human genetic blueprint in 2003. </p>



<p>The film also touches on
a few of the ethical violations that came from these discoveries. The eugenics
movement —
in both Nazi Germany and the United States in the early 20th century — as
well as the story of the first person to die in a clinical trial for gene
therapy, in 1999, cast a morbid shadow on the narrative.  </p>

<p>Interwoven into this
timeline are personal stories from people who suffer from genetic diseases.
These vignettes help viewers grasp the hope new advances can give patients as
experts continue to wrangle with DNA in efforts to make those cures. </p>



<p>In the documentary’s
first installment, which focuses on the early days of genetics, viewers meet a family whose daughter is grappling with a
rare genetic mutation that causes her nerve cells to die. The family searches
for a cure alongside geneticist Wendy Chung of Columbia University. The second
part follows efforts to master the human genome and focuses on Audrey
Winkelsas, a molecular biologist at the National Institutes of Health studying
spinal muscular atrophy, a disease she herself has, and a family fighting to
save their son from a severe form of the condition.   </p>



<p>For science-interested viewers, the documentary does not disappoint. <em>The Gene </em>covers what seems to be every angle of genetics’ history — from the ancient belief that sperm absorbed mystical vapors to pass traits down to offspring to the discovery of DNA’s structure to modern gene editing. But the stories of the scientists and patients invested in overcoming diseases like Huntington’s and cancer make the film all the more captivating. </p>

The situation <i>had</i> to be remedied, somehow, and the material you are now reading is the proposed fix for my ailments. As to the methodology: given I've had some success in applying the Feynman Technique<sup><a class="footref" href="http://mcraveiro.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default#fn.2" id="fnr.2">2</a></sup> to <a href="http://mcraveiro.blogspot.com/2015/08/nerd-food-neurons-for-computer-geeks.html">other complex domains</a>, it seemed only natural to try to use it for this endeavour as well. Past experience also demonstrated writing is an adequate replacement for <i>in vivo</i>communication, which is just as well in this brave new world of social distancing. </p> <p>So that's that for the <i>why</i> and the <i>how</i>. But, just <i>what</i> exactly are we researching? </p></div> <div class="outline-3" id="outline-container-org038ff83"><h3 id="org038ff83">Scope</h3><div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org038ff83"><p>These posts shall largely amble where our fancy takes us, within the porous boundaries of finance. Alas, we can hardly keep calling our target domain "trading, accounting, crypto and a bit of quantitative finance, when viewed through the lens of FOSS" - descriptive though that might sound. We are Software Engineers after all, and if there is one thing we do is to name things, <i>especially</i> when we lack competence to do so<sup><a class="footref" href="http://mcraveiro.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default#fn.3" id="fnr.3">3</a></sup>. In this vein, I decided to call this motley domain of ours "Computational Finance". Should the name have merit, I'm afraid I have little claim to it, as it was shamelessly stolen from this passage in <a href="https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2016/09/how-to-teach-computational-thinking/">Wolfram's writings</a>: </p> <blockquote><p>Doctors, lawyers, teachers, farmers, whatever. The future of all these professions will be full of computational thinking. Whether it’s sensor-based medicine, computational contracts, education analytics or computational agriculture - success is going to rely on being able to do computational thinking well. </p> <p>I’ve noticed an interesting trend. Pick any field X, from archeology to zoology. There either is now a “computational X” or there soon will be. And it’s widely viewed as the future of the field. </p></blockquote> <p>These seemed like inspiring words for anyone embarking on a long and uncertain journey, so we made them our own and, in turn, it gave us a name to rally around. But what of its boundaries? One of the biggest challenges facing the reductionist is that, in the limit, <i>everything is interconnected with everything else</i>, for there is no natural halting function. Thus, if you are not careful, all paths will eventually lead you into the realm of quarks and particle physics, regardless of your starting point. Now, that would not be an entirely useful outcome. I have never found a completely satisfactory answer to this question in any on my previous meanderings, but in general I tend to follow an empiric approach and let <i>taste</i> be my guide<sup><a class="footref" href="http://mcraveiro.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default#fn.4" id="fnr.4">4</a></sup>. Granted, its probably not the scientific solution you were expecting, but it seems that there are "intuitive" boundaries in subjects, and when we hit one of those we shall stop<sup><a class="footref" href="http://mcraveiro.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default#fn.5" id="fnr.5">5</a></sup>. As an example, for our purposes we need not look in detail at legal frameworks when trying to understand financial concepts, though the two disciplines are deeply intertwined. </p></div></div> <div class="outline-3" id="outline-container-orgd3a5007"><h3 id="orgd3a5007">Structure</h3><div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orgd3a5007"><p>An issue which is closely interrelated with the previous one is on how to strike a balance between computational exploration versus domain definitions. Too much exploration and you proceed full steam ahead without knowing the meaning of things; too many boring definitions and they become just words without bringing any light to the subject under scrutiny. The sweet spot lies somewhere in the middle. </p> <p>Our approach can be described as follows. We shall try to progress very slowly and methodically through the concepts in the domain, building them up as we climb the abstraction ladder but without making them too dense and technical. We'll make extensive use of Wikipedia definitions, where possible, but keeping these focused only on the point at hand rather than exploring the myriad of possibilities around a theme. </p>  <p>Finally, we shall try to marry domain concepts with our chosen implementations - the computational experiments part - in order to illustrate their purpose and get a better understanding at what it is that they are trying to do. So, each post will be focused on one fairly narrow subject area, start with a bunch of definitions which are hopefully self-explanatory and then proceed to explore the available implementations on that topic, or code that we write ourselves. </p></div></div> <div class="outline-3" id="outline-container-org81de0c9"><h3 id="org81de0c9">Audience</h3><div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org81de0c9"><p>The target audience for this material is the fabled <i>homo developus</i>, that non-existent "standard developer" - in this particular case, one moderately competent on C++ but unfamiliar with computational finance. On the "finance" part, if you are already familiar with the domain, you will no doubt find the content <i>very</i> slow going. I'm afraid this is by design: the objective is to try to build the concepts on a solid foundation for those <i>not in the know</i>, so slowness is unavoidable<sup><a class="footref" href="http://mcraveiro.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default#fn.6" id="fnr.6">6</a></sup>. </p> <p>With regards to the computational part: the astute reader will likely point out that there are a great deal of tutorials on QuantLib, ORE and many other libraries of a similar ilk, and many books have been written on quantitative finance. One could be forgiven for wondering if there is a need to pile on more literature onto a seemingly already crowded subject. </p> <p>In our defence, we are yet to find work that directly targets "plain" software developers and provides them with a sufficiently broad view of the domain. In addition, most of the existing material is aimed at either those with strong mathematical abilities but no domain knowledge, or its converse, leaving many gaps in the understanding. What we are instead aiming for is to target those with strong programming abilities but no particular knowledge of either computational finance <i>or</i> mathematics. And this leads us nicely to our next topic. </p></div></div> <div class="outline-3" id="outline-container-org04a295b"><h3 id="org04a295b">Mathematics</h3><div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org04a295b"><p>Our assumption is that you, dear reader, are not able to attain deep levels of understanding by staring at page after page of complex mathematical formulae. I, for one, certainly cannot. Unfortunately, non-trivial mathematics is difficult to avoid when covering a subject matter of this nature so, as a counterweight, we shall strive to use it sparingly and only from a software engineering <i>application</i>perspective. Note that this approach is clearly not suitable for the mathematically savvy amongst us, as they will find it unnecessarily laboured; then again, our focus lies elsewhere. </p> <p>Our core belief is that an <i>average reader</i> (like me) should be able to attain a software engineer's intuition of <i>how things work</i> just by fooling around with software models of formulae. The reason why I am very confident on this regard is because that's how developers learn: by coding and seeing what happens. In fact, it is this very tight feedback loop between having an idea and experimenting with it that got many of us hooked into programming in the first place, so its a very powerful tool in the motivational arsenal. And, as it turns out, these ideas are related to Wolfram's concept of <a href="https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/notes-3-12--history-of-experimental-mathematics/">Experimental Mathematics</a>. Ultimately, our aspiration is to copy the approach taken by Klein in <a href="https://codingthematrix.com/">Coding the Matrix</a>, though perhaps that sets the bar a tad too high. Well, at least you get the spirit of the approach. </p></div></div> <div class="outline-3" id="outline-container-org3d4740f"><h3 id="org3d4740f">Cryptos</h3><div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org3d4740f"><p>Another rather peculiar idea we pursued is the use of cryptocurrencies throughout, to the exclusion of <i>everything else</i>. Whilst very popular in the media, where they are known as <i>cryptos</i>, in truth cryptocurrencies still have a limited presence in the "real" world of finance, and nowhere more so than in derivatives - <i>i.e.</i>, the bulk of our analysis. So at first blush, this is a most puzzling choice. We have decided to do so for three reasons. </p> <p>Firstly, just because I wanted to learn more about cryptos. Secondly, because there is a need to bridge the knowledge gap between these two distinct worlds of finance; to blend the old with the new if you will. Personally, I think it will be interesting to see what the proliferation of derivatives will do to cryptos - but for that we need to disseminate financial knowledge. Finally, and most important of all, because in order to properly illustrate all of the concepts we shall cover, and to drive the open source libraries to their potential, one needs <i>vast amounts of data of the right kind</i>. Lets elaborate further on this point. </p> <p>One of the biggest problems with any material in quantitative finance is in obtaining data sets which are sufficiently rich to cover all of the concepts being explained. This, in my opinion, is one of the key shortcomings with most tutorials: they either assume users can source the data themselves, or provide a small data set to prove a very specific point but which is insufficient for wider exploration<sup><a class="footref" href="http://mcraveiro.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default#fn.7" id="fnr.7">7</a></sup>. This document takes a slightly different approach. We will base ourselves on a <i>simulated world</i> - a parallel reality if you'd like, thinly anchored to our reality by freely available data taken from the crypto markets. We shall then generate <i>all</i> of the remaining data, to the level of precision, richness and consistency required both to drive the code samples, but also to allow for "immersive" exploration. In fact, the <i>very processes for data generation</i> will be used as a pathway for domain exploration. </p> <p>Of course, generated data is not perfect - <i>i.e.</i>, <i>realistic</i> it is not, by definition - but our point is to understand the concepts, not to create new quant models that trade in the real world, so it is adequate for our needs. In addition, the data sets and code samples, as well as the means used to derive them shall be part of a git repository under an open source licence, so they can be extended and improved over time. </p> <p>If you are not familiar with cryptos, don't worry. For starters, we can <i>assume</i> the intricate mechanistic details to a large extent - the blockchain and so forth - and introduce key concepts as required. We need not concern ourselves with this because there is plenty of freely available material covering it in excruciating detail, and designed specifically for software engineers. Instead, we shall treat cryptos <i>as if they were regular currencies</i>, except where they are just <i>too different</i> - in which case we'll point out the differences. Its a bit of a strange approach, but hopefully it will produce the desired results. </p></div></div> <div class="outline-3" id="outline-container-org92cf76f"><h3 id="org92cf76f">Non Goals</h3><div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org92cf76f"><p>If you are trying to learn techniques on how to trade, this is not the material for you.

<p>As the world continues to grapple with the COVID-19 pandemic, <a href="http://arxiv.org/">arXiv</a> staff and leadership would like to extend a heartfelt thanks to our community of volunteers, as well as the authors submitting their work to <a href="http://arXiv.org">arXiv.org</a>.</p>
<p>More than <a href="https://arxiv.org/moderators/">180 moderators</a>, representing 22 countries across the globe, have continued to sift through thousands of submissions, ensure quality, and post research on arxiv.org despite significant disruptions to their personal and professional lives.</p>
<p>Since the World Health Organization declared the outbreak a “public health emergency of international concern” on January 30, 2020, more than 26,000 scholarly works have been announced on the site, including <a href="https://arxiv.org/covid19search">many related to the coronavirus</a>. March 2020 was the second busiest month in arXiv history, with 14,415 new papers posted. This is a testament to the astounding effectiveness of arXiv’s moderators. It also reflects the incredible vibrancy of the global research community and the fact that the pursuit of knowledge continues despite the pandemic. We’re proud that arXiv is used extensively to share knowledge across disciplines and across the world.</p>
<p>Members of the <a href="https://arxiv.org/about/people/scientific_ad_board">Scientific</a> and <a href="https://arxiv.org/about/people/member_ad_board">Member Advisory Boards</a> also continue to honor their commitment to arXiv, meeting with the new executive director, corresponding via email, and contributing their perspectives on operations and aspirations for 2020 and beyond.</p>
<p>Here at arXiv, our staff has been working remotely for several weeks now, like so many of our colleagues. And so it is from our home offices that, again, we thank our volunteers and share our gratitude for the strong arXiv community that remains connected during this difficult time. Thank you.</p>

<p>Saturn’s auroras may heat
its atmosphere like an electric toaster. </p>



<p>Measurements from NASA’s Cassini
spacecraft’s final orbits show that Saturn’s upper atmosphere <a href="https://nlcontent.springernature.com/d-redirect/TIDP482901X19CE7484E35A448AA0F50AF137F34D2AYI4/?url=https%3a%2f%2fnature.com%2farticles%2fs41550-020-1060-0&amp;linksource=https%3a%2f%2fnemo-web-feed-provider.live.cf.private.springer.com%2f15589138%2fpressReleases%2f%5bdossier-id%5d%3feditorialDomain%3dhttps%253A%252F%252Fpress.nature.com%26publicationDomain%3dhttps%253A%252F%252Fnature.com%252Farticles">is hottest where its auroras shine</a>, a finding that could help solve a long-standing
mystery about the outer planets.</p>



<p>Saturn’s upper atmosphere is much hotter than scientists first expected based on the planet’s distance from the sun. In fact, all the gas giant planets — Saturn, Jupiter, Uranus and Neptune — were thought to have chilly upper atmospheres around 150 kelvins (–123° Celsius). But data from the <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/nostalgic-voyager-documentary-relives-first-exploration-solar-system">Voyager spacecraft</a>, which flew past the outer planets in the 1970s and 1980s (<em>SN: 8/7/17</em>), showed a surprisingly toasty upper atmosphere of 400 to 600 kelvins (125° C to 325° C) on Saturn, and even higher temperatures on Jupiter and Neptune. </p>



<p>Planetary scientists dub this
mismatch an “energy crisis.” Something injects extra energy into the gas
giants’ atmospheres, but no one knew what. “Trying to explain why these
temperatures are so high has long been a goal in planetary atmospheric
physics,” says planetary scientist Ron Vervack of Johns Hopkins University’s
Applied Physics Laboratory.</p>





<p>Data from the Cassini
spacecraft’s waning weeks might point to an answer, planetary scientist Zarah
Brown of the University of Arizona in Tucson and colleagues report April 6 in
<em>Nature Astronomy</em>. </p>



<p>After orbiting Saturn for 13
years, Cassini finished its mission with a daredevil series of dips between the
planet and its rings before <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/rip-cassini-saturn-nasa">plunging into Saturn’s atmosphere</a> in September 2017 (<em>SN: 9/15/17</em>). During those
final orbits, the spacecraft probed the planet’s upper atmosphere by watching stars
in the background. Measuring the amount of starlight that the atmosphere blocks
told Brown and colleagues how dense the atmosphere is at different points, a
clue to its temperatures.</p>



<p>Using 30 of these stellar
measurements, 22 of which came from the last six weeks of Cassini’s mission,
the team mapped Saturn’s atmospheric temperatures across the whole planet and
at different depths. “For the outer planets, this is an unprecedented data
set,” says planetary scientist Tommi Koskinen, also of the University of
Arizona.</p>



<p>The atmosphere was hottest around
60° N and 60° S latitudes — roughly
where <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/spying-saturns-light-show-anomalous-aurora-dazzles-scientists">Saturn’s glowing auroras show up</a> (<em>SN: 2/16/05</em>). Auroras are brilliant lights
that sparkle when charged particles from the sun interact with a planet’s
magnetosphere, the region defined by a planet’s magnetic field. Unlike Earth’s
visible auroras, Saturn’s auroras glow mainly in ultraviolet light. </p>



<p>The auroras’ light doesn’t
emit much heat on its own, but is accompanied by electric currents that can generate
heat like the wires in a toaster. This process, called Joule heating, also
happens in Earth’s atmosphere.</p>



<p>If Jupiter, Uranus and
Neptune’s auroras also coincide with extra heat, then auroras may solve the
mystery of hot atmospheres across the solar system. The same process could even
take place on exoplanets, Brown says. </p>



<p>Vervack, who has worked with
the Voyager dataset but was not involved in the new work, thinks this study
marks “a big step in our understanding” of these hot upper atmospheres.</p>



<p>“The real test of whether
they’re right will be when you go out to Uranus or Neptune,” whose magnetospheres
are more complicated than Saturn’s, he says. “Being able to see how our
understanding from Saturn holds up when we get to these more complicated systems
is going to be really key to knowing if we’ve licked this problem or not.” </p>

                <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/algae-use-flagella-trot-gallop-move-gaits-all-their-own">Algae use flagella to trot, gallop and move with gaits all their own</a></h4>

<p>A microscopic speck of green algae can
trot like a horse. Or gallop. Biophysicist Kirsty Wan  compares the gaits of creatures large and
small.  </p>



<p>Moving diagonally opposite limbs, or flagella
in this case, in unison —
that’s a trot, Wan says. Her lab, at the University of Exeter in England, is
working on the conundrum of how single-celled creatures, with no nervous system
or brain, coordinate “limbs” to create various gaits. Some of those movements
get far trickier than trots and gallops. </p>



<p>Her work echoes that of 19th century
photographer Eadweard Muybridge, who used a then-novel imaging technique to
reveal hoof positions obscured in the blur of a horse galloping. Wan now creates
Muybridge moments for <a href="https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rstb.2019.0393">microalgae</a>.
Using a range of microscopy analytics on what she calls “my private collection
of weird algae,” Wan and colleagues have documented microalgae that coordinate from
four to 16 flagella. </p>



<p>In some four-limbed cells, flagella can move
in neighborly pairs, pulling back in a sort of double-vision breaststroke. To
these microscopic critters, water feels thicker than the splashy stuff that giant
humans easily swish aside. So the algal breaststroke has little glide. It’s more
like a slog through molasses.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed-youtube wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">

</div>This single-celled alga activates its four flagella in the pattern used by a galloping horse. Then something not obvious to a human startles the alga (<em>Carteria crucifera</em>) into retreat. The cell pulls itself together though, and presses on. </figure>



<p>Wan looked hard for microalgae with
eight flagella and found three species. One, <em>Pyramimonus octopus</em>, has a gait unlike any Muybridge ever saw. Wan
calls it rotary breaststroke. Flagella across from each other in the array of eight
will curl in for the stroke as their neighbors are uncurling a few beats behind.</p>





<p><em>P.
octopus</em> is a twitchy microbe that
goes through “shocks,” Wan says. An alga swims along, then “like a knee-jerk
reaction,” it changes direction, though she can’t see what spooks it. In
comparison, when she watches a two-flagella <em>Chlamydomonas</em>
species, “sometimes it twirls; sometimes it spins,” but there’s nothing so dramatic
as the abrupt pullback.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed-youtube wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">

</div> The single-celled Arctic alga <em>Pyramimonus octopus</em> coordinates eight flagella when it swims. Even when tethered in place, the cell’s opposite pairs curl and uncurl in what biophysicist Kirsty Wan, of the University of Exeter in England, calls a rotary breaststroke.   </figure>



<p>The trickiest example she’s seen may have been lost to science. Wan once grew the Arctic’s <em>P. cyrtoptera</em>, the only microalgal species she knows of with an array of 16 flagella. Sometimes opposite pairs of flagella stroke in unison as the motion ripples around and around the array in a gait she calls a “wave.” Her colony died, however, and so did her supplier’s. “I hope it still exists somewhere in the world,” she says. “Otherwise, I might have … taken the last footage.”</p>

                <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/quantum-mechanics-some-black-hole-orbits-impossible-predict">Quantum mechanics means some black hole orbits are impossible to predict</a></h4>

<p>Even if you could measure three black
holes’ locations as precisely as physically possible, you still might not know
where the black holes would go. Such a trio’s complex dance can be so chaotic
that the motions are fundamentally unpredictable, new computer simulations
show. </p>



<p>The paths of three black holes orbiting each other can be calculated based on their positions and velocities at one point in time. But in some cases, the orbits depend so sensitively on the black holes’ exact positions that the uncertainty of quantum physics comes into play. Tiny quantum uncertainties in specifying the locations of objects can explode as the black holes’ gyrations continue over tens of millions of years, astrophysicist Tjarda Boekholt and colleagues report in the April <em>Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society</em>.<a href="https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article-abstract/493/3/3932/5736044?redirectedFrom=fulltext"> So the distant future of the black holes’ orbits is impossible to foresee</a>.</p>



<p>Such extreme sensitivity to initial conditions is known as chaos. The new study suggests, in the case of three black holes, “quantum mechanics imprints into the universe chaos at a fundamental level,” says astrophysicist Nathan Leigh of Universidad de Concepción in Chile, who was not involved with the research.</p>



<p>In chaotic systems, tiny changes can generate
wildly different outcomes. The classic example is a <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/born-half-century-ago-chaos-theory-languished-years">butterfly flapping its wings</a>, thereby altering weather patterns, possibly
producing a distant tornado that otherwise wouldn’t have formed (<em>SN: 9/16/13</em>). This chaos also shows up
in the orbits of three black holes and other collections of three or more objects,
making such orbits difficult to calculate, a conundrum known as the three-body
problem.</p>





<p>To test whether the black holes’ motions
were predictable, Boekholt, of the University of Coimbra in Portugal, and
colleagues checked if they could run computer simulations of the orbits both
forward and backward and achieve the same result. Starting with a given set of
locations for three initially stationary black holes, the researchers evolved
those orbits forward in time to an end point tens of millions of years in the
future. Then, they rewound the simulation, reversing the motions to see if the
black holes ended up where they started from. </p>



<p>Computer simulations have a limited level
of accuracy. In this case, for example, the locations of black holes were known
only to a certain number of decimal places. That tiny imprecision can balloon
over millions of years of the simulation. </p>



<p>According to quantum mechanics, it is
impossible to determine the position of any object better than an utterly tiny
distance called the <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/out-fabric">Planck length</a>, about 1.6
times 10<sup>-35</sup> meters, or 16 billionths of a trillionth of a trillionth
of a millimeter (<em>SN: 4/8/11</em>). Yet even
with accuracy the size of the Planck length, the researchers found that about 5
percent of the time the three black holes wouldn’t return to the same spots
when the simulation was reversed. That means, even if you measured where the black
holes were to the quantum mechanical limit, you couldn’t rewind to find out
where they had come from. </p>



<p>“These systems are fundamentally
irreversible,” says Boekholt. “You can’t go forwards and backwards for these 5 percent
of systems in nature. And that was quite a surprising result.”</p>



<p>The result is theoretical and can’t be applied to real black holes, says astrophysicist Nicholas Stone of the Hebrew University of Jerusalem. For example, measurement errors would swamp the importance of quantum physics. But that doesn’t detract from the study’s importance, he says: “It is still quite interesting from a conceptual perspective.”</p>

<p><em>By </em><a href="http://emilyoliviareynolds.com/">Emily Reynolds</a></p>
<p>Ensuring you’re well-informed before making a choice is, on the whole, a sensible thing to do. This is especially true of big decisions — just pretending you’ve read the terms and conditions of a new website might be okay, but we’re unlikely to be so lax about our health or finances.</p>
<p>But could too <em>much</em> information lead us to make worse, not better, decisions? A study published in <a href="https://cognitiveresearchjournal.springeropen.com/articles/10.1186/s41235-020-0206-z"><em>Cognitive Research: Principles and Implications</em></a> suggests that sometimes that might be the case.</p>
<p><span id="more-39433"></span>Min Zheng and colleagues were motivated by advances in machine learning that have increased the information available to feed into decision-making, particularly when it comes to models of cause and effect: these algorithms can reveal potential outcomes likely to happen from certain actions or inputs.</p>
<p>But when it comes to human decision-making, it’s unclear how useful such information is. Simply presenting causal information to people may not actually help them make decisions: as senior author <a href="https://www.stevens.edu/news/turns-out-there-such-thing-tmi-more-information-doesnt-necessarily-help-people-make-better">Samantha Kleinberg says</a>, “being accurate is not enough for information to be useful”. In particular, we don’t know how this information might interact with the knowledge and beliefs people already have.</p>
<p>An initial experiment tested how causal information influences the kinds of decisions we make in everyday life. The team presented 1,718 participants with a real world scenario and asked them to give advice on how they would approach it. Participants were told that Jane, a university fresher, wanted to avoid putting on weight but continue to have fun with her friends, and were asked what one thing she should do to achieve her goal: go for a half hour walk every weekend, maintain a healthy diet, avoid seeing her friends, or watch less TV.</p>
<p>A third of the participants were given no extra information to help them answer the question, another third were given a text-based causal explanation of the impact of diet and regular exercise on weight loss, and the final third were given a simple causal diagram. Those in the latter two categories were also asked whether the causal explanations had been helpful or affected their answer.</p>

<p>Those in the no-information condition were highly accurate: 88.8% picked the correct answer (i.e. that Jane should maintain a healthy diet). But those in the two conditions provided with causal information performed <em>worse: </em>82.7% got the correct answer with the text-based explanation, and 80.1% with the diagram.</p>
<p>The second experiment followed a similar method, except in this case the scenario was one that only some participants would have experience dealing with: the management of type 2 diabetes. Participants were asked whether it would be best for someone with diabetes to manage their condition through behaving as normal, through walking more, or by choosing a healthier dinner and going cycling. They were either given no information or a diagram showing the impact of exercise and healthy eating.</p>
<p>When no causal information was given, participants with and without type 2 diabetes chose the right answer (i.e. choosing a healthy meal and going for a bike ride) at about the same rate. Additional causal information was useful for those without personal experience of diabetes, increasing accuracy to 86.6% — but when the type 2 diabetes group were given causal information, accuracy dropped to just 50%.</p>
<p>This, along with the results from the first experiment, suggests that causal diagrams themselves are not inherently useless: rather, their ability to improve our decision-making depends on our personal experience. When a situation is new to us, we can benefit from causal information, but when we are already familiar with it, this information can actually lead us to making worse decisions.</p>
<p>The team thinks this has something to do with our existing mental models. We don’t take causal information at face value, but instead our existing beliefs and experience influence our decisions. This can sometimes mean we don’t make the right choice: with extra information we can lose confidence and start second-guessing ourselves.</p>
<p>A final experiment confirmed these findings: when participants had personal experience with a topic, causal information reduced their accuracy, but in made-up scenarios, such as a question on alien mind reading, participants were able to use causal information to make accurate choices. “In situations where people do not have background knowledge, they become more confident with the new information and make better decisions,” says Kleinberg.</p>
<p>That doesn’t mean that information uncovered by machine learning isn’t valuable — quite the contrary. But understanding what people already believe, and tailoring information to that, may be the best way to communicate it.</p>

<h4>Come together</h4>



<p><em>Climate change is altering the world at an increasing pace, transforming ecosystems and harming indigenous communities. Scientists observing these changes are frustrated and grieving, </em><strong><em><strong><em>Jonathan Lambert</em></strong></em></strong><em> reported in “<a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/scientists-grief-climate-change-warming-mental-health-ecology">When grief comes with the job</a>” (</em>SN: 2/29/20, p. 22<em>).</em></p>



<p>Readers were moved by the story and many shared their experiences observing ecological changes in their own backyards.</p>



<p>“I live at a lake that is maintained by natural springs and I’ve been there all my life,” reader <strong>Rhonda Embelton</strong> wrote. “My heart breaks for my beloved lake. Frogs declining, I don’t see bats anymore, I could go on and on. Young people don’t miss what they don’t see, so I feel that I have a responsibility to do what I can, as little as that may be! Thank you, to all scientists [who] work hard to reverse and bring awareness to everyone.”</p>





<p><strong>Lambert</strong><strong>’</strong><strong>s</strong> story brought reader <strong>Rebecca Hepburn</strong> to tears. “I’m no environmentalist, but there are less and less birds in my yard, my neighbors poison the earth to make their yards look better and the fertilizers and pesticides roll into our yard,” <strong>Hepburn </strong>wrote. “Anyway, thank you for this. It makes me feel a little less crazy.”</p>



<p><strong>Patric Hedlund</strong>, a managing editor at a small California newspaper, detailed his experience diving among coral reefs. “I am familiar with the distress that can be overwhelming at times to see the impact on nature of human choices,” <strong>Hedlund </strong>wrote. “As writers and journalists, we try to articulate the … dread, in hope that our words can … mobilize others to take effective action. But human change is glacial, while warming is accelerating exponentially,” he wrote. “Hope is a resource that can be self-regenerating by action or depleted by stubbornly resistant systems and attitudes. The children get it. They hold the seeds of hope that will fuel the urgency that is needed now. But they need all of us — and all our higher-order institutions — to … make this a priority.”</p>





<h4>COVID-19 Q&amp;A</h4>



<p>Science News<em> reporters </em><strong><em><strong><em>Tina Hesman Saey</em></strong></em></strong><em>, </em><strong><em><strong><em>Aimee Cunningham</em></strong></em></strong><em>, </em><strong><em><strong><em>Jonathan Lambert </em></strong></em></strong><em>and </em><strong><em><strong><em>Erin Garcia de Jesus</em></strong></em></strong><em> are working hard to keep you up to date on the coronavirus pandemic. As cases rise, the team is answering reader questions about COVID-19. </em><em></em></p>



<p>“Why are people in such a tizzy about it?” reader <strong>Joe B</strong>. asked. “With regard to numbers killed, influenza in the U.S. alone far surpasses it. It just seems like the level of concern is disproportionate to the actual threat.”</p>



<p>COVID-19 is many times deadlier than the flu. Like the flu, this virus seems to hit older people hard. Unlike the flu, there isn’t yet a vaccine. And because this virus is new, no one has developed immunity against it. That means everyone is susceptible to get-ting infected and transmitting the virus to others, so it can spread rapidly and widely. If numbers of U.S. cases continue to rise rapidly, like in other countries, COVID-19 patients could have to compete with other sick people for hospital space. Too big a spike could overwhelm hospitals.</p>



<p>Scientists worry that the virus could take hold in the United States, causing yearly epidemics like the flu, which killed about 34,000 Americans during the 2018–2019 season. That means we would have another serious respiratory disease to deal with regularly.</p>



<p>Reader <strong>Ken M</strong>. asked if there are two strains of the coronavirus, one that causes mild symptoms and another that has more severe effects. </p>



<p>There are not two strains of the virus going around in the United States or elsewhere. A study published online March 3 in the <em>National Science Review </em>claimed there were two types of the virus infecting people. One of the supposed types had a particular mutation. This type was more prevalent in Wuhan, China, in the early stages of the outbreak and produced more severe symptoms, researchers suggested. But that mutation doesn’t change the virus’s proteins and probably has no effect on disease severity, other experts say.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/620767382/0/oupblogpsychology/">The surprising scientific value of national bias</a></h4>

<p>Emotions seem by their very nature to defy scientific analysis. Private and evanescent, and yet powerful and determining, feelings resist systematic observation and measurement. We are lucky to catch a glimpse in a facial expression or inflection of speech. The emotions of animals are all the more difficult. Without words to communicate what might be in their minds or on their nerves, animals–ranging from the complex to the simple–remain nearly a closed emotional book for even the cleverest experiment. A century ago Robert Yerkes, then at Harvard, registered these frustrations. Little is “of more obvious importance scientifically than affection,” he wrote in his <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://archive.org/details/introductiontop03yerkgoog/page/n7/mode/2up">Introduction to Psychology</a>, in 1911, but its study lags behind investigation of “cognitive consciousness.” Convenient as it might be to assume animals are machinelike anyway, our behavior in the laboratory, he observed earlier in his <em>Journal of Comparative Neurology and Psychology</em> in 1906, betrays our logic. “Even those who claim that animals are automata do not treat them as such.”</p><p>Shrewd as Yerkes was about his specialty of animal behavior, he would have been puzzled by the idea that national loyalty influenced his science. His research ethos was empiricism: Infer conclusions from carefully collected facts. As he succinctly advised in 1904 in the same journal, “experiment much and speculate little.” Other Americans agreed. John B. Watson’s “<a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://www.all-about-psychology.com/psychology-as-the-behaviorist-views-it.html">Psychology as the Behaviorist Views It</a>” of 1913 proposed to make the field “purely objective” by jettisoning the “yoke of consciousness.” That a conscious mind exists at all, in Watson’s view, was mere supposition. It makes sense that it was the German-born émigré ornithologist, Ernst Mayr, who recognized the American devotion to practicality as a national bias. When his Dutch friend, Niko Tinbergen, planned lectures for a US tour in 1946, Mayr wrote to him that “American scientists do not care for too much speculation but like thorough analysis of observed phenomena.” Indeed, deficient experimentation and excessive theorizing became a polemical weapon in international debate. Intellectual precision was–and is–the mark of good science, but American investigators of animal sensibility once claimed it as their special national possession.</p><p>Although the danger of scientific myopia nurtured by pride is obvious, these Americans’ faith in their superior practice ironically became a path forward toward internationalism. Their zeal for conducting animal behavior experiments produced real insights into affective experience. They had something to contribute abroad. In the process, they traveled the world for fieldwork, made far-flung professional acquaintances, and opened the door to refugee scientists displaced by the twentieth century’s political turmoil. Scientific passion stoked nationalism, but also gradually undermined it.</p><figure><img height="354" src="https://blog.oup.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Racoon-180x105.jpg" width="607" />Researcher L.W. Cole works with a raccoon, 1905. Used with permission from Yale Library.</figure><p>Animal experiments became one area of American expertise. Nonhuman subjects, by their very lack of language and inability to deceive in self-reports, were a perfect fit for a method based on external observation. The variety of species studied included the proverbial white rat, but many others as well. Although Yerkes spent three decades after World War I focused on primates, he had earlier measured learning in newts, frogs, mice, crows, and pigs. His colleague Edward Thorndike watched chicks, cats, and dogs escape from puzzle boxes, and Yerkes’s student L. W. Cole did the same with raccoons. So much scrutiny of animals expanded the researchers’ appreciation of their personalities. Intelligence, understood as skill acquisition, was the original question. Mood and temperament were annoyances. A tired rat knew where to find the bit of bread, but stopped running for it. It is not surprising that the emotions themselves eventually caught scientific interest. Donald Griffin rattled his field in <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://books.rupress.org/catalog/book/question-animal-awareness"><em>The Question of Animal Awareness</em></a> of 1976 when he declared, against reigning local wisdom, that animals are conscious. They have “not only images and intentions, but also feelings, desires, hopes, fears.” His revolutionary claim was the endpoint, however, of a typical American career. Three decades before, Griffin discovered how bats maneuver in the dark by echolocation, a kind of intelligence. His wonder at the animal mind deepened over the years.</p><p>To be sure, American scientists never had a monopoly on insight into animal behavior. The counterexample of Darwin is enough to deflate any sense of supremacy. Their enthusiasm for controlled animal experiments produced so many competent studies, however, that they may have had an outsized influence. One British book of 1915, <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~assets.cambridge.org/97811076/26560/excerpt/9781107626560_excerpt.pdf"><em>Investigation of Mind in Animals</em></a> by E. M. Smith, borrowed nearly all of its illustrations from American publications. Although the Americans favored laboratory work for its rigor, they increasingly went into the field to witness the vast number of species in native habitats. Yerkes traveled to Senegal in 1929 in pursuit of great apes, and Griffin to Venezuela in 1952 to observe the nocturnal navigation of oilbirds. Often welcomed as respected authorities, they were also exposed to the world’s problems. Walter Cannon of Harvard celebrated “free intellectual intercourse without respect to national boundaries” in his plenary speech at the International Physiological Congress in Leningrad in 1935, published by the state press as <em>Chemical Transmission of Nerve Impulses</em>. His trip by train from Vladivostok to reach the meeting, however, was a sobering political lesson. Seeing prisoners laboring at gunpoint along the tracks in Siberia made for “a queer kind of horror that seizes you now and then,” his wife Cornelia wrote of the trip. Cannon may well not have had immediate doubts about the virtues of his own country, but he surely registered the pressures of nationalism at the borders of science.</p><figure><img height="398" src="https://blog.oup.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Scientist-180x122.jpg" width="587" />Scientist C. R. Carpenter setting up equipment in Thailand in 1937 to record gibbon calls. Used with permission from Penn State Library.</figure><p>World War II fully exposed the catastrophic cost of national arrogance. International science advanced in its wake. Supported by American colleagues, Mayr achieved US citizenship in 1950 after a decade of government surveillance as a suspect alien. Although the new politics of internationalism was influential, just as crucial was the internal dynamic of science to push its practitioners beyond parochialism. The same high standard that impelled these Americans to apprehend animals in all their complexity–including animal emotions–underwrote growing internationalism. Precisely because the American science of animal behavior was embedded in political life, it had the power to change minds.</p><p><em>Featured image from <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://pixabay.com/photos/gorilla-monkey-animal-zoo-furry-3606809/">Pixabay</a>.</em></p><p>The post <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://blog.oup.com/2020/04/the-surprising-scientific-value-of-national-bias/">The surprising scientific value of national bias</a> appeared first on <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://blog.oup.com">OUPblog</a>.</p><img align="left" border="0" height="1" hspace="0" src="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/i/620767382/0/oupblogpsychology" style="border: 0; float: left; margin: 0; padding: 0; width: 1px!important; height: 1px!important;" width="1" /><div style="clear: both; padding-top: 0.2em;"><a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/2/620767382/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/fbshare20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/28/620767382/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/fblike20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/30/620767382/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/googleplus20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/16/620767382/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/linkedin20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/29/620767382/oupblogpsychology,https%3a%2f%2fblog.oup.com%2fwp-content%2fuploads%2f2020%2f03%2fRacoon-180x105.jpg"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/pinterest20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/1/620767382/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/reddit20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/24/620767382/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/twitter20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/19/620767382/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/email20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/20/620767382/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/rss20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a><h3 style="clear: left; padding-top: 10px;">Related Stories</h3><ul><li><a href="https://blog.oup.com/2020/04/why-we-like-a-good-robot-story-2/" rel="nofollow">Why we like a good robot story</a></li><li><a href="https://blog.oup.com/2020/04/untold-stories-of-the-apollo-13-engineers/" rel="nofollow">Untold stories of the Apollo 13 engineers</a></li><li><a href="https://blog.oup.com/2020/03/how-we-can-equip-ourselves-against-climate-change/" rel="nofollow">How we can equip ourselves against climate change</a></li></ul> </div>

<p><em>Our weekly round-up of the best psychology coverage from elsewhere on the web</em></p>
<p><strong>Psycholinguists have taken a scientific approach to the creation of new swear words, </strong><a href="https://www.discovermagazine.com/mind/building-the-perfect-profanity">reports Neuroskeptic</a> at <em>Discover Magazine</em>. Researchers identified the ideal words to pair with profanities in order to come up with colourful new insults. Sticking <em>-pig</em> or <em>-mouth</em> to the end of your favoured swear word will probably have the desired effect, according to the work, while adding <em>-newspaper</em> or <em>-fireplace</em> could leave your insult falling flat.</p>

<p><strong>The sense of smell is arguably the least appreciated of all our senses</strong>.

<p><strong>There are two kinds of bird that make their home in cities: big-brained birds that have few offspring, and small-brained ones that breed often. </strong>That’s according to a recent study <a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/podcast/episode/city-birds-big-brained-with-few-offspring-or-small-brained-with-a-lot/">covered in a podcast</a> from <em>Scientific American</em>. Birds with more brain power have an advantage when it comes to finding food and avoiding dangers. But for those with small brains, <span>like pigeons,</span><span> producing plenty of offspring means that the population can still survive even if some individuals die.</span></p>

<p>There’s a lot of interesting statistics you can do by scraping websites, whether it’s reading tables from Wikipedia, grabbing and aggregating climate change tables from government websites, or quantifying the exponential growth of covid-19 articles on Medium. Many of these pages will have easy-to-use methods to download the data in a develop-friendly format, for example CSV or JSON. For others, you’ll have to rely on scraping web pages, an ancient, dark art. In this article, I’ll introduce you to some of the tools of the trade to do so in Python.</p>



<h2>Identifying targets with developer tools</h2>



<p>Both Chrome and Firefox have developer tools (Shortcut: Ctrl+Shift+I). These tools allow you:</p>



<ul><li>Visualize the HTML, JavaScript, and CSS behind a webpage</li><li>See the traffic between your browser and the internet, include late http requests triggered by JavaScript</li><li>Execute custom JavaScript that can read and modify the DOM of a webpage</li><li>Identify where a particular UI element is created in the page’s HTML</li></ul>



<p>These can help you identify which part of a page you need to scrape. Let’s say, for instance, that we want to find out how the top article of a major news website changes as a function of time during a time of crisis (as of now, covid-19). Perhaps we’ll want to retroactively run an analysis of the sentiment behind the headline, the focus (health, business, etc.), the frequency of updates, or of how these headers co-vary with numbers released by different governments.</p>



<p>Here I’ll use the New York Times as the example webpage. What we’d like is to grab, every half-hour, the title of the biggest headline. With developer tools, I can easily use the Picker tool (Ctrl+Shift+C) to highlight the biggest headline on the page.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="" class="wp-image-7487" data-attachment-id="7487" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-description="" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="scraping" data-large-file="https://xcorr.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/scraping.png?w=723" data-medium-file="https://xcorr.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/scraping.png?w=300" data-orig-file="https://xcorr.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/scraping.png" data-orig-size="3070,1752" data-permalink="https://xcorr.net/scraping/" src="https://xcorr.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/scraping.png?w=1024" /></figure>



<p>Here I find that the biggest headline is a <code>span</code> with a class name of <code>balancedHeadline</code>. Let’s look at how we can grab this information with Selenium.</p>



<h2>Selenium: remote control browsers</h2>



<p><a href="https://www.selenium.dev/">The method I’ll showcase here uses Selenium</a>: we use a headless browser (that is, an instance of Firefox or Chrome that’s running “invisibly”) that navigates to the website we care about. Once on the webpage, we can inject javascript, simulate clicks or manipulate the DOM to get to the information we need. This is a rather heavyweight solution compared to, say, using <code><a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/urllib.html">urllib</a></code> to grab the data and parsing it with <code><a href="https://pypi.org/project/beautifulsoup4/">BeautifulSoup</a></code>. However, the big advantage we get is that the headless browser actually runs the javascript on the page and loads all the extra assets – it’s literally like a person navigating to the website. Sometimes, it can be the only solution, especially if the information we need:</p>



<ul><li>is dynamically loaded</li><li>is hidden behind authentication layers</li><li>requires emulating clicks and interacting with JavaScript</li></ul>



<p>In Python, we can easily install Selenium with:`</p>



<pre class="wp-block-preformatted">pip install selenium</pre>



<p>Then we’ll need to install a WebDriver – this will allow your favorite web browser to be manipulated via Python. Here I installed the Firefox webdriver on the Ubuntu platform. <a href="https://selenium-python.readthedocs.io/installation.html">I followed the instructions here on the Selenium website,</a> <a href="https://github.com/mozilla/geckodriver/releases">downloading the gecko webdriver</a> and extracting the binary to <code>/usr/bin</code>. You can check that you’ve done the installation by running a tiny bit of Python:</p>


<pre class="brush: python; title: ; notranslate">from selenium import webdriver

driver = webdriver.Firefox()
driver.get('https://nytimes.com/')

</pre>


<p>Running this code opens up Firefox and navigates to the website. Notice the unusual appearance of the browser: the url bar is a different color than usual, and there’s a robot icon next to the address.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large is-style-default"><img alt="" class="wp-image-7477" data-attachment-id="7477" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-description="" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="nytimes-robot" data-large-file="https://xcorr.files.wordpress.com/2020/03/nytimes-robot-e1585845303421.png?w=723" data-medium-file="https://xcorr.files.wordpress.com/2020/03/nytimes-robot-e1585845303421.png?w=300" data-orig-file="https://xcorr.files.wordpress.com/2020/03/nytimes-robot-e1585845303421.png" data-orig-size="2176,192" data-permalink="https://xcorr.net/nytimes-robot/" src="https://xcorr.files.wordpress.com/2020/03/nytimes-robot-e1585845303421.png?w=723" />A remote-controlled version of Firefox</figure>



<p>We can grab the information in at least a couple of ways: </p>



<ul><li>We could inject some Javascript into the page and use   <code>document.querySelectorAll("span.balancedHeadline")</code> to grab the headline</li><li>We could read the DOM to find the right span</li></ul>



<p>Let’s use the second method:</p>


<pre class="brush: python; title: ; notranslate">from selenium import webdriver
from selenium.webdriver.common.by import By
from selenium.webdriver.support.ui import WebDriverWait
from selenium.webdriver.support import expected_conditions as EC

driver = webdriver.Firefox()
driver.get('https://nytimes.com/')
element = WebDriverWait(driver, 10).until(
    EC.presence_of_element_located((By.CLASS_NAME, "balancedHeadline"))
)
print(element.text)
driver.quit()
</pre>


<h2>Running headless and automating</h2>



<p>Although the explicit window is useful for debugging, if you want to run this script every half-hour, you’ll want to run this in a headless browser. A headless browser doesn’t display a window, so it won’t pop up over your other windowsand capture your inputs. In addition, we’ll want to save the data to disk, which we can easily accomplish like so:</p>


<pre class="brush: plain; title: ; notranslate">from selenium import webdriver
from selenium.webdriver.common.by import By
from selenium.webdriver.support.ui import WebDriverWait
from selenium.webdriver.support import expected_conditions as EC
from selenium.webdriver.firefox.options import Options

options = Options()
options.headless = True

driver = webdriver.Firefox(options=options)
driver.get('https://nytimes.com/')
element = WebDriverWait(driver, 10).until(
    EC.presence_of_element_located((By.CLASS_NAME, "balancedHeadline"))
)
with open('/home/pmin/Documents/headless-browser/top_news.txt', 'a') as f:
    f.write('"' + str(datetime.datetime.now()) + '","' + element.text + '"\n')
driver.quit()
</pre>


<h3>Cron job</h3>



<p>All that’s left now is to set up a cron job to run this script every 15 minutes. First, we’ll need a shell file. We could run python directly, but I installed selenium inside of a special conda environment called <code>headless-browser</code>, so my shell file activates this environment before, like so:</p>


<pre class="brush: bash; title: ; notranslate">#!/bin/bash
source /home/pmin/miniconda3/etc/profile.d/conda.sh &amp;&amp; \
conda activate headless-browser &amp;&amp; \
python /home/pmin/Documents/headless-browser/grab_headline.py
</pre>


<p>I saved this file as <code>/home/pmin/Documents/headless-browser/grab_headline.sh</code>. Running  <code>crontab -e</code>, I added an entry that looks like this:</p>


<pre class="brush: plain; title: ; notranslate"># m h  dom mon dow   command
*/15 * * * * /home/pmin/Documents/headless-browser/grab_headline.sh 2&gt;&amp;1 /var/log/grab-headline.log
</pre>


<p><a href="https://crontab.guru/">You can use this website</a> to figure out what incantations to give to cron for different schedules. I also captured any output or error into an error log. If you don’t want to have to leave your computer on all the time to do this, <a href="https://cloud.google.com/scheduler/docs/creating">you can run cron jobs inside of a cloud service</a> instead.</p>



<h2>Authentication</h2>



<p>A final tweak we’ll need to deal with is authenticating. Sometimes the website we’re trying to scrape requires us to be logged in. It’s possible for the headless browser to use the same cookies and credentials as the regular browser you use. To do so, you need to locate the name of the default profile in Firefox. Locate a directory that finished with <code>.default</code> with:</p>


<pre class="brush: plain; title: ; notranslate">ls ~/.mozilla/firefox/
</pre>


<p>In my case, I found a directory called <code>lasd74g9.default</code>. Putting everything together, here’s my final script:</p>


<pre class="brush: python; title: ; notranslate">import datetime

from selenium import webdriver
from selenium.webdriver.common.by import By
from selenium.webdriver.support.ui import WebDriverWait
from selenium.webdriver.support import expected_conditions as EC
from selenium.webdriver.firefox.options import Options

options = Options()
options.headless = True

profile = profile = webdriver.FirefoxProfile(profile_directory='/home/pmin/.mozilla/firefox/lasd74g9.default')
driver = webdriver.Firefox(firefox_profile=profile, options=options)
driver.get('https://nytimes.com/')
element = WebDriverWait(driver, 10).until(
    EC.presence_of_element_located((By.CLASS_NAME, "balancedHeadline"))
)
with open('/home/pmin/Documents/headless-browser/grim_news.txt', 'a') as f:
    f.write('"' + str(datetime.datetime.now()) + '","' + element.text + '"\n')
driver.quit()

</pre>

<p><i>By</i> <a href="https://emmayoung.net/">Emma Young</a></p>
<p>Imagine going to sit in a room with a violent, imprisoned psychopath and having a chat about what you both like to eat. (It’s impossible not to think of liver, fava beans and Chianti, isn’t it….?)</p>
<p>This is exactly what one researcher did recently in Germany. But the purpose of <a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2020-17706-001">the study</a>, reported in <em>Personality Disorders: Theory, Research, and Treatment</em> wasn’t to gather data on criminal psychopaths’ dining preferences, but rather on how they make — or don’t make — eye contact during a conversation.</p>
<p>This was the first study to explore psychopaths’ eye movements in a naturalistic setting. And it reveals that prisoners who scored highly on one aspect of psychopathy, in particular, were much less likely to look at the interviewer’s eyes. This finding not only helps with understanding how psychopathy develops, but also suggests that finding ways to encourage at-risk children to make more eye contact might be a useful intervention, argue Nina Gehrer at the University of Tübingen and her colleagues.</p>
<p><span id="more-39418"></span>The team studied 30 men who had been convicted of serious crimes (including murder, rape and hostage-taking) and who were incarcerated in two institutions in Germany.</p>
<p>One researcher led all the interactions, which were divided into talking and listening stages. For one minute, the participant listened while the researcher talked about one of three neutral topics (eating habits/food, job/work or typical daily routine). Then, after a brief exchange on the topic, the second stage began: the participant talked for about a minute on the same topic. This was then repeated for the other two topics.</p>
<p>Throughout both stages, the experimenter maintained eye contact (this was later verified by two independent raters). And at all times, the prisoner wore an eye-tracking headset. This allowed the team to monitor where they were looking while they were listening and talking.</p>
<p>For the purposes of the study, the team divided the face into two sections: the eyes and the philtrum (the nose and mouth region). They then examined whether time spent looking at the eyes or philtrum correlated with the participants’ scores on the PCL-R, a standard psychopathy assessment.</p>
<p>Psychopathy is generally thought to have four facets, or components: manipulating other people, affective impairments (deficits in feeling emotion and empathy and in showing remorse or guilt), having an erratic lifestyle and demonstrating antisocial behaviour. Each of these is measured within the PCL-R. And the team found that during both listening and talking, prisoners with higher affective psychopathy scores made less eye contact. “These results are in line with previous research suggesting impaired attention to social cues in psychopathy,” the researchers write.</p>
<p>Current theories about how psychopathy develops assume that a failure to view important social cues (from the eyes, especially) is a key factor. For children who go on to be diagnosed with psychopathy, there’s evidence that emotion-related impairments emerge early, in the form of callous unemotional traits. There’s some evidence that young children who pay less attention to other people’s eyes are more likely to develop these traits, the researchers note. Now that this link has been found for adult, criminal psychopaths, this suggests that eye contact, or rather a lack of it, could be important for understanding the development of the disorder.</p>
<p>There are some limitations to the study, however. The number of participants was quite small, and all were men. The researchers themselves call for a replication before any firm conclusions can be drawn. It will also be important to investigate whether it’s possible to fix this particular deficit in eye contact, and, if so, whether that reduces the risk of developing emotion-related problems.</p>
<p>“To date, evidence for lasting changes in eye gaze through social attention bias modification training is still elusive,” they note. “Thus, these promising approaches and further opportunities that target impaired eye contact need to be further investigated and enhanced.”</p>

<img alt="" class="attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image" height="110" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2020/04/snack-140x110.jpg" style="display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;" width="140" /><p>Public health bodies have suggested that tobacco-style HWLs should be considered for application to alcohol and high calorie snack products. However, evidence for their potential usefulness in these contexts <a href="https://psyarxiv.com/jt52m/">is limited</a>, with prior research typically focusing on sugary drinks, or using smaller or less representative samples. This led us to run two large-scale studies in general populations to examine the potential effectiveness and acceptability of image-and-text HWLs on alcohol and snack foods.</p>
<p><strong>Our studies </strong></p>
<p>In two separate online studies we asked participants to rate different image-and-text HWLs on alcoholic drinks (Alcohol study, with 5,528 participants) and energy-dense snacks (Food study, with 4,618 participants). To take part, participants for the Alcohol study had to consume either beer or wine at least once a week, <img alt="" class="size-medium wp-image-11822 alignleft" height="300" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2020/04/alcohol-157x300.png" width="157" />and in the Food study participants consumed biscuits, cake, crisps or chocolate at least once a week, and liked chocolate.</p>
<p>Participants viewed and rated one of 21 image-and-text HWLs on alcoholic drinks or one of 18 image-and-text HWLs on high calorie snacks. Just like on cigarette packs, the HWLs showed an image of a disease relating to excess consumption of alcohol or high calorie snacks, alongside a text warning statement. For Alcohol the diseases depicted were bowel, breast, liver and non-specified cancers, heart disease, liver cirrhosis and liver disease, while for Food, the conditions were bowel and non-specified cancers, heart disease, obesity, and type 2 diabetes.</p>
<p>Participants were asked how afraid, worried, uncomfortable or disgusted the label made them feel, and to rate their desire to consume the labelled product. They were also asked how strongly they supported putting the HWL on alcoholic drinks or high calorie snacks.</p>
<p><strong>Results</strong></p>
<p><img alt="" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-11812" height="300" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2020/04/alcohol-200x300.jpg" width="200" />Alcohol study: we found that HWLs on alcoholic drinks depicting bowel cancer were associated with the highest level of negative emotional arousal and the lowest desire to consume the product. They were also considered the least acceptable for use by participants. In general, few of the alcohol HWLs were considered acceptable, with only three out of 21 rated at least somewhat acceptable.</p>
<p>Food study: HWLs on high-density snacks depicting bowel cancer, followed by those depicting non-specific cancer, were associated with the highest level of negative emotional arousal and lowest desire to consume the product, with those depicting bowel cancer again considered to be the least acceptable. HWLs on energy-dense snacks were judged on average more acceptable than those on alcohol, with 13 out of 18 snack HWLs rated as at least somewhat acceptable.</p>
<p><strong>Content analysis</strong></p>
<p>We also conducted a content analysis of free-text comments that some participants provided at the end of the study. Two key themes emerged– the acceptability of HWLs on these products, and their perceived effectiveness. Within these themes, comments touched on several pertinent issues, including the believability of the labels, whether people would avoid looking at them or become desensitized to them, whether they were appropriate to use, and whether participants thought they would affect their thoughts or behaviours in relation to these products.</p>
<p>Overall, while a wide range of views were expressed, the majority of responses expressed negative views of the possible use of such labels. It is plausible, however, that those who chose to leave a comment at the end of the study were those with more extreme opinions.</p>
<p><strong>Are our results surprising?</strong></p>
<p>In terms of potential effectiveness, we found that for both alcoholic drinks and high calorie snacks, HWLs describing bowel cancer evoked the strongest negative emotional reactions and resulted in the lowest desire to consume the product they were applied to. This is consistent with previous research on alcohol labeling which has found bowel-cancer HWLs to be particularly effective. It is notable that this is similarly the case in the context of snack foods, where to our knowledge these warnings have not been tested before.</p>
<blockquote><p>HWLs describing bowel cancer evoked the strongest negative emotional reactions</p></blockquote>
<p><img alt="" class="size-medium wp-image-11817 alignleft" height="200" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2020/04/choc-300x200.jpg" width="300" />The finding that HWLs may be judged to be relatively more acceptable to use on snack foods than on alcohol could appear surprising. This could be due to heightened public awareness of the health consequences of excess energy intake and obesity, particularly in children. The content analysis (albeit based on a small subset of participants) suggested a mainly negative reaction to these labels on these products. Again, this is perhaps not surprising given that the study sample were people who regularly consumed the target products, and interventions which affect us directly are usually less supported.</p>
<p><strong>Conclusions</strong></p>
<p>These results suggest that labels depicting bowel cancer may have the greatest potential for reducing alcohol and snack food selection and consumption. However, while bowel cancer HWLs had the greatest impact on people, they were also rated as the least acceptable.</p>
<p>This study could not, however, demonstrate whether these labels are likely effective in actually changing behavior. The studies did not include a measure of actual behavior, and there was no control group to compare against. The studies were also conducted online and responses may differ when HWLs are applied to physical products in real-world settings.</p>
<p>Further experimental studies are now needed to directly assess the potential effectiveness of health warning labels to reduce selection and consumption of <a href="https://psyarxiv.com/rv2p6/">alcohol</a> and <a href="https://psyarxiv.com/zyca2/">energy-dense snacks</a>. Studies in field and naturalistic laboratory settings will enable us to examine whether these labels are likely to be effective in real-world settings.</p>

The work challenges audiences to confront the technological, ethical, and societal questions raised by the advent of urban socially-aware robots.</p>
<p>The robotic artwork combines the way-finding technologies of delivery and maintenance robots with an ability to communicate non-verbally, and to manipulate our emotions through body-language. The robot is able to move around an exhibition space using a predefined map created using SLAM technology. It reacts and responds to the body language of audience members through a multi-layered face, skeleton and movement tracking algorithm.</p>
<p>The small and fragile humanoid form is dressed in the clothes of a worker, its frail and insignificant body reminds us of the social groups that will be most affected by future automation. The robot’s head and hands are made from 3D printed grey PLA and it intentionally avoids categorisations of race and gender. The project forces us to consider issues of ownership of public spaces as well as the broader ethical implications of how we design robots and behave towards them.</p>
<p>Cyberspecies Proximity is a project by Anna Dumitriu and Alex May, created in collaboration with the Human Robot Co-Mobility Project of the New Technologies Team at Schindler. The project was supported by a Vertigo STARTS Residency, and the artwork was programmed in C++ and FUGIO, the Open Source Visual Programming System created by Alex May.</p>

<p><em>By </em><a href="http://emilyoliviareynolds.com/">Emily Reynolds</a></p>
<p>No matter how high your <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2018/05/09/more-time-spent-abroad-increases-self-concept-clarity-confidence-in-and-clarity-about-who-you-are/">self-confidence</a>, it’s likely that you have certain traits you’d change given the opportunity: maybe you’d turn down your anxiety, feel more outgoing in company, or be a bit less lazy. One 2016 <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0146167216637840">study</a> found that 78% of people wanted to better embody at least one of the Big Five personality traits (extraversion, emotional stability, conscientiousness, agreeableness, or openness to experience), so the desire to change who you are is not uncommon.</p>
<p>But are we so keen to change how moral we are? That is, how concerned are we really about being a good or bad person? A new study <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0956797619893078?journalCode=pssa">published in </a><a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0956797619893078?journalCode=pssa"><em>Psychological Science</em></a> suggests that we’d rather spend time improving those parts of us that aren’t morally relevant, with traits like honesty, compassion and fairness taking a back seat.</p>
<p><span id="more-39410"></span>Jessie Sun from the University of California, Davis, and Geoffrey Goodwin from the University of Pennsylvania asked two groups comprising a total of 800 participants to fill in an online survey, in which they self-reported their personality traits. The first set of questions was based on the Big Five personality domains, while the second looked at moral traits, with questions measuring general morality as well as honesty, fairness, loyalty and purity. Participants also indicated how much they wanted to change on each of these personality and moral traits, responding to statements like “I want to be helpful and unselfish with others”, for example.</p>
<p>Participants also nominated four “informants” who knew them well. These informants rated their friend’s traits and reported what changes they’d like to see in the friend’s personality and moral character. Informants also selected the top three changes they’d like to see in their friend.</p>
<p>Participants most wanted to change their non-moral personality traits, particularly those relating to negative emotions: they wanted to reduce anxiety, depression, emotional volatility and anger. Creativity, productivity and sociability were the most desired traits, while moral traits such as honesty, loyalty and fairness took a back seat. And, overall, participants showed a weaker desire to change moral traits than non-morally relevant personality traits.</p>
<p>This preference was even more striking when the researchers considered the top three desired changes for each participant. In one of the groups, 48% of participants reported that becoming less anxious was one of their top three priorities, with 44% wanting to become less depressed. Desire for increased sociability and productivity, and reduced emotional volatility, also commonly made it to the top. But moral improvements were not prioritised: a desire to become more compassionate made the top three goals of just 9% of participants, and only 3% counted a goal to become more generally moral among their top priorities.</p>
<p>A similar pattern also emerged across the participants’ “informants”, who also expressed very little desire to change their friends’ moral traits and were likely to select goals that closely matched those picked by participants . The informants also wanted their friends to change less than the participants did themselves.</p>
<p>This pattern of results didn’t just come about because participants already saw themselves as particularly moral, the researchers argue. Instead, some of it may be down to self-interest: we’re more motivated to change in ways that improve our own sense of well-being, in other words. Being less depressed has an obvious and immediate impact on our lives; being “more moral” does not come with such straightforward benefits.</p>
<p>Although self-interest doesn’t sound like a particularly noble motivator, the fact that friends also seemed to prioritise the participants’ personal well-being is somewhat more cheering. The friends seemed to choose desired changes not by how “good” or “bad” they were likely to make the target, but by how likely they were to make their life better or happier.</p>
<p>Previous <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2017/11/29/belief-in-our-moral-superiority-is-the-most-irrational-self-enhancing-bias-of-all/">research</a> has also suggested a supreme confidence in our own moral superiority: we frequently believe we are more honest and trustworthy than others. In some cases, this may be true. But we could also benefit from thinking harder about our possession of these qualities when it’s time for self-improvement.</p>

It’s a bit like a slugger crediting Barry Bonds for help with his homerun swing. An anesthesiology journal has retracted a 2018 paper that cited three retracted papers by Yoshitaka Fujii, the record-holder for most retractions by a single author.  As we’ve written before, journals had a spotty record in reacting to the Fujii scandal, … <a class="more-link" href="https://retractionwatch.com/2020/04/01/zombie-papers-why-do-papers-by-the-most-prolific-fraudster-in-history-keep-getting-cited/">Continue reading <span class="screen-reader-text">Zombie papers: Why do papers by the most prolific fraudster in history keep getting cited?</span></a>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">From its launch in 2003, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">PLOS Biology</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> quickly established itself as PLOS’ flagship journal in the life sciences–a model of Open Access and a catalyst for change in scholarly publishing as well as a leading publication for the life sciences. Today, we’re announcing the beginning of a new vision for the journal which builds upon its earlier successes and pushes boundaries even further to promote Open Science and excellence in publishing. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We had considered holding back this announcement while so many of us are grappling with the impact of the ongoing coronavirus pandemic. However, we view it as our duty as publishers, now and in the long term, to accelerate the path to publication and increase transparent research practices. We believe the changes to the scope and new article types on </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">PLOS Biology, </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">outlined below, will help researchers in the life sciences rapidly share their early findings and preregister their studies, and may prove to be particularly useful in these difficult times.. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To lead this new phase for </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">PLOS Biology</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, we are also fortunate to welcome a talented and passionate new Editor-in-Chief, Nonia Pariente. Welcome, Nonia! </span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I’m very excited to take on this new role. PLOS Biology has a very strong reputation and an inspiring vision. I am passionate about broadening its reach to all of the Life Sciences communities and strengthening its position in the publishing landscape. All important advances in every area of biology should feel they have a home in PLOS Biology”.</span></i></p>

<p> </p>
<p><b>Pushing Boundaries in Service of Research</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When the journal launched, Open Access was an experimental publishing option. </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">PLOS Biology</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> proved that being highly selective and Open Access were perfectly compatible, aligning all the benefits of immediate and global accessibility with impactful research. Our aim has always been to challenge the status quo in scientific communication in order to better meet researchers’ needs. With our past experience to guide us, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">PLOS Biology</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is setting up a framework for assessment and publication that better aligns with the process of scientific inquiry itself, including:</span></p>
<p> </p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Redefined selectivity criteria which will emphasize the importance of the research question and the quality of its execution; </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">A preregistration option offering peer review of the study design, with guaranteed publication of the final research article–regardless of the results–for accepted protocols;</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Introduction of two linked article types, Discovery Reports and Update Articles, which enable researchers to report on ongoing work as their research develops and new information becomes available.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Combined with the existing criteria around openness of research data, a preprint deposition workflow, and the option for authors to publish their peer review history, these changes are part of PLOS’ larger goals to transform scientific communication in a way that empowers researchers to choose Open Science. </span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>Surfacing the importance of the entire research process, not just results</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As we’ve reflected on more than fifteen years of experience at </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">PLOS Biology</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and considered the publishing landscape, we acknowledge that publishing in highly selective journals remains an imperative for many researchers. The typical criteria used to select articles, however, continue to focus on novelty and perceived importance of the research results. As such, they continue to nurture a perverse system of incentives in which it matters to be first and to have an exciting headline–much less to be right and to have results that stand robustly to the test of time. </span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">PLOS Biology </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">has already started addressing this challenge by giving a premium to transparency and access to underlying data, methodology and reagents, to enhance reproducibility. By introducing its ‘scooping policy’ through which novelty is not a disqualifying criteria within six months of an initial report. By opening up its peer review process to give context to decisions, as well as publishing valuable studies with clearly stated caveats when the consensus among reviewers is unclear. And even by asking authors to remove speculative results to reduce the hype that they sometimes feel pressured to provide.</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">PLOS Biology</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> will remain a selective journal–don’t take me wrong. But in its selection process, the journal now seeks to more systematically emphasize the importance of the research question and the quality of its approach and execution, before considering the importance of the results. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The new preregistration workflow, in addition to all the benefits it offers for reducing bias in experimentation and reporting, is also meant to encourage researchers to undertake important and well-designed studies with uncertain outcomes instead of censoring their research ideas based on the odds of publication. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The new linked article types will allow researchers to share their work more quickly, and to more effectively separate exploratory research during which they generate hypotheses (to be published as a Discovery Report) from its confirmatory phases, during which the hypothesis is further tested and new insights generated (to be linked as an Update Article). </span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>Welcome, Nonia Pariente!</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Of course, none of this would be possible without a strong underlying editorial strategy. Joining our highly experienced team of staff editors, Nonia officially came on board earlier this month as Editor-in-Chief and is eager to get started on these new initiatives. </span></p>
<p> </p>
<blockquote><p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Since I started editing, and definitely as I have grown throughout my career as Chief Editor of </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nature Microbiology</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and now as Editor-in-Chief of </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">PLOS Biology</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, my goal has been to help science advance and to help scientists communicate their stories… I think what makes PLOS Biology and PLOS in general stand out is that it is an organization that was founded with the goal and drive to innovate the process of scientific publication for the benefit of scientists and scientific advance. Thinking outside the box is almost an obligation.”</span></i></p></blockquote>

                <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/~r/plos/Blog/~3/SrNSAlYYdMg/">PLOS ONE publishes additional Coronavirus-related papers</a></h4>

<p>Today <em>PLOS ONE</em> added to its <a href="https://collections.plos.org/">collection</a> of COVID-19 papers since we started <a href="https://blogs.plos.org/plos/2020/01/novel-coronavirus-2019-ncov-outbreak/">fast-tracking submissions on January 31</a><a href="https://blogs.plos.org/plos/2020/01/novel-coronavirus-2019-ncov-outbreak/"><sup>st</sup></a>.</p>
<p>This <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0230405">study</a> was conducted by Constantinos Siettos from the Universita degli Studi di Napoli Federico II, Italy and colleagues. The authors used the Susceptible-Infected-Recovered-Dead (SIRD) model with data between January 11 and February 10, 2020 and estimated key epidemiological parameters up until February 29. With these parameters, they forecasted that between 80,000 and 160,000 people would be infected by February 29 – in fact, around 84,000 are known to have become infected in this time period.</p>
<p>Dr Siettos notes, “This is the first study based on a mathematical modelling approach that has provided relatively accurate three- week-ahead forecasts. Importantly, to the best of our knowledge this is the first study based on a mathematical modelling approach suggesting that the actual number of the infections in the total population is of the order of twenty times more than those reported, and that the mortality rate in the total population is about ~0.15% i.e. significantly less than reported 2-3%.Our findings imply that for the case of Hubei (with a 60m population), around 2%-3% of the total population in Hubei has been actually infected by coronavirus.”</p>
<p>Science leaders have <a href="https://wellcome.ac.uk/sites/default/files/covid19-open-access-letter.pdf">recently requested</a> that the publishing community make their content open and re-usable. PLOS <a href="https://wellcome.ac.uk/press-release/publishers-make-coronavirus-covid-19-content-freely-available-and-reusable">already supports</a>, and calls on others to support, COVID-19 research being shared such that it can be centrally text- and data-mined, and also versioned in places where it can be most conveniently discovered by those tackling this crisis in real time. We always push <u>all </u>PLOS content to PubMed Central. We are also forwarding all of our submissions to the World Health Organization for their <a href="https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/global-research-on-novel-coronavirus-2019-ncov">database of publications on coronavirus disease (COVID-19)</a>.</p>
<p>We are  compiling all our Coronavirus-related papers into a <a href="https://collections.plos.org/">Collection</a> as they publish.

This adds up to around <strong>25 grams</strong> of sugar. According to <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/public-health-england">Public Health England</a> (PHE) children consume much more sugar than recommended; this equals around eight excess sugar cubes a day or <strong>2,800 excess</strong> <strong>sugar</strong> <strong>cubes</strong> per year.</p>
<p>This has instigated the ‘sugar smart’ campaign led by PHE which is aimed at raising awareness of the amount of sugars in foods and drinks and to encourage parents to reduce their children’s sugar consumption. ‘<a href="https://www.nhs.uk/change4life">Change4life</a>‘ is England’s first national social marketing campaign, promoting the following the slogan “Eat Well, Move More, Live Longer”.</p>

<p>The Change4Life Sugar Smart campaign was launched on January 4th 2016. TV, billboard and digital advertising ran for six weeks to support the campaign. A Sugar Smart app was available for parents to download free of charge. The app enabled users to scan barcodes on food and drink packaging to find out how many grams of total sugars were contained in the product; depicted in sugar cubes, to help consumers visualize the amount.</p>
<p><a href="https://bmcpublichealth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12889-020-8422-5?utm_source=bmc_blogs&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=null&amp;utm_campaign=blog_2020_bmcseriesblog">A recent study</a> published in <em>BMC Public Health</em> aimed to determine whether the campaign was effective in altering dietary behavior, by assessing any impact of the campaign on sugar intake among children aged 5-11 years. This included looking into the parental perceptions of the campaign and exploring barriers related to reducing sugar intake.</p>
<p>Parents/guardians were asked to report their child’s dietary intake; telephone interviews were also conducted. This covered a range of topics including understanding of the general change4life message, the impact of sugar on health and family and social barriers experienced whilst trying to reduce children’s sugar intake. Findings indicate that parents often feel confused over the difference between ‘good’ and ‘bad’ sugar.</p>
<blockquote><p><em>“[The children] thought because they couldn’t have sugar, they couldn’t have fruit and it was saying that sugar was bad, so we had to sort of explain that it’s not all bad; it’s just different types.”</em></p></blockquote>
<p>Following the campaign, many parents reported that they tried to switch out unhealthy food for a healthier version and reducing portion sizes, however, the largest barrier included time constraints due to a fast paced life style and the easy availability of sweet treats which led to increased leniency; for example, pudding at school or temptation in the local supermarkets.</p>
<blockquote><p><em>“You get tired and sometimes you go, “oh, just eat it then”</em></p></blockquote>
<p>Overall it was found that the health marketing campaign raised awareness of sugar in food and drinks in both parents and children, impacting food consumption in families. Sugar smart campaigns are likely to have a positive influence on reducing sugar consumption.</p>
<p><em>Targeting the parents:</em></p>
<p>The study concludes that a health marketing campaign aimed at both parents and children has a positive impact in reducing sugar intake, however, reductions in sugars are not always sustained long term.</p>
<p>Parents want to reduce their child’s sugar intake, but societal barriers as well as confusion over aspects of the diet to change often hamper efforts.</p>
<p>Generally, the campaign was successful in raising awareness amongst both parents and children. The findings suggest that further education is required when it comes to different types of sugar and food labeling.</p>
<p>Future campaigns should continue to target the parents, which in turn will have a knock on effect on reducing sugar consumption in the young. In the future campaigns should focus on combatting long term sugar reduction.</p>

<p><i>By</i> <a href="https://emmayoung.net/">Emma Young</a></p>
<p>“At least since the philosophers of ancient Greece, scholars have pointed out the analogy between madness (psychosis) and dreaming…” So begins a <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0230212">new paper</a>, published in <em>PLoS One</em>, that seems to shore up that analogy.</p>
<p>Dreams and psychotic hallucinations do have things in common. They both feature perceptual sensations that seem real, but which are conjured up by our brains.</p>
<p>However, there are also differences. While dreams are known to be highly visual, psychotic hallucinations are primarily auditory. They generally involve hearing things that aren’t real rather than seeing things that don’t exist. And this difference is an important reason why “the idea of dreaming as a model for psychosis has remained speculative and controversial,” write Roar Fosse of the Vestre Viken Hospital Trust, Norway, and Frank Larøi of the Norwegian Centre of Excellence for Mental Disorders Research at the University of Oslo.</p>
<p>However, to date, there’s been very little investigation into perceptions of sounds in dreams, the pair reports. And now they have data suggesting that, in fact, auditory perceptions are common. If this is the case, the links between psychotic experiences and dreams may be stronger than has been recently supposed.</p>
<p><span id="more-39407"></span>Fosse and Larøi used social networks and a psychology group on Facebook to recruit 13 people who reported having good dream recall, but no psychiatric disorders or any other condition. Neither did they report taking any medication that might affect their sleep. The group consisted of 12 women and one man (with a mean age of 28).</p>
<p>They were asked to keep a dream diary: to write down any dreams they could recall that had taken place just prior to awakening from sleep, and to keep doing this until they each had records for 10 dreams. They were told to record the detail of any dream, whether or not it featured sounds. But at the same time, they were asked to focus on any auditory content, and describe this in detail.</p>
<p>The researchers discovered that sounds featured often, being reported in 80% to 100% of each participant’s dreams. Most often, the sounds consisted of other people speaking. (There were even five instances described as speech in a foreign language that the dreamer did not understand.) But there were also 122 instances of the dreamer speaking and 59 instances of other types of sound, such as glass breaking, gun shots, people walking or running, and a radio playing.</p>
<p>“Considering that dream reports include experiences from only the last minutes of sleep before awakening, and that dreaming normally takes place throughout REM sleep as well as in light NREM sleep, the available evidence suggests that normal, healthy people usually experience internally generated auditory sensations an array of times every night,” the researchers conclude.</p>
<p>There are certainly some limitations to the study. This was a small group of almost all women who self-reported having good dream recall and who volunteered for the study — so may not represent the broader population. Also, rather than being regularly woken and asked what they were dreaming about, they only reported dreams when they woke spontaneously. Earlier work has found that such dreams tend to be more dramatic. So the content that they reported may not be typical of dreams experienced throughout the night.</p>
<p>However, the findings are intriguing, and hint at all kinds of interesting work to come.</p>
<p>There are some parallels between the normal sleep wake cycle and theories about how psychotic hallucinations come about. As someone falls asleep and moves through early sleep stages into REM, there’s a general decrease in reflective, directed thought and a gradual increase in internally-generated perceptions. Theories of psychotic hallucinations, meanwhile, propose that an impairment in higher order, “top-down” regions (typically in the prefrontal cortex) allows for more internally-generated, sensory-like hallucinatory experiences.</p>
<p>There is also some recent evidence suggesting similarities in the neurophysiological underpinnings of both dreams and psychotic hallucinations. Both states are associated with similar alterations in dopamine functioning and patterns of connectivity between certain regions of the cortex, for example.</p>
<p>It could possibly be an “intrinsic property of the brain-mind system” that reduced or compromised higher order cognitive, executive control facilitates both dream hallucinations and psychotic hallucinations, the researchers write.</p>
<p>However, though thinking about dreams and psychosis has a long history, it’s early days for this as a scientific field. More research will be needed to explore whether there really are meaningful, common underlying connections between the two states, or not.</p>

In the market for an admirably clear and concise retraction notice? Look no further!  A researcher in China has lost one — well, maybe two, more on that in a moment — 2015 articles for falsification of data and other misconduct. And one of the journals he tried to dupe is having none of it.  … <a class="more-link" href="https://retractionwatch.com/2020/03/31/a-tale-of-one-exceedingly-clear-retraction-notice-and-two-nonexistent-ones/">Continue reading <span class="screen-reader-text">A tale of one exceedingly clear retraction notice, and two nonexistent ones</span></a>

                <h4><a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/620581304/0/oupblogpsychology/">How to rate and rank potential doctoral students</a></h4>

<p>Graduate education, particularly the training of doctoral students, plays crucial role in the progress of society. Around 1,500 of the country’s 4,500 or so universities award doctoral degrees. In 2018 according to the <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://ncses.nsf.gov/pubs/nsf20301/data-tables/">Survey of Earned Doctorates </a>55,185 students were doctorate recipients in the United States.</p><p>To match potential graduate students and graduate programs needs the interplay among students, college professors as evaluators, and admission committees.  Many academics are involved in the admission process of graduate students.</p><p>As a college professor, it’s my seasonal duty each fall to write letters of recommendation and rate students based on several criteria in order to help them gain acceptance to graduate schools. Students should ask several professors to evaluate them. Occasionally, I have to tell a student that I would not be able to write a strong recommendation, so it would be better not to ask me. We evaluators combine quasi-objective data (say, grades) and subjective impressions to generate a rating score. Despite the subjective nature, these evaluations are far from random, and college professors don’t have better ways of helping students and graduate programs find a good match.   At the individual level, rating and ranking of application to graduate schools dramatically influences the life of students. Admissions committees have a strong interest in ensuring they only accept mature, polite, reliable, and stable people into their program, and my professional duty is to help them achieve this goal.</p><p>One company provides software as a service to many universities for admissions and applications evaluations. Its software uses six criteria to rate students:</p><ul type="disc"><li>Knowledge in chosen field</li><li>Motivation and perseverance toward goals</li><li>Ability to work independently</li><li>Ability to express thoughts in speech and writing</li><li>Ability/potential for college teaching</li><li>Ability to plan and conduct research</li></ul><p>For each criterion, the evaluator picks among five options: exceptional (upper 5%), outstanding (nxt 15%), very good (next 15%), good (next 15%), and okay (next 50%).</p><p>How do we generate the numbers and check the appropriate rubric? In principle, a micro-rationalist, bottom-up approach would work. Teachers could collect and store data from students throughout decades, and they might have a formal algorithm for calculating the percentages. I believe it is more likely that many of us apply top-down strategies. We ask ourselves:  do I want to grant a set of grades that is all exceptional? Does the applicant have a clear weak point, in which I should check the third or maybe the fourth category? What if I score, say,  four outstanding and two exceptional?  The table below shows an example:</p><figure><img height="288" src="https://blog.oup.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/EOQ4yPK5dd0-180x76.jpg" width="682" />Image credit: Peter Érdi</figure><p>I thought this student should be supported, because she seemed to be very motivated, independent and clever. However, I have never checked anybody to be “exceptional” in all categories. First, nobody is exceptional in everything, second, it would be suspicious if my scores were unfair and consciously biased, and so it might be counterproductive. In the case shown in the figure the candidate had little experience in her chosen field, so I checked the second column. Probably the third or even the fourth column would have been more appropriate. I did not feel I was cheating, but I knew I was a little biased.</p><p>Good or bad, decision makers calculate the sum of the scores, analyze their distribution, read the recommendations, and adopt some strategies to bring  decisions. (In some version of the ranking game, weights are assigned to the different features, to expressing the relative importance of the different features. University ranking systems  famously assign relative percentage weights to each ranking factors .) While rating with numbers contains subjective elements, we don’t have better ways to approximate objectivity.</p><p>The notion of objective reality refers to anything that exists as it is independently of any conscious awareness or perceiver. Subjective reality is related to anything that depends upon some conscious awareness or some perceiver. Objectivity is associated with concepts like reality, truth, and reliability. Objectively ranking the tallest buildings in the world is relatively easy, since it is based on verifiable facts, and we have a result that everybody will accept.</p><p>If we accept that it is an impossible task to objectively ranking graduate students, what we could and should do? On the one hand, we could improve our ranking methodologies, on the other hand we (all stakeholders of the game from students to professors) should feel that our actions are as fair as possible.</p><p><em>Featured Image by Joshua Golde from </em><a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://unsplash.com/photos/qIu77BsFdds"><em>Unsplash</em></a></p><p>The post <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://blog.oup.com/2020/03/how-to-rate-and-rank-potential-doctoral-students/">How to rate and rank potential doctoral students</a> appeared first on <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://blog.oup.com">OUPblog</a>.</p><img align="left" border="0" height="1" hspace="0" src="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/i/620581304/0/oupblogpsychology" style="border: 0; float: left; margin: 0; padding: 0; width: 1px!important; height: 1px!important;" width="1" /><div style="clear: both; padding-top: 0.2em;"><a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/2/620581304/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/fbshare20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/28/620581304/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/fblike20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/30/620581304/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/googleplus20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/16/620581304/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/linkedin20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/29/620581304/oupblogpsychology,https%3a%2f%2fblog.oup.com%2fwp-content%2fuploads%2f2020%2f03%2fEOQ4yPK5dd0-180x76.jpg"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/pinterest20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/1/620581304/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/reddit20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/24/620581304/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/twitter20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/19/620581304/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/email20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/20/620581304/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/rss20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a><h3 style="clear: left; padding-top: 10px;">Related Stories</h3><ul><li><a href="https://blog.oup.com/2020/04/the-surprising-scientific-value-of-national-bias/" rel="nofollow">The surprising scientific value of national bias</a></li><li><a href="https://blog.oup.com/2020/03/a-guide-to-parent-self-care-during-the-covid-19-pandemic/" rel="nofollow">A guide to parent self-care during the COVID-19 pandemic</a></li><li><a href="https://blog.oup.com/2020/03/how-we-can-equip-ourselves-against-climate-change/" rel="nofollow">How we can equip ourselves against climate change</a></li></ul> </div>

<p>In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, arXiv now offers a <a href="https://arxiv.org/covid19search">quick search link to all coronavirus and COVID-19 research</a> hosted on <a href="http://arxiv.org">arXiv.org</a>. The search results are sorted by date, with the most recent papers at the top of the list.</p>
<p>Also new on the arXiv homepage is an external link to<a href="https://connect.biorxiv.org/relate/content/181"> medRxiv and bioRxiv</a> preprints about the coronavirus and COVID-19.</p>

<p>“In times like this, we need global collaboration in research and shared knowledge among different disciplines,” says Eleonora Presani, arXiv Executive Director. “arXiv allows researchers from different backgrounds and geographical locations to quickly share their findings and push forward for the discoveries we need. It is an ideal platform for researchers to communicate with each other when speed is of extreme importance.”</p>
<p>As a free, fast, and open access scholarly research distribution service, arXiv accelerates the pace at which science can advance. And online communication is particularly relevant now, with researchers around the world isolated due to travel restrictions and conference cancellations.</p>
<p>“In the context of a pandemic like the one we’re experiencing, it is crucial to get information to people quickly, and arXiv provides a shared infrastructure and community to get scientific research to those that can make a difference,” says Greg Morrisett, Jack and Rilla Neafsey Dean and Vice Provost of<a href="http://tech.cornell.edu"> Cornell Tech</a>. “Already, there are preprints on topics ranging from genomic structure of the virus to epidemiological studies to projected economic impacts, and from every corner of the globe.”</p>
<p>The new quick search link will expedite efficient research discovery, says Steinn Sigurdsson, arXiv Scientific Director. “Within arXiv, research on the coronavirus, associated clinical syndromes, and epidemiology is spread across multiple disciplines and tagged with a number of different keywords. In the interest of expediency, we are providing a direct curated link to e-prints with the most commonly used tags.”</p>
<p>Like other preprint servers, arXiv does not facilitate in-depth peer-review and does not specifically endorse the contents of the documents it hosts. Results on <a href="http://arXiv.org">arXiv.org</a> should be considered preliminary and not used to guide clinical practice or health-related behavior. Likewise, such findings should not be reported in the news media as established information.</p>

<p><em>By </em><a href="http://emilyoliviareynolds.com/">Emily Reynolds</a></p>
<p>Breaking up is never easy, particularly when you’re confronted with memories of happier times. A <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2020/03/18/trouble-sleeping-the-scent-of-your-lover-might-help/">smell</a>, an old photograph, a note somebody left you — weeks or even months after a break-up and you can still be reminded of your ex-partner, whether you like it or not.</p>
<p>On social media, this can be even worse. If you’re still friends with your ex, you’re likely to still see their posts on your feed; if you’re not, you can still rub salt into the wound by checking their profile anyway. ‘On this Day’ features are also notoriously bad for bringing up unhappy memories at the worst possible time.</p>
<p>According to a<span> </span><a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3359172">new study</a><span> </span><span>published in</span><span> </span><em>Proceedings of the ACM on Human-Computer Interaction, </em>we also see our exes so much because of the so-called “social periphery” — the networks of people we know tangentially through our ex-partners<span>. So why not design an algorithm that causes us less pain? </span><span>The new work suggests that this could be the answer to our online break-up woes.</span></p>
<p><span id="more-39396"></span>The study, conducted by Anthony Pinter and colleagues at the University of Colorado Boulder, focused on 19 adult Facebook users based in the US. Semi-structured interviews were held with each of the users on their feelings around break-ups and social media. Each had been in a relationship prior to the interview — either dating, cohabiting, or marriage — and were aged between 19 and 46.</p>
<p>Participants described a range of experiences in which they came into contact with their ex-partners online, from anything between six days to five years after the break-up. They were then asked to focus on specific features that could stop them from coming across their ex — unfriending or unfollowing, for example, or changing the way they view their newsfeed.</p>
<p>Unsurprisingly, emotions ran high. Participants reported feeling pained by seeing content involving their ex-partners, whether that was new information (such as an ex’s new relationship status) or past memories (such as anniversary posts or photographs). “The most upsetting thing on Facebook is On This Day,” one participant said. “It said I was the best husband ever and she loved me the most… I remember that, and obviously not physically being hurt, but just feeling an emotional wallop of like ‘Fuck, that wasn’t that long ago’”.</p>
<p>This was all fairly unexpected: unwanted contact with an ex-partner is obviously going to be difficult in some regard. But while the problem may be well-established and familiar, there could still be a novel response.</p>
<p>The problem, the authors argue, is that machine learning has focused on methods that “fail to capture social nuances, relationships and other human-centred concerns” — in other words, that the algorithms present to us an unnatural or unhelpful model of our social relationships.</p>
<p>There are workarounds when it comes to existing platforms — unfriending, unfollowing or blocking ex-partners, or opting out of features like ‘On This Day’. But because of the social periphery, distant connections still linger after a break-up: one participant talked of their ex-partner’s mother’s frequent appearance on their feed.</p>
<p>Being clear about what will happen when you mute or block someone is a good first step. But such fixes, the authors believe, are far from perfect. It’s the algorithms themselves that need changing, taking into consideration our complex social peripheries as well as our one-to-one connections.</p>
<p>Currently, algorithms mainly take notice of binary connections — how much or little we choose to see from one particular person. By tweaking these algorithms to take into consideration not only peripheral <em>relationships</em> but also events, interests, photos and groups could mean our social periphery is both better represented online and easier to evade post-break up.</p>
<p>The complexities of such encounters should also be taken into consideration. It’s unlikely to matter if an ex has clicked ‘attending’ on a large event that spans multiple days or takes place in multiple locations, so seeing that they’ve done so may cause unnecessary pain. Knowing they’re likely to attend a small gathering of friends, however, may be more useful information if you’re keen to avoid an awkward meeting.</p>
<p>When, or if, algorithms become more human-focused, we may find ourselves having less stressful interactions with our ex-partners online. Blocking and unfriending might not be perfect, but at the moment may be the next best thing.</p>

Large droplets were thought to contaminate the area immediately surrounding an infected individual, because they settle before evaporating. In contrast, small  droplets evaporate quickly and form residual particulates, or aerosols. However, the classification of droplet size (and therefore the mode of transmission) is not based on modern science. Yet this scheme still informs public health policy to this day.<br /><br />The figure above shows a Multiphase Turbulent Gas Cloud From a Human Sneeze (<a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2763852">Bourouiba, 2020</a>).

                <h4><a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/620455710/0/oupblogpsychology/">A guide to parent self-care during the COVID-19 pandemic</a></h4>

<p>As school closures and quarantines take place across the globe, the overwhelming anxiety is palpable in the newfound realities of a pandemic. Trips to the grocery store are now strategized, as shoppers face empty shelves and shortages of household staples. This will undoubtably continue as anxiety thrives on uncertainty increasing stress and driving us to seek answers and information in an evolving landscape. Keeping ourselves healthy and safe is a tall order and is further compounded by the challenge of maintaining our values and goals as parents. Still, it is vital that we support ourselves as individuals first, because maintaining our mental and physical health is the foundation from which we support our children during these trying times.</p><p><strong>First and foremost – plan</strong><br />More than ever, it is important to follow the warnings and guidelines of trusted resources. This includes the WHO, state and local governments, and public health agencies. For personal advice, turn to your doctor and your child’s pediatrician. Websites, including the <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~www.healthychildren.org/">American Academy of Pediatrics</a>, are another source of trusted information.</p><p><strong>Disconnect to reconnect</strong><br />After keeping up to date with developments in the pandemic, schedule time to disconnect from the consumption of social media and news outlets. Being bombarded with information fuels panic and inhibits preparedness. Further, media consumption turns you away from face-to-face interactions with your partner/spouse and children leading to missed opportunities for connection and comfort. By imposing limits, we can model how to manage our handling of difficult information, and also limit our child’s exposure to anxiety ridden media and social media content.</p><p>Simultaneously, take this hibernation as an opportunity to recharge and strengthen bonds as a family. The forced decluttering of our schedules allows us to foster one-on-one interactions, a sense of togetherness, and protects us from anxiety.</p><p><strong>Maintain your foundation</strong><br />Undoubtably routines, habits, and daily activities are disrupted by cancellations in schools, activities, and events. These disruptions are unavoidable, unnerving, and trigger negative emotions that may stray us away from essential self-care routines needed to support our health and mental health. Self-care takes many forms including daily mediation practice, home-based hobbies (such as cooking/baking, gardening, redecorating, channeling your inner Marie Kondo), exercise, crafting or sewing, writing, art, collecting, reading, etc. By taking care of yourself first you are fueling your ability to care for others and minimizing your vulnerability to illness, irritability, and anxiety – all of which draw you away from mindful parenting. For example, I have committed to starting each day with a yoga practice and ending many days with a meditation practice. These few quiet moments ensure that no matter how much arguing my kids do (with myself or each other), I reduce my vulnerability to stray from my parenting goals.</p><p><strong>Reconnect with natural joys</strong><br />Exercise and nature are pillars for maintaining our health and mental health, making them an essential part of our daily routine. Vitamin D, daily exposure to the elements, and physical activity help maintain our health, ensure better sleep, and protect us from negative moods. This is also a great way to pass time with kids or grab a few moments of needed solitude. This can be as simple as doing daily activities outside such as meals, reading, work, and schoolwork or more adventurous such as exploring your neighborhood or local hiking paths.</p><p><strong>Practice gratitude and altruism</strong><br />Reflecting on the gifts of today is an essential element of happiness and contentment. And while it is easy to ruminate on our loss of freedom and normalcy, focusing on the negative only perpetuates despair. Although it may not be automatic, taking a few minutes each day to mindfully list things you are thankful for will change your perspective and increase your sense of well-being. The practice of gratitude is also great for the whole family, allowing children to focusing on the positive.</p><p>The same goes for helping others in a time of need. Can you run errands for your elderly neighbor? Or help organize activities for kids and share them with other parents? Take this opportunity to sort out old toys, books, and clothes and make donations to charity? By helping others, we strengthen our sense of belonging and gain a sense of community.</p><p><strong>Know when to seek help</strong><br />Lastly, as you and your family will undoubtably experience anxiety during the coming days and weeks it is important to know when and where to seek help. Panic will only fuel impulsive behavior, reduce intelligent decision making, and increase our vulnerability. The Anxiety and Depression Association of America has compiled <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://adaa.org/finding-help/coronavirus-anxiety-helpful-resources">a list of trusted resources</a> and expert tips. Taking care of your mental health is a vital part of ensuring that your kids and teens navigate this time successfully. We know from well-established scientific studies that children’s mental health improves when parents seek mental health care first.</p><p><em>Featured Image Credit: </em><a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://www.freepik.com/free-photo/mother-little-son-sitting-windowsill_6632009.htm"><em>Photo</em></a><em> </em><em>by prostooleh via Freepik</em></p><p>The post <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://blog.oup.com/2020/03/a-guide-to-parent-self-care-during-the-covid-19-pandemic/">A guide to parent self-care during the COVID-19 pandemic</a> appeared first on <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://blog.oup.com">OUPblog</a>.</p><img align="left" border="0" height="1" hspace="0" src="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/i/620455710/0/oupblogpsychology" style="border: 0; float: left; margin: 0; padding: 0; width: 1px!important; height: 1px!important;" width="1" /><div style="clear: both; padding-top: 0.2em;"><a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/2/620455710/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/fbshare20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/28/620455710/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/fblike20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/30/620455710/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/googleplus20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/16/620455710/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/linkedin20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/29/620455710/oupblogpsychology,"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/pinterest20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/1/620455710/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/reddit20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/24/620455710/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/twitter20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/19/620455710/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/email20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/20/620455710/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/rss20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a><h3 style="clear: left; padding-top: 10px;">Related Stories</h3><ul><li><a href="https://blog.oup.com/2020/03/the-story-of-covid-19-by-the-numbers/" rel="nofollow">The story of COVID-19, by the numbers</a></li><li><a href="https://blog.oup.com/2020/03/lessons-for-the-coronavirus-from-the-1899-honolulu-plague/" rel="nofollow">Lessons for the coronavirus from the 1899 Honolulu plague</a></li><li><a href="https://blog.oup.com/2020/04/maths-can-help-you-thrive-during-the-covid-19-pandemic/" rel="nofollow">Maths can help you thrive during the COVID-19 pandemic</a></li></ul> </div>

                <h4><a href="https://xcorr.net/2020/03/27/reverse-correlation-linearizing-black-box-functions/">Reverse correlation: linearizing black-box functions</a></h4>

<p>Reverse correlation is a tried-and-tested nonlinear systems identification method to understand biological neurons. The idea is to open the black box that is a biological neuron by using random stimuli to probe how the neuron responds. We present a series of random stimuli to a sensory neuron. By averaging those that generated a response, we obtain the spike-triggered average. The spike-triggered average is equal to the weights of a linear filter that approximates the response of a neuron. Under this linearity assumption, it is also a neuron’s preferred stimulus.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img alt="Reverse correlation in a nutshell.

Source: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Illustration_diagram_for_the_Spike-triggered_average.pdf">Wikipedia</a>.</figure>



<p>Reverse correlation has fallen out of favour as people have graduated to more complex models (e.g. GLMs and deep nets) with more complex stimuli (natural scenes) to probe brain representations. However, the machinery underlying reverse correlation is making somewhat of an unexpected comeback in different corners of machine learning. This is something that I’m sure will surprise many machine learning people as well as neuroscientists. Digging deeper into these subfields yields some insights on improvements in nonlinear systems identification that we can take back to computational neuroscience. In this article, I discuss two of these ideas:</p>



<ul><li>evolution strategies, which are black-box optimization methods</li><li>locally interpretable models, which are linearization models to open up black box models like deep neural nets</li></ul>



<p>Before I dig into these methods, let’s dig into the theory behind reverse correlation so we can understand its deep structure.</p>



<h3>The theory behind reverse correlation</h3>



<p>Reverse correlation seemed pretty magical when I first encountered it! Put noise into a system, measure responses – out comes the kernel (?!). I ended up <a href="https://xcorr.files.wordpress.com/2008/03/thesis-superduperfinal.pdf">writing my PhD thesis on systems identification</a>, so you’d think that by the time I graduated my thinking on this was solidified. In the years since, I’ve found that reverse correlation is actually pretty darn subtle, and I’ve developed a new appreciation for all the subtle aspects of the technique.</p>



<p>There’s a good exposition of the ideas behind reverse correlation in <a href="https://www.mitpressjournals.org/doi/10.1162/neco.2006.18.12.3097">Franz &amp; Schölkopf (2006)</a>. Let’s say that we are trying to characterize a nonlinear system that receives <img alt="N" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=N&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=3a3a3a&amp;s=0" title="N" /> real inputs and outputs a noisy scalar <img alt="y" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=y&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=3a3a3a&amp;s=0" title="y" />:</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center"><img alt="\mathbb E [y|x] = f(\bold x) \newline \text{where } \bold x \in \mathbb R^N" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmathbb+E+%5By%7Cx%5D+%3D+f%28%5Cbold+x%29+%5Cnewline+%5Ctext%7Bwhere+%7D+%5Cbold+x+%5Cin+%5Cmathbb+R%5EN&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=3a3a3a&amp;s=0" title="\mathbb E [y|x] = f(\bold x) \newline \text{where } \bold x \in \mathbb R^N" /></p>



<p>Then, under certain regularity conditions, we can write the mean response function of the system <img alt="f(\bold x)" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f%28%5Cbold+x%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=3a3a3a&amp;s=0" title="f(\bold x)" /> as a polynomial expansion, the Volterra expansion:</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center"><img alt="f(\bold x) \approx h_0 + (\bold x - \bold x_0)^T \cdot h_1 + (\bold x - \bold x_0)^T h_2 (\bold x - \bold x_0) + \ldots" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f%28%5Cbold+x%29+%5Capprox+h_0+%2B+%28%5Cbold+x+-+%5Cbold+x_0%29%5ET+%5Ccdot+h_1+%2B+%28%5Cbold+x+-+%5Cbold+x_0%29%5ET+h_2+%28%5Cbold+x+-+%5Cbold+x_0%29+%2B+%5Cldots&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=3a3a3a&amp;s=0" title="f(\bold x) \approx h_0 + (\bold x - \bold x_0)^T \cdot h_1 + (\bold x - \bold x_0)^T h_2 (\bold x - \bold x_0) + \ldots" /></p>



<p>Note that the kernels <img alt="h_i" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=h_i&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=3a3a3a&amp;s=0" title="h_i" /> have increasing order: <img alt="h_0" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=h_0&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=3a3a3a&amp;s=0" title="h_0" /> is a scalar, <img alt="h_1" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=h_1&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=3a3a3a&amp;s=0" title="h_1" /> a vector, <img alt="h_2" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=h_2&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=3a3a3a&amp;s=0" title="h_2" /> a matrix, <img alt="h_3" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=h_3&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=3a3a3a&amp;s=0" title="h_3" /> a three-index tensor, etc. The form of the expansion is similar to a Taylor expansion, and it’s tempting to identify the two.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>Misconception: the Volterra expansion is a Taylor expansion</p></blockquote>



<p>The Volterra expansion is more general than a Taylor expansion: a Taylor expansion requires well-defined derivatives to every order, while a Volterra expansion does not. For example, the function <img alt="f(x) = \exp(-1/x^2)" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f%28x%29+%3D+%5Cexp%28-1%2Fx%5E2%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=3a3a3a&amp;s=0" title="f(x) = \exp(-1/x^2)" /> has 0 derivatives everywhere. Hence, its Taylor expansion around 0 is exactly 0. However, it has a perfectly good non-null Volterra expansion, which can be found through polynomial regression. <a href="https://github.com/patrickmineault/xcorr-notebooks/blob/master/Expansion-Schmexpansion.ipynb">Here’s a notebook that shows you how it’s done</a>.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img alt="Approximating a function with zero derivatives with a Volterra expansion" src="https://xcorr.files.wordpress.com/2020/03/volterra2.png" />Approximating a function with a null Taylor series with polynomials.</figure>



<p>This subtle difference might seem like some nit-picking, but in practice, it is very important: discontinuous functions and stochastic functions can both be approximated with Volterra series. Biological Neurons are both stochastic and have potentially very sharp nonlinearities, yet we can still approximate them using a Volterra expansion.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>The Wiener expansion is an orthogonalized version of the Volterra expansion.</p></blockquote>



<p>To estimate the coefficients of the Volterra expansion, conventional reverse correlation first rearranges the Volterra expansion into an equivalent series of functionals, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wiener_series">Wiener expansion</a>:</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center"><img alt="f(\bold x) = \sum_i G_i[\bold x]" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f%28%5Cbold+x%29+%3D+%5Csum_i+G_i%5B%5Cbold+x%5D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=3a3a3a&amp;s=0" title="f(\bold x) = \sum_i G_i[\bold x]" /></p>



<p>And imposes that these functionals are orthogonal to each other:</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center"><img alt="\mathbb E_D[G_i(x)G_j(x)] = 0 \text{ for } i \ne j" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmathbb+E_D%5BG_i%28x%29G_j%28x%29%5D+%3D+0+%5Ctext%7B+for+%7D+i+%5Cne+j&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=3a3a3a&amp;s=0" title="\mathbb E_D[G_i(x)G_j(x)] = 0 \text{ for } i \ne j" /></p>



<p>Here <img alt="D" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=3a3a3a&amp;s=0" title="D" /> is the data distribution. Orthogonality is imposed via a Gram-Schmidt orthogonalization process:</p>



<ol><li>Set <img alt="G_0" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=G_0&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=3a3a3a&amp;s=0" title="G_0" /> to the output of the Volterra kernel of order 0</li><li>Set <img alt="G_1" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=G_1&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=3a3a3a&amp;s=0" title="G_1" /> to the output of the Volterra kernel of order 1, and back-project <img alt="G_0" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=G_0&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=3a3a3a&amp;s=0" title="G_0" /> from <img alt="G_1" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=G_1&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=3a3a3a&amp;s=0" title="G_1" /> to make <img alt="G_1" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=G_1&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=3a3a3a&amp;s=0" title="G_1" /> orthogonal to <img alt="G_0" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=G_0&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=3a3a3a&amp;s=0" title="G_0" /></li><li>Set <img alt="G_2" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=G_2&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=3a3a3a&amp;s=0" title="G_2" /> to the output of the Volterra kernel of order 2, and back-project <img alt="G_0" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=G_0&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=3a3a3a&amp;s=0" title="G_0" /> and <img alt="G_1" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=G_1&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=3a3a3a&amp;s=0" title="G_1" /> from <img alt="G_2" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=G_2&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=3a3a3a&amp;s=0" title="G_2" /> to make <img alt="G_2" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=G_2&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=3a3a3a&amp;s=0" title="G_2" /> orthogonal to both, etc.</li></ol>



<p>This is the itty-bitty subtle bit: it turns out that the expectations of every order are straightforward to calculate when the data distribution <img alt="D" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=3a3a3a&amp;s=0" title="D" /> is normal. The 0’th order and 1st order functionals are simply the constant and linear Volterra kernels. The 2nd order functional is the quadratic kernel minus a correction for the diagonal terms of the kernel, since the square of a normally-distributed variable distribution has a mean equal to the square of the standard deviation, <img alt="\mathbb E[x^2] = \sigma^2" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmathbb+E%5Bx%5E2%5D+%3D+%5Csigma%5E2&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=3a3a3a&amp;s=0" title="\mathbb E[x^2] = \sigma^2" />. Thus:</p>

<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>Estimating Wiener series with white noise means finding estimates that minimize sum-of-squares between prediction and measurement over the stimulus ensemble. We use a few shortcuts enabled by properties of white noise.</p></blockquote>



<p>What does <em>estimate</em> mean in this context? Least-squares! To estimate the zero-order kernel, we have:</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center"><img alt="\hat k_0 = \arg \min_{k_0} \sum(y - k_0)^2 = \bar y" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Chat+k_0+%3D+%5Carg+%5Cmin_%7Bk_0%7D+%5Csum%28y+-+k_0%29%5E2+%3D+%5Cbar+y&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=3a3a3a&amp;s=0" title="\hat k_0 = \arg \min_{k_0} \sum(y - k_0)^2 = \bar y" /></p>



<p>For the first-order kernel:</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center"><img alt="\hat k_1 = \arg \min_{k_1} \sum(y - \bar y - (x - x_0)^T k_1 )^2 \newline = ((x - x_0)^T (x-x_0))^{-1} (x-x_0)^T (y - \bar y) \newline \approx \frac{1}{N \sigma^2} (x-x_0)^T (y - \bar y)" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Chat+k_1+%3D+%5Carg+%5Cmin_%7Bk_1%7D+%5Csum%28y+-+%5Cbar+y+-+%28x+-+x_0%29%5ET+k_1+%29%5E2+%5Cnewline+%3D+%28%28x+-+x_0%29%5ET+%28x-x_0%29%29%5E%7B-1%7D+%28x-x_0%29%5ET+%28y+-+%5Cbar+y%29+%5Cnewline+%5Capprox+%5Cfrac%7B1%7D%7BN+%5Csigma%5E2%7D+%28x-x_0%29%5ET+%28y+-+%5Cbar+y%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=3a3a3a&amp;s=0" title="\hat k_1 = \arg \min_{k_1} \sum(y - \bar y - (x - x_0)^T k_1 )^2 \newline = ((x - x_0)^T (x-x_0))^{-1} (x-x_0)^T (y - \bar y) \newline \approx \frac{1}{N \sigma^2} (x-x_0)^T (y - \bar y)" /></p>



<p>Here the approximate sign comes from the fact that with normally distributed data, <img alt="(x - x_0)^T (x-x_0) \approx N\sigma^2 I" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%28x+-+x_0%29%5ET+%28x-x_0%29+%5Capprox+N%5Csigma%5E2+I&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=3a3a3a&amp;s=0" title="(x - x_0)^T (x-x_0) \approx N\sigma^2 I" />. The second order kernel is a little more tricky. We first define <img alt="r = y - \bar y - (x - x_0)^T" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=r+%3D+y+-+%5Cbar+y+-+%28x+-+x_0%29%5ET&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=3a3a3a&amp;s=0" title="r = y - \bar y - (x - x_0)^T" />. Then:</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center"><img alt="k_2 = \arg \min_{k_2} \sum \left(r - (x - x_0)^T k_2 (x - x_0) + \sigma^2 \sum_j k_2^{jj} \right)^2 \newline = \text{unstack}((D^T D)^{-1} D^T r) \newline" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=k_2+%3D+%5Carg+%5Cmin_%7Bk_2%7D+%5Csum+%5Cleft%28r+-+%28x+-+x_0%29%5ET+k_2+%28x+-+x_0%29+%2B+%5Csigma%5E2+%5Csum_j+k_2%5E%7Bjj%7D+%5Cright%29%5E2+%5Cnewline+%3D+%5Ctext%7Bunstack%7D%28%28D%5ET+D%29%5E%7B-1%7D+D%5ET+r%29+%5Cnewline&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=3a3a3a&amp;s=0" title="k_2 = \arg \min_{k_2} \sum \left(r - (x - x_0)^T k_2 (x - x_0) + \sigma^2 \sum_j k_2^{jj} \right)^2 \newline = \text{unstack}((D^T D)^{-1} D^T r) \newline" /></p>



<p>The columns of the matrix <img alt="D" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=3a3a3a&amp;s=0" title="D" /> is composed of all the cross-products <img alt="x_i x_j - \delta_{ij} \sigma^2" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x_i+x_j+-+%5Cdelta_%7Bij%7D+%5Csigma%5E2&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=3a3a3a&amp;s=0" title="x_i x_j - \delta_{ij} \sigma^2" /> for <img alt="i \ge j" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=i+%5Cge+j&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=3a3a3a&amp;s=0" title="i \ge j" />. The operator <img alt="\text{unstack}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Ctext%7Bunstack%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=3a3a3a&amp;s=0" title="\text{unstack}" /> takes this linear representation of the coefficients and transforms them into a matrix. Here again, we find that for normally distributed inputs, the non-diagonal terms in the covariance matrix <img alt="D^TD" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=D%5ETD&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=3a3a3a&amp;s=0" title="D^TD" /> have an expected value of zero. The inverse of the diagonal is a bit more tricky to calculate, but a little bit of grinding shows that we pick up a scalar factor <img alt="\frac{1}{2!\sigma^{4}}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cfrac%7B1%7D%7B2%21%5Csigma%5E%7B4%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=3a3a3a&amp;s=0" title="\frac{1}{2!\sigma^{4}}" />. In fact, we can show that the estimate of the kernels can be written as:</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center"><img alt="k_i(j_1, j_2, \ldots j_i) = \frac{1}{i!\sigma^{2i}N} [y - \sum_{m=0}^{i-1} G_m(\mathbf x)] x_{j_1} x_{j_2} \ldots x_{j_i}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=k_i%28j_1%2C+j_2%2C+%5Cldots+j_i%29+%3D+%5Cfrac%7B1%7D%7Bi%21%5Csigma%5E%7B2i%7DN%7D+%5By+-+%5Csum_%7Bm%3D0%7D%5E%7Bi-1%7D+G_m%28%5Cmathbf+x%29%5D+x_%7Bj_1%7D+x_%7Bj_2%7D+%5Cldots+x_%7Bj_i%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=3a3a3a&amp;s=0" title="k_i(j_1, j_2, \ldots j_i) = \frac{1}{i!\sigma^{2i}N} [y - \sum_{m=0}^{i-1} G_m(\mathbf x)] x_{j_1} x_{j_2} \ldots x_{j_i}" /></p>



<p>Where <img alt="G_j" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=G_j&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=3a3a3a&amp;s=0" title="G_j" /> are the orthogonalized Wiener functionals (equation 2, <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/3382067">Korenberg et al. 1988</a>). Notice the <img alt="i!" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=i%21&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=3a3a3a&amp;s=0" title="i!" /> factors, which look an awful lot like a Taylor expansion. <a href="https://github.com/patrickmineault/xcorr-notebooks/blob/master/Second-order-estimate.ipynb">This formula actually works! Here’s a notebook to show you how it’s done for a second order Wiener expansion</a>.</p>



<p>Is your head spinning yet? Mine sure was! Grinding through the kernels one by one makes a few things clear:</p>



<ol><li>Wiener-Volterra analysis isn’t magic. It’s orthogonal polynomial regression estimated through least-squares, with approximations that are enabled by the use of a very special distribution of the inputs, the normal distribution. This means that expectations of different moments can be analytically calculated.</li><li>The Wiener kernel definitions change when you change the distribution of the input. This is because orthogonalization is dependent on the input distribution.</li><li>The easy estimation of the kernels via backprojection and simple multiplication with cross-products of the inputs is lost when the input distribution is not normal.</li></ol>



<p>The special properties of white noise were very important technically in 1958 when the series was proposed: the kernels could be estimated with very minimal computing resources. A memoryless accumulator is sufficient. Today, we’re no longer bound by these limitations, and we can do Wiener-Volterra analysis in a much wider range of contexts. Casting Wiener-Volterra analysis as polynomial regression fit via least-squares immediately opens up many extensions:</p>



<ol><li>Finding better estimates via the minimum variance unbiased estimator, that is, maximum likelihood</li><li>Finding better estimates by better modeling the noise, for example, taking into account the Poisson nature of neural noise</li><li>Generalizing to non-normally distributed ensembles of inputs, again using maximum likelihood</li><li>Using alternative expansions, for example, cascades of linear-nonlinear filters (i.e. deep nets), fit with stochastic gradient descent</li></ol>



<p>Remarkably, some of the ideas behind Wiener-Volterra theory – local polynomial expansion, probing stimuli at random – have made their way into far-flung machine learning methods. Let’s take a look.</p>



<h3>Evolution strategies (ES)</h3>



<p><a href="http://www.scholarpedia.org/article/Evolution_strategies">Evolution strategies</a> (ES) are a family of black-box, gradient-free optimizers for potentially non-differentiable functions. At the heart of most optimizers over continuous variables is the computation of the gradient. If the gradient is unaccessible because of discontinuities, or because it is very expensive to calculate, we can obtain a <em>smoothed</em> gradient via the ES method.</p>



<p>The setup is quite clever. We have a function <img alt="f" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=3a3a3a&amp;s=0" title="f" /> that we are trying to optimize. Instead of computing its derivative <img alt="\nabla f(z)" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cnabla+f%28z%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=3a3a3a&amp;s=0" title="\nabla f(z)" /> directly, we compute the derivative of the expectation of the function, <img alt="\mathbb \nabla \mathbb E_\pi[f(z)]" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmathbb+%5Cnabla+%5Cmathbb+E_%5Cpi%5Bf%28z%29%5D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=3a3a3a&amp;s=0" title="\mathbb \nabla \mathbb E_\pi[f(z)]" /> in a local neighborhood <img alt="\pi(\theta, z)" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cpi%28%5Ctheta%2C+z%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=3a3a3a&amp;s=0" title="\pi(\theta, z)" />. Think of this expectation as a smoothed derivative.</p>



<p>To compute the expected value, we expand it via its definition, and obtain:</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center"><img alt="\nabla_\theta \mathbb E_\pi(z, \theta)[f(z)] = \nabla \int \pi(z, \theta) f(z) dz \newline = \int \nabla \pi(z, \theta) f(z) dz \newline = \int \nabla \log \pi(z, \theta) \pi(z, \theta) f(z) dz" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cnabla_%5Ctheta+%5Cmathbb+E_%5Cpi%28z%2C+%5Ctheta%29%5Bf%28z%29%5D+%3D+%5Cnabla+%5Cint+%5Cpi%28z%2C+%5Ctheta%29+f%28z%29+dz+%5Cnewline+%3D+%5Cint+%5Cnabla+%5Cpi%28z%2C+%5Ctheta%29+f%28z%29+dz+%5Cnewline+%3D+%5Cint+%5Cnabla+%5Clog+%5Cpi%28z%2C+%5Ctheta%29+%5Cpi%28z%2C+%5Ctheta%29+f%28z%29+dz&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=3a3a3a&amp;s=0" title="\nabla_\theta \mathbb E_\pi(z, \theta)[f(z)] = \nabla \int \pi(z, \theta) f(z) dz \newline = \int \nabla \pi(z, \theta) f(z) dz \newline = \int \nabla \log \pi(z, \theta) \pi(z, \theta) f(z) dz" /></p>



<p>The last equality, which is also called the <a href="http://blog.shakirm.com/2015/11/machine-learning-trick-of-the-day-5-log-derivative-trick/">log-derivative trick</a>, is derived from:</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center"><img alt="\nabla \log \pi(z,\theta) = \frac{\nabla \pi(z, \theta)}{\pi(z, \theta)}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cnabla+%5Clog+%5Cpi%28z%2C%5Ctheta%29+%3D+%5Cfrac%7B%5Cnabla+%5Cpi%28z%2C+%5Ctheta%29%7D%7B%5Cpi%28z%2C+%5Ctheta%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=3a3a3a&amp;s=0" title="\nabla \log \pi(z,\theta) = \frac{\nabla \pi(z, \theta)}{\pi(z, \theta)}" /></p>



<p>A neighbourhood which is often used in practice is the isotropic Gaussian centered at $\mu$ with a standard deviation $\sigma$. If we take a Monte Carlo estimate of the expectation, we find an approximation for the gradient as:</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center"><img alt="\nabla \mathbb E[f] \approx \frac{1}{N} \sum_{1}^N \nabla_\mu \log N(\mu, \sigma^2) \newline = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{1}^N \frac{1}{\sigma^2} (z-\mu) f(z)" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cnabla+%5Cmathbb+E%5Bf%5D+%5Capprox+%5Cfrac%7B1%7D%7BN%7D+%5Csum_%7B1%7D%5EN+%5Cnabla_%5Cmu+%5Clog+N%28%5Cmu%2C+%5Csigma%5E2%29+%5Cnewline+%3D+%5Cfrac%7B1%7D%7BN%7D+%5Csum_%7B1%7D%5EN+%5Cfrac%7B1%7D%7B%5Csigma%5E2%7D+%28z-%5Cmu%29+f%28z%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=3a3a3a&amp;s=0" title="\nabla \mathbb E[f] \approx \frac{1}{N} \sum_{1}^N \nabla_\mu \log N(\mu, \sigma^2) \newline = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{1}^N \frac{1}{\sigma^2} (z-\mu) f(z)" /></p>



<p>Notice this remarkable equation: this is exactly the response-triggered average with an isotropic gaussian stimulus ensemble. This reveals an unexpected link between reverse correlation and optimization: we can view reverse correlation as estimating an approximate gradient of the response function of a neuron.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>The response-triggered average tells us how we should change a stimulus locally to increase the response of the system.</p></blockquote>



<h4>Taking ES to reverse correlation</h4>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img alt="From the OpenAI blog, https://openai.com/blog/evolution-strategies/" src="https://xcorr.files.wordpress.com/2020/03/es.png" /><a href="https://openai.com/blog/evolution-strategies/">From the OpenAI blog</a>.</figure>



<p>The unexpected link between reverse correlation and optimization opens up a lot of different avenues. For instance, we could adapt ES to maximize the response of a neuron in a closed-loop fashion. This strategy has the advantage of being trivial to compute and highly intuitive (i.e. no complaints from reviewer 2 about the method being inscrutable).</p>



<p>ES is also embarrassingly parallel, which has been used to good effect in the context of reinforcement learning – OpenAI showcased ES with 1024 parallel evaluations. We could consider evaluating the gradient of a neuron’s response function in parallel with several other neurons – perhaps in a different animal, in a different lab – and optimize for a stimulus that maximizes the sum of the responses. Indeed, we don’t have to focus on maximizing just the mean response of a neuron: we can maximize the diversity of responses, their dimensionality, etc. This works as long as the metric that we’re measuring is a scalar function of the measured responses.</p>



<p>ES comes in a variety of different flavours that aim to increase the efficiency of the method. Two of the most popular variants are:</p>



<ul><li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CMA-ES">CMA-ES (Covariance-matrix-adaptation)</a>. This takes the derivative of the neighborhood with respect to the covariance of the normal distribution, in addition to its mean. Thus, the covariance stimulus ensemble is tweaked to capture the largest dimensions of descent.</li><li><a href="http://jmlr.org/papers/v15/wierstra14a.html">NES (Natural evolution strategies)</a>. This uses natural gradients rather than gradients, which naturally deals with rescaling of the axes.</li></ul>



<p>Both of these more efficient variants could be applied to find preferred stimuli in a population of neurons.</p>



<p>Finally, because the ES objective is a Monte Carlo estimate, we can import many of the tricks from the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variance_reduction">variance reduction literature</a> to increase the efficiency of reverse correlation. For example, we can use control variates or use stratified sampling strategies. My favourite trick to increase the efficiency of estimation: pairing every stimulus with its negative. With this trick, the mean of the realized stimulus ensemble is exactly the mean of the distribution. <a href="https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/patrickmineault/xcorr-notebooks/blob/master/Paired-sampling.ipynb">This antithetic sampling can, in some circumstances, increase the efficiency of the estimation of the preferred stimulus</a>.</p>



<h3>Locally interpretable models</h3>



<p>There’s another area where the ideas underlying reverse correlation have recently come together: <a href="https://christophm.github.io/interpretable-ml-book/lime.html">locally interpretable models</a>. Suppose that we have a complex black-box model that we are trying to better understand. This black box model can be, for example, a deep neural network. We can locally approximate this complex function with a simpler, local expansion. This local explanation does not capture all the subtleties of the model, but it can reveal insights that are useful for humans that want to understand the model.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>Black-box models are good for predictions by machines. White-box models are good for understanding by humans. LIME transforms black-box models into locally white-box models.</p></blockquote>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img alt="Toy example to present intuition for LIME.The black-box model’s complex decision function f(unknown to LIME) is represented by the blue/pinkbackground, which cannot be approximated well bya linear model. The bold red cross is the instancebeing explained. LIME samples instances, gets pre-dictions using f, and weighs them by the proximityto the instance being explained (represented hereby size).

<p>In general, we try to find a model <img alt="g" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=g&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=3a3a3a&amp;s=0" title="g" /> which approximates a complex function <img alt="f" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=3a3a3a&amp;s=0" title="f" /> according to a weight window <img alt="\pi" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cpi&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=3a3a3a&amp;s=0" title="\pi" />:</p>

<ul><li>a GAM</li><li>a decision tree</li><li>a linear model</li></ul>



<p>If we choose no penalty for complexity and choose a linear model class, our model and error function is equivalent to reverse correlation and evolutionary strategies. This highlight something that’s underappreciated about reverse correlation:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>The spike-triggered average is a simplified, locally valid explanation for how a neuron works. While complex models like deep nets can capture more of the variance in the data, the goal in reverse correlation is different: explaining neurons to humans.</p></blockquote>



<h4>Taking LIME to reverse correlation</h4>



<p>An underappreciated fact about reverse correlation is that the size of the neighbourhood around which we’re linearizing is arbitrary and that different neighbourhoods will lead to different estimates.</p>



<p>Many articles have documented that <a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/content/24/31/6991.short">receptive fields appear to change with changing stimulus ensembles</a>, for example natural vs. artificial stimuli. However, this has been explained in terms of a special, adaptive response of neurons to natural image statistics; for instance, that they increase the degree of feedforward inhibition they receive. In fact, the same phenomenon could happen simply because we’re measuring a nonlinear function, so that its locally linear expansion depends on the stimulus ensemble.</p>



<p>Many of the parameters of the probing distribution are arbitrary:</p>



<ul><li>the size of the neighborhood (big vs. small)</li><li>the shape of the neighborhood (isotropic Gaussian vs. non-isotropic vs. natural stimuli)</li><li>the center of the neighborhood (gray image or another reference)</li></ul>



<p>Some of the most interesting applications of nonlinear systems identification have manipulated each of these factors. For example, by shifting the center of the neighbourhood to an appropriate anchor point, we can locally linearize quadratic responses (i.e. complex cells) by choosing an appropriate anchor point. This is the idea behind Movshon et al. (1978), where the line weighting function of a complex cell is found by using another line in the center as an anchor:</p>

<p>There are some other excellent nuggets in the LIME paper that could serve us well. For instance, they suggest using a maximally diverse ensemble of examples (SP-LIME) to illustrate the functioning of the models to humans. <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1807.10589">A similar idea was used in Cadena et al. (2018) to visualize diverse features</a> that triggered large responses in early stages of a deep neural net around an anchor point (invariant or equivariant features).</p>



<p>Finally, we can have our cake and eat it too: we can fit very complex models of neurons that explain much of the variance in sensory systems using deep nets, and visualize how these models work using locally linear explanations. It sounds a little silly to fit a model to a model, but it’s a technique that has been used fruitfully both to <a href="https://www.pnas.org/content/109/16/E972.short">explain sensory neurons</a> and to <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1503.02531">compress neural networks</a>.</p>



<h3>Conclusions</h3>



<p>Both ES and LIME use local linearization strategies similar to reverse correlation to explain complex black box function. From ES, we learn that the reverse correlation estimate gives us a local approximation for the gradient, which can be used as a starting point for closed-loop experiments. From LIME, we see that we can perform reverse correlation centered around different neighbourhoods, yielding different results. By following these new research trends in machine learning, we can find innovative ways of opening the black boxes that are biological neurons.</p>

Trial of labor after Cesarean (TOLAC), with the aim of achieving vaginal birth rather than repeat CS, is considered a safe and reasonable option. However, the <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14662227">rate of TOLAC is decreasing</a>, especially in Japan, and most women who are eligible for TOLAC choose elective repeat Cesarean delivery (ERCD) without receiving detailed information about the merit of TOLAC. Obstetricians who do not offer the option of TOLAC underline for these women that TOLAC is a “dangerous” option even though the <a href="https://bmcpregnancychildbirth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12884-017-1440-3?utm_source=bmc_blogs&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=null&amp;utm_campaign=blog_2020_bmcseriesblog">risk of uterine rupture</a> is around 0.5% and ERCD has also a variety of complications, in contrast to successful TOLAC.</p>
<p>We have been thinking that the patient’s decision, rather than the doctor’s, is the most important to improve success rate of TOLAC. Therefore, we have performed a prospective study based on women’s decisions after receiving a detailed explanation of the risks and benefits of both TOLAC and ERCD. <a href="https://bmcpregnancychildbirth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12884-020-2833-2?utm_source=bmc_blogs&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=null&amp;utm_campaign=blog_2020_bmcseriesblog">Our new paper</a> in <a href="https://bmcpregnancychildbirth.biomedcentral.com/?utm_source=bmc_blogs&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=null&amp;utm_campaign=blog_2020_bmcseriesblog"><em>BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth</em></a> showed promising results.</p>
<h3><strong>Our criteria</strong></h3>
<p>Our TOLAC criteria, which are based on earlier studies, are shown in Table 1.  For pregnant women who met all these TOLAC criteria, we explained the risks and benefits of both TOLAC and ERCD with detailed documents, at 32 weeks of gestation. The documents about TOLAC included the risks of uterine rupture which occurs in around 0.5% of women, which is much higher than that of ERCD, and carries a risk of mortality for the fetus and/or the mother. On the other hand, ERCD has higher risks of bleeding, infection, thrombosis, and complication of subsequent pregnancies. The women in our study could choose their delivery mode after counseling on these risks.</p>

</table>
<p>We screened 1,086 pregnant women for eligibility and 735 met the above criteria. Of these, 64.1% opted for TOLAC. Earlier studies also showed the same rate, which means that if women receive sufficient education and support, they tend to choose TOLAC as their desirable mode of delivery. Obstetricians should understand this fact and should not underline only the risk of rare complications.</p>
<h3><strong>High success rate</strong></h3>
<p>Our study had a rate of successful TOLAC (vaginal birth) of 91.3%, similar to the vaginal birth rate of women who have no history of Cesarean, with the rate of uterine rupture being 0.6%. There were no infant deaths or long-term sequelae among all 471 TOLAC attempts. Apgar scores of &lt;7 at 5 minutes, which is a marker of fetal asphyxia, did not significantly differ between the two groups. Women with history of vaginal birth in addition to a prior CS had a high chance of successful TOLAC (96.4%), and when labor spontaneously occurred before 40 weeks of gestation, the success rate was favorable (97.6%).</p>
<blockquote><p>We have shown that TOLAC can be considered a reasonable means of birth.</p></blockquote>
<p>We have tried to reveal the reasons for this high success rate and showed that in the successful TOLAC group, 70.5% of women had a previous CS without labor due to non-recurrent indications, including breech presentation, placenta previa, severe preeclampsia, or suspected cephalopelvic disproportion. On the other hand, over 40% of women who chose repeat ERCD had a previous CS that followed unsuccessful labor due to indications such as labor arrest disorders or non-reassuring fetal status (p&lt;0.01). We believe these differences may have positively impacted the TOLAC success rate, partly because unsuitable candidates may have self-excluded from the TOLAC group.</p>
<h3><strong>Factors associated with failed TOLAC</strong></h3>
<p>This study revealed that factors related to failed TOLAC included ≥40 weeks of gestation and prelabor rupture of membranes (PROM). After 40 weeks of gestation, success rates decreased (from 97.6% to 76.9%). Half of failed TOLAC cases experienced PROM. Until now, there have been limited studies into the impact of PROM on TOLAC. Obstetricians should be encouraged to have ongoing discussions with women about their mode of delivery after the due date or PROM, as these may be indications to change from planned TOLAC to ERCD. Ongoing discussions throughout pregnancy are important for preventing complications.</p>
<h3><strong>Conclusions and recommendations</strong></h3>
<p>We have shown that TOLAC can be considered a reasonable means of birth not only for mothers but also for neonates, with over 60% of eligible women choosing TOLAC and over 90% of those achieving successful TOLAC. History of vaginal birth in addition to CS increased odds of successful TOLAC, while PROM or ≥40 weeks of gestation were risk factors for failed TOLAC. Obstetricians have to discuss the planned mode of birth throughout pregnancy in order to prevent complications.</p>
<p>Based on our results we would recommend that mothers who have elected ERCD choose a date of CS later than 39 weeks of gestation as some studies suggest a <a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa0803267">risk of increased negative respiratory outcomes</a> in elective CS before 39 weeks. If spontaneous labor occurs before the planned date of ERCD, these women could be encouraged to attempt TOLAC instead of emergency CS, because when labor spontaneously occurred before 40 weeks of gestation, the success rate of TOLAC was favorable.</p>

<img alt="" class="attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image" height="110" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2020/03/Figure-1_Flattening-the-Curve-140x110.jpg" style="display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;" width="140" /><p>Closure of schools and offices has wreaked havoc on families. The cancellation of airline flights, public events, social functions, and the disruption of our economy has been exasperating. We have been thrown into an era dominated by uncertainty, anxiety, and fear.</p>
<p>Are these measures truly necessary to mitigate the current COVID-19 pandemic? The answer is yes. With the lack of a preventive vaccine or definitive treatment for COVID-19, the only way to stop spread is by social distancing and “flattening the curve”. This previously unfamiliar expression is now part of the vernacular. Flattening the curve refers to reducing the number of cases to allow doctors, hospitals and government officials to function at their best without being overwhelmed. It is important to recognize that hospitals have only a finite number of rooms, ventilators and healthcare personnel.</p>
<p>The info-graphic below demonstrates why slowing the spread of the infection is nearly as important as stopping it. While shaped differently, the 2 bell-shaped curves below represent the same number of infected patients. The y-axis or peak of the bell indicates the daily number of cases and the x-axis indicates the time since the first case. The dotted line across the center represents the point at which too many cases in a short period of time will overwhelm the healthcare system.</p>
<p>A large number of people becoming severely ill with COVID-19 over a short period of time as shown in the tall, narrow curve, could result in a shortage of hospital beds, equipment or doctors. On the other hand, as shown in the flatter, longer curve, if the same number of patients presented to the hospital at a slower rate, the likelihood of the hospital to have adequate supplies, beds and health care providers would be higher (Figure 1).</p>
<img alt="" class="wp-image-11795 aligncenter" height="343" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2020/03/Figure-1_Flattening-the-Curve-300x166.jpg" width="620" />
<p>Therefore, in order to mitigate the impact of this pandemic, we need to keep the number of cases to below the dotted line. By doing so, we let our healthcare system function at its best. This also allows time for scientists and researchers to create drugs, therapies and potentially an efficacious vaccine against the virus.</p>
<p>An especially important factor to consider with respect to flattening the curve, is the necessity to keep our healthcare workers–physicians, nurses, and hospital staff–healthy and safe. With an increasing number of cases in the community, the potential for this workforce to get sick is much higher. If healthcare workers become sick, they will need to be excluded from patient care for many weeks. This effect of this is profound, as it will result in less healthcare workers and less qualified individuals available to take care of the sickest COVID-19 patients.</p>
<p>Social distancing may be our only hope to help flatten the curve and slow the spread of disease. Social distancing involves keeping a physical distance between people, at least 6 feet away, to avoid spread of the COVID-19 virus. This decreases the chances of acquisition of the virus and the disease. With the continued acceleration of this pandemic, no measure can be considered too drastic. The horrifying situation in Italy, wherein patients with COVID-19 have inundated the overburdened healthcare system, forcing doctors to make agonizing triage decisions about who should receive lifesaving care, should not be repeated in other countries.</p>
<p>School closures for the purpose of social distancing have especially impacted children and young families. Although current data suggests that children do not appear develop severe illness, it is well-documented that children can still spread the virus to their family members and contacts. Prior influenza pandemics have shown that the highest attack rates were seen in school children due to their close contact. Being separated from friends, can be difficult for children and especially teenagers. Social distancing does not mean social isolation. We can continue to interact using different platforms, such as social media and video applications to help them stay connected during this challenging time.</p>
<p>This is an unprecedented time and although social distancing may be thought to be a dramatic measure, in truth, together as a unified society, we can help slow down the spread of COVID-19. By staying home, you are not just protecting yourself but also other people. It’s the responsible thing to do and although challenging, will help us avoid a situation similar to that of Italy wherein war-like triage decisions and death has become a commonplace.</p>

<p><em>By</em> <a href="https://twitter.com/mattbwarren">Matthew Warren</a></p>
<p>The world is currently in an unprecedented state of upheaval and uncertainty. As countries fight to minimise the spread of COVID-19, everyone is adjusting to the “new normal”, remaining at home and practising social distancing. And the same is true of the psychologists whose work we report on every day at <em>Research Digest</em>: labs have been shut and experiments have suddenly been put on hold in the wake of the pandemic.</p>
<p>But many psychologists have also begun launching new research to understand how the present crisis is affecting us, and to inform our response to it. So this week, I’ve been talking to some of these researchers to find out more about their work.<span id="more-39388"></span></p>
<p><strong>Monitoring our mental health</strong></p>
<p>It’s clear that the new routines that we are now following are going to be necessary for quite some time. A new study led by social epidemiologist Daisy Fancourt is asking how people are responding to these changes in lifestyle.</p>
<p>We already know that our mental health can be affected by isolation, says Fancourt, and there’s never been a situation where so many people have been required to remain physically separated from others. “We’ve not really had something like this in living history,” she says.</p>
<p>To that end, the team is examining the trajectories of people’s mental health during the pandemic — and investigating what kinds of activities can help protect against the negative effects of isolation. Any UK resident over 18 can <a href="https://redcap.idhs.ucl.ac.uk/surveys/?s=TTXKND8JMK">sign-up online</a> and fill in an initial, 10 minute survey. Then, once a week, they will automatically get sent a follow-up questionnaire asking about their experiences of COVID-19, how they’ve been spending their time, and their physical and mental health.</p>
<p>By tracking a large number of participants over time, the team hopes to figure out what people can do at home to protect their mental health. They will release the findings regularly to the public and to the government and health authorities, beginning from next week. And they’re in it for the long haul, says Fancourt. “As long as this pandemic is going on, and we’re having these isolation measures, we want to make sure that there is a way that we’re tracking the experiences of people.”</p>
<p>Fancourt emphasises that it is crucial that people stay home — doing so will save lives. And there are activities known to be good for our mental health that we can already be doing, she adds: practising music and arts, for instance, or volunteering and providing support for others in the community.</p>
<p>Amy Orben from the University of Cambridge is part of another team planning a large, year-long study tracking the responses of adolescents and adults during the pandemic. The researchers, who are currently in discussion with funders, plan on tracking participants’ mood and mental health through the use of an app, which will send questions to their phones on a regular basis. Importantly, this app will also record behavioural data: what other apps people are using, for instance, and how long they are spending on their phones, as well as their movement and sleep patterns.</p>
<p>As in Fancourt’s study, the researchers hope the work will untangle how people’s activities relate to their mental health. They also plan on looking at how any events and announcements related to the pandemic affect participants’ responses. Orben says the team is keen to rapidly share data with the research community so that it can be analysed as quickly as possible.</p>
<p>For Orben, <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2020/01/28/episode-19-should-we-worry-about-screen-time/">whose research focuses on the psychological effects of media use</a>, one of the key questions will be how technology is being utilised in a time where face-to-face interaction is extremely limited. “I think it will allow us to move away from just thinking about time spent online and on screens to having more nuanced conversations about … what activities on screens are people actually engaging in,” she says. “Which ones of those are beneficial and help mitigate the effects of social isolation, and which ones might actually exacerbate stress?”</p>
<p><strong>Exploring messaging and behaviour </strong></p>
<p>Some researchers have already conducted preliminary research and published the results — as preprints, at least. Many of these studies have attempted to examine the value of different forms of public health messaging, or determine how people are behaving during the pandemic.</p>
<p>Take a <a href="https://psyarxiv.com/9yqs8">recent preprint</a> which surveyed more than 1,000 Americans across two days in March. The team, led by Jim Everett at the University of Kent and Molly Crocket at Yale University, looked at how moral messages could promote public health behaviours. Participants read a Facebook post urging people to stay at home, which was either accompanied by a “deontological” argument, telling people it was their duty to protect their community; a “utilitarian” argument, asking people to think of the negative consequences of not making these sacrifices now; an appeal to virtue, reminding people that staying home is what a good person would do; or no moral argument. They then indicated how likely they would be to adopt public health-related behaviours like washing their hands after getting home, or avoiding public gatherings.</p>
<p>Participants were more likely to indicate they would share the deontological message — the one that appealed to their sense of duty — than a post with no moral argument or a virtue-based one.  And there was some evidence that the deontological argument might increase people’s intentions to engage in health-related behaviours: participants reported a stronger intention to wash their hands after reading this message compared to the virtue-based one, for instance, although this effect did not reach statistical significance.</p>
<p>The study suggests that messages focused on citizens’ duties and responsibilities to others may be particularly useful. But the work is preliminary and there are important caveats: it only looks at people’s <em>intentions</em> rather than actual behaviour, and the effects are small and are not always significant. “What we’re very much <em>not</em> suggesting is that framing these judgments in more ‘deontological’ ways is unequivocally going to have huge impacts on behaviour,” acknowledges Everett. But still, the findings are consistent with past work, he says, adding that even interventions that produce small changes could, together, have an impact in the pandemic. The team is now working with other groups to see whether similar effects are found outside of the United States.</p>
<p>Researchers have also looked at how differences in personalities influence how likely we are to accept constraints to our quality of life (like social isolation) in order to protect ourselves or others from the virus. Ingo Zettler and colleagues from the University of Copenhagen <a href="https://psyarxiv.com/pkm2a/">have posted a preprint</a> based on a survey of 799 Danish citizens who completed personality questionnaires. Participants who scored higher on the so-called “Dark Factor” — which relates to people’s willingness to pursue their own interests at the expense of others — were less likely to accept these constraints. In contrast, those who scored higher on the trait of emotionality, who tend to be more anxious and empathetic, were more likely to follow them.</p>
<p>Other rapid studies have included research into <a href="https://psyarxiv.com/dz428">Americans’ perceptions of risk and behaviours</a> early on in the pandemic, how <a href="https://psyarxiv.com/y2cg5/">empathy relates to social distancing</a>, and the <a href="https://psyarxiv.com/epcyb/">“optimism bias”</a> when people consider the chance they will contract or pass on the virus. Again, it’s important to point out that most of this research consists of preprints which have not yet been peer-reviewed.</p>
<p><strong>Proceeding quickly… </strong></p>
<p>These studies represent just a snapshot of the work psychologists are conducting in the midst of the current crisis. J Nathan Matias from Cornell University and Alex Leavitt from Facebook Research have set up the <a href="https://github.com/natematias/covid-19-social-science-research">COVID-19 Social Science Research Tracker</a>, in which researchers can record details of projects they are working on. As of 26<sup>th</sup> March, more than 100 projects are listed, on everything from the spread of conspiracy theories to the effects of remote teaching on education.</p>
<p>The aim of the list is to help researchers who are planning studies find ways of working together and determine where they should be channelling their efforts, says Matias. The tracker will also ensure people are aware of new results as they become available.</p>
<p>Other networks are also getting involved in the response. The Psychological Science Accelerator, a network of labs which collaborate on large-scale studies, recently <a href="https://psysciacc.org/2020/03/21/join-the-psas-rapid-response-covid-19-project/">put out a call for “rapid and impactful studies”</a> to understand the psychological side of the pandemic. The group has decided to go ahead with three of the proposals, including a study that will examine the behavioural benefits of framing public health information in terms of gains (e.g. lives saved) rather than losses (e.g. deaths). Several journals have also joined <a href="http://neurochambers.blogspot.com/2020/03/calling-all-scientists-rapid-evaluation.html">an initiative calling for submissions of Registered Reports</a> on research related to COVID-19.</p>
<p>…<strong> but with caution</strong></p>
<p>While researchers conduct rapid research and stick preprints online, there’s another key effort that scientists can get involved in, says Matias: peer-review. “As we move quickly to organise the production of new knowledge, we absolutely need people who can take the time to look through those preprints … and get us to the point of verified knowledge in time for it to be useful,” he says. Orben echoes these concerns: “Just because things are urgent doesn’t mean they shouldn’t be scrutinised.” That scrutiny itself will need to become more instantaneous, she adds. Many journals, including the <em><a href="https://twitter.com/lauragesmith/status/1240712219731558402/photo/1">British Journal of Social Psychology</a> </em>and the <a href="https://twitter.com/BPSOfficial/status/1242892821629153280?s=20"><em>British Journal of Health Psychology</em></a> are already promising expedited peer review of papers related to the pandemic.</p>
<p>Some psychologists have stressed that it’s also important this rapid response is informed by past work, whether that consists of studies into outbreaks specifically, or just well-grounded psychological science more generally. “The first rule of preventing harm is learning from what’s been done before,” <a href="https://twitter.com/vaughanbell/status/1241991708436504577?s=20">tweeted Vaughan Bell recently</a>. “If it’s urgent, the urgency is to do it right”.</p>
<p>And although many researchers are able to conduct psychological research in the midst of a pandemic, Matias emphasises that not everyone is in a position to do so.  “A lot of people have been impacted themselves in ways that make it difficult to continue research. And that’s okay,” he says.</p>
<p>For those who do have the time or means to do so, however, it can be rewarding. “It’s easy to feel quite helpless at the moment,” says Everett. “I’m really glad I’m doing it – it makes me feel like I am perhaps able to contribute in some small part”.</p>

<p>Around 2.6 million babies a year are stillborn. Although it’s always devastating to lose a baby,  parents grieving for a stillborn child are more likely to experience depression and post-traumatic stress than those when the child had been born alive.  There is considerable stigma, social shame and marginalization associated with parental grief for a stillborn child with the result that it has attracted little attention by health care providers, resulting in inadequate support.</p>
<blockquote><p>Parents grieving for a stillborn child are more likely to experience depression and post-traumatic stress than those when the child had been born alive.</p></blockquote>
<p>Farrales et al. recently ran a qualitative participatory research study to explore the experiences of bereaved parents when interacting with health care providers during and after the stillbirth of their child.Results showed was that both mothers and fathers needed acknowledgement from their health care provider that the baby was a irreplaceable individual in its own right, recognized that they were parents that were grieving, recognized how traumatic stillbirth is and recognition that the parents will continue to feel bereaved for a time and that they needed support.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.cocites.com/">CoCites</a> was developed by Janssens et al. at <a href="http://www.emory.edu/home/index.html">Emory University</a>. Unlike many other tools for searching though the scientific literature, CoCites uses citations rather than keywords. It has been designed to be more efficient than the traditional keyword-based methods and works on the assumption that the user knows at least one highly relevant article within their chosen research area, pulling out all articles that have previously been cited together.</p>

<p>The article describes the results of using CoCites to reproduce the literature searches of a number of published systematic reviews and meta-analyses; these showed that CoCites retrieved a median of 75% of the articles that were included in the original reviews.</p>

<p>People who play sports are often faced  with a dilemma when they are injured. Should they continue playing or stop. Until now, the implications of playing sport when injured on both joint health and health-related quality of life (HRQoL) has not been investigated. With this in mind, Bullock et al. performed research on the relationship between playing while injured, HRQoL, osteoarthritis and persistent joint pain, comparing findings across both elite and recreational cricket players. The study involved asking participates to fill in a questionnaire describing their history <img alt="" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-11777" height="255" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2020/03/cricket-724617_1920-300x255.jpg" width="300" />of playing sport while injured and details on any diagnosed osteoarthritis and/or persistent joint pain. It was found that, indeed, cricketers who played injured had their HRQoL adversely affected and were at increased risk of osteoarthritis and joint pain. The authors conclude that the long-term impact of playing while injured should be considered when advising athletes on their ability to compete following an injury.</p>

<p>There is evidence to suggest that parents from more socioeconomically disadvantaged backgrounds interact verbally with their children less than parents from more advantaged background, resulting in what has been coined “the 30 million-word gap”. Brushe et al. decided to explore this further, investigating the number of worlds children hear in their first year of life and whether this is influenced by the level of education attained by the mother. The five year study involved grouping the mothers into high or low education groups and then collecting data from audio-recordings when the children were 6 months old and again when they were a year old.  The number of words spoken by the mothers when they were talking to their children were counted using the Language Environment Analysis software. Results showed that there was a large variation of words spoken by the mother within each education group, but no meaningful differences between the different educational groups. This suggests that a word gap associated with the level of education attained by the mother is not apparent in the first year of a child’s life.</p>

<p><i>By</i> <a href="https://emmayoung.net/">Emma Young</a></p>
<p>You’ll probably be familiar with the idea of behavioural “nudges” — interventions that encourage people to make better choices, without changing the actual options available. As a concept, nudging has become hugely popular, with at least 200 “nudge units” in governments and institutions around the world. We’ve certainly reported on a few studies finding that simple nudges <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2019/09/03/giving-people-simple-moral-nudges-encourages-them-to-donate-much-more-to-charity/">encourage people to give more to charity</a>, and <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2019/09/19/simply-changing-the-order-of-fast-food-menus-nudges-customers-towards-healthier-soft-drink-choices/">help people to make healthier soft drink choices from fast food menus</a>, for example. You might be forgiven for thinking, then, that there are no limits to what nudging can do….</p>
<p>Well, a recent <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41562-019-0795-z">set of studies</a> designed to “nudge” commuters’ behaviour, published in <em>Nature Human Behaviour </em>and involving a total of almost 69,000 people, has found that there definitely are limits. “The failure of these well-powered experiments … highlights both the difficulty of changing commuter behaviour and the importance of publishing null results to build cumulative knowledge about how to encourage sustainable travel,” write Ariella S. Kristal and Ashley V. Whillans, of Harvard Business School.</p>
<p><span id="more-39383"></span></p>
<p>The participants were employees of a major European airport. About half had reported driving by themselves to and from work. But almost 60% of this group said they would consider carpooling, and 41% said that finding a “matched” person with a similar commute to carpool with was a key reason why they weren’t already doing it. Many employees also reported that if they were given discounts on public transport, they’d be more likely to use it. The airport did already have a carpool service, and was also well connected to subway, rail and bus infrastructure. It seemed, then, like the ideal place to nudge people towards commuter behaviours that would benefit their own health and pocket, as well as, of course, the environment.</p>
<p>In the first experiment, Kristal and Whillans tested a letter and email campaign designed to encourage employees to sign up for carpooling by highlighting the benefits and providing testimonials from carpoolers. Though this intervention did increase registrants, this increase was tiny, and, statistically, it made absolutely no difference to the numbers who actually used the service. (For this study, the researchers sent out 15,000 letters. Only 33 employees registered for the service as a result. One month later, only three who’d received the initial letter were active carpoolers.)</p>
<p>For the second study, they gave employees details of good personal carpooling matches, and reminded them that carpooling would save them money. (Remember, a lack of knowledge about someone suitable to carpool with was reported in initial surveys as a key barrier to doing it.) But  again, this intervention did not increase carpooling behaviour.</p>
<p>Next, they tried giving a different group of more than 7,000 employees a free one-week bus trial. But this intervention failed to subsequently increase registration for discounted bus passes.</p>
<p>In the fourth experiment, the pair provided just over 1,000 employees with comprehensive personalised travel plans. These plans included information about carpooling matches, bus and train routes and times, transit pass discounts and bike routes. These employees were also offered a one-on-one session with the airport commuter team to talk this through. Only 21 people signed up for these sessions. And, overall, the intervention made no difference whatsoever to the participants’ commuter behaviour.</p>
<p>There is one significant limitation to the study that the researchers themselves point out: this particular airport offers employees a free parking space. Perhaps these attempted nudges would have had more impact on people who have to pay for their parking.</p>
<p>However, they do draw a few cautionary conclusions from their findings. One: the work “suggests that people do not always reveal their true intentions or barriers to sustainable commuting.” Though many had initially said that they <em>would</em> carpool or use public transport if they had discounted travel, this isn’t what transpired. Further work will be needed to investigate exactly why this is (maybe they don’t really want to talk to co-workers during the commute, for example). But it does seem that nudges aren’t enough to change commuter behaviours. Heavier-handed policies, such as congestion charges and parking bans, may be necessary to bring about shifts in this type of behaviour, the researchers write.</p>
<p>More broadly, though, they think the findings also suggest that nudges might not be that effective at changing habitual behaviours, in general.</p>
<p>An accompanying <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41562-020-0832-y">editorial</a> in the journal welcomes the publication of this paper. Though the majority of studies reporting nudge interventions have found them to be successful, given the known problem of bias towards publishing positive results, “it’s possible that many more unsuccessful interventions exist but have never been reported,” the editorial observes. And clearly, this is an example of a case where null results have policy implications.</p>
<p>Finally, the editorial notes, “the study points to the limits of nudges and reminds us that they are not a panacea. While they can be a low-cost and simple way to shift many behaviours, it’s important to remember that not all behaviours are equally easy to shift.”</p>

<p><em>By </em><a href="http://emilyoliviareynolds.com/">Emily Reynolds</a></p>
<p>Our relationship with our parents can have a big impact on our life trajectory. Research has found that those of us <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2019/12/04/lying-to-your-kids-could-make-them-more-dishonest-and-less-well-adjusted-as-adults/">lied to by</a> caregivers often end up less well-adjusted, that <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2017/04/11/is-your-work-ethic-rooted-in-the-quality-of-the-relationship-you-had-with-your-parents/">hard workers</a> are more likely to produce children with good work ethics, that cognitive skills can be improved by having <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2019/06/04/largest-observational-study-of-its-kind-finds-talkative-parents-have-kids-with-better-cognitive-skills-but-its-not-clear-why/">talkative parents</a>, and that <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2017/12/15/positive-parenting-gets-under-the-skin-showing-up-years-later-in-the-cortisol-response/">positive parenting</a> can impact cortisol levels even years later.</p>
<p>But though we might pay less attention to it, how parents relate to one another is also important for children’s long-term development. A new study, published in <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs13524-019-00851-w"><em>Demography</em></a><em>, </em>has taken a look at affection within parental relationships, finding that loving spousal relationships can have a positive long-term impact on children’s life paths.</p>
<p><span id="more-39379"></span>The researchers focused on Nepal, which they say provides an interesting backdrop for an investigation into marriage. Marriage has changed significantly in the country over the last few years: marrying for love (as opposed to arranged marriage) is now more common than it used to be, and rates of divorce and premarital cohabitation are also increasing in the country, though remain rare.</p>
<p>Data was gathered from a longitudinal study, where marital relationship quality and the educational and personal progress of children were tracked for twelve years. The first set of data was collected from 151 neighborhoods in the Western Chitwan Valley in 1996. The quality of relationships among married participants was measured by asking partners separately how much they loved their husband or wife on a three-point scale, and participants were also asked whether their spouse had ever beaten them.</p>
<p>To look at how parents’ relationships influenced children’s own marriage behaviour, the researchers then tracked the age at which children married over the next 10 years. In 2008, they also re-interviewed participants, asking mothers whether or not their children had dropped out of school, and if so at what age.</p>
<p>The results suggested that marriage quality was in fact associated with children’s educational prospects. Children with parents who reported greater love for each other were less likely to drop out of school, whilst those whose parents reported less love were more likely to stop education. Children with parents who reported spousal violence were also more likely to drop out.</p>
<p>Educational outcomes were also related to both class and ethnicity: children from ethnic groups with higher social status, from wealthier households, or whose parents had higher educational backgrounds were more likely to remain in education. The relationship between marriage quality and children’s life outcomes was still significant after controlling for these factors.</p>
<p>Children’s own marriage timing was also linked to levels of their parents’ spousal love: the more positive the parental relationship, the later children got married. It’s important to note that in the context of the study, this was considered to be a good thing — in Nepal, later marriage can imply a better match, and that children feel less need to leave the family home at any cost.</p>
<p>So, as expected, the quality of parents’ marriages had a significant impact on their children, both in terms of educational attainment and on their own relationships later in life. However, the findings may not bear out in the rest of the world, where other cultural factors may come into play. There may also have been nuances that were missed in the measures. For instance, participants were asked only about instances of <em>extreme</em> conflict between spouses; conflicts or abuse may have occurred that were more subtle or less extreme than domestic violence, but that had an impact on children nonetheless. Similarly, educational attainment was measured only by when children dropped out of school, failing to take into consideration what students did after leaving school or the grades they achieved.</p>
<p>Limitations aside, the results do pose an interesting question about how spousal relationships impact children. It’s understandable that parents spend much of their time focusing on their interactions with their children — but looking at the way they feel about their partner may be just as useful.</p>

<p><i>By</i> <a href="https://emmayoung.net/">Emma Young</a></p>
<p>When a musician is playing a piece, and the audience is enjoying it, they can develop physical synchronies. Both might tap their feet, sway their bodies, or clap their hands. “Through music, the producer and the perceiver connect emotionally and behaviourally,” note the authors of a <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1053811920301427?dgcid=rss_sd_all">new paper</a>, published in <em>NeuroImage</em>. And now this team, led by Yingying Hou at East China Normal University, has uncovered a connection right down at the neural level. The team has observed “inter-brain coherence” (IBC) — a synchronisation in brain activity — between a musician and the audience. What’s more, the strength of this coherence could be used to predict how much the audience enjoyed a piece.</p>
<p><span id="more-39376"></span>The team used a technique called near-infrared spectroscopy to monitor the brain activity of a professional violinist while he was videoed playing a series of 12 brief, classical pieces. They then used the same technique (which involves shining beams of light through the skull, to monitor changes in blood flow) on 16 women while they watched the video, and listened to all of these pieces. (Because gender differences in inter-brain synchronisation have previously been observed, only women were recruited as listeners.)</p>
<p>The violinist had been instructed to look directly at the camera and maintain a neutral expression while he played the pieces, which each lasted about 100 seconds. If he was enjoying one piece more than another, the team hoped this would not be obvious to the viewers. They were told to gaze at the violinist’s face while they listened. After each piece, they rated how much they liked it on a seven-point scale.</p>
<p>The data revealed inter-brain coherence between each of the listeners and the musician, for all of the violin pieces. That is, there were similar patterns of heightened activity in certain key regions of the brain while the violinist played and the other participants listened.</p>
<p>The key regions included the left temporal cortex (which is thought to focus on processing the rhythm of sound information), the right inferior frontal cortex and the postcentral cortices. These two latter regions have been highlighted as important hubs of a hypothesised mirror system that allows a sender and receiver to share brain representations. “In the present study, the frontoparietal mirror neuron system allows audiences to experience or comprehend the mind of the performer as if they were to ‘walk in another’s shoes’,” the researchers believe.</p>
<p>The team also produced an average IBC score for each piece of music, and compared these with the listeners’ averaged liking scores for each piece. They found clear correlations. The more popular pieces were marked by stronger inter-brain coherence in the left temporal cortex between the audience as a whole and the performer.</p>
<p>The team also reported that the link between level of coherence and popularity only developed during the second half of each piece. This could be because there are two stages to music appreciation, they suggest. The first stage involves recognising rhythms, and identifying the potential musical structure of a piece. During the next stage, the listener develops aesthetic judgements and experiences emotional resonance, and generates stronger predictions about the sounds that ‘should’ follow. “If the expectation matches the incoming information, the musical performance will be experienced as pleasant,” the team thinks.</p>
<p>More work will be needed to explain why the coherence-liking effect only emerged at a group level, and to explore whether the results obtained here will also apply to other types of musical instrument, and other genres. The team also note that the near-infrared technique only allowed them to look at blood flow in the cortex, not other deeper areas that might be involved in the response to music production and perception, too, such as limbic structures. Also, by design, this study only involved women. Whether men will respond in the same way is unknown.</p>
<p>Still, it’s fascinating research. “This study expands our understanding of music appreciation,” the researchers write, adding: “The results can potentially be applied to the development of brain indices for predicting public attitudes towards various musical performances.”</p>

                <h4><a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/620217952/0/oupblogpsychology/">The story of COVID-19, by the numbers</a></h4>

<p>The <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://www.who.int/dg/speeches/detail/who-director-general-s-opening-remarks-at-the-media-briefing-on-covid-19---11-march-2020">COVID-19 pandemic</a> was announced on 11 March 2020 by the World Health Organization, marking a turning point for the public health systems serving the health of constituent populations across the globe. This declaration moment is important for narrative on COVID-19 because it is the point at which it is accepted that the virus is not only travelling to different countries, but is now circulating in those countries. Governments are now required to take action to moderate the impact of the infection, reducing harm for the polity until the virus – through the mutation of its biological properties, human immunity, vaccines or some combination of these – takes its place, we hope, among the many other microbes with which human life has found co-existence.</p><p>The WHO declaration is also an important moment for the COVID-19 story because it reveals how data about notifications of diagnosed infection and deaths are used to make decisions and therefore reveals how, in the circumstances of a pandemic, it is keenly apparent that numerical and narrative futures constitute each other.</p><p>Pandemics are narrated into meaningful existence and COVID-19 is no exception. In Australia, for instance, news stories on the novel coronavirus have escalated since January 2020 to become headlined on many broadcast and digital news platforms. This pattern of media interest conforms to what has been seen in previous outbreaks. Swine flu in 2009 was a significant media event that did not go unremarked in the interviews and focus groups I and colleagues conducted with members of the general population variously impacted by the pandemic threat. Ebola, too, was a prominent news story in 2014 as was Zika in the run up to the Olympics in Rio de Janeiro  in 2016.</p><p>COVID-19 resembles these other outbreaks and pandemics, but the news stories about it seem to have a distinctively numerical quality. The number of known infections in a particular place over a period of time gives an index of the transmissibility of an infection. Mortality rates – a measure of the proportion of people that die with an infection – are also woven into pandemic stories, in general. But COVID-19’s numbers seem to <em>be</em> its story. News feeds continually update the counts of diagnoses and deaths, and have numerically tracked the contagion from a supposed source in China to other countries, notably South Korea, Iran and Italy, and then to most other parts of the world. This pandemic by numbers approach charts the particular transmissibility and severity of this virus, but also lends itself to our increasingly complex small-screen media diet, where numbers and graphs alongside images and videos more easily convey the COVID-19 story than do long form narrative texts.</p><p>COVID-19 also comes into a context where public health systems have increasingly turned to mathematical models to make decisions about how to manage various infections, notably HIV and influenza. Models are used to decide how to apply resources and strategies to best effect. For example, modelling has shown how HIV can be prevented by HIV treatments, because they reduce the likelihood of the transmission of the virus. For influenza, models are used to calculate what proportion of the population needs to be vaccinated to protect the whole population from an emerging infection. These models can be adjusted to fit what is known about the biosocial properties of a particular infection, the efficacy of treatments and vaccines, and cost. In the case of COVID-19, for example, models may be indicating that containment will reduce the speed and scope of transmission and therefore reduce mortality, the burden on the health system, and ultimately the cost for governments. COVID-19 may be a fully-fledged algorithmic pandemic in the sense that its storyline is transparently about its numbers and because it is managed in terms of the models that combine numerical indices of transmission, mortality, burden, and cost.</p><p>Mathematical models and narratives also have a point of contact in relation to futures and pasts: they both offer means of trying to shape what might happen through action in the present guided by understandings of what has happened. Decision-makers want to know how to act now to reduce the future impact of a pandemic and models support these decisions by analysing pre-existing data about transmission, mortality, the benefits and costs of treatments, vaccines and containment, for example. Modelling, then, looks to what the future might be by assessing a pandemic’s past numbers. This is strictly true even during the course of a particular pandemic. Narratives on pandemic futures also recall the past, for example, through reference to the 1918-1919 influenza pandemic, swine flu in 2009, and other outbreaks, and on that basis orient the narrator and their interlocutors to possible futures. Public policy statements about containment requirements and news media vision of empty supermarket shelves both reflect action in the present that is predicated on pasts and aims to shape futures.</p><p>For all its life threatening, anxiety-making potential, though, the numerical narrative on COVID-19 is surprisingly impersonal. Stories of the many lives affected by the pandemic and the full tenor of its corporeal horrors are crowded out by governmental advice and updating of the numbers. One reason for this separation of pandemic knowing and lived experience is their incommensurability. Pandemics are constituted in the sheer scale and spread of their numbers, so much so that no one person can experience a pandemic without recourse to some signification of this calculated, collective plight. Infections, in contrast, are visceral and personal, including for those who devote themselves to providing care. Moreover, narrative arguably meets its limits in the experience of an infection because, like traumatic experience, living through a debilitating one is not an easy story to tell. Some accounts of how people experienced the 1918-1919 pandemic remark on the lack of affect, giving the impression that emotion was bracketed aside as irresponsible, impossible or even a luxury.</p><p>Numerical narrative, then, may not only be one of the ways we can know a pandemic is happening; it may provide the means of living with emerging threat. As they say, time – and numbers – will tell how things turn out for COVID-19.</p><p><em>Featured Image Credit: “people walking on train station” by Liliya Lisa.

                <h4><a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/620131832/0/oupblogpsychology/">How olive oil promotes brain health</a></h4>

<p>Diets and superfoods are all the rage. From acai berries to the Zone diet, many a dietary trend has come along promising a range of benefits, such as weight loss, heart health, and improved cognition. But the science behind these claims is often sketchy at best. One dietary regime that has stood the test of time – and importantly, <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/5-studies-on-the-mediterranean-diet">scientific scrutiny</a> – is the Mediterranean diet. Earlier this year, U.S. News and World Report named the Mediterranean diet as <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://health.usnews.com/wellness/food/articles/how-us-news-ranks-best-diets">the best diet of 2020</a> for the third year in a row. The diets were scored by a panel of nationally recognized experts in diet and nutrition. In second place was another consistent high performer in the rankings, the DASH diet (DASH stands for dietary approaches to stop hypertension) which focuses on lowering blood pressure.</p><p>If you are on a DASH diet or the Mediterranean diet you are probably eating fruits, vegetables, and low-fat dairy foods, as well as whole-grain foods, fish, poultry, and nuts.  You are also probably consuming olive oil as a substitute for unhealthy vegetable or coconut oils.  Olive Oil, particularly the extra virgin preparation, contains lots of antioxidants (just look at that rich color; it screams anti-oxidants) and also has significant anti-Inflammatory properties. Everyone knows that these are the two most important properties of healthy foods.</p><p>Your body clearly benefits from eating olive oil. Does your brain care?</p><p>Answering this question is not easy. First of all, olive oil is a complex blend of various chemicals. It would be nice to know which of these is most advantageous and whether they influence brain health directly or indirectly. A recent study attempted to find answers using an animal model that mimics conditions of multiple sclerosis in the human brain. Multiple sclerosis is characterized by brain inﬂammation leading to numerous degenerative changes.</p><p>The brain inflammation present in multiple sclerosis patients is thought to be driven by changes in the gut microbiome. Scientists now understand that the gut microbiome plays a signiﬁcant role in both the progression and severity of the disease. This is the likely scenario: an imbalance in the gut bacteria leads to inflammation, chemical debris released from the bacteria migrate out of the gut into the blood and then into the brain. The most harmful of these bacterial debris is called lipopolysaccharide and it can induce a powerful inflammatory response inside the brain. People with multiple sclerosis have elevated levels of lipopolysaccharide in their brains, spinal cords, and blood.</p><p>Olive oil modifies how your gut microbiome communicates with your brain. Olive oil’s beneficial effects on the human brain and body are likely related to the presence of the polyphenols hydroxytyrosol and oleic acid. Hydroxytyrosol protects cells that are under oxidative stress. Oleic acid has beneficial effects on blood cholesterol levels.</p><p>One recent <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://doi.org/10.1080/1028415X.2018.1469281">study</a> of olive oil demonstrated potent anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects. Administering olive oil animals significantly reduced the number of harmful chemicals that can cause tissue injury and aging, particularly within the brain. Olive oil administration also increased levels of the enzymes that provide protection against oxidative damage in the brain and also reduces the negative actions the lipopolysaccharide released by bacteria in the gut. Olive oil also reduced the level of inflammation in the brain.</p><p>So, yes, your brain benefits a lot from adding olive oil to your diet and these benefits originate in response to the changes that olive oil makes to your gut microbiome. Olive oil should become a big part of the diet for anyone with an aging brain.</p><p><em>Featured Image Credit: Photo by Steve Buissinne from <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://pixabay.com/photos/olive-oil-salad-dressing-cooking-968657/">Pixabay</a></em></p><p>The post <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://blog.oup.com/2020/03/how-olive-oil-promotes-brain-health/">How olive oil promotes brain health</a> appeared first on <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://blog.oup.com">OUPblog</a>.</p><img align="left" border="0" height="1" hspace="0" src="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/i/620131832/0/oupblogpsychology" style="border: 0; float: left; margin: 0; padding: 0; width: 1px!important; height: 1px!important;" width="1" /><div style="clear: both; padding-top: 0.2em;"><a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/2/620131832/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/fbshare20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/28/620131832/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/fblike20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/30/620131832/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/googleplus20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/16/620131832/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/linkedin20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/29/620131832/oupblogpsychology,"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/pinterest20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/1/620131832/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/reddit20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/24/620131832/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/twitter20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/19/620131832/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/email20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/20/620131832/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/rss20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a><h3 style="clear: left; padding-top: 10px;">Related Stories</h3><ul><li><a href="https://blog.oup.com/2020/04/the-surprising-scientific-value-of-national-bias/" rel="nofollow">The surprising scientific value of national bias</a></li><li><a href="https://blog.oup.com/2020/03/seven-books-on-the-fascinating-human-brain-reading-list/" rel="nofollow">Seven books on the fascinating human brain [reading list]</a></li><li><a href="https://blog.oup.com/2020/03/how-to-rate-and-rank-potential-doctoral-students/" rel="nofollow">How to rate and rank potential doctoral students</a></li></ul> </div>

<p><strong>The 2020 World Happiness Report has been published by the United Nations Sustainable Development Solutions Network, with Finland ranking as the world’s happiest country. “</strong>Happiness” in the report doesn’t refer to the expression of emotion <em>per se</em>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/20/world/europe/world-happiness-report.html">writes Maria Cramer</a> at the <em>New York Times</em>, but is rather about a sense of satisfaction in life and belief that members of one’s community care for each other — a particularly poignant definition given present circumstances.<span id="more-39371"></span></p>

<p><strong>An imaging technique adapted from geophysics could provide a new way of looking at the human brain, </strong><a href="https://physicsworld.com/a/seismic-imaging-technology-sees-deep-inside-the-brain/">reports Ian Randall</a> at <em>Physics World</em>. Researchers have traditionally been unable to scan the brain using ultrasound, as the waves are scattered by the skull. But now a team have shown that ultrasound <em>can</em> be used to record signals from inside the skull, with the help of a method normally used to construct images from below the surface of the Earth based on seismometer recordings.</p>

<p><strong>Researchers have developed an AI capable of smelling certain odours</strong>, <a href="https://www.newscientist.com/article/2237534-ai-can-pick-out-specific-odours-from-a-combination-of-smells/">reports Gege Li</a> at <em>New Scientist.</em> Chemical sensors respond to particular odours in the environment, and an algorithm then uses that pattern of response to identify the smell, similar to the processes used by the mammalian olfactory bulb.</p>

<p><strong>It’s a myth that autistic people aren’t social</strong>, <a href="https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/beautiful-minds/autistic-people-make-great-social-partners-if-you-actually-give-them-a-chance/">writes Scott Barry Kaufmann</a> at <em>Scientific American</em>. Negative impressions about the social life of autistic people are driven by the biases of others –— including researchers.</p>

<p>Open Access and Open Science are critical, especially in times of crisis. The COVID-19 outbreak shows how important it is for medical professionals, scientific experts, and every member of the public to have immediate access to the latest science. Equal access to the latest research can assuage public fears or spur government action. Today, we’re happy to report that <em>PLOS ONE</em> published its first COVID-19 paper since we started <a href="https://blogs.plos.org/plos/2020/01/novel-coronavirus-2019-ncov-outbreak/">fast-tracking submissions on January 31</a><a href="https://blogs.plos.org/plos/2020/01/novel-coronavirus-2019-ncov-outbreak/"><sup>st</sup></a>.</p>
<p>Science leaders have <a href="https://wellcome.ac.uk/sites/default/files/covid19-open-access-letter.pdf">recently requested</a> that the publishing community make their content open and re-usable. PLOS <a href="https://wellcome.ac.uk/press-release/publishers-make-coronavirus-covid-19-content-freely-available-and-reusable">already supports</a>, and calls on others to support, COVID-19 research being shared such that it can be centrally text- and data-mined, and also versioned in places where it can be most conveniently discovered by those tackling this crisis in real time. We always push <u>all </u>PLOS content to PubMed Central.</p>
<p><a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0230548">The study</a> was conducted by Mingli Yuan and colleagues from the Central Hospital of Wuhan, Hubei province, China. The researchers studied 27 patients infected with COVID-19 and admitted to the Central Hospital of Wuhan. In this patient group, the authors associated clinical features identified from computed tomography (CT) scans of patients’ lungs with eventual outcomes. They scored patients based on features they observed such as ground glass opacity, abnormality on both sides, and widespread distribution of pathology in the lungs, to produce an overall severity score for each patient.</p>
<p>Dr Yuan adds: “This study allows us to compare radiologic findings with the mortality of patients infected with COVID-19.”</p>
<p>Since February 1<sup>st</sup>, PLOS’ family of journals have received approximately 175 coronavirus-related submissions. This paper had a turnaround time of less than 21 days from submission to acceptance. A fast, open and transparent process of publishing reliable, peer reviewed science <em>and </em>its underlying data is an important contribution towards tackling this outbreak, and we are happy to make contributions to this effort. We are forwarding all of our submissions to the World Health Organization for their <a href="https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/global-research-on-novel-coronavirus-2019-ncov">database of publications on coronavirus disease (COVID-19)</a>.</p>

<p><i>By</i> <a href="https://emmayoung.net/">Emma Young</a></p>
<p>Adults are vulnerable to all kinds of body illusions. We can be made to feel that a<a href="https://thepsychologist.bps.org.uk/volume-27/edition-3/interview-people-have-been-ignoring-body-long-time"> fake hand, or even a fake body, is our own; that we’ve left our body; even that we’re the size of a doll</a>. These illusions work because our brains use information from various senses to create mental representations of our bodies. Mess with some of these sensory signals, and you can alter those representations, sometimes drastically.</p>
<p>Work to date suggests that young children don’t show the same susceptibilities to body illusions, presumably because the systems that underpin them are still developing. Now a <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-59979-0">new study</a>, published in <em>Scientific Reports</em>, has found that a bizarre auditory-induced illusion that affects adults doesn’t work in quite the same way in young kids, either.</p>
<p><span id="more-39359"></span><a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2011/10/28/how-listening-to-an-ipod-shrinks-your-sense-of-personal-space/">Ana Tajadura-Jiménez</a>, now at Charles III University of in Madrid, has led all kinds of fascinating work showing that body illusions can be triggered through the manipulation of sound. Take her “<a href="http://magicshoes.es/the-team/">magic shoes</a>“, for example. Microphones record the sound of the wearer walking. But this sound is then filtered, so only the the higher-pitched portions are played on to them, through earphones. This has the effect of making the wearer sound lighter, which leads them to report <em>feeling</em> lighter and more sprightly.</p>
<p>For the new study, Elena Nava at the University of Milano-Bicocca and Tajadura-Jiménez turned to what’s known as the “auditory Pinocchio illusion”. In earlier work, Tajadura-Jiménez and colleagues had found that if adults pull up on their index finger while listening to brief sounds of rising pitch, they have the feeling that their finger is getting longer. Why? Other research has found that we associate a “high” pitch with a high position in physical space, and so, Tajadura-Jiménez suspects, this metaphor is influencing our perceptions. Like adults, even babies get the “high” vs “low” pitch metaphor — so perhaps young children would experience this illusion, too. But when the pair tried a version of it on a group of 30 four- to six-year-olds, and on a group of 30 adults, they found some differences between the responses of the two groups.</p>
<p>For this study, the participants didn’t pull on their own fingers. Rather, they pressed their palm up against a vertical wooden surface, and their hand was screened with a cloth, so they couldn’t see it. An experimenter then repeatedly either pulled or pressed on their middle finger while they heard a tone that ascended in pitch, descended in pitch or remained constant.</p>

<p>Each time, the participant used a scale on the side of the board to indicate where they felt the tip of their middle finger to be in space. They were also asked about whether they <em>perceived</em> their finger to be getting longer, shrinking, or staying the same length.</p>
<p>The team found that when ascending notes were played during finger-pulling, adults indicated that their middle finger tip was higher (and so the finger was longer) than it actually was.</p>
<p>Children, on the other hand, did not indicate that their finger tip was higher during these ascending notes — and yet like the adults, they reported <em>feeling</em> that their finger was getting longer.</p>
<p>This suggests that by around the age of four to six, a child’s thoughts and feelings about what’s happening to its body — its “body image” — is adult-like (at least, in this context). However, its unconscious body “schema” — the brain’s map of the body in space — is not yet being calibrated in the same way as an adult’s.</p>
<p>Interestingly, the researchers did not find that tones of descending pitch played while the finger was being pressed made adults or children think that their finger was getting smaller. “Why can the brain ‘accept’ a longer finger but not a shorter one?” the researchers ask. “This asymmetry could reflect the fact that the brain experiences, throughout development, the enlargement of most parts of the body, while it never experiences shrinkage,” they suggest.</p>
<p>In a subsequent study, the pair then tried a version of the same experiment, but with the participants’ arms and hands positioned horizontally, rather than vertically. In this orientation, the longer finger effect that they had just found in adults was not repeated. As the high/low metaphor for pitch is vertical in nature, not horizontal, this “supports our hypothesis that crossmodal ‘metaphoric’ correspondences influence the binding of multisensory information,” the researchers write.</p>

<p>They would now like to see further work to establish when a child’s body map becomes adult-like, and also to explore whether individual differences in the way signals from various senses are integrated might predict our susceptibilities to body illusions.</p>

                <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/~r/plos/Blog/~3/kLhMdRBiCSg/">A message to our community regarding COVID-19</a></h4>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By Joerg Heber, Editorial Director, PLOS and Editor-in-Chief, <em>PLOS ONE</em></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As the global research community, along with everyone else, adopts measures to slow the spread of the coronavirus, we wanted to update you on how we are dealing with the situation at PLOS.</span></p>
<h3><b>PLOS Operations</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you have a paper in process at any PLOS journal, it is being processed as normal. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We are conscious of the challenges that many of you face during this crisis. We will remain supportive and flexible, which may affect individual paper processing times (more below). We are also carefully monitoring the health and well-being of our staff, managing and coordinating workloads, and supporting each other with flexibility. While the situation is far from normal in both of our primary locations (USA and UK), at this point we do not anticipate issues preventing the efficient publishing of our seven journals. We are facilitating the prompt evaluation of any papers related to the coronavirus and resulting pandemic, and all other papers are also being handled as per our standard processes. </span></p>
<h3><b>Reassurance for Our Research Communities</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We understand that the global research community is significantly but also variably affected by this pandemic, and so we want to provide the following clarifications and reassurance:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To Authors</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">We are flexible regarding turnaround times for revisions and other tasks during this stressful time. Please keep in touch with us if you need any extensions or if you experience any challenges around manuscript preparation; we will work with you.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">We are fast-tracking all relevant research related to the coronavirus and resulting pandemic, and are processing all other submissions as normal.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">We are forwarding all submissions and papers related to the outbreak to the World Health Organization for their </span><a href="https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/global-research-on-novel-coronavirus-2019-ncov"><span style="font-weight: 400;">database </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">of publications on coronavirus.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">We encourage all researchers to also consider posting a </span><a href="https://plos.org/open-science/preprints/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Preprint</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Please remember that – across all our journals – we protect primary research studies from being considered “scooped” by closely related, parallel studies recently published in other journals. So, there is no need to rush your research, or revisions, for the sake of being selected for novelty!</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To Reviewers</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you have agreed to do a review, or would like to do a review, for a PLOS journal but need extra time, please just let us know. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you can, please review </span><a href="https://connect.biorxiv.org/relate/content/181"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Preprints related to coronavirus</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> directly via the preprint’s commenting options or on the </span><a href="https://outbreaksci.prereview.org/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rapid PreReview server</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">  — this can speed up the review process down the line, as constructive comments may be vetted and used in a review process at a journal (read about PLOS’ </span><a href="https://blogs.plos.org/plos/2019/11/community-comments-and-peer-review-a-preprint-commenting-pilot-at-plos/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">initiative</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">) or authors can respond rapidly to comments made</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">In light of the now-limited resources for experimental research due to closed laboratories, we encourage you to carefully consider the need for additional experiments or analyses in revision requests, especially if the conclusions are adequately supported by the data. (Note: while we recommend this for all journals during this crisis, this is always standard practice at PLOS ONE and simply a reminder in this case.)</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To Editors</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thank you for your continued support of open research and of PLOS. We appreciate that you will have multiple calls on your time, and that at the moment it is hard to predict when these time pressures will occur. We are here to support you, please let us know if you need more time or assistance on any paper you are working on; we will work with you and the authors. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you would like to temporarily pause from receiving new manuscript invitations, please add your unavailable dates in Editorial Manager (how-to video </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cV85pXzLEmA"><span style="font-weight: 400;">here</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">).</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To you all </span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The notes above relate to your activities around working on journals. We appreciate and would like to take this moment to thank all of you – authors, reviewers, and editors –  who are on the front lines of fighting the pandemic, and caring for people affected by it.  </span></li>

Researchers in Singapore have lost a 2011 paper in Gene Therapy after an institutional investigation found that some of their data had been fabricated by a PhD student on the project. Most of the authors were affiliated with the Institute of Bioengineering and Nanotechnology, a unit of the Agency for Science, Technology and Research (A*STAR).  … <a class="more-link" href="https://retractionwatch.com/2020/03/19/researcher-loses-phd-after-investigation-finds-he-faked-data/">Continue reading <span class="screen-reader-text">Researcher loses PhD after investigation finds he faked data</span></a>

                <h4><a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/620039770/0/oupblogpsychology/">How strategists are improving team decision-making processes</a></h4>

<p>How companies and teams make decisions can be very challenging. Poor or ill-structured decision-making processes can make the organization less successful and create destructive conflicts in decision-making teams. But there are a few strategies companies can try that help organizations make big decisions in a better way.</p><p>People operate in complex and dynamic environments, making decisions with limited information under conditions of uncertainty and ambiguity. In contrast to routine decisions, strategic decisions are often made at top-management level and they have an impact on the whole organization in terms of its future direction and the scope of its activities. Such important decisions have a significant impact of the organization’s resource allocation that require trade-offs between alternatives and the setting of organizational priorities. In addition the strategic decision making process  rarely results in one clear best solution to the problem, but an organization makes a  decision it will be difficult to reverse. This is because the implementation of a decision involves a significant resource commitment and change in organizational activities.</p><p>Although we have ways to assess risk through probability theory, dealing with strategic decision problems is much more difficult where the information we gather to support a decision and the actual decision outcomes are uncertain and ambiguous.</p><p><a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://oxfordre.com/psychology/psychology/view/10.1093/acrefore/9780190236557.001.0001/acrefore-9780190236557-e-262">In complex decision situations, groups are better at solving problems than acting alone</a>. This may be because group members bring a variety of information, critical judgment, solution strategies, and a wide range of perspectives to the decision problem. However, groups can be subject to destructive conflict and cognitive biases that may hinder the quality of decision outcomes and group members’ decision acceptance.</p><p>The main group decision-making biases are <em>risky shift</em>, as groups tend to make risker decisions than individuals alone, and <em>groupthink</em>, as group members strive for consensus and harmony in their decision-making. In addition, group conflict may arise when people with competing opinions and solution alternatives clash.  Group decision-making, therefore, presents a managerial conundrum. On the one hand, multiple perspectives of group members can add insight into the problem situation. On the other hand, group diversity can produce fragmentation, conflict, or groupthink.</p><p>Group member interaction in decision-making situations may produce two types of conflict: cognitive and affective conflict. Task-focused<em> cognitive conflict</em> arises when group members focus on a task or an issue and debate to come up with a creative solution.  Cognitive conflict improves decision-making quality as the goal of the decision-makers is to find the best possible solution rather than win the argument. However, there is a danger that this beneficial cognitive conflict spills into a dysfunctional, affective conflict. Instead of working constructively to achieve the best possible solution, the debate becomes personal, adversarial, and a lose-win paradigm where one view prevails while others are discarded.</p><p>Affective conflict tends to be emotional and focuses on personal incompatibilities or disputes. These disputes can result from group members’ personal judgments that they are not fully able to explain to group members. The more these personal judgments influence decisions, the more there is potential for decision-making group members to speculate and find reasons to distrust the motivation and hidden agendas of other group members. Hence, too much affective conflict may hinder overall group performance as the decision will not be accepted by some decision-making group members regardless of the quality of the decision outcome.</p><p>Management consultants have developed several decision-making techniques to encourage critical interaction between decision-making group members. <em>Devil’s advocacy</em> is a decision-making technique where one or more people in the group works to point out all the flaws and risks with an option under consideration. <em>Dialectical inquiry</em> is a decision-making technique where divide into two camps: those advocating for an idea and those advocating against it. Both sides highlight the advantages of their assigned decision and outline the disadvantages of the opposing idea.</p><p>Both dialectical inquiry and devil’s advocacy lead to higher quality assumptions and decision outcomes than a consensus approach in decision-making. However, consensus-seeking groups express more satisfaction and desire to continue to work with their groups and indicate a greater level of decision acceptance than those who were asked to apply dialectical inquiry and devil’s advocacy in their groups’ decision-making process. Hence, management scholars’ attention has turned to developing techniques that maintain moderate levels of cognitive conflict to ensure high quality decision outcomes, but simultaneously preserve group cohesion to prevent emergence of affective conflict.</p><p>Causal mapping is a visual decision-making technique that is designed to help groups improve their strategic decision-making processes and promote cognitive conflict, while at the same time preventing the emergence of affective conflict<strong>. </strong>Visual tools are particularly useful in strategy work as decisions are often made collectively in group working situations.</p><p>In a causal map, ideas are causally linked to one another through the use of arrows and nodes. The arrows indicate how one idea or action leads to another. In effect, the maps are word-and-arrow diagrams where the arrows mean “might cause,” “might lead to,” or “might result in.” Causal mapping facilitates a visual articulation of a large number of ideas, actions, and their consequences.</p><p>An example of a fully developed causal map is depicted in below. The map incorporates the collective understanding of a decision-problem by a decision-making group.</p><div><figure><img height="310" src="https://blog.oup.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/gggggg-180x90.jpg" width="620" />Image Credits: Mikko Arevuo, ‘Epistemic objects in collective decision-making: a practice perspective on the use of causal maps as situated material artifacts’, PhD Thesis, Cranfield School of Management, Cranfield CERES (2015). [accessed 16.07.2019]</figure></div><p>Causal maps that have been created in groups bring together the thinking of many people, including conflicting views, subtly different slants on the same issues, and different perspectives held by individual people. Such causal maps provide simplified representations of the beliefs of the greater group.</p><p>Group causal mapping could be perceived as a form of brainstorming, but there is a distinction between group maps and a free-flowing brainstorming of ideas. Group mapping that is used for decision-making is focused on raising issues and concerns. These are usually activities or events that can either support or challenge the decision-making aspiration of the group. In contrast to eliciting “off-the-wall” ideas in group brainstorming sessions as the means of unleashing creativity, group mapping focuses on bringing together the group members’ current wisdom and experience, as well as issues surrounding the problem. Therefore, group mapping is a process of engaging in a dialogue to uncover the causality between the problem and a number of potential solution outcomes, represented as a visual object. The mapping process provides the means for the decision-making group to structure and merge differing perspectives that should lead eventually into a shared understanding of the issue in a holistic manner.</p><p><a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://www.amazon.co.uk/Visual-Strategy-Mapping-Nonprofit-Organizations-ebook/dp/B00JZUPLPU/ref=sr_1_1?qid=1583250943&amp;refinements=p_27%3AJohn+M.+Bryson&amp;s=digital-text&amp;sr=1-1&amp;text=John+M.+Bryson">There is increasing evidence that</a> the causal mapping process prevents decision-making groups from talking over each other and going around in circles. It helps group members to speak and be heard. The mapping process produces a lot of ideas and can ultimately clarify the most suitable course of action. Furthermore, the shared and collective enactment of a group causal map can increase individual ownership, acceptance, and the feeling of fairness of the decision outcomes. This is because the map shows evidence that people have listened to everyone in the group.</p><p><em>Featured Image Credit: AbsolutVision, ‘Photo of bulb artwork’ via <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://unsplash.com/photos/82TpEld0_e4">Unsplash </a></em></p><p>The post <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://blog.oup.com/2020/03/how-strategists-are-improving-team-decision-making-processes/">How strategists are improving team decision-making processes</a> appeared first on <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://blog.oup.com">OUPblog</a>.</p><img align="left" border="0" height="1" hspace="0" src="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/i/620039770/0/oupblogpsychology" style="border: 0; float: left; margin: 0; padding: 0; width: 1px!important; height: 1px!important;" width="1" /><div style="clear: both; padding-top: 0.2em;"><a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/2/620039770/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/fbshare20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/28/620039770/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/fblike20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/30/620039770/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/googleplus20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/16/620039770/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/linkedin20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/29/620039770/oupblogpsychology,https%3a%2f%2fblog.oup.com%2fwp-content%2fuploads%2f2020%2f03%2fgggggg-180x90.jpg"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/pinterest20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/1/620039770/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/reddit20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/24/620039770/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/twitter20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/19/620039770/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/email20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/20/620039770/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/rss20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a><h3 style="clear: left; padding-top: 10px;">Related Stories</h3><ul><li><a href="https://blog.oup.com/2020/04/re-reading-camuss-the-plague-in-pandemic-times/" rel="nofollow">Re-reading Camus’s The Plague in pandemic times</a></li><li><a href="https://blog.oup.com/2020/04/six-jazz-movies-you-may-not-know/" rel="nofollow">Six jazz movies you may not know</a></li><li><a href="https://blog.oup.com/2020/04/the-perfect-tenses-in-english/" rel="nofollow">The Perfect Tenses in English</a></li></ul> </div>

<img alt="" class="attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image" height="110" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2020/03/adult-aging-alone-american-140x110.jpg" style="display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;" width="140" /><p>Integrated care is characterized by a proactive and person-centered approach to care, which is seamlessly coordinated across multiple professional disciplines and care interfaces. Integrated care aims to improve outcomes such as functioning, quality of life, and quality of care. The organisation of integrated primary and community care is considered an essential step towards supporting older people to age in place.</p>
<h3><strong>Maintaining people’s safety at home</strong></h3>
<p>To support older people living at home, it is essential to maintain their safety. Older people encounter limitations in multiple domains of life, which could pose risks to their ability to live safely and independently at home. Such risks may relate to <a href="https://academic.oup.com/gerontologist/article/47/6/830/626240">different factors</a>, including people’s functioning and behavior, their physical and social environments, and the health and social care they receive. This wide range of risks could lead to a multitude of problems that challenge people’s safety at home, ultimately resulting in emergency department visits, (re)hospitalization, institutionalization and mortality. Given its proactive, interdisciplinary and comprehensive character, integrated care is expected to provide opportunities to address <a href="https://qualitysafety.bmj.com/content/18/6/424.long">the prevention of such risks</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://bmcgeriatr.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12877-020-1482-7?utm_source=bmc_blogs&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=null&amp;utm_campaign=blog_2020_bmcseriesblog">Our recently published scoping review</a> in <a href="https://bmcgeriatr.biomedcentral.com/?utm_source=bmc_blogs&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=null&amp;utm_campaign=blog_2020_bmcseriesblog"><em>BMC Geriatrics</em></a> shows that integrated care programs for older people living at home address a broad range of safety risks. After examining included programs according to the predefined conceptual framework shown in Figure 1, findings show that all programs addressed risks related to people’s functioning and behavior, and several programs addressed risks associated with people’s health and social care management. Fewer programs addressed risks related to people’s social and physical environments. However, as the number of people receiving care and support at home keeps rising, risks related to people’s socio-economic conditions, their home environments, and increasing caregiver responsibilities, for example, are becoming more prominent. Therefore, addressing such risks is important, especially since <a href="https://bmcgeriatr.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12877-017-0521-5">older people themselves also express their concerns</a> regarding these issues.</p>
<figure class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_11783" style="width: 299px;"><img alt="" class="wp-image-11783 size-full" height="289" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2020/03/pic.jpg" width="289" /><div class="attachment-image--caption">Figure 1. Domains of risks that could challenge people’s ability to live safely at home.</div><div class="attachment-image--source"></div></figure>
<p>Timely identification of risks, combined with relevant clinical, behavioral and environmental interventions and support, as well as care coordination or case management, would enhance care providers’ ability to support older people’s safety at home. Prioritizing such a proactive and multidimensional approach requires combining the expertise of professionals from different disciplines of health and social care. However, our scoping review suggests that these linkages between health and social care are not yet common practice in integrated care programs for older people living at home. Investing in <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S016885101930260X">collaborative skills</a> and inter-professional dynamics, as well as addressing financial and organisational incentives for collaboration, are deemed necessary to <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6484371/">strengthen these linkages</a>.</p>
<h3><strong>Balancing safety, autonomy, quality of care and quality of life</strong></h3>
<p>This review showed that integrated care programs can potentially incorporate many ways of addressing and preventing risks. However, it remains challenging to priorities these activities in a way that is meaningful for older people. Adopting a person-centered way of working, in which professional expertise is tailored to people’s individual needs and preferences, is considered one of the core components of integrated care. In this light, it is important to acknowledge that safety is not the only aspect to consider, especially in the care provided in the context of people’s homes. People’s homes are not only care settings, but the setting of their daily lives, and older people may have preferences or make choices that value quality of life over safety. This means that safety risks cannot be addressed independently of older people’s perspectives. Instead, professionals are tasked to consider their professional perceptions in combination with older people’s preferences, and find a balance between aspects such as safety, prevention, autonomy and quality of life.</p>
<blockquote><p>Truly supporting people to age in place requires a societal shift towards a broader paradigm of health and well-being.</p></blockquote>
<p>However, in practice, this raises the question of responsibility and accountability for the safety of older people living at home. Naturally, professionals have no control over how older people live their lives and the choices they make. As such, professionals cannot be held accountable for the adverse consequences of those choices. What then, exactly, is the responsibility of health and social care professionals? And what is the responsibility of older people themselves, their families, or society? How is accountability for adverse events shared across these different stakeholders? These questions necessitate a widespread debate on our perceptions and expectations of quality of care, prevention, and ethics, as well as individual, professional and societal responsibility and accountability.</p>
<h3><strong>Expanding the health care paradigm</strong></h3>
<p>Concluding, integrated care provides both a platform and tools that could be harnessed further to support older people living at home in a manner that balances safety with other values important to older people. However, it is important to note that efforts to integrate health and social care alone are not enough. Truly supporting people to age in place requires a societal shift towards a broader paradigm of health and well-being – a paradigm that recognizes the role that health, social, and environmental factors play in older people’s ability to live safely at home, and in which many different actors in the wider community play their part and perform their responsibilities.</p>

<p><em>By </em><a href="http://emilyoliviareynolds.com/">Emily Reynolds</a></p>
<p>Though some <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2012/01/23/do-smells-really-trigger-particularly-evocative-memories/">research</a> has challenged the common conception that scent is the most evocative of all the senses, it can be undeniably powerful when you catch a whiff of something that jogs a memory. We also <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2018/05/30/people-with-a-keener-sense-of-smell-find-sex-more-pleasant-and-if-they-are-female-have-more-orgasms-during-sex/">know</a> that scent plays a part in sexual attraction: people with a keener sense of smell often find sex more pleasant and may even have more orgasms during sex, and the scent of a partner can <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29293018">reduce stress</a> and increase feelings of safety.</p>
<p>So new research findings from a team at the University of British Columbia may not come as a complete surprise. In a paper <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0956797620905615?rfr_dat=cr_pub%3Dpubmed&amp;url_ver=Z39.88-2003&amp;rfr_id=ori%3Arid%3Acrossref.org&amp;journalCode=pssa">published in </a><em><a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0956797620905615?rfr_dat=cr_pub%3Dpubmed&amp;url_ver=Z39.88-2003&amp;rfr_id=ori%3Arid%3Acrossref.org&amp;journalCode=pssa">Psychological Science</a>, </em>Marlise Hofer and Frances Chen suggest that the scent of your lover may not just be comforting but can also help you drift off to sleep.<span id="more-39349"></span></p>
<p>The team asked 155 heterosexual participants in long-term romantic relationships to sleep with a t-shirt for a pillowcase on two separate nights. One of these shirts had previously been worn for 24 hours by their romantic partner, and the other was a control shirt, which had either not been worn, or worn by a “scent donor” unknown to participants. T-shirt wearers were asked to refrain from using any scented body products and to avoid activities likely to produce odours such as exercise, smoking, sex or eating pungent foods.</p>
<p>Each night, participants’ “sleep efficiency” — i.e. the proportion of time they spent in bed that they were actually asleep — was measured via a smartwatch  Then, in the morning, participants were asked what time they went to bed and got up, how they would rate their sleep quality, how well rested they felt, and whether or not they believed the scent was their partner’s or the control.</p>
<p>As expected, sleep efficiency was higher on nights spent sleeping with a partner’s shirt rather than with a control shirt — and this was still the case when controlling for multiple factors, including participants’ relationship quality and length, attachment style and levels of stress. Efficiency was increased by an average of 2.1% — around the same increase induced by melatonin supplements, often used to improve sleep. And though participants were able to identify their partner’s scent 70% of the time, the results also suggested that sleep efficiency improved whether or not participants were aware that the t-shirt was their partner’s.</p>
<p>When it came to sleep quality, however, participants only reported having higher quality sleep when they <em>believed</em> they were spending the night with their partner’s shirt, whether or not they were actually exposed to their smell.</p>
<p>Individual differences, the team notes, are likely to moderate these effects, something the study did not explore in depth. Women, for example, were more likely to see an increase in sleep efficiency than men, and factors like relationship quality are likely to have a variety of impacts on both quality and efficiency of sleep.</p>
<p>But for anyone who’s ever struggled to drift off when alone, the results are still cheering. Melatonin is all well and good — but a worn t-shirt could be the real secret to getting a good night’s sleep.</p>

<p><i>By</i> <a href="https://emmayoung.net/">Emma Young</a></p>
<p>It might be the best-studied of all our senses, but surprises about the way our vision works just keep on coming. Recent research has startling and also salutary lessons about how we see.<span id="more-39341"></span></p>
<h4><strong>Your brain makes up a lot of what you “see”</strong></h4>
<p>Whether you’re walking around or sitting at a desk, you no doubt feel that you can see pretty clearly all around you. Yes, so you might be looking ahead as you walk through a park, say, but you can see a rich world of grass, trees and people to either side of you. Well, you might be seeing it — but that doesn’t mean it’s all actually there. As <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0956797616672270">research published in <em>Psychological Science</em> in 2016</a> revealed, your brain uses information from the clearly-focused central region of the visual field to fill in detail in the relatively data-poor periphery. In fact, as the lead author, Marte Otten at the University of Amsterdam, commented at the time, “Our findings show that, under the right circumstances, a large part of the periphery may be a visual illusion”. It’s what’s known as a “uniformity illusion”, and you can try it for yourself at <a href="http://www.uniformillusion.com">www.uniformillusion.com</a>.</p>
<p>However, not all peripheral vision is the same… <a href="https://www.pnas.org/content/114/17/E3573">work published the following year</a> suggests that we all have “good” and “bad” regions. Some of the participants in this study, led by John Greenwood at UCL, had sharper left-side than right-side peripheral vision, for example.</p>
<p>And this could have real-world effects, says Greenwood — someone searching a room for missing keys, for example, could fail to spot those keys if they’re on their “bad” side.</p>
<h4><strong>It’s easy to make someone hallucinate (without drugs)</strong></h4>
<p>If you have a willing partner to hand, you can try one hallucination-inducing technique right now. All you have to do, according to research led by Giovanni Caputo and <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2015/08/18/weird-things-start-to-happen-when-you-stare-into-someones-eyes-for-10-minutes/">published in <em>Psychiatry Research</em></a>, is to sit in chairs placed opposite each other, about a metre apart, in a fairly dimly lit room, and look into each other’s eyes. When the 20 young adults in the study tried this for 10 minutes, they reported all kinds of odd experiences. Along with altered perceptions of sounds and time, 90 per cent saw some deformed facial features, while three-quarters said they saw a monster. A state of dissociation might explain these results, the researchers suggest.</p>
<p>Another study, <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2019/04/09/researchers-show-there-is-a-simple-way-to-induce-synesthesia-in-people-with-normal-perception/">published last year by Anupama Nair and David Brang</a>, found that it’s possible to induce synaesthesia-type visual sensations in regular people. For this work, participants sat with their eyes closed in a darkened room for five minutes. Then they were given a simple mental imagery task, designed purely to raise activity levels in the visual cortex. During this task, occasional, unpredictably-timed beeps were played. Overall, nearly 60 per cent reported at least one sound-induced visual perception, such as seeing colourful small circles, flashes or sparkles of light or visual pulses.</p>
<p>It’s known that the <a href="https://www.cell.com/current-biology/fulltext/S0960-9822(14)00458-8?_returnURL=https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0960982214004588?showall=true">visual cortex processes auditory data, too</a>. Short-term visual deprivation can, it seems, make it more likely that sounds will actually trigger visual hallucinations.</p>
<h4><strong>Time stops when you blink</strong></h4>
<p>For about 10% of your waking hours, your eyes are actually shut, because of blinking. Your brain stitches together retinal information from around these gaps, giving you the impression that your vision is uninterrupted. However, these brief but regular dark moments do have an impact: a study led by Ayelet Landau suggests they cause your sense of the passing of time to stop temporarily. This work, published in <em>Psychological Science</em> in 2019 and <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2019/05/14/your-brain-stops-time-when-you-blink/">covered by me on the Research Digest</a>, shows that processing in the visual cortex influences our perceptions of time. It’s possible that when we’re engaged in tasks that stimulate plenty of other senses (when we’re outside, say, rather than sitting at a desk, staring at a screen, reading about psychological research…), this effect could be counteracted.</p>
<h4><strong>You can see infrared and ultraviolet</strong></h4>
<p>A few animals, such as pit vipers and common vampire bats, are infamous for being able to sense the infrared body heat of their prey. This is not a human ability. In fact, we’re not meant to be able to detect infrared at all. However, as an <a href="https://www.pnas.org/content/111/50/E5445">initially serendipitous discovery by researchers at the University of Washington reveals</a>, there are very particular circumstances in which it becomes possible. While working with an infrared laser, which is meant to be invisible to the human eye, researchers at the university reported seeing occasional green flashes. Vladimir Kefalov and colleagues investigated. They found that if two long-wavelength infrared photons of light hit a light-sensitive molecule in a cone cell in the retina in rapid succession, they have the same energy impact as a shorter, visible photon — and this triggers a green perception.</p>
<p>If such infrared vision is very rare, there are <a href="https://www.newscientist.com/lastword/mg24432591-000-super-seers-why-some-people-can-see-ultraviolet-light/">anecdotal reports</a> that seeing very short, ultraviolet wavelengths of light — an ability normally associated with birds and butterflies, for instance — is much more achievable. The cornea and lens absorb this light, so, it’s true, we normally can’t see it. However, people who have had their lenses removed — often because of cataracts — have reported seeing (in blueish-purple) everything from patterns on flowers to ultraviolet light beams from counterfeit banknote detectors.</p>
<h4><strong>Childhood experience can create strange visual categories</strong></h4>
<p>It probably wouldn’t surprise you to learn that you have dedicated circuits of neurons in your visual cortex dedicated to processing particular categories of visual stimulus — such as one for faces, and another for words. But, it seems, these category regions are established through experience in childhood, and as long as your youthful experience with a given type of visual stimulus is intense enough, your visual cortex may well set up a dedicated response unit to handle it on into adulthood. The main recent evidence for this comes from a study by Jesse Gomez and his team, showing that adults who played Pokémon extensively as kids had a <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2019/06/14/adults-who-played-pokemon-extensively-in-childhood-have-a-pokemon-sensitive-region-in-their-visual-cortex/">visual region that was more active when viewing Pokémon characters</a>.</p>
<h4><strong>When you’re afraid, you literally see things differently</strong></h4>
<p>According to a popular model of perception, what you see is generally a function of data coming from the retina to your brain and what your brain expects to see. Depending on the situation, sometimes the retinal data will be given more weight, but other times the brain will rely more on expectation in generating your visual perceptions. We all have a tendency to err on the side of caution — given the potential risk vs benefit, if you’re walking through snake-infested territory, say, it’s safer to see a long shape on the ground as a snake rather than a stick.</p>
<p>But <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/ncomms13854">work published in <em>Nature Communications</em> in 2017</a> provided evidence that when our heart is beating rapidly — when we’re afraid (and perhaps also angry) — we’re especially likely to see threats when there are none.</p>
<p>In this study, racial biases also came into play. The team —Ruben Azevedo, Sarah Garfinkel, Hugo Critchley and Manos Tsakiris — showed images of either black or white individuals holding either a gun or a mobile phone. When the images were presented on the heartbeat, rather than between heartbeats, they were 10% more likely to see the object as a gun when it was held by a black person. The researchers think this effect might explain at least some shootings of black unarmed men by police officers.</p>
<p>Another study, <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2016/01/14/what-does-fear-do-to-our-vision/">published a year earlier by Maria Lojowska’s team</a>, found that when we’re afraid, we perceive some aspects of the world more clearly, but at the cost of ignoring much of the detail.</p>
<h4><strong>How to mess with your colleagues’ minds</strong></h4>
<p>Many optical illusions are presented in 2D, on paper, or on a computer screen. But in 2018, a <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2018/02/14/a-psychologist-noticed-this-cool-chair-illusion-in-his-office/">mind-bending 3D chair illusion</a> showed itself in the office of Nick Scott-Samuel at the University of Bristol. The set of stackable chairs seem to be arranged in an impossible position — a little like an Escher drawing, only stranger. This is because, Scott-Samuel and his colleagues report, the brain gets confused about apparent depth cues when <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/suppl/10.1177/2041669517752372/suppl_file/StackingChairsMovie.mp4">viewing the chairs at an angle</a>. Just four chairs are apparently enough to achieve the effect. So next time you’re early for a meeting, you know what to do…</p>

<p><a href="https://arxiv.org/">arXiv</a>, the world’s leading source of open access scientific research, is pleased to welcome Dr. Eleonora Presani as its first executive director.</p>
<p>Dr. Presani earned her PhD in astroparticle physics at the University of Amsterdam and then completed her postdoc at CERN, where she worked remotely on the International Space Station’s AMS02 instrument. After that, she was publisher at Elsevier for high energy physics journals, and her projects included SCOAP3, SoftwareX, and Physics of the Dark Universe. In the last four years her career shifted to digital product development, working as Product Manager in Scopus.</p>
<p>As executive director, Dr. Presani now leads arXiv’s operations, as well as technical and business planning, governance, and fundraising efforts. Based in New York City, she oversees a growing staff distributed across Cornell University’s Ithaca campus, Cornell Tech in NYC, and other locations. She also coordinates a global network of volunteer advisory board members and moderators.</p>
<p>“I am honored and thrilled to take the helm of arXiv, a groundbreaking service with incredible potential for technological growth and innovative development,” Dr. Presani says. “arXiv was a ‘disrupter’ of traditional academic publishing before the world wide web became popular, and it continues to be a central point of global scientific knowledge sharing. I have been a user of arXiv since my undergraduate study in physics, and it was such an important source of information to me throughout my academic career, as it has been and continues to be for millions of researchers around the world. I look forward to engaging with the scientific and member advisory boards, as well as the larger, global community, to take us to the next level, and make this knowledge more accessible to everyone who wants it.”</p>
<p>Dr. Presani is passionate about bringing the art and complexities of technology to a wider audience, using accessible and creative methods. She also enjoys bridging together systems and people.</p>
<p>“We are very fortunate to have someone of Eleonora’s experience and background joining the arXiv team,” says Carol Hoover, member of arXiv’s Member Advisory Board (MAB) and Digital Information Resources Manager at Los Alamos National Laboratory Research Library. “She is a strong communicator with deep technical capabilities and has a solid understanding of arXiv’s purpose and mission.”</p>
<p>Dr. Licia Verde, chair of arXiv’s Scientific Advisory Board (SAB) and ICREA Professor, says, “We are proud that we can count on Eleonora, her skills, talents and expertise in scientific dissemination and the publishing ecosystem.”</p>
<p>arXiv was founded in 1991 by physicist Paul Ginsparg and is a groundbreaking invention that popularized free, open-access scholarly research. Today, it continues to allow researchers from around the world to share scientific findings quickly, in fields ranging from astrophysics to economics. More than 180 moderators shepherd scholarly articles through the submission process, and more than 230 institutional members contribute financial support, in addition to the Simons Foundation, Cornell University, and other funders. arXiv has grown exponentially in the past decade, with more than 1.6 million submissions and more than a billion downloads in its 29-year history.</p>

In <em>Birth of Intelligence</em>, distinguished neuroscientist Daeyeol Lee tackles pressing issues that will be key to preparing for future society and its technology, including how the use of AI will impact our lives.</li><li><em><a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://global.oup.com/academic/product/how-not-to-train-the-brain-9780198789673">How (not) to train the brain</a></em><em> </em><strong>Amir Raz and Sheida Rabipour <img height="220" src="https://blog.oup.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/ENihhJkDjS0-143x220.jpg" width="143" /></strong><br />Can we improve cognitive performance through deliberate training? The short answer is yes, albeit with some caveats. In this book, the authors review data from hundreds of articles and provide an overarching account of the field, separating scientific evidence from publicity myth and guiding readers through how they should – and should not – train the brain.</li><li><em><a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://global.oup.com/academic/product/the-evolutionary-road-to-human-memory-9780198828051">The Evolutionary Road to Human Memory</a></em> <strong>Elisabeth A. Murray, Steven P. Wise, Mary K. L. Baldwin, and Kim S. Graham </strong><br />This book tells an intriguing story about how evolution shaped human memory. As our ancestors faced the problems and opportunities of their time, their brains developed new forms of memory that helped them gain an advantage in life. Sometime during human evolution, another new kind of memory emerged that ignited the human imagination, and empowered every individual, day upon day, to add new pages to the story of a life.</li><li><em><a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://global.oup.com/academic/product/musical-illusions-and-phantom-words-9780190206833">Musical Illusions and Phantom Words</a></em> <strong>Diana Deutsch <img height="220" src="https://blog.oup.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/EF4XXCFsD6Q-145x220.png" width="145" /> </strong><br />Why is perfect pitch so rare? Why do some people hallucinate music or speech? In this ground-breaking synthesis of art and science, Diana Deutsch, one of the world’s leading experts on the psychology of music, shows how illusions of music and speech—many of which she herself discovered—have fundamentally altered thinking about the brain.</li><li><em><a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://global.oup.com/academic/product/sex-lies-and-brain-scans-9780198752882">Sex, Lies, and Brain Scans</a></em><em> </em><strong>Barbara J. Sahakian and Julia Gottwald </strong><em><br />Sex, Lies, and Brain Scans</em> takes readers beyond the media headlines. The authors consider what the technique of fMRI entails, and important ethical questions these techniques raise. Should individuals applying for jobs be screened for unconscious racial bias? How far will we allow neuroscience to go? It is time to make up our minds.</li><li><em><a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://global.oup.com/academic/product/the-elephant-in-the-brain-9780190495992">The Elephant in the Brain</a></em> <strong>Kevin Simler and Robin Hanson <img height="220" src="https://blog.oup.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/EOGhBuYI0KI-145x220.jpg" width="145" /></strong><br />Our brains are designed not just to hunt and gather, but also to help us get ahead socially, often via deception and self-deception. But while we may be self-interested schemers, we benefit by pretending otherwise. The less we know about our own ugly motives, the better – and thus we don’t like to talk or even think about the extent of our selfishness. This is “the elephant in the brain.”</li><li><em><a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://global.oup.com/academic/product/your-brain-on-food-9780190932794">Your Brain on Food, Third Edition</a></em> <strong>Gary L. Wenk </strong><br />This essential book vividly demonstrates how a little knowledge about the foods and drugs we eat can teach us a lot about how our brain functions. The intersection between brain science, drugs, food and our cultural and religious traditions is plainly illustrated in an entirely new light. Wenk tackles fundamental and fascinating questions, such as: <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://medium.com/@OUPAcademic/feed-an-injured-brain-fad1cb8b729d">Are some foods better to eat after brain injury</a>?</li></ol><p>These books showcase some fascinating areas of brain research. But we’ve still got a long way to go before most of our questions about this intricate organ are answered. A comprehensive understanding of the brain is especially critical to combating public health issues, including rising rates of dementia and psychiatric disorders. As such, the continuing progress of brain research will be beneficial to us all.</p><p><em>Featured Image Credit: Owned by Oxford University Press.</em></p><p>The post <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://blog.oup.com/2020/03/seven-books-on-the-fascinating-human-brain-reading-list/">Seven books on the fascinating human brain [reading list]</a> appeared first on <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://blog.oup.com">OUPblog</a>.</p><img align="left" border="0" height="1" hspace="0" src="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/i/619898700/0/oupblogpsychology" style="border: 0; float: left; margin: 0; padding: 0; width: 1px!important; height: 1px!important;" width="1" /><div style="clear: both; padding-top: 0.2em;"><a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/2/619898700/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/fbshare20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/28/619898700/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/fblike20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/30/619898700/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/googleplus20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/16/619898700/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/linkedin20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/29/619898700/oupblogpsychology,https%3a%2f%2fblog.oup.com%2fwp-content%2fuploads%2f2020%2f03%2fENihhJkDjS0-143x220.jpg"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/pinterest20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/1/619898700/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/reddit20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/24/619898700/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/twitter20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/19/619898700/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/email20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/20/619898700/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/rss20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a><h3 style="clear: left; padding-top: 10px;">Related Stories</h3><ul><li><a href="https://blog.oup.com/2020/03/how-olive-oil-promotes-brain-health/" rel="nofollow">How olive oil promotes brain health</a></li><li><a href="https://blog.oup.com/2020/04/the-surprising-scientific-value-of-national-bias/" rel="nofollow">The surprising scientific value of national bias</a></li><li><a href="https://blog.oup.com/2020/03/how-to-rate-and-rank-potential-doctoral-students/" rel="nofollow">How to rate and rank potential doctoral students</a></li></ul> </div>

                <h4><a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2020/03/16/looking-at-your-phone-at-work-might-make-you-even-more-bored/">Looking At Your Phone At Work Might Make You Even More Bored</a></h4>

<p><em>By </em><a href="http://emilyoliviareynolds.com/">Emily Reynolds</a></p>
<p>There are plenty of things you can do in a five minute break at work — talk to a colleague, make a cup of tea or coffee, or even go outside for some fresh air. But with the advent of digital technology, many of us now spend the short lulls in our day doing something else: looking at our phones.</p>
<p>Previous research has already suggested (fairly unsurprisingly) that smartphone use increases as we get more bored or fatigued. It makes sense: if you’re doing a particularly tedious task at work, you’re much more likely to want to spend a few minutes scrolling on your phone than if you’re doing something deeply engaging.</p>
<p>But does looking at your phone actually <em>relieve</em> boredom? A new study from Jonas Dora and colleagues at Radboud University, available as a <a href="https://psyarxiv.com/uy8rs">preprint at </a><a href="https://psyarxiv.com/uy8rs"><em>PsyArXiv</em></a>, seems to suggest not.</p>
<p><span id="more-39336"></span></p>
<p>It wasn’t immediately clear whether smartphone use would increase or decrease fatigue and boredom. On one hand, previous research suggests that notifications significantly impact people’s ability to concentrate on major tasks; on the other, looking at your phone could provide what the authors refer to as a “microbreak”, allowing a small period in which to recover from the demands (and boredoms) of work.</p>
<p>To explore this relationship further, the team asked 83 participants to rate their level of fatigue and boredom every hour they were at work for three working days. An app had also been installed on their phones, which monitored smartphone use during the twenty minutes before and twenty minutes after these self-reports (times that overlapped with the start of end of work, or with lunch breaks, were omitted from analysis).</p>
<p>Phone breaks were extremely frequent: in the twenty minutes following each questionnaire, participants picked up their phone 52% of the time, spending an average of around ninety seconds on it each time.</p>
<p>As participants’ fatigue and boredom increased, so too did the frequency with which they looked at their phones. For instance,  a ten-point increase in boredom, on a 100-point scale, resulted in a 40% higher likelihood someone would reach for their phone (though there was no evidence that they spent any <em>longer </em>looking at their smartphones).</p>
<p>So did participants feel less bored after picking up their phones? Surprisingly, this wasn’t the case. Researchers looked at fatigue levels twenty minutes before self-reports, finding participants actually reported <em>higher</em> levels of boredom after having used their smartphones (though the effect size was admittedly small — a single digit increase on the 100-point scale).</p>
<p>There are two reasons why this might be the case. Switching between tasks — even between a boring task and an enriching one — can carry a cognitive load of its own, with the reward of a brief glance at a phone not enough to make up the deficit. And rather than being a motivating break, looking at a phone may simply underline the gap between the things you find taxing and the things you find invigorating — thus making you even more fed up and bored when you return to work.</p>
<p>This research had a small sample size, so it’s important not to draw too many definitive conclusions from its findings. But it’s not the only study to find a negative relationship between smartphone use and boredom levels. One <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2016/03/11/put-it-away-spending-work-breaks-on-your-smartphone-is-not-rejuvenating/">2016 paper</a> found that spending work breaks on the phone can lead to decreased levels of motivation: because you’re not allowing your mind to wander when you look at your phone, it suggested, you’re not getting any of the benefits you normally would during a break from work.</p>
<p>So next time you’re bored and feel yourself reaching for your smartphone, it might be an idea to resist it. Leaving your desk or even just looking out of the window for five minutes may be less compelling than what’s on your newsfeed — but you may find yourself less tired, less bored and less demotivated in the end.</p>

                <h4><a href="http://ankursinha.in/2020/03/15/a-vimscript-function-to-select-signatures-in-neomutt.html">A Vim script function to select signatures in Neomutt</a></h4>

<p>I've been using <a class="reference external" href="https://neomutt.org/">Neomutt</a> for a <a class="reference external" href="http://ankursinha.in/2017/12/16/transitioning-to-neomutt-and-friends-for-e-mail.html">while now</a>.
It allows me to stick to the <a class="reference external" href="https://www.byobu.org/">Byobu</a> based terminal workflow that I'm used to.
Most importantly, it lets me use <a class="reference external" href="https://www.vim.org/">Vim</a> to write my e-mails, so I don't need to
really learn another tool now.</p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="https://neomutt.org/">Neomutt</a> can be configured to add a signature at the end of the e-mail, and one
can select a signature depending on various parameters, such as the senders
address using <a class="reference external" href="https://neomutt.org/man/neomuttrc">hooks</a>. However,
sometimes, one does need to select other signatures.</p>
<p>The simple <a class="reference external" href="https://www.vim.org/">Vim</a> way, of course, is to simply delete the last few lines, and
then read in the new signature using <code>:r &lt;filename&gt;</code>. This takes a few
more key strokes than one would like (well, than I like) so I thought I'd
dabble in <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vim_(text_editor)#Vim_script">Vim script</a> a bit and automate it. Here's what I've come up with:</p>
<pre class="code vim literal-block"><span class="c">" A function to load the right signature when I'm using neomutt</span>

    <span class="k">else</span>
        echo <span class="s2">"File "</span> . sigfile . <span class="s2">" not found!"</span>
        echo <span class="s2">"Available signature files:\n"</span> . globpath<span class="p">(</span>sigdir<span class="p">,</span> <span class="s1">'*.sig'</span><span class="p">)</span>
    <span class="k">endif</span>
<span class="k">endfunction</span>
</pre>
<p>So, adding this to <code>~/.vimrc</code> would let one run <code>:call
LoadSignature('signature')</code> in <a class="reference external" href="https://www.vim.org/">Vim</a> to select a signature. Each signature is a
different file with a <code>.sig</code> file extension in the location given by
<code>sigdir</code>, and the name of the file is the argument that needs to be given
to the function. If the signature file cannot be found, it'll list available ones.</p>
<p>It's quite simple really, and I'm sure it can be made better, but it works.</p>

<p>As the global impact of COVID-19 becomes apparent, we write to share updates relevant to the arXiv community.</p>
<p>Currently, arXiv is unaffected by the outbreak and continues to operate as usual. Our intention is to maintain the same speed and service that our community values so deeply. As arXiv’s scientific director Steinn Sigurdsson said, “With quarantines and major conferences being cancelled, arXiv will be as important as ever to sharing research.”</p>
<p>At the same time, we acknowledge that our team is global, and the situation is evolving rapidly. Our highest priority is the health and safety of our community, and we recognize that staff and volunteer moderators may need to take time off to address their personal well-being.</p>
<p>While we plan to keep papers flowing as much as possible, we need to accept that delays might happen. We hope that by keeping open communication among moderators, staff, and users, we can avoid any major disruptions. If your paper is delayed, we graciously ask for your patience.</p>
<p>As a reminder, we’ve added a<a href="https://status.arxiv.org"> status page</a> that will allow anyone to monitor and subscribe to updates around arXiv’s operational status, including planned maintenance, unscheduled outages, and other events that may affect the availability of arXiv services. More information about the status page is available on our recent<a href="https://blogs.cornell.edu/arxiv/2020/03/02/communicating-arxivs-operational-status/"> blog post</a>.</p>

<p><em>By </em><a href="http://emilyoliviareynolds.com/">Emily Reynolds</a></p>
<p>There’s been a lot of back and forth about the psychological effects of taking and sharing selfies. Some <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30149282">research</a> suggests that taking pictures of yourself can dent your self-esteem and increase anxiety, while <a href="https://www.emerald.com/insight/content/doi/10.1108/EJM-07-2015-0512/full/html">other studies</a> have found that selfies can be a source of empowerment; one <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2017/02/23/taking-a-selfie-could-dent-your-self-esteem-unless-you-share-it/">2017 paper</a> even found a combination of the two, suggesting that sharing selfies online can mitigate the damage to self-image often inflicted when a selfie is actually taken.</p>
<p>The hundreds of op-eds, articles and TV features that continue to focus on the issue also suggest that our interest in the phenomenon is unlikely to abate any time soon. And now a <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/17482798.2019.1697319">new study</a> published in the <em>Journal of Children and Media</em> has added to the debate.</p>
<p>It suggests that <em>taking</em> selfies may not be as damaging as other research has claimed. Instead, it’s what you do after you’ve taken the photo that matters: it’s editing images that really hurts our self-esteem.</p>
<p><span id="more-39322"></span>Larissa Terán and colleagues at the University of Arizona first asked 278 teenage girls, aged 14 to 17, about their selfie activities. Participants rated how frequently they share selfies, and were then asked how often they edited their pictures using various different tools (e.g. getting rid of red eye, smoothing skin or making themselves look thinner using editing apps). They were then asked about selfie investment: how much effort and time they spent choosing photos of themselves to post online, as well as how concerned they were about the reception these posts receive.</p>
<p>Next, a questionnaire looked at self-objectification, a phenomenon in which people view themselves as objects rather than human beings. Participants were asked to select how much they identified with statements including “looking attractive to others is more important to me than being happy with who I am” and “I try to imagine what my body looks like to others”.</p>
<p>Participants were then given questions on appearance anxiety, rating how tense they feel when people look at them or when they feel they are being negatively perceived, as well as questions on how ashamed they feel about their appearance and on how they would evaluate their own looks.</p>
<p>As hypothesised, those who spent more time editing, thinking and worrying about selfies were more likely to see themselves as objects than those who did not. This self-objectification, in turn, was linked to greater anxiety and body shame amongst participants, and worse evaluation of their own looks. That is, people who invested more into thinking about or editing selfies tended to have more negative feelings about their own body — and that seemed to be because they were prone to self-objectification.</p>
<p>Interestingly enough — and as the <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2017/02/23/taking-a-selfie-could-dent-your-self-esteem-unless-you-share-it/">2017 paper</a> also suggested — <em>sharing</em> selfies more frequently was not significantly associated with greater self-objectification nor with increased levels of body shame.</p>
<p>The authors have several suggestions as to why simply sharing selfies wasn’t related to negative body image. Pictures may not always be shared with appearance in mind: sometimes teens want to demonstrate who they’re friends with, what they’re interested in or what they’ve been doing. In fact, the team found some evidence that greater selfie sharing was linked to <em>better</em> self-image — meaning posting pictures of oneself might actually <em>decrease</em> shame about looks.</p>
<p>Whether there is actually a causal relationship between these factors, however, is not so clear. It could be that editing selfies contributes to concerns about appearance — that the process of editing, in other words, actively increases body shame. But there is also a distinct possibility that those who <em>already</em> have negative body image are more likely to edit pictures in the first place: their self-esteem is already wavering or low, so they feel the need to edit out hated flaws.</p>
<p>If the results truly are reflective of how teenage girls perceive their selfie taking activities, it may be more accurate to say that the <em>context</em> in which selfies are taken and shared are more important than anything inherent to the act itself. So rather than condemning teenage girls for taking selfies — or banning them from taking them, if you’re a parent — it may be more useful to understand <em>why</em> they’re doing it in the first place.</p>

<p>A <a href="https://bmcnephrol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12882-020-01731-x">systematic review</a> by Neale <em>et al., </em>published today in <em>BMC Nephrology,</em> evaluated the barriers and enablers to the diagnosis and management of CKD in primary care.  Most reviews focus on barriers<em> or</em> enablers but this article was able to address both, which go hand-in-hand in helping PCPs tackle the growing health burden of CKD.  Twenty studies were included in the review. The most common barriers identified were lack of time, fear of delivering the CKD diagnosis, and dissatisfaction with CKD guidelines.  The most common enablers were the presence of supportive technology to identify and manage CKD and collaborative relationships among members of the healthcare team. These and some other identified barriers and enablers from Neale <em>et al. </em>are listed in table 1.</p>

<h3><strong>Strategies to Enhance Early Detection and Management</strong></h3>
<p>Healthcare professionals frequently complain of the inadequate amount of time they can spend with patients. However, PCPs have one of the highest workloads, managing preventative care, acute complaints, multiple co-morbidities, etc.  Developing strategies to streamline the identification and management of CKD through electronic medical records and increasing the use of calculators for estimated GFR and kidney failure risk would benefit PCPs.  In addition, <a href="https://www.bmj.com/content/bmj/350/bmj.h176.full.pdf">adopting policies</a> that enable longer consultations for complex patients will allow protected time to deal with the management of chronic diseases like CKD.</p>
<blockquote><p>Effective co-management of patients with CKD between PCPs and nephrologists is recognized as a key strategy to deliver high-quality CKD care.</p></blockquote>
<p>Improving CKD knowledge and confidence in diagnosis will empower PCPs to provide early diagnosis.  If patients know they have CKD in the primary care setting, they can take steps to increase their own CKD knowledge and self-management of CKD, promoting future favorable outcomes. <a href="https://reader.elsevier.com/reader/sd/pii/S0272638614010610?token=595049B828280D60DE74EE3A6F2A4F0DFFA62F5357753C421BE25E03C6210DA1999D18113CA869B6495D8EF3AB581D07">One study</a> implemented a toolkit to enhance awareness of CKD among PCPs.  This quality improvement activity led to greater identification of CKD, increased referral to nephrology, increased communication among PCPs and nephrologists, and the development of co-management plans. Toolkits like this one should be used more frequently for providing continuing education and resources for our PCPs.</p>
<p>Guidelines rarely deal with comorbidities, but practice guidelines that consider the co-morbid nature of CKD would increase understanding and use among PCPs.  It will help with prioritizing the patient’s problem list and management strategies.  One potential solution is to develop guidelines that consider common clusters of chronic conditions. <a href="http://www.european-renal-best-practice.org/content/erbp-documents-topic">ERBP</a>, <a href="https://kdigo.org/guidelines/">KDIGO</a> and <a href="https://www.kidney.org/professionals/guidelines/guidelines_commentaries">KDOQI</a> have already started to address this by providing guidelines on CKD and co-morbidities such as diabetes mellitus, hepatitis C, and cardiovascular disease.</p>

<p>PCPs and nephrologists working together in a multi-disciplinary team to care of these complex patients can only lead to future healthcare benefits.</p>

<p>This week on Journal Club session Ohki Katakura will talk about the paper "Spatiotemporal network coding of physiological mossy fiber inputs by the cerebellar granular layer".</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>The granular layer, which mainly consists of granule and Golgi cells, is the first stage of the cerebellar cortex and processes spatiotemporal information transmitted by mossy fiber inputs with a wide variety of firing patterns. To study its dynamics at multiple time scales in response to inputs approximating real spatiotemporal patterns, we constructed a large-scale 3D network model of the granular layer. Patterned mossy fiber activity induces rhythmic Golgi cell activity that is synchronized by shared parallel fiber input and by gap junctions. This leads to long distance synchrony of Golgi cells along the transverse axis, powerfully regulating granule cell firing by imposing inhibition during a specific time window. The essential network mechanisms, including tunable Golgi cell oscillations, on-beam inhibition and NMDA receptors causing first winner keeps winning of granule cells, illustrate how fundamental properties of the granule layer operate in tandem to produce (1) well timed and spatially bound output, (2) a wide dynamic range of granule cell firing and (3) transient and coherent gating oscillations. These results substantially enrich our understanding of granule cell layer processing, which seems to promote spatial group selection of granule cell activity as a function of timing of mossy fiber input.</p>

<p><i>By</i> <a href="https://emmayoung.net/">Emma Young</a></p>
<p>Does the language that you speak influence what you think? And do languages that assign a gender to most nouns — such as French and Spanish — lead speakers to feel differently about women versus men, compared with languages that don’t — such as Chinese? Both questions have been hotly debated. But now a major <a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/doiLanding?doi=10.1037/pspa0000188">new study</a>, involving an analysis of millions of pages of text in 45 different languages from all over the world, concludes that gendered languages shape prejudice against women.</p>
<p><span id="more-39315"></span>Gendered languages, such as French and Spanish, Russian and Hindi, dictate that most nouns are male or female. For example, “the ball” is<em> la pelota</em> (female) in Spanish and <em>le ballon</em> (male) in French. In these languages, adjectives and verbs also change slightly depending on the gender of the noun. Then there’s a group of “natural gender” languages, in which nouns aren’t gendered, but pronouns do reflect gender (such as <em>he</em> and <em>she</em> in English, which belongs to this group.) Finally, there are genderless languages, in which a pronoun can refer to either gender, such as Chinese and Finnish.</p>
<p>Earlier research has found that in countries where gendered languages are spoken, women earn lower wages and are less likely to succeed in politics. But researchers have questioned whether the nature of the language itself has anything to do with this. Perhaps, some have suggested, languages simply reflect differences in broader cultural attitudes to men and women.</p>
<p>In the new study, David DeFranza and colleagues at the University of Utah used a technique called Natural Language Processing (NLP) to analyse vast amounts of text taken from Wikipedia and the Common Crawl project, which holds snapshots of text taken from the internet since 2013, comprising more than 630 billion words. Text in 45 different languages, which include the first or second languages of more than half of the world’s population, were included.</p>
<p>The NLP software scanned these texts, looking for close co-occurrences of gender words (such as <em>woman</em>, <em>she</em>, <em>hers</em>, <em>her</em> and <em>man</em>, <em>he</em>, <em>his</em>, <em>him</em> in English) and positive or negative terms. The list of positive terms included <em>love</em>, <em>pleasure</em> and <em>lucky</em>, for example, while the negative terms included <em>abuse</em>, <em>sickness</em> and <em>ugly</em>.</p>
<p>The team found that the gendered languages were much more likely to show skewed associations, with more positive terms being associated with men than with women. For example, in the Commons Crawl component of the study, 19 of the 28 gendered languages used in this analysis — 67% — showed this pattern, whereas none of the 17 genderless languages did.</p>
<p>Various geographic, cultural and demographic factors have been shown to influence gender equality. But the team did control for various of these factors in their analysis (for example, they used data from the Global Gender Gap index developed by the World Economic Forum and the Human Development Index, developed by the UNDP), and the effect still held. “Using languages that span continents and cultures, we find evidence that gender prejudice exists more in gendered languages,” they conclude.</p>
<p>A further analysis used a similar method to explore gender stereotypes within these languages. The team found that in gendered, but not genderless, languages, male words, more than female words, were associated with being “competent”, “skilful” and “confident” (attributes traditionally associated more with men than women) but also “warm” (which traditionally has been associated more with women). In gendered languages, men are seen in a more positive light, overall, it seems.</p>
<p>What might explain this pro-male bias?</p>
<p>The researchers speculate that as gendered languages personify even inanimate objects with a specific gender, the regular use of such terms could frequently, unconsciously reinforce implicit attitudes about men and women. So, if men are traditionally viewed in a more positive light, using masculine nouns could bring to mind the positive associations regarding masculinity and reinforce a pro-male bias. If this is how the effect works, then the broader attitudes of a culture are clearly important, but language type has its own role to play.</p>
<p>There are a few limitations to the study. Most notably, this is an analysis of written text on the internet. Perhaps it doesn’t accurately reflect the attitudes of societies more broadly. However, this text was voluntarily produced by millions of people, and it’s debatable whether studies that involve asking people what they think are better at revealing actual beliefs. Indeed, the researchers argue that their work shows the value of analysing the extraordinary amounts of text held in Wikipedia and Common Crawl for research in social psychology.</p>
<p>Future studies could explore whether other stereotypes, not considered in this study — such as weakness vs power, home vs career, or perceptions of emotional versus rational decision-making — might show different patterns of gender association in gendered vs genderless languages, the team suggests.</p>

<p><strong><em>A case of genetic testing</em></strong></p>
<p>Samila* had been suffering from shortness of breath and exhaustion when, at the age of 19, she was diagnosed with a heart that did not pump properly. Attempting to understand what caused this condition, her cardiologist suggested genetic testing. The test showed no underlying genetic factors for her heart issues and her medication was so effective that Samila thought it all might have been a fluke. However, when she was 26, her cardiologist unexpectedly contacted her with some upsetting information: part of her DNA had been identified as being involved in the development of dilated cardiomyopathy.</p>
<p>*<em>Fictionalized case</em></p>
<p><strong><em>Genetic testing: uncertainty amidst possible expectations of certainty </em></strong></p>
<p>A genetic test inspects parts or even the entirety of the genome, which contains all our hereditary information encoded in the DNA.</p>
<p>The field of human genetics studies the workings of human genomes and how variations within it might play a role in the development of medical conditions. Through these studies, our genes can offer us important insights into why we have developed certain conditions, whether we could develop them in the future, and whether our children are at increased risk of developing them.</p>
<p>We frequently attribute a great deal of certainty to genetic testing and the information it produces in terms of what it can tell us regarding current and future health risks. However, for all our expectations, the connection between our genes and discuss our health is anything but clear-cut. The information provided by genetic testing often contains a multitude of uncertainties.</p>
<p>One such uncertainty is that the meaning of genetic information can change over time. Depending on the moment a genetic test is performed or its data interpreted, patients may receive different results. This can be unsettling for patients and pose a real challenge to genetic professionals.</p>
<p><strong><em>Stable genomes, changing understandings</em></strong></p>
<p>People change, their genomes do not. Our genome is inherited at conception and generally stays constant beyond the day we die. Patients like Samila may, therefore, wonder why they receive new genetic information many years later after their DNA was initially “cleared”. Despite its fixed nature, our understanding and interpretation of the genome is anything but stable.</p>
<p>Genetic testing enables us to inspect an individual genome for variations that differ from a template (i.e. ‘the’ human reference genome). Everyone has millions of variations that differ from this reference, but most are harmless or even beneficial. For patients, then, we need to establish whether these variations can explain or predict conditions or whether they are innocent.</p>
<figure class="wp-caption alignright" id="attachment_11758" style="width: 310px;"><img alt="Suspect gene" class="wp-image-11758 size-medium" height="198" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2020/03/Fig-1-300x198.jpg" width="300" /><div class="attachment-image--caption">Professionals in human genetics might be likened to molecular detectives. <em>Illustration by Julia El Mecky.</em></div><div class="attachment-image--source"></div></figure>
<p>In this sense, geneticists are kind of molecular detectives. They uncover evidence in order to ascertain whether their “suspects” – i.e. variations in an individual’s genome – are guilty or innocent regarding the development of specific conditions.</p>
<p>Complicating the task of reviewing evidence, like in an actual criminal investigation, is that new evidence might unfold as time passes. This new evidence may redefine how genetic variation might be involved in medical conditions.</p>
<p>In Samila’s case, for instance, it was uncertain if some of the initially identified genetic variation was harmless or suspicious. But as time went on, more patients with the same condition appeared to have this genetic variation, which indeed could be associated with cardiomyopathy.</p>
<p><strong><em>New evidence: important implications for patients</em></strong></p>
<figure class="wp-caption alignleft" id="attachment_11759" style="width: 270px;"><img alt="Guilty gene" class="wp-image-11759 size-medium" height="300" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2020/03/Fig-2-260x300.jpg" width="260" /><div class="attachment-image--caption">New evidence can change the “verdict” that is given to genetic variation. <em>Illustration by Julia El Mecky</em>.</div><div class="attachment-image--source"></div></figure>
<p>Evolving genetic evidence can have significant implications for patients and their relatives in terms of treatment decisions, medical protocols, and life decisions.</p>
<p>In Samila’s case, this new interpretation indicated a chronic heart condition that was likely to progress, irrespective of any treatment. Samila was advised to look for a job that was not too stressful. Her children have a 50% chance of having the genetic variation, putting them at higher risk of developing a similar condition.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong><em>Challenges for professionals in genetic healthcare</em></strong></p>
<p>New genetic technologies produce information regarding genetic variation at unprecedented rates, continuously providing new data on the relationship between genetic variation and medical conditions as time moves on.</p>
<p>The changing nature of genetic knowledge raises highly challenging questions for professionals.</p>
<p>For instance, a laboratory geneticist’s role is to interpret the meaning of genetic variation. What are their responsibilities with respect to identifying and providing up-to-date, important health information to individuals who have been tested in the past?</p>
<p>If laboratories would enact a policy of routinely inspecting all new evidence and update the interpretation of genetic data in their registry, patients such as Samila could receive vital medical information at an earlier time. Samila might then have considered measures to prevent her children from inheriting the genetic variation.</p>
<p>However, the workload for professionals to review massive amounts of new evidence is exorbitant and would strain resources, potentially cutting into time spent on other healthcare-related activities. Should the responsibility therefore lie with Samila or her primary care practitioner to regularly request updated interpretations?</p>
<p>It is crucial that these issues are explored through research that includes the perspectives of those involved. Our <a href="https://bmcmedgenomics.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12920-019-0612-6?utm_source=bmc_blogs&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=null&amp;utm_campaign=blog_2020_bmcseriesblog">study </a>looks at these questions in the context of the genetic laboratory. We invite everyone interested to read this paper, which raises important points of consideration for clinical genetics practice.</p>

                <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/~r/plos/Blog/~3/qOI5SF_XHdE/">Your PLOS, New Logo</a></h4>

<img alt="" class="webfeedsFeaturedVisual wp-post-image" height="150" src="https://blogs.plos.org/plos/files/2020/03/19432_text_animation_re-size-150x150.gif" style="display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;" width="150" /><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We’re excited to share a new logo and a new “look” for PLOS! The new visuals you’ll see are a reflection of a broader set of important changes happening here over the past few years. This post gives a little bit of context about the “why” behind this work (and for the design nerds  more keenly interested in the background and some of our process… this is for you!)</span></p>
<p><b>So much has changed… but our “look” hadn’t. </b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Scientific communication has changed since PLOS’ original founding (transforming it has been our </span><a href="https://plos.org/about/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">mission</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> from the very beginning). Open Access is no longer a new idea. And while PLOS remains one of the original pioneers of OA in the global north, Open Access itself is increasingly mainstream. Yet, our look, feel, and color palette has been static for 7+years. And the PLOS “globe” logo had been essentially unchanged since our founding in 2003. (That’s a long time!)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Developing a “look” true to PLOS’ roots, while truly visually new, felt daunting at times. Could we develop a visual brand reflective of the trust our communities place in us that ALSO shows our energy and willingness to break boundaries along the way? Can we capture both our expertise AND daring? And could our “look” channel the passion and excitement we experience daily in our work with researchers all over the world?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We knew we wanted to maintain a connection between the old and new. This work hasn’t been about starting from scratch but about moving forward. Here’s a peek behind the scenes. </span></p>
<p><b>The design process</b><b> </b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We were voracious in seeking out inspiration, resulting in many, many storyboards from our incredibly talented in-house designer (more about her later…). While we’d love to share all her research, here’s a snapshot of some of our favorite themes: </span></p>

</a><b>Use of overlapping shapes: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">We’ve created interesting details by zooming in and out; layering colors and transparencies; and creating new, more complex shapes by overlapping simpler ones. This was inspired by our intersecting communities and the multiple ways we work with them!</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And here’s our logo’s journey, with the final result!</span></p>

<p><b>About PLOS</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">PLOS is a nonprofit, Open Access publisher empowering researchers to accelerate progress in science and medicine by leading a transformation in research communication. We’ve been breaking boundaries since our founding in 2001. PLOS journals propelled the movement for OA alternatives to subscription journals. We established the first multi-disciplinary publication inclusive of all excellent research regardless of novelty or impact, and demonstrated the importance of open data availability. As Open Science advances, we continue to experiment to provide more opportunities, choice, and context for readers and researchers. </span></p>

<img alt="" class="attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image" height="110" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2020/03/placenta-2433431_640-140x110.jpg" style="display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;" width="140" /><p>Almost every animal on the planet which produces a placenta eats it after birth. There are only a few exceptions to this rule – aquatic animals, camels, and humans.</p>
<p>In fact, humans are so averse to eating our own placentas after birth that it has not been recorded by any culture anywhere in the world in all of human history. We have buried them, burned them and occasionally sold them as medicine to other people, but <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/03670244.2010.524106?casa_token=FRqe63-3CvwAAAAA%3A8UeE7jzb_OoZFMOjR5MnZKqzSlvG2YrCDtoXn8r1cyYnXK-eA_RMtkOrxHGsOQXvEJa_c2T33oPU">as far as we know</a>, we have never routinely eaten our own. That is, <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/03670244.2012.719356?journalCode=gefn20">until the 1970s</a>, when the practice started spreading.</p>
<p>“Post-partum human maternal placentophagy” is the term for the phenomena of the birthing parent eating their own placenta after they have given birth. It is something which existing research indicates is <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/03670244.2012.719356?journalCode=gefn20&amp;">done almost exclusively by married, heterosexual, middle- or upper-class white women in the Global North</a>.</p>
<h3><strong>But why?</strong></h3>
<p>In order to answer that question, we can look in the place where people are already talking about it: the internet. More specifically, <a href="https://bmcpregnancychildbirth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12884-020-2824-3?utm_source=bmc_blogs&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=null&amp;utm_campaign=blog_2020_bmcseriesblog">our research</a>, published in <a href="https://bmcpregnancychildbirth.biomedcentral.com/?utm_source=bmc_blogs&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=null&amp;utm_campaign=blog_2020_bmcseriesblog"><em>BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth</em></a>, looked at threads posted on the UK parenting forums Mumsnet and Netmums and analysed them to see if common themes could be established.</p>
<blockquote><p>Parenting forums can be important spaces for women to seek advice, including about placentophagy.</p></blockquote>
<p>What we found was that people usually decide to eat their placentas because they either previously had, or felt they were at risk of, a negative experience during birth and the post-partum period. Most commonly, these were women who had existing mental health problems or had previously experienced post-natal depression (PND) and were worried about a recurrence. PND can be an awful, isolating and stigmatized condition and people were willing to seek a broad range of possible preventative measures – including eating their placenta.</p>
<p>The rationale for this is that in the immediate postpartum period, the birthing parent experiences a large and sudden drop in pregnancy-related hormones that can result in low mood and energy. The placenta produces a lot of those hormones and so re-ingesting it could replace some of them. The theory is that taking placenta in the form of an encapsulated pill once or twice a day over a period of time can mitigate some of that loss and therefore reduce or treat depression, induce lactation, boost mood, reduce cramps, improve energy and so on. According to existing research, there is no evidence that this is true (and <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1871519217302081?via%3Dihub">fairly good evidence</a> that it has no impact on these things), but that does not stop the popularity of the practice.</p>
<h3><strong>Popularity of placentophagy</strong></h3>
<p>There are a few potential factors increasing this popularity. Nobody finds the idea of eating a placenta particularly appetizing. The practice of encapsulation (steaming and/or dehydrating, grinding up and placing the placenta into capsules) helps alleviate the potential unpleasantness, making the practice palatable to more people. This process costs somewhere between £100-400 to pay someone else to do. For those who are handy, there are DIY guides and kits that can be purchased online. Some may instead choose to mix the placenta with fruit in a smoothie, or consume it some other way, but encapsulation is by far the most popular method. The media attention on the topic has also helped push it into the public view and the internet is being used as a tool for sharing logistical information and overcoming potential barriers to practice.</p>
<blockquote><p>Placentophagy can be understood as a way of exerting control and managing fears around birth.</p></blockquote>
<p>The data we looked at also demonstrated that parenting forums can be important spaces for women to establish normative parenting values and seek advice, including about placentophagy. Whilst there were the expected jokes about it, there was also an emphasis on personal choice, bodily autonomy and the value of each other’s experiences to support those who had done or were considering the practice.</p>
<h3><strong>Motivations and concerns</strong></h3>
<p>We conclude that placentophagy can be understood as being practiced as a way of exerting control and managing fears around birth and the birthing experience. It is medically legitimized through its similarity to medication and the sterile procedures used to create the “pills,” yet there is also an element of eschewing medical or scientific advice and seeking knowledge from people who have been in the same situation.</p>
<p>There are some understandable concerns about the practice. Seeking to address the issue oneself may cause a delay in seeking treatment for PND or other post-natal problems and there is a small concern about potential infection risk if the process is not sterile. A <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/birt.12354">large medical records study in the USA</a> found no evidence of adverse outcomes associated with the practice, which is reassuring, but may not be applicable to other countries where methods may vary subtly or significantly. When it is brought up in clinical practice, healthcare professionals should be able to non-judgmentally and openly discuss with pregnant people the available medical evidence, or lack thereof, for placentophagy. They should also explore the reasons why someone might be considering it and if there is any additional support they want or need.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://xcorr.net/2020/03/04/rewriting-matlab-code-in-python/">Rewriting Matlab code in Python</a></h4>

<div class="wp-block-group"><div class="wp-block-group__inner-container">
<div class="wp-block-jetpack-markdown"><p>So you’re beginning to use Python daily. Great! You might still have a critical set of Matlab scripts from back in the day that doesn’t have a neat equivalent in Python. How do you rewrite this code in Python without introducing many headaches? I’ve had to do this a handful of times and have developed a method based on test-driven development that avoids the biggest issues in code translation:</p>
<ol>
<li>Define what you want to translate</li>
<li>Create a test plan based on existing code</li>
<li>Write tests in Python</li>
<li>Write the code in Python</li>
<li>Iterate until tests pass</li>
</ol>
<p>To test the method, I’ve migrated a script that I found in <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19709635">Susillo and Abbott (2009)</a>. It simulates a chaotic neural network and trains it with recursive least-squares. I wanted to make sure I would run into issues (gotchas!) when I translated the code to exercise the method – and I did run into issues! The method I’m outlining highlighted the translation bugs early and helped squash them.</p>
<blockquote><p>This is part 3 of my guide on transitioning from Matlab to Python. Read <a href="https://xcorr.net/2020/02/21/transitioning-away-from-matlab/">part 1: a curriculum to learn Python</a> and <a href="https://xcorr.net/2020/02/29/orienting-yourself-through-python/">part 2: choosing environments, IDEs and packages</a>.</p></blockquote>
<h3>Pick your battles</h3>
<p>Algorithmic code that does matrix manipulation is typically a good candidate for translation into Python. Importantly, the code you will translate needs to currently run in Matlab, since we’re going to have to run the code and capture its current behaviour. <a href="https://realpython.com/build-python-c-extension-module/">Mex code can be repurposed pretty straightforwardly into a Python extension</a>, keeping the core C numerics intact.</p>
<p>Try to avoid direct translation of code with dependencies on Simulink, GUIDE, or esoteric toolboxes. For GUIDE in particular, I’ve found that the limitations of GUIDE enforce a certain style of coding – lots of globals and convoluted logic. You’re probably better off rewriting the GUI code from scratch than attempting direct translation.</p>
<p>Not every piece of Matlab code needs to be translated to Python. If your goal is to archive an existing pipeline so it continues to run despite deprecation, <a href="https://github.com/mathworks-ref-arch/matlab-dockerfile">containerizing Matlab with Docker</a> is a good route. You can also call legacy Matlab code from Python directly using the official Matlab engine for Python from Mathworks or using shell calls. However, some situations will <em>require</em> translating Matlab code, for instance, if you want to run your code in the cloud.</p>
<p>Finally, consider doing the process for a smaller project first. It’s not that easy! You will learn a lot from doing this once on a smaller scale. I recommend that you <a href="https://swcarpentry.github.io/git-novice/">create a git repo for your project and commit regularly</a>, because you might be doing a lot of iterations to get everything to run correctly.</p>
<h3>Creating a test-based strategy for rewriting the code</h3>
<p>We’ve identified a good script or function to rewrite. Should we start writing Python? No! It is very easy to rewrite code in another language that <em>seems</em> to work, but has subtle bugs. You can spend days or weeks chasing down these bugs, and it will drive you crazy! For this reason, we will use a test-based strategy:</p>
<ol>
<li>Capture what the behaviour of the code is <em>right now</em> for a variety of inputs.</li>
<li>Rewrite the code in Python and make sure it does exactly the thing that we want it to do. That is, for the same inputs, it gives us the same outputs.</li>
</ol>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unit_testing">We will create unit tests to verify the behaviour of our code is correct</a>, meaning that it matches the old code exactly. At this point, you may say – <em>hold on, I don’t just want to transfer the code over, I want to improve it</em>! Our goal is to capture the logic part of the code – the number-crunching. This does not stop us from improving the reference code in a number of ways, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Making constants changeable</li>
<li>Making the code more modular</li>
<li>Using Pythonic data structures, for example using <code>pandas</code> to store time series.</li>
</ul>
<p>In any case, we have to build on a solid foundation – a reference. Once we replicate the original behaviour and commit it to a repo, we can improve it later in a new commit.</p>
<h3>Identify inputs and outputs</h3>
<p>We need to identify the inputs and outputs of the script or function we want to rewrite. One very nice thing about Matlab is that functions tend to be stateless and do not modify their arguments (unless an input is a reference object type, which is pretty rare). Thus, we can reason pretty easily about the inputs and the outputs to a function:</p>
<ul>
<li>The inputs are the arguments.</li>
<li>The outputs are the return variables.</li>
</ul>
<p>Functions may have side-effects, such as creating a plot or saving a file. A side-effect to a function is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Side_effect_(computer_science)">an observable effect besides returning a value (the main effect) to the invoker of the operation</a>. If the code you’re translating has side-effects, you should aim to remove them.</p>
<p>For example, consider a function takes in data and returns nothing, saving the results to disk, like so:</p>
<pre><code class="language-matlab">function [] = mycomplexop(outfile)
    data = zeros(100, 100);
    % Complex things happen in the middle...
    save(outfile, 'data');
end
</code></pre>
<p>You can transform this into a side-effect-free function by returning the results instead of saving them:</p>
<pre><code class="language-matlab">function [data] = mycomplexop()
    data = zeros(100, 100);
    % Complex things happen in the middle...
    return
end
</code></pre>
<p>I prefer to comment out plotting code rather than trying to replicate it exactly. Again, we want to focus on the number crunching.</p>
<h3>Identify test cases</h3>
<p>Many Matlab scripts are written in a style where the inputs to a function are set up, a function or set of functions are called, and then the output is plotted. We need to capture the inputs to this set of functions as well as the inputs. An easy way to do this is using <code>save</code>:</p>
<pre><code class="language-matlab">% Set up the inputs.
t = 0:1000;
dt = .1;
g = 10;

save inputs.mat -hdf5

% Call the function
complexoutput = mycomplexfun(t, dt, g);

save outputs.mat -hdf5

% Plotting the output
plot(t, complexoutput);
</code></pre>
<p>I used Octave here – but you can use <code>-v7.3</code> rather than <code>-hdfd5</code> to save if you’re using Matlab. <code>mat</code> files saved in these formats are actually hdf5 files that Python can read.</p>
<p>Pay special attention to randomization. It will be hard to replicate Matlab’s random number generation exactly in Python. Ideally, functions should be independent of randomizations, because functions with random outputs are very hard to test for correctness. If a function requires random variables to implement an algorithm, we can circumvent this issue by giving the function the random data it needs. For example, let’s say we have a function that computes the distribution of the range of a random normal variable:</p>
<pre><code class="language-matlab">function [dist] = rangedist()
    A = randn(100, 1000);
    dist = max(A, 1) - min(A, 1);
end
</code></pre>
<p>We can rewrite this function so that its source of randomness comes from outside the function:</p>
<pre><code class="language-matlab">function [dist] = rangedist(A)
    dist = max(A, 1) - min(A, 1);
end
</code></pre>
<p>Then we can generate the <code>A</code> variable in a script, and save that particular random draw.</p>
<p>Make sure to pick test cases that won’t take more than a few seconds to run. You will be running your tests many times, and these seconds will add up! Toy data is fine. It’s also good practice to test our code on simple inputs where the correct output is clear, for example, all zeros, all ones, etc. Save as many input-output pairs as is necessary to capture the range of behaviours of functions you want to capture.</p>
<p>In addition to testing our script end-to-end, we may choose to test intermediate computations involved in the script. Testing more fine-grained computations will help you debug your code. If your function is already written as a function, it may call private functions – which can make things a bit tricky. You may need to refactor a bit of the Matlab code to make private functions public so that you can capture both their inputs and outputs.</p>
<h3>Writing a test scaffold</h3>
<p>Unit testing checks whether the results of a function are as expected given a set of inputs. Testing in Python can range from using simple inline <code>assert</code> statements to sophisticated automated solutions that check that tests pass every time you push code into your repo. In our case, we will use a lightweight manual testing method: hiding test cases behind <code>__name__ == '__main__'</code>.</p>
<p>We will create a python module that is meant to be imported, for example, via <code>import mymodule</code>. When we run the file on the command line, however, via <code>python module.py</code>, the code hidden behind this <code>if</code> statement will be run:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">import numpy as np

def my_complex_fun(A):
    # Complicated things occur.
    return A * 2

def _run_tests():
    # Load inputs.
    with h5py.File('inputs.mat', 'r') as f:
        A = np.array(f['A/value'])

    with h5py.File('outputs.mat', 'r') as f:
        B_ref = np.array(f['B/value'])

    # Call the function.
    B = my_complex_fun(A)

    # Check shapes are good.
    assert A.shape == B.shape

    # Check values are similar.
    np.testing.assert_all_close(B, B_ref)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    # Run the tests.
    _run_tests()
</code></pre>
<p>The tests are inside the <code>_run_tests()</code> function. This way, the module namespace will not be polluted with variables that could have the same name as other variables inside of a function.</p>
<p>When the code is run, the tests should raise errors if the output is not as expected, which will stop execution. You will see a big old error on the command line, and then you know that you must correct the code. You can raise an error by:</p>
<ul>
<li>Using the <code>assert</code> statement. It raises an error whenever the statement is False.</li>
<li>Using the methods in <a href="https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/reference/routines.testing.html"><code>np.testing</code></a>. These methods can check whether, for example, the elements of numpy array are all close to a reference (within numeric error).</li>
<li>Using the <code>raise</code> statement to manually raise an error.</li>
</ul>
<p>That’s really all you need to test code. <a href="https://realpython.com/python-testing/">Numerous unit-testing libraries in Python exist</a>, but at their core is the same idea: create code that raises an error when the output not what is expected.</p>
<h3>Picking organization</h3>
<p>Main effects are much easier to test than side effects in the unit-testing framework. You’ll often find yourself writing side-effect-free, modular and functional code for this reason. That’s great! You’ll tend to create smaller functions so that you can test each individual component. Your code will be easier to reason about.</p>
<p>The Python code you write may be objected-oriented. Although Matlab now has excellent support for classes, much Matlab code, especially older code, eschews the use of classes. If you don’t feel comfortable writing object-oriented code, don’t sweat it – Python code doesn’t have to use classes to be Pythonic. Classes make sense when something needs to remember and manage its own state. <a href="https://realpython.com/python3-object-oriented-programming/">Here’s a tutorial on Python classes if it’s something that intrigues you</a>.</p>
<h3>Writing the code – common gotchas</h3>
<p>Now that we’ve picked our tests, and picked how we’ll organize our code, we can start coding. Matlab’s matrix operations naturally translate to Numpy. Be careful with these common gotchas:</p>
<ul>
<li>Reshape operations will cause you headaches. Matlab uses Fortran order, Python uses C by default. This means in Matlab:</li>
</ul>
<pre><code class="language-matlab">A = [1, 2, 3; 4, 5, 6]
A(:)

ans = 
    [1, 4, 2, 5, 3, 6]
</code></pre>
<p>Whereas in Python:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">&gt;&gt;&gt; A = np.array([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]])
&gt;&gt;&gt; print(A.ravel())
[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
</code></pre>
<ul>
<li>Saving to hdf5 in Matlab and loading in Python will invert axes because of the distinction between C and Fortran order. You will have to swap axes front to back, for example. For example, if you save a three-dimensional tensor in Matlab <code>A</code> and then load it back in Python via hdf5, you will need to call <code>A.swapaxes((2, 1, 0))</code> to get back the original tensor.</li>
<li>Be careful with dimension-one vectors! If you have a one-dimension vector <code>a</code> of shape <code>(N, )</code>, then <code>a.dot(a.T)</code> gives you a vector of the shape <code>(N, )</code>. It will not be a scalar, nor a matrix. If you wanted to computed the outer product of <code>a</code> with itself, use <code>a.reshape((-1, 1)).dot(a.reshape((1, -1)))</code> or better yet <code>np.outer(a, a)</code>.</li>
<li>Hidden dot products can cause problems! The <code>*</code> operator applies to scalars and to vectors in Matlab, and the semantics are different depending on the dimension of the operands. <code>A.dot(B)</code> replace Matlab’s <code>A * B</code>. <a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0465/">You may also see <code>A @ B</code> being used but it’s still rather esoteric</a>. * Objects in Python have pass-by-reference semantics. Several methods in numpy modify data in place. Be careful! Sometimes, you will explicitly need to <code>copy()</code> your data.</li>
<li>Python uses 0-based indices and Matlab 1-based indices. Watch out!</li>
<li>Look at your data! Don’t fly blind!</li>
</ul>
<p>If you write a piece of code that you suspect may cause a bug, you can use inline <code>assert</code> statements to make sure it works. I like to use this to check the dimensions of intermediate arrays, for example.</p>
<p>Some of the problems of direct index manipulation can go away by using <code>pandas</code> dataframes where appropriate. <a href="http://xarray.pydata.org/en/stable/"><code>xarray</code></a> uses named dimensions for tensors, which can help avoid many mistakes caused by the need for swapping axes and reshaping. <a href="https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/reference/generated/numpy.einsum.html"><code>np.einsum</code></a> can express complicated sums and products of tensors in an easy-to-read, less error-prone manner.</p>
<p>You might want to consider translating parts of your numerics to <a href="https://pytorch.org/">PyTorch</a> or <a href="https://www.tensorflow.org/">Tensorflow</a> directly, especially if you want to take advantage of automatic differentiation. Performance-sensitive code can be JIT’ed using <a href="https://github.com/google/jax">jax</a> or <a href="https://numba.pydata.org/">numba</a>, or rewritten in <a href="https://cython.org/">Cython</a>. Start small and optimize as necessary.</p>
<h3>Using the method on a real script</h3>
<p><a href="https://github.com/patrickmineault/test-driven-migration/blob/master/original_force_external_feedback_loop.m">The example script I rewrote is about 165 lines of code</a>. It’s written in a pedagogic style and intersperses explanations, logic and plotting. In that sense, it’s similar to a jupyter notebook. I focused on transferring the logic of the main loop, which does a forward simulation of the network and trains it with the FORCE algorithm.</p>
<p>I had to change a handful of things related to plotting to get it to run in Octave, but I was able to get it to run within about 10 minutes. Not bad for 10-year code! The code is organized in this way:</p>
<ul>
<li>sets up variables.</li>
<li>runs the body of the computation (a big <code>for</code> loop). This body has side effects (plotting).</li>
<li>finishes in an end state that contains the results of the computation.</li>
</ul>
<p>Although the code is not set up as a function, it was fairly easy to isolate the inputs are – they’re what the <code>for</code> loop needs to get started:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>x0</code>, <code>z0</code>, <code>wf</code>, <code>dt</code>, <code>M</code>, <code>N</code>, <code>ft</code></li>
</ul>
<p>And the outputs are the variables computed in the main for loop, namely:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>zt</code> and <code>w0_len</code></li>
</ul>
<p>I captured these inputs and outputs as a test case for my script. I commented out the forward simulation of the trained network that comes after the main for loop since it’s another logically separate component of the code that I could attack later.</p>
<p>In addition to the end-to-end result of the script, I captured the result of the first iteration of forwarding the network state, to create a more granular test. I also checked array dimensions.</p>
<p>I decided to write the code as a class, with methods <code>train</code> and <code>simulate</code>. <a href="https://github.com/patrickmineault/test-driven-migration/blob/master/chaotic_rnn.py">The resulting code doesn’t look like Matlab code</a>. Yet, because I’d set up a test scaffold, I could be assured that it works the same as the old Matlab code.</p>
<p>Translation was hard! I ran into multiple very subtle issues translating the rather short code I was working (maybe 20 lines of real logic). The issues were subtle – incorrect manipulation of dimension-1 vectors, off-by-1 errors in a loop. Having reference code and functional tests allowed me to isolate these issues, fix them, and replicate the original functionality exactly. It took about 3 hours, which is a lot! I was very careful to set up a well-defined goalpost when I translated the code, so I knew when I would be done, which kept me going.</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/patrickmineault/test-driven-migration/blob/master/chaotic_rnn.py">The translated code is available here</a>. <a href="https://github.com/patrickmineault/test-driven-migration/blob/master/Use%20chaotic%20RNN.ipynb">I imported the code into a notebook and generated some figures from it</a> – it runs!</p>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>Using test-driven development, it’s possible to systematically, incrementally transfer legacy Matlab code to the Python environment. You can be assured that the code will <em>work</em> in the end because you will have defined what <em>working</em> means. You will have created a test suite for your code with good coverage for your new Python code. You might even have spotted subtle bugs in the original Matlab code along the way! Future you will thank you for your attention to detail.</p>

<img alt="" class="attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image" height="110" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2020/02/19954646-140x110.jpg" style="display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;" width="140" /><p>As people grow older, they may experience changes in their memory, like forgetting an appointment or someone’s name, leading to concerns about their memory functioning. And older adults sometimes report having memory problems despite performing normally on memory tests, such as those conducted by their doctor. Even if cognitive testing is normal, <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24363073">subjective memory complaints</a> are important to consider as they might be an early indicator of more serious problems with memory and <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17623488">cognition</a> or psychological stress such as depression or anxiety. Older adults can have <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23215819">memory complaints</a> as well as <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26880907">typical symptoms of depression</a>, making it difficult for healthcare providers to determine how these symptoms are related. It is unclear from the current research whether, in older adults with both depressive symptoms and memory complaints, depressive symptoms lead to problems with memory or whether the perception of memory problems contributes to the development of depressive symptoms.</p>
<p>To better understand the order in which memory complaints and depressive symptoms occur, we need to see how these two symptoms develop within an individual over time. In <a href="https://bmcgeriatr.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12877-020-1451-1?utm_source=bmc_blogs&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=null&amp;utm_campaign=blog_2020_bmcseriesblog">our new study</a>, published in <a href="https://bmcgeriatr.biomedcentral.com/?utm_source=bmc_blogs&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=null&amp;utm_campaign=blog_2020_bmcseriesblog"><em>BMC Geriatrics</em></a>, we examine the development of depressive symptoms and memory complaints in two large groups of older adults across periods of 6-18 years.</p>
<h3><strong>What we did</strong></h3>
<blockquote><p>Perceiving that their memory is getting worse may lead an older adult to experience symptoms of depression.</p></blockquote>
<p>We used two large, publicly available datasets that together represented over 10,000 older adults from across the United States. These longitudinal datasets included measures of memory complaints and depressive symptoms, collected via interviews conducted every year or every other year for up to 18 years. Any older adult experiencing clinically significant changes in their cognition was removed from our study. This is important because individuals with cognitive impairment may not report memory complaints due to a lack of awareness of their memory problems.</p>
<p>Older adults reported their perceptions of their memory in two questions, one for current memory rating and one for memory decline over the past year or two years. The first question asked for a rating of their memory at the present time. A second question then asked whether they perceived their memory to be better, worse, or the same as it was the last time they were interviewed. For depressive symptoms, older adults indicated whether they had recently experienced a range of symptoms e.g., felt down, depressed or hopeless. We controlled for other personal characteristics that might influence depressive symptoms and/or memory complaints such as sex, education level, age, race/ethnicity, income, and marital status.</p>
<h3><strong>What we found</strong></h3>
<p>We first examined whether memory complaints co-occurred with depressive symptoms. That is, at times when a person reported a memory complaint, did they report more depressive symptoms? In one of the two datasets, we found that at times when an older adult provided lower current memory ratings, they also reported more depressive symptoms. Importantly, we also found that at times when an older adult reported a decline in memory, they also reported more depressive symptoms at that same interview across both datasets.</p>
<p>We then examined whether memory complaints predicted future depressive symptoms. We found that older adults’ rating of their current memory at one interview was not related to their depressive symptoms at the next interview. However, when an older adult reported a decline in memory at one interview, they reported more symptoms of depression at the next interview across both datasets. Interestingly, this was not true in the other direction: current symptoms of depression did not predict future memory complaints.</p>
<h3><strong>What it means</strong></h3>
<blockquote><p>Helping older adults understand normal changes in memory could prevent increases in depressive symptoms.</p></blockquote>
<p>Memory complaints are often seen as a symptom of depression in older adults; however, our work suggests that this is not the case for all types of memory complaints. Older adults’ low rating of their memory performance can be related to depressive symptoms, but is not always. In contrast, older adults’ feeling of their memory getting worse over longer periods of time (e.g., a year or two) is consistently related to their current feelings of sadness and hopelessness as well as to increases in future depressive symptoms. Therefore, perceiving that their memory is getting worse may lead an older adult to experience symptoms of depression. This may be because when an older adult feels like their memory is getting worse, they start to experience sadness or hopelessness about their memory, and what it means to grow older in general. Alternatively, for some older adults, perceiving that their memory is getting worse could also trigger fears about dementia or other aging-related disorders. It likely depends on the individual and their different experiences with aging and memory.</p>
<h3><strong>Clinical implications</strong></h3>
<p>Health care professionals working with older adults should consider asking them about how their memory is changing over time. These types of questions are necessary to understand how an older adult is currently feeling, but are also important for how they may be feeling at future appointments. This suggests that helping older adults understand normal changes in memory could prevent increases in depressive symptoms and promote better psychological health and well-being.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://xcorr.net/2020/02/29/orienting-yourself-through-python/">Orienting yourself through Python</a></h4>

<p>I was surprised by the amount of positive response to my <a href="https://xcorr.net/2020/02/21/transitioning-away-from-matlab/">last article on transitioning away from Matlab</a>. Many people are ready to switch – but they’re facing some significant challenges. One of the biggest things I’ve heard beginners say is that they are overwhelmed with the number of choices they have to make with Python. Python is open-source, has a decentralized contribution model, and has been around for more than 25 years. For everything that you can do one way in Matlab, there are at least 10 different ways of doing it in Python. Picking the best one is stressful!</p>

<div class="wp-block-jetpack-markdown"><p>This is my rough guide to orienting yourself with Python. Don’t read it all in one go, it will make your head spin! The goal is not to overwhelm you with information, but to have this information as a reference when you’re ready to use it. The recommendations are based on my personal opinions and experiences. They’re written with the intent of minimizing the amount of research and pain you’ll have to go through as a beginner. Don’t agree? Post in the comments! Feedback is a gift.</p>

<h4>Which distribution should I choose?</h4>
<p>The Python distribution on the python.org website <em>does not</em> include a lot of core packages needed for data science. It also does not include a package manager. A package manager allows you to automatically download and install a set of scripts and modules of a specific version – a package. People recommend using <a href="https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/">the Anaconda distribution</a>, which is more fully-featured. It includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Python.</li>
<li><code>ipython</code>, the interactive python console.</li>
<li>The <code>conda</code> package manager. Note that conda and the Anaconda distribution are two different (though similarly named) things.</li>
<li>Many of the core packages needed for data science.</li>
<li>An installer that sets your path correctly, which is especially important on Windows.</li>
</ul>
<p>You should pick the <a href="https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/">latest stable version of Python 3 that conda comes in, in its 64-bit incarnation</a>. Python 2 has been deprecated for several years, and you should not be using it.</p>
<h4>Which package manager should I use?</h4>
<p>When you try to install packages like <code>tensorflow</code> and <code>pytorch</code>, you’ll quickly find that there are often two ways to install the same thing:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>pip</code>: the lightweight package manager. Originally pip could only install Python packages, but these days it can install non-Python system-wide dependencies to Python packages.</li>
<li><code>conda</code>: the heavy-duty package manager. It’s not just for Python, it’s for everything! This includes Python packages with weird dependencies, R and Julia packages, text editors, etc.</li>
</ul>
<p>Generally, packages will tell you how you should install them. Just follow the instructions. In either program manager, the process is similar: open the command line, type in a command, for example:</p>
<pre><code>pip install pytorch
</code></pre>
<p>or:</p>
<p><code>conda install pytorch</code></p>
<p>Then confirm, and wait for the install to finish. No need to set the path or anything. Generally, I find that conda is slower but it can install a wider range of things.</p>
<h4>Where should I install my packages?</h4>
<p>When you install a package in Python, you can either install it in the base (or root) environment or in a custom environment.</p>
<p>&gt; A virtual environment is a named, isolated, working copy of Python that that maintains its own files, directories, and paths so that you can work with specific versions of libraries or Python itself without affecting other Python projects.</p>
<p>If you’re coming from the Matlab world, you know all the annoyances that come with managing the path. Imagine removing the path and replacing it wholesale when you switch projects. That’s sort of what environments do in Python. Another metaphor you might like is a virtual machine or a container. It’s a little sandbox in which you can put packages. If you bonk your environment, you delete it and create a new one. No need to reinstall your computer!</p>
<p>There are a few different environment managers, but since you installed Anaconda (above) and you have <code>conda</code> installed, you want to use <code>conda</code> environments. When you get started, you can put everything in the <code>base</code> environment. Later on, you’ll find this limiting (maybe you’ll have messed up your install with incompatible dependencies after a bit), so you’ll create another environment, perhaps called <code>py3</code>. Later still, you might start creating one environment per project (with its own Github repo!).</p>
<p>Packages that have very specific sets of dependencies will sometimes ask you to recreate an environment <em>exactly</em>. In that case, follow the instructions to the letter; the package probably needs an old version of a package or has esoteric system-wide dependencies that you will waste hours trying to track down. <a href="https://github.com/AlexEMG/DeepLabCut/blob/master/conda-environments/README.md">One package that requires this is DeepLabCut</a>.</p>
<h4>Which packages should I install?</h4>
<p>Many of the packages included by default in anaconda are your standard bread-and-butter for data science, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>matplotlib for plotting</li>
<li>numpy for matrices</li>
<li>scipy for signal processing</li>
<li>pandas for dataframes</li>
<li>sklearn for machine learning</li>
</ul>
<p>Each of these packages has millions of users, they are very active and they’re supported by grants and commercial entities. You can rely on them. I also list <a href="https://xcorr.net/2020/02/21/transitioning-away-from-matlab/">well-supported packages for neuroscience</a> in the previous article.</p>
<p>What about more esoteric needs? How do I intuit whether I’m going to waste a bunch of time on a package that doesn’t work? Here are a few heuristics:</p>

<div class="wp-block-jetpack-markdown"><ul>
<li>How many stars does it have on Github (1 in the above picture)? If it has 1k+ stars, it’s a very well-used project. If it’s smaller than 100 – beware.</li>
<li>When is the last commit on Github (2 in the above picture)? If it’s more than a year, chances are the package is abandoned. This may make it difficult to install.</li>
<li>When in doubt, ask! Ask your labmates, on Twitter, on your favorite Discourse or at a local meetup. Use whatever everybody else is using – this way, it will be easier to get support.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Which IDE should I use?</h4>
<p>There are two categories of integrated development environment for Python:</p>
<ol>
<li>Code editors. You edit code that you can run from inside the editor. Code editors will have a file explorer, variables explorer, a plotting window, a console window, a graphical debugger, etc. These programs can approximate more or less faithfully the experience you have with Matlab. In some cases, they offer many, many more features. They run as standalone programs on your computer.</li>
<li>Notebook editors. You edit a visual document consisting of cells that can be run in any arbitrary order. Plots are saved inline and code can be interspersed with formatted text and formulas. Notebooks run inside in your browser and can connect to remote workers (Python doesn’t have to be on your computer, it can be in the cloud).</li>
</ol>
<p>I asked on Twitter what people tend to use, and it’s fairly evenly split. Many commented that they use both code editors and notebook editors in their day-to-day work. If I want to train a deep neural net for example, I might:</p>
<ol>
<li>Write a script in a code editor, testing it on toy data with the built-in command line</li>
<li>Run the script inside of a terminal overnight</li>
<li>Analyze the results inside of a notebook the next day.</li>
</ol>

<p><a href="https://www.datacamp.com/community/tutorials/top-python-ides-for-2019">Here is a very good article that weighs all the different options</a> – it’s long! Here is my current hot take:</p>



<ol><li>Code editors: <a href="https://www.spyder-ide.org/">Spyder is the most bare-bones IDE of the bunch, and approximates Matlab well</a>. It’s a great starter IDE. I love Atom in general but I find <a href="https://nteract.gitbooks.io/hydrogen/docs/Installation.html">Hydrogen</a>‘s lack of a console limiting. I prefer <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/">VSCode</a> with <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/languages/python">the Python extension</a>. <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/">PyCharm</a> is by far the most advanced editor, with intelligent inferences on your code and automated fixes that feel like magic. It can also be overwhelming because it has so many features, and it also isn’t free (a license is 89$ a year). If you spend 8 hours a day doing Python, PyCharm might the editor for you.</li><li>Notebook editors: <a href="https://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/en/stable/">Jupyterlab</a> does everything jupyter does and more. <a href="https://colab.research.google.com/notebooks/intro.ipynb#recent=true">Colab</a> adds sharing capabilities, and you can use a <a href="https://cloud.google.com/tpu/docs/colabs">free-tier TPU</a> with it.</li></ol>



<h4>Which GUI toolkit should I use?</h4>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="" class="wp-image-7290" data-attachment-id="7290" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-description="" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="gui-toolkits" data-large-file="https://xcorr.files.wordpress.com/2020/02/gui-toolkits.png?w=723" data-medium-file="https://xcorr.files.wordpress.com/2020/02/gui-toolkits.png?w=300" data-orig-file="https://xcorr.files.wordpress.com/2020/02/gui-toolkits.png" data-orig-size="1030,526" data-permalink="https://xcorr.net/2020/02/29/orienting-yourself-through-python/gui-toolkits/" src="https://xcorr.files.wordpress.com/2020/02/gui-toolkits.png?w=723" /></figure>



<p>I asked on Twitter recently, and it seems that many people are choosing <a href="https://wiki.python.org/moin/PyQt">PyQt5</a> to build desktop applications. Qt has a very nice builder to graphically design your GUI, as well as code generators to eliminate writing your own boilerplate. wxPython is also well-loved for larger-scale applications, while tkinter doesn’t have quite all the knobs and options you’d want for a fully-fledged app.</p>



<h4>PyTorch or Tensorflow?</h4>



<p>That’s a tough one! I’ve worked with both in a professional setting at Google and Facebook. As an end-user, <a href="https://pytorch.org/">PyTorch</a> is generally considered to be easier to use. <a href="https://tensorflow.org">Tensorflow</a> has a lot of support for advanced features, like probabilistic programming, and is used by downstream libraries for this reason, for example in the up-and-coming PyMC4. If you use Tensorflow, you probably want to start with <a href="https://keras.io/">Keras</a>, which has a higher-level API.</p>



<h4>What about plotting? How do I make nice figures?</h4>



<p><a href="https://matplotlib.org/"><code>matplotlib</code> is the package that most people start with</a>. Its API is very similar to Matlab, by design. It creates plots which are not very aesthetically pleasing, by default, but <a href="https://seaborn.pydata.org/tutorial/aesthetics.html">you can easily improve them by using seaborn’s styling</a>:</p>


<pre class="brush: plain; title: ; notranslate">import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns
sns.set()  # From now on matplotlib will use the seaborn theme.
</pre>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="" class="wp-image-7295" src="https://xcorr.files.wordpress.com/2020/02/aesthetics_7_0.png" /><img alt="" class="wp-image-7295" data-attachment-id="7295" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-description="" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="aesthetics_7_0" data-large-file="https://xcorr.files.wordpress.com/2020/02/aesthetics_7_0.png?w=370" data-medium-file="https://xcorr.files.wordpress.com/2020/02/aesthetics_7_0.png?w=300" data-orig-file="https://xcorr.files.wordpress.com/2020/02/aesthetics_7_0.png" data-orig-size="370,248" data-permalink="https://xcorr.net/2020/02/29/orienting-yourself-through-python/aesthetics_7_0/" src="https://xcorr.files.wordpress.com/2020/02/aesthetics_9_0.png" />Matplotlib plot before and after seaborn styling</figure>



<p>Many other packages build on <code>matplotlib</code>, including:</p>



<ul><li><a href="https://seaborn.pydata.org/"><code>seaborn</code></a>, which includes a number of useful plot types, including violin plots and histograms.</li><li><a href="https://github.com/has2k1/plotnine"><code>plotnine</code></a>, which implements the grammar of graphics (<code>ggplot2</code> in R).</li></ul>



<p>There are a number of up-and-coming visualization libraries that are not using matplotlib under the hood. The one with the most support behind it is <a href="https://github.com/plotly/plotly.py">plotly</a>. It creates interactive plots that can be shared easily, includes support for other languages outside of Python, and is supported commercially by the plotly company.</p>



<h3>Conclusion</h3>



<p>Picking up Python can feel overwhelming as an outsider – so many decisions to make! I was endlessly reading through articles and doing comparison shopping when I was starting out. Picking what others around you are already using will help you get support when you’re starting out. Ask around! Enjoy the ride!</p>

What carers need and how technology can help provide it</a></h4>

<img alt="" class="attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image" height="110" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2020/02/Support_5504-140x110.jpg" style="display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;" width="140" /><p>Family carers are often invisible to the health care system in meeting the care needs of older people. Yet, family carers – people who assist a family member or friend with challenges resulting from illness, disability or aging – <a href="https://healthcouncilcanada.ca/files/HCC_HomeCare_FA.pdf">provide three-quarters of the care older adults receive</a>. Demands on family carers are <a href="https://www.utpjournals.press/doi/abs/10.3138/Q326-4625-5753-K683">increasing</a> as populations age, disability rates increase, and demands on our health and continuing care sectors escalate. In these circumstances, sustainability of family care becomes a pressing issue.</p>
<p>To better understand family caring roles, and how technology might support them, we conducted focus groups and an online survey with carers in Canada. As reported in <a href="https://bmcgeriatr.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12877-020-1455-x?utm_source=bmc_blogs&amp;amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;amp;utm_content=null&amp;amp;utm_campaign=blog_2020_bmcseriesblog">our new study</a> in <a href="https://bmcgeriatr.biomedcentral.com/?utm_source=bmc_blogs&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=null&amp;utm_campaign=blog_2020_bmcseriesblog"><em>BMC Geriatrics</em></a>, we learned that family carers want to enhance the care they currently provide, but they recognize that they have to protect their own capacity to care first.</p>
<h3><strong>Protecting family carers’ well-being</strong></h3>
<img alt="" class="size-medium wp-image-11737 alignleft" height="200" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2020/02/2_0020-300x200.jpg" width="300" />
<p>To protect their own well-being, and their ongoing capacity to provide care, family carers want to take better care of themselves, develop better coping strategies, and have opportunities for mentorship and socialization.</p>
<p>Family carers sought more time and space for themselves as part of their overall sustainability. <a href="https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/tpp/ijcc/2019/00000003/00000003/art00009">Sustainability </a>in this context refers to carers’ ability to balance the demands of caring for their loved ones without jeopardizing their own health, well-being, and quality of life. This is easier said than done as carers struggle to find a few hours to care for themselves as individuals with their own interests and needs while caring for others. Developing better coping strategies and becoming more resilient is a learned skill. Rebalancing the negative and positive aspects of caregiving, focusing on mindfulness, reducing stress, and celebrating small victories can help reframe the emotional experience of caregiving. As one carer put it,</p>
<p><em>“If caregivers had time off, their health would hopefully remain good. Currently, burnout and health implications are inevitable.”</em></p>
<p>Yet, at times, family carers feel guilty about putting their own needs first. They want <em>“better networking with other caregivers, sharing our stories to make things easier,” </em>and reducing the social isolation they often experience.</p>
<h3><strong>Enhancing family carers’ capacity to provide quality care</strong></h3>
<p>To enhance caregiving capacity, family carers want information about their care receivers’ conditions to help them plan, and the ability to navigate existing resources, programs and supports.</p>
<p>Knowing “what comes next” is a central desire for many family carers, so that they can plan for an unpredictable future, manage expectations, and make informed decisions. Having this sense of control contributes to their overall well-being. One carer wished for</p>
<p><em>“…a crystal ball so I know what the future might look like, so I can prepare more for what might be required as we go forward.”</em></p>
<p>Family carers also feel lost, navigating fragmented health and social support services without a road map. They may not know what supports and programs are available or whether they qualify for any they do know about. Making sense of the flood of online information is overwhelming in the face of family carers’ time-consuming care responsibilities. Another carer described the situation as follows:</p>
<p><em>“It is like a library with the books in a pile on the floor and no card catalogue to even let me know where to start.”</em></p>
<h3><strong>Targeted technology development can help carers achieve their goals</strong></h3>
<img alt="" class="size-medium wp-image-11738 alignright" height="199" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2020/02/Jacquie-and-Gigi-Dec04_51040-300x199.jpg" width="300" />
<p>When considering technology development to support carers, traditional problem‐focused approaches to technology design can limit discussions to performing caregiving tasks, failing to capture the relational and emotional aspects of caregiving. While technology is not the panacea that product developers and policy makers hope for, family carers did offer suggestions about how they are, or could be, using technology to enhance and preserve their caregiving capacity. Some carers use off-the-shelf technology to support their caregiving.</p>
<p><em>“My [Smart] watch tells me to breathe. It tells me to stand. Honestly. Sometimes it gets me up and I take a moment. I breathe.”</em></p>
<p>Other family carers thought of ways to modify existing technology to make it support their goals. They imagined:</p>
<ul>
<li>Private internet-based chat rooms or interactive apps for information exchange.</li>
<li>A comprehensive, searchable repository of available supports that can yield individually tailored ‘system’ navigation.</li>
<li>Advanced search engines that use artificial intelligence to organize, evaluate, synthesize and summarize large amounts of information available from the internet.</li>
<li>Smart watches that monitor blood pressure or heart rate and proactively offer calming or stress reducing activities and techniques.</li>
<li>Interactive smart phone applications, like Siri, to help carers problem-solve and find solutions to in-the-moment issues like dealing with care receivers’ challenging behaviors.</li>
<li>Networking applications or online portals to connect family carers to mentors, counselors and each other.</li>
<li>Telephone information services to point family carers to services, supports and guidance along their care journeys.</li>
<li>Systems that connect carers, providing opportunities for socialization, recreation and reducing social isolation.</li>
</ul>
<p>Of course, technology alone is not enough to sustain family care work. According to University of Birmingham social policy professor Paul Burstow, “<a href="https://www.healtheuropa.eu/benefits-technology-enabled-care/87408/">getting the balance right between ‘tech’ and ‘touch’ is vital</a>.” The insights gained from our work are an important first step in achieving this balance by understanding carers’ goals and figuring out how to support them in meaningful ways.</p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Open science should be boosted in 2020 as the number of journals with research data policies increases as a result of collective action by publishers, who are </span></i><a href="https://www.stm-researchdata.org/getting-started/"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">being encouraged</span></i></a><i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to adopt a </span></i><a href="http://doi.org/10.5334/dsj-2020-005"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">new common framework for journal data policies</span></i></a><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">. PLOS is the first publisher to align the policies of all its journals with this new framework</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><b>Context</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To enable reproducible research we need transparent and accessible research outputs. And, as an enabler of reproducibility, transparency is what we – journals and publishers – can reasonably ask for, or even demand. Asking for transparency can begin not with new or sophisticated technology, but with a relatively low tech solution: policy.  Introducing a policy on research data sharing is a logical first step to raising awareness of an issue and beginning to create change. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Policies have been in place for sharing some specific kinds of research data (such as protein structural data and genetic sequences) for a quarter of a century or more. Since 2014, PLOS has led the way with a </span><a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/s/data-availability"><span style="font-weight: 400;">mandatory data availability policy</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for all our articles, and since 2016 </span><a href="https://insights.uksg.org/articles/10.1629/uksg.463/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">most larger publishers</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> – Springer Nature, Elsevier, Wiley, Taylor &amp; Francis – have introduced tiered data policy initiatives. Coupled with discipline-specific policy initiatives, such as </span><a href="http://www.copdess.org/enabling-fair-data-project/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">in Earth sciences</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, this means thousands of journals now have a data policy of some kind.</span></p>
<p><b>Making a statement about data</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">An important tool, used by PLOS and others, for introducing a consistent data policy is a data availability statement in every published article. These statements indicate if, how and where the data supporting claims made in an article are available. Many journal and publisher research data policies still make data sharing and data availability statements optional rather than mandatory, but we welcome this steady progress on open research policies in the scholarly publishing community.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since mandating data sharing and data availability statements in 2014, PLOS has published more than 127,000</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">articles with a data availability statement and </span><a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194768"><span style="font-weight: 400;">more</span></a> <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.02565"><span style="font-weight: 400;">than</span></a> <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0229578"><span style="font-weight: 400;">one</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> study has analysed them. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Requiring a new section in every article published incurs costs, which at PLOS we see as a worthwhile investment in open research. It </span><a href="http://www.ijdc.net/article/view/614"><span style="font-weight: 400;">takes time</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, training and resources for editors, authors, peer reviewers and editorial office staff, so mandating these statements is understandably a consideration for other publishers of thousands of articles per year.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There is growing recognition </span><a href="https://zenodo.org/record/1476871#.XjLptGj7S72"><span style="font-weight: 400;">from funders</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, academic societies, editorial groups such as the ICMJE, that data availability statements are a practical, achievable and meaningful improvement to support transparency in research.</span></p>
<p><b>Wider adoption in 2020</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The growth rate of journal research data policies is likely to increase with the launch, in January 2020, of the STM Association’s </span><a href="https://www.stm-researchdata.org/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">STM research data year</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which has an objective to increase the number of journals with data policies and articles with data availability statements. Progress on policy implementation will be tracked across thousands of journals (STM is a publishing industry association with more than 120 organisational members). This feels like a turning point in open research policy.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The STM Association is recommending the use of a</span><a href="http://doi.org/10.5334/dsj-2020-005"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> common policy framework for journal research data policy</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to promote consistent approaches to journal research data policies, at its wide variety of members.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The policy framework – </span><a href="http://doi.org/10.5334/dsj-2020-005"><span style="font-weight: 400;">published </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">last week in a peer-reviewed journal after being </span><a href="https://figshare.com/articles/Developing_a_research_data_policy_framework_for_all_journals_and_publishers/8223365/1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">available as a preprint</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> – is an output of an initiative, begun in 2016, </span><a href="https://www.rd-alliance.org/groups/data-policy-standardisation-and-implementation-ig"><span style="font-weight: 400;">within the Research Data Alliance organisation</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The framework includes 14 features, or common elements, of journal research data policies – including data citation, data repositories, and data peer review – and reusable policy text for journal editors and publishers to implement on their journals.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2019, we compared PLOS’ data availability policy to this framework and, as a first step, updated some of the language, such as to give </span><a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/s/data-availability#loc-data-management-plans"><span style="font-weight: 400;">explicit support for sharing Data Management Plans</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (DMPs) – a document increasingly required in funding agency data policies. In doing so, PLOS continues to lead the way, by being the first publisher, to our knowledge, to align its entire journal portfolio with this new framework. As well increasing data sharing, another anticipated benefit of harmonising policy is reducing the burden on researchers and support staff with different or conflicting requirements between journals, and funders. The framework also provides future opportunities to review data policy language to ensure requirements are easily understood.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We’re looking forward to collaborating with publishers and researchers to continue driving up standards for transparency and openness in research in 2020.</span></p>

<p>The lack of a formal link between neural network structure and its emergent function
has hampered our understanding of how the brain processes information. We have now come
closer to describing such a link by taking the direction of synaptic transmission into
account, constructing graphs of a network that reflect the direction of information
flow, and analyzing these directed graphs using algebraic topology. Applying this
approach to a local network of neurons in the neocortex revealed a remarkably intricate
and previously unseen topology of synaptic connectivity. The synaptic network contains
an abundance of cliques of neurons bound into cavities that guide the emergence of
correlated activity. In response to stimuli, correlated activity binds synaptically
connected neurons into functional cliques and cavities that evolve in a stereotypical
sequence toward peak complexity. We propose that the brain processes stimuli by forming
increasingly complex functional cliques and cavities.</p>

This results in the formation of 3D cell-clusters which replicate many organ-of-origin characteristics. Current efforts to develop human organoid models will help us understand more about how our organs are formed and function and how to help in cases where diseases occur.</p>

The pancreas is located alongside the stomach and plays a critical role in our digestive system. Three main cell types are found in the pancreas; <strong>1) endocrine cells</strong> which reside in the islets of Langerhans and produce hormones including insulin that control sugar metabolism in our bodies, <strong>2) acinar cells</strong> which produce digestive enzymes and <strong>3) pancreatic ductal cells</strong> that form ducts (highlighted in figure 1) to collect the digestive enzymes and transport them to the small intestine to aid with the breakdown of food.</p>

<p>Malfunction of these cells is associated with a series of pancreatic diseases. Pancreatic cancer can affect any of these cell types and has the <a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanonc/article/PIIS1470-2045(19)30456-5/fulltext">lowest survival rate in the UK</a> among all cancer types.  Diabetes is the most common disease of the endocrine compartment and affects over <a href="https://www.diabetes.co.uk/diabetes-prevalence.html">4 million people in the UK</a>.  Other serious diseases, although perhaps less well known, include pancreatitis (inflammation of the pancreas), cystic fibrosis (which affects ductal cells) and pancreatic insufficiency (reduced acinar cell function). Severe cases of pancreatic disease often leave patients with the need for a pancreas or islet cell transplant deriving from deceased organ donors. However, the greatest hurdles to pancreas transplants include a limited number of organ donors and a need for life-time immunosuppression.</p>
<p>We aimed to produce a 3D culture system for long-term expansion of hPOs to serve as the basis for studies of pancreas ductal cells, pancreatic diseases and the development of cell therapy for diabetes. Whilst developing the hPO model we were aware that for a cell therapy to translate into the clinic it must meet certain criteria which include cell expansion in a chemically defined manner that is compatible with Good Manufacturing Processes (GMP) with strong evidence that the cells pose no risk of tumour formation.</p>
<p>To generate hPOs, we isolated ductal fragments from small samples of human pancreatic tissue and placed these in an ECM to act as a 3D scaffold. In order for this to be successful we had to develop a culture medium which would include all the signals and growth factors required to support the transition of pancreatic ducts into expandable pancreas organoids (Figure 2). Through a series of optimisations and iterations in which we tested activators and inhibitors of key cell signalling pathways we achieved a chemically defined culture medium that sustains the long-term culture of the pancreas cells. In addition, we developed a protocol to freeze the pancreatic tissue and recover healthy long-term expanding organoids from it. This gives us the ability to bank tissue, share samples and derive organoids at a later date.</p>
<figure class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_11730" style="width: 664px;"><img alt="" class=" wp-image-11730" height="375" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2020/02/pancreas-2-300x172.jpg" width="654" /><div class="attachment-image--caption">Figure 2: Human pancreatic ducts can be cultured in vitro and expanded as pancreatic organoids.</div><div class="attachment-image--source"></div></figure>
<p>Importantly, genetic analysis showed that even after long-term expansion the hPOs did not show large genetic abnormalities. This is crucial, as accumulation of genetic defects during culturing, can alter cellular behaviours and impact on the results. We also found that upon transplant of these cells into mouse pancreas the hPO cells do not form tumours, indicating their genetic safety both in vitro and in vivo.</p>
<p>Finally, we aimed to develop a chemically defined ECM in which to culture hPOs as the commonly used ECMs (Matrigel and BME 2-RGF) are animal-derived and are unsuitable for cell therapies. In collaboration with <a href="https://www.cellendes.com/">Cellendes</a>, a company specialised in hydrogel technology, we could show for the first time the derivation and expansion of hPOs in a fully chemically defined hydrogel.</p>
<p>Our demonstration of the long-term expansion of human pancreas organoids in chemically defined conditions makes this an exciting system for many areas of research (Figure 3). This system can be used as a model of healthy ductal pancreas biology and the development of disease models of the ductal compartment, such as cystic fibrosis. Organoids can also be derived from diseased states and have already been used to model different types of <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S009286741401592X?via%3Dihub">pancreatic cancer</a> (PDAC and IPMN).</p>
<figure class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_11731" style="width: 615px;"><img alt="" class=" wp-image-11731" height="222" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2020/02/pancreas-3-300x110.jpg" width="605" /><div class="attachment-image--caption">Figure 3: Human pancreatic organoids have the potential to be used in many areas of research such as investigations into healthy tissue, diseased tissue and regenerative medicine.</div><div class="attachment-image--source"></div></figure>
<p>Critically, our protocol does not rely on altering the genome or identity of the cells in order to achieve long-term expansion. This, combined with the lack of tumour formation when transplanted into mice, makes hPOs a safe approach for potential cell therapies. Cell therapies offer hope for patients without available curative treatment options. They provide the possibility of treating a disease by extracting cells from the patient or other donors, altering them in the lab to generate working cells and transplanting them into the patient. In theory, this would treat the disease while removing the need for immunosuppression as the cells would be either self-derived or very closely matched to the patient.</p>
<p>The adaptation of the culture system for human cells was funded by an EU programme (LSFM4LIFE) which aims at investigating the potential of hPOs as a clinical cell therapy. Whether hPOs could be the source for a cell therapy transplantation for diabetes remains to be investigated.</p>

<img alt="" class="attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image" height="110" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2020/02/slimming-2728331_640-140x110.jpg" style="display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;" width="140" /><p>We all have some knowledge about how to lose weight, but this does not often change what we do. Using formal weight loss services can be effective in helping people who want to lose weight. In most parts of the UK, people who want to lose weight can be referred to an evidence-based group or a one-to-one weight loss program.</p>
<p>However, engagement of men in these weight loss programs is low. Men make up 11-25% of people who go to Counterweight, Weight Watchers, Slimming World and Rosemary Conley Diet and Fitness Clubs. With a greater prevalence overweight men compared to women in the UK, and rising obesity rates globally, this lack of engagement is concerning.</p>
<p>Our study, published in <em>BMC Public Health</em>, sought to understand what influences the engagement of men in weight loss services.</p>
<p><strong><u>Study findings</u></strong></p>
<blockquote><p><em>Only me and two other guys and about 40 women [at Weight Watchers], which is a bit off-putting</em></p></blockquote>
<p>Through interviews with 18 men with different experiences of weight loss programs (from not taking part to repeated engagers) we identified two key themes: <strong><em>Fear as a motivation for change</em></strong> and <strong><em>Attitudes towards existing weight loss services</em>.<br />
</strong></p>
<p>Theme 1: <strong><em>Fear as a motivation for change:</em></strong>  A medical diagnosis, coupled with instructions and a referral from a healthcare professional, triggered feelings of fear and worry, which motivated men to engage with weight loss programs. Awareness of severe alternative treatments, irreversible damage caused by obesity and impaired mobility were also key motivators:</p>
<p><em>“My weight had gone up to 160kg … and my GP hinted at, well you don’t want to carry on putting on weight because you might have to have a gastric band </em><em>and I said no, we’re not going to go there</em><em>” [Participant 2]</em></p>
<p>Seeing the effects of long-term weight problems on family members often boosted men’s personal motivation and helped them to understand how severe their situation was:</p>
<p><em>“I lost my sister-in-law … for her whole life she had a massive weight problem, and I put it down, you know, at the end it cost her life” [Participant 8]</em></p>
<p>Theme 2:<strong><em> Attitudes towards existing weight loss services:</em></strong>  Although these medical triggers and fears were powerful, men were still often reluctant to join in or stick with weight loss programs. Two sub-themes may explain why:</p>
<p>Subtheme 1: <em><strong>Female-dominated services:</strong></em>  Men often found themselves in the minority, provoking feelings of self-consciousness and embarrassment, particularly due to the weight loss context:</p>
<p><em>“Only me and two other guys and about 40 women [at Weight Watchers], which is a bit off-putting” [Participant 4]</em></p>
<p>Some men felt that the female-dominated weight loss service threatened their identity and participating or worrying about weight was not perceived as a ‘manly’ thing to do; men also reported a lack of social support from discussing weight with peers:</p>
<p><em>“I think it’s just the stigma that’s attached to it for weight loss for men, they think it’s more of a woman’s thing to lose weight and worry about their weight” [Participant 7]</em></p>
<p>Subtheme 2: <em><strong>Incompatibility of existing services for men:</strong>  </em>Often, available services were not what the men wanted; programs that focused on discussing weight and praising weight loss were seen as intrusive and overbearing. This often led to men not taking part, only partially engaging or dropping out altogether.</p>
<p><em>“All clap each other and that, that doesn’t work for me, because that’s quite embarrassing for me. They have like a slimmer of the week and all that stuff, that doesn’t work for me” [P13, Repeater, Commercial]</em></p>
<p><strong><u>Implications for practice</u></strong></p>
<p><img alt="" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-11727" height="195" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2020/02/exercise-300x195.jpg" width="300" />Men in the study discussed strong motivations to lose weight, triggered by fear resulting from a medical diagnosis or complication. The findings highlight the importance of healthcare professionals raising the issue of weight with patients. However, men are less likely to visit the GP compared to women, so engaging men in alternative, non-medicalized settings, is also vital.</p>
<p>Findings that existing services are perceived to be female-dominated and misalign with men’s preferences emphasize the importance of providing a variety of service formats (e.g. men-only, mixed groups, one-to-one), which may be more compatible and satisfactory for men.</p>
<p>Understanding motivations and barriers to engaging is key to addressing them and reducing rising rates of obesity, overweight and associated weight-related health problems.</p>
