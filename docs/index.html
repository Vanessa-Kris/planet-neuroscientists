                <p>I&#8217;m glad to share that I am going to start my own junior research group at the University of Zurich in March 2023!</p>



<p>As an <a href="https://www.snf.ch/en/N18L3oGWomTSSGkF/funding/careers/ambizione">Ambizione</a> fellow, I will receive funding for my own salary, some equipment, consumables and a PhD student (total of ca. 900k CHF). There will be possibilities to recruit more students, but I will try to start small, so that I can spend my time with my students, experiments and data analysis and less so with buraucratic obligations that come with other positions. The general research direction of my group is already reflected by some write-ups of previous years (<em><a href="https://ptrrupprecht.wordpress.com/2018/12/30/annual-report-of-my-intuition-about-the-brain/">2018</a>, <a href="https://ptrrupprecht.wordpress.com/2019/12/31/annual-report-of-my-intuition-about-the-brain-2019/">2019</a>, <a href="https://ptrrupprecht.wordpress.com/2021/01/01/annual-report-of-my-intuition-about-the-brain-2020/">2020</a>, <a href="https://gcamp6f.com/2021/12/31/annual-report-2021/">2021</a></em>). There will be a focus on single neurons, plasticity, possibly also dendrites, and closed-loop paradigms.</p>



<p>My group will benefit from being part of the <a href="https://www.hifo.uzh.ch/en/research/helmchen.html">lab of Fritjof Helmchen</a>. Working with all the resources and experts available in the Helmchen Lab, and at the same time being supervised by myself is probably not bad combination!</p>



<p>So if you&#8217;re finishing your Master&#8217;s right now and are looking for a PhD position, or if you have a talented Master&#8217;s student who would be a good fit for my group, get in touch with me. Here&#8217;s the official position opening:</p>



<p><strong>Project description</strong></p>



<p>The SNSF AMBIZIONE junior group of <strong><em>Dr. Peter Rupprecht</em></strong> at the Brain Research Institute, University of Zurich, Switzerland (starting 1.3.2023), is offering a PhD position to study neuronal circuits in the living mouse brain. The goal of the project is to understand how a single neuron learns about the effect of its action potentials. The project therefore addresses the problem of “credit assignment” in the brain experimentally.</p>



<p>The project will be conducted in the lab of and officially supervised by <strong><em>Prof. Fritjof Helmchen</em></strong>. Working on this project will therefore provide ample opportunity to collaborate with and learn from some of the best neuroscientists.</p>



<p>The methods to drive this project will be, among others, <em>in vivo</em> calcium imaging of neuronal activity, <em>in vivo</em> cell-attached recordings, closed-loop virtual realities, and advanced data analysis methods. You will be able to select your favorite sub-projects and techniques from this spectrum, and you will receive direct guidance from Peter Rupprecht to learn anything that is required.</p>



<p><strong>Requirements</strong></p>



<p>You have studied neuroscience, physics, biology, informatics or a related field. You are familiar with or eager to learn the techniques required for this project, including elements of microscopy, mouse handling, electrophysiology, programming and data analysis in Python and/or Matlab. Ideally, you enjoy solving problems, even if it takes long and the problems are difficult. Some programming skills or the strong desire to acquire such are important for any kind of project in this lab.</p>



<p><strong>Application guideline</strong></p>



<p>Please send your application including a CV and your transcript of records to Peter Rupprecht (<a href="mailto:rupprecht@hifo.uzh.ch">rupprecht@hifo.uzh.ch</a>). Please include a letter of motivation that covers the following aspects: What talents or previous experience of yours are possibly relevant to this project? What would you like to learn and achieve during your PhD? Do you enjoy writing in English? If you have coding or experimental experience, describe your most challenging previous program or project.</p>



<p><strong>Starting date</strong></p>



<p>The PhD position is available starting March 2023.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/mountain-lions-wildfires-risks-road-crossing">Mountain lions pushed out by wildfires take more risks</a></h4>

              
                <p>Mountain lions have no interest in people, or the built-up areas we enjoy. But after a 2018 wildfire in California, local lions took more risks, <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0960982222014762" target="_blank" rel="noopener">crossing roads more often and moving around more in the daytime</a>, scientists report October 20 in <em>Current Biology</em>. It’s another way the effects of human development could be putting pressure on vulnerable wildlife — in this case, potentially pushing them toward our bumpers.</p>



<p>The Woolsey Fire began near Los Angeles on November 8, 2018, and burned more than 36,000 hectares in the Santa Monica Mountains. Nearly 300,000 people evacuated, and three people died. Animals fled the fire too, including the local mountain lions (<em>Puma concolor</em>). The fire was a tragedy, but also a scientific opportunity, says Rachel Blakey, a global change biologist at UCLA. Many of the lions wore tracking collars, allowing scientists to study how the fire changed their behavior.</p>





<p>Of the 11 collared cougars in the area at the time, nine made it to safety during the fire itself. “They have really large home ranges, so it&#8217;s nothing to them to be able to cover many kilometers in a day,” Blakey says.</p>



<p>No matter how much they moved, the mountain lions avoided people. One collared cat, P-64, initially fled the fire — until he got close to a developed area. Given the choice between fire and people, the lion retreated back into the burning area. “That’s where his movements stopped,” Blakey says. The park service later found P-64’s remains. He&#8217;d burned his paws, and it’s possible that he was unable to hunt and starved to death.</p>



<p>Using data from the nine lions that survived the fire and others collared after, the scientists showed that the cats generally avoided the severely burned areas of their territories. With vegetation gone, the cats had little cover for stalking and ambushing prey.</p>



<p>Instead, the cougars stuck to unburned areas, and continued to avoid people. But they took more risks around human infrastructure, increasing their road crossings from an average of about three times per month to five. </p>

<p>These weren’t all two-lane country highways. The first collared lion to successfully cross Interstate 405, which has 10 lanes in places, did it after the Woolsey Fire. And the big cats crossed U.S. Route 101 once every four months, whereas before the fire, they’d crossed only once every two years. Their territories also overlapped more often, increasing the potential for deadly encounters between the solitary cats. And the generally nocturnal animals increased activity during daytime hours from 10 percent to 16 percent of their active time — boosting a lion’s chances of potentially bump into a human.</p>



<p>Road crossing is what Blakey calls a “risk mismatch.” Lions in areas with lots of people appear to weigh the risk of encountering humans as more dangerous. But “running across a freeway is a lot more likely to be fatal,” she says. That risk, combined with the risk of running into other cats, can be deadly. One young, collared male ended up dead on a freeway in the months after the fire. He was fleeing a fight with an older, uncollared male. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Intense burns like the Woolsey Fire highlight the resilience of mountain lions, says Winston Vickers, a wildlife research veterinarian at the University of California, Davis who was not involved in the study. “They have amazing mobility, they mostly can get away from the immediate fire, they mostly survive,” he notes. The changes in risk-taking, he says, could reflect how confined the population is, hemmed into the mountains by human development.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/blog/wild-things/animals-get-safe-spots-cross-road-and-car-collisions-drop">Wildlife crossings</a>, such as the new Wallis Annenberg Wildlife Crossing over the 101, will hopefully give the mountain lions a safer option for roaming, though the main goal is to promote gene flow between lion populations, Blakey says (<em>SN: 5/31/16</em>). In a landscape where fire, humans and highways combine, it’s good to have somewhere to run. &nbsp;</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/boat-brightest-gamma-ray-burst-supernova">Meet the BOAT, the brightest gamma-ray burst of all time</a></h4>

              
                <p>The brightest gamma-ray burst ever recorded recently lit up a distant galaxy — and astronomers have nicknamed it the BOAT, for Brightest of All Time.</p>



<p>“We use the boat emoji a lot when we’re talking about it” on the messaging app Slack, says astronomer Jillian Rastinejad of Northwestern University in Evanston, Ill.</p>



<p>Gamma-ray bursts are <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/how-two-gamma-ray-bursts-created-record-breaking-high-energy-photons" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">energetic explosions</a> that go off when a massive star dies and leaves behind a <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/short-gamma-ray-burst-star-core-collapse-explosion" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">black hole</a> or neutron star (<em>SN: 11/20/19; SN: 8/2/21</em>). The collapse sets off jets of gamma rays zipping away from the poles of the former star. If those jets happen to be pointed right at Earth, astronomers can see them as a gamma-ray burst.</p>





<p>This <a href="https://svs.gsfc.nasa.gov/14227" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">new burst</a>, officially named GRB 221009A, was probably triggered by a supernova giving birth to a black hole in a galaxy about 2 billion light-years from Earth, researchers announced October 13. Astronomers think it released as much energy as roughly three suns converting all of their mass to pure energy.</p>



<p>NASA’s Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory, a gamma-ray telescope in space, automatically detected the blast October 9 around 10:15 a.m. EDT, and promptly alerted astronomers <a href="https://www.astronomerstelegram.org/?read=15650" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">that something strange was happening</a>.</p>



<p>“At the time, when it went off, it looked kind of weird to us,” says Penn State astrophysicist Jamie Kennea, who is the head of science operations for Swift. The blast’s position in the sky seemed to line up with the plane of the Milky Way. So at first Kennea and colleagues thought it was within our own galaxy, and so unlikely to be something as dramatically energetic as a gamma-ray burst. If a burst like this went off inside the Milky Way, it would be visible to the naked eye, which wasn’t the case.</p>



<p>But soon Kennea learned that NASA’s Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope had also seen the flash — and it was one of the brightest things the telescope had ever seen. A fresh look at the Swift data convinced Kennea and colleagues that the flash was the brightest gamma-ray burst seen in the 50 years of observing these rare explosions.</p>



<p>“It’s quite exceptional,” Kennea says. “It stands head and shoulders above the rest.”</p>

Cenko</span></figcaption></figure></div>


<p>After confirmation of the burst’s BOAT bonafides — a term coined by Rastinejad’s adviser, Northwestern astronomer Wen-fai Fong — other astronomers rushed to get a look. Within days, scientists around the world got a glimpse of the blast with telescopes in space and on the ground, in nearly every type of light. Even some radio telescopes typically used as lightning detectors saw a <a href="https://gcn.gsfc.nasa.gov/gcn3/32745.gcn3" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">sudden disturbance associated with GRB 221009A</a>, suggesting that the burst stripped electrons from atoms in Earth’s atmosphere.</p>



<p>In the hours and days after the initial explosion, the burst subsided and gave way to a still relatively bright afterglow. Eventually, astronomers expect to see it fade&nbsp;even more, replaced by glowing ripples of material in the supernova remnant.</p>



<p>The extreme brightness was probably at least partially due to GRB 221009A’s relative proximity, Kennea says. A couple billion light-years might seem far, but the average gamma-ray burst is more like 10 billion light-years away. It probably was also just intrinsically bright, though there hasn’t been time to figure out why.</p>



<p>Studying the blast as it changes is “probably going to challenge some of our assumptions of how gamma-ray bursts work,” Kennea says. “I think people who are gamma-ray burst theorists are going to be inundated with so much data that this is going to change theories that they thought were pretty solid.”</p>



<p>GRB 221009A will move behind the sun from Earth’s perspective starting in late November, shielding it temporarily from view. But because its glow is still so bright now, astronomers are hopeful that they’ll still be able to see it when it becomes visible again in February.</p>



<p>“I’m so excited for a few months from now when we have all the beautiful data,” Rastinejad says.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/treatment-nightmares-sleep">A new treatment for debilitating nightmares offers sweeter dreams</a></h4>

              
                <p>For people haunted by recurring nightmares, untroubled sleep would be a dream come true. Now in a small experiment, neuroscientists have demonstrated a technique that, for some, may chase the bad dreams away.</p>



<p><a></a>Enhancing the standard treatment for nightmare disorder with a memory-boosting technique cut down average weekly nightmares among a few dozen people <a href="https://www.cell.com/current-biology/fulltext/S0960-9822(22)01477-4" target="_blank" rel="noopener">from three to near zero</a>, researchers report online October 27 in <em>Current Biology</em>.</p>



<p>“The fact that they could actually make a big difference in the frequency of those nightmares is huge,” says Gina Poe, a neuroscientist at UCLA who wasn’t involved in the study.</p>





<p><a></a>People with nightmare disorder fear the night not for the monsters under the bed, but the monsters in their dreams. Frequent, terrifying dreams disturb sleep and even affect well-being in waking life. The go-to nightmare disorder treatment is imagery rehearsal therapy, or IRT. In this treatment, patients reimagine nightmares with a positive spin, mentally rehearsing the new story line while awake. It reduces nightmares for most but fails for nearly a third of people.</p>



<p><a></a>To boost IRT’s power, neuroscientist Sophie Schwartz of the University of Geneva and her colleagues leveraged a learning technique called targeted memory reactivation, or TMR. In this technique, a person focuses on learning something while a sound plays, and that same cue plays again during sleep. Experiencing the cue during sleep, which is <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/brain-waves-sleep-learning-memory-remember-forget">important for memory storage</a>, may reactivate and strengthen the associated memory (<em>SN: 10/3/19</em>).</p>



<p><a></a>In the new study, the researchers gave 36 people with nightmare disorder training in IRT, randomly assigning half of them to rehearse their revised nightmares in silence. The other half rehearsed while a short piano chord, the TMR cue, played every 10 seconds for five minutes.</p>



<p><a></a>For two weeks, participants practiced IRT daily and kept a dream diary. While they slept, a headband outfitted with sensors recorded their brains’ electrical activity and tracked their sleep stages. The piano chord served as a dream soundtrack, with the headband sounding off every 10 seconds during rapid eye movement, the sleep stage associated with dreaming. The headband played the sound for all participants, but only half had come to associate the sound with their new scenario during the IRT training.</p>



<p><a></a>For those trained on the chord, TMR nearly vanquished the nightmares, bringing the weekly average down from three to 0.2, and even encouraged happier dreams. The group that received only IRT improved too, but still averaged one weekly nightmare.</p>



<p><a></a>The TMR-IRT combination also had more staying power after three months, with that group’s average rising only slightly from about 0.2 to 0.3 nightmares a week, while the IRT-only group’s jumped to 1.5.</p>



<p><a></a>Larger studies will need to test how generalizable this treatment combination is. This study featured a small number of people, all young adults ages 20 to 35 who had nightmare disorder and no other psychiatric conditions. The study also didn’t compare IRT and TMR to no treatment, although the researchers write that previous studies have already shown how effective IRT can be.</p>



<p><a></a>If a TMR-IRT combo proves as strong in future research, it still has a way to go before it’s widely accessible. Commercially available sleep trackers in watches and rings have yet to distinguish between sleep stages as accurately as brain-monitoring tools.</p>



<p><a></a>Even with these caveats, the results are encouraging, Poe says. She suggests that future studies could test whether the TMR-IRT combination can help people with <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/blog/scicurious/ptsd-good-nights-sleep-means-feeling-safe">post-traumatic stress disorder</a>, or PTSD, where nightmares rehash traumatic events (<em>SN 9/12/14)</em>.</p>



<p>That’s something Schwartz wants to try. “I’m not sure we’ll succeed with these particular patients,” she says. “But if we do, this would be a really important addition to the methods we have for treating PTSD.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/whiskey-flavor-gold-ions-chemistry">Mixing gold ions into whiskey can reveal its flavor</a></h4>

              
                <p>A new kind of “gold standard” could soon permeate the whiskey industry.</p>



<p>Whiskey distillers typically <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/american-whiskeys-leave-unique-webs-when-evaporated">age spirits in charred, wooden casks</a> for years, allowing the liquor to gradually absorb flavorful chemicals released from the wood (<em>SN: 10/31/19</em>). Now, researchers have demonstrated that swirling gold ions into a whiskey can reveal how much flavor the liquor has taken in — a quality called agedness. The method could provide master blenders with a <a href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/full/10.1021/acsanm.2c03406" target="_blank" rel="noopener">quick and inexpensive test for whiskey agedness</a>, researchers report October 6 in <em>ACS Applied Nano Materials</em>.</p>





<p>“A tiny amount of gold gives you this really bright, strong, red or blue or purple color,” says William Peveler, a chemist at the University of Glasgow in Scotland. The stronger the color, and the quicker that color arises, the more aged the whiskey, he says.</p>



<p>Master blenders sometimes conduct tasting sessions to gauge agedness, but this process can be labor intensive. Alternatively, laboratory assays can measure agedness by checking whiskeys for flavorful chemicals called congeners, absorbed from wood casks, but such analyses can be expensive.</p>



<p>Past research has shown that various chemicals, from <a href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/ac048691v" target="_blank" rel="noopener">neurotransmitters</a> to <a href="https://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlelanding/2020/ay/c9ay01942a/unauth" target="_blank" rel="noopener">poor-tasting compounds in maple syrup</a>, could trigger gold ions in a solution to coalesce into ultra-tiny gold nuggets, or nanoparticles. So Peveler and colleagues mixed solutions containing less than a penny’s worth of gold ions into different whiskey blends and a vodka. While no nanoparticles formed in the vodka, the ions reacted with whiskey congeners to form nanoparticles in minutes. The size and shape of the nanoparticles varied between whiskeys, causing the spirits to flourish with different colors.</p>



<p><a></a>The researchers plan to further investigate how gold nanoparticles grow alongside alcohols and sugars in whiskeys to develop an even more comprehensive test for agedness.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/muon-particles-cosmic-rays-inside-cyclones-weather">Particles from space provide a new look inside cyclones</a></h4>

              
                <p>Particles raining down from space offer 3-D views inside swirling tropical storms.</p>



<p>Muons created from cosmic rays that smash into Earth’s upper atmosphere have <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-022-20039-4" target="_blank" rel="noopener">revealed the inner workings of cyclones</a> over Japan, researchers report October 6 in <em>Scientific Reports</em>. The new imaging approach could lead to a better understanding of storms, the researchers say, and offer another tool to help meteorologists forecast the weather.</p>



<p>“Cosmic rays are sustainable natural resources that can be used everywhere on this planet for 24 hours [a day],” says geophysicist Hiroyuki Tanaka of the University of Tokyo, so it’s just a matter of taking advantage of them.</p>





<p>Muons offer a glimpse inside storms because variations in air pressure and density change the number of particles that make it through a tempest. By counting how many muons arrived at a detector on the ground in Kagoshima, Japan as cyclones moved past, Tanaka and colleagues produced rough 3-D maps of the density of air inside the storms. The approach gave the team an inside look at the low-pressure regions at the centers rotating storm systems.</p>



<p>Muons, which are similar to electrons but roughly 200 times as massive, can scatter off molecules in the air. They’re also unstable, which means they break down into electrons and other particles called neutrinos given enough time. As air pressure increases, so does its density. That, in turn, increases the chances that a muon born from a cosmic ray will be bumped off its path on the way toward a detector or get slowed enough that it breaks down before it makes it all the way through the atmosphere.</p>



<p>For every 1 percent increase in air pressure, Tanaka and colleagues say, the number of muons that survive passage from the upper atmosphere to the ground decreases by about 2 percent.</p>

The darkened portion was outside the viewing angle of the muon detector.</span><span class="credit wp-credit-3118570">©2022 H.K.M. Tanaka</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>Tanaka has previously used muons from cosmic rays to <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/muon-subatomic-particle-volcano-pyramid-physics">look inside volcanoes</a>, and he suspects that others have used the particles to study weather (<em>SN: 4/22/22</em>). But, he says, this appears to be the first time that anyone has made 3-D muon scans of the insides of a storm.</p>



<p>“It is an interesting approach,” says meteorologist Frank Marks of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s Atlantic Oceanographic and Meteorological Laboratory in Miami, who wasn’t involved in the research.</p>



<p>He doesn&#8217;t expect muon imaging to replace conventional meteorological measurements, but it’s another tool that scientists could use. “[It] would be complementary to our existing techniques to provide 3-D mapping of the storms with our other traditional observing systems, like satellites and radar.”<a href="https://sites.google.com/site/snstaffresources/resources/citation-styles" target="_blank" rel="noopener"></a></p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/social-sciences-definitions-terms-research-measurment">Why fuzzy definitions are a problem in the social sciences</a></h4>

              
                <p>U.S. millennials are rejecting suburbia and moving back to the city. That was a prevailing idea in 2019, when I started as the social sciences reporter at <em>Science News</em>. But when I began digging into a possible story on the phenomenon, I encountered an incoherent mess. Some research showed that suburbs were growing, others that suburbs were shrinking and yet others showed growth in both suburbs and cities.</p>



<p>Unable to make sense of that maze of findings, I shelved the story idea. Then, several months later, I stumbled across a Harvard University white paper explaining that disagreement in the field stems from <a href="https://www.jchs.harvard.edu/research-areas/working-papers/defining-suburbs-how-definitions-shape-suburban-landscape" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">competing definitions</a> of what distinguishes a city from a suburb. Some researchers define the suburbs as areas falling outside census-designated cities. Others look only for markers of suburbanism, such as a wealth of single-family houses and car-based commutes, the researchers wrote.</p>





<p>I have encountered this type of fuzziness around definitions of all sorts of terms and concepts in the years I’ve covered the social sciences. Sometimes researchers simply assume that their definition of a key concept is <em>the </em>definition. Or they nod briefly at other definitions, and then go forth with whichever one they choose, without much explanation why. Other times, researchers in one subfield choose one definition, and researchers in another subfield choose a different one — each without ever knowing of the other’s existence. It’s enough to drive any reporter to tear their hair out.</p>



<p>“If you look … you will find this morass of definitions and measurements” in the social sciences, says quantitative psychologist Jessica Flake of McGill University in Montreal. My experience was a common one, she assured me.</p>



<p>Definitional morasses exist in other scientific fields too. Biologists frequently disagree about how best <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/defining-species-fuzzy-art">to define the word “species”</a> (<em>SN: 11/1/17</em>). Virologists squabble <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/viruses-alive-coronavirus-definition">over what counts as “alive” when it comes to viruses</a> (<em>SN: 11/1/21</em>). And not all astronomers are happy with the decision to define the word “planet” in a way that left <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/pluto-planet-vote-status-definition-demotion">Pluto</a> out in the cold as a mere dwarf planet (<em>SN: 8/24/21</em>). </p>



<p>But the social sciences have some special challenges, Flake says. The field is a youngster compared with a discipline like astronomy, so has had less time to sort out its definitions. And social science concepts are often inherently subjective. Describing abstract ideas like motivation or feelings can be squishier than describing, say, a meteorite.</p>



<p>It’s tempting to assume, as I did until I began researching this column, that a single, imperfect definition for individual concepts is preferable to this definitional cacophony. And some researchers encourage this approach. “While no suburban definition will be perfect, <a href="https://www.jchs.harvard.edu/sites/default/files/media/imp/Harvard_JCHS_Airgood-Obrycki_Rieger_Defining_Suburbs.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">standardization</a> would increase understanding of how suburban studies relate to each other,” the Harvard researchers wrote in that suburbia paper. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>But a recent study taking aim at how we define the middle class showed me how alternative definitions can lead to a shift in perspective.</p>



<p>While most researchers use income as a proxy for class, these researchers used people’s buying patterns. That revealed that a fraction of people who appear middle class by income struggle to pay for basic necessities, such as housing, child care and groceries, the team reported in July in <em>Social Indicators Research</em>. &nbsp;That is, they <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11205-022-02977-8#citeas" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">live as if they are working class</a>.</p>



<p>What’s more, that vulnerable group skews Black and Hispanic, a disparity that arises, in part, because these families of color often lack the generational wealth of white families, says Melissa Haller, a geographer at Binghamton University in New York. So when calamity strikes, families without that financial cushion can struggle to recover. Yet a government or nonprofit organization looking to direct aid toward the neediest families, and relying solely on income-based metrics, would overlook this vulnerable group.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Depending on what definition you start with, you will see different facts,” says Anna Alexandrova, a philosopher of science at the University of Cambridge. A standardized definition of middle class, for example, could obscure some of those key facts.</p>



<p>In the social sciences, what’s needed instead of conceptual unity, Alexandrova says, is conceptual clarity.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Though social scientists disagree about how to go about solving this problem of clarity, Flake says that failure to tackle the issue jeopardizes the field as much as <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/blog/science-the-public/replication-crisis-psychology-science-studies-statistics" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">other crises</a> rocking the discipline (<em>SN: 8/27/18</em>). That’s because how a topic is defined determines the scales, surveys and other instruments used to study that concept. And that in turn shapes how researchers crunch numbers and arrive at conclusions. &nbsp;</p>



<p>Defining one’s key terms and then selecting the right tool is somewhat straightforward when relying on large, external datasets. For instance, instead of using national income databases, as is common in the study of the middle class, Haller and her team turned to the federal government’s Consumer Expenditure Surveys to understand people’s daily and emergency purchases.</p>



<p>But often social scientists, particularly psychologists, develop their own scales and surveys to quantify subjective concepts, such as self-esteem, mood or well-being. Definitions of those terms — and the instruments used to study them — can take on a life of their own, Flake says.</p>



<p>She and her team recently showed how this process plays out in the May-June <em>American Psychologist</em>. They combed through the 100 original studies and 100 replications included in a massive reproducibility project in psychology. The researchers zoomed in on 97 multi-item scales — measuring concepts such as gratitude, motivation and self-esteem — used in the original studies, and found that 54 of those scales had no citations to show where the scales originated. That suggests that the original authors defined their idea, and the tool used to measure that idea, <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35482669/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">on the fly</a>, Flake says. Research teams then attempted to replicate 29 of those studies without digging into the scales’ sources, calling into question the meaning of their results.</p>



<p>For Flake, the way to achieve conceptual clarity is straightforward, if unlikely. Researchers must hit the brakes on generating new ideas, or replicating old ideas, and instead interrogate the morass of old ones.</p>



<p>She points to one promising, if labor-intensive, effort: the <a href="https://psysciacc.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Psychological Science Accelerator</a>, a collaboration of over 1,300 researchers in 84 countries. The project aims to identify big ideas in psychology, such as face perception and gender prejudice, and accumulate all the instruments and resulting data used to make sense of those ideas in order to discard, refine or combine existing definitions and tools.</p>



<p>“Instead of running replications, why don’t we use [this] massive team of researchers who represent a lot of perspectives around the world and review concepts first,” Flake says. “We need to stop replicating garbage.”</p>



<p>I couldn’t agree more.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/delaware-sized-iceberg-antarctica-larsen">Here’s what happened to the Delaware-sized iceberg that broke off Antarctica</a></h4>

              
                <p>It was the rift watched ‘round the world.</p>



<p>In July 2017, after weeks of anticipation, a massive iceberg about the size of Delaware <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/delaware-sized-iceberg-breaks-antarctic-ice-shelf">split from the Antarctic Peninsula</a> (<em>SN: 7/12/17</em>). Satellite images show that the orphaned iceberg, known as A68, ultimately disintegrated in the Southern Ocean. Now, researchers say they have pieced together the powerful forces that led to that final breakup.</p>



<p>Polar scientist Alex Huth of Princeton University and colleagues combined observations of the iceberg’s drift with simulations of ocean currents and wind stress. Iceberg A68a, the largest remaining chunk of the original berg, was caught in a tug-of-war of ocean currents, and the <a href="http://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.abq6974" target="_blank" rel="noopener">strain of those opposing forces probably pulled the iceberg apart</a>, the team reports October 19 in <em>Science Advances</em>.</p>





<p>After A68’s separation from the Larsen C ice shelf, researchers had questions — such as what creatures <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/antarctic-expedition-search-life-larsen-c-ice-shelf-iceberg">live on the seafloor in the ice’s dark shadow</a> (<em>SN: 2/8/19</em>). As for the iceberg itself, it <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/giant-iceberg-broke-antarctica-larsen-c-ice-shelf-stuck">took a while to get moving</a>, lingering in the neighborhood for about a year (<em>SN: 7/23/18</em>). By December 2020, satellite images show, the berg had clearly seen some action and was just two-thirds of its original size.</p>

<p>The new simulations suggest how A68a probably met its fate. On December 20, 2020, the long, slender “finger” at one end of the iceberg drifted into a strong, fast-moving current. The rest of the ice remained outside the current. The tension rifted the berg, and the finger sheared off and broke apart within a few days.</p>



<p>Shear stress is a previously unknown mechanism for large iceberg breakup, and isn’t represented in climate simulations, the team says. In the Southern Ocean, the melting of massive bergs can be a large source of cold freshwater to the ocean surface. That, in turn, can have a big impact on ocean circulation and the global climate.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/yellowstone-landslides-hidden-landscape-lasers">Landslides shaped a hidden landscape within Yellowstone</a></h4>

              
                <p><strong>DENVER</strong> — A hidden landscape riddled with landslides is coming into focus in Yellowstone National Park, thanks to a laser-equipped airplane.</p>



<p>Scientists of yore crisscrossed Yellowstone on foot and studied aerial photographs to better understand America’s first national park. But today researchers have a massive new digital dataset at their fingertips that’s shedding new light on this nearly 1-million-hectare natural wonderland.</p>



<p>These observations of Yellowstone have allowed a pair of researchers to <a href="https://gsa.confex.com/gsa/2022AM/meetingapp.cgi/Paper/378704" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">pinpoint over 1,000 landslides within and near the park</a>, hundreds of which had not been mapped before, the duo reported October 9 at the Geological Society of America Connects 2022 meeting. Most of these landslides likely occurred thousands of years ago, but some are still moving.</p>





<p>Mapping Yellowstone’s landslides is important because they can cripple infrastructure like roadways and bridges. The millions of visitors that explore the park each year access Yellowstone through just a handful of entrance roads, one of which recently <a href="https://www.nps.gov/yell/planyourvisit/flood-recovery.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">closed for months following intense flooding.</a></p>



<p>In 2020, a small aircraft flew a few hundred meters above the otherworldly landscape of Yellowstone. But it wasn’t ferrying tourists eager for up close views of the park’s <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/yellowstone-wolves-reintroduction-genes-ancestry" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">famous wolves</a> or <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/yellowstone-steamboat-geyser-reawakened-no-eruption" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">hydrothermal vents</a> (<em>SN: 7/21/20, SN: 1/11/21</em>). Instead, the plane carried a downward-pointing laser that fired pulses of infrared light at the ground. By measuring the timing of pulses that hit the ground and reflected back toward the aircraft, researchers reconstructed the precise topography of the landscape.</p>



<p>Such “light detection and ranging,” or lidar, data reveal details that often remain hidden to the eye. “We’re able to see the surface of the ground as if there’s no vegetation,” says Kyra Bornong, a geoscientist at Idaho State University in Pocatello. Similar lidar observations have been used to pinpoint <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/amazon-lasers-lidar-ancient-urban-system-casarabe-bolivia" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">pre-Columbian settlements deep within the Amazon jungle</a> (<em>SN: 5/25/22</em>).</p>



<p>The Yellowstone lidar data were collected as part of the <a href="https://www.usgs.gov/3d-elevation-program" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">3D Elevation Program</a>, an ongoing project spearheaded by the United States Geological Survey to map the entirety of the United States using lidar.</p>



<div class="wp-block-sciencenews-content-sidebar">
<h3>Slip and slide</h3>



<p>Laser-mapping of the Yellowstone area uncovered over 1,000 landslides (outlined in yellow), most within the national park. This topographical map (red denotes higher elevations; blue is lower) reveals that many of the landslides are concentrated around the edges of the park. While most are ancient, some are still active.</p>

Bornong and B. Crosby/Idaho State Univ., USGS</span></figcaption></figure>
</div>



<p>Bornong and geomorphologist Ben Crosby analyzed the Yellowstone data — which resolve details as small as about one meter — to home in on landslides. The team searched for places where the landscape changed from looking relatively smooth to looking jumbled, evidence that soil and rocks had once been on the move. “It’s a pattern-recognition game,” says Crosby, also of Idaho State University. “You’re looking for this contrast between the lumpy stuff and the smooth stuff.”</p>



<p>The researchers spotted more than 1,000 landslides across Yellowstone, most of which were clustered near the periphery of the park. That makes sense given the geography of Yellowstone’s interior, says Lyman Persico, a geomorphologist at Whitman College in Walla Walla, Wash., who was not involved in the research. The park <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/sinking-melting-ancient-tectonic-plate-may-fuel-yellowstones-supervolcano" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">sits atop a supervolcano</a>, whose previous eruptions blanketed much of the park in lava (<em>SN: 1/2/18</em>). “You’re sitting in the middle of the Yellowstone caldera, where everything is flat,” says Persico.</p>



<p>But steep terrain also abounds in the national park, and there’s infrastructure in many of those landslide-prone areas. In several places, the team found that roads had been built over landslide debris. One example is Highway 191, which skirts the western edge of Yellowstone. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-jetpack-image-compare"><div class="juxtapose" data-mode="horizontal"><img loading="lazy" id="3118533" src="https://i2.wp.com/www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/101922_kk_yellowstone_slider-1.jpg?ssl=1" alt="" width="680" height="445" class="image-compare__image-before" /><img loading="lazy" id="3118534" src="https://i0.wp.com/www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/101922_kk_yellowstone_slider-2.jpg?ssl=1" alt="" width="680" height="445" class="image-compare__image-after" /></div><figcaption>An aerial image of U.S. Highway 191 near Yellowstone shows barely perceptible signs of a long-ago landslide. But laser mapping reveals the structure and extent of the landslide in much greater detail (use the slider to compare images). It’s one of more than 1,000 landslides uncovered by new maps.</figcaption></figure>



<p>It’s worth keeping an eye on this highway since it funnels significant amounts of traffic through regions apt to experience landslides, Bornong says. “It’s one of the busiest roads in Montana.”</p>



<p>There’s plenty more to learn from this novel look at Yellowstone, Crosby says. Lidar data can shed light on geologic processes like volcanic and tectonic activity, both of which Yellowstone has in spades. “It’s a transformative tool,” he says.</p>

<p><a href="https://bookshop.org/a/21798/9781982117351" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Song of the Cell</a><br><em>Siddhartha Mukherjee<br>Scribner, $32.50</em></p>



<p>In the summer of 1960, doctors extracted “crimson sludge” from 6-year-old Barbara Lowry’s bones and gave it to her twin.</p>



<p>That surgery, one of the first successful bone marrow transplants, belied the difficulty of the procedure. In the early years of transplantation, scores of patients died as doctors struggled to figure out how to use one person’s cells to treat another. “Cell therapy for blood diseases had a terrifying birth,” Siddhartha Mukherjee writes in his new book, <em>The Song of the Cell</em>.</p>





<p>The transplant story is one of many Mukherjee uses to put human faces and experiences at the heart of medical progress. But what radiates off the pages is the author himself. An oncologist, researcher and Pulitzer Prize–winning author, Mukherjee’s curiosity and wisdom add pep to what, in less dexterous hands, might be dry material. He finds wonder in every facet of cell biology, inspiration in the people working in this field and “spine-tingling awe” in their discoveries.</p>





<p>It’s no surprise that Mukherjee is so seduced by science. This is a man who built a microscope from scratch during the pandemic and has spent years probing biology and its history with luminaries in the field. <em>The Song of the Cell </em>lets readers eavesdrop on these conversations, which can be intimate and enlightening.</p>



<p>On a car ride across the Netherlands, Mukherjee chats with geneticist <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/biology-two-new-books-why-hard-define-life-meaning">Paul Nurse</a>, who tells him about the cell division work that ultimately netted Nurse a Nobel Prize (<em>SN: 3/27/21, p. 28</em>). On a walk at Rockefeller University in New York</p>



<p>City, Mukherjee discusses his depression with another Nobel Prize–winning researcher, neuroscientist Paul Greengard. Mukherjee’s vivid imagery lends heft to his feelings. He tells Greengard about experiencing a “soupy fog of grief” after his father’s death and describes “drowning in a tide of sadness.”</p>



<p>In these memories, which Mukherjee uses to segue into the science of depression, and elsewhere in the book, hints of poetry shimmer among the prose. A cell observed under a microscope is “refulgent, glimmering, alive.” A white blood cell’s slow creep is like the “ectoplasmic movement of an alien.” Mukherjee weaves his experiences into the story of cell biology, guiding readers through the lives and discoveries of key figures in the field. We meet the “father of microbiology,” Antonie van Leeuwenhoek, a 17th century cloth merchant who ground globules of Venetian glass into microscope lenses and spied a “marvelous cosmos of a living world” within a raindrop. Mukherjee also teleports us to the present to introduce He Jiankui, the disgraced biophysicist behind <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/gene-edited-babies-top-science-stories-2018-yir">the world’s first gene-edited babies</a> (<em>SN: 12/22/18 &amp; 1/5/19, p. 20</em>). Along the way, we also meet Frances Kelsey, the Food and Drug Administration medical officer who refused to approve thalidomide, a drug now known to cause birth defects, for use in the United States, and Lynn Margulis, the evolutionary biologist who argued that <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/tree-life-gets-makeover">mitochondria and other organelles were once free-living bacteria</a> (<em>SN: 8/8/15, p. 22</em>).</p>



<p>Mukherjee traverses a vast landscape of cell biology, and he’s not afraid to pull over and go exploring in the weeds. He describes in detail the flux of ions in nerve cells and introduces a considerable cast of immune system characters. For an even deeper dive, readers can check the footnotes; they are abundant.</p>



<p>What stands out most, though, are Mukherjee’s stories about people: scientists, doctors, patients and himself. As a researcher and a physician, he steps deftly between the scientific and clinical worlds, and, like the microscope he assembled, offers a glimpse into a universe we might not otherwise see.</p>

<p>Open Access (OA) makes research accessible immediately upon publication with no restrictions. Anyone with internet access can find, read, mine, cite and share OA articles at no cost to them. Choosing to publish under an <a href="https://plos.org/open-science/open-access/">OA license</a> advances information equity by making your research more visible, useful, and more transparent. <a href="https://plos.org/open-science/">Open Science</a> expands these benefits to content beyond formal research articles, such as data, methods, code, and earlier versions of the manuscript.</p>



<p>For climate research, the immediacy, reach, and demonstrable rigor that Open Science offers is particularly vital.</p>



<h3>In climate research, every moment counts and all research matters</h3>



<p>The climate is in crisis. The timely and thorough exchange of knowledge can help to meet that challenge by accelerating advancement, supporting high-quality work, and directing scarce research funds where they are needed most. <a href="https://plos.org/open-science/preregistration/">Preregistering</a> a study stakes a claim on a particular investigative pathway, while peer review at the study design phase refines methods for the most rigorous research possible. Posting <a href="https://plos.org/open-science/preprints/">preprints</a> communicates results sooner and opens studies for broader, more inclusive peer review. Publishing <a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2022/09/research-revealed/">negative, null, and confirmatory research</a> limits unnecessary duplication, while reinforcing the validity of previous results.</p>



<h3>Climate researchers care deeply about impact</h3>



<p>In order to create change, climate researchers must reach not only colleagues in their own fields, but researchers in other disciplines and regions, educators, policymakers, practitioners, and the public. Open Science maximizes the impact of research through immediate, broad discoverability, access, sharing, and reuse.&nbsp;</p>



<h3>Climate researchers look for ways to practice transparency and demonstrate credibility</h3>



<p>Although the scientific community reached a consensus on the reality of the climate change crisis more than 20 years ago, researchers in these fields continue to face doubt and criticism fueled by unscrupulous politicking. Open Science empowers researchers to facilitate reproducibility and demonstrate the rigor and validity of their own research, by sharing <a href="https://plos.org/open-science/open-data/">data</a>, <a href="https://plos.org/open-science/open-methods/">methods</a>, <a href="https://plos.org/open-science/open-code/">code</a>, and other artifacts from the research process. By choosing to publish <a href="https://plos.org/published-peer-review-history/">Peer Review History</a>, authors can illustrate the thoroughness of editorial assessment their work has undergone prior to publication.</p>



<h2>Climate Science at PLOS</h2>



<p>We&rsquo;ve long recognized the importance of openness to the climate crisis. It&rsquo;s why, in 2021, we opened three new community-driven journals focused on cross disciplinary research touching on the health of our planet: <a href="https://journals.plos.org/sustainabilitytransformation/"><em>PLOS Sustainability and Transformation</em></a>, <a href="https://journals.plos.org/water/"><em>PLOS Water</em></a>, and <a href="https://journals.plos.org/climate/"><em>PLOS Climate</em></a>.

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/long-covid-risk-nih-recover-symptoms">What is long COVID and who’s at risk? This NIH project may find out</a></h4>

              
                <p>You may have heard the big long COVID news that came out recently: A Scottish study reported that about <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-022-33415-5" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">half of people infected with SARS-CoV-2</a> have not fully recovered six to 18 months after infection. That result echoes what many doctors and patients have been saying for months. Long COVID is a serious problem and a huge number of people are dealing with it. </p>



<p>But it’s tough to find treatments for a disease that is <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/long-covid-definition-symptoms-treatment-coronavirus" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">still so ill-defined</a> (<em>SN: 7/29/22</em>). One major research effort in the United States hopes to change that. And one of my colleagues, <em>Science News</em>’ News Director <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/author/macon-morehouse">Macon Morehouse</a>, got a peek into the process.</p>





<p>In the last two months, Morehouse has donated 15 vials of blood, two urine specimens and a sample of saliva. Technicians have measured her blood pressure, oxygen level, height, weight and waist circumference and counted how many times she could rise from sitting to standing in 30 seconds. Morehouse is not sick, nor is she collecting data for her health. She’s doing it for science.</p>



<p>Morehouse is participating in a long COVID study at Howard University in Washington D.C. It’s part of a many-armed giant of a project with an eye on one thing: the long-term health effects of COVID-19. Launched last year by the National Institutes of Health, the <a href="https://recovercovid.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">RECOVER Initiative</a> aims to enroll roughly 60,000 adults and children. At the Howard site, Morehouse is volunteer No. 182.</p>



<p>She’s somewhat of a unicorn among study participants: As far as she knows, Morehouse has never had COVID-19. Ultimately, some 10 percent of participants will include people who have avoided the virus, says Stuart Katz, a cardiologist and a RECOVER study leader at NYU Langone Health in New York City. Scientists continue to sign up volunteers, but “omicron made it harder to find uninfected people,” he says.</p>



<p>RECOVER scientists need participants like Morehouse so the researchers can compare them with people who developed long COVID. That might reveal what the disease is — and who it tends to strike. “Our goals are to define long COVID and to understand what’s your risk of getting [it] after COVID infection,” Katz says. Their results could be a first step toward developing treatments.</p>



<h4>Tight timeline</h4>



<p>Within the pandemic’s first year, doctors noticed that some COVID-19 patients developed long-term symptoms such as brain fog, fatigue and chronic cough. In December 2020, Katz and other physicians and scientists convened to discuss what was known. The answer, it turned out, was not much. “This is a novel virus,” he says. “Nobody knew what it could do.” Around the same time, Congress OK’d $1.15 billion for the NIH to study COVID-19’s long-term health consequences.</p>



<p>Fast forward five months, and the agency had awarded nearly $470 million to NYU Langone Health to serve as the hub for its long COVID studies. “The whole thing was on a very, very compressed timeline,” Katz says. NYU then hustled to come up with a study plan focused on three main groups: adults, children/families and finally, tissue samples from people who died after having COVID-19. It wasn’t your typical research project, Katz says. “We were charged with studying a disease that didn&#8217;t have a definition.”</p>



<p>Today, RECOVER has enrolled just over half of a target 17,680 adults. Katz hopes to cross this finish line by spring 2023. The child-focused part of the project has further to go. The goal is to enroll nearly 20,000 children; so far, they’ve got around 1,200, says Diana Bianchi, director of the Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development and a member of RECOVER’s executive committee.</p>

<p>Some scientists and patients <a href="https://www.statnews.com/2022/03/29/nih-long-covid-sluggish-study/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">have criticized RECOVER</a> for moving <a href="https://www.science.org/content/article/long-covid-national-crisis-so-why-are-grants-taking-so-long-get" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">too slowly</a>. As someone who has recovered from long COVID himself, Katz says he gets it. “We started a year and a half ago, and we don’t yet have definitive answers,” he says. “For people that have been suffering, I can understand how it’s disappointing.”</p>



<p>But for RECOVER — with more than 400 doctors, scientists and other experts involved, roughly 180 sites across the country enrolling participants and a grant timeline that scuttled the usual order of events — the old saying about building the plane while flying it fits, Katz says. “We are working very, very hard to move as quickly as we can.”</p>



<h4>Looking for answers</h4>



<p>Recently, other facets of the initiative have started to shine. An analysis of electronic health records found that among people under 21, kids younger than 5, kids with certain medical conditions and those who had had severe COVID-19 infections may be <a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamapediatrics/fullarticle/2795569" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">most at risk for long COVID</a>, scientists reported in <em>JAMA Pediatrics</em> in August. And a different health records study suggests that <a href="https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.10.06.22280795v1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">vaccinated adults have some protection against long COVID</a>, even if they had a breakthrough infection. Scientists posted that finding this month at medRxiv.org in a study that has yet to be peer-reviewed.</p>



<p>These studies tap data that have already been collected. The bulk of the RECOVER studies will take longer, because scientists will follow patients for years, analyzing data along the way. “These are observational, longitudinal studies,” Katz says. “There’s no intervention; we’re basically just trying to understand what long COVID is.”</p>



<p>Still, Katz expects to see early results later this fall. By then, scientists should have an official, if rough, definition of long COVID, which could help doctors struggling to diagnose the disease. By the end of the year, Katz says RECOVER might also have answers about viral persistence — whether coronavirus relics left behind in the body somehow reboot symptoms.</p>



<p>The project has also recently sprouted a clinical trials arm, which may launch this winter, says Kanecia Zimmerman, a pediatric critical care specialist who is leading this effort at the Duke Clinical Research Institute in North Carolina. One of the first trials planned will test whether an antiviral therapy that clears SARS-CoV-2 from the body helps patients with persistent symptoms.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Though RECOVER is a major effort to understand long COVID, progress will require research — and ideas — from a broad group of scientists, says Diane Griffin, a microbiologist at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health in Baltimore and member of the <a href="https://lc19.org/team/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Long COVID Research Initiative</a>, who is not involved in the project. “Just because we’ve invested in this one big study, that’s not going to give us all the answers,” she says.</p>



<p>But information from study participants like Morehouse and the nearly 10,000 other adults who’ve already enrolled in RECOVER will help. In the meantime, continued support for long COVID research is crucial, Griffin says. “That’s the only way we’re going to eventually figure this out.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/proton-stretch-particle-physics-quarks">Protons may be stretchier than physics predicts</a></h4>

              
                <p>Protons might be stretchier than they should be.</p>



<p>The subatomic particles are built of smaller particles called quarks, which are bound together by a powerful interaction known as the strong force. New experiments seem to show that the quarks <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-022-05248-1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">respond more than expected to an electric field pulling on them</a>, physicist Nikolaos Sparveris and colleagues report October 19 in <em>Nature</em>. The result suggests that the strong force isn’t quite as strong as theory predicts.</p>



<p>It’s a finding at odds with the standard model of particle physics, which describes the particles and forces that combine to make up us and everything around us. The result has some physicists stumped about how to explain it — or whether to even try.</p>





<p>“It is certainly puzzling for the physics of the strong interaction, if this thing persists,” says Sparveris, of Temple University in Philadelphia.</p>



<p>Such stretchiness has turned up in other labs’ experiments, but wasn’t as convincing, Sparveris says. The stretchiness that he and his colleagues measured was less extreme than in previous experiments, but also came with less experimental uncertainty. That increases the researchers’ confidence that protons are indeed stretchier than theory says they should be.</p>



<p>At the Thomas Jefferson National Accelerator Facility in Newport News, Va., the team probed protons by firing electrons at a target of ultracold liquid hydrogen. Electrons scattering off protons in the hydrogen revealed how <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/50-years-ago-particle-physics-proton-gluon-quarks-force" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the protons’ quarks</a> respond to electric fields (<em>SN: 9/13/22</em>). The higher the electron energy, the deeper the researchers could see into the protons, and the more the electrons revealed about how the strong force works inside protons.</p>



<p>For the most part, the quarks moved as expected when electric interactions pulled the particles in opposite directions. But at one point, as the electron energy was ramped up, the quarks appeared to respond more strongly to an electric field than theory predicted they would. &nbsp;</p>



<p>But it only happened for a small range of electron energies, leading to a bump in a plot of the proton’s stretch.</p>



<p>“Usually, behaviors of these things are quite, let’s say, smooth and there are no bumps,” says physicist Vladimir Pascalutsa of the Johannes Gutenberg University Mainz in Germany.</p>



<p>Pascalutsa says he’s often eager to dive into puzzling problems, but the odd stretchiness of protons is too sketchy for him to put pencil to paper at this time. “You need to be very, very inventive to come up with a whole framework which somehow finds you a new effect” to explain the bump, he says. “I don’t want to kill the buzz, but yeah, I’m quite skeptical as a theorist that this thing is going to stay.”</p>



<p>It will take more experiments to get theorists like him excited about unusually stretchy protons, Pascalutsa says. He could get his wish if Sparveris’ hopes are fulfilled to try the experiment again with positrons, the antimatter version of electrons, scattered from protons instead.</p>



<p>A different type of experiment altogether might make stretchy protons more compelling, Pascalutsa says. A forthcoming study from the Paul Scherrer Institute in Villigen, Switzerland, could do the trick. It will use hydrogen atoms that have muons in place of the electrons that usually orbit atoms’ nuclei. Muons are about 200 times as heavy as electrons, and orbit much closer to the nucleus of an atom than do electrons — offering <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/proton-size-still-perplexes-despite-new-measurement">a closer look at the proton inside</a> (<em>SN: 10/5/17</em>). The experiment would involve stimulating the “muonic hydrogen” with lasers rather than scattering other electrons or positrons from them.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“The precision in the muonic hydrogen experiments will be much higher than whatever can be achieved in scattering experiments,” Pascalutsa says. If the stretchiness turns up there as well, “then I would start to look at this right away.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/stars-time-planet-formation-gas-disk">Most stars may have much more time to form planets than previously thought</a></h4>

              
                <p>Good news for late bloomers: Planets may have millions of years more time to arise around most stars than previously thought.</p>



<p>Planet-making disks around young stars <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.02420" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">typically last for 5 million to 10 million years</a>, researchers report in a study posted October 6 at arXiv.org. That disk lifetime, based on a survey of nearby young star clusters, is a good deal longer than the previous estimate of 1 million to 3 million years.</p>



<p>“One to three megayears is a really strong constraint for forming planets,” says astrophysicist Susanne Pfalzner of Forschungszentrum Jülich in Germany. “Finding that we have a lot of time just relaxes everything” for building planets around young stars.</p>





<p>Planets large and small develop in the <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/baby-planet-forming-stunning-images-swirling-gas-dust" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">disks of gas and dust that swirl around young stars</a> (<em>SN: 5/20/20</em>). Once a disk vanishes, it’s too late to make any more new worlds.</p>



<p>Past studies have estimated disk lifetimes by looking at the fraction of young stars of different ages that still have disks — in particular, by observing star clusters with known ages. But Pfalzner and her colleagues discovered something odd: The farther a star cluster is from Earth, the shorter the estimated disk lifetime. That made no sense, she says, because why should the lifetime of a protoplanetary disk depend on how far it is from us?</p>



<p>The answer is quite simple: It doesn’t. But in clusters that are farther away, it’s harder to see most stars. “When you look at larger distances, you see higher-mass stars,” Pfalzner says, because those stars are brighter and easier to see. “You basically don’t see the low-mass stars.” But the lowest-mass stars constitute the vast majority. These stars, orange and red dwarfs, are cooler, smaller and fainter than the sun.</p>



<p>So Pfalzner and her colleagues examined only the nearest young star clusters, those within 650 light-years of Earth, and found that the fraction of stars with planet-making disks was much higher than that reported in previous studies. This analysis showed that “the low-mass stars have much longer disk lifetimes, between 5 and 10 megayears,” than astronomers realized, she says. In contrast, disks around higher-mass stars are known to disperse faster than this, perhaps because their suns’ brighter light pushes the gas and dust away more quickly.</p>



<p>“I wouldn’t say that this is definite proof” for such long disk lifetimes around orange and red dwarfs, says Álvaro Ribas, an astronomer at the University of Cambridge who was not involved with the work. “But it’s quite convincing.&#8221;</p>



<p>To bolster the result, he’d like to see observations of more distant star clusters — perhaps with the <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/james-webb-space-telescope-stars-earliest-born-sparkler-galaxy" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">James Webb Space Telescope</a> — to determine the fraction of the faintest stars that have preserved their planet-making disks between 5 million and 20 million years (<em>SN: 10/11/22</em>).</p>



<p>If the disks around the lowest mass stars do indeed have long lifetimes, that may explain a difference between our solar system and those of most red dwarfs, Pfalzner says. The latter often lack gas giants like Jupiter and Saturn, which are about 10 times the diameter of Earth. Instead, those stars frequently have numerous ice giants like Uranus and Neptune, about four times the diameter of Earth. Perhaps Neptune-sized planets arise in larger numbers when a planet-making disk lasts longer, Pfalzner says, accounting for why these worlds tend to abound around smaller stars.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/colonoscopy-screening-effectiveness-study-limitations">A study questioning colonoscopy screening’s benefits has big caveats</a></h4>

              
                <p>A recent study reported a smaller-than-expected benefit from screening colonoscopies. But the study has important caveats, gastroenterologists say, making it ripe for misinterpretation if that context isn’t included.</p>



<p>The study was the first randomized controlled trial — widely considered the gold standard for testing medical interventions — of the procedure. Published online October 9 in the <em>New England Journal of Medicine</em>, the study <a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2208375" target="_blank" rel="noopener">followed participants invited to have a colonoscopy and compared how they fared with participants who weren’t invited to undergo the procedure</a>. The risk of colorectal cancer at 10 years was reduced by 18 percent in the invited group. But there wasn’t a meaningful difference in the risk of death from colorectal cancer between the two groups, the study reported.</p>





<p>This was disappointing, gastroenterologists say, as past research has shown screening colonoscopies to be more effective in reducing the risks of developing and dying from colorectal cancer. Those previous data were from observational studies, which don’t randomly assign patients to get, or not get, a treatment.</p>



<p>But a closer look at the details of the new study reveals why it shouldn’t be interpreted as a slam-dunk against the screening test. First, fewer than half of the people invited to have a colonoscopy actually did. The study also didn’t follow patients long enough to fully assess the risk of death from colorectal cancer. And some of the physicians who did the procedure didn’t meet a minimum quality benchmark.</p>



<p>These issues limit what this study can tell us about screening colonoscopies. On top of that, this study should not be used to cast doubt on colorectal cancer screening in general, says Folasade May, a gastroenterologist and health services researcher at UCLA Health. “Screening is effective, and it saves lives,” she says. “We have enough data to promote screening.”</p>



<h4>Screening importance</h4>



<p>Colorectal cancer is the <a href="https://www.cancer.org/cancer/colon-rectal-cancer/about/key-statistics.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">second-leading cause of cancer deaths for men and women combined</a>, according to the American Cancer Society. It’s expected to kill more than 52,000 Americans in 2022. There are racial disparities in who gets and dies from the disease. Rates of incidence and death are <a href="https://acsjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.3322/caac.21718" target="_blank" rel="noopener">21 percent and 44 percent higher</a> in Black men compared with white men; the rates for Black women compared with white women are 18 percent and 31 percent higher, respectively. &nbsp;</p>



<p>The <a href="https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/uspstf/recommendation/colorectal-cancer-screening" target="_blank" rel="noopener">U.S. Preventive Services Task Force recommends screening for colorectal cancer</a> in adults <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/experts-advise-start-colorectal-screening-45-not-50">ages 45 to 75 years old</a> (<em>SN:</em> <em>5/31/18</em>). There are different screening options, including stool-based tests; colonoscopy, which examines the whole colon; and sigmoidoscopy, which looks at a portion of the colon. Average-risk individuals — those who don’t have a family history of colorectal cancer or other conditions that increase risk — can choose the option that works for them. “We just want people to get screened,” says gastroenterologist Sophie Balzora of the New York University Grossman School of Medicine. “The best test is the one that gets done.”</p>



<p>The fecal immunochemical test, or FIT, and colonoscopy are commonly performed in the United States. The FIT detects tiny amounts of blood in the stool, which can be a sign of colorectal cancer, and is done at home.</p>



<p>During a colonoscopy, a physician looks for and removes polyps, growths of tissue that can become cancerous. But the procedure’s expense, time and preparation can be prohibitive for some patients, says Carol Burke, a gastroenterologist at the Cleveland Clinic. People may not have the flexibility to take time off work for the procedure or have someone who is available to drive them home, for example. To complete a colonoscopy, “you have to be sure that you can address the patient’s barriers,” Burke says.</p>



<h4>Important caveats</h4>



<p>The potential barriers to getting a colonoscopy mean it’s not enough to just tell someone to do it. That’s also the case in Poland, Norway and Sweden, where colonoscopies are not commonly used to screen for colorectal cancer. One-third of roughly 84,000 study participants from these countries were invited to get colonoscopies. The other two-thirds made up the “usual care” group. But “the intervention was an invitation, not a colonoscopy,” Balzora says. Only 42 percent of the participants invited to get the procedure had one. The majority of the invitees turned the invitation down.</p>



<p>“If you don’t actually have the test, it can’t possibly protect you,” says gastroenterologist Aasma Shaukat of the New York University Grossman School of Medicine.</p>



<p>Another limitation of the new study has to do with time. Colon cancer develops slowly. Most polyps don’t become cancerous, but for those that do, it can take 10 years or more. Then it takes time for the cancer to spread and become fatal. At least 15 years of follow up are needed to really look at the impact on colorectal cancer deaths, Shaukat says, so the study’s report at 10 years isn’t long enough.</p>



<p>And the quality of the colonoscopies performed in the study varied. One standard is the adenoma detection rate, the number of colonoscopies that turn up a precancerous polyp, or adenoma, divided by the number of colonoscopies performed over a period of time. In the new study, nearly 30 percent of the physicians doing the procedures had rates below the recommended minimum quality rate.</p>



<p>In their paper, the study’s authors acknowledge these limitations. They note that the colonoscopy-by-invitation approach may have underestimated the benefits of the procedure. They say that reductions in risk of cancer are expected to appear before reductions in risk of death; the team will report results again at 15 years of follow-up. And, they add, differences in quality benchmarks among practitioners may have affected the detection of cancer.</p>



<p>The new study needs to be considered among other evidence for the effectiveness of screening colonoscopies, Shaukat says. For example, an analysis that combined observational studies of colonoscopy, published in 2014 in the <em>British Medical Journal</em>, reported that the procedure <a href="https://www.bmj.com/content/348/bmj.g2467" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reduces both colorectal cancer incidence and mortality by close to 70 percent</a>.</p>



<p>Another observational study looked at an organized screening program that used colonoscopy, sigmoidoscopy and FIT. The program led to a boost in screening that was linked to a 25 percent decrease in the annual incidence of colorectal cancer from 2000 to 2015 and <a href="https://www.gastrojournal.org/article/S0016-5085(18)34783-8/fulltext" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a 52 percent drop in deaths from the cancer</a>, researchers reported in <em>Gastroenterology</em> in 2018.</p>



<p>There is also a randomized controlled trial going on now in the United States that will compare head-to-head the effectiveness of screening with colonoscopy or FIT in average-risk people. So there’s more data to come. The new study “isn’t the end-all, be-all study,” May says. “We haven’t closed the door on colonoscopy.”</p>

<p>The aim is to foster cross-talk between eco-evolutionary and oncology perspectives to advance our understanding of cancer.</p>
<p><b>Meet the Guest Editor</b></p>
<p>Ignacio González Bravo, <i>CNRS Montpellier</i></p>
<p>Dr Ignacio González Bravo is a biochemist by training with a PhD in molecular microbiology studying the evolution of bacterial polysialic capsules. Ignacio was introduced to cancer research during his postdoc years at the German Cancer Research Center in Heidelberg, working on the emergence and function of viral oncogenes. Ignacio later worked on the interface between cancer epidemiology and viral diversity and evolution, first as the head of the Infections and Cancer Laboratory at the Catalan Institute of Oncology and now as Research Director at the French National Center for Scientific Research in Montpellier. Ignacio uses viral induced-cancers as an experimental model. His main research program advocates for the introduction of evolutionary thinking as a central element in understanding the proximate and ultimate origins of cancer: from molecular mechanisms and functions to adaptation, from the natural history of the infection in the patient to the evolution of cancer susceptibility across species.</p>

                <p>On Thursday, October 20, we held our 13th annual Neuroscience Symposium. &nbsp;The topic was organoid models of cortical development. &nbsp;Brain organoids are 3-dimensional tissues grown from pluripotent stem cells. For studying cortical development, the stem cells are cultured under conditions that promote differentiation into cerebral cortex neurons. &nbsp;The participants in the symposium spoke on the use of organoids as a model to study human cortical development and disorders of development. &nbsp;</p>
<p>After the symposium, the speakers met for a panel discussion, which was recorded.</p>

                A paper with scientific sleuth Elisabeth Bik as a co-author now has an expression of concern.

                A psychology professor has lost a paper for failing to disclose a crucial conflict of interest about one of the subjects of the work, which critiqued various blogs. That’s because one of those blogs was written by none other than the author of the paper, Peter Kinderman, a professor at the University of Liverpool and &#8230; <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2022/10/20/what-happened-when-a-psychology-professor-used-a-peer-reviewed-paper-to-praise-his-own-blog-and-slam-others/" class="more-link">Continue reading <span class="screen-reader-text">What happened when a psychology professor used a peer-reviewed paper to praise his own blog – and slam others’￼</span></a>
