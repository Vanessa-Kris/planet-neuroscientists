<img alt="" class="attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image" height="110" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2018/07/Eciton_burchellii_army_ants-e1531393107574-140x110.jpg" style="display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;" width="140" /><p>Scientists interested in the evolution of brains often use comparisons among species to explore how the nervous system is shaped by, and adapts to, its environment. Brain tissue is very expensive, and so investment in brains (or in particular brain regions) is expected to closely match the mental or psychological challenges a species confronts: there should be just enough brain power and brain tissue to get by, and no more.</p>
<p>We sought to extend this approach to ask whether members of the same species might differ predictably in brain structure and brain investment, in association with differences in behavioral demands.</p>
<h3><strong>Super-organisms</strong></h3>
<p>Animal societies, including human societies, can be complex to navigate. When interacting with an array of social partners and enemies, social smarts can be of great value.</p>
<p>But some animal societies have been shaped by evolution such that internal conflict is minimized; this often happens when the group members are closely related, and when strong competition among groups favors group coordination and performance. Some features of these societies can then evolve in response to natural selection at the level of the group, rather than the individual.</p>
<p>When individual interests align with the group as a whole, we can think of the society as a super-organism. We can then explore how natural selection on groups might drive the evolution of specializations among group members. We expect these specializations to enhance group performance or efficiency. Could group selection actually favor a reduction of brain investment in some group members?</p>
<h3><strong>Comparing castes</strong></h3>
<p>We used the superorganism framework to study patterns of brain investment among the members of insect societies, particularly, of army ants. Social insect colonies are famously divided into castes: classes of individuals that play distinct roles in the social group (for example, think of the reproductive queens versus the sterile, helping workers in a honey bee colony).</p>
<p>Army ants have some of the most dramatic, complex caste systems known: not only are their queens distinctly different, the worker force is divided into three or even four distinct body types, each of which performs different jobs for the colony.</p>
<figure class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_10380" style="width: 610px;"><img alt="" class="size-full wp-image-10380" height="554" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2018/07/army-ant-and-foraging-ant.jpg" width="600" /><div class="attachment-image--caption">A foraging medium-sized worker (gray arrow) and a soldier (white arrow) of the army ant <em>Eciton burchellii cupiens</em>.</div><div class="attachment-image--source"></div></figure>
<p>Among army ant castes, the soldiers in the genus <em>Eciton</em> stand out as being rather behaviorally limited. Soldiers are specialized defenders. They have large, muscle-filled heads that drive long, powerful mouthparts shaped like ice tongs.</p>
<p>They are effective at tracking down, biting, and stinging enemies – mostly birds and mammals, including field biologists. But they do little else. Soldiers cannot carry the young during colony emigrations, or hunt and kill prey. Soldiers cannot even feed themselves.</p>
<p>Do soldiers have reduced brain investment, as expected based on their simple behavioral repertoire? Our data suggest the answer is yes.</p>
<figure class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_10381" style="width: 686px;"><img alt="" class="wp-image-10381 size-full" height="496" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2018/07/Same-scale-3-D-reconstructions-of-head-capsules-e1531392762587.jpg" width="676" /><div class="attachment-image--caption">Same-scale 3-D reconstructions of head capsules and brains of army ant (<em>Eciton burchellii parvispinum</em>) worker (A) and soldier (B). The scale bar represents 0.5 mm. Brain structures are the colored bodies in the center of each head capsule. Dark blue: learning/memory region; Light blue: chemical processing region.</div><div class="attachment-image--source"></div></figure>
<p>We measured head size and brain region volumes in several species of <em>Eciton</em> army ants, comparing workers of different sizes and soldiers in each species. Even though worker brain volume increased with body size, that increase slowed or stopped in the soldiers; even though soldiers were larger than the workers, their brains were similar in size.</p>
<p>Furthermore, two key brain regions were smaller than expected based on soldiers’ overall brain size: a region that processes chemical information, and another region that is critical for learning and memory.</p>
<p>These findings are exciting because they support the idea that natural selection for colony efficiency can favor the evolution of reduced brain investment in some group members, when a caste has limited behavioral demands. It appears<em> Eciton </em>soldiers give new meaning to the term, “meat head.”</p>

<p>Around the world, more people than ever are locked up in prisons – estimated to be in excess of 11 million people, up by almost 20 per cent since the turn of the millennium (<a href="http://www.prisonstudies.org/sites/default/files/resources/downloads/world_prison_population_list_11th_edition_0.pdf">pdf</a>). According to a recent House of Commons <a href="http://www.antoniocasella.eu/nume/Allen_Dempsey_2016.pdf">Briefing Paper</a> the rate of increase is even higher than this in the UK where prison populations are at a record high. Many of these incarcerated individuals have intensifying mental health needs – for instance, the same briefing paper reports that UK rates of self-harm in prisoners were 25 per cent higher in 2015 than in 2014. Ahead of next week’s meeting of the <a href="https://www.bps.org.uk/all-party-parliamentary-group-psychology">All Party Parliamentary Group for Psychology</a> on the topic of Mental Health in the Criminal Justice System, here we provide a digest of research into the mental health of prisoners.</p>
<p><span id="more-34216"></span></p>
<p><strong>Prisoners are at much higher risk of mental health problems than the general population</strong></p>
<p>According to <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22550330">a systematic review</a> published in 2012, involving data from over 30,000 prisoners worldwide from 24 different countries, around 12 per cent of prisoners have a diagnosis of depression and nearly 4 per cent have a diagnosis of psychosis (compared with approximately 4 per cent and 1 per cent, respectively, in the general population). Other mental health conditions are also more common among prison populations than the general public, including substance misuse and personality disorders. The statistics show that <a href="http://www.bbc.com/future/story/20180411-locked-up-and-vulnerable-when-prison-makes-things-worse">women prisoners seem to be at especially high risk of mental health problems</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Prisoners are at elevated risk of suicide</strong></p>
<p>These greater mental health vulnerabilities also manifest in much higher suicide rates among prison populations than among the general public. <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2215036617304303">A study</a> published last year analysed prison suicides across 24 countries between 2011 to 2014. This revealed a threefold increased suicide risk among male prisoners, and a ninefold increased risk of suicide among female prisoners, compared with the general population. The study also measured a number of prison factors to see if these correlated with suicide rates, such as over-crowding and the staff-prisoner ratios, but none of them did. “There are no simple ecological explanations for prison suicide,” the researchers said.</p>
<p><strong>An unresolved issue is whether prison causes mental health problems or people with mental health problems are more likely to go to prison</strong></p>
<p>A recent <a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1016%2FS2215-0366(16)30142-0">review</a> in <em>Lancet Psychiatry</em> described this question as a “key issue” for the field, citing in favour of the “importation” argument two studies that suggested offending rates are higher than average among people with a diagnosis of <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25110636">schizophrenia</a> or <span style="color: #00aadc;"><u>depression</u></span>, which could account for the elevated rates of these diagnoses among prison populations.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, a small British <a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/the-british-journal-of-psychiatry/article/prospective-cohort-study-of-mental-health-during-imprisonment/76CC2340DD5DB3D2723EE81D91276020/core-reader">study</a> published in 2011 found that rates of depression actually decreased, and rates of psychosis remained stable, among the prisoners they followed for two months from the beginning of their sentence. “It appears that the first 2 months of imprisonment do not have a universally detrimental impact on mental health, even among those with pre-existing mental illnesses,” the researchers said (other researchers have previously <a href="https://www.emeraldinsight.com/doi/abs/10.1080/17449200701682436">suggested</a> that the relative safety of prisons, the structure, and access to psychiatric care could be responsible for symptom improvements, and there is even research on <a href="http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0306624X14548531">post-traumatic growth in prison</a> through finding meaning in the experience).</p>
<p>Note, however, that the pattern in the 2011 study was somewhat different for women prisoners, who did not show declines in symptoms. “The notion that women are differently and disproportionately affected by imprisonment is well supported in the literature,” the researchers added. The study also showed that symptom prevalence among prisoners was highest during the first week in prison: “Our findings confirm that the first week of custody continues to represent a period of heightened distress and risk among all newly received prisoners,” the researchers said.</p>
<p><strong>Several pre-incarceration factors have been found to correlate with increased risk of prisoner mental health problems</strong></p>
<p>While the debate continues around whether and what factors of prison increase risk of mental illness, a <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0160252717301255">study</a> published this year that assessed over 750 prisoners from two UK prisons found multiple “imported factors” that were associated with increased risk of having a mental health problem in prison (in this study, around 40 per cent the prisoners had a mental health problem).</p>
<p>These factors included: describing oneself a worrier; being impulsive; having difficulty getting on with others; having been a victim of sexual abuse in childhood (see <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0191886918302137">also</a>); and having learning difficulties at school. “[P]ersonality type may be one area well worth exploring when carrying out initial intake assessments and designing regime or individual sentence plans, as it appears certain dispositions may be useful predictive markers [for risk of mental health issues],” the researchers said.</p>
<p>Counter-intuitively, having a previous prison sentence, past substance abuse problems and being unemployed prior to prison were all associated with lower risk of mental health problems in prison (at a statistically significant level or showing a trend in that direction). “A possible explanation for this finding is that the presence of these factors may make the adoption of a prisonized identity an easier process, which in turn eases mental stress,” the researchers said (for more on the processes of “prisonisation” – i.e. how prison changes people – see <a href="http://www.bbc.com/future/story/20180430-the-unexpected-ways-prison-time-changes-people">here</a>).</p>
<p><strong>Prisoners with mental health problems are more likely to perpetuate and be the victims of violence</strong></p>
<p>A US Department of Justice report (<a href="https://www.bjs.gov/content/pub/pdf/mhppji.pdf">pdf</a>) found that prisoners with mental health problems were more likely to have been charged with physical or verbal assault and more likely to have been injured in a fight, compared with prisoners without mental health issues. Other research has highlighted how prisoners with mental health problems are more likely to be victimised: for instance, <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2811043/">another US study</a> found that 1 in 12 male prisoners with a mental health diagnosis reported sexual victimisation by another inmate, compared with 1 in 33 male prisoners without a mental health diagnosis. Prisoners with mental health problems are <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2836899/">also at increased risk of physical assault by others</a>.</p>
<p><strong>There is a lack of quality research on interventions for prisoners with mental health needs</strong></p>
<p>Given the high rates of mental health problems among prison populations, there is a worrying lack of large-scale intervention studies. The recent <em>Lancet Psychiatry</em> <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5008459/#R17">review</a> of mental health issues in prisons stated that this is likely due to organisational challenges, lack of funding, and “a perceived division of prisoner health from public health in general”. There is some limited evidence for beneficial effects for prisoners of programmes based around CBT, DBT (dialectical behaviour therapy) and Yoga. “But the effect sizes are not large; [it remains unclear] whether they would hold in better quality designs (e.g. using active controls and not waiting list or treatment as usual controls), and it is uncertain whether any improvements are sustained,” the review states. It goes on to recommend that “More evidence is required to determine which psychological therapies are most effective for mental health problems in prison, and whether they can be provided in a group-based formats.” Findings from the community may not generalise to the community, the review authors warn, because of the unique challenges in prison of “the increased structures, different rules, housing, and access to drugs”.</p>
<p>Regarding the prison drug problem, a recent <a href="https://www.justiceinspectorates.gov.uk/hmiprisons/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2015/07/HMIP-AR_2014-15_TSO_Final1.pdf">report</a> by the HM Chief Inspector of Prisons for England and Wales warned about the “rapid increase in the availability of new psychoactive substances (new drugs such as ‘Spice’ and ‘Black Mamba’ that are developed or chosen to mimic the effects of illegal drugs such as cannabis, heroin or amphetamines and may have unpredictable and life-threatening effects)…” and it stated that these drugs have been linked with “problems such as bullying, debt and medical emergencies requiring hospitalisation”.</p>

<p>Forthcoming in Glanzel, W., Moed, H.F., Schmoch U., Thelwall, M. (2018). Springer Handbook of Science and Technology Indicators. Springer.</p>

<blockquote>
<p> </p>

<p>This chapter focuses on the analysis of current publication trends in gold Open Access (OA). The purpose of the chapter is to develop a full understanding on country patterns, OA journals characteristics and citation differences between gold OA and non-gold OA publications. For this, we will first review current literature regarding Open Access and its relation with its so-called citation advantage. Starting with a chronological perspective we will describe its development, how different countries are promoting OA publishing, and its effects on the journal publishing industry. We will deepen the analysis by investigating the research output produced by different units of analysis. First, we will focus on the production of countries with a special emphasis on citation and disciplinary differences. A point of interest will be identification of national idiosyncrasies and the relation between OA publication and research of local interest. This will lead to our second unit of analysis, OA journals indexed in Web of Science. Here we will deepen on journals characteristics and publisher types to clearly identify factors which may affect citation differences between OA and traditional journals which may not necessarily be derived from the OA factor. Gold OA publishing is being encouraged in many countries as opposed to Green OA. This chapter aims at fully understanding how it affects researchers’ publication patterns and whether it ensures an alleged citation advantage as opposed to non-gold OA publications.</p>

<p>"...The goal of the “Austrian Transition to Open Access (AT2OA)” project is to support the large-scale transformation of scientific publications from Closed to Open Access, and to implement measures supporting this initiative. The project aims to increase Austria’s Open Access publication output by restructuring licence agreements with publishers and by providing targeted support for researchers’ publication activities. It will also establish new venues for Open Access publishing. The subprojects will examine the following topics: (1) Impact analysis of the transition to Open Access. (2) Funding for transitional Open Access business models. (3) Publication funds. (4) Support for Open Access publications and alternative Open Access publication models. These subprojects will be supplemented by networking and knowledge transfer activities."</p>

<p>Thanks for joining me today Lars. How long have you been part of the OASPA Board, and why did you join?</p>

<p>It’s my fifth year with OASPA; I’ve been involved with the organisation from the beginning. Way back in 2008, I started having conversations with Caroline Sutton, Ahmed Hindawi, Paul Peters, and others, and it became clear there was the need for a collective voice for dedicated open access publishers. In the months following, I helped to organise and host our first Conference on Open Access Scholarly Publishing in Lund, in 2009...."</p>

<p>"Abstract: Open educational resources (OER) are teaching, learning, and research materials in any medium that reside in the public domain or that have been released under an open license that permits no-cost access, use, adaptation, and redistribution by others. OER confer significant dollar savings while also giving learners ready access to a wide range of high-quality, highly flexible educational materials. Open content offers faculty a means to customize curriculum to better align with learner needs and interests and to collaborate in new ways with peers worldwide.  </p>

<p>The 7 Things You Should Know About... series from the EDUCAUSE Learning Initiative (ELI) provides concise information on emerging learning technologies. Each brief focuses on a single technology and describes what it is, where it is going, and why it matters to teaching and learning. Use these briefs for a no-jargon, quick overview of a topic and share them with time-pressed colleagues.  </p>

<p>In addition to the 7 Things briefs, you may find other ELI resources useful in addressing teaching, learning, and technology issues at your institution. To learn more, please visit the ELI Resources page."</p>

<p>"Florida State University can add a new distinction to its academic record books as eight faculty members have earned grants from the Fulbright Scholar Program this year. The Fulbright scholars will head out during the 2018-2019 school year to locations around the world to teach and conduct research in the United Kingdom, Ireland, Poland, Malawi, France, Italy, Canada and Denmark....</p>

<p>Micah Vandegrift, formerly FSU’s director of digital scholarship for University Libraries, has received a Fulbright-Schuman Innovation grant to research open science policy at Maastricht University in the Netherlands and at the Royal Danish Library in Copenhagen. Vandegrift recently left Florida State to join the library at North Carolina State University as its first Open Knowledge Librarian. Vandegrift will research how science and education policies of the European Union affect the work of research librarians, and he will join a national Digital Humanities working group exploring technology infrastructure for new research methods. Vandegrift also plans to develop a “policy-to-praxis” toolkit with colleagues at host institutions. “Librarianship is an applied discipline, so I intend for my research project to feed directly into a resource that can be utilized immediately,” he said. While he will fulfill his Fulbright opportunity as an employee of NC State, Vandegrift credits Florida State’s Office of Faculty Development and his time working for University Libraries Technology and the Digital Scholarship department as formative and critical to having won the fellowship. “FSU Libraries created an environment for me to form the ideas and questions that led to this award through my work since 2011,” he said. “I am forever indebted to that organization and its central role in my Fulbright experience.”</p>

<p>"Peter Cherry, PhD, Medmeme’s vice president, information systems, explores how pharma can identify predatory journals and conferences</p>

<p>High volumes of clinical and drug research data are being generated across the world every day. While this information can bring critical insights to pharma companies; it can also lead them down a wrong and costly path if it turns out to be fake or unsubstantiated. ‘Fake data’ has become increasingly prevalent throughout modern academia, where it can be difficult to distinguish genuine publications from predatory ones and legitimate conferences from those that exist purely to make money from those keen to ‘publish or perish’. On the issue of predatory journals, an article in Nature last year by Katarzyna Pisanski - a researcher in the School of Psychology at the University of Sussex, Brighton, UK, and the Institute of Psychology at the University of Wrocław, Poland - and colleagues said: “Thousands of academic journals do not aspire to quality. They exist primarily to extract fees from authors.” The Nature article added: “These 'predatory' journals exhibit questionable marketing schemes, follow lax or non-existent peer-review procedures and fail to provide scientific rigour or transparency. The open-access movement, although noble in its intent, has been an unwitting host to these parasitic publishers.”..."</p>

<p>"...The world of software has accomplished great advancements with the support of open source.  And we believe that cloud design as open data will bring about a similar evolution to the world of IT infrastructure. It will be because this kind of free modification and distribution enables the reproduction of value and unleashes the potential ingenuity and productivity of creators on a grand scale. Nevertheless, our actual society does not yet have consistent rules that define open data and regulate how it is used. It is a matter of copyrights, database rights, and other laws that are individually regulated by each nation. Thus, for those of us who are advancing the accumulation of open data, the ideal approach is to receive uniformly clear licenses from creators when we collect cloud designs. Fortunately, the pioneers of the open movement have arranged a variety of methods to make such licenses simpler, and we will look at which of these methods is most appropriate for cloud design below...."</p>

<p>"For many of us, the primary stakeholders that come to mind for open education include students, faculty, librarians, bookstores and textbook publishers. It might even be easy to think of additional stakeholders at the campus level—distance learning, registrar’s office, etc. When my library is working on OER initiatives, these are the stakeholders we think of too.</p>

<p>However, we don’t often enough think about open education stakeholders beyond the academic community. There are actually many more potential stakeholders that work on public interest issues. For example, when I talk to friends in the nonprofit, community organizing, media and labor fields, they see open educational resources as relevant to their interests and concerns. However, they don’t always know that libraries, universities and information organizations like SPARC (as well as Wikimedia, Creative Commons, etc.) have been working on these initiatives for years. Nor do they know that open education is an international movement. There is much more we can do to engage these potential allies.</p>

<p>During my fellowship at SPARC, the focus of my work is to build and strengthen SPARC’s relationships with public interest and social justice organizations in order to expand the open education movement outside the primary academic stakeholders. A major goal of this project is to keep librarians at the forefront of these initiatives as conduits who are organized, knowledgeable and collaborative. My work will focus on engaging four main stakeholder groups: Labor ...Media....Community Groups ....Student Groups..."</p>

<p>"The Wikimedia Foundation (WMF)’s Community Programs team supports a diverse international community of program leaders working with cultural heritage institutions and communities to expand the impact of Wikimedia’s projects as educational platforms. As part of this work, a significant international community of organizers develops partnerships and programs that document heritage and share the collections and expertise of Galleries, Libraries, Archives and Museums (GLAMs) on Wikimedia projects -- a community known as the GLAM-Wiki community. The new Program Officer joins an existing team that supports, facilitates, and amplifies GLAM-Wiki and other cultural heritage work through better understanding and implementation of scalable project models, greater cross-regional and international partnerships among GLAM-Wiki volunteers, and deeper communication about GLAM-Wiki beyond the Wikimedia movement. Supporting the Wikimedia Movement Strategic Direction’s “Knowledge Equity” emphasis, this role will support the needs of Wikimedia communities working in contexts currently not well supported by the existing GLAM-Wiki community. This work will mostly be focused on working with emerging Wikimedian communities[1], many of which are in Latin America, Africa or Asia, as well as communities everywhere working with underrepresented, marginalized, or colonized knowledge. This role will lead the production of documentation, training, and outreach to help the GLAM-wiki community overcome technical and programmatic challenges, especially in applying and understanding workflows for digitization, collecting living heritage through “Wiki Loves” type programming, and working with Commons and Wikisource to represent knowledge from those communities. ..."</p>

<p>Google English: ""The research culture has to change to make data sharing a rule and not an exception" - Tuuli Toivosen Open Data Champions Interview</p>

<p>The many obstacles to access to data generated by publicly available data - and the potential for exploiting data - have given the geographer Tuuli Toivonen an interest in open data at a time. According to Toivonen, awarded with Open Data Champions, researchers should be aware of data sharing practices at an early stage.</p>

<p>Last year, the SPARC Europe library community awarded three researchers from the University of Helsinki - Tuuli Toivonen , Ari Asm and Mikko Tolonen - with the Open Data Champions award granted for the promotion of open research data (see also Flamma News ). The Think Open blog publishes interviews with HY researchers who have been awarded in July.</p>

<p>The series is started by Tuuli Toivonen, associate geographer and geoinformatics. This interview has been made on the basis of an original English-language interview .</p>

<p>Why do you consider sharing data as important? What helped you understand the importance of sharing data?</p>

<p>As a researcher about 15 years ago, I needed the data produced by the authorities in my research work. Negotiations on obtaining data lasted for a long time, and sometimes the necessary datasets were simply too expensive to acquire. It was frustrating to know that valuable data had been collected without it being available. Frustration was especially strong when the collection of data was answered by a publicly funded institution that did not have its own resources to analyze data. We then stated that the data generated by public funds must be used by researchers. Or even better, we thought the data would be accessible to all without restrictions. This would reduce administrative workload and lower the threshold for cooperation between researchers, businesses and active citizens and the resulting innovation. Later, partly thanks to the Open Data Movement and the European-wide operation (eg the INSPIRE Directive), the authorities began to distribute their data openly in Finland. This created the basis for the emergence of new research and reduced the time spent on administrative processes...."</p>

<p><i>By guest blogger</i> <a href="http://www.multipledrafts.com/">Dan Jones</a></p>
<p>Amid all the talk of a “<a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2016/09/16/ten-famous-psychology-findings-that-its-been-difficult-to-replicate/">replication crisis</a>” in psychology, here’s a rare good news story – a new project has found that a sub-field of the discipline, known as “experimental philosophy” or X-phi, is producing results that are impressively robust.</p>
<p>The current crisis in psychology was largely precipitated by <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2015/08/27/this-is-what-happened-when-psychologists-tried-to-replicate-100-previously-published-findings/">a mass replication attempt</a> published by the Open Science Collaboration (OSC) project in 2015. Of 100 previously published significant findings, only 39 per cent replicated unambiguously, rising to 47 per cent on more relaxed criteria.</p>
<p>Now a paper in <em>Review of Philosophy and Psychology</em> <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s13164-018-0400-9">has trained the replicability lens on the burgeoning field of experimental philosophy</a>. Born roughly 15 years ago, X-Phi takes the tools of contemporary psychology and applies them to unravelling how people think about many of the major topics of Western philosophy, from the metaphysics of free will and the nature of the self, to morality and the problem of consciousness.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><span id="more-34238"></span></p>
<p>Take one of the <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/1467-8284.00419">earliest and most well-known findings from the field</a>. Back in 2003, Joshua Knobe, now at Yale University, set out to study what determines whether we describe the outcome of someone’s behaviour as intentional or not. Knobe ran two short vignettes by his participants. One described the CEO of a company being brought a new business plan by his VPs that would cause harm to the environment. The CEO says “I don’t care about harming the environment, go ahead”. The project proceeds and the environment is duly hurt.</p>
<p>In that case, most people say that the CEO intentionally harmed the environment. But switch the word “harm” to “help” and now people are reluctant to say that the CEO intentionally helped the environment, even though in both cases the CEO was indifferent to harming or helping the environment as a side effect of his business activities. This asymmetry, known as the <a href="https://thepsychologist.bps.org.uk/volume-22/edition-8/good-bad-and-intentional">Knobe effect</a>, revealed how moral considerations affect our deployment of ostensibly non-moral concepts, like intentionality.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>X-Phi has generated great excitement making it essential to see whether the pall of the replicability crisis darkens this field too. So the X-Phi Replicability Project (XRP) – a collaboration between twenty research teams in eight countries, devised by Brent Strickland of the Institut Jean Nicod, Paris, France and led by Florian Cova of the Swiss Centre for Affective Sciences, University of Geneva, Switzerland – set about re-running a representative sample of 40 X-Phi studies to see how the field is holding up (the sample comprised the most cited X-Phi papers from 2003-2015, two random papers for each year, and a few extra to bring the total to 40).</p>
<p>There are numerous criteria that can be used for determining whether a study replicates or not. The XRP used three: a subjective assessment by the replicating team; whether the replication achieved a statistically significant result in the same direction as the original study; and whether the effect sizes of the original and replication studies were comparable. The XRP found that X-Phi studies replicated 78 per cent of the time according to the first two criteria, and 71 per cent of the time judged by the third – way better than the 39-47 per cent for psychology as whole, although other specific sub-fields like <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2017/06/05/these-nine-cognitive-psychology-findings-all-passed-a-stringent-test-of-their-replicability/">cognitive psychology</a> have also reported promising results.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>“It’s wonderful news,” says Knobe. “And it’s a bit ironic, because the whole approach of X-Phi was modelled on the techniques used in the rest of psychology, yet we ended up with this higher replicability!”</p>
<p>Why is X-Phi doing so well? A big part of the field’s success seems to come from the kinds of studies it focuses on. Specifically, 78 per cent of the studies in the XRP sample were “content-based”, meaning they looked at how participants’ behaviour, beliefs or judgments changed depending on the task or stimuli they were given (e.g., Knobe’s changing of the word “harm” to “help” to elicit different judgments about intentional behaviour), rather than being observational or demographic-based (looking at aspects of individuals that predict differences in outcome), for instance. And such content-based studies – whether in psychology as a whole or in X-Phi – replicate better than other kinds of study: 90 per cent replicated in the XRP sample (compared to 21-31 per cent for other designs), and 65 per cent in the OSC sample. Notably, content-based studies comprised just 34 per cent on the OSC sample – less than half the proportion found in X-Phi – giving X-Phi a higher overall replicability rate.</p>
<p>In addition, the effect sizes studied in the predominantly content-based studies of X-Phi might typically be larger than in the rest of contemporary psychology – and as the OSC found, studies that report large effect sizes tend to replicate better. One reason for this could be that the effects X-Phi explores are powerful enough to be available to introspection. The Knobe effect, for example, has an intuitive, natural feel to it – one that Knobe sensed but needed to confirm empirically. And the XRP found that early X-Phi studies tended to produce especially large effect sizes, adding plausibility to the idea that they tapped into low-hanging, introspectively visible psychological fruit.</p>
<p>A cluster of other factors may be giving X-Phi a boost. X-Phi studies tend to be cheaper and easier to run than in many areas of psychology. Often, all you need are some written vignettes and a few questions about them, and a way of delivering this material to people – a process made easy by the widely used Amazon Mechanical Turk survey platform. That means that researchers may be less invested in a given study, and feel less pressure to “p-hack” the data to produce a positive, publishable, but ultimately unreliable, result. This take is backed up by the XRP’s statistical analysis that found less evidence of p-hacking in X-Phi compared to psychology generally. What’s more, X-Phi researchers also seem to be more comfortable publishing null or negative results: while such papers comprised just 3 per cent of the total in the OSC, they made up 10 per cent of XRP’s sample.</p>
<p>The success of X-Phi can’t be emulated by simply choosing to investigate psychological phenomena with large effect sizes. Nor does the high replicability of content-based studies mean that psychologists should restrict their research to these kinds of studies, which Knobe says would be absurd.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Florian Cova agrees, but says that the fact that some study designs tend to produce more robust findings than others should not be ignored. “If we know that certain kinds of studies are more likely to produce fragile results or false positives, we can adjust our study designs in these cases to try to minimise these risks.”</p>
<p>Perhaps the broadest lesson for other psychologists is the importance of basing studies on detailed theories, rather than just looking for interesting or quirky psychological phenomena. “Research in X-Phi is usually driven by a rich theory that predicts what we should expect to happen,” says Knobe. Such theory-driven research could make null results more palatable and take the pressure off needing to find some positive result to squeeze out of the data. “If we run a study in which the predicted effect doesn’t occur, that null result is still a publishable finding because it speaks to whether the theory is true or not.”</p>

<img alt="" class="webfeedsFeaturedVisual wp-post-image" height="150" src="http://blogs.plos.org/neuro/files/2018/07/AYAHUASCA-150x150.jpg" style="display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;" width="150" /><p>For any of the 300 million individuals worldwide suffering from depression, a fast-acting, effective treatment can mean the difference between life and death. Yet despite the growing number of pharmaceutical agents advertising relief from sadness, replaced by joy and contentment, their efficacy is often staggeringly slow and poor. In contrast to the promise of immediate happiness, many drugs can leave patients numb, lethargic, fighting unpleasant side-effects, and sometimes even more deeply depressed. A likely reason for the failure of many past anti-depressants is our still incomplete understanding of the neurobiological bases for this debilitating disease. This knowledge gap precludes efforts to ease depression through chemical means. Hence, the search continues for a rapid-acting, reliable therapy. Naturally available treatment options that offer little commercial incentive have remained overlooked by pharmaceutical research. However, mounting research suggests that nature may have provided an effective means to relieve depressive symptoms, in the form of a ceremonial psychedelic brew that’s been appreciated for centuries for its mind-altering and mood-enhancing properties. After early reports that ayahuasca may be a viable alternative to the countless failed pharmaceutical therapies, a team of Brazilian researchers put it to rigorous testing and <a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/psychological-medicine/article/rapid-antidepressant-effects-of-the-psychedelic-ayahuasca-in-treatmentresistant-depression-a-randomized-placebocontrolled-trial/E67A8A4BBE4F5F14DE8552DB9A0CBC97" rel="noopener" target="_blank">found promising anti-depressant effects</a> in this age-old spiritual medicine.</p>
<p><strong>A spiritual psychedelic brew</strong></p>
<p>Ayahuasca is an intoxicating brew used by Amazonian cultures for spiritual and medicinal purposes. It combines psychoactive plants containing the psychedelic dimethyltryptamine (DMT), and several monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs). Effects often last up to six hours, and include altered consciousness, sensory changes, introspection, elevated heart rate and blood pressure, vomiting, and in some cases, intense distress. Because ayahuasca can notably evoke mystical experiences and religious revelations, it has been widely used to promote spiritual awakening.</p>
<p><strong>Ayahuasca the anti-depressant </strong></p>
<p>Ayahuasca has previously been found to attenuate depression severity, but until now, its therapeutic potential had not been rigorously studied in a clinical trial. In their recent double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, Dr. Fernanda Palhano-Fontes, of the Federal University of Rio Grande do Norte, and colleagues tested the drug in 29 patients with treatment-resistant depression. On average, these individuals were moderately to severely depressed and had tried nearly four anti-depressants without success.</p>
<p>Participants consumed a single dose of either ayahuasca or placebo, after which they sat quietly under supervision while the drug took effect. Depression was assessed using two depression scales before the ayahuasca session and one, two and seven days after. Compared to patients who drank placebo, those who ingested the active brew reported fewer depressive symptoms as soon as a day later, with an even stronger reduction a week later (see Figure). By the end of the week, more patients in the ayahuasca group (64%) than the placebo group (27%) responded positively to the treatment. Although remission rates for the ayahuasca group (36%) were on average higher than placebo (7%), this difference was not significant, perhaps due to an unusually high placebo effect. The improvements in mood were not without unpleasant side-effects, notably nausea and vomiting.</p>
<figure class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_19602"><a href="http://blogs.plos.org/neuro/files/2018/07/Ayahuasca_depression.jpeg"><img alt="" class="size-medium wp-image-19602" height="199" src="http://blogs.plos.org/neuro/files/2018/07/Ayahuasca_depression-300x199.jpeg" width="300" /></a>Depression ratings are lower for ayahuasca than placebo one to seven days after intake.</figure>
<p><strong>The depressed brain on psychedelics</strong></p>
<p>This trial was an important step towards validating ayahuasca as an anti-depressant, a treatment option implicated by only a handful of prior studies. Others found that ayahuasca elicits <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25806551">anti-depressant effects</a> up to three weeks and <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26650973" rel="noopener" target="_blank">alters brain blood flow</a>, but these studies were small and not placebo-controlled, the gold-standard for clinical testing. These mood-regulating benefits may not be limited to ayahuasca, as other psychedelics have similarly demonstrated therapeutic efficacy. A <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2215036616300657" rel="noopener" target="_blank">small study</a> reported that psilocybin, the psychoactive compound in hallucinogenic mushrooms, alleviated depressive symptoms a week to three months later, though this trial was not placebo-controlled. Several <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16894061" rel="noopener" target="_blank">randomized controlled trials</a> have demonstrated that the psychedelic anesthetic ketamine reduces depression symptoms as soon as two hours and up to one week later.</p>
<p>Besides offering hope for fighting depression, the rapid and robust benefits observed from ayahuasca provide valuable insight into the still mysterious neurobiological genesis of depression. To understand the mood-stabilizing powers of ayahuasca, we can look to its array of constituent chemicals. The pool of MAOIs in ayahuasca prevent the degradation of monoamines, a class of neurotransmitters implicated in depression that includes serotonin, dopamine and norepinephrine. The “monoamine hypothesis” of depression–which posits that monoamine deficits play a causal role–is <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10775017" rel="noopener" target="_blank">considered inadequate</a> to fully explain the pathogenesis of depression. However, the benefits of ayahuasca support the theory that rebalancing monoamine neurotransmission can at least partly help to combat depression. Moreover, DMT is a serotonin agonist, meaning that it activates the brain’s serotonin receptors. However, existing drugs that act as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (e.g., Prozac, Paxil or Zoloft) also increase serotonergic activity through different means, but have relatively limited efficacy. By preventing the breakdown of several monoamines through its MAOI activity, rather than targeting a particular neurotransmitter that <em>may or may not</em> be deficient in the individual patient, ayahuasca may offer a more generalizable therapy than conventional serotonergic drugs.</p>
<p>These effects are likely augmented by DMT’s activation of sigma-1 receptors, which regulate calcium signaling and have been implicated in depression, among other psychiatric conditions. MAOIs and sigma-1 receptors also promote neurogenesis and increase brain growth factors, which may further help to regulate mood.</p>
<p><strong>The road to prescription</strong></p>
<p>Is ayahuasca the miracle drug we’ve long been awaiting to combat depression? Despite the promising evidence supporting its therapeutic potential, many outstanding questions need to be addressed before the psychedelic is prescribed in a clinical setting. The drug’s anti-depressant effects are fast-acting, but further research is needed to determine the duration of these effects and the optimal dosing regimen. Regular supervised, mind-altering trips that consume several hours may be impractical if frequent dosing is required. An equally pressing question is whether the side effects would preclude regular use and patient compliance. Though its non-addictive profile and absence of lasting changes to cognition or personality make ayahuasca an appealing option, the vomiting and hallucinations that often accompany the ayahuasca experience could be deal-breakers for patients desiring a less invasive therapy. Because psychedelic trips can sometimes be accompanied by negative experiences, including sensory or cognitive distortions, additional research is warranted to better characterize their neurobiological properties. Thus, it may be some time before the carefree laughter of an ayahuasca-user infiltrates the mass of TV drug advertisements. But at the very least, ongoing research into its antidepressant properties will bring us closer to understanding how our brain chemistry supports a healthy emotional state.</p>

<p><em>By guest blogger</em> <a href="https://forbiddenpsychology.wordpress.com/">Tomasz Witkowski</a></p>
<p>We could say without exaggeration that the discovery of a means of achieving full control over oneself is something of a “holy grail” for psychology. There is nothing to indicate that we are getting any closer to finding one, but recent decades have brought us a growing number of discoveries that at least partially allow us to enhance self-control mechanisms. One of them is the light which has been shed on the importance of rituals in boosting self-control. Now in a <a href="http://psycnet.apa.org/record/2018-22169-001">new paper</a> in the <i>Journal of Personality and Social Psychology</i>, Allen Ding Tian and his collaborators have examined whether enacting rituals (defined as “a fixed episodic sequence of actions characterised by rigidity and repetition”) can enhance subjective feelings of self-discipline, such that rituals can be harnessed to improve behavioural self-control.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><span id="more-34223"></span></p>
<p>The researchers planned and carried out six interesting experiments. For the first they recruited 93 undergraduate women at a gym who had a goal of losing weight. All participants received the same instructions to try to reduce their calorie intake over a 5-day period, but half were told to be “mindful” about their food consumption, whereas the other half were taught a three-step pre-eating ritual to remind them to reduce calorie intake. Before every meal they had to cut their food into pieces before consuming it. Next, they rearranged the pieces so that they were perfectly symmetric on their plates, and finally they had to press their eating utensils against the top of their food three times.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>It appears that rituals really can boost self-control. Participants who enacted a pre-eating ritual reported significantly lower calorie consumption than those who attempted to be mindful about what they ate.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>The researchers decided to replicate this study in a laboratory and find out if any random gestures would have the same beneficial effect as repeated rituals. The participants learned they would be completing a taste test of carrots and chocolate. They received four bags from the experimenter: three contained a baby carrot, one a chocolate truffle. First, they had to eat two carrots, while preceding each act of eating with either: the exact same set of ritual movements (involving knocking the table with their knuckles, closing their eyes and counting, among other things); a set of random gestures that were similar to the ritual movements but different each time (so they didn’t resemble a ritualised script); or no behaviour. Next, the participants could choose whether to eat the remaining carrot or the truffle. Participants who had enacted a ritual before eating the first two carrots tended to make the healthier choice compared with individuals in the other groups.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Two further experiments involved participants either twice enacting a ritualised set of movements (though they were not labelled as such); performing one set of random gestures; or doing nothing (control group). Then they made a choice between a Snickers bar or a healthy Odwalla bar. Again, the ritual group showed greater self-control and this seemed to be driven by the way that rituals boosted their feelings of self-discipline (as measured by their agreement with statements like “I felt mentally strong when making this decision”).</p>
<p>A fourth experiment assessed the effect of rituals in another self-control context—prosocial decision-making. Participants were asked to imagine that they had been invited to a friend’s party that would be a lot of fun. They were then informed that they had received an unexpected email from an affiliated charity organisation requesting their attendance that same evening at a public fundraiser. They must decide which event to go to, but before taking the decision, one group of the participants twice performed a series of ritual movements, while other groups either engaged in a one-off series of random gestures, or they took their decision immediately. The link between performing rituals and greater self-discipline was confirmed again with the ritual group showing a greater preference for the charity fundraiser.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>A final experiment in the series demonstrated that rituals only affect decision making when a self-control conflict is involved (such as choosing between a fundraiser and party), not when choosing between two options where self-control is not an issue (such as choosing between two fun parties).</p>
<p>Note that, unlike cultural rituals, all of the rituals used in the experiments were devoid of meaning. Incorporated into various spheres of our lives, cultural rituals sometimes contribute to improving self-discipline, but there are also others which induce us to abandon self-control; these include rituals surrounding the shared consumption of celebratory meals, during which excessive self-discipline can even be taken as rudeness.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>The results of the presented studies are quite promising for anyone who would like to boost their self-control, but the authors also demonstrate how many aspects of rituals remain unexplored. One of the more interesting questions that researchers may engage concerns the potential difference in increase in self-discipline with rituals created by individuals for their own purposes, and those adopted from or even imposed by the surrounding environment. Also, does the effectiveness of a ritual depend on the amount of effort put into it? Do rituals repeated often and without requiring attention also enhance self-control? All this remains to be explored by future research.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

					<div class="elementor-text-editor elementor-clearfix"><p>The pursuit of new drugs to treat and cure human diseases is one of the noblest things in our civilization. However, 6 out of 10 drugs fail during the clinical trials, making the lengthy and expensive R&amp;D process a proverbial double-edged sword. High rates of failure are often attributed to the poor predictability of 2D cell cultures and animal models that are used to test drugs during the preclinical stage. The unreliability of these models is why researchers are turning to “mini organs” in a dish, popularly known as organoids, to better understand the effects of experimental drugs on human organs. Organoids are miniaturized 3D replicas of human organs that are created by culturing stem cells or progenitor cells in a medium simulating extracellular matrix (ECM) properties.</p><p>Organoids have numerous impactful applications, but their applicability in disease modeling is especially noteworthy. They can be used to recapitulate human pathophysiology in vitro, providing a golden opportunity to study and treat human diseases in a 3D environment. Organoids for all major organs have already been produced. For example, bioprinted 3D liver and kidney tissue, liver-on-a-chip models, and lung-on-a-chip models are made available by Organovo, Tissue Dynamics, and <a href="https://www.scienceexchange.com/labs/alveolix-bern">AlveoliX</a>, respectively. TissUse, a Berlin-based company, has taken this technology one step further by creating interconnected multiple organs on a chip, aka a “human-on-chip” that allows researchers to visualize how different organs interact with drugs collectively.</p><p>This organoid technology has the potential to transform the field of precision medicine. The day when a scientist will be able to completely diagnose and cure people using their simulated forms in vitro does not seem so far away. Science Exchange believes this technology can do a world of good for R&amp;D, which is why we have established an exhaustive network of qualified providers to make organoid products and services readily available. Listed below are a few inventive organoid technologies. If you find something that interests you, click on the provided link and request more information.</p></div>

margin-bottom: 0cm;"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;">Not only did Van Wezenbeek attach answers to my questions but she informed me that VSNU has now published the contracts it has signed with both Springer Nature and Taylor &amp;

<img alt="" class="attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image" height="110" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2018/07/Fig-3-Bale-monkey-at-Kokosa-forest-fragment-FF-Photo_Addisu-Mekonnen-140x110.jpg" style="display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;" width="140" /><p>The Bale monkey (<em>Chlorocebus djamdjamensis</em>) is an tree-dwelling, rare primate species restricted to a small geographic range – less than 12,500 square kilometres – in the southern Ethiopian Highlands. Bale monkeys in intact forest habitats are bamboo specialist herbivores that rely on a single species of highland bamboo (<em>Arundinaria alpina</em>) accounting for 77-81% of their annual diet, which is mostly young leaves and shoots.</p>
<p>Habitat alteration and climate change are the major threats to biodiversity conservation, particularly for those specialist, rare species inhabiting small geographic ranges. These species are assumed to be less flexible at adapting to a changing environment than generalist species. Similar to other bamboo specialist mammals, such as giant pandas and bamboo lemurs, Bale monkeys are currently at high risk of extinction because of habitat alteration.</p>
<p>Bale monkeys are classified as a Vulnerable species by the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species with a total population size of less than 10,000 individuals and a general trend of population decline.</p>
<figure class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_10363" style="width: 650px;"><img alt="" class="wp-image-10363 size-large" height="211" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2018/07/Fig-1-Three-Chlorocebus-species-found-in-Ethiopia-A-Bale-monkey-B-grivet-monkey-and-C-vervet-monkey-1024x338.png" width="640" /><div class="attachment-image--caption">Three Chlorocebus species found in Ethiopia. A. Bale monkey. B. Grivet monkey. C. Vervet monkey.</div><div class="attachment-image--source"></div></figure>
<p>In addition to Bale monkeys, Ethiopia harbours two other <em>Chlorocebus</em> species: the vervet monkey (<em>C. pygerythrus</em>) and the grivet monkey (<em>C.</em><em> aethiops</em>). These two species are widely distributed in Africa, semi-terrestrial ecological generalists, inhabiting a variety of habitats and consuming a diverse diet of plant species and invertebrates.</p>
<p>Studies have shown that understanding the population genetic structure of endangered species is essential to designing successful science-based management plans to ensure long-term survival. Thus, we aimed to investigate the genetic diversity and phylogeography of Bale monkey populations inhabiting continuous forest and forest fragments using mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA).</p>
<p>We collected a total of 119 Bale monkey faecal samples from May to December 2013 at three localities in continuous forest and nine localities in fragmented forests. We extracted, amplified and analysed mtDNA from these samples. We also included a total of 12 samples from other green monkeys in Ethiopia for the purpose of comparison.</p>
<h3><strong>Deep genetic differentiation</strong></h3>
<p>It was very surprising to find a strong and deep genetic differentiation between the Bale monkey populations inhabiting continuous forest and those inhabiting fragmented forests dating back 2.8 million years and corresponding to their geographic structuring.</p>
<blockquote><p>There is strong and deep genetic differentiation between the Bale monkey populations inhabiting continuous forest and those inhabiting fragmented forests dating back 2.8 million years</p></blockquote>
<p>Remarkably, Bale monkeys in fragmented forests are more closely related to their sister species (vervets  and grivets) than their conspecifics in continuous forest, suggesting hybridization between Bale monkeys in forest fragments with vervets and grivets found in the surrounding region associated with habitat alteration.</p>
<p>Bale monkeys inhabiting intact bamboo forests of the Bale Mountains form monophyletic group, suggesting they are the source population of Bale monkeys and are not likely to be hybrids.</p>
<p>Bale monkey populations in continuous forest and forest fragments not only differ in their genetics but also in their ecology, morphology and gut microbiota. These differences further support the hypothesis that gene flow has already altered the gene pool of Bale monkey population in fragmented forests, making these monkeys ecologically flexible and more similar to other <em>Chlorocebus </em>species.</p>

<h3><strong>The future of Bale monkeys</strong></h3>
<p>As a result of a clear and deep genetic structuring between Bale monkey populations in continuous forest and forest fragments, we therefore propose two separate management units when implementing conservation strategies for Bale monkeys. For continuous forest Bale monkeys, we recommend improved protection of their intact bamboo forest habitat. For the fragmented forest population, we recommend connecting forest fragments to increase gene flow between isolated groups.</p>
<p>Overall, the results of this study increase our general understanding of how habitat fragmentation and hybridization together have shaped the genetic structure of the rare, range-restricted and bamboo-specialist Bale monkey.</p>
<p>We do acknowledge, however, that our genetic analysis should be interpreted with caution because we used a single and maternally inherited mtDNA locus that tells us only about the maternal history. Further research focusing on bi-parentally and paternally inherited genetic markers, as well as morphological and ecological studies is needed to understand the evolutionary history of this unusual species.</p>

<p>Part of my role at the Digest involves sifting through journals looking for research worth covering, and I’ve sensed that modern social psychology generates plenty of studies based on questionnaire data, but far fewer that investigate the kind of tangible behavioural outcomes illuminated by the field’s classics, from Asch’s conformity experiments to Milgram’s research on obedience to authority. A new <a href="https://spb.psychopen.eu/articles.php?id=25025">paper</a> in <i>Social Psychological Bulletin </i>examines this apparent change systematically. Based on his findings, Dariusz Doliński at the SWPS University of Social Sciences and Humanities in Poland asks the bleak question: is psychology still a science of behaviour?</p>
<p><span id="more-34199"></span></p>
<p>Doliński is following in the footsteps of <a href="https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1745-6916.2007.00051.x">a paper</a> published over a decade ago, which looked at the January 2006 contents of what Doliński describes as social psychology’s “flagship” publication, the <i><a href="http://www.apa.org/pubs/journals/psp/">Journal of Personality and Social Psychology</a></i>, published by the American Psychological Association. Roy Baumeister and colleagues sought research that involved behavioural outcomes more active than “finger movements” – typing on a computer, clicking a mouse or filling in a survey by hand. They found active behavioural outcomes were measured by only 12 per cent of studies published in the journal that month, compared to an estimated 80 per cent in the same journal 30 years earlier.</p>
<p>Was this a blip, or a trend? Doliński looked at six issues of the <i>Journal of Personality and Social Psychology</i> published in the second half of 2017. He found that from 45 empirical articles, only four went beyond participants answering questions or filling in surveys; overall, only 6 per cent of the analysed studies measured actual behaviour.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Moreover, when behaviour was studied, it was frequently nothing more than another case of finger movement. One study measured whether people would over-report their achievements on an experimental task; another looked at endurance in solving cognitive tasks; a third involved the “prisoner’s dilemma”, a financial game that doesn’t require any overt behaviour as such. Only one study looked at a truly active behaviour – the social interactions of pre-school children. Doliński likely had his tongue only partly in cheek when wondering whether this approach would still have been used if pre-school children were comfortable filling in questionnaires.</p>
<p>What’s behind this anti-behavioural turn? Some of it is connected to the cognitive revolution: the recognition in psychological science that internal processes like memory, learning and attention are crucial to understanding behaviour. This has been immensely useful and worth celebrating, but it doesn’t exclude studying a diversity of behaviours as well.</p>
<p>Doliński raises a few other obvious pressures that are harder to celebrate. Studying behaviours is more difficult, and often more costly and expensive, than studying verbal declarations. Behaviours are also harder to verify (was that spontaneous gesture friendly or unfriendly?) and to record. It may also be harder to convince ethics boards to approve a behavioural study than another survey study. In addition, observed behaviour is often binary and one-shot per participant. You offer help to cross a street; you return the found item; you go to vote; you sign the petition,… or you don’t. Not only does this often call for larger sample sizes, it limits how you can analyse the data, making it harder to produce persuasive models of pathways between mechanisms.</p>
<p>As a concrete example of how the behavioural instinct has been blunted, Doliński points to a piece of research on physical intimacy (from the journal issues he reviewed) that did make the effort to go into the field. Experimenters visited a clinic providing flu shots, but did they observe how waiting patients interacted, or how closely they approached the receptionist or stood in line? No: they simply asked people more questions.</p>
<p>This matters because declarations of behavioural intentions do not always translate to behaviours. For instance, lottery winners rarely donate their cash to charity, even though more than a quarter of survey respondents claim they would give substantially. Also, while the very robust “bystander effect” shows that people are less likely to act to counter a transgressive act when others are present, people asked to describe their hypothetical actions believe they would be as likely to act whether several other people are also present or not. Similarly, recent work canvassing opinions on the Milgram experiment <a href="https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2017.01632">showed</a> that most people believe they would not have carried out the experimenters’ orders, <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2017/05/05/new-milgram-replication-finds-90-per-cent-of-polish-participants-willing-to-deliver-highest-shock/">even though most people do</a>.</p>
<p>Doliński worries that social psychologists doing the important work of field studies, and those studying behaviour more generally, are being shut out of the best journals in their field. Social psychology is already going through a process of reform as it responds to concerns about research quality. Perhaps it should take this opportunity to also consider adjusting its incentive systems to make more of research that does the best it can to see how psychological manipulations impact the world.</p>

Papers will speak to the epidemic and the strategies being developed to address it. Due to their structural similarity, this special issue uses the umbrella term “opioids” to also include opiates.</p>
<h3><strong>Public health crisis</strong></h3>
<p>North America and Europe are currently grappling with a public health crisis associated with widespread access to prescription opioid analgesics, enhanced purity of heroin, the introduction of potent fentanyl compounds, and a rising tide of opioid overdose fatalities. In the United States, prescriptions for hydrocodone and oxycodone exploded beginning in the late 1990s. Now, more than 2 million individuals in the United States have an opioid use disorder. Most of these individuals were introduced to opioids via a prescription for an opioid analgesic (either for themselves or another party).</p>
<blockquote><p>more than 2 million individuals in the United States have an opioid use disorder</p></blockquote>
<p>Prescription drug monitoring programs have resulted in a drop in the prescription of opioid analgesics and patients dependent on opioids feel compelled to shift to the use of illicit heroin or a synthetic opioid. As a result, overdoses are on the rise and overdose fatalities exceeded 63,000 in 2016. Fentanyl derivatives now make a major contribution to the current opioid crisis, and over a short period of time they have become the substances most associated with overdose mortality. Drug overdose deaths remain high in Europe, and according to the European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction, opioids are implicated in the majority of cases. These deaths have become the face of the opioid epidemic.</p>
<h3><strong>Addiction treatment</strong></h3>
<p>The good news is that treatment works. A recent study found that treatment of opioid use disorder with either methadone or buprenorphine following a nonfatal opioid overdose is associated with significant reductions in opioid related mortality. A barrier to positive long term outcomes, however, is the lack of access and retention in treatment. Exciting advances are being made to reformulate some of the traditional opioid agonist therapy (i.e., methadone and buprenorphine) to improve patient adherence to treatment. An opioid antagonist therapy (i.e., extended-release naltrexone) provides an alternative to agonist therapy. Psychosocial therapy combined with either agonist or antagonist medication facilitates healthier lives and lifestyles.</p>
<p>Naloxone distribution and opioid overdose education have saved many lives. Programs such as Get Naloxone Now (http://www.getnaloxonenow.org) are effectively training care providers and community members on how to save lives.</p>
<h3><strong>Call for papers</strong></h3>
<p>Addiction health services research is on the front lines in the fight to address the opioid epidemic. The papers in this special issue illustrate applications of these tools in North American and Europe. Manuscripts submitted before January 30, 2019 will be reviewed for inclusion in the issue. See the call for papers announcement.</p>

<p>Many animals, including sea lions and dogs, can accurately predict the size and strength of a potential adversary in part by listening to their vocalisations – such as the ferocity and depth of their barks or growls. People weren’t thought to be much good at doing something similar. But in previous studies, volunteers were asked to judge the <i>absolute</i> height and strength of another person, based on the sound of an aggressively-spoken sentence or a ‘roar’. Now in <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2589004218300579">a new study</a>, published in <i>iScience</i>, when participants were instead instructed to listen to recordings and judge how much stronger, or weaker, taller or shorter the vocaliser was, <i>compared with themselves</i>, they could do this with a high degree of accuracy.</p>
<p>As the researchers, led by David Reby at the University of Sussex, point out, this is potentially far more practically useful than being able to discern someone else’s absolute height or strength.</p>
<p><span id="more-34192"></span></p>
<p>The researchers recorded 30 male and 31 female drama or acting students at the University of Sussex, who were instructed to imagine themselves in a battle or war scenario, about to charge and attack, and to utter “That’s enough, I’m coming for you!”, followed by a “non-verbal vocalisation” expressing the same motivation (these usually sounded like roars). The researchers then measured each student’s height and also their flexed bicep circumference and handgrip strength, which were used to produce a single strength score for each person.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>One group of listeners rated relative strength. These were 45 men and women recruited from Tromso (and surrounding rural towns) in Norway (all were fluent English speakers), and from the University of Sussex. They also had their own handgrip strength and flexed bicep circumference measured.</p>
<p>A separate group of 56 people from the US rated the vocalisers’ relative height, and self-reported their own heights.</p>
<p>These listeners rated all the vocalisers on a 101 point scale, from -50 (much weaker / shorter) to +50 (much stronger / taller), with the slider’s default position set to 0 (“same as you”). <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>The researchers found that overall both men and women were fairly good at identifying whether the vocalisers were relatively stronger/weaker and taller/shorter than themselves. For example, when judging roars – which, for male (but not female) vocalisers increased perceived strength more than the aggressive sentence – male listeners correctly rated vocalisers who were substantially stronger than they were as being stronger 88 per cent of the time (and never ranked such vocalisers as being weaker).</p>
<p>But analysis of the finely-scaled judgements made using the 101-point sliding scale also revealed some biases. There was a general tendency for women to over-estimate male vocalisers’ relative strength, and men to under-estimate women’s relative strength.</p>
<p>The researchers say this fits with previous findings of a general tendency for women to underestimate, and men to over-estimate their abilities. However, given that men are, on average, stronger than women, from an evolutionary perspective, it may be safer for a woman to err on the side of caution, and assume that the (invisible) owner of a male voice is significantly stronger, as she’ll be right more often than not.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Overall, though, as has been demonstrated with other mammals, “both male and female listeners can use available formidability cues conveyed in aggressive speech and roars to make ecologically relevant judgements about speakers with a high degree of accuracy,” the researchers conclude.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

<figure class="wp-caption alignleft" id="attachment_10255" style="width: 227px;"><img alt="" class=" wp-image-10255" height="163" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2018/06/Wild-potato-Solanum-venturi-300x225.jpg" width="217" /><div class="attachment-image--caption">Wild potato</div><div class="attachment-image--source"></div></figure>
<p>We studied two different races of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phytophthora_infestans">Irish potato famine pathogen</a>, and we discovered that the difference invirulence between these races could not be ascribed to a genetic difference but rather to a difference in the expression of the underlying virulence gene. This adds to our knowledge of how this important scourge on world agriculture evolves to evade plant immunity.</p>
<h3><strong>Why is this work important?</strong></h3>
<p>As our colleague <a href="https://twitter.com/markgijzen/statuses/841336667789225984">Mark Gijzen tweeted</a>, “is this a rare and unusual curiosity or another example of a widespread biological phenomenon?” Indeed, there are few other examples in related plant pathogens, including the soybean root rot pathogen that Mark studies. This finding has far reaching implications. It indicates that these pathogens can evolve even more rapidly than anticipated thus counteracting the efforts of plant breeders to deploy disease resistant crops.</p>
<h3><strong>Are potato varieties resistant to the pathogen available?</strong></h3>
<p>Yes, there are. But there are several examples of potato cultivars that were initially resistant to late blight when farmers started to grow them, but succumbed to the disease a few years later. The ability to switch on and off virulence genes such as we found in this research may partly explain why the pathogen is so effective at overcoming the plants defense barriers.</p>
<blockquote><p>There are potato varieties initially resistant to Phytophthora infestans that have succumbed to late blight a few years later.</p></blockquote>
<h3><strong>What is currently done to control the disease?</strong></h3>
<p>Susceptible potato cultivars must be protected by repeated applications of fungicides. If left unchecked, the disease will destroy the leaves and stems in a matter of days as in the pictured trial plot of potato varieties in the highlands of Peru.</p>
<h3><strong>Is chemical protection the only way to control late blight?</strong></h3>
<p>In nature, there are wild relatives of the cultivated potato and many of them can withstand the disease (see image of potato variety field trial). Breeders identify the genes in these plants and introduce them to cultivated potato through crosses or genetic transformation.</p>

<h3><strong>How did you put this project together?</strong></h3>
<p>We studied an Andean lineage of the Irish potato famine pathogen known as EC-1 so the project had an international flavor from day one. Ours was a wide reaching multinational collaboration bringing together scientists based in the UK, Japan, Netherlands, USA, Philippines, and Peru. It’s how science often goes on these days. Experts from all over the world team up to solve problems, make new discoveries and advance our knowledge.</p>
<h3><strong>Anything you would have done differently?</strong></h3>
<p>DNA sequencing technology develops so fast that by the time the paper gets published you wish you could apply a different method. It also takes more time to analyze the data, write up the paper etc. than to generate the sequence data. This can be frustrating.</p>
<h3><strong>You </strong><a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2017/03/11/116012"><strong>posted the paper in bioRxiv before submission</strong></a><strong>. Why?</strong></h3>
<p>Why not? Posting the article on bioRxiv enabled us to share our findings with our colleagues and hear about it from the community <a href="http://asapbio.org/preprint-info/preprint-faq">as soon as possible</a>. The tweet by Mark Gijzen we referred to above is an example of such feedback. Posting a preprint relieves some of the delays associated with publishing. It’s a liberating feeling to finish writing up a paper and immediately share it with anyone who’s interested.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://blog.scienceexchange.com/2018/07/qa-with-li-cor/">Q&amp;A with LI-COR</a></h4>

<p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/gursatya/"><b>Guru Singh</b></a><b>, Director of Scientific Content of Science Exchange, recently spoke with Jim Wiley, Director of Marketing, Biotechnology at </b><a href="https://www.scienceexchange.com/labs/li-cor-biosciences"><b>LI-COR Biosciences</b></a><b>. Follow the interview below.</b></p>
<p><b>What should Science Exchange users know about LI-COR?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We are committed to making research reproducible. To illustrate, LI-COR is the only company that has developed methods required by journals and funding agencies to ensure that the Western blot data submitter is ready to produce robust and replicable data. We are also the only company in the Western blot market to deliver training materials/courses to educate the researcher on the above methods. These are available in the new LI-COR Lambda U<img alt="™" class="wp-smiley" src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/2.4/72x72/2122.png" style="height: 1em;" /> learning portal. Also, our Custom Services group can provide exploratory/confirmatory Western blot services and antibody validation services, which relate to journal requirements and ensure research reproducibility.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Just as important, LI-COR has expertise in IRDye® products (IRDye infrared fluorescent dyes) used for surgical, therapeutic, and diagnostic applications. There are over 20 ongoing clinical trials that have propelled the use of these dyes. Unlike other life science companies, we have the products, tools, and services that can successfully help researchers take their ‘probe’ from benchtop to clinic. Custom services also include probe labeling, probe validation, and probe manufacturing (non-cGMP and cGMP).</span></p>
<p><b>What makes your offerings unique?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Only LI-COR has developed the full solution that includes products, tools, and services to set researchers up for success in delivering the most accurate, robust, and replicable Western blot data. Innovation was required to define and develop new protocols; there was no precise definition of how to calculate ‘replicates’ for Western blotting. LI-COR worked with the Journal of Biological Chemistry (JBC) to create a definition (and later a protocol) that will now be enforced.</span></p>
<p><b>What are your primary proprietary technologies?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Our proprietary technologies include the Odyssey® Imager, IRDye infrared dyes, and the related methods/protocols developed to match the journals’ and funding agencies’ stringent data creation/submission requirements.</span></p>
<p><b>How is your molecular imaging superior to the chemiluminescent-based detection?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are limitations to film and visible fluorescent detection methods that make them very difficult to hit all the requirements. One example is the requirement that one must prove that their target and normalization signal are both in the same linear range of detection. This is straight-forward when using LI-COR products.</span></p>
<p><b>Tell me about your global presence.</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">LI-COR Biotechnology products are supported globally by a network of distributors and are used in more than 100 countries. We sell directly to the US, Canada, and 11 European countries.</span></p>
<p><b>Interesting. How big is your company? (e.g., number of employees, funding status, etc.)</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">LI-COR has been in business for over 45 years and currently consists of 300 employees. Since LI-COR is a private company, we cannot comment on our funding status.</span></p>
<p><b>What type of certifications does your company have? (e.g., GxP, minority-owned, women-owned, etc.)</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We are ISO 9001:2015 certified.</span></p>
<p><b>How is your technology different than that of your competitors?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is not just one technology that separates LI-COR from the competition, but that we offer the complete package of products (imagers, software, and reagents), tools (protocols and educational materials), and services (training from expert scientists and customer services). These were developed to aid researchers in getting the best data possible, all in alignment with the new publisher requirements.</span></p>
<p><b>Whom do you serve? What does your current client base look like?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We serve researchers that utilize Western blots or are involved in probe development in their research in all markets including academia, the pharmaceutical industry, biotechnology, and government agencies.</span></p>
<p><b>How has your partnership with Science Exchange been?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We are inspired by Science Exchange’s mission to drive science forward by matching the research needs of scientists with the best solution providers. Science Exchange has been a terrific partner for introducing LI-COR to researchers who are looking for what LI-COR experts can offer through our Custom Services group.</span></p>
<p><b>Before we wrap up, do you have any final message to Science Exchange users?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Take advantage of LI-COR’s over 20 years of experience in quantitative Western blotting and infrared dye applications. Our scientific experts have developed the methods and protocols that you need to successfully create the best data possible. If you need custom services and/or manufacturing, LI-COR scientists will partner with you to deliver the best results possible.</span></p>

<figure class="wp-caption alignleft" id="attachment_10349" style="width: 310px;"><img alt="" class="wp-image-10349 size-medium" height="182" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2018/07/4193153605_e07578c81a_b-300x182.jpg" width="300" /><div class="attachment-image--caption">Flickr: Karl Birrane</div><div class="attachment-image--source"></div></figure>
<p>Individuals suffering from prostate or breast cancer can experience symptoms such as emotional distress, fatigue and sleep difficulties resulting in a decrease in their quality of life. While previous studies have identified the benefits of hypnosis and other group interventions in reducing fatigue and emotional distress in breast cancer patients, a study by Grégoire <em>et al. </em>published in <em>BMC Cancer</em> sought to identify whether these types of interventions would also be beneficial to prostate cancer patients.</p>
<p>The study assessed 25 men with prostate cancer and 68 women with breast cancer before and after a self-hypnosis/self-care group intervention. The researchers then analyzed the impact this group intervention had on the patients’ quality of life, sleep difficulties and fatigue.</p>
<p>Interestingly, the results of the study showed that, whilst the female breast cancer group experienced positive effects of the intervention on various symptoms including depression, anxiety and fatigue, the male prostate cancer group reported no effect. The researchers suggest that this may be due to the greater difficulties and different cancer treatments the breast cancer group experienced prior to the intervention compared to the prostate cancer group. The male prostate cancer group also reported few problems with distress, sleep or fatigue prior to the intervention, which may have contributed to the lack of reported improvement on these symptoms.</p>
<p><em><strong>BMC Rheumatology: </strong></em><strong><a href="https://bmcrheumatol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s41927-018-0023-x">Knee osteoarthritis and patients’ beliefs<img alt="" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-10350" height="300" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2018/07/arthrocalman-2384253_960_720-300x300.jpg" width="300" /></a></strong></p>
<p>A study by Darlow <em>et al.</em>, published in <em>BMC Rheumatology</em>, investigates the beliefs that patients with knee osteoarthritis have the disease, as well as how these beliefs are formed and the impact they have on participating in activity, self-management and health behavior. Thirteen individuals from New Zealand with knee osteoarthritis were interviewed.</p>
<p>The study found that patients were often uncertain of how to interpret their daily symptoms, and what they can do to influence the rate of decline. This resulted in patients believing that joint replacement is the only effective option available to them. Ultimately, misunderstandings about knee osteoarthritis led to a negative impact on the individuals’ participation in activity, their health behaviors and their self-management.</p>
<p>The researchers concluded that improving the provision of information to those with knee osteoarthritis may help guide positive health behavior and self-management decisions.</p>
<p><em><strong>BMC Public Health</strong><strong>:</strong></em> <a href="https://bmcpublichealth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12889-018-5557-8"><strong>Association between sleep duration and metabolic syndrome</strong></a></p>

Previous studies have investigated the link between differing lengths of sleep duration and various diseases such as obesity, hypertension and hyperglycemia.</p>
<p>In a study published by <em>BMC Public Health</em>, Kim et al. studied the association between sleep duration and metabolic syndrome in Koreans aged 40-69 years old. This cross-sectional study analyzed the data of over 130,000 individuals from the years 2004-2013. Sleep categories assessed were less than 6 hours, 6 to less than 8 hours, 8 to less than 10 hours and at least 10 hours.</p>
<p>The researchers found that less than 6 hours of sleep a day was associated with metabolic syndrome in men, and elevated waist circumference in men and women. More than 10 hours of sleep was associated with elevated waist circumference, reduced high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and elevated fasting glucose in women, whereas elevated triglycerides and metabolic syndrome were associated with more than 10 hours sleep in both men and women.</p>

<p>Two new BMC journals opened for submissions in June. <em>BMC Biomedical Engineering</em> will focus on the combination of tools and methods from biology and medicine with mathematics, physical sciences and engineering with the ultimate goal of improving human health. <em>BMC Chemical Engineering</em> will encompass the production of, use, transformation, transportation and reuse of chemicals, biochemicals, materials and energy.</p>
<p>Both journals are now open for submissions, and many more journals will soon be launched to expand the scope of the BMC series beyond biology and medicine and into engineering. Both journals are open access and peer reviewed, and neither makes editorial decisions on the basis of the interest of a study or its likely impact. The first articles will be published in November 2018.</p>
<p><strong><em>BMC Pulmonary Medicine:</em> <a href="https://bmcpulmmed.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12890-018-0672-y">Earlier smoking after waking and the risk of asthma</a></strong><strong><img alt="" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-10354" height="200" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2018/07/cigarette-3022376_960_720-300x200.jpg" width="300" /></strong></p>
<p>Research conducted by Arielle Selya, Sunita Thapa and Guarav Mehta investigated whether smoking within 5 minutes of waking up (an indicator of nicotine dependence) was independently associated with asthma. Outcomes of asthma assessed included lifetime asthma, past-year asthma, and having had an asthma attack in the past year.</p>
<p>The researchers found that smoking within 5 minutes of waking up was associated with an approximately 50% increase in the likelihood of lifetime asthma and past-year asthma retrospectively. It was also associated with a 4 times increase in the likelihood of lifetime asthma. These findings may be used in order to refine the risk assessments of asthma among smokers.</p>

In a paper published by <em>BMC Infectious Diseases</em>, Butler-Laporte <em>et al.</em> assess whether a score based on patient factors and MRSA colonization is able to predict the risk of MRSA infection in cases of <em>S. aureus</em> bacteremia, to inform the need for empiric coverage.<p></p>
<p>The researchers found that MRSA colonization surpassed all other factors to be the only reliable and independent predictor of MRSA infection. Further patient diseases or disorders were not adequate predictors of MRSA colonization. The study results indicate that a clinical approach based on a patient’s known MRSA colonization status and on local susceptibility patterns may be appropriate.</p>

In a paper published by <em>BMC Evolutionary Biology</em>, Yoshizawa <em>et al. </em>used this species as a model to study the genetic mechanisms which underlie ASD.<p></p>
<p>Although the researchers do not believe the behaviors between humans and fish are at the same levels of complexity, their findings do suggest that the behaviors in both species are evolutionarily conserved. The study surveyed genes that share the same evolutionary ancestor between cavefish and humans and similarities were identified. They also surveyed evolved genes in the cavefish lineage, finding that ASD-risk genes evolved at twice the rate of other genes across the cavefish genome. The study concludes that the evolution of humans and fish share basic neural networks that generate ASD-like behaviors.</p>

<p>People who’ve had an out-of-body experience (OBE) report that their conscious awareness shifted outside their physical body – often upwards, so they felt like they were floating above their own head. It’s thought that OBEs occur when the brain fails to properly integrate data from the different senses, including vision, touch, proprioception (the sense of where the limbs and other body parts are located in space) and from the vestibular system (organs in the inner ear that monitor head orientation, balance and motion).<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Previous research has mostly focused on the role of vision and touch – for example by triggering the illusion of viewing one’s own body – but the vestibular system has largely been neglected. If it does play an important role we should expect that problems with the vestibular system – which often present as feelings of dizziness – lead to OBEs, but do they? <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Historical case studies suggested that they might. And now, published in <em>Cortex</em>, the <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28669509">first systematic study</a> of patients referred to a neurological specialist because of dizziness has found that they can.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><span id="more-34162"></span></p>
<p>Christophe Lopez, a neuroscientist at Aix Marseille University, and Maya Elziere, a neurologist specialising in balance disorders at the Hôpital Européen, also in Marseille, France, compared 210 patients referred to them for dizziness and vertigo (having the feeling of spinning, swaying or tilting, being off balance, or that the room is spinning) with the same number of age and gender-matched controls. They found that the patients were much more likely to report having had an OBE – 14 per cent had had at least one, compared with 5 per cent of the healthy controls. And most of these patients reported having an OBE only after their dizziness had started.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>During their OBE, most of the patients reported vestibular sensations – of elevation and lightness, for example. (One reported a “sensation of entering my body, like in an envelope, from the top”). The vast majority of these patients also reported having had not just one but multiple OBEs, which usually lasted for a few seconds or a few minutes.</p>
<p>OBEs were linked mainly to dizziness caused by obvious problems with the vestibular system itself such as vestibular neuritis and Meniere’s disease (rather than being brain-based). Yet, most patients with these same vestibular problems did not develop OBEs so something else must be going on to contribute to the experience. Questionnaire results showed that scores for “depersonalisation-derealization”, depression and anxiety, were the main predictors of OBE in patients with dizziness, suggesting these psychological factors interact with the physical problem<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>of atypical signals being sent from the vestibular system to generate OBEs. In healthy controls, there was also a relationship between depersonalisation-derealization scores and reported OBEs. This isn’t a surprise: depersonalisation-derealization involves feelings of observing yourself from outside your body, or having the sense that things around you aren’t real.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>As anxiety was also a significant predictor – and anxiety is known to be linked to vertigo – “we suggest that anxiety and depersonalisation-derealization may combine to precipitate OBE in patients with dizziness,” the researchers write.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

<p>As well as their cost-saving appeal, the rationale for large open-plan offices is that they are expected to act as a crucible for human chemistry, increasing face-to-face encounters between colleagues to the benefit of creativity and collaboration. Unfortunately it’s well-established that <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2013/08/19/the-supposed-benefits-of-open-plan-offices-do-not-outweigh-the-costs/">most workers don’t like them</a>, such is the fundamental human need for privacy and <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2015/03/27/why-its-important-that-employers-let-staff-personalise-their-workspaces/">control over one’s environment</a>. Now <a href="http://rstb.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/373/1753/20170239">a pair of quasi-experimental field studies</a> published in <em>Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society B</em> suggest that the supposed collaborative advantage of open-plan offices also doesn’t pass muster.</p>
<p><span id="more-34170"></span></p>
<p>Ethan Bernstein and Stephen Turban, at Harvard Business School and Harvard University, respectively, recruited 52 employees at the global headquarters of a Fortune 500 multinational company that was about to undergo a redesign of an entire floor, stripping out the individual cubicles to create a fully open-plan workspace.</p>
<p>The participants, whose roles included sales, technology and human resources, wore a “sociometric badge” and microphone for three weeks prior to the redesign. Then a couple of months after the office refit, they wore the badge and microphone again for another three weeks.</p>
<p>The bluetooth-enabled electronic badges and the microphones allowed the researchers to monitor the frequency of the employees’ face-to-face interactions. The company also granted access to their servers so the researchers could look for any changes in use of email and instant messenger.</p>
<p>The results were stark: after the shift to an open-plan office space, the participants spent 73 per cent less time in face-to-face interactions, while their use of email and instant messenger shot up by 67 per cent and 75 per cent respectively.</p>
<p>A second study involving 100 employees at another Fortune 500 company was similar but this time the researchers monitored changes to the nature of the interactions between specific pairs of colleagues before the shift to an open-plan office compared with afterwards.</p>
<p>There were 1830 interacting dyads and, of these, 643 reduced their amount of face-to-face interaction after the workspace became open-plan, compared with just 141 showing more physical interaction. Overall, face-to-face time decreased by around 70 per cent across the participating employees, on average, with email use increasing by between 22 per cent and 50 per cent (depending on the estimation method used).</p>
<p>If you’ve ever sought refuge from the gold-fish bowl of an open-plan office environment by cocooning yourself with headphones, or if you’ve decided you’d rather not have that challenging conversation with a colleague in front of a large group of your peers, and opted to email them instead, then these findings will come as little surprise.</p>
<p>However, while a great deal of research has established <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2013/08/19/the-supposed-benefits-of-open-plan-offices-do-not-outweigh-the-costs/">employees’ negative feelings about open-plan offices</a>, both in terms of lost privacy and adverse effects on communication, this is the first study to provide an objective measure of the impact of an open-plan space on how people interact.</p>
<p>The real-life setting of this research is a major advantage but it does of course come at the expense of full experimental control and it remains a possibility that other factors, besides the office design change, may explain the results. The researchers did attempt to mitigate this possibility, such as by allowing time for the employees to settle into the new office design before resuming data collection.</p>
<p>“While it is possible to bring chemical substances together under specific conditions of temperature and pressure to form the desired compound, more factors seem to be at work in achieving a similar effect with humans,” the researchers said. “Until we understand those factors, we may be surprised to find a reduction in face-to-face collaboration at work even as we architect transparent, open spaces intended to increase it.”</p>

Frankly, I don’t understand why this information needs to be secret, although I suppose it fits with the secrecy that has always surrounded Dove. When I interviewed Dove’s Tim Hill in 2008 he refused to tell me who the owners of Dove were and denied that (despite what some believed) there was any connection between Libertas Academica (LA) and Dove, or with him (aside from the fact that the owner of LA was his son). </span></i></b></div><div class="MsoPlainText"><br /></div><div class="MsoPlainText"><b><i><span>Then, when in 2010 I <a href="https://poynder.blogspot.com/2016/02/why-i-wont-be-doing-that-video.html">emailed him</a> to point out that New Zealand Companies House records that he had one time been the sole director and shareholder of LA, and had in fact  been a director of LA when he told me in 2008 that there was no connection, he responded, “Henceforth I will not be providing you with any comment or information on any subject.” In 2016, I tried to make contact with Dove directors Graeme Peterson and Kevin Toale, neither of whom responded. </span></i></b></div><div class="MsoPlainText"><br /></div><div class="MsoPlainText"><b><i><span>Can you tell me why there has always been this kind of secrecy surrounding Dove? OA advocates argue that scholarly publishing is primarily funded by the taxpayer and so should be transparent both in process and financing. There is now also a widespread belief that there should be even greater transparency with regard to medical research, and those who publish it, not least because it is felt that pay-to-publish OA has made it easier for pharmaceutical and medical device companies to use scholarly papers as marketing tools. Do you agree that there are dangers here and that greater transparency is essential? </span></i></b></div><div class="MsoPlainText"><br /></div><div class="MsoPlainText"><b><span>DK:</span></b><span> I do believe that there should be transparency in all scholarly publishing, both in traditional subscription and open access publishing. <a href="https://publicationethics.org/">COPE</a>, <a href="https://oaspa.org/">OASPA</a>, <a href="http://www.wame.org/">WAME</a> and the <a href="https://doaj.org/">DOAJ</a> have collaborated to identify <a href="https://publicationethics.org/resources/guidelines-new/principles-transparency-and-best-practice-scholarly-publishing">Principles of Transparency and Best Practice in Scholarly Publishing</a>, and these principles form part of the criteria on which membership applications to those organizations are evaluated. All Dove journals are <a href="https://bit.ly/2JeQrsr">included in the DOAJ</a> and have “<a href="https://doaj.org/faq#thetick">the tick</a>”, which means they have met the high level of compliance to these criteria. </span></div><div class="MsoPlainText"><br /></div><div class="MsoPlainText"><span>All Dove journals are also members of COPE and have met their membership criteria also.</span></div><div class="MsoPlainText"><br /></div><div class="MsoPlainText"><span>I don’t think that there has been secrecy around Dove Medical Press.

Nothing in our due diligence suggested anything to the contrary. </span></div><div class="MsoPlainText"><br /></div><div class="MsoPlainText"><span>Tim Hill (from Dove) is Tom Hill’s father, and he may have helped his son establish Libertas Academica in the first instance.

This <a href="https://oaspa.org/dove-medical-press-reinstated-as-oaspa-members/">led to their OASPA membership being reinstated</a>, resulted in an extremely robust peer review process described in detail in their peer review schematic on <a href="https://www.dovepress.com/editorial_policies.php?content_id=3526">this page</a>. </span></div><div class="MsoPlainText"><br /></div><div class="MsoPlainText"><span>In fact, some of the additional checks they have added since that schematic was published go way beyond what most publishers do in their peer review process. </span></div><div class="MsoPlainText"><br /></div><div class="MsoPlainText"><span>These are in addition to the usual ethical checks which quality medical journals perform, and include: checking the affiliations of all authors and checking retractionwatch.com to identify whether any of the authors have been involved in unethical practices; manuscripts being checked for duplicate submission or publication and run through the SciDetect software; and IP address checks to make sure that there is no COI between author, reviewer and Editor. </span></div><div class="MsoPlainText"><br /></div><h3><span style="font-size: large;">Due diligence</span></h3><h2></h2><div class="MsoPlainText"><br /></div><div class="MsoPlainText"><b><i><span>RP: Publishing a schematic is surely a good idea.

We need that kind of transparency to be able to investigate whether the owners have financial interests, e.g. with pharma companies, that might compromise the integrity of their journals.” When I asked OASPA for the reason Dove had withdrawn I was told, “We had a few exchanges by email following your article and they then withdrew their membership.

And at the time when OASPA terminated Dove’s membership in 2013 he referred back to the Amy Bishop paper and said that it had disappeared from its website without “any proper retraction notice/process”.

<img alt="" class="attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image" height="110" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2018/05/chimp-e1530716663298-140x110.jpg" style="display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;" width="140" /><h3><strong>Palaeoproteomics – Exciting new frontiers</strong></h3>
<p><a href="https://www.york.ac.uk/archaeology/research/current-projects/former-research/palaeoproteomics/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Palaeoproteomics</a> is the new-kid-on-the-block in archaeological science and evolutionary biology. <a href="http://www.shh.mpg.de/878736/protein-guide" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Standards</a> of practice have only recently been set out for this burgeoning field of investigation, used recently to study ancient <a href="https://www.archaeology.co.uk/articles/pondering-the-possibilities-of-proteomics.htm" rel="noopener" target="_blank">humans</a>, <a href="https://www.spectroscopyasia.com/article/zooms-collagen-barcode-and-fingerprints" rel="noopener" target="_blank">animals</a>, and even <a href="http://science.sciencemag.org/content/316/5822/277">dinosaurs</a> (though this is somewhat disputed).</p>
<p>Ancient protein sequences are incredibly robust compared to ancient DNA, with proteins recently retrieved from samples as old as <a href="http://www.sciencemag.org/news/2016/09/oldest-ever-proteins-extracted-38-million-year-old-ostrich-shells">3.8 million years</a>.</p>
<h3><strong>Bioinformatics techniques</strong></h3>
<p>Single amino acid polymorphisms (SAPs), areas in the proteome where one amino acid (AA) difference occurs, are useful to determine evolutionary differences between clades, including late Pleistocene hominins like Neanderthals and <a href="https://genographic.nationalgeographic.com/denisovan/">Denisovans</a>.</p>
<p>Error-tolerant searches (wherein the algorithm can ‘learn’ when examples received have been corrupted in some way) correctly inferred SAPs in <a href="http://www.nature.com/articles/nature14249">Collagen Type 1</a> of modern and Pleistocene samples, but as Dr Welker notes, this “needs to be demonstrated [in a whole proteome] before moving on to the analysis of older and possibly more divergent hominin fossils”. This is the basis of the experiments reported in his <a href="https://bmcevolbiol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12862-018-1141-1">recently-published paper in <em>BMC Evolutionary Biology</em></a>.</p>
<h3><strong>The cross-species proteomics effect problem</strong></h3>
<blockquote><p>As you go further back in time on the evolutionary tree, larger proteomic sequence differences occur between your target species and their more-distant relatives.</p></blockquote>
<p>Until now, the cross-species proteomics effect (CSPE) problem hadn’t been demonstrated to be overcome by error-tolerant searches – essential for confidence in palaeoproteomic investigations.</p>
<p>The CSPE problem derives from using a different reference proteome from your target population or species. As you go further back in time on the evolutionary tree, larger proteomic sequence differences occur between your target species and their more-distant relatives.</p>
<p>The larger the number of sequence differences, the more likely that peptides and proteins will not be identified in standard (non-error-tolerant) searches. The small proteome databases available for hominin species compound the effect.</p>
<h3><strong>Error-tolerant vs Standard search experiment</strong></h3>
<p>Error-tolerant searches should allow for identification of SAPs, and overcome the CSPE issue. Dr Welker tested this using standard and error-tolerant searches of the proteomes of <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3873800/">7 modern human samples</a> against UniProt-derived human (<em>Homo sapiens; </em>‘<em>Homo s.’</em>), chimpanzee (<em>Pan troglodytes; </em>‘<em>Pan</em>’), and Sumatran orang-utan (<em>Pongo abelii; </em>‘<em>Pongo</em>’) reference databases using <a href="http://www.bioinfor.com/">PEAKS</a> (v 7.5).</p>
<p>For a protein to be confirmed, at least two unique <a href="http://sites.psu.edu/msproteomics/tag/psm/">peptide spectrum matches</a> (PSMs) with a FDR (false discovery rate) of 1% had to be identified when searching the modern samples against the <em>Homo s. </em>database in the general search. In error-tolerant searches, PSMs were accepted only when a peptide of 10 amino acids (AAs) or longer was matched in the <em>Homo s. </em>database.</p>
<p>Four outcomes were established for PSMs individually searched against orthologous databases in error-tolerant searches, and two outcomes in standard searches, viewable in Figure 1 in Dr Welker’s paper.</p>
<h3><strong>Evolutionary distance, and long peptides</strong></h3>
<p>No PSMs with three or more SAPs were identified, and mutable PSMs with AA lengths over 25 were almost never identified (Figure 4 in Dr Welker’s article). Mutable PSMs with 10-15 AAs were identified up to 75% of the time, regardless of evolutionary distance.</p>
<p>This could be problematic when comparing human proteomes with much older hominin ancestors – larger evolutionary distances may make it difficult to reliably reconstruct <a href="https://www.khanacademy.org/science/biology/her/tree-of-life/a/building-an-evolutionary-tree">phylogenetic trees</a>.</p>
<p>Welker recommends creating shorter peptides in palaeoproteomic studies, and searching against databases of species with less evolutionary distance, though the latter may more difficult with more ancient hominins.</p>
<p>Error-tolerant searches minimised the CSPE problem between moderately divergent proteomes (e.g. the human-chimpanzee split), and this should be kept in mind for future phylogenetic analysis of ancient hominin proteomes.</p>
<h3><strong>Filtering criteria to mitigate falsely-suggested AA substitutions</strong></h3>
<blockquote><p>Fast-evolving proteins provide more phylogenetic information compared to slow-evolving proteins, but their high substitution rates mean they may go unidentified in error-tolerant searches.</p></blockquote>
<p>Error-tolerant searches can miss-match PSMs, incorrectly suggesting PSMs that should not be mutated, confounding phylogenetic analysis. Welker determined filtering criteria to mitigate these off-target effects in error-tolerant searches:</p>
<ol>
<li>Two or more PSMs covering the mutated AA position must be confirmed.</li>
<li>These PSMs must comprise the majority of the total number of PSMs matching that AA position.</li>
</ol>
<p>These filtering criteria remove falsely-suggested AA substitutions, but can filter out correctly-substituted PSMs matching a single PSM, which could affect phylogeneticically-informative PSMs. Welker suggests running the same protein extract several times on a tandem mass spectrometer.</p>
<h3><strong>Informative proteins a potential target for phylogenetic studies</strong></h3>
<p>Fast-evolving proteins provide more phylogenetic information compared to slow-evolving proteins, but their high substitution rates mean they may go unidentified in error-tolerant searches. Welker revealed two fast-evolving proteins, with phylogenetically-informative positions sufficiently spaced to allow error-tolerant search identification, even at large evolutionary distances.</p>
<p>Alpha-2-HS-glycoprotein (<em>AHSG</em>) and fibrinogen alpha chain (<em>FGA</em>), frequently observed in ancient bone proteome datasets, present a viable target for proteomic phylogenetic studies.</p>
<h3><strong>Filling in the map</strong></h3>
<p>While there are limitations to error-tolerant searches in palaeoproteomic studies, Frido Welker has established filtering criteria and recommended experimental techniques to help maximise the potential for whole proteome investigations. Moreover, he has identified two potentially invaluable proteins for evolutionary studies.</p>
<p>Palaeoproteomics is a new field of study, with much of its potential and limitations still to be explored. Dr Welker’s paper has filled in a portion of the map of this largely-uncharted territory.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://www.maxplanckflorida.org/news-and-media/news/new-software-designed-for-rapid-automated-identification-of-dendritic-spines/">New Software Designed for Rapid, Automated Identification of Dendritic Spines</a></h4>

<h4>Researchers at the Max Planck Florida Institute for Neuroscience release open source software, connecting and building the neuroscience coding community.</h4>
<p>Is it possible for microscopes to learn a bit about the brain? Even be taught by neuroscientists to reliably recognize parts of brain cells… all on their own? Though it may seem like something straight out of “The Jetsons”, a neuroscientist and software engineer in the lab of MPFI’s Scientific Director, Dr. Ryohei Yasuda, Ph.D., is developing new software with the goal of vastly improving the daily life of a microscope user. Combining a specialized algorithm, aptly named a neural network with a small amount of training, microscopes can now autonomously and efficiently identify small neuronal compartments called dendritic spines with over 90% accuracy. Just like Rosie the robotic maid, microscopes equipped with this Spine Identification software are helping scientists streamline their daily routine, bringing research one step into the future.</p>
<p>In recent years, there has been a rapid expansion and advancement in powerful imaging technologies, capable of taking a look inside the brain with unprecedented resolution and sensitivity. From imaging technology alone, neuroscientists have gained an immense wealth of new information about the brain. But despite many advances in implementation and capabilities, powerful microscopes (and the software running them) are still lacking when it comes to ease of use and overall user experience.</p>
<p>In a new study published in PLOS ONE, Dr. Michael Smirnov, Ph.D., has created an imaging software he hopes will craft a new type of experience for users.</p>
<p>Smirnov explains that “When engineers and scientists design cutting-edge microscopes, they usually focus on the actual physical components and design. They are mostly interested in what these imaging technologies can do, what boundaries they can break and how they perform. Far less attention is placed on how these complex technologies can be made accessible for the average user and really improve their workflow. Each time I write my software, I always think about the user first; how can I make a difference for the person using it, make their research a little easier.”</p>
<p>The Yasuda lab studies the complex process called synaptic plasticity, which is thought to be the cellular basis of learning and memory. When single dendritic spines are stimulated, hundreds of signaling molecules are mobilized to carry new information throughout the neuron. Members of the lab investigate this process in detail utilizing 2-photon microscopy, hoping to glean insights into how the interplay of these molecules translates into memory.</p>
<p>Live 2-photon imaging experiments can be an intensive endeavor. Scientists must patiently sift through a neuron’s dendritic arbor, scanning hundreds of spines for suitable candidates to image. Experiments are frequently repeated to amass sufficient data and those that fail mid-way must be restarted. This often unspoken aspect can quickly turn prolonged imaging into a tedious and time consuming chore, ultimately slowing scientific progress.</p>
<p>Dr. Smirnov’s software aims to rescue neuroscientists from the humdrum of spine imaging. Weaving in an element of machine learning, the algorithm can be taught how to differentiate between dendrite backbone and dendritic spines after being fed a training data set of previously identified spines. Once the training period finishes, the software is capable of automatedly scanning through an image and demarcating spines it comes across with high precision. Unlike previously developed programs which can be computing intensive or optimized only for post imaging analysis, Smirnov’s software is fast, scalable and compatible with most live imaging setups and post analysis applications.</p>
<p>“We incorporated a machine learning approach, because we wanted our software to be flexible, adaptable and as easy to use as possible.” Says Smirnov “The program only requires the user to input an image and specify the scale. After that, the program does the rest.”</p>
<p>Smirnov describes that by automating the process of spine identification, the software has the potential to dramatically increase experiment workflow, shaving off hours of time. In addition, he has also made his program’s code readily available to the broader neuroscience community. A move he hopes will engage the community of coders working in the field and give them the ability to freely improve upon and customize the software, making it useful for wider applications.</p>
<p>Dr. Smirnov notes that Scientists at MPFI are not only committed to conducting high caliber basic neuroscience research, but also look for ways to continuously improve the research process; fast tracking new discoveries and positively impacting scientists’ daily lives.</p>

<img alt="" class="attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image" height="110" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2018/06/Fig1_Cotoras-140x110.jpg" style="display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;" width="140" /><p>Remote island archipelagos have long inspired scientists. They provide an opportunity to integrate ecological and evolutionary processes, advancing our understanding of the processes shaping biodiversity.</p>
<blockquote><p>The Hawaiian Islands are the home of some of the most spectacular events of massive diversification.</p></blockquote>
<p>This is particularly true when the component islands are arranged chronologically, as is found in “hotspot” islands that form a geological age gradient representing snapshots of biodiversity assembly through evolutionary time. Such islands provide simple and discrete systems, of known age and varying area, allowing them to serve as excellent “natural laboratories” for understanding the evolution of life under supreme isolation.</p>
<p>The Hawaiian Islands in particular are the home of some of the most spectacular events of massive diversification. More than a thousand species of <em>Drosphila</em> fruit files, tens of Honeycreepers and a vast variety of lobelioids plants, just to mention a few. All of them are examples of adaptive radiation.</p>
<p>Adaptive radiation is the evolutionary process by which a single ancestor can rapidly give rise to many species that diversify along different ecological axes. But, how does it happen? While many studies have examined the rate of diversification and patterns of ecological shifts, the missing element has always been the initial steps: How does a single species diverge ecologically in a way that allows it to co-occur in exactly the same site as its parent species?</p>
<p>In a <a href="https://rdcu.be/000q">recently published paper</a> at<em> BMC Evolutionary Biology</em> we examined this question by analyzing the population genetics of closely related species from an adaptive radiation of Hawaiian spiders in the long jawed genus <em>Tetragnatha</em>.</p>
<figure class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_10288" style="width: 650px;"><img alt="" class="wp-image-10288 size-large" height="428" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2018/06/Fig3_Cotoras-1024x685.jpg" width="640" /><div class="attachment-image--caption">Native Hawaiian forest at Puʻu Kukuʻi on West Maui</div><div class="attachment-image--source"></div></figure>
<p>Different species in this genus have been characterized by their color – whether <em>Green</em>, <em>Maroon</em>, <em>Small Brown</em> or <em>Large Brown</em> – and the substrates upon which they find refuge during the day (green leaves versus maroon mosses, brown twigs, or branches).</p>
<p>Given the exclusively nocturnal behavior of the spiders and their very limited visual capacity, diurnal predation is the most likely selective pressure responsible for the close color matching. The most likely predators are honeycreepers for which spiders can form an important component of the diet.</p>
<p>Within the radiation, species have tended to colonize from older to younger islands and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anolis_ecomorphs">ecomorphs</a> have arisen partly through <em>in situ</em> diversification producing closely related species of different ecomorph; and between-island colonization in which species pre-adapted to each of the niches arrive from older islands and subsequently differentiate in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allopatric_speciation">allopatry</a> without change in ecomorph.</p>
<p>The specific question we asked was, given that populations likely start diverging in allopatry without any change in ecomorph, at what stage do they come back together and interact in sympatry?</p>
<figure class="wp-caption alignright" id="attachment_10287" style="width: 220px;"><img alt="" class="size-medium wp-image-10287" height="300" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2018/06/Fig2_Cotoras-210x300.jpg" width="210" /><div class="attachment-image--caption">Male <em>Tetragnatha brevignatha</em> under a leaf on the Big Island of Hawaiʻi</div><div class="attachment-image--source"></div></figure>
<p>By focusing on close relatives of species of the same ecomorph that occur on the youngest islands of the Hawaiian chain, we were able to elucidate the initial stages of the process of adaptive radiation.</p>
<p>Major results were, first, that populations of the same species are highly structured, indicating that the first axis of separation between populations is likely allopatric. Second, we found that, within the focal set of taxa, genetically divergent lineages co-occur without evidence of hybridization.</p>
<p>This situation suggests that these genetically divergent lineages had already developed reproductive isolation when they came into secondary contact, yet this occurred prior to ecological divergence.</p>
<p>This contrasts what we find on older islands, where sister species are ecologically different (separate ecomorphs). Therefore, this study highlights a key period in the process of adaptive radiation when divergent and genetically separated taxa within the same ecomorph have the opportunity to interact.</p>

<p>If you are with someone who is ignoring you while they interact with their smartphone, you have been phone snubbed, or “phubbed”. Phubbing is common, at least in Western cultures – in a recent US survey, nine out of ten respondents said they had used their smartphone during their most recent social activity. There’s also evidence that it is socially harmful, leaving people less satisfied with their face-to-face interactions and generating feelings of resentment and jealousy. Now the <i>Journal of Applied Social Psychology </i>has published <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/jasp.12506?campaign=wolearlyview">a new study</a> exploring the reasons for these effects.</p>
<p><span id="more-34136"></span></p>
<p>The paper is based on PhD research by Varoth Chotpitayasunondh at the University of Kent, who, together with co-author Karen Douglas, asked mostly female student participants (average age 19) to watch a three-minute animation in which cartoon figures interacted and exchanged utterances that could not be heard but could be detected through mouth movements. Participants had to imagine themselves as the closest figure in the video and afterward make judgments about the conversation and how they felt.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>In one condition, the participants’ conversation partner’s phone remained unused on the table throughout the conversation. In another version, their partner’s attention was quickly drawn to something on their phone and they spent the rest of the interaction phubbing, keeping their gaze on the screen as they periodically swiped it while smiling and chuckling at what they saw. A third condition involved the participants’<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>partner engaging in bursts of phubbing interspersed with periods where they ignored their phone.</p>
<p>The 128 participants took a dim view of phubbing. The more it was present, the worse they considered both the quality of the interaction and the calibre of the relationship.</p>
<p>The researchers believe that phubbing has this effect because it is seen as form of social exclusion, analogous to when people have no choice but to eat alone at the school cafeteria or find that their friends don’t return their calls. The twist is that this exclusion occurs while sharing a physical encounter and, at least notionally, interacting – note that in the animations, the (unheard) conversation did not cease during phubbing.</p>
<p>Consistent with this account, Chotpitayasunondh and Douglas found that phubbing adversely affected participants’ fundamental needs, including their sense of belonging, need for meaning and self-esteem, just as is found for more traditional forms of social exclusion. The more phubbing threatened these needs (except meaning), the more the participants felt poorly about the interaction and the relationship, and this was true regardless of how typical and socially acceptable they considered phubbing to be.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Chotpitayasunondh and Douglas point out that evidence for their social exclusion explanation doesn’t prevent phubbing having an impact through other means, such as “norm violation” – feeling insulted by a partner’s incivil behaviour, and they suggest more research into such mechanisms.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>The new findings elaborate our understanding of a subtle but ubiquitous aspect of our daily experience, one that can easily create vicious cycles of detachment, and leave even planned attempts to connect together as events where we remain partly absent.</p>

On 7 April 2010 the Spanish diabetes researcher Margarita Lorenzo, Professor of Biochemistry at the Complutense University in Madrid, died of metastatic melanoma, aged only 51. Two months after her death, Lorenzo’s colleagues submitted a paper to the journal Diabetes (published by American Diabetes Association), which was accepted for publication 4 weeks later. These colleagues, primarily the … <a class="more-link" href="https://forbetterscience.com/2018/07/04/another-dead-scientist-framed-with-manipulated-data/">Continue reading <span class="screen-reader-text">Another dead scientist framed with manipulated data?</span> <span class="meta-nav">→</span></a>

A paper in Psychological Science was taking a beating on Twitter last month.

In this post, I'm not going to talk about the paper itself but rather, about how it came to be published and how preregistration - a concept I have long advocated - may be being misused.

The paper reports on five studies which all address the same general question. Of these, Study #3 was preregistered and the authors write that it was performed after

New evidence suggests the original experiment was also a form of theatre.</figure>
<p><em>By</em> <a href="http://www.psychologywriter.org.uk/">Christian Jarrett</a></p>
<p>What leads some people to tyrannise others, as when guards abuse their prisoners? The US psychologist Philip Zimbardo would say it’s the corrupting power of the situation. Infamously, in the summer of 1971, his prison simulation study had to be abandoned when some of the volunteers playing the role of guards began mistreating the volunteers acting as prisoners.</p>
<p>The shock value of the aborted study derives in large part from the idea that the mock prison took on a life of its own; that otherwise “ordinary” folk began behaving in abhorrent ways simply because they’d been assigned a role with particular connotations. As Zimbardo put it, the guards’ brutality occurred “as a natural consequence of being in the uniform of a ‘guard'”.</p>
<p>But not everyone buys this account. Critics of the Stanford Prison Experiment have long claimed that Zimbardo and his colleagues did not merely observe, but actively participated in the events that unfolded.</p>
<p>Now a team led by Alex Haslam at the University of Queensland has analysed a recently released recording of a conversation between one of the volunteer guards and Zimbardo’s collaborator David Jaffe, who acted as prison warden for the study. The findings of their analysis, <a href="https://psyarxiv.com/b7crx/">released as a pre-print at PsyArXiv</a>, suggest that one of psychology’s most famous studies was not so much an experiment but more a form of theatre. “We can no longer airbrush out the role of the experimenters in producing brutality,” write Haslam et al.</p>
<p><span id="more-34147"></span></p>
<p>The conversation, <a href="http://purl.stanford.edu/wn708sg0050">available for anyone to listen to online</a> (starts from 8.38), is 18-minutes long and features Jaffe attempting to persuade the “guard” John Mark to behave more like a stereotypical tough guard, a role he is clearly reluctant to take on.</p>
<p>Haslam and his colleagues analysed the interaction specifically looking for evidence of whether Jaffe engaged in “identity leadership”, which is characterised by the leader creating a shared sense of identity (a “them” and “us” mentality) and painting the required behavior of the in-group (the “us”) as worthy and virtuous and beneficial to the in-group.</p>
<p>The researchers found multiple examples of Jaffe engaging in precisely these kind of leadership tactics – for instance, he uses the collective “we” 57 times in the conversation (or once every 30 words); he argues that the entire endeavor will fall apart unless Mark and the other volunteer guards behave as required; and he portrays this shared endeavour as worthy, as a way to increase the chance of real-life prison reform.</p>
<p>Indisputably, Jaffe does not sit back and allow Mark to choose freely how to behave in his assigned role of guard: “… [W]e really want to get you active and involved because the Guards have to know that every Guard is going to be what we call a tough Guard,” he tells Mark.</p>
<p>The newly analysed recording, together with earlier video footage of Zimbardo acting as “prison superintendent” and briefing the guards on what was expected of them, contradict the way that Zimbardo has portrayed the experiment, as if the unsettling events unfolded by themselves. It seems more accurate to view the Stanford Prison Experiment as a compelling example of semi-scripted improvised theatre rather than as objective scientific research. Hopefully such an interpretation will find its way through to our introductory textbooks, <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2014/07/23/what-the-textbooks-dont-tell-you-one-of-psychologys-most-famous-experiments-was-seriously-flawed/">many of which present only Zimbardo’s account of what happened</a>.</p>
<p>But still, it remains the case that some of the volunteers assigned to the role of guards went way beyond the script, engaging in such cruel behaviour as forcing the “prisoners” to clean out toilets with their hands. How satisfactory is the social identity account that Haslam and his co-authors put forward as an explanation for why some of the guards resisted engaging in tyranny, while others willingly went way beyond Zimbardo and his colleagues’ expectations, not just acting tough, but engaging in depravity?</p>
<p>Haslam and his colleagues admit that to claim, on the basis of the new evidence, that identity leadership was responsible for the guards’ brutality “would be to go too far”.</p>
<p>Even while recognising the important influence of Zimbardo and his colleagues on the events that took place at Stanford (and why it was so persuasive), many will remain appalled by the sadism on display, and crave a deeper explanation for the darkness that resides within seemingly ordinary people. As science writer and sceptic Michael Shermer <a href="https://twitter.com/michaelshermer/status/1012005792164274177">wrote on Twitter</a> in response to these new findings and wider criticisms of the Stanford Prison Experiment, “The fact remains that the potential for evil lies in our nature given the right circumstances.”</p>

<img alt="" class="attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image" height="110" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2018/06/DSC_0714-e1530177552947-140x110.jpg" style="display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;" width="140" /><p>Universal health coverage (UHC) is a situation where every person irrespective of where they live and their socioeconomic status, have access to good quality health services without having to go through any financial hardship.</p>
<p>It has three key elements, namely: equity in access to healthcare in terms of geographic coverage and the range of available health services, health services which are of high quality, and financial protection against any hardship to users of health services which may be arise as a result of out-of-pocket payments.</p>
<p>UHC is central to the principles of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) of leaving no one behind. Its benefit goes beyond ensuring good health for populations; it also contributes to reduction in poverty, gender equity, social economic growth, and human capital development of any society.</p>
<blockquote><p>In my opinion, UHC is not a privilege but a right for all African citizens.</p></blockquote>
<p>In my opinion, UHC is not a privilege but a right for all African citizens. However, to many people, it may appear to be an ambitious target which would be difficult to achieve by many African countries.</p>
<p>Of course, as a public health physician with extensive working experience in Africa, I have witnessed first-hand the challenges in attaining UHC such as inadequate human resources for health, weak medicines supply chain management systems, inadequate and unsustainable financing of health services, and recurrent disasters which weakens health systems.</p>
<p>The high levels of poverty; poor status of the social; economic and environmental determinants of health; and the fact that a sizable majority of African citizens work in the informal sectors, making it difficult for them to participate in social protection and health insurance schemes, further compound the problem.</p>
<h3><strong>Achieving universal health coverage</strong></h3>
<p>Despite these challenges, I do strongly believe that attainment of UHC is a feasible aspiration which should be vigorously pursued by all African countries. The lessons learnt from implementation of the <a href="http://www.un.org/en/development/desa/policy/wess/wess_archive/2015wess_full_en.pdf">Millennium Development Goals (MDGs)</a> have shown that with strong political commitment and good governance, African countries could overcome the adversities which stand between them and UHC.</p>
<p>There are very good examples such as Rwanda; a country which was able to transform itself against all odds from the tragic events of 1994 to achieve all the health related MDGs. This enviable achievement was made possible by political commitment to health, good governance, accountable leadership, self-determination and use of innovations including a well acclaimed community-based health insurance program which covers more than 85% of its target population.</p>
<p>Similar but tailor-made methods could be used by other African countries to deploy innovative, cost-effective and context specific strategies and appropriate technologies to ensure sustainable financing of healthcare services, extension of health services to the populations which are underserved and to expand the range of health services.</p>
<blockquote><p>The call-to-action which was the final outcome of the forum called on African political leaders and public health policy makers to increase political commitment and domestic investments in health.</p></blockquote>
<p>It is therefore instructive that the first ever Africa Health Forum took place in Kigali Rwanda in June 2017. The forum in which I actively participated as an organizer and participant was convened to brainstorm on the key challenges and ways to fast track attainment of UHC in Africa and to galvanize commitment of African political leaders, civil society and the private sector to UHC and health SDG agenda.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://bmcproc.biomedcentral.com/articles/supplements/volume-12-supplement-7">report of the forum</a>, published in <em>BMC Proceedings</em>, provides insights into how UHC can be achieved in Africa. The participants and discussants at the forum proposed the use of evidence-based methods to advocate for sustainable domestic financing of health care services, institution of mandatory social protection and prepaid health insurance, and doubling of the efforts to generate good quality public health data.</p>
<p>The forum further identified increased private sector engagement in health services delivery and financing, strengthened partnerships, improved intersectoral collaborations and the use of south-south cooperation mechanisms as critical tools for fast tracking attainment of UHC on the continent.</p>
<p>The call-to-action which was the final outcome of the forum called on African political leaders and public health policy makers to increase political commitment and domestic investments in health and to fast track deployment of new technologies, including digital health solutions to support the attainment of UHC.</p>
<p>In conclusion, UHC should be viewed as a high yield investment which would ultimately translate into a healthier and productive population which will in turn transform Africa socioeconomically thus its attainment should not be negotiable. Looking forward, use of innovative approaches and evidence are needed to boost the attainment of UHC on the continent.</p>
