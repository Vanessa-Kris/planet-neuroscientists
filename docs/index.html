<p><i>By</i> <a href="https://emmayoung.net/">Emma Young</a></p>
<p>Juggling home and work commitments is <a href="https://99u.adobe.com/articles/31721/worklife-separation-is-impossible-heres-how-to-deal-with-it">never easy</a>, and yet there’s been surprisingly little research into how either demands – or support – at home or work may spillover into the other context. Does a frustrating or combative workday negatively affect family life that evening, for instance? Or if your partner is emotionally supportive when you both get home, will you “pass it on”, and be more supportive of colleagues the next day? And, are men and women affected in the same ways? A <a href="http://psycnet.apa.org/doiLanding?doi=10.1037/apl0000340">new paper</a>, published in the <i>Journal of Applied Psychology</i>, provides some provocative answers.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><span id="more-34482"></span></p>
<p>In the first of two studies conducted in the Netherlands, Lieke ten Brummelhuis at Simon Fraser University and Jeffrey Greenhaus at Drexel University asked both members of 26 heterosexual working couples, most of whom had children, and who had been together for an average of 17 years, to fill in questionnaires each day for five days.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Immediately after work, they answered questions about their emotional work demands and support that day – whether they’d been confronted with demanding clients or co-workers, for example, or whether a colleague had made time to listen to their problems.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Just before going to sleep, they then filled in another questionnaire, which asked about interactions at home after work. (They had to indicate how much they agreed or not with statements such as “Today, my family solved problems together”.) They also completed a brief survey that assessed both how much support they felt they’d received from their partner after work that day, and how much support they’d been able to offer their partner –<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>cheering them up, or listening while they talked about work problems, for instance.</p>
<p>The results showed some intriguing gender differences. On days when the men had heavier work demands, they admitted offering less support to their partners – and their partners backed this up,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>reporting they’d received less support, and that the quality of the family relationship was lower. But when the women had had a tough day at work, there was no impact on support or family life. What’s more, when the women reported receiving more emotional support from colleagues at work in the day, they also said that evening that they had offered their partners more support, and, supporting the honesty of these claims, their partners also reported that the quality of the family relationship was higher. This positive carry-over of support from work to the home did not occur with the men.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>To investigate what impacts home demands and emotional support – or lack of it – might have at work, the researchers then recruited 64 co-worker pairs for another five-day study. At the start of each day, all participants filled in a questionnaire that asked about home demands and support. Then, in the afternoon, they filled in another survey that asked about what support they’d offered their paired co-worker that day, and also about the quality of the team relationship.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>The researchers found a similar pattern of results to the first study: men with heavier home demands provided less emotional support to their co-worker, and team relationship quality was rated as lower by both members of the pair. For women, heavier home demands did not negatively affect the emotional support they were able to offer their co-worker – and, when they got more support at home, they offered more support at work, and the quality of the team relationship improved. Again, this positive association was not found for the men.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>As the researchers write, “Among women, we found only positive work-home processes in both directions, whereas among men, we found only negative work-home processes in both directions.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>This might be because, according to gender norms, women are expected to provide more emotional support and put more effort into maintaining relationships than men are, the researchers speculate. As they also note, equal roles for men and women are more valued in the Netherlands than in some other countries, such as the US. “It is possible that gender differences in a North American sample may be even more pronounced than in our studies,” they write.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>There are reasons to be cautious about some of the conclusions. Notably, the data on support provided and received and on relationship quality (at home and at work) was collected at the same time, so it’s impossible to be sure of the direction of the relationship. But as the researchers write, this short-term study does provide several leads for future research, which might explore the observed gender differences, and also whether there are strategies that might help to turn the negative processes observed in men into positive ones.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

On this blog I usually focus on academic, scientific neuroscience. However, there is a big world outside the laboratory and, in the real world, the concepts of neuroscience are being used (and abused) in ways that would make any honest neuroscientist blush.



In this post I'm going to focus on three recent examples of neuro-products: commercial products that are promoted as having some kind of neuroscience-based benefit.

                <h4><a href="http://brainblogger.com/2018/08/13/friendship-bench-a-model-for-accessible-mental-health-care/">Friendship Bench—A Model for Accessible Mental Health Care</a></h4>

<p></p>
<p>In 2017, Mental Health America reported that one in five adults with mental illness say that they are not receiving the mental health care that they need. (Mental Health America, 2017) The reasons for this are the following:</p>
<li>
<ul>(1) they do not have <a href="http://brainblogger.com/2006/03/05/roundtable-what-can-science-do-to-promote-parity-between-mental-and-physical-health-in-the-insurance-industry/">insurance</a> for it</ul>
<ul>(2) they do not have enough money to pay for the service</ul>
<ul>(3) mental health care providers are lacking</ul>
</li>
<p>There is one mental health care provider for every 529 individuals in the US. This gap widens significantly for specialized mental health care. Only 20% of children with mental health problems receive some form of mental health services. The reason is that there are only about 8000 child and adolescent psychiatrists practicing in the US. In San Francisco alone, the Center for Disease Controls and Prevention (CDC) reports that there are about 32 child psychiatrists and 88 child psychologists per 10,000 children ages 0 to 17 years old.</p>
<p>There is a need for re-imagining the delivery of mental health care. One such method is known as the <em>Friendship Bench Intervention</em> (see video). The friendship bench has been undergoing development for more than 20 years in Harare, Zimbabwe where the Harare City Health Department in collaboration with the University of Zimbabwe Medical School sought to solve a major cause of disability from non-communicable diseases in the region, mostly common mental disorders such as <a href="http://brainblogger.com/2018/06/11/does-depression-accelerate-aging/">depression</a> and <a href="http://brainblogger.com/2009/01/06/recent-drug-warnings-about-suicide/">suicidal ideation</a>.</p>
<p>The <em>Friendship Bench </em>is a task-shifted brief intervention and problem-solving therapy for common mental disorders which is provided by female lay health workers trained in specific aspects of <a href="http://brainblogger.com/2012/06/05/the-cognitive-behavioral-miracle-controlling-your-emotions/">cognitive behavioral therapy</a>, particularly in problem-solving therapy and behavior scheduling. </p>
<p>In short, the <em>Friendship Bench</em> mitigates common mental disorders such as depression by utilizing female lay health workers who are trained and supervised by clinical psychologists and psychiatrists to perform problem-solving therapy in a primary care setting.</p>
<p>The problem-solving approach starts with the patient identifying the cause of his mental illness. For example, <a href="http://brainblogger.com/2011/12/21/hard-economic-times-and-increased-suicide/">unemployment</a>. Interestingly, this approach deviates from the conventional where experts aim at diagnosing the patient from the symptoms that they present. Problem-solving therapy aims to provide a positive orientation of the patient towards resolving these identified<em> problems</em>. This makes them realize that they can have control in overcoming their mental illness.</p>
<p>The lay workers follow a script and conduct 6 sessions lasting from 30 to 45 minutes for each patient. The first session involves three components: (1) <em>Opening the Mind </em>or <em>kuvhura pfungwa</em>, (2) <em>Uplifting </em>or <em>kusimudzira</em>, and (3) <em>Strengthening </em>or <em>kusimbisa</em>. The first session aims to let the patient open their mind and identify their problems. They would then be allowed to choose only one to work on. The lay worker and the patient will then identify how to solve this problem realistically and formulate an action plan. This is an iterative process where the subsequent sessions will develop based on the first session.</p>
<p>Common mental health disorders that the <em>Friendship Bench</em> aims to treat are the following: <a href="http://brainblogger.com/2018/01/10/tryptophan-in-mood-anxiety-and-depression/">depression</a>, <a href="http://brainblogger.com/2018/05/25/how-misreading-bodily-signals-causes-anxiety/">anxiety</a>, panic disorder, <a href="http://brainblogger.com/2015/01/24/how-does-post-traumatic-stress-disorder-change-the-brain/">post-traumatic stress disorder</a>, cognitive disorders, and <a href="http://brainblogger.com/2018/02/06/the-future-of-healing-addiction-holistic-tech-assisted-rehabilitation/">substance abuse</a>.</p>
<p>Hiring and training lay workers from the community can significantly increase the mental health workforce. The requirement for the adult female trainees in this program is an educational background with at least 8 years of formal schooling (secondary schooling may suffice). The average age of the trainees is 58-years old. The training can be easily implemented, and it is cost-efficient at only $200 per health worker.</p>

<p>Community engagement is a key process in the development of the <em>Friendship Bench</em>. The goal is to bring community members, experts, researchers, and other key stakeholders together and become equal partners in the program. They engage in a workshop to develop a theory-driven framework known as the <em>Theory of Change</em>. Members hypothesize the best treatment initiative plan for the community’s patients and form a theory of “<em>how and why an initiative works?</em>”. Variables are identified and constantly measured for every cause and effect pathway. This illustrates proof that an initiative has a positive or negative impact. The theories are continuously measured, challenged, and changed until the desired impact is formulated (see Figure 1).</p>
<p>The success of the program is heavily reliant on the training method, the translation of the manual to the local language, and the integration of the program with the culture of the community. Lay workers must also learn how to translate and utilize tools used in common mental disorders such as the 20 item Self-Reporting Questionnaire (SRQ-20), General Health Questionnaire (GHQ-12), Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS-D), and Patient Health Questionnaire – 9 Depression Test (PHQ-9). These are the basic metrics used to determine if the therapies are working.</p>
<p>Adding to the workforce, competent lay mental health workers in the primary care setting can offset the gap in mental healthcare delivery in communities. Its success in first-world countries is more likely because its growth can be sustained by leveraging readily accessible financial resources allocated each year by public health organizations. Its robust infrastructure, particularly in primary care clinics and information technology such as <a href="http://brainblogger.com/2009/09/13/logging-on-for-psychotherapy/">telehealth services</a>, can boost the <em>Friendship Bench </em>programs. A limitation of the <em>Friendship</em> <em>Bench</em> is that it is designed to treat adult common mental disorders. To emulate this program so that it can suit the need for pediatric mental health disorders is of importance.</p>

<p>The structured nature of Cognitive Behavioural Therapy/CBT and its clearly defined principles (based on the links between thoughts, feelings and behaviours) make it relatively easy to train practitioners, to ensure standardised delivery and to measure outcomes. Consequently, CBT has revolutionised mental health care, allowing psychologists to alchemize therapy from an art into a science. For many mental health conditions, there is now considerable evidence that CBT is as, or more, effective than drug treatments. Yet, just like any form of psychotherapy, CBT is not without the risk of unwanted adverse effects.</p>
<p>A recent <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs10608-018-9904-y">paper</a> in <em>Cognitive Therapy and Research</em> outlines the nature and prevalence of these unwanted effects, based on structured interviews with 100 CBT-trained psychotherapists. “This is what therapists should know about when informing their patients about the upcoming merits and risks of treatment,” write Marie-Luise Schermuly-Haupt and her colleagues.</p>
<p><span id="more-34469"></span></p>
<p>The researchers asked each CBT-therapist (78 per cent were female, average age 32, with an average of 5 years experience) to recall their most recent client who had taken part in at least 10 sessions of CBT. The chosen clients (51 per cent were female, average age 38) mostly had diagnoses of depression, anxiety or personality disorder, in the mild to moderate range.</p>
<p>The interviewer – an experienced clinical psychologist trained in CBT – followed the Unwanted Events-Adverse Treatment Reactions checklist, asking each therapist whether their client had experienced any of 17 possible unwanted effects from therapy, such deterioration, new symptoms, distress, strains in family relations, or stigma.</p>
<p>The therapists, who work at outpatient clinics in Germany, reported an average of 3.7 unwanted events per client. Based on the therapists’ descriptions, the interviewer then rated the likelihood of each unwanted event being directly attributable to the therapeutic process – making them a true side-effect (only those rated as “definitely related to treatment” were categorised as such).</p>
<p>Following this process, the researchers estimated that 43 per cent of clients had experienced at least one unwanted side-effect from CBT, equating to an average of .57 per client (one client had four, the maximum allowed by the research methodology): most often distress, deterioration and strains in family relations. Over 40 per cent of side-effects were rated as severe or very severe, and over 25 per cent lasted weeks or months, though the majority were mild or moderate and transient. “Psychotherapy is not harmless,” the researchers said. There was no evidence that any of the side-effects were due to unethical practice.</p>
<p>Examples of severe side-effects included: “suicidality, breakups, negative feedback from family members, withdrawal from relatives, feelings of shame or guilt, or intensive crying and emotional disturbance during sessions.”</p>
<p>Such effects are not so surprising when you consider that CBT can involve exposure therapy (i.e. gradual exposure to situations that provoke anxiety); discussing and focusing on one’s problems; reflecting on the sources of one’s stress, such as difficult relationships; frustration at lack of progress; and feelings of growing dependency on a therapist’s support.</p>
<p>The longer that a client had been in therapy, the more likely they were to have experienced one or more side-effects. Also, and against expectations, clients with milder symptoms were more likely to experience side-effects, perhaps because more serious symptoms mask such effects.</p>
<p>Interestingly, before the structured interviews, the therapists were asked off the top of their heads whether they felt their client had had any unwanted effects – in this case 74 per cent said they had not. Often it was only when prompted to think through the different examples of potential side-effects that they became aware of their prevalence. This chimes with <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2014/07/28/the-mistakes-that-lead-therapists-to-infer-psychotherapy-was-effective-when-it-wasnt/">earlier research</a> that’s documented the biases that can lead therapists to believe therapy has been successful when it hasn’t.</p>
<p>Schermuly-Haupt and her colleagues said a conundrum raised by their findings was whether unpleasant reactions that may be an unavoidable aspect of the therapeutic process should be considered side-effects. “We argue that they are side-effects although they may be unavoidable, justified, or even needed and intended.,” they said. “If there were an equally effective treatment that did not promote anxiety in the patient, the present form of exposure treatment would become unethical as it is a burden to the patient.”</p>
<p>There are reasons to treat the new findings with caution: the results depended on the therapists’ recall (an in-the-moment or diary-based methodology could overcome this problem), and about half the clients were also on psychoactive medication, so it’s possible some adverse effects could be attributable to the drugs rather than the therapy (even though this was not the interviewer’s judgment, and remember the researchers used a conservative estimate of side-effects, only considering those that were “definitely” related to therapy by their estimation, and ignoring those that they considered “rather” or “most probably” related).</p>
<p>The researchers concluded that “An awareness and recognition of unwanted events and side effects in all therapies will benefit patients, improve therapy or reduce attrition, analogous to the benefit of measurement-based monitoring of treatment progress.”</p>

They're interested in cell types, circuit diagrams, and monitoring and manipulating neural activity in model organisms such as Drosophila, zebrafish, and mice.

You'll get different answers depending on who you ask. We know that “individual neuroscientists have chosen to work at specific spatial scales, ranging from .. ion channels ... to systems level” and we know there is a range of temporal scales, “from the millisecond of synaptic firing to the entire lifespan” (<a href="http://www.jneurosci.org/content/early/2018/06/19/JNEUROSCI.3174-17.2018.abstract">Koroshetz et al., 2018)</a>:<br /><blockquote class="tr_bq">Within this diverse set of scales, the circuit is a key point of focus for two primary reasons: <b><span style="color: #cc0000;">(1) neural circuits perform the calculations necessary to produce behavior</span></b>; and (2) dysfunction at the level of the circuit is the basis of disability in many neurological and psychiatric disorders.</blockquote><br />So maybe key point #1 is a generic working definition of a neural circuit, and is the focus of many NIH BRAIN-funded neuroscientists. But there's a huge leap from the <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4465370/" target="_blank" title="Integrated circuits and molecular components for stress and feeding: implications for eating disorders.">impressive work</a> on e.g. mapping, manipulating, and controlling stress-related feeding behaviors in rodents, and key point #2: isolating circuit dysfunction and ultimately treating eating disorders in humans. There is a lot of “promise” and many “aspirational goals”, but the concluding sentence is just too aspirational and promises too much:<br /><blockquote class="tr_bq">With diverse scientists jointly working in novel team structures, often in partnership with industry, and sharing unprecedented types and quantities of data, the BRAIN Initiative offers a unique opportunity to open the door to a golden age in brain science and <span style="color: #cc0000;"><b>improved brain health for all</b></span>.</blockquote><br />The research that gets closest to bridging this gap is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrocorticography" target="_blank">electocorticography</a> (ECoG) and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_brain_stimulation">deep brain stimulation</a> (DBS) in human patients.<span style="color: purple;"><b><sup>1</sup> </b></span>The exemplar cited in the NIH paper is by <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6021210/" target="_blank">Swann et al.

The project was supported by the INCF organisation and my mentor, Padraig Gleeson, and I had 3 months to shape and bring to life all the ideas that we had in our heads. This blog post summarises the core motivation of the project, the technical challenges, what I have done, and future steps.</span><br /><span><br /></span><span><span id="docs-internal-guid-2b42ffb6-7fff-9f82-bb90-62c669712720"><span style="font-size: 16pt; vertical-align: baseline;">Background</span></span></span><br /><span>NeuroML version 2 and LEMS were introduced in order to standardise the description of neuroscience computational models and facilitate the shareability of results among different research groups</span><span>1</span><span>. However, so far, NeuroML2/LEMS have focused on modelling spiking neurons and how information is exchanged between them in networks. With the introduction of neural mass models, NeuroML2/LEMS can be extended to study interactions between large-scale systems such as cortical regions and indeed whole brain dynamics. To achieve this, my project consisted of implementing the basic structures needed in NeuroML2/LEMS to simulate Neural Mass Models and compare the results with previously published papers. </span><br /><span><br /></span><span>What I did</span><br /><span>During the project I focused on the implementation of three previously described Neural Mass Models into NeuroML2/LEMS:</span><br /><span><br /><span style="font-size: 11pt; vertical-align: baseline;">1. </span><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-weight: 700; vertical-align: baseline;">del Molino et al., 2017</span><span style="color: #2c3f51; font-size: 6.6pt; vertical-align: super;">2</span><span style="font-size: 11pt; vertical-align: baseline;">: This study analyses the dynamics and interaction between excitatory neurons and three types of interneurons (parvalbumin (PV), somatostatin (SST) and vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) expressing).  It first looks at the interactions between single units representing each population and then it scales up to analyse the interaction between a network with multiple interacting units in each population.

<p>"Subscriptions are a great way to draw a steady stream of revenue from readers — unless readers share their login credentials with everyone they know. As publishers try to grow subscription businesses, they have to figure out how to handle password-sharing, a phenomenon that subscription services like Netflix and Spotify have wrestled with for years. On one hand, subscribers are often the most enthusiastic members of a publisher’s audience, and limiting access cuts into their ability to proselytize. But allowing flagrant password-sharing disincentivizes would-be subscribers, and it’s hard to limit it without aggravating your users. Password-sharing is a well-documented problem for subscription content companies, particularly in digital video. Reuters/Ipsos research released last summer found that more than one-fifth of 18- to 24-year-olds had used a login from somebody outside their household to stream content; overall, 12 percent of adults said they’d done so...."</p>

<p>Notwithstanding the value that SNSs offer users, there is growing evidence to suggest that some users engage with SNSs in maladaptive ways, potentially resulting in new, or exacerbating existing, psychological problems. In our <a href="https://bmcpsychology.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s40359-018-0245-0?utm_source=BMC_blog&amp;utm_medium=Blog&amp;utm_content=DavFal-BMC-BMC_Psychology-Psychiatry/Psychology-Global&amp;utm_campaign=BMCS_USG_AUG2018_Facebook_use">study recently published in <em>BMC Psychology</em></a>, we set out to understand problematic social networking use more clearly, focusing specifically on the use of the popular SNS, Facebook, and its association with social attachment. Specifically, we explored four forms of problematic Facebook use.</p>
<ol>
<li>‘Impression management’ whereby an individual conveys an ideal (false) self, that suggests, for example, that they are in the perfect intimate relationship</li>
<li>‘Intrusive Facebook use’ whereby time spent on the platform intrudes on one’s daily life by limiting the quality of time alone or with others</li>
<li>‘Problematic self-disclosure’ by divulging personal problems, potentially impulsively, and in a moment of vulnerability</li>
<li>‘Social comparison’ whereby an individual uses Facebook to compare themselves to others</li>

<p>A wealth of recent studies indicate that using Facebook in these ways is linked to <a href="http://www5.csudh.edu/psych/Is_Facebook_Creating__iDisorders__The_Link_Between_Clinical_Symptoms_of_Psychiatric_Disorders_and_Technology_Use,_Attitudes_and_Anxiety-2013-Computers_in_Human_Behavior_Rosen_Whaling_Rab_Carrier_Cheever.pdf">low mood and low self-esteem</a> in some users of the site. Therefore one important question is “What is driving certain people to use Facebook in these problematic ways?” One possibility is differences in social attachment.</p>
<h3></h3>
<h3><strong>Social attachment</strong></h3>
<p>Attachment behaviors that an adult engages in are influenced in large part by the quality of their attachment relationship with their primary caregiver(s). Adult attachment is typically considered to exist along two continuums – attachment anxiety and attachment avoidance.</p>
<p>Attachment anxiety is thought to be related to a history of inconsistent caregiving experiences, in which the caregiver was at times sensitive to the infant’s needs, and at other times non-responsive. High levels of attachment anxiety in adulthood are associated with emotional lability, increased dependency, and preoccupation with the availability of others, as these individuals strive to keep people close.</p>
<img alt="Pexels" class="size-medium wp-image-10427 alignleft" height="202" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2018/08/Facebook-phone-300x202.jpg" width="300" />
<p>Attachment avoidance on the other hand, has been linked to early interactions in which the primary caregiver was unresponsive to the needs of the infant and was emotionally unavailable when the infant showed signs of dependence. In adulthood, high levels of attachment avoidance manifests in resisting intimacy, inhibiting emotional expression, and a having a strong sense of independence, while also striving to remain connected to the people in their lives.</p>
<p>Given Facebook’s highly social platform, we wondered whether people with high levels of attachment insecurity would be motivated to use Facebook in unhelpful ways as a means of connecting with others. Given the tendency for human attachment systems to become activated during times of stress, we predicted that psychological distress and low self-esteem would mediate the relationship between adult attachment and problematic Facebook use.</p>
<h3><strong>Attachment’s impact on problematic Facebook use</strong></h3>
<blockquote><p>We found that those people with high levels of attachment anxiety and low self-esteem, engaged in all four problematic Facebook behaviors when feeling distressed.</p></blockquote>
<p>In our study, 717 adult Facebook users completed a host of online questionnaires pertaining to psychological distress, self-esteem, attachment, and Facebook use. We found that those people with high levels of attachment anxiety and low self-esteem, engaged in all four problematic Facebook behaviors when feeling distressed.</p>
<p>Engaging in social comparison as a route to self-enhancement, portraying an idealized self that may be attractive to others, disclosing personal information, and using the site intrusively were considered to be motivated by a desire to elicit contact and connection from others online.</p>
<p>We also found that when distressed, those people with high levels of attachment avoidance and low self-esteem, engaged in impression management and intrusive Facebook use that impacted their social relationships offline. This too is understandable when considering that Facebook is likely to offer a less threatening forum within which to have one’s attachment needs met, for those who shirk intimacy in their offline relationships.</p>
<p>These findings are important for users of Facebook for several reasons. Most importantly, learning about the patterns of Facebook use that are linked to negative outcomes such as low mood and depression, may alert people to be more mindful of the ways in which they engage with social media platforms. It can also help mental health professionals assess risk factors for problematic on-line social networking.</p>
<p>We suggest that our four problematic Facebook behaviors can resemble maladaptive attachment behaviors, used to maintain close social connections. While those high in attachment insecurity may derive some comfort and relief from using Facebook in these ways, these positive benefits may be short-lived. Use of Facebook in these ways may potentially maintain or lead to further distress and low self-esteem since Facebook, and other SNSs are poor substitutes for real-world, bi-directional, and supportive social relationships.</p>

<p>Especially if you are in a long-term relationship your own sexual functioning is not a purely an individual matter but is bound up with your partner’s. Previous research has looked at this dynamic, finding for example that people are generally happier with their sex lives when they have the perception that they and their partner are sexually compatible. Surprisingly, however, before now the influence of your partner’s broader personality traits on your own sex life had not been studied.</p>
<p>A German study of nearly a thousand long-term couples (98 per cent of them heterosexual) is the first to look at this question. Among the stand-out findings is that, for women, having a more conscientious partner was associated with having better sexual functioning and a more satisfactory sex life.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30028211">Writing in The Journal of Sex Research</a>, the researchers, led by Julia Velten at Ruhr-Universität Bochum, suggested that “men who are thorough and dutiful may feel the need to satisfy their partner sexually, which may in turn lead to better sexual function of their partners.”</p>
<p><span id="more-34477"></span></p>
<p>The researchers interviewed each participant and his or her partner individually over the phone about their personality traits; their sexual responsiveness (that is, how easily aroused or easily turned off they are, which psychologists consider stable traits and refer to as “sexual excitation” and “sexual inhibition”); and finally, in detail, about their sexual function. For women this last measure incorporated sexual satisfaction, arousal, desire, lubrication, pain, and orgasm frequency; for men it was focused on erectile function but also included questions about desire, satisfaction and orgasm.</p>
<p>The participants had an average age of 51 and had been in their current relationships for an average of 24 years.</p>
<p>Consistent with past research, the female and male participants’ own traits were relevant to their sexual function. For both sexes, and to no great surprise, being more easily sexily aroused and less easily turned off (for example by stress at work or performance anxieties) were associated with healthier sexual function.</p>
<p>In terms of their own personality traits, only the participants’ own higher levels of conscientiousness (a trait that incorporates self-discipline, orderliness and ambition) were correlated with healthier sexual function – perhaps because people high in this trait put more effort into their sex lives.</p>
<p>Surprisingly, given past research suggesting that extraverts have more active and enjoyable sex lives (and the same for people higher in openness-to-experience), the participants’ own scores on these traits were not related to their sexual function, perhaps because they overlapped so much with the measures of sexual excitation and inhibition that were included in the statistical analysis.</p>
<p>More novel and interesting are the effects on participants of their partners’ traits. Men who were easily aroused benefited sexually if their partner was disposed the same way. “In men who are easily aroused by erotic fantasies or visual stimuli, having a partner who responds in a similar way may facilitate sexual function,” the researchers said.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, for women, having a partner prone to greater sexual inhibition was associated with their own sexual function being poorer. “Especially in couples who limit their sexual interactions to penile-vaginal intercourse, women whose partners are more sexually inhibited … may experience fewer sexual interactions that provide enough stimulation,” the researchers said.</p>
<p>In terms of partners’ personality traits – the key trait for women, as mentioned above, was their partner’s conscientiousness – women with more conscientious partners tended to report their own sexual function to be healthier. “Conscientious individuals might have the tendency ‘not to let it slip’ and to continue working on the sexual relationships with their partners,” the researchers said.</p>
<p>Also relevant for women was their partner’s agreeability – those with <em>less</em> agreeable partners reported healthier sexual function. Meanwhile, men reported healthier sexual function when their partners scored higher in emotional <em>in</em>stability. We await explanations for these particular associations.</p>
<p>Outside of individual traits, men’s age was, unsurprisingly, negatively correlated with their sexual function scores. However, across the couples, relationship duration was not correlated with participants’ sexual function. “This finding implies that a healthy sexual life is possible even in long relationships,” the researchers said.</p>
<p>Among the study’s limitations is that shy couples or couples with greater relationship problems are less likely to have agreed to take part. Also, the results only present a static picture of the dynamics between the measured variables – we don’t know how they are causally related to each other. Nonetheless, this study breaks new ground by uncovering the ways that our partner’s personality might have an influence on our own sexual function.</p>
<p>“Improving our knowledge about intra- and inter-personal factors contributing to sexual concerns is valuable to further develop psychological treatments for individuals and couples who are distressed by low sexual function,” the researchers said.</p>

<h4>You don’t need a neuroscience background, and it might even help if you don’t. You do, however, need research experience.</h4><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*8TEOr5iqhtR6arYk3s-YDQ.jpeg" />Wrangle your studies before Catwoman steals your books. (Photo: Ashley Juavinett)</figure><p>You’ve given it <a href="https://medium.com/@ashleyjthinks/why-you-should-or-shouldnt-get-a-phd-in-neuroscience-cdb4daf6a248">some thought</a>, and a neuroscience PhD could be in your future. So, what do you need to get there?</p><h4>Undergraduate degrees before the PhD</h4><p>In theory, you could come from almost any academic background before coming into neuroscience, as long as you also have research experience (see below). According to a recent Society for Neuroscience report, most students who matriculate into Ph.D. programs in the U.S. have degrees in neuroscience, biology, or psychology. However, a huge chunk of applicants also come from chemistry and mathematics, and many students come in with dual degrees (see <a href="https://www.sfn.org/careers-and-training/faculty-and-curriculum-tools/training-program-surveys">SfN 2016</a> for more details).</p><p>I was curious about the broader population of neuroscientists beyond those currently enrolled in PhD programs, so I conducted a Twitter survey:</p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-align="center" data-conversation="none" data-dnt="true"><p>Ye who do neuroscience research* (or who have in the past), what was your undergraduate major? Leave a reply if it's not listed! *self-defined</p><p> — <a href="https://twitter.com/analog_ashley/status/1021736834324471808">@analog_ashley</a></p></blockquote><p>Many, many people had write-in responses. When we pull together all of the responses (<em>n</em>=950), here’s what the breakdown looks like:</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/583/1*QCNe0vq6P7CcuV9i5LbTWg.png" /></figure><p>There were a host of other undergraduate degrees ranging from biotechnology to animal behavior to economics (okay, isn’t that just very advanced animal behavior?) with one or two folks claiming them. They’re not included in the graph for simplicity, but the full dataset is <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1q1PR8nGAn1C_tHuMG5T2rcvKDDzllHicoB-7s-Hic8Q/edit?usp=sharing">here</a>. Not surprisingly, the answers for computational neuroscientists were <a href="https://twitter.com/neurograce/status/1021739964743213059">slightly different</a>.</p><p>Among the list, there were a few fun answers. Neuroscientist and Journal of Neuroscience Editor-in-Chief Marina Piciotto was a <a href="https://twitter.com/MarinaP63/status/1022096460299558912">Biology &amp; English major</a>. Famed neuroscientist David Eagleman also had a surprising answer: <a href="https://twitter.com/davideagleman/status/1021969629634211840">British &amp; American Literature</a>. “No joke,” he added.</p><p>In summary, neuroscientists come from a wide range of backgrounds, and you shouldn’t feel like there’s only <em>one </em>path into a career of neuroscience. Neuroscience is a wonderfully diverse field that touches on almost every other discipline — after all, it is fundamentally the study of how brains (and their owners) interact with the world. Our field is better off with perspectives from every intellectual angle, as well as with people who have thought deeply about very specific subfields.</p><h4>How competitive is it?</h4><p>Regardless of your undergraduate major, you should be at the top of your game academically. Neuroscience programs in the U.S. receive anywhere between 5 and 875 program applicants — <a href="https://www.sfn.org/-/media/SfN/Documents/Survey-Reports/NDP-Final-Report.ashx?la=en&amp;hash=41FEFFA45C371F27648DF48DB0A11E46A19171E0">170 on average</a>. For the academic year 2016–2017, the average acceptance rate for U.S. PhD programs was <a href="https://www.sfn.org/-/media/SfN/Documents/Survey-Reports/NDP-Final-Report.ashx?la=en&amp;hash=41FEFFA45C371F27648DF48DB0A11E46A19171E0">19%</a>. Although there’s more applicants, most programs <a href="https://www.sfn.org/-/media/SfN/Documents/Survey-Reports/NDP-Final-Report.ashx?la=en&amp;hash=41FEFFA45C371F27648DF48DB0A11E46A19171E0">report</a> that they’re accepting the same number of students, largely because of limited funding from training grants and space in faculty labs. So, it does seem to be getting more competitive, and it’s not clear that more positions for graduate students are going to be opening soon.</p><h4>What are admissions committees looking for?</h4><p>Most graduate programs will evaluate you on three main categories: your research experience, your GPA (grade point average from college), and your GRE scores (Graduate Record Examinations, a commonly required standardized test in the U.S.). The relative weight of those attributes will vary between school to school, and even depends on the members on the admissions committee. Some schools will set hard cutoffs for the numerical categories there, but they’re typically not disclosive about it. <a href="https://www.sfn.org/-/media/SfN/Documents/Survey-Reports/NDP-Final-Report.ashx?la=en&amp;hash=41FEFFA45C371F27648DF48DB0A11E46A19171E0">Applicants in 2016 </a>had an average undergraduate GPA of 3.56, and average verbal as well as quantitative GRE scores of 158.</p><p>Your best bet is to do as best as you can in those three categories. Of course, if you’re out of college, it’s hard to go back and change your GPA. If you have a low GPA and GRE scores, the best way to improve your chances of getting into graduate school is by spending some time working in a lab.</p><h4>Research experience before graduate school</h4><p>While there isn’t usually a strict requirement for research experience, a striking <a href="https://www.sfn.org/-/media/SfN/Documents/Survey-Reports/NDP-Final-Report.ashx?la=en&amp;hash=41FEFFA45C371F27648DF48DB0A11E46A19171E0">98% of applicants</a> to U.S. PhD programs have at least some previous experience working in lab. Still, you should get some research experience for more than just getting into PhD programs— you should have research experience so that you have insight into whether or not you like doing research.</p><p>Your research experience could be in one lab for a long time, or short bursts in other labs. If you’re at a college that doesn’t have a ton of research, there are many summer research programs out there. I found it really informative to find research experiences beyond the brick walls of my small liberal arts school. Many summer programs are also specifically for underrepresented minorities, and most of them will pay you a stipend as well as cover room and board.</p><p>My personal advice is this: Take the courses that keep you engaged and motivate you to learn. If your gut homunculus pulls you into cognitive science, follow that. If you find molecular models dreamy, by all means, <em>build them all. </em>Put in the time and effort to do well on your GREs. Apply to many summer research programs, either at your home institution or beyond. You’ll excel when it becomes less about grades and more about the mysteries that the brain refuses to simply roll out on a red carpet for us. And ultimately, that’s what being a neuroscientist is about, anyway.</p><h4>This post is the beginning of a conversation</h4><p>This piece is part of a series that will eventually morph into a book, tentatively titled “<em>So you want to be a neuroscientist? An honest account of life as a researcher” (Columbia University Press). </em>The goal is to offer aspiring neuroscientists honest, informative insight about our field as well as education and careers in it. Most importantly, it will reflect the opinions and experience of our entire community — so, I’d greatly appreciate your feedback. What did I miss? What do you disagree with?</p><img height="1" src="https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&amp;referrerSource=full_rss&amp;postId=6a0bb4ee5275" width="1" /><hr /><p><a href="https://medium.com/the-spike/preparing-for-a-neuroscience-phd-6a0bb4ee5275">Preparing for a neuroscience PhD</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/the-spike">The Spike</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<h3>Falling Through the Cracks in Pain Management</h3>
<h4>Pain and Opioids</h4>
<p>Chronic pain is debilitating, and it can cause patients to “<em>fall through the cracks</em>”. Health care institutions struggle to find ways to create “<em>nets</em>” and catch these patients. Pain medications include <a href="http://brainblogger.com/2015/01/30/opioids-for-chronic-pain-an-interview-with-dr-webster-pain-guru/">opioids which are used to treat chronic pain.</a> Opioids often fail to treat the patient’s primary medical condition. As time goes by, patients tend to be unsatisfied with the results.</p>
<p>Also, there is a good chance that some of these types of pain medications will be abused. In fact, pain medicines such as opioids are part of the United States opioid crisis. According to the Centers for Disease Control (CDC), every day, more than 115 people in the United States die after overdosing on opioids. (CDC/NCHS, 2017) The opioids include prescription drugs, including fentanyl, and synthetic street drugs such as heroin.</p>
<p>It is estimated that the total economic burden of prescription opioid misuse in the United States is $78.5 billion a year which includes the costs in health care, lost productivity, addiction therapy, and criminal justice involvement. (Florence, Zhou, Lou, &amp; Xu, 2013)</p>
<h4>Pain and Mindfulness Meditation</h4>
<blockquote><p>To overcome pain, another task which demands higher controlled attention must be pitted against it.</p></blockquote>
<p>Other forms of therapies were introduced to <a href="http://brainblogger.com/2008/03/16/chronic-pain-and-the-brain/">manage chronic pain</a>.</p>
<p>One such therapy is known as <a href="http://brainblogger.com/2016/05/01/mind-over-matter-mindfulness-meditation-for-pain-management/">mindfulness meditation</a>. Mindfulness meditation is: “the intentional self-regulation of attention from moment to moment”. (Goleman &amp; Schwartz, 1876) This method has been used for quite some time. A study done in mindfulness meditation by Dr. Kabat-Zinn has reported that 65% of patients have exhibited a reduction of pain by more than 33% and about 50% of patients have reported a reduction of pain by 50% over a 10-week period of therapy. (Kabat-Zinn, 1982)</p>
<p>Some studies performed in mindfulness meditation have reported patients with strong feelings of anger towards their pain condition while others report some anxiety while undergoing mindfulness therapy. la Cour and Petersen point out that meditation therapy requires a learning curve for the patient to access the more important personal “<em>inner space</em>”. (la Cour &amp; Petersen, 2015) This can be an exciting learning experience of discovery for some patients while other patients may see this as a constant battle that in itself can be a painful experience.</p>
<p>The next question to consider therefore is to find out which patients benefits the most from mindfulness meditation and which are not, and then find out what other therapies we can use in these patients.</p>
<h3>Enter Virtual Reality: Pain and Attention</h3>
<p>Recall a recent injury. Ever wonder why after a trauma or injury has occurred, there seems to be a delay in which actual pain is produced? Pain has to first gain access to consciousness and demands central attentional resources by interrupting all other current brain processes such as worry, fear, or desire. It does so easily because of its noxious nature. (Eccleston, 1995) Pain, therefore, can be considered as a controlled task. To overcome pain, another task which demands higher controlled attention must be pitted against it.</p>
<p>The characteristics of pain such as intensity, quality, and/or pattern affect the probability of capturing attention. In chronic pain, for example, the characteristics of the pain and its intensity are important for pain processing. This may explain the reason why there are “<em>good</em>” days and “<em>bad</em>” days for patients with sciatica, <a href="http://brainblogger.com/2014/09/13/how-temperature-affects-people-with-multiple-sclerosis/">multiple sclerosis</a>, and other causes of chronic pain. Persistent pains with unpredictable sensory qualities that fluctuate in intensities are more likely to be processed. (Eccleston, 1995)</p>
<p>Finding the perfect distractor with the ability to interrupt persistent pain stimulus processing is key to coping. <a href="http://brainblogger.com/2008/07/19/virtual-reality-new-steps-in-stroke-rehabilitation/">Virtual reality</a> (VR) systems offer computer-generated sensory inputs that involve sight, sound, and touch. These inputs make it essentially difficult for the brain to ignore especially if the VR program is immersive. Immersive VR is an experience that gives a perfect illusion to the patient that is in the virtual world. The strength of the illusion of the presence of the virtual world reflects the amount of attention drawn into the virtual environment. (Hoffman, Doctor, Patterson, Carrougher, &amp; Furness III, 2000)</p>
<p>Virtual reality may not replace the conventional pain management anytime soon. Once the patient comes out of VR, they will soon feel pain once more. Pharmacologic therapy remains the mainstay of pain management. But the problem of using pharmacologic treatment for pain remains a challenge. Undermedication is a problem of pain management failure. But higher doses of opioids poses a serious risk such as respiratory failure and encephalopathy. Therefore, the application of pain relief using VR may be for the use of procedural pain management such as minor surgical procedures, wound cleaning and debridement, and escharotomy in burn victims.</p>

<p><em>By guest blogger</em> <a href="http://www.davidrobson.me/">David Robson</a></p>
<p>Take a moment to consider how old you feel. Not your actual, biological age – but your own subjective feelings.</p>
<p>Abundant research during the past few decades has shown that this “subjective age” can be a powerful predictor of your health, including the risk of <a href="https://academic.oup.com/psychsocgerontology/advance-article-abstract/doi/10.1093/geronb/gby006/4838941?redirectedFrom=PDF">depression</a>, <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17986588">diabetes and hypertension</a>, <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022395617310233">dementia</a>, and hospitalisation for illness and injury, and <a href="http://www.midus.wisc.edu/findings/pdfs/1803.pdf">even mortality</a> – better than your actual age. In each case, the younger you feel, the healthier you are.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>The link probably goes in both directions. So while it’s true that ill-health may make you feel older, a higher subjective age could also limit your physical activity and increase feelings of vulnerability that make it hard to cope with stress – both of which could, independently, lead to illness. The result could even be a vicious cycle, where feelings of accelerated ageing lead you to become more inactive, and the resulting ill-health then further confirms your pessimistic views. And as <a href="http://www.bbc.com/future/story/20180712-the-age-you-feel-means-more-than-your-actual-birthdate">I recently wrote for BBC Future</a>, understanding this process could be essential for designing more effective health programmes.</p>
<p>Yannick Stephan at the University of Montpellier has led much of the work examining this phenomenon, and <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0160289617303598">his latest paper</a>, published with colleagues in the journal <i>Intelligence</i>, extends this understanding by revealing a surprising link with IQ. According to this research, the more intelligent we are in our late teens and early 20s, the younger we will feel in our 70s – and this may also be reflected in various markers of biological ageing.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><span id="more-34472"></span></p>
<p>Stephan’s team’s analysis is based on data from the Wisconsin Longitudinal Study, which for many years has tracked thousands of men and women born between 1937 and 1940. In 1957, each member of the study took an IQ test, which Stephan then compared to their estimated subjective age, taken more than 50 years later in 2011.</p>
<p>In line with other studies, the average participant felt about 17 per cent younger in their 70s than their actual age – but the precise difference depended on their adolescent intelligence (those participants who’d had higher teen IQ felt even younger), a link that remained even when the analysis controlled for the influence of demographic factors.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>After establishing this basic correlation, Stephan’s team also looked for other personal characteristics, such as education level and different personality traits, that might mediate the relationship. They found that greater “openness to experience”, which is associated with having<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>a higher IQ, seemed to be important. Perhaps a higher IQ, which helps us to process complex information more easily, also increases our curiosity about the world, and it’s that sense of wonder and excitement that can make us feel more youthful.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Having higher intelligence might also make it easier to cope with the challenges that come with age, so that we don’t feel so vulnerable to our changing circumstances. And people with higher IQ may also be better able to deconstruct the negative age stereotypes that might otherwise place limits on our behaviour and lead to greater feelings of vulnerability.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>The study chimes with others that have similarly linked a higher childhood IQ to various signs of biological ageing, including the length of our cells’ telomeres (the protective “caps” on the end of chromosomes that tend to shorten over the lifespan) and epigenetic markers.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Given that lower subjective age appears to encourage healthier behaviours, these new findings could help to explain these earlier IQ-ageing correlations. But once again, we should be wary of oversimplifying these relationships. A higher IQ could easily enhance our health through other pathways, such as the socioeconomic advantage that comes with better education.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Stephan’s paper can’t unpick all these mechanisms, but it could certainly provoke some fascinating future research on the ways our cognitive abilities influence the ageing process.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>I’d be particularly interested to see similar studies that look beyond the reasoning found on traditional intelligence tests. As <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2017/07/21/why-some-smart-people-make-foolish-decisions/">Research Digest explored last year</a>, our critical thinking skills (such as how well we are able to dispassionately evaluate an argument), are more predictive than our basic IQ of the likelihood we will experience many life events – from the small stresses such as losing your passport to getting divorced, falling into debt, or catching a sexually transmitted diseases.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Might other measures of “good” thinking, prove to have an even closer link to the measures of subjective and biological ageing? It would be fascinating to see if these skills – which can be taught – could also help people cope with the challenges of old age, by reducing stressful mistakes and encouraging healthier behaviours, and by helping us to question age stereotypes.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>In the meantime, Stephan’s paper provides one more fascinating example of the far-reaching effects of our thinking and reasoning abilities, far beyond their obvious influence over our academic and professional success.</p>

<p>When we say that our close friends have become a part of us, we’re usually talking metaphorically. Yet prior research has shown there is a literal sense in which this is true. For instance, <a href="http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0146167202250220">we’re slower at judging whether given personality traits apply to us or our friends</a>, compared with when judging whether traits belong to us or someone we’re not close to – it’s as if our friends’ traits and our own have somehow become shared, which makes the judgment trickier. Similarly, in terms of brain activity, <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022103109002339">we respond to mistakes made by friends in a similar way to how we respond to our own mistakes</a>.</p>
<p>Now a team led by Sarah Ketay at the University Hartford have shown how this absorption of friends into our self-concept can manifest at a visual level, affecting our ability to distinguish their faces from our own. <a href="http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0265407518788702">Writing in the Journal of Social and Personal Relationships</a>, Ketay’s team said “The present research supports the idea that close others are processed preferentially and may overlap with the self.”</p>
<p><span id="more-34451"></span></p>
<p>An initial study with 24 female undergrads involved them looking at a series of photos of their own face interspersed with photos of a close female friend’s face: each time a face appeared on-screen they had to press a button as fast as possible to indicate whether it was their face or their friend’s. In another condition, the challenge was similar but this time they had to distinguish between their own face and the face of a gender and race-matched celebrity, such as Reese Witherspoon. All the faces had neutral expressions.</p>
<p>The participants’ reaction times were slower in the friend condition than the celebrity condition suggesting they found it more difficult to distinguish their own face from their friend’s face, than from a celebrity’s face. Further analysis confirmed this wasn’t due to any differences in similarity of the friend’s/celebrity’s faces compared with their own, nor due to any lack of familiarity with the celebrity faces.</p>
<p>A second study with more female undergrads was similar, but this time the researchers used morphing to blend the participants’ faces either with the faces of a close female friend or with the face of a gender and race-matched celebrity. Again the challenge was to indicate as fast as possible whether the face on-screen was their own or someone else’s. This time the participants were slower to make the self-other judgment when their face was morphed with their friend’s than when it was morphed with a celebrity’s.</p>
<p>The sample sizes were small (though the study was not underpowered) and exclusively female, so a replication attempt of these findings would certainly be welcome. However, the results are novel: “No previous studies have considered the possibility that … self-other overlap may extend to facial processing,” the researchers said.</p>

<p>In our culture we like to speculate about the effects of different parenting styles on children. A lot of this debate is wasted breath. Twin studies – that compare similarities in outcomes between genetically identical and non-identical twins raised by their biological or adopted parents – have already shown us that parental influence is far more modest than we usually assume. Now a <a href="http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/1948550618784890">paper</a> in <em>Social Psychological and Personality Science</em> goes further, using the twin approach to reveal how it is mistaken to see the parent-child dynamic as a one-way relationship. “Given the current evidence … it is more accurate to conceptualise parenting as a transactional process in which both parents and children exert simultaneous and continuous influence on each other,” write Mona Ayoub at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign and her colleagues.</p>
<p><span id="more-34446"></span></p>
<p>Ayoub’s team used data from the Texas Twin Project, including parents’ ratings of their parenting style (specifically, their warmth and stress levels in relation to each child), and the children’s ratings of their own personality traits based on a kids’ version of the Big Five personality test. In all there were 497 identical twin pairs in the study, 480 same-sex non-identical twin pairs, and 434 opposite-sex twins, and their average age was 13.</p>
<p>The logic underlying the researchers’ approach was that if children affect their parents’ parenting style via their own gene-linked traits, then, on average, the parenting style towards each twin in a pair of identical twins should be more similar than the parenting style towards each twin in a pair of non-identical twins.</p>
<p>That’s exactly what the researchers found. Twenty-seven per cent of the variance in parents’ levels of warmth, and forty-five per cent of the variance in their parental stress levels, was attributable to genetic influences originating in their children. A significant portion of this genetic influence was related to the children’s personality traits: kids who scored higher on agreeableness and conscientiousness tended to have parents who parented with greater warmth, and kids with lower agreeableness had parents who parented with more stress.</p>
<p>The data back up what many mothers and fathers already know through experience – being a paragon of patient parenting is not much effort when your little darling is an angel, it is much trickier when they are a brat.</p>
<p>The children’s personality traits explained about half of the association between children’s genes and their parents’ behaviour, suggesting other gene-linked traits in the children also have an influence, such as, the researchers suggested, depression and “externalising behaviours”, which means things like aggression and disobedience.</p>
<p>The study was also able to look for the influence of non-shared environmental factors on the parents’ behaviour and the children’s personality traits – these are environmental (non-gene linked) factors that affect one twin but not the other, contributing to different parenting styles toward each twin in the same family. The data can’t specify what these factors are, but an illness that affects one twin but not the other would be an example.</p>
<p>Though less significant than children’s genetic effects, the researchers found that non-shared environmental factors both increased parents’ stress levels and reduced children’s conscientiousness and emotional stability (it’s not clear if such environmental factors affect parental stress, which then has an adverse effect on their children’s personality, or vice versa, or both).</p>
<p>Ayoub and her colleagues highlighted the practical implications of their findings: “parenting interventions may be more efficacious if both parents and children are treated, such that the intervention is tailored to the unique qualities of both parties.”</p>
<p>A limitation of the study is that it only provides a snapshot of the dynamics between parents and children. It’s likely that the effect of children’s personalities on their parents’ nurturing style is just one aspect of an unfolding dynamic, as parenting style then feeds back and affects the child (albeit more modestly than we often assume). “Longitudinal designs that assess child personality and parenting throughout development will be useful,” the researchers said, “especially because parenting can take different meanings across different developmental stages.”</p>

                <h4><a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/neuroskeptic/?p=9637">How Accessible is Psychology Data?</a></h4>

In a slightly depressing new paper, two researchers describe how they tried to get access to the data behind 111 of the most cited psychology and psychiatry papers published in the past decade. The researchers, Tom E. Hardwicke and John P. A. Ioannidis of Stanford, wanted to place the data into a 'Data Ark' to ensure its continued preservation for science. Unfortunately, in most cases, the data was not made available.



The paper is called Populating the Data Ark and it's out now in PLoS ON

                <h4><a href="https://blog.scienceexchange.com/2018/08/child-resistant-packaging-service-now-on-science-exchange/">Child-Resistant Packaging Service Now on Science Exchange</a></h4>

<p>When it comes to the creation of commercial packaging, safety can make or break a brand. Custom child-resistant (CR) packaging is one of the most sought after needs in the chemical and pharma industries. CR packaging is used to reduce the risk of children ingesting hazardous substances.To maintain the branding with added child resistant protection, some products underscore the need for custom packaging solutions. Examples of such products would be laundry detergent pod and recreational cannabis.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Developing CR packaging, however, can be an arduous task due to the intricate nature of possible materials used in the manufacturing process. To illustrate, most plastic closures are made of a material called polypropylene that is commonly used in plastic hinges. Due to the molecular structure of polypropylene, it is a very difficult material to prototype. Substitutes for polypropylene have their own set of prototyping challenges. As for other options, creating a closure for polyethylene bags or paperboard boxes is equally complicated. These materials lack rigidity, making mechanical locking systems tricky to develop.</span></p>
<p>Another critical barrier holding back CR packaging is its stringent certification requirement. Such products require a testing process that determines if the packaging follows the Consumer Product Safety Commission’s (CPSC) standards. The criteria of the testing process are strict and guarantee that small children, for example, are not able to open the package. The testing process adds at least several weeks to the product timeline.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Working with a reputable company that has a track record of developing innovative and certified CR mechanisms using sophisticated materials can give manufacturers a competitive edge, accelerating product development while lowering the risk of disastrous harm to consumers. That’s where Science Exchange provider </span><a href="https://www.scienceexchange.com/labs/creative-mechanisms-inc"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Creative Mechanism</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> comes in. They specialize in the development of innovative mechanical solutions as well as maintaining a high degree of know-how in product prototyping. </span><a href="https://www.scienceexchange.com/labs/creative-mechanisms-inc"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Contact the provider to learn more about their groundbreaking CR packaging solutions</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>

Thanks to a newly deciphered genome of red foxes, researchers have pinpointed regions in the animals’ DNA linked to taming them.

<p>You may think of people with high self-control as having enviable reserves of willpower, but recent findings suggest this isn’t the case. Instead it seems the strong-willed are canny folk, adept at <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2017/08/23/whether-you-snack-or-not-is-more-about-the-presence-of-temptation-than-your-willpower/">avoiding</a> <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2016/10/18/is-willpower-overrated/">temptation</a> in the first place. A new <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/15298868.2018.1495666">study</a> in the journal <em>Self and Identity</em> builds on this picture, showing that people high in self-control tend to experience less intense visceral states, like fatigue, hunger and stress (states that are known to encourage impulsive behaviour).</p>
<p>The new findings make sense: after all, it is much easier to be in control of your decisions if you are organised enough to ensure your animalistic needs rarely become overpowering.</p>
<p><span id="more-34427"></span></p>
<p>Cassandra Baldwin’s team exploited five years’ worth of relevant data from their lab, taking in studies that had measured trait self-control (rated through agreement with statements like “I have hard time breaking bad habits” and “I am able to work effectively toward long-term goals”) and that involved one-shot self-reports of states like hunger, fatigue, daily stress, and symptoms of the common cold.</p>
<p>The researchers ended up with data from over 5,500 college students, mostly women, collected in 25 studies. In many cases, they also had information on how much sleep the participants had had the previous night and the amount of time since they had last eaten.</p>
<p>The results were very consistent: higher trait self-control correlated with less intense experience of all the measured visceral states, from hunger to cold symptoms.</p>
<p>Importantly, amount of sleep the previous night, and time since last eating, partly mediated these associations, suggesting that people with high self-control experience less hunger and less fatigue to some extent because they get more sleep and don’t go so long without eating.</p>
<p>Baldwin and her colleagues said their results “are consistent with prior findings that high trait self-control facilitates structuring one’s life in order to avoid negative consequences.”</p>
<p>The associations uncovered in this research were modest is size, but they remained statistically significant regardless of the time of day, or the time in the semester, that the participants had reported their states. Also, the researchers pointed out that while modest in size, the effects they observed would quickly accumulate. Take, for example, the correlation between higher self-control and getting more sleep the preceding night: “On any given night we would expect a person low in trait self-control to sleep about 20 minutes less than a person high in trait self-control,” the researchers explained. “Over the span of a week, this adds up to a two-hour difference in sleep duration – an accumulation of sleep debt that may have consequences for health and behavior.”</p>
<p>Although the methodology of this research can’t prove that having higher self-control leads to experiencing milder visceral states (via better organized sleep and eating behaviors), the data are certainly consistent with that picture. Longitudinal research that follows people over time will be able to confirm this account.</p>
<p>The reliance on college students is another short-coming. But perhaps more problematic is that these findings still leave open the question of what it is about high self-control individuals that allows them, more than others, to better plan their lives so that they experience less stress and milder visceral states. If it isn’t deep reserves of willpower, what is it?</p>
<p>The emerging picture is that high self-control is associated with having a pervasive inclination for orderliness, planning and thinking ahead, which sounds very much like trait conscientiousness (and personality research has shown that high <a href="http://www.bbc.com/future/story/20180221-the-hidden-side-to-your-personality">conscientiousness too is associated with living more healthily and experiencing less stress</a>). So, where then does conscientiousness come from? There is no simple, complete answer as yet, but we do know the trait is partly genetically inherited and that it is fostered through having meaningful social roles and responsibilities.</p>

<p>Teaching, it has often been said, is the one profession that creates all other professions. Therefore it is so important that we learn how to do it right. The ways that teachers learn from each other is likely to be an important part of this, especially how they discern each other’s expertise and whether<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>they are inclined to seek advice and help from the most able.</p>
<p>A team led by James Spillane at Northwestern University has published <a href="http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.3102/0162373718785764?journalCode=epaa">a study</a> in <i>Educational Evaluation and Policy Analysis</i> that looks into these teacher behaviours. The researchers employed a mixed-method approach that spanned five years and involved staff from fourteen different primary schools in the US. This included surveys and interviews to explore how maths teachers conceptualised expert teaching, and then an analysis of student test scores along with teachers’ self-reported interactions with their colleagues, to assess if expert teachers behave differently from their peers.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><span id="more-34401"></span></p>
<p>The first part of the study focused on finding out what information teachers draw on to form their opinion of which of their colleagues is an expert. With schools nowadays awash with data to track student progress, one obvious way to assess which teachers are most expert is to compare their class test scores. However, results from this study suggest that those at the chalkface tend not to use this metric.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Over 90 per cent of staff referred to something other than student test scores, with common answers including their colleagues’ “instructional practice”, which incorporated: how their peers questioned students; the organisation and flow of their lessons; and their ability to generate student engagement, enthusiasm and excitement for the subject. Other factors included: their peers’ “knowledge and enthusiasm for teaching their subject”, which also included the ability to explain their subject to their peers; as well as their “formal position and formal training”,<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>which covered their role in the school and which professional development they had previously undertaken.</p>
<p>Why did the majority of teachers not use student test scores as a key factor when weighing up teaching expertise? The researchers suggested that “teachers do not trust student test scores as valid measures of teacher performance in general” or, if they do, that “student test scores may not be easily remembered or accessed as teachers make decisions about whom to seek for advice, especially if such decisions are made quickly during the work day”. Essentially, weighing up teaching expertise was seen as something that you can sense, as opposed to being measurable by objective numerical data.</p>
<p>The second part of the study looked at which teachers were most likely to give or seek advice from their colleagues. The researchers found that the best teachers, as measured by those who had a higher percentage of students who met the minimum requirement to pass their class, and whose classes had higher than average test scores, were no more likely to be sought out by their colleagues for their advice. On the other hand, these expert teachers were the ones who were actually more likely to seek advice from their peers the following year. It seems that the better the teacher performed, the more likely they were to go out and obtain feedback on how to be even better.</p>
<p>The finding that the most able are not particularly sought after for their advice and are instead more likely to seek it from others is perhaps unsurprising. Other research, known as the <a href="https://blog.innerdrive.co.uk/studies/18-the-one-about-the-dunning-kruger-effect">Dunning-Kruger effect</a>, has found that the least able tend to have an inflated view of their abilities, which would presumably lead to them seeking out less feedback. After all, why would one seek out advice if they think there is little room for development? As for the expert teachers in this study, the researchers speculate that their advice-seeking tendencies may be explained as “they represent a group of teachers who are constantly striving to improve by seeking out advice and information from others”.</p>
<p>It should be noted that the teachers studied in this research were from primary schools, which typically put less emphasis on test results. Likewise, they were selected from a school district in America that did not have a large emphasis on teacher accountability for student test results. It is possible that in other circumstances teachers may measure expertise differently, and be more likely to seek out those whose students consistently got the best test results.</p>
<p>That being said, this study does have some interesting potential implications for educators. First, any policy makers relying solely on student test scores to measure teacher effectiveness may be met with scepticism amongst school staff. Second, and perhaps most importantly, schools should actively encourage their staff to view asking for help and advice as a sign of strength and not of weakness. This would result in schools utilising their expert teachers more effectively, which would likely boost staff morale, abilities and test scores.</p>

<p><em>By</em> <a href="http://www.psychologywriter.org.uk/">Christian Jarrett</a></p>
<p>Admitting mistakes, seeking help, apologising first, confessing one’s romantic feelings – all these kind of situations involve intentional expressions of vulnerability, in which we may fear being rejected or being judged negatively, yet we grit our teeth and go ahead anyway. According to a team of psychologists <a href="http://psycnet.apa.org/record/2018-34832-002">writing in the <em>Journal of Personality and Social Psychology</em></a> contrary to our worst fears, having the courage to show our vulnerability in these ways will often be rewarded. That’s because there is an intriguing mismatch in the way we take a more negative view of our own vulnerability than we do of other people’s – the researchers call this “the beautiful mess effect”.</p>
<p><span id="more-34404"></span></p>
<p>Anna Bruk and her colleagues at the University of Mannheim were inspired in part by Brené Brown’s book <em><a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Daring-Greatly-Courage-Vulnerable-Transforms/dp/0241257409/">Daring Greatly: How the Courage to Be Vulnerable Transforms the Way We Live, Love, Parent, and Lead</a></em> in which she argues, based on interviews she’s conducted and other qualitative evidence, that “we love seeing raw truth and openness in other people, but we are afraid to let them see it in us … Vulnerability is courage in you and inadequacy in me.”</p>
<p>To find some experimental evidence to back up this idea, and to test a possible explanation, Bruk and her team conducted seven studies with hundreds of participants. The format for many was that the participants were asked to imagine scenarios in which either they or another person displayed intentional vulnerability – such as confessing romantic love or admitting to a mistake – and then they either rated their own vulnerability (e.g. how strongly they agreed they had shown courage or weakness), or the other person’s vulnerability, respectively.  Time and again, and across many different contexts, participants perceived their own vulnerability more negatively and less positively than other people’s.</p>
<p>Of course, asking people to imagine hypothetical scenarios is always going to lack realism. For another study, the researchers contrived matters so that participants either expected to display vulnerability themselves in a real-life situation (improvising a song in front of a jury) or they expected someone else to display that vulnerability in front of them (that is, the participant would be a member of the jury). In fact, the performance didn’t go ahead, but participants agreed it was an act of vulnerability and either rated themselves (if they were to be the singer) or they rated the other person – again, participants rated other people’s vulnerability much more positively than they rated their own.</p>
<p>Bruk and her team think that a key mechanism explaining this contrast in perspectives is to do with the “construal level” – they found evidence that when we think about our own vulnerability we do so very concretely (i.e. with a low construal level) whereas when we think about others’ vulnerability we do so more abstractly (i.e. with a high construal level).  Previous research on so-called “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Construal_level_theory">construal level theory</a>” has already shown that a higher, more abstract construal level is associated with a more positive, risk-friendly perspective, so it follows that viewing the vulnerability of others with this mindset would lead to more positive impressions.</p>
<p>The researchers argue their findings are important given earlier research showing the benefits of expressing vulnerability: self-disclosure can build trust, seeking help can boost learning, admitting mistakes can foster forgiveness, and confessing one’s romantic feelings can lead to new relationships.</p>
<p>“Even when examples of showing vulnerability might sometimes feel more like weakness from the inside, our findings indicate, that, to others, these acts might look more like courage from the outside,” Bruk and her colleagues concluded. “Given the discussed positive consequences of showing vulnerability for the relationship quality, health, or job performance, it might, indeed, be beneficial to try to overcome one’s fears and to choose to see the beauty in the mess of vulnerable situations.”</p>

<p>A recent trend in domestication is a selection of traits that closely relate to an animal’s wild ancestors.  The Czechoslovakian Wolfdog (CWD), a cross between the Carpathian wolf and the German Shepard, is an example of this type of selective breeding.  A study by Caniglia et al. published in <em><a href="https://bmcgenomics.biomedcentral.com/">BMC Genomics</a> </em>performed a genome-wide analysis of CWD to compare its genome with the parental population (Carpathian wolves and German Shepherds).</p>
<p>A genome-wide analysis of 170k Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms was performed in 12 unrelated CWD and 12 unrelated Carpathian wolves.  Genotypes from these individuals were then compared to each other as well as genotypes of 355 dogs from 30 breeds. CWD genomes were distinct from Carpathian wolves and German Shepherds, but there were also genetic similarities.  Within the CWD genome over 300 genes were more associated with wolf ancestry and over than 2000 genes were more associated with dog ancestry.</p>
<p>Interestingly, specific gene analysis found that the genes associated with wolf ancestry related to morphological phenotypes such as a narrow face, short ears, and a pointed chin while the dog-related genes were associated with communication and behavior such as brain development, sociality and cognition.</p>

<p><img alt="Pixabay" class="alignleft wp-image-10411 size-medium" height="300" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2018/07/Cognitive-behavioral-therapy-200x300.jpg" title="Pixabay" width="200" />Cognitive behavioral therapy for psychosis (CBTp) has been used to treat people with schizophrenia.  Although the success of CBTp on core psychotic symptoms, such as hallucinations, are less than promising, a thorough assessment of the effectiveness of CBTp on non-symptomatic outcomes, such as quality of life, has yet to be determined.</p>
<p>A recent meta-analysis by Laws et al. published in <em><a href="https://bmcpsychology.biomedcentral.com/">BMC Psychology</a> </em>sought to determine the effectiveness of CBTp on functioning, distress, and quality of life in people with schizophrenia.  A total of 37 randomized controlled trials were included in the meta-analysis.</p>
<p>CBTp showed mild effectiveness for functioning in people with schizophrenia, but this effect was not long lasting.  No significant benefit of CBTp was found for distress or quality of life. The results of this meta-analysis suggest that CBTp may not be an effective treatment for non-symptomatic outcomes in people with schizophrenia.</p>

<p>A total of 12,372 14-17-year olds from Germany, Greece, Iceland, Netherlands, Poland, Romania and Spain answered questionnaires related to socio-demographic variables and cyberbullying.  Approximately 22% of adolescents experienced cyberbullying with the highest rates in Romania (37.3%) and the lowest rates in Spain (13.3%).  Cyberbullying was also associated with higher rates of internalizing problems, which include social withdrawal and anxiety, as well as externalizing problems, such as aggression.</p>

<p>Parasites can greatly impact the health of animals, and factors such as temperature, group size, and diet can influence parasite infection.  A study by Hokan et al. published in <em><a href="https://bmcecol.biomedcentral.com/">BMC Ecology</a></em> examined how sleeping site impacts parasite infection by comparing two nocturnal lemurs: the Milne-Edwards sportive lemur and the Western woolly lemur. Since both of these species have similar diets, live in the same habitat, are of similar size, and live in pairs, the authors were able to specifically analyze the effect of sleeping site.</p>
<p>The sleeping sites of twenty-six sportive lemurs and 22 woolly lemurs were recorded and feces was collected to analyze infection intensity and parasite species.  Researchers found that sportive lemur sleep sites exclusively sleep in tree holes and will use the same sites repeatedly. In contrast woolly lemurs sleep on branches and vary their sleeping sites. Fecal analysis found that the probability of sportive lemurs shedding parasite eggs was three times higher than woolly lemurs.</p>
<p>These findings suggest that repeated use of tree holes as a sleeping site can increase parasite exposure and infection.</p>

The internal suicide debate hypothesis assumes that upon a suicidal crisis, individuals weigh reasons for living (e.g. family) versus reasons for dying (e.g. hopelessness) in their decision to commit suicide. A recent study by Brüdern et al. published in <em><u><a href="https://bmcpsychiatry.biomedcentral.com/">BMC Psychiatry</a></u></em> studied reasons for living (RFL) and reasons for dying (RFD) in predicting future depression, suicidal ideation, and suicide attempts in suicide attempters.</p>
<p>Sixty suicide attempters admitted to the emergency department were provided questionnaires to measure depression, suicidal ideation, RFL, and RFD. The number of RFL did not predict future depression, suicidal ideation or suicide attempts, but more RFD at initial admission predicted greater levels of depression and suicidal ideation for up to 2 years as well as another suicide attempt 1 year after initial assessment.</p>

The evidence linking MSG to these symptoms is weak and a double-blind placebo-controlled study found no evidence for the so-called Chinese restaurant syndrome.<sup>1</sup> I chimed in that the logic behind MSG syndrome didn’t even make sense to me since MSG is just glutamate salt. I said “<em>your body knows how to regulate glutamate since it’s probably the most important neurotransmitter in your brain</em>”. I was met with blank stares. That’s when I realized that glutamate doesn’t have a particularly good publicist.</p>
<p>To be fair to glutamate’s hypothetical marketing team, the job of selling glutamate to the public hasn’t always been easy. First, glutamate wasn’t truly established as a neurotransmitter until the 1980s, decades after more widely known neuromodulators like dopamine and serotonin. Indeed, the 1950s, 60s, and 70s were a period of neurotransmitter mania. Dopamine loss was shown to cause Parkinson’s disease. The original antidepressant medications were shown to alter brain serotonin and norepinephrine levels. A link between schizophrenia and dopamine was established. This era culminated in the concept of neurochemical imbalances, the idea that psychiatric illnesses are caused by improper neurotransmitter levels in the brain. Consequently, neurotransmitters got tidy functional descriptions like “dopamine is rewarding” that were cemented into the popular imagination of the brain. Glutamate, partly because it missed this era, but also because it’s too ubiquitous to all brain functions, has never been pinned with a  neat functional description that the public could easily digest.</p>
<p>While Nobel prizes were handed out for work on norepinephrine and dopamine, neuroscientists debated if glutamate even served a specialized function in the brain, at all. Glutamate was already known as an essential amino acid, a building block of proteins. Glutamate was also known to be a component of the Krebs cycle, the sequence of reactions responsible for producing cellular energy in the form of ATP. So every cell in our body, not just neurons, has a lot of glutamate floating around, participating in many non-neurotransmission things. You could say that glutamate was hiding in plain sight from mid-century neuroscientists. It was abundant, ubiquitous, and busy serving other functions. No single experiment proved that glutamate was a transmitter. It took decades of incremental progress to establish glutamate’s neurotransmitter bona fides. Drugs that looked a lot like glutamate seemed to have profound effects on neurons in a dish. Different types of glutamate receptors were discovered and their contributions to neuronal function were delineated through incremental progress.<sup>2</sup> By the 1980s, overwhelming experimental evidence pointed to glutamate as not only a true neurotransmitter, but the brain’s most common messenger in neuron-to-neuron communication.</p>
<figure class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_19626"><a href="http://blogs.plos.org/neuro/files/2018/08/Sam.jpg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-19626" height="315" src="http://blogs.plos.org/neuro/files/2018/08/Sam-300x226.jpg" width="419" /></a>Pubmed search results for “glutamate neurotransmitter” vs. “serotonin neurotransmitter” or “dopamine neurotransmitter”, by year. Despite being the brain’s principle excitatory transmitter, research into glutamate neurotransmission didn’t gain traction until the 1980s, well after dopamine and serotonin.</figure>
<p>Today, the things that happen within the few nanometers of a glutamatergic synapse are the obsession of whole fields of neuroscience. That being said, glutamate, itself, is rarely placed at the center of the narrative.  In contrast to the 50s-70s, today’s neuroscience casts circuits (ensembles of connected neurons), rather than transmitters, as the central characters in the brain. Today we are told that circuits are the conduit for how we learn, think, and feel. Even though most of these circuits require glutamate neurotransmission, glutamate itself is not the star of the show. Instead, it’s cast as a small piece of the bigger puzzle that is the neural circuit.</p>
<p><strong>Do we really know how glutamate is made?</strong></p>
<p>A question often asked about neurotransmitters is, how do they get made? In the 50s-70s, neurotransmitter origin stories were the intensely studied. Biochemical maps of dopamine and serotonin synthesis were drawn into text books and are still a popular quiz subject in introductory neuroscience courses. How your brain’s glutamate gets made, though, has never quite had a satisfying answer. The most recognized mechanism for brain glutamate synthesis is actually not synthesis at all but recycling. Specialized brain cells called astrocytes take a breakdown product of glutamate, glutamine, and reconvert it to glutamate before shuttling it back to neurons. So glutamate comes from old glutamate, which begs the question where does the original glutamate come from? To this question, the answer seems to be a shrug. Perhaps it comes from the Krebs cycle or from broken down proteins or from diet. A study published in the May issue of <em>Cell </em>introduces a new idea, what if it comes from the sun?<sup>3</sup></p>
<p>Authors from The University of Science and Technology of China used a novel, sensitive way to measure chemicals within single neurons. With this technique, the authors found a handful of chemicals that have never been measured before in neurons, one of which is something called urocanic acid. Though no one’s seen it in the brain before now, urocanic acid has an interesting role in the skin, where it is thought to act like a natural sunscreen by absorbing UV rays. In fact, urocanic acid levels in the skin actually increase with prolonged sun exposure. So, the authors wondered if brain urocanic acid has anything to do with this skin urocanic acid system. They exposed mice (after a quick buzz cut) to UV-B rays, a type of UV ray emitted by the sun. Surprisingly, urocanic acid increased <em>inside neurons</em> after a few hours of UV-B exposure to the skin.</p>
<p>So, exposure to UV-B elevates urocanic acid in the skin and bloodstream, which gets into your brain and elevates the levels of urocanic acid inside neurons. What does this have to do with glutamate? In the liver, there’s an enzyme that can convert urocanic acid to glutamate. Up until now, no one really considered whether this enzyme is in the brain and active. The authors probed for it, found it, and showed that this enzyme is responsive to changes in urocanic acid. So along with increasing urocanic acid, UV-B exposure actually increases glutamate levels nearly <em>3-fold</em> (!) inside neurons. The last real question the authors had to answer is whether or not this increase in glutamate affects brain functions. The authors presented two pieces of evidence suggesting that it does. First, they saw stronger, more robust, synaptic transmission in the hippocampus, a brain region associated with learning and memory, in mice exposed to UV-B. Last, they assessed two different learning paradigms in live mice, following UV-B exposure. They showed that mice exposed to UV-B were better at both motor learning (behaviors like balance and coordination) and recognition memory (behaviors like learning and recalling new objects).</p>
<p><strong>Again, so how does the brain make glutamate?</strong></p>
<p>This study, utilizing a new way to detect trace chemicals within neurons, stumbled into a novel way the mammalian brain makes one of its most important transmitters. Since mice are nocturnal, it’s a bit peculiar that UV-B rays produce such profound, glutamate-elevating effects. We don’t really know if humans get a sun-triggered boost in glutamate to the same degree as the mice in these experiments, who are experiencing UV-B rays for the first time. Though another question that one might propose is whether diurnal mammals, because they’re outside during daylight, produce more neuronal glutamate than nocturnal mammals like mice. One can’t help but think about the evolutionary trade-off between the safety of a nocturnal lifestyle and the boost in brain capacity provided by sun exposure. Perhaps nocturnal mammals like mice get by on subsistence levels of glutamate, derived from the Krebs cycle. Sun exposure, on the other hand, unlocks a potent driver of glutamate synthesis, boosting, perhaps even tripling, glutamate levels and neuronal signaling capacity in diurnal mammals like us. While these are merely suggestions at this point, it’s intriguing to think that such fundamental aspects of glutamate neurotransmission are still unknown. That should be expected, though, since glutamate – despite being one of the single most important chemicals in the brain – has never really been cast in a dynamic role.</p>

<p>The idea that we prefer desirable objects – and people – that are physically closer to us has been around for decades. All other things being equal, a potentially dangerous animal that’s close is known to seem scarier than one that’s further away, and it’s been suggested that, in a mirror effect, a nearby desirable person or object is more enticing or attractive than the same one positioned at some distance.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span></p>
<p>But although this propinquity effect “continues to be a popular topic in introductory social psychology courses, there are surprisingly few works that offer compelling experimental evidence that distance itself influences affective reaction to an object,” note the authors of a <a href="http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0146167218784903">new paper</a>, in <i>Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin</i>, that plugs that gap. Their main finding: men tend to prefer women who are physically closer to them.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><span id="more-34398"></span></p>
<p>The researchers, from South Korea and Singapore, and led by Ji-eun Shin, ran a series of studies to investigate, focusing their attention mostly on male judgements of women.</p>
<p>In one, a group of male participants read lines from a modern musical version of Romeo and Juliet with an unfamiliar woman (actually a confederate helping the researchers) who was sitting either 80 centimetres or 150 centimetres away. Overall, those in the close condition reported afterwards that they liked the woman more. A deeper analysis of the data showed that this held only for men who were single, not for those in romantic relationships.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>In another study, images of just the faces of eight women, who were matched for physical attractiveness, were presented in pairs, separately to each eye, of another group of male and female participants, with one face appearing to be slightly closer than the other. Both men and women reported liking the faces that appeared closer, and this effect was stronger for men who reported being less satisfied with their current social relationships.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>In a separate study, single men watched a video clip of a woman (rated earlier by others as being “mildly attractive”) who stood either 60 cm or 150 cm away from the camera, and who gazed directly into the lens. Again, the participants reported liking the woman more when she was closer, and they estimated that they’d have greater success in asking her out on a date – in other words, she seemed more accessible. This effect was greater for men who’d scored higher on a questionnaire measuring their feelings of loneliness. (The researchers don’t mention the sexual orientation of these volunteers; it seems to be assumed that they were heterosexual.)</p>
<p>Overall, the results support the general idea that proximity amplifies liking. And the researchers also present preliminary data suggesting that people like other desirable objects – including hamburgers and wrapped presents – more when they are physically closer.</p>
<p>A closer hamburger might seem more appealing because it would require less physical effort to acquire than a hamburger that’s further away. But when it comes to interactions with other people, there’s clearly more going on.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>As the researchers note, while strangers on public transport generally try to sit as far away from each other as they can, lovers “sit tight”. If someone is standing close to you at a party or in a bar, this may signal that they’re keen to interact – either to chat as a potential friend, or as a potential sexual partner. Especially for a lonely, single person, someone who seems to be sending this<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>“accessibility” signal may then appear more desirable than someone who’s positioned at the other side of the room. “From an actor’s standpoint, it would require less psychological and physical effort to befriend a person who seems more approachable and socially receptive (conveyed by proximity),” the researchers write.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>The researchers focused mainly on male attitudes towards women, because, they argue, men are less choosy about who they consider desirable for sex, and more likely to interpret a woman who is standing near to them as showing signs of sexual interest – so they felt a proximity effect was more likely to be apparent for men.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>This new evidence for the “propinquity effect” is welcome, but mysteries remain about why it occurs and clearly more studies are needed on how it affects women’s feelings, and testing how<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>it plays out in other cultures.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

But publishers had assumed they would simply port the traditional subscription model to the online environment and carry on much as before, all be it a subscription model re-imagined as the now infamous <span class="MsoHyperlink"><a href="http://www.infotoday.com/it/sep11/The-Big-Deal-Not-Price-But-Cost.shtml">Big Deal</a></span>.</span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span>In other words, as the name suggests, what was radical about the BOAI was not its recognition that journals could now be put online, but the assumption that this could be done without the imposition of paywalls. In retrospect, we can see that this simple idea has ended up calling into question practically every aspect of traditional scholarly publishing, not excluding traditional peer review and the need for legacy publishers. </span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><h3><span lang="EN-US"><span style="font-size: large;">Yet …</span></span></h3><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span>Yet for all its revolutionary potential, and the significant mindshare that open access has acquired over the past 16 years, some of the key <span class="MsoHyperlink"><a href="http://www.budapestopenaccessinitiative.org/read">aspirations articulated</a></span> by BOAI have yet to be realised. And they may never be. Yes, today more research is freely accessible. But leaving aside the fact that the openness of that content <span class="MsoHyperlink"><a href="https://osf.io/uaw27/">is fragile</a></span><a name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">[1]</span></span></span></a>, the truly revolutionary potential of making it open has not yet been exploited. </span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span>So, for instance, OA has yet to solve <span class="MsoHyperlink"><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4144706/">the affordability problem</a></span> that BOAI promised it would, and in pursuit of which goal most librarians joined the OA movement in the first place.</span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span>More importantly, OA has failed to create the more equitable knowledge infrastructure envisaged by BOAI. Let’s recall: the promise was that removing access barriers would allow the world to “accelerate research, enrich education, share the learning of the rich with the poor and the poor with the rich … and lay the foundation for uniting humanity in a common intellectual conversation and quest for knowledge.”</span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span>The reality today, however, is that paywalls are simply being replaced by publication walls, a development that threatens to disenfranchise those in the global South even more thoroughly than paywalls. </span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span>These failings are a product of the fact that the strategies adopted and promoted by OA advocates have too often had unintended consequences. Above all, they advocated for the use of pay-to-publish gold OA. In doing so they enabled legacy publishers to co-opt open access, and so lock themselves and their high profits into the new environment, not least by introducing overpriced <span class="MsoHyperlink"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hybrid_open-access_journal">hybrid OA</a></span>.</span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span>The pay-to-publish model also gave rise to a plague of <span class="MsoHyperlink"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Predatory_open-access_publishing">predatory publishers</a></span>, and the accompanying tide of fake science now threatens to <span class="MsoHyperlink"><a href="https://www.icij.org/blog/2018/07/new-international-investigation-tackles-fake-science-and-its-poisonous-effects/">corrupt the scientific record</a></span>.</span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span>The nub of the problem is that OA advocates too often fail to think through their ideas and strategies, with the result that their interventions often worsen rather than improve the situation. It does not help that they are susceptible to groupthink and tend to flock around any idea that has superficial appeal. The way that dissident voices are challenged and policed on Twitter is indicative of this tendency. Moreover, OA advocates will often cling to a faulty idea long after it has become clear that it is flawed. </span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span>And while there were plenty of warnings about likely unintended consequences, these were ignored or poo-pooed. In 2004, for instance, the world’s largest and most experienced publisher Elsevier <span class="MsoHyperlink"><a href="https://www.elsevier.com/about/press-releases/research-and-journals/elsevier-submits-evidence-on-scientific-publishing-to-committee-of-uk-mps">cautioned</a></span>: “By introducing an author-pays model, Open Access risks undermining public trust in the integrity and quality of scientific publications that has been established over hundreds of years.”</span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span>Elsevier added, “Because the number of articles published will drive revenues, Open Access publishers will continually be under pressure to increase output, potentially at the expense of quality.”</span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span>Elsevier is of course not a disinterested party. Nevertheless, its point was a valid one and should have been listened to since it is also an obvious one. (Ironically, as soon as it realised that gold OA would allow it to increase its profits Elsevier quickly distanced itself from its warnings, thus proving the point it had made!).</span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span>But the most knowledgeable and far-sighted commentator has been publishing consultant <span class="MsoHyperlink"><a href="https://scholarlykitchen.sspnet.org/author/jesposito/">Joseph Esposito</a></span>. True, Esposito is not a disinterested party either, and he has a habit whenever a change to the <i>status quo</i> is mooted of muttering darkly “be careful what you wish for” (e.g. <span class="MsoHyperlink"><a href="http://liblicense.crl.edu/ListArchives/0610/msg00029.html">here</a></span>, <span class="MsoHyperlink"><a href="https://twitter.com/JosephJEsposito/status/1020025202607120384?s=19">here</a></span> and <span class="MsoHyperlink"><a href="https://scholarlykitchen.sspnet.org/2014/02/24/inadvertent-innovation">here</a></span>). Nevertheless, his warnings have generally been on the money. </span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span>In 2004, for instance, Esposito <span class="MsoHyperlink"><a href="https://journals.uic.edu/ojs/index.php/fm/article/view/1163/1083">predicted</a></span> that in an OA environment, “the overall cost of research publications will rise, though the costs will be borne by different players, primarily authors and their proxies.” This has proved accurate.</span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span>In the same vein, in 2014 Esposito predicted that open access would be additive rather than substitutive, and so further increase the costs of scholarly communication. As he put it, “revenue from OA will be additive to the revenue from traditional journals.”  That is today’s reality.</span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span>And in 2105 Esposito <span class="MsoHyperlink"><a href="https://scholarlykitchen.sspnet.org/2015/10/14/return-of-the-big-brands/">predicted</a></span> that open access would be co-opted by legacy publishers. Few would now deny that that too is today’s reality.</span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span>For open access advocates, this is all hugely frustrating and the cause of a lot of hand-wringing. The uncomfortable truth is that almost every initiative, idea or proposal introduced by the OA movement is rapidly derailed, subverted, or co-opted by publishers for their own benefit, or leads to undesirable developments like predatory publishing.</span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><h3><span lang="EN-US"><span style="font-size: large;">Too gloomy a view?</span></span></h3><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span>But is this to take too gloomy a view? While many of Esposito’s predictions may be today’s reality, it does not mean that they will be tomorrow’s. After all, we are in the middle of a revolution, and perforce seeing through a glass darkly. We may simply be witnessing the inevitable teething problems that any largescale social change can expect to experience. </span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span>To put my cards on the table: I am a sceptic by nature and so Esposito’s views resonate more with me than the perpetual Pollyannaism of many OA advocates. Nevertheless, I can see that it may just be that the research community is going to have to wade through a lot more mud before it reaches the promised land. </span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span>I assume, however, that whether the vision of BOAI is ever fully realised will to a great extent depend on whether those who support, promote and implement open access learn from experience and adapt and change their strategies as a result. </span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span>Here there are encouraging signs. Conscious that the institutional repository movement <span class="MsoHyperlink"><a href="https://poynder.blogspot.com/2016/09/q-with-cnis-clifford-lynch-time-to-re_22.html">has failed</a></span>, for instance, the <span class="MsoHyperlink"><a href="https://www.coar-repositories.org/">Confederation of Open Access Repositories</a></span> has developed a new strategy focused on creating what it calls a “<span class="MsoHyperlink"><a href="https://www.coar-repositories.org/activities/advocacy-leadership/open-science-and-sustainable-development/">Sustainable Knowledge Commons</a></span><span class="MsoHyperlink"><span style="color: windowtext;">”. </span></span></span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /><a name="more"></a></div><h3><span class="MsoHyperlink"><span lang="EN-US"><span style="font-size: large;">New determination</span></span></span></h3><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span class="MsoHyperlink"><span>More interestingly, in Europe we are seeing a new determination to insist that publishers start offering big deals that include a clear transition path to an all-OA environment. These deals, those pushing for them assert, must be fairly priced and they must consist of a package that includes both access to existing paywalled content <i>plus</i> the ability for researchers to publish papers OA on a constantly increasing basis. The Association of Universities in the Netherlands (</span></span><span class="MsoHyperlink"><span><a href="https://www.vsnu.nl/en_GB">VSNU</a></span></span><span class="MsoHyperlink"><span>), for instance, has been flexing its consortial muscle to that end and </span></span><span class="MsoHyperlink"><span><a href="https://www.utwente.nl/en/news/!/2018/3/79107/no-new-agreement-with-royal-society-of-chemistry-and-a-new-agreement-with-springer">turning down deals</a></span></span><span class="MsoHyperlink"><span> it does not feel meet its requirements.</span></span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span class="MsoHyperlink"><span>Meanwhile in Germany, </span></span><span class="MsoHyperlink"><span><a href="https://www.projekt-deal.de/about-deal/">Project Deal</a></span></span><span class="MsoHyperlink"><span> is insisting on what it calls “</span></span><span class="MsoHyperlink"><span><a href="http://www.sciencemag.org/news/2017/08/bold-open-access-push-germany-could-change-future-academic-publishing">Publish and Read</a></span></span><span class="MsoHyperlink"><span>” contracts that make even greater demands of publishers. This has led to a long-standing faceoff between Elsevier and the German research community. And after Sweden followed Germany’s lead</span></span><span> earlier this year Elsevier <span class="MsoHyperlink"><a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-05754-1">cut off access</a></span> to its electronic journals in both countries.</span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span>What has focused European minds is a fast-approaching deadline. In 2016, the EC made <span class="MsoHyperlink"><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/science/2016/may/28/eu-ministers-2020-target-free-access-scientific-papers">a rash promise</a></span> that by 2020 all European publicly-funded research would be freely available. Two years out, it has become apparent that Europe will need to take dramatic action if it wants to fulfil its promise – or pay legacy publishers ever larger wads of public money in order to do so. </span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span>One response has been the EC’s announcement that it plans to <span class="MsoHyperlink"><a href="https://etendering.ted.europa.eu/cft/cft-display.html?cftId=3418">build its own publishing platform</a></span>. </span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span>More significantly, hard hitter <span class="MsoHyperlink"><a href="https://ec.europa.eu/epsc/team/robert-jan-smits_e">Robert-Jan Smits</a></span> (“<span class="MsoHyperlink"><a href="https://sciencebusiness.net/framework-programmes/news/eu-research-chiefs-next-act-changing-future-academic-publishing">one of Europe’s most powerful figures in research</a></span>”) has been appointed Senior Advisor on Open Access within the European Political Strategy Centre at the European Commission. His task is to ensure that the 2020 goal is met.</span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span>To that end, Smits is currently working on what has been dubbed <span class="MsoHyperlink"><a href="https://www.scienceeurope.org/making-open-access-a-reality-by-2020">Plan S</a></span>. Strikingly, the signals are that Plan S could see legacy publishers excluded from the solution proposed, or assigned a significantly curtailed role. </span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span>A similar message is coming from Project Deal. In May, for instance, Gerard Meijer, director of the German Fritz-Haber Institute and member of Project Deal <span class="MsoHyperlink"><a href="https://www.scienceguide.nl/2018/05/open-access-negotiators-prepare-for-a-future-without-publishers/">indicated</a></span> that academic publishers may not be included in its future plans. This may be necessary, he said, because “<span class="MsoHyperlink"><span style="color: windowtext;">If we keep moving at this pace, we’ll never reach our goals</span></span>.”</span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span>Much of this may be little more than sabre rattling (we don’t know), but we can surely expect it to focus minds.</span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><div style="text-align: left;"><span>One problem with Europe’s more aggressive stance is that it is seeing it double down on an anti-democratic and authoritarian trend already evident in its push for OA. We have seen, for instance, ever more demanding and oppressive OA mandates imposed on European researchers – a development at its most extreme in the <span class="MsoHyperlink"><a href="https://poynder.blogspot.com/2015/02/open-access-and-research-excellence.html">OA policy</a></span> announced in 2014 by the (former) Higher Education Funding Council for England (<span class="MsoHyperlink"><a href="http://www.hefce.ac.uk/">HEFCE</a></span>). </span></div></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span>There are now also noises being made to the effect that European researchers may have to give up publishing with legacy publishers and begin using “<span class="MsoHyperlink"><a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-05191-0">alternative platforms</a></span>” (presumably platforms like the one planned by the EC). And it has been suggested that researchers who do not make their work OA could be <span class="MsoHyperlink"><a href="https://sciencebusiness.net/framework-programmes/news/eu-research-chiefs-next-act-changing-future-academic-publishing">fined</a></span>.</span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span>As such, Plan S could end up alienating not just publishers, but the people who actually produce the research in question, even as they are told that they will be the main beneficiaries of open access. </span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span>Librarians could also find themselves being sidelined. Smits </span><span lang="EN-US">has </span><span>suggested, for instance, that librarians are acting as a brake on progress. As he <span class="MsoHyperlink"><a href="https://horizon-magazine.eu/article/open-access-scientific-publications-must-become-reality-2020-robert-jan-smits_en.html">put it</a></span>, “They want to preserve the money and power they have to finance the subscriptions to the prestigious journals. They fear that if they don’t have this money anymore, their role will be less important.” </span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span>Since they pride themselves on being the premier OA advocates and leaders of the movement this will feel like a punch in the face for librarians. </span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span>True, the increasingly robust stance Europe is taking in its war with publishers <i>could</i> speed up the transition to OA. But there must be concern that it will cause collateral damage, with researchers and librarians the most likely potential victims.</span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><h3><span lang="EN-US"><span style="font-size: large;">Back in the USA</span></span></h3><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span>What we learn from this is that the most high-profile OA activity today is taking place in Europe. But what about the country that gave us the ground-breaking 2004 <span class="MsoHyperlink"><a href="https://publicaccess.nih.gov/policy.htm">NIH Public Access Policy</a></span>, and the 2008 <span class="MsoHyperlink"><a href="https://osc.hul.harvard.edu/policies/">Harvard OA policy</a></span>? What is the state of play in the US today?</span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span>Certainly, we can see new OA policies regularly rolled out, and these are invariably Harvard-style policies.<a name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">[2]</span></span></span></a> (The Harvard policy model, we could note, is unlike the top-down compulsory ones being imposed on researchers in Europe. Rather, it involves faculty voluntarily agreeing to adopt policies that invariably include a no-questions-asked waiver element).</span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span>We can also see a <span class="MsoHyperlink"><a href="https://www.crossref.org/blog/preprints-growth-rate-ten-times-higher-than-journal-articles/">re-invigorated preprint movement</a></span> gathering pace in the US, in part as a result of the advocacy and technology of the Virginia-based <span class="MsoHyperlink"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Center_for_Open_Science">Center for Open Science</a>, but also, of course, <a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/">bioRxiv</a>, <a href="https://peerj.com/preprints/">PeerJ Preprints</a> etc.</span></span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span>In addition, the long-standing attempts to have OA legislation like <span class="MsoHyperlink"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fair_Access_to_Science_and_Technology_Research_Act">FASTR</a></span> and <span class="MsoHyperlink"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Research_Public_Access_Act">FRPAA</a></span> enacted continue. (With little success to date). </span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span>What we are not seeing in the US, however, is the same determination to take on publishers. This is doubtless in part because academic culture is different in the US, but also because it would be difficult to organise. As Roger Schonfeld has <span class="MsoHyperlink"><a href="https://scholarlykitchen.sspnet.org/2018/06/18/will-european-contagion-spread">pointed out</a></span>, the US university system is not centralised in the way it tends to be in Europe. As such, he says, there is “no national-level common negotiating posture” for dealing with publishers. </span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span>Nevertheless, there is clearly the same desire to move forward with open access, if by different means. And it would seem that the University of California (UC) is keen to take <span class="MsoHyperlink"><a href="https://osc.universityofcalifornia.edu/2018/06/championing-change-in-journal-negotiations/">a leadership role</a></span> in this, judging at least by the range of OA activities and initiatives it is involved in. </span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span>For instance, UC Libraries have been taking part in <span class="MsoHyperlink"><a href="https://www.cdlib.org/cdlinfo/2009/01/22/uc-libraries-and-springer-sign-pilot-agreement-for-open-access-journal-publishing/">OA pilots</a></span> since at least 2009, and since <span class="MsoHyperlink"><a href="https://www.library.ucsf.edu/open-access/policy/">2012</a></span> the University has introduced a series of <span class="MsoHyperlink"><a href="https://osc.universityofcalifornia.edu/open-access-policy/">open access policies</a></span>.</span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span>Then in 2015 <span class="MsoHyperlink"><a href="https://www.ucpress.edu/">UC Press</a></span> launched the OA journal <span class="MsoHyperlink"><a href="https://www.collabra.org/">Collabra</a></span> (Now <i>Collabra: Psychology</i>) and an open access monograph publisher called <span class="MsoHyperlink"><a href="https://www.luminosoa.org/">Luminos</a></span> (some background <span class="MsoHyperlink"><a href="https://poynder.blogspot.com/2015/03/the-oa-interviews-alison-mudditt.html?m=0">here</a></span>).</span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span>A year later (2016), the California Digital Library (<span class="MsoHyperlink"><a href="https://www.cdlib.org/">CDL</a></span>) took part in <span class="MsoHyperlink"><a href="http://icis.ucdavis.edu/?page_id=286">a joint study</a></span> designed to estimate what the institutional costs would be if subscription journals were converted<i> en masse</i> to an entirely APC business model. This was preparatory to proposing a “global flip” strategy in which a largescale conversion of subscription journals to pay-to-publish would be engineered. </span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span>The US study came in the wake of a similar exercise undertaken by the <span class="MsoHyperlink"><a href="https://www.mpdl.mpg.de/en/">Max Planck Digital Library</a></span>. Max Planck concluded that there is already enough money in the system to pay for a large-scale transformation to OA and published its findings in a <span class="MsoHyperlink"><a href="http://pubman.mpdl.mpg.de/pubman/item/escidoc:2148961:7/component/escidoc:2149096/MPDL_OA-Transition_White_Paper.pdf">white paper</a></span> in April 2015.

In February it published <span class="MsoHyperlink"><a href="https://libraries.universityofcalifornia.edu/groups/files/about/docs/UC-Libraries-Pathways%20to%20OA-Report.pdf">Pathways to Open Access</a></span> (some context on this <span class="MsoHyperlink"><a href="http://update.lib.berkeley.edu/2018/07/27/pathways-to-open-access-choices-and-opportunities/">here</a></span>), followed in April by a <span class="MsoHyperlink"><a href="https://senate.universityofcalifornia.edu/_files/committees/ucolasc/scholcommprinciples-20180425.pdf">Declaration of Rights and Principles to Transform Scholarly Communication</a></span>.</span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span>And in June the University published a <span class="MsoHyperlink"><a href="https://osc.universityofcalifornia.edu/2018/06/championing-change-in-journal-negotiations/">Call to Action</a></span> with the stated aim of addressing the “twin challenges of journal affordability and the moral imperative of achieving a truly open scholarly communication system”. </span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span>What does this vision mean in practice, and how will it be achieved? What is the endpoint being worked towards? What, in short, is the University’s current thinking on open access? </span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span>Who better to put these questions to than <span class="MsoHyperlink"><a href="http://www.library.ucla.edu/content/virginia-steel">Virginia Steel</a></span>, the Norman and Armena Powell University Librarian at UCLA, and <span class="MsoHyperlink"><a href="https://sparcopen.org/people/virginia-steel/">Chair of the SPARC Steering Committee</a></span>?</span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><h3><span lang="EN-US"><span style="font-size: large;">Nuanced and undogmatic</span></span></h3><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span>In contrast to many OA advocates in Europe, Steel’s views on open access are nuanced and undogmatic. For this reason, perhaps, she seems to be wary of “big idea” solutions like the global flip. As she puts it, “Succeeding with OA will require multiple models that will vary depending on disciplinary needs and the cultures and scholarly communications models of those disciplines.”</span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span>She also appears to be more independently minded than many OA advocates, and not shy to challenge and question proposals she has doubts about – as evidenced by her decision in 2016 to write <span class="MsoHyperlink"><a href="https://www.library.ucla.edu/sites/default/files/Ginny-Steel_open-letter_OA2020-PIF_October-2016_0.pdf">an open letter to the academic community</a></span> setting out her concerns about the OA2020 Initiative and the notion of a “global flip”.</span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span>Steel’s approach is doubtless partly a product of the more democratic academic culture evident in the US. As a result, discussions about OA tend to major on voluntarism, persuasion and academic freedom, not compulsion, confrontation and punishment, as we see in Europe today.</span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span>Explaining the reasoning behind her more consensual approach Steel says, “Incentivising adherence to OA is better than compelling faculty to comply – the carrot will be better received than the stick – and it’s likely that more faculty will adopt OA practices sooner rather than later if they have a positive reason to do this.”</span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span>Nor does Steel believe we can rush the transition to OA. “[T]urning the scholarly publication system upside down will probably take several decades,” she says, adding that convincing researchers to get on board “requires continued effort to explain, cajole, and convince”. </span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span>The process cannot be hurried, she suggests, not just because it will require a lot of persuasion, but because there is still no consensus on many aspects of open access. As she puts it, “Making content openly available … will take time and discussion since there isn’t consensus on, say, whether or not content should be available for reuse by commercial publishers.”</span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><h3><span><span style="font-size: large;">Risks</span></span></h3><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span>This last point is an important one. It reminds us that there has never been consensus within the OA movement. It is for this reason that funders, universities and governments in Europe have adopted a top-down compulsory approach. The danger of this approach, however, is that it will diminish and erode important academic values, alienate key stakeholders, and maybe even prove counterproductive.</span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span>On the other hand, the more <i>laissez-faire</i> approach we see in the US might mean that by the time a consensus is reached, and by the time researchers have been persuaded in sufficient numbers of the merits of embracing OA, legacy publishers will have so fully embedded themselves into the OA environment, and indeed across the entire research workflow, that it will prove impossible to stand up to them, or even to contemplate doing without their services, whatever they might charge for those services. Such an outcome would mean that any hope of resolving the affordability problem would have to be abandoned, as would any hope of creating the more equitable knowledge infrastructure envisage by BOAI.  </span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span>In conclusion, the vision articulated at BOAI in 2002 has yet to be realised, and there must be doubts that it will be. For sure, we are seeing more research made open access, but it is often <span class="MsoHyperlink"><a href="https://osf.io/uaw27/">a fragile openness</a></span>, and the problem of affordability remains. Most disappointingly, the possibility of COAR’s “sustainable knowledge commons” ever becoming reality looks increasingly unlikely. </span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span>It may be that I take too sceptical a view. but whatever happens, it is unclear to me that the European approach of confrontation and compulsion will prove any more successful than the US emphasis on persuasion and consensus building. And both approaches would seem to come with risks. </span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span>In short, the future is uncertain. In fact, sitting in the middle of the OA revolution as we are, we might even be tempted to think that the outcome will depend as much on luck as on schemes, strategies and plans. Like Pierre Bezukhov wandering around the chaos of the Battle of Borodino in <i>War and Peace</i>, we might have to conclude that the actions of leaders, and of plans and policies, are far less effective than we like to think! </span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: center;"><span lang="EN-US"><b>The interview with Virginia Steel is available in a pdf file <a href="http://www.richardpoynder.co.uk/Interview_ginny_steel.pdf">here</a>. </b></span></div><br /><div><br clear="all" /><hr align="left" size="1" width="33%" /> <br /><div id="ftn1"><div class="MsoFootnoteText"><a name="_ftn1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span lang="EN-US"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span lang="EN-US">[1]</span></span></span></span></a><span lang="EN-US"> “[M]ore documents are freely available in unsustainable sources and/or in violation of their copyright, than through sustainable and legal ways.” <span class="MsoHyperlink"><a href="https://osf.io/uaw27/">https://osf.io/uaw27/</a></span> </span></div></div><div id="ftn2"><div class="MsoFootnoteText"><a name="_ftn2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span lang="EN-US"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span lang="EN-US">[2]</span></span></span></span></a><span lang="EN-US"> </span><span class="MsoHyperlink"><a href="https://cyber.harvard.edu/hoap/Additional_resources">73 universities</a></span> have introduced a Harvard-style OA policy to date, mostly institutions in the US. </div></div></div>

Some rather jaw-dropping corrections for the French martyr saint of research integrity, Catherine Jessus, head of biology branch at the French CNRS, professor of developmental biology at Sorbonne University in Paris. Jessus is the feared CNRS executive whose case divided French academics and even media into loyal Stalinists and enemies of the people, after Sorbonne … <a class="more-link" href="https://forbetterscience.com/2018/08/01/catherine-jessus-case-journals-hide-behind-sorbonne-cope-to-avoid-retractions/">Continue reading <span class="screen-reader-text">Catherine Jessus case: journals hide behind Sorbonne &amp; COPE to avoid retractions</span> <span class="meta-nav">→</span></a>

<p style="font-weight: bold;">Mathematics of the brain: a NeuroMat op-ed</p>
<p style="font-size: 15px;">What does Mathematics have to do with Brain Biology? This is the question that NeuroMat's director, Antonio Galves, asks on his first post as a contributor to the "Science &amp; Mathematics" blog of the Brazilian newspaper <em>O Globo</em>. This post, originally in Portuguese, is brought here in English.

<p>Many commentators considered President Obama’s reversal on same-sex marriage an act of courage. But this isn’t how the public usually perceives moral mind-changers, according to a team led by Tamar Kreps at the University of Utah. <a href="http://psycnet.apa.org/record/2017-25112-001">Their findings</a> in the <i>Journal of Personality and Social Psychology</i> suggest that leaders who shift from a moral stance don’t appear brave – they just look like hypocrites.</p>
<p><span id="more-34380"></span></p>
<p>The researchers conducted 15 studies, of which I’ll focus on one example that illustrates the core approach. Nearly 800 participants recruited from Amazon Mechanical Turk read scenarios where a member of the US Congress took a stance on either the death penalty or same-sex marriage. In some cases, their stance was pragmatic, indicated in their statement through phrases like “it’s a matter of not having to invest in the cost of changing government systems”. In other cases the justification for the stance was moral – “it’s a matter of justice.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Participants rated their initial feelings about the politician and then learned that he or she had since changed their tune, again making a statement based on either pragmatic or moral reasons. For example, a statement might read “It’s still a moral issue for me…I’ve realized, though, that we can never be 100 per cent certain that the convicted party is guilty, and truly defending justice means never taking the risk of killing an innocent victim.” Finally, participants rated the politicians again.</p>
<p>When their initial stance was moral rather than pragmatic, the political leaders suffered costs and gained no benefits after changing their moral mind. Participants rated them as less effective, less worthy of support and more hypocritical, with the intensity of hypocrisy driving the other two negative judgments. Even those participants who agreed with moral mind-changers’ new position saw them as hypocritical, although slightly less so than other participants. At the same time, moral mind changers were seen as no more courageous, effective, or worthy of support, compared to the congress men and women who changed their initial pragmatically grounded position.</p>
<p>Kreps’s team found this same effect in various scenarios, including a manager deciding whether to take on an environmentally friendly supply system, politicians considering immigration reform, and business leaders considering whether to use sex to sell their products. One study used stimuli that more closely resembled real life through “attack ads” accusing an opponent of flip-flopping. Although not all of the 15 studies produced significant effects, a meta-analysis across all the data, involving nearly 6,000 participants, suggested a strong level of support for the core findings (a few non-significant studies were entirely to be expected given the size of the effect was modest).</p>
<p>The results suggest that abandoning a moral position will almost certainly cost you. Changing a key belief may put you at odds with friends and family and be seized on by your enemies, casting you as a commitment-breaker – as dishonest or inauthentic for sacrificing what you had said was a sacred cow (and all the more so if changing one’s moral position for pragmatic reasons, according to the studies that looked at this reason for change).</p>
<p>However, one final study provided a “glimmer of hope” for evolving moral leaders. When participants heard that the leader’s moral shift was triggered by a transformative event, such as spending time with a death row inmate, they remained critical in terms of hypocrisy, but simultaneously rated them as more courageous.</p>
<p>Much of the leadership literature to date has suggested there are only benefits to expressing moral positions, making this one of the first studies to show a potential downside, and – if leaders have an instinct for the effects shown here – it could explain why they are often keen to hold back from taking moral positions. Kreps and her colleagues conclude that “moral talk is not cheap – those who deviate from their initial moral views pay a price…and leaders may do well to avoid it in the absence of true, enduring conviction.”</p>
