                <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/black-researchers-diversity-equity-science-stem">Meet 5 Black researchers fighting for diversity and equity in science</a></h4>

<p class="has-drop-cap has-medium-font-size">As the Black Lives Matter movement gained momentum this year, Black scientists jumped in to call for inclusivity at school and work. </p>



<p class="has-normal-font-size">Within days of the news that a Black bird watcher, Christian Cooper, had been harassed in New York City’s Central Park, the <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/blackbirdersweek-birding-while-black-nature-enthusiasts">social media campaign #BlackBirdersWeek was launched</a> (<em>SN Online: 6/4/20</em>), followed closely by <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/blackinneuro">#BlackInNeuro</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/BlackinSciComm">#BlackInSciComm</a> and many others.</p>



<p>Young scientists led many of these efforts to make change happen. <em>Science News</em> talked with some of these new leaders, as well as a few researchers who have been pushing for diversity in the sciences for years and see new opportunities for progress.</p>



<p><em>The following conversations have been edited for length and clarity.</em></p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator" />



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="alignleft size-full"><img alt="Deja Perkins birding and looking through a telescope on a tripode" class="wp-image-3094352" height="680" src="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/121920_ye_blackinstem_perkins-2.jpg" width="680" /><span class="caption wp-caption-3094352"><br />Deja Perkins</span><span class="credit wp-credit-3094352">Jason Ward</span></figure></div>



<h4>Deja Perkins</h4>



<p><strong>Urban ecologist</strong><br />North Carolina State University<br />President, <a href="https://twitter.com/blackafinstem">BlackAFinSTEM</a><br />Co-organizer, <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/BlackBirdersWeek">#BlackBirdersWeek</a></p>





<p><strong>What prompted you to act?</strong></p>



<p>After the May 25 incident that happened to Christian Cooper, Anna Gifty, another member of BlackAFinSTEM [a collective of Black professionals working across STEM fields], thought that it would be wise to <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/blackbirdersweek-birding-while-black-nature-enthusiasts">highlight other Black birders</a>. BlackAFinSTEM organized a week of events within about 48 hours. It was a good way to capture the momentum and bring attention to the experience of Black people outdoors. Any one of us could have been Christian Cooper. A lot of BlackAFinSTEM members have experienced racism in the field or have had negative experiences with the police.</p>



<p><strong>What makes this year’s diversity initiatives different?</strong></p>



<p>The collective effort of all of these events — <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/blackhikersweek">#BlackHikersWeek</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/BlackBotanistsWeek">#BlackBotanistsWeek</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/BlackInNationalParks">#BlackInNationalParks</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/BlackInNeuroWeek">#BlackInNeuroWeek</a> — is bringing more attention to the murders and harassment of Black people who are carrying out everyday tasks. These initiatives are making it easier for people who want to hop on board and make a difference.</p>



<p><strong>Have you seen immediate effects?</strong></p>



<p>Some organizations quickly responded to break down some of the barriers that prevent Black and Indigenous people from entering into the environmental space. The Free Binoculars for Black Birders campaign provided binoculars to anyone who identified as Black and wanted a pair of binoculars, and a similar campaign launched specifically for kids. Some organizations, such as the Wilson Ornithological Society, offered free memberships. And we have seen an increase in organizations reaching out to BlackAFinSTEM to hire some of our members for presentations, workshops and program development.</p>



<p><strong>What could get in the way of lasting change?</strong></p>



<p>One barrier I can foresee is gatekeeping. It’s still on a lot of organizations, nonprofits and government agencies to hire qualified Black professionals. Those groups hold the power for change, and so they have to take the initiative to hire qualified individuals.</p>



<p>With #BlackBirdersWeek and BlackAFinSTEM, we have been creating our own table to get more people engaged and involved in the outdoors. But we can only do so much. It really comes down to partnerships, working with other established organizations to continue to make change. — <em>Carolyn Wilke</em></p>

<h4>Raven Baxter</h4>



<p><strong>Science education graduate student</strong> <br />University at Buffalo<br /><a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCqRkU0Z4V6UjDKnbc5brl8A">Raven the Science Maven</a> on YouTube<br />Founder, <a href="https://twitter.com/BlackInSciComm">@BlackInSciComm</a></p>



<p><strong>What prompted you to act?</strong></p>



<p>I founded #BlackInSciComm out of the need for Black voices in the science space. This year has been very hard for many, but particularly for Black people. And we’ve been feeling like Black science communicators have been using their voices advocating for racial justice and for their lives and for their freedom. That comes at a great price. They are sacrificing their voices in science to make sure that people understand that their lives matter. And, you know, that shouldn’t even have to be the case.</p>



<p><strong>What makes this year’s diversity initiatives different?</strong></p>



<p>We saw the importance of owning our own narrative. That’s why we’re seeing so many “Black in X” movements. Everybody is unique and doing special work. It should all be celebrated.</p>



<p><strong>What long-term effects do you envision?</strong></p>



<p>I think it’s going to be amazing for future generations. One of the biggest issues that marginalized folks have is imposter syndrome — the product of not feeling like you belong because you don’t see anybody like you in your field. So you’re doing well and you’re succeeding, but you feel like you’re an imposter because the narrative that’s been pushed for so long is that we’re not in these fields or that we don’t do well in these fields. But that’s not true.</p>



<p><strong>How do this year’s efforts make you feel?</strong></p>



<p>We’re setting roots that spread a message that Black people do belong in things, and building up new generations of STEM professionals. I can tell that people want to support and amplify Black voices and invest in the community and it’s so cool. I just feel very loved, and I feel like we are giving love. — <em>Bethany Brookshire</em></p>

<h4>Brian Nord</h4>



<p><strong>Cosmologist</strong><br />Fermilab<br />Co-organizer, <a href="https://www.particlesforjustice.org/">Strike for Black Lives</a><br /><br /><strong>What prompted you to act?</strong></p>



<p>In early June, Chanda Prescod-Weinstein of the University of New Hampshire and I initiated the Strike for Black Lives. The Particles for Justice collective, a group of scientists who originally convened to condemn sexism in STEM, organized and promoted the strike very quickly.</p>



<p>I had worked for a long time within the institutionally paved pathways to make change, and I tried to make new pathways. But, when I looked around, I saw promises unkept and much work to be done. For years, there’s been way too few Black faculty in physics plus too little investment by academic institutions in Black communities. And there’s been little to no accountability for racist and misogynist behavior that drives Black people away from research. It’s time for these things to end. We needed to do something different.</p>



<p><strong>What was the aim of the June 10 Strike for Black Lives?</strong></p>



<p>The core objective was for non-Black scientists to stop doing science for a day and invest their time into building an antiracist, just research environment. For Black scientists and other academics, the day was intended for rest or doing the work they may not have otherwise had time to do. Often, when I spend time fighting racism in STEM, this is time that I don’t spend doing research or with family. That’s time that my white colleagues have to get research done.</p>



<p>I have the privilege to explore nature, to investigate and extend the edge of knowledge. How many more [people] have wanted to do this but have been denied the opportunity? I’m here to imagine and learn how the universe works. I’m also here to imagine and build just research communities, where Black people have the opportunity to pursue their cosmic dreams.</p>



<p><strong>Have you seen any immediate effects from the strike?</strong></p>



<p>I’ve seen many scientists begin to invest time in the study of racism, white supremacy, misogyny, and begin to observe how these forces permeate society — including the scientific community — to disenfranchise Black people and other people of color. I’ve also seen scientists begin to take action to deflate or confront these forces, and to start creating a just research environment. — <em>Maria Temming</em></p>

<h4>Angeline Dukes</h4>



<p><strong>Neuroscience graduate student</strong><br />University of California, Irvine<br />Founder and president, <a href="https://twitter.com/BlackInNeuro">@BlackInNeuro</a></p>



<p><strong>What prompted you to act?</strong></p>



<p>A lot of it was being one of two Black women in my department. It’s very isolating. Thank God I have her to talk to. But a lot of other Black students in neuroscience don’t even have that.</p>



<p>And we don’t have any Black faculty in our department. It’s not like we have someone who understands what it’s like to be a Black person and to be witnessing these brutal murders and all this police brutality. It’s emotionally and mentally draining, but we still have to be in the lab. And of course, it’s still a pandemic. There is so much going on.</p>



<p>Having a community who just gets it, and understands exactly what we’re going through and can support and uplift and just be there for us, is a major driving force in #BlackInNeuro. There are people out there who care about you and understand your experiences without you having to explain why you feel this way.</p>



<p><strong>What initiative did you launch?</strong></p>



<p>It started with <a href="https://twitter.com/FutureDrDukes/status/1279181446108770305">a tweet</a>: “Sooo when are we doing #BlackInNeuro week?” I didn’t expect to get a huge response. I didn’t have a huge following on Twitter. But a lot of people were very interested.</p>



<p>The same night I sent the tweet out, we made a Slack channel. We had about 22 people join. That was on Friday. By Sunday we had our first meeting. In about three weeks, we had organized the whole week [July 27 to August 2].</p>



<p>We got speakers and panelists from different career stages to talk about their experiences. We used hashtags to plan events and different ways of highlighting and amplifying Black voices and Black research and Black people in neuroscience-related fields. We want this to be a lasting thing. One week isn’t nearly enough for us to actually make a continuous change.</p>



<p><strong>What makes #BlackInNeuro have such potential?</strong></p>



<p>It is led by Black people for Black people. We are mostly graduate students and postdocs, so it’s a trainee-led initiative. There aren’t a lot of Black people in faculty positions. There are more of us at the graduate level. We have the energy and the drive to build a community and hopefully retain more of us in these fields so we can get those faculty positions.</p>



<p><strong>What long-term effects do you envision?</strong></p>



<p>The Society for Neuroscience meeting was canceled because of COVID. Black trainees would have used that as an opportunity to present their research. We held a mini-conference in late October to have a space for them to get that presentation experience and networking experience and professional development workshops.</p>



<p><strong>How did this year’s efforts make you feel?</strong></p>



<p>We did a #BlackInNeuro roll call [an invitation for people to share their own stories on social media]. What was really nice about that was seeing all the different Black neuroscientists, Black neuroengineers. Just seeing that there were so many Black people in this field was amazing to me.</p>



<p>We had a [virtual] social for Black women in neuro. It meant the world to me to be able to connect in that way with so many other Black women. I got to see them as people and not just names on paper. The whole week, I really loved all of it. — <em>Laura Sanders</em></p>

<h4>Gary Hoover</h4>



<p><strong>Economist</strong><br />University of Oklahoma<br />Cochair, Committee on the Status of Minority Groups in the Economics Profession, American Economic Association</p>



<p><strong>What initiative have you been involved with?</strong></p>



<p>For the last eight years, I have served as cochair of the Committee on the Status of Minority Groups in the Economics Profession. As such, I see all the data on minority representation and the number of minorities that we have in our field. That number always has been really, really low. In fact, economics has a lower percentage of minorities, or at least Blacks, than does pure mathematics. That is damning.</p>



<p>In early 2019, the American Economic Association sent out a survey about the state of our profession. The results showed that women and minorities didn’t feel good about things. My committee cochairs Ebonya Washington, Amanda Bayer and I realized that the survey only included people in the profession. For our survey, appearing in the Summer 2020 <em>Journal of Economic Perspectives</em>, we <a href="https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/jep.34.3.193">found people who had left the profession</a> by looking at former participants in a decades-old summer program aimed at training undergraduates for careers in economics. Minority students didn’t always feel welcomed into the field. They weren’t told, “This is a big tent and there’s room for you here in this profession.”</p>



<p><strong>What prompted you to act?</strong></p>



<p>My first job out of graduate school was at the University of Alabama. I was the first Black tenure-track faculty member hired in the business school. Once I received tenure, around 2003, the university made me the assistant dean for faculty and graduate student development. My job was to recruit and retain Black faculty. By the time I left that job in 2014, the University of Alabama business school had more Black faculty and graduate students than all the other schools in the Southeast Conference combined. Since I left, those numbers have fallen off, which shows that we need active recruitment.</p>



<p><strong>What makes this year’s diversity initiatives different?</strong></p>



<p>Right after things blew up this summer with George Floyd’s death, the American Economic Association put out a statement about how much diversity and inclusiveness matters in our profession. Myself and Ebonya Washington, we said to them, “Statements aren’t enough. What are you going to do?”</p>



<p>We went to them with <a href="https://www.aeaweb.org/resources/brochures/2020/diversity">five actionable items</a>, now permanent and annual parts of the American Economic Association initiatives for diversity and inclusion. One of the initiatives presents opportunities for underrepresented minorities to meet with a high-ranking person in the economics profession. We are talking about Ben Bernanke–type names, really high-profile economists. We succeeded because we went to the executive board with proposals already in hand.</p>



<p><strong>What change would you like to see?</strong></p>



<p>As economists, we know that if you want to change people’s behavior, you need incentives. For instance, we tell people they won’t get tenure if they don’t have a certain level and quantity of publications. That’s clearly written out and people know that and they respond by producing the quantity and quality of publications that are necessary. Why don’t we have that for diversity? If a school wants to diversify its econ department, it can say to the chair: “Your tenure status, your raises, your promotion are all tied to how well your department diversifies.” We can get what we’re looking for. It’s economics. It’s what we do. It works.</p>



<p><strong>What is lost when minority voices aren’t at the table?</strong></p>



<p>Policy makers come to economists for advice. But when you’ve got a sizable portion of your labor force of economists sitting it out because the climate isn’t inviting for them, then you can’t give good advice. What’s going to happen next is policy makers are going to start going to the fields that do give more inclusive advice. We’re just going to get left behind. — <em>Sujata Gupta</em></p>

<p class="has-drop-cap has-medium-font-size">Nationwide protests in response to the police killings of George Floyd, Breonna Taylor and other unarmed Black men and women in the first part of 2020 inspired calls to action within academia’s ivory tower. </p>



<p class="has-normal-font-size">Social media movements such as #BlackInSTEM brought attention to discrimination faced by Black students and professionals throughout the science, technology, engineering and mathematics pipelines. U.S. Black residents studying and working in STEM fields are underrepresented at every level, from undergraduate degree programs to the workforce.</p>



<aside class="wp-block-sciencenews-inline-related-post alignleft"><h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/?p=3094347">Meet 5 Black researchers fighting for diversity and equity in science</a></h4></aside>



<p>The academic environment fails to support Black students, says economist Gary Hoover of the University of Oklahoma in Norman. “Black students in STEM are some of the most talented people around, and if the environment isn’t going to be welcoming, these folks just take their talents elsewhere.”</p>





<p>More U.S. students are getting science and engineering degrees than ever before. But the gap for Black students in these fields has been stubbornly wide, as population-adjusted figures show. In 2018, the most recent year for which data are available, about 238 of every 100,000 U.S. residents earned a STEM bachelor’s degree. If the Black community was adequately represented in STEM higher education, its rate would be similar – 238 of every 100,000 Black residents would have earned these degrees. Yet only 161 of every 100,000 Black residents had done so.</p>

</div>



<p>The gap continues into graduate school. In 2018, Black residents were 12.3 percent of the U.S. population, but only 8.4 percent of bachelor’s graduates, 8.3 percent of master’s graduates and 5.5 percent of doctoral graduates.</p>

<h3>U.S. Black students in STEM, 2000–2018</h3>



<p>From 2000 to 2018, the rising number of Black students in U.S. STEM degree programs mirrored the upward trend of STEM students overall, but the representation gap held firm. Displaying the graduation figures by population makes clear that Black students are earning STEM degrees at lower levels than Black people are represented in the overall U.S. population. If their graduation figures aligned with their population representation, the yellow lines would be right up there with the blue lines.</p>

<p>As Black STEM students make their way up the academic ladder, they may face learning and research environments that are unsupportive or actively hostile. In a 2018-2019 <a href="https://www.aip.org/sites/default/files/aipcorp/files/teamup-full-report.pdf">study by the American Institute of Physics</a>, Black students in physics reported that they commonly experienced a lack of financial support, as well as microaggressions, small interactions in which peers or superiors question a person’s presence or performance due to racially charged bias. These experiences negatively affected the person’s sense of belonging in the field. The study results were based on a survey of 232 students, 53 percent of whom identified as Black or Black biracial. In the survey, 42 percent of the Black physics students reported that their department creates a supportive environment “most times,” compared with 53 percent of their white colleagues. Four percent of the Black students reported that their department “never” creates a supportive environment; none of the white students selected this response.</p>



<p>“As I reflect on my own academic journey… there were fewer and fewer Black students in my programs,” says anthropologist Stephanie Poindexter of the University of Buffalo in New York. Poindexter was one of very few Black students studying primates in her undergraduate program, and representation narrowed further as she progressed to a Ph.D. “What I see is a lot of untapped potential,” Poindexter days: “interested students of color who are not fostered into higher degrees in the same way that other students are fostered.”</p>



<p>Within the U.S. STEM workforce, Black scientists are also underrepresented, as are Hispanic or Latino and Native American scientists, according to 2017 data.</p>



<div class="wp-block-sciencenews-content-sidebar alignwide">
<h3>U.S. STEM employment by race and ethnicity, 2017</h3>



<p>In 2017, Black residents, Hispanic or Latino residents and Native Americans and Alaskan Natives were severely underrepresented among U.S. scientists, engineers and health care professionals, when compared with the overall populations for these identities.</p>



<div style="width: 100%!; text-align: right!important;"><a class="flourish-credit" href="https://public.flourish.studio/visualisation/4615602/?utm_source=embed&amp;utm_campaign=visualisation/4615602" rel="noopener noreferrer" style="text-decoration: none!important;" target="_top"><img alt="Made with Flourish" src="https://public.flourish.studio/resources/made_with_flourish.svg" style="width: 105px!important; height: 16px!important;" /> </a></div>
</div>



<p>Among 11 STEM professions reviewed by the National Center for Science and Engineering Statistics, or NCSES, only one field demonstrates a rate of Black representation that is close to  the overall population: 92 of every 100,000 Black residents are social scientists, compared with 122 of every 100,000 U.S. residents overall.</p>



<div class="wp-block-sciencenews-content-sidebar alignwide">
<h3>STEM employment for U.S. Black residents by field, 2017</h3>



<p>All major STEM fields in the United States have Black representation rates (yellow bars) far below the overall rates of U.S. working professionals (blue). </p>



<div style="width: 100%!; text-align: right!important;"><a class="flourish-credit" href="https://public.flourish.studio/visualisation/4615786/?utm_source=embed&amp;utm_campaign=visualisation/4615786" rel="noopener noreferrer" style="text-decoration: none!important;" target="_top"><img alt="Made with Flourish" src="https://public.flourish.studio/resources/made_with_flourish.svg" style="width: 105px!important; height: 16px!important;" /> </a></div>
</div>



<p>The disparity is especially severe in engineering. For example, 29 of every 100,000 U.S. residents are chemical engineers compared with 2 of every 1000,000 Black residents. </p>



<p>“Young Black potential engineers have few role models that look like them and/or come from similar backgrounds that they can emulate, manifesting in a deficit in the younger students cultivating these skills,” says Aaron Kyle, senior lecturer in biomedical engineering design at Columbia University’s Fu Foundation School of Engineering and Applied Science. Kyle also notes that minority scientists may be cited less than their peers, leading to challenges in career advancement.</p>



<div class="wp-block-sciencenews-content-sidebar alignwide">
<h3>Engineering employment for U.S. Black residents, 2017</h3>



<p>Among U.S. engineers (blue bars), Black representation (yellow) is lowest in chemical engineering. If Black professionals were represented equally, the yellow and blue bars would be the same length.</p>



<div style="width: 100%!; text-align: right!important;"><a class="flourish-credit" href="https://public.flourish.studio/visualisation/4616161/?utm_source=embed&amp;utm_campaign=visualisation/4616161" rel="noopener noreferrer" style="text-decoration: none!important;" target="_top"><img alt="Made with Flourish" src="https://public.flourish.studio/resources/made_with_flourish.svg" style="width: 105px!important; height: 16px!important;" /> </a></div>
</div>



<p>Disparities in salary are found in most, but not all, STEM fields. Computer science has the largest disparity, with a median annual salary in 2017 of $97,000 for white professionals compared with $72,000 for Black professionals. There are so few working Black mathematicians that the NCSES couldn’t even make a comparison.</p>



<p>Black scientists in the biological and social sciences, on the other hand, have higher median salaries than their white colleagues. Perhaps, Hoover says, some social sciences, such as political science, may be “more readily able and willing to embrace issues around ethnicity, race and inclusion” than other fields, allowing Black scientists to negotiate more equitable pay.</p>



<div class="wp-block-sciencenews-content-sidebar alignwide">
<h3>Median STEM salaries by field for Black scientists, 2017</h3>



<p>Once employed, U.S. Black STEM graduates tend to be paid less than colleagues from other racial backgrounds, according to 2017 data. The biological and social sciences are an exception.</p>



<div style="width: 100%!; text-align: right!important;"><a class="flourish-credit" href="https://public.flourish.studio/visualisation/4616269/?utm_source=embed&amp;utm_campaign=visualisation/4616269" rel="noopener noreferrer" style="text-decoration: none!important;" target="_top"><img alt="Made with Flourish" src="https://public.flourish.studio/resources/made_with_flourish.svg" style="width: 105px!important; height: 16px!important;" /> </a></div>
</div>



<p>When Black students shift to other tracks, Black communities suffer from a lack of doctors, researchers and engineers who directly understand their experiences and needs. The loss leads to blind spots in innovation, Kyle says.</p>



<p>“We see clear examples of this, ranging from facial recognition software not accurately identifying Black faces all the way through race-based health care disparities: COVID-19 mortality, elevated maternal [death] in Black women, higher amputation levels amongst Black diabetics,” he says. For instance, <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/health/2020/08/19/black-babies-more-likely-live-when-treated-black-doctors-study/3389521001/">the mortality rate for Black newborns was cut in half</a> <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/black-newborn-baby-survival-doctor-race-mortality-rate-disparity">when the babies were cared for by Black doctors</a>, according to a recent report in the <em>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences</em> (<em>SN: 8/25/20</em>).</p>



<p>To improve Black representation in science, Poindexter, Hoover and Kyle all say that solutions must include new offerings of grants, promotions and other research programs dedicated to supporting Black STEM students from elementary school into the workforce. “There needs to be a concentrated effort and financial commitment to balance the scales in the next one to five years,” Poindexter says.</p>

<h3>Methodology</h3>



<p>All data are sourced from the National Science Foundation’s <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/statistics/data.cfm">National Center for Science and Engineering Statistics (NCSES)</a>. Data in “U.S. Black students in STEM, 2000–2018”come from the Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System, an annual survey conducted by the National Center for Education Statistics. IPEDS changed its definition of a doctoral degree in 2008: prior to 2008, our doctoral degree numbers reflect the sum of IPEDS’ “Doctor’s degree (old degree classification)” and “First-professional degree (old degree classification)” figures. Graduation numbers for students identifying as Black and total students are compared against overall U.S. population data, sourced from the <a href="https://data.census.gov/cedsci/table?q=demographic&amp;tid=ACSDP1Y2018.DP05&amp;hidePreview=true">Census’ American Community Survey 1-year estimates</a> from 2010 to 2018 and from the <a href="https://www.census.gov/data/tables/time-series/demo/popest/intercensal-2000-2010-national.html">Census Bureau’s National Intercensal Tables</a> from 2000 to 2009. The science and engineering fields represented in that graph include: Agriculture, Natural Resources and Conservation, Computer and Information Systems, Engineering, Biological and Biomedical Sciences, Mathematics and Statistics, Psychology and Health Professions. Both survey data and Census data include all U.S. residents (citizens and non-citizens).</p>



<p>Data in “U.S. STEM employment by race and ethnicity” and “STEM employment for U.S. Black residents”come from the NCSES’ most recent <a href="https://ncses.nsf.gov/pubs/nsf19304/data">Women, Minorities and Persons with Disabilities in Science and Engineering</a> report, released in 2019. Employment data are found in the charts labeled “Median annual salary of scientists and engineers employed full time,” and are as of 2017. Employment numbers for working STEM professionals, both overall and identifying in different race and ethnicity categories, are compared against overall U.S. population data, sourced from the Census’ American Community Survey 1-year estimates for 2017. Salary data are from in the charts labeled “Median annual salary of scientists and engineers employed full time,” and are as of 2017. These data are weighted estimates based on surveys of 61.2 million individuals under age 76 who have a bachelor’s or higher degree and are living in the United States. Figures for this story focused on data describing those who have a science and engineering or related degree and/or occupation.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/cricket-leaf-song-speakers-male-mating-call-competition">Small, quiet crickets turn leaves into megaphones to blare their mating call</a></h4>

<p>The rules of the tree cricket world, sexually speaking, are simple.</p>



<p>Perched from a leaf’s edge, males call out into the night by rhythmically rubbing their wings. Females survey the soundscape, gravitating towards the loudest and largest males. Small, quiet types get drowned out.</p>



<p>Unless they cheat the system.</p>



<p>Some male crickets make their own megaphones by cutting wing-sized holes into the center of leaves. With their bodies stuck halfway through this vegetative speaker, male <em>Oecanthus henryi </em>crickets can more than double the volume of their calls, <a href="http://rspb.royalsocietypublishing.org/lookup/doi/10.1098/rspb.2020.2229">allowing naturally quiet males to attract as many females as loud males</a>, researchers report December 16 in <em>Proceedings of the Royal Society B</em>.</p>





<p>It’s a rare example of insect tool use that “really challenges you to think about what it takes to produce complex behavior,” says Marlene Zuk, an evolutionary biologist at the University of Minnesota in St. Paul who wasn’t involved in the study.</p>





<p>Biologists first spotted crickets creating leaf-speakers, <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/255142a0">called baffles</a>, and singing from them, or baffling, in 1975. Since then, the baffling behavior has been reported in two other species, but wasn’t clear exactly how it benefits individual crickets.</p>



<p>Rittik Deb, an evolutionary ecologist at the National Centre for Biological Sciences in Bangalore, India, was stunned when he first witnessed an <em>O. henryi </em>male baffling. “It was mind-bogglingly beautiful,” he says, “I had to understand why it was happening.”</p>



<p>Deb and his colleagues first looked for any commonalities among crickets who use baffles. Only 25 out of 463, or 5 percent, of crickets observed and individually marked at field sites outside Bangalore were seen baffling. On average, baffling males were smaller, and called more quietly when not baffling. In the field, Deb found that baffling approximately doubles the volume of a quiet male’s call, raising them to the level of the most attractive males.</p>



<p>Cricket wings are <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/tree-cricket-song-has-note-variability">essentially resonance structures</a>, reverberating with the vibration caused by rubbing, sort of like the body of a violin (<em>SN: 4/30/12</em>). When bafflers crawl through a hole in a leaf, align their wings with the leaf and start to sing, they’re essentially expanding this resonance structure, using the leaf “a bit like a loudspeaker or a megaphone,” Deb says.</p>



<p>Do females fall for their inflated calls? Yes, according to lab experiments. When given a choice, females overwhelmingly prefer louder calls, even when these come from baffling males. Baffling essentially evens the playing field, allowing quiet males to attract just as many females as louder males.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img alt="two tree crickets mating" class="wp-image-3094635" height="439" src="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/121520_jl_crickets_inline1.jpg" width="680" /><span class="caption wp-caption-3094635">During mating, a male <em>Oecanthus henryi </em>tree cricket (right) transfers a sperm-filled spermatophore (white ball hanging from the female, left). How much sperm a female accepts from a male depends on how long she retains the spermatophore. Research shows that otherwise less preferred males can increase the amount of sperm a female accepts by artificially amplifying their call using a leaf, a behavior known as baffling.</span><span class="credit wp-credit-3094635">Rittik Deb</span></figure>



<p>The benefits of baffling don’t stop there. </p>



<p>The climax of cricket mating is the transfer of the spermatophore, a protein ball packed with sperm. Females dictate how much sperm they accept by how long they retain the spermatophore. With larger males, it’s about 40 minutes, compared with only 10 minutes for small males. But when Deb artificially boosted the calls of small and quiet males, females treated them like large males, retaining their spermatophores for longer. “That really surprised us,” Deb says. “It’s as though the females are in some sense being deceived.”</p>



<p>It’s unclear why females don’t seem to notice that they’re mating with a smaller male, though it’s not necessarily surprising. “They’re not wrapping their little arms around males to see whether they’re big or small,” Zuk says. “Maybe there’s something in the song that signals ‘go ahead and have more of this guy’s babies.’” </p>



<p>Whatever the mechanism, <em>O. henryi </em>males have evolved a remarkably effective mating strategy, Zuk says. The behavior appears to be innate, not learned, as lab-raised crickets of all sizes can make and use baffles when given leaves. “It makes me really want to know why such a small portion of males actually do this,” Zuk says.</p>



<p>Baffling might not be worth the extra work for larger males that can already attract plenty of females. But there are many small and quiet males who could presumably reap huge rewards by baffling, but don’t. Perhaps the crickets face a shortage of big enough leaves, or maybe baffling males face a trade-off: With their antennae blocked by the leaf, baffling could make crickets sitting ducks for predators such as geckos and spiders to attack from behind.</p>



<p>Despite potential costs, it’s clear these crickets have evolved a clever way of bending the natural world to their interests. Such tool use among animals is varied, from <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/capuchin-monkey-stone-tool-use-evolution-3000-years">primates cracking nuts with stones</a> to <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/stick-toting-puffins-offer-first-evidence-tool-use-seabirds">puffins scratching themselves with sticks</a> (<em>SN: 6/24/19;SN: 12/30/19</em>). While some biologists may quibble with designating a baffle as a bona fide tool, these crickets show that sophisticated behaviors aren’t just for big, complex brains. “It really turns that idea on its head,” Deb says.</p>

<p><em>By</em> <a href="https://emmayoung.net/">Emma Young</a></p>



<p>Awe, compassion, love, gratitude… research papers and media stories about these emotions abound. Indeed, the past decade has seen an explosion in work on positive emotions — essentially, emotions that involve pleasant rather than unpleasant feelings. However, very little has been done to explore which distinct feelings, thoughts and motivations characterise each one, argue Aaron Weidman and Jessica Tracy at the University of British Columbia. In a <a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2019-54608-001">new paper</a> in <em>Emotion, </em>they report their detailed investigation into these subjective experiences — an investigation that has led them to drop some commonly accepted positive emotions from their master list.</p>



<span id="more-41050"></span>



<p>Weidman and Tracy began with 18 positive emotions, all of which had been studied in recent papers. These were: admiration, amusement, attachment love, awe, compassion, contentment, empathy, enthusiasm, gratitude, happiness, hope, interest, love, nurturant love, romantic love, schadenfreude, sympathy and tenderness. (Pride has been studied down to the level of its subjective elements in work previously led by Tracy, so wasn’t included in the new research.)</p>



<p>The pair sorted these emotions into five thematic groups: “other-appreciation” (e.g. gratitude), caring (e.g. empathy, compassion), enjoyment (e.g. happiness, contentment) and loving. A total of 150 undergraduate students were each presented with one of the five groups and asked to report up to 10 subjective “elements” of each emotion in that group. For example, participants wrote “I felt concern for someone” as a subjective element of sympathy, and listed “I was on top the world” as an element of enthusiasm.</p>



<p>By identifying elements that seemed to best capture unique aspects of each emotion, the pair whittled more than 1,000 frequently experienced subjective elements to a list of 475, covering the five thematic groups. A fresh batch of participants were then asked to reflect on how they had felt during a given emotion, and to identify elements that best matched those feelings from the relevant group list. Using their responses, Weidman and Tracy homed in on yet smaller lists of elements that best matched each individual emotion.</p>



<p>However, it was not possible to create a distinct set of elements for every emotion. In one striking example, no unique element stood out to separate “compassion” from “empathy” and “tenderness” — and so compassion was dropped from their list of positive emotions. Neither could the pair clearly differentiate between the subjective elements of “happiness” and “contentment”, which went into the next round as “happiness/contentment”. “Love” also failed to make the cut, because it was not distinguishable from its sub-types, which had their own unique elements — in fact, Weidman and Tracy found clear support for a sub-type of “attachment love” (involving a close, secure bond with someone), as well as “nurturant love” (more to do with being dedicated to helping someone else to grow) and “romantic love”.</p>



<p>To shrink the element lists to a number practical for use in a scale — and also in a bid to check for agreement between people from different backgrounds — the pair then recruited a fresh batch of more than 1,000 participants. This group comprised men and women who identified as White or East Asian, and who were born either in the US or Canada or in another country. As in the second study, they were asked to rate how relevant various elements were to each emotion.</p>



<p>The researchers found that the six participant groups tended to agree about their subjective experiences of the now 15 emotions. They then used a statistical technique to prune their responses into the final product: 5- to 8-item self-report scales for each of these positive emotions.</p>



<p>The pair argue that their work has various implications. Firstly, though they did find some overlap between elements associated with the different emotions (which will need investigating further), the work supports the relatively modern idea that we experience a range of discrete positive emotions. Also, the research supports the argument that love is not a unitary construct.</p>



<p>Some of their other conclusions will be more controversial, however. For example “happiness” and “contentment” are often conceptualised as distinct emotions, but this is not what they concluded. Neither did they find support for the idea that “joy” and “elation” are independent, discrete emotions — items that reflected both these concepts fell readily under the “happiness/contentment” heading. The loss of “compassion” from the list of positive emotions will be contentious, too.</p>



<p>The new scales clearly need more testing — and it’s important to note that all the participants, no matter where they were born, were living in the US or Canada, which limits generalisability. However, one of the problems with existing work on positive emotions is that different teams often use different measures, making it hard to compare results. If these scales can be accepted, they will help to make work in the field more standardised.</p>



<p>The pair certainly acknowledge that there’s much still to be done, however: “We hope that this work marks a first step in the development of a taxonomy of subjectively experienced positive emotions,” they write — “a model of exactly how many positive emotions are experienced as subjectively distinct, as well as the distinguishing set of subjective elements, causal antecedents, and functional consequences that characterize each of these states.” </p>

<p>A massive tower of smoke generated by Australian wildfires in late 2019 set a new record for the loftiest and largest fire-spawned thunderstorms ever measured. It also may represent a <a href="https://www.agu.org/fall-meeting/events/pe-fm20-09-wildfire-thunderstorms-press-conference?m-search-result=Australian%20wildfires%20inject%20a%20volcanic-scale%20smoke%20plume%20into%20the%20stratosphere">new class of volcanic-scale “pyrocumulonimbus” events</a>, scientists said in an online news conference December 11 at the American Geophysical Union’s fall meeting.</p>



<p>A particularly intense spate of fires in southeastern Australia during the country’s 2019–2020 “Black Summer” <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/australia-wildfires-climate-change">wildfire season</a> led to a “super outbreak” of 32 separate pyrocumulonimbus, or pyroCB, events from December 29 to December 31  (<em>SN: 3/4/20</em>) . The resulting plume of smoke sent aloft was so massive that it rose <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/smoke-australian-fires-rose-higher-ozone-layer-than-ever-before">up to 35 kilometers into the atmosphere</a>, high into the stratosphere, well above the heights that jet planes fly (<em>SN: 6/15/20</em>). Combined with a second large plume on January 4, they injected three times more aerosol particles into the stratosphere than any previously recorded pyroCb event.</p>



<p>Such a long-lasting, intense event “was like nothing we’ve seen before,” eclipsing the previous record-holder, a vast fire cloud that formed over the Pacific Northwest in 2017, said David Peterson, a meteorologist at the U.S. Naval Research Laboratory in Monterey, Calif. The Australian outbreak “exceeded this previously unprecedented event on almost every level.” In terms of sheer number of aerosols sent into the stratosphere, the Australian plumes were <a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s43247-020-00022-5">on par with the strongest volcanic eruptions</a> in the last 25 years. </p>





<p>What impact these particles have on atmosphere, weather patterns and the ozone layer is still unclear. Scientists detected traces of the 2017 plume for up to 10 months; particles from the Black Summer plumes are still lingering, Peterson said. His work will appear in an upcoming issue of <em>npj</em> <em>Climate and Atmospheric Science</em>.</p>



<p>Whether these events will become increasingly common as the climate warms also isn’t clear. PyroCb clouds require both very large and intensely hot fires and thunderstorm-enabling conditions, including moisture, several kilometers up in the atmosphere. Those conditions could become more common in some regions due to climate change.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/camel-eating-plastic-trash-waste-deadly-masses">Plastic waste forms huge, deadly masses in camel guts</a></h4>

<p>Marcus Eriksen was studying plastic pollution in the Arabian Gulf when he met camel expert Ulrich Wernery. “[Ulrich] said, ‘You want to see plastic? Come with me.’ So we went deep into the desert,” Eriksen recalls. Before long, they spotted a camel skeleton and began to dig through sand and bones.</p>



<p>“We unearthed this mass of plastic, and I was just appalled. I couldn’t believe that — almost did not believe that — a mass as big as a medium-sized suitcase, all plastic bags, could be inside the rib cage of this [camel] carcass,” says Eriksen, an environmental scientist at the 5 Gyres Institute, a plastic pollution research and education organization in Santa Monica, Calif.</p>



<p>“We hear about marine mammals, sea lions, whales, turtles and seabirds impacted” by <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/mirco-plastic-debris-accumulating-far-beneath-ocean-surface">plastic waste</a>, Eriksen says (<em>SN: 6/6/19</em>). But “this is not just an ocean issue. It’s a land issue, too. It’s everywhere.”</p>



<p>About 390,000 dromedary camels (<em>Camelus dromedarius</em>) live in the United Arab Emirates. Now in a study in the February 2021 <em>Journal of Arid Environments</em>, Eriksen, Wernery and colleagues estimate that plastic kills around <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0140196320302731">1 percent of these culturally important animals</a>.</p>



<p>Of 30,000 dead camels that Wernery, a veterinary microbiologist at the Central Veterinary Research Laboratory in Dubai, and his team have examined since 2008, 300 had guts packed with plastic ranging from three to 64 kilograms. The researchers dubbed these plastic masses “polybezoars” to distinguish them from naturally occurring hair and plant fiber bezoars.</p>

Eriksen <em>et al/J. Arid Enviro.</em> 2021</span></figure></div>



<p>As dromedaries roam the desert looking for food, they munch on plastic bags and other trash that drift into trees and pile up along roadsides. “From the camel’s perspective … if it’s not sand, it’s food,” Eriksen says.</p>



<p>With a stomach full of plastic, camels don’t eat because they don’t feel hungry, and they starve to death. Plastic can also leach toxins and introduce bacteria that poison the one-humped mammals, Wernery says.</p>





<p>“If 1 percent mortality due to plastic is verified by future and more detailed studies, then plastic pollution will certainly represent a reason of concern for [camels],” says Luca Nizzetto, an environmental scientist at the Norwegian Institute for Water Research in Oslo, who was not involved with the research. “These types of studies are relevant to raise social awareness about this pollution.”</p>



<p>Banning plastic bags and single-use plastics is crucial for protecting camels and other wildlife, Eriksen says. “Plastic bags are escape artists. They blow out of garbage cans, out of landfills, out of trucks and out of people’s hands. They travel for hundreds of miles.”</p>

Unofficially, keep that place setting at the holiday table. Well, don’t, if you’re under travel restrictions for COVID-19. You get the picture.

                <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/dinosaur-fuzz-rods-feathers-first-southern-hemisphere">A newfound feathered dinosaur sported fuzz and weird rods on its shoulders</a></h4>

<p>The fossil of a chicken-sized, meat eater from Brazil that had a mane of fluffy filaments and a pair of stiff, ribbon-like streamers emerging from both shoulders is the first dinosaur with feathers ever discovered in the Southern Hemisphere.</p>



<p>Named <em>Ubirajara jubatus</em>, the plucky predator lived 110 million years ago and probably <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cretres.2020.104686">used its unusual shoulder feathers and mane for display purposes</a> to attract mates and ward off rivals, an international team of researchers reports online December 13 in <em>Cretaceous Research</em>.</p>



<p>The name <em>Ubirajara</em> means “lord of the spear”’ and comes from the local Tupi Indigenous language, while <em>jubatus</em> comes from the Latin for maned or crested.   </p>



<p>Many dinosaurs from the supercontinent of Gondwana, which covered much of the southern half of the planet during the Cretaceous Period, were assumed to have had feathers, but it’s exciting to finally have direct evidence, says study coauthor David Martill, a paleontologist at the University of Portsmouth in England.</p>





<p>“These [shoulder] structures are really elaborate; they made this animal look pretty spectacular, just as a bird of paradise looks spectacular [today],” he says. “When birds have these sorts of feathers, they do all sorts of posh dances and displays, so this dinosaur looks like it was a little show-off.”</p>



<p>The dinosaur is also interesting, because it is a member of the compsognathid group, which branched off from the family tree of carnivorous dinosaurs fairly early in the history of the group, Martill says. That suggests that the use of feathers for complex display purposes may have a very ancient history within the carnivorous dinosaurs.</p>



<p>Max Langer, a paleontologist at the University of São Paulo who was not involved in the research, says it was only a matter of time until a feathered dinosaur was discovered in the Crato Formation in northeastern Brazil, where the fossil came from, or the surrounding rocks of the Araripe Plateau. Here, “the fossilization is pristine” with many specimens recording even details such as muscle fibers and blood vessels, he says.  </p>



<p>A number of other dinosaurs without feathers have been found in the region. And a bird fossil with feathers, described in 2015, showed feather preservation in the rocks here was possible. </p>



<p>Langer adds that it’s a shame that an important fossil like this has ended up in Germany, rather than remaining in Brazil, and that Brazilian scientists were not involved in this research. “The fossils found here are part of the Brazilian paleontological heritage, so it is not good that this material is out of the country,” he argues.</p>



<p>The fossil was probably found by local quarrymen who extract paving slabs from the fossil-bearing limestones of the Crato Formation, says study coauthor Eberhard Frey, a geoscientist at the State Museum of Natural History Karlsruhe in Germany.</p>



<p>In the early 1990s, the fossil arrived at the paleontological museum in the city of Crato in Brazil’s Ceará state. Here, it came to the attention of Frey and Martill, who sought permission from local officials to export the fossil to Germany in 1995, where they have studied it in the intervening years, and where it remains today.</p>

<p><em>By</em> <a href="https://emmayoung.net/">Emma Young</a></p>



<p>What do you do if your child comes home with a lower score on a test than you both expected? Do you praise their efforts and focus on what they got right? Or do you home in on the answers that they got wrong, hoping this will help them to do better in future?</p>



<p>Research shows that the first, “success-oriented” response is more common in the US than in China, where parents more often opt for “failure-oriented” responses instead. <a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2019-59134-001">Recent studies in both countries </a>have found that success-oriented responses tend to encourage psychological wellbeing but not necessarily academic success, whereas failure-oriented responses can foster academic performance, but with a cost to the child’s wellbeing.</p>



<p>Jun Wei at Tsinghua University, China, and colleagues wondered what might drive these observed relationships: do different response styles lead children to form different concepts about what their parents want for them — and is this what produces the opposing impacts on wellbeing? In a <a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2020-79116-001">new paper</a>, published in <em>Developmental Psychology</em>, the team report some intriguing answers to these questions.</p>



<span id="more-41039"></span>



<p>The researchers studied 447 American children from three schools in the US and 439 children from a school in southern China. The children were in the same grade of school and were, on average, 13 at the start of the study. They completed a batch of initial surveys, and then a further batch a year later.</p>



<p>In one of the initial surveys, the children were asked to imagine that they had done very well and then very poorly on a school test, and indicate the extent to which they thought their parents would emphasise the successful aspects of their performance, or the negatives (e.g.  “My parents would talk about why I didn’t get an even higher score” if they had done well, or “My parents would talk about how I had not worked hard” if they had done poorly).</p>



<p>Along with surveys of general wellbeing and symptoms of anxiety and depression, the children also answered questions about their perceptions of their parents’ goals for them. Responses to statements such as “How important is it to your parents for you to believe in your abilities?” were used to probe parental goals relating to self-worth, while statements such as “How important is to your parents for you to always try to overcome your weaknesses?” explored the extent to which the children thought that their parents held “self-improvement” goals for them.  </p>



<p>The team found that, in both countries, children who felt that their parents were more success-oriented in their responses were more likely to feel that their parents held self-worth goals for them, and statistically speaking, this went a long way to explaining higher levels of general wellbeing in this group a year later. In the US only, stronger perceptions that parents held self-worth goals were also associated with fewer symptoms of anxiety and depression a year on. Why wasn’t this seen in the children in China, too? It might be because children in China are subject to more academic stress, because of the format of the school examination system, the team suggests — and the impact of this on symptoms of anxiety and depression overwhelms any variations relating to parental response style.</p>



<p>In both the US and China, the team also found that the more parents used failure-oriented responses, the more the children felt that their parents held self-improvement goals for them — and in China only, the more they felt their parents were concerned about their self-worth too. This may be “because Chinese parents convey their belief in their children’s potential by urging them to strive to do better”, the researchers write.</p>



<p>However, failure-oriented responses from the parents were also associated with decreased wellbeing among the American children, and higher levels of anxiety and depression symptoms in kids from both countries.  “It could be that when parents highlight the negative aspects of their children’s performance, adolescents feel incompetent, regardless of whether they perceive their parents as wanting them to constantly strive to self-improve,” the researchers write. “The thwarted need for competence may dampen adolescents’ psychological functioning.”</p>



<p>The team did home in only a few dimensions of the parent-child relationship, which is, of course, complex. For parents everywhere, it would certainly be interesting to know whether the positive academic effects of a failure-oriented response style could be gained without a cost to wellbeing — could an emphasis on praising successes with a dash of observation of any failures of effort work best, perhaps? I know that as parent, that’s what I aim for. But only future research will reveal if it’s actually a good strategy for my children.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/black-hole-center-milky-way-nearby-red-giant-stars-blue">The Milky Way’s central black hole may have turned nearby red giant stars blue</a></h4>

<p>Innumerable stars reside within 1.6 light-years of the Milky Way’s central black hole. But this same crowded neighborhood has fewer red giants — luminous stars that are large and cool — than expected.</p>



<p>Now astrophysicists have a new theory why: The supermassive black hole, Sagittarius A*, launched a powerful jet of gas that ripped off the red giants’ outer layers. That <a href="https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/abbd94">transformed the stars into smaller red giants or stars that are hotter and bluer</a>, Michal Zajaček, an astrophysicist at the Polish Academy of Sciences in Warsaw, and colleagues suggest in a paper published online November 12 in the <em>Astrophysical Journal</em>.</p>



<p>Today Sagittarius A* is quiet, but two enormous bubbles of gamma-ray-emitting gas rooted at the center of the Milky Way <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/x-ray-bubbles-center-milky-way-galaxy">tower far above and below the galaxy’s plane</a> (<em>SN: 12/9/20</em>). These gas bubbles imply the black hole sprang to life some 4 million years ago when something fell into it.</p>



<p>At that time, a disk of gas around the black hole shot a powerful jet of material into its star-studded neighborhood, <a>Zajaček</a> and colleagues propose. “The jet preferentially acts on large red giants,” he says. “They can be effectively ablated by the jet.” The biggest and brightest red giants seem to be missing near the galactic center, Zajaček says.</p>





<p>Red giants are vulnerable because they are large and their envelopes of gas tenuous. A red giant forms from a smaller star after the star’s center gets so full of helium that it can no longer burn its hydrogen fuel there. Instead, the star starts to burn hydrogen in a layer around the center, which makes the star’s outer layers expand, causing its surface to cool and turn red. As a result, some red giants are more than a hundred times the diameter of the sun, making them easy pickings for the jet.</p>



<p>Still, Zajaček says that as red giants orbit the black hole, they must pass through the jet hundreds or thousands of times before becoming hot, blue stars. The jet is most effective at removing red giants within 0.13 light-years of the black hole, the team calculates.</p>



<p>“The idea is plausible,” says Farhad Yusef-Zadeh, an astronomer at Northwestern University in Evanston, Ill., who was not involved with the study.</p>



<p>Tuan Do, an astronomer at UCLA, adds “it may take a combination of several of these kinds of mechanisms to fully explain the lack of the red giants.” In particular, he says, something other than a jet likely accounts for the paucity of red giants farther away from the black hole.</p>



<p>One candidate, say Zajaček and Do, is a large disk of gas that circled the black hole a few million years ago. This disk spawned stars that now orbit the black hole in a single plane. These young stars exist as far as 1.6 light-years from the black hole, which is also the extent of the red giant gap. As red giants revolved around the black hole and repeatedly plunged through the disk, its gas may have torn off their outer layers, explaining another part of the galactic center’s red star shortage.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/fda-authorize-pfizer-vaccine-covid-19-coronavirus-pandemic">The FDA has authorized Pfizer’s COVID-19 vaccine. Now what?</a></h4>

<p>Millions of Americans will soon be lining up for COVID-19 shots. </p>



<p>On December 11, <a href="https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/fda-takes-key-action-fight-against-covid-19-issuing-emergency-use-authorization-first-covid-19">the Food and Drug Administration granted emergency use authorization</a> for the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine for those age 16 and older. The decision comes as numbers of COVID-19 cases, hospitalizations and deaths have been rising at alarming rates. The United States recorded a record-high 3,411 COVID-19 deaths on December 9.</p>



<p>The United States is the latest country to authorize the vaccine, after the <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coronavirus-covid-19-vaccine-pfizer-uk-first-approval">United Kingdom</a>, Canada, Bahrain and Saudi Arabia (<em>SN: 12/2/20</em>). </p>



<p>Here’s what happens next in the United States.</p>





<h4>The vaccine starts to be shipped, but won’t have a widespread impact for several months.</h4>



<p>The Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine will likely be an enormous help in immediately keeping some people out of hospitals and preventing deaths. </p>



<p>But while the vaccine and any others that are authorized may protect individual people, when it comes to widespread public health changes, “it will likely be several months before we get the full positive impact of a vaccine,” infectious diseases expert Anthony Fauci said December 11 in an online interview with <em>JAMA.</em></p>



<p>Initial doses of vaccines will be limited. The federal government had previously said that 6.4 million Pfizer doses would be shipped out to states within 24 hours of FDA’s authorization. On December 9, a top official with the Trump Administration’s Operation Warp Speed said that only about half of those doses, about 2.9 million, will be shipped within 24 hours of emergency use authorization. Another 2.9 million will be held for distribution until the first vaccinated people are due for their second shot 21 days later. Another half a million doses have been set aside in a reserve, U.S. Army Gen. Gustave Perna, who is Warp Speed’s chief operating officer, said in a news conference. Vaccinations could begin as soon as early next week.   </p>

<p>A similar vaccine made by biotechnology company Moderna will undergo review by an advisory committee to FDA on December 17. An initial 12.5 million doses of that vaccine are expected to ship if it is authorized. </p>



<p>Overall, “we believe that there will be enough vaccine available for 20 million first vaccinations in the month of December,” said Alex Azar, the secretary of Health and Human Services, said in the Dec. 9 news conference.</p>



<p>A Centers for Disease Control and Prevention advisory panel has recommended that <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coronavirus-covid-19-who-should-get-vaccines-first">health care workers and people living in nursing homes should be the first</a> to get the vaccines, if both are authorized (<em>SN: 12/1/20</em>). But it will be up to states to work out the details of exactly who gets it and when.</p>



<h4>Scientists will look for hidden side effects and other health issues.</h4>



<p>As those doses are injected into arms, scientists will be on the lookout for answers to key questions. One big one: Are there hidden side effects?</p>



<p>In the United Kingdom, two people have had serious allergic reactions after getting Pfizer’s vaccine since its rollout December 8, prompting health officials there to recommend that people with “significant allergies” that trigger anaphylaxis not take the vaccine.</p>



<p>Those allergic reactions raise questions about whether the vaccine might cause very rare side effects not seen in the clinical trials. The trials, which included more than 40,000 people, found that the vaccine is safe, with side effects that include fever, chills, headache, pain at the injection site and fatigue. Those side effects tended to last for only a day or two and were generally mild to moderate.</p>



<p>Although such side effects could be unpleasant for some people, they are common reactions to vaccines approved for other diseases, experts say. But some side effects may come to light only once millions instead of thousands of people have been vaccinated.</p>



<p>And as millions of people get vaccinated, many other health issues, including deaths, may arise that may not be related to the vaccine but could be difficult to separate out, says Marm Kilpatrick, an infectious diseases researcher at the University of California, Santa Cruz. </p>



<p>Six people died during the clinical trials, though only two were in the vaccine group. Their deaths  — of a heart attack and of preexisting narrowing of blood vessels — were almost certainly not related to the vaccine, Kilpatrick says, but as many people get vaccinated, more deaths will happen just by chance, particularly among people with health problems. “Distinguishing the cause of all their deaths from any vaccinated related effects will not be trivial,” he says.</p>



<h4>People who already had COVID-19 may need to be vaccinated, too.</h4>



<p>A small number of people in the Pfizer trial had antibodies in their blood indicating that they had been infected prior to joining the study. Some of those people went on to develop COVID-19 during the study. That may suggest that having the disease doesn’t completely protect people from reinfection and that people who previously had COVID-19 should also get vaccinated. </p>



<p>But Kilpatrick, of University of California, Santa Cruz, isn’t convinced. “I wouldn’t say these data are slam dunk evidence that prior infection provides no protection,” he says. It’s important to know when those people had COVID-19, he says. Some people can continue to produce viral RNA for long periods of time, so some of the RNA detected might not be from a true reinfection, but left over from the first bout of disease. </p>



<p>To determine whether there is reinfection, doctors would need to determine the genetic makeup of the virus causing the first round of illness and compare it with the virus causing later rounds, such has been done for a few <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coronavirus-covid-19-first-case-reinfection-man-hong-kong">confirmed cases of reinfections</a> (<em>SN: 8/24/20</em>).</p>



<p>Also unknown is whether previously infected people could get away with a single vaccine shot to boost their natural immunity, or if they will need two shots like everyone else, says Mark Slifka, a microbiologist and immunologist at Oregon Health &amp; Science University in Portland. </p>



<h4>Scientists will wrestle with whether to vaccinate people in the placebo group.</h4>



<p>Another giant question is how long vaccine-induced protection against the coronavirus lasts. Researchers could learn that over time by continuing to track cases arising in the placebo group and the vaccine group in Pfizer’s late-stage clinical trial. But that raises a big question, too: Should people in the placebo group be given access to the vaccine? Pfizer has proposed to vaccinate the placebo group, but some scientists argue doing so would make it impossible to learn about the duration of protection and any long-term side effects.</p>



<p>People in the trial could ask to know whether they got the vaccine or not and ask for the vaccine if they were in the placebo group, but Slifka hopes the trial participants will continue to maintain their ignorance of which group they are in. Knowing could change the participant’s behavior and taint any data coming out of the trial, he says. </p>



<p>Many participants’ altruism will probably lead them to continue the trial as is. “The people who are on these studies are heroes,” Slifka says. “They’ve stepped up and stuck out their arms to get an experimental vaccine, not for just for themselves, but for the country and the world.”</p>



<p>But it becomes a trickier question about what to do about future vaccine trials. When vaccines are approved, it becomes unethical to do placebo-controlled trials. Instead, companies must show that their vaccines trigger immune reactions at least as strong as an existing vaccine. </p>



<aside class="wp-block-sciencenews-inline-related-post alignleft">
<h4>
<a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/editors-picks/2019-novel-coronavirus-outbreak">See all our coverage of the coronavirus outbreak</a>
</h4>
</aside>



<p>Usually that is done by measuring levels of antibodies produced after vaccination. If a new vaccine meets a certain standard level known to be protective — called a correlate of immunity — then it might also be approved, provided it is safe. But no one knows what level of antibodies or other defenses are needed to protect against COVID-19. </p>



<p>Also, the Pfizer vaccine is not yet fully approved and is in limited quantities, so other companies may still need to compare their vaccines to placebos to determine whether they work. It could be difficult to recruit people to take part in such trials once more vaccines are authorized. </p>



<h4>Research will continue on whether the vaccine works for children and other groups.</h4>



<p>While clinical trials have found the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine to be 95 percent effective overall, there’s not enough data to show that’s true for all populations.</p>



<p>Take children: Pfizer has been testing its vaccine in adolescents 12 and older and Moderna <a href="https://investors.modernatx.com/news-releases/news-release-details/moderna-announces-first-participants-dosed-phase-23-study-covid">began testing its vaccine in adolescents</a> December 10. There’s not yet enough data to say how well the vaccine works for them.</p>



<p>No companies have tested COVID-19 vaccines in kids younger than 12. Kids tend to develop milder symptoms of COVID-19 than adults do. As a result, trials testing effectiveness would have to be enormous if done the same way for children as in adults. Instead, vaccine makers might measure antibodies in younger vaccinated children to see whether kids have the same kinds of immune reactions to the vaccine as adults and teens. </p>



<p>There is also limited data on how well the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine works in people with HIV or hepatitis B or hepatitis C or in other immune-compromised people. </p>



<p>“If you have a person who is on chemotherapy for a cancer or for an autoimmune disease, the likelihood … is that their level of response to any vaccine will not be as robust as someone who doesn’t have an underlying condition,” Fauci said December 11. “That doesn’t mean you don’t want to vaccinate them. That means you have to vaccinate them. But you’ve got to be prepared that you’re not going to have, necessarily, a 95 percent protection.”</p>



<p>There was a fear that any COVID-19 vaccines wouldn’t work well for older or obese people, because age and obesity can both diminish immune responses, and people in both groups are at <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coronavirus-covid19-obesity-risk-factor">increased risk of developing severe COVID-19 or dying</a> (<em>SN: 4/22/20</em>). But data from the Pfizer trials suggest that the vaccine works just as well in people 65 and older as it does in younger adults. Obese people were also protected at levels similar to non-obese people.  Scientists will want to confirm that these groups are actually protected by the vaccine.</p>



<h4>Pfizer-BioNTech will continue to seek full FDA approval of its vaccine.</h4>



<p>The company probably will need to collect additional safety, as well as effectiveness, data to win full approval from the FDA and other regulatory agencies around the world. Emergency use authorization is provisional and lasts only as long as the emergency continues, Peggy Hamburg, a former FDA commissioner explained during a<a href="https://www.sciline.org/covid-vaccines-regulation-allocation-panelist-biographies"> news conference</a> December 3 hosted by SciLine, an independent, free service for journalists based at the American Association for the Advancement of Science. </p>



<p>Full approval would mean the vaccine meets all safety and effectiveness standards and is no longer experimental. The vaccine would become the standard by which any new COVID-19 vaccine is judged. </p>



<p>Vaccine developers are also not allowed to market their product under emergency use provisions as they can when the product gains full FDA approval.</p>



<h4>Life, slowly, returns to some semblance of normal?</h4>



<p>Even with multiple vaccines, life may not return to pre-pandemic normal anytime soon. “My optimistic hope is that we’ll be getting back to more normal life by fall” next year, says Ross McKinney Jr., a pediatric infectious diseases specialist and chief science officer of the Association of American Medical Colleges, based in Washington, D.C. </p>



<p>Controlling the pandemic with mask wearing, social distancing, avoiding gatherings especially indoors and taking other safety measures will be key to “coming out the other side,” says Jason Schwartz, a vaccination policy researcher at Yale School of Public Health. “Vaccines are amazing,” he says, but, “they can’t work miracles.”</p>

By making open access sustainable, it changed the world of academic publishing. Amongst the first disciplines to successfully embrace open access was genetics and genomics, with BMC launching a number of journals in this important field in its first year</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Today, BMC continues to recognize the importance of genetics and genomics with a number of our community-specific journals celebrating their 20th anniversaries, including </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">BMC Genetics</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">. As we reflect on our long-standing reputation as an open access pioneer, we remain passionate about promoting open science practices and responding to researcher’s needs in this vital field. One aspect that we view as central to this mission is the sharing of research data. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We know that research data often lie hidden until shared via a repository and/or through a research article that uses the data to support conclusions and analyses. We understand that not all valuable research is suited to traditional research articles and are committed to making visible research that would otherwise be hidden away. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As part of this commitment, we are delighted to announce that </span><a href="https://bmcgenet.biomedcentral.com/?utm_source=bmc_blogs&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=null&amp;utm_campaign=blog_2020_bmcseriesblog"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">BMC Genetics</span></i></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> will be renamed in 2021 as </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">BMC Genomic Data, </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">with the goal of promoting open science through the sharing of genomic and genetic data. </span></p>

                <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/new-image-reveals-sunspot-unrivaled-detail">This new image reveals a sunspot in unrivaled detail</a></h4>

<p>The largest solar telescope on Earth has gotten the sharpest glimpse ever of a sunspot.</p>



<p>Vaguely resembling a sunflower — or the Eye of Sauron from <em>The Lord of the Rings </em>— the spot appears as a dark blemish wreathed by ribbons of plasma that have been sculpted by magnetic fields sprouting from the spot’s center. At roughly 15,000 kilometers across, the entire spot could comfortably engulf Earth with room to spare.</p>



<p>The image was captured last January by <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs11207-020-01736-7">the new Daniel K. Inouye Solar Telescope</a> on Maui in Hawaii, observatory director Thomas Rimmele and colleagues report in the December 4 <em>Solar Physics</em>. With its 4-meter-wide mirror, the telescope is starting to provide <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/these-are-most-detailed-images-sun-ever-taken">the highest-resolution views of our star ever</a> (<em>SN: 1/29/20</em>). The ability to see details as small as 20 kilometers across may help researchers get at the root of <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/sun-first-map-solar-corona-magnetic-field">enduring mysteries about the sun</a> (<em>SN: 8/21/20</em>), such as why its outer atmosphere is millions of degrees hotter than its surface.</p>



<p>Sunspots mark where bundles of magnetic fields punch through the sun’s surface. The magnetic fields suppress hot gas bubbling up from below, which cools the surface and makes it appear darker than its surroundings. Whereas the average temperature at the surface is about 5,500° Celsius, the core of a sunspot might be “only” 3,700° C.</p>



<p>The image was taken as part of a test run for <a href="https://dkist.nso.edu/">the almost-finished telescope</a>, which should open for business sometime in 2021. While the observatory is aiming for late spring or early summer, says Claire Raftery, communications director at the National Solar Observatory in Boulder, Colo., the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic may delay the opening.</p>

<p><strong>Researchers have created a safer version of the psychoactive drug ibogaine, and it seems to improve behaviours associated with addiction and depression in rats.</strong> Past work had suggested that ibogaine may help treat drug addictions — but it can also have fatal side-effects, <a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2020/12/09/944572325/progress-toward-a-safer-psychedelic-drug-to-treat-depression-and-addiction">reports Jon Hamilton</a> at <em>NPR</em>. So in the new work, scientists tweaked the structure of the molecule to create a substance that is safer but which still has beneficial properties. It remains to be seen whether it works for humans.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/baikal-seals-feed-like-whales-crustaceans-comb-shaped-teeth">Using comb-shaped teeth, Baikal seals feed on tiny crustaceans like whales do</a></h4>

<p>Baikal seals are fans of bite-sized portions, and this dietary quirk may be why the seals are thriving.</p>



<p>Found in Russia’s immense Lake Baikal, the Siberian mammals devour tiny marine crustaceans, likely using comblike teeth in a manner similar to how baleen whales feed, a new study finds.</p>



<p>The research suggests that Baikal seals (<em>Pusa sibirica</em>) use a combination of special teeth, speed and skill <a href="https://www.pnas.org/content/early/2020/11/10/2014021117">to gobble up dozens of inch-long critters called amphipods</a> on a single dive, scientists report November 16 in the <em>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences</em>. </p>



<p>Typically, seals eat fish and mollusks, though some southern seals, like crabeater seals (<em>Lobodon carcinophaga</em>), are honed eaters of krill, another type of small crustacean. For the Baikal seals, there may be big benefits to hunting amphipods. The crustaceans “are very predictable,” says marine biologist Yuuki Watanabe at the National Institute of Polar Research in Tokyo. “They form big aggregations, and they come to the surface in the nighttime.”</p>





<p>Exploiting such a dependable food source low in the food chain, Watanabe says, may make Baikal seals more resilient than other seals to <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/lakes-worldwide-feel-heat-climate-change">human-driven environmental impacts</a> such as warming temperatures (<em>SN: 5/1/17</em>). </p>



<p>As many as 115,000 <em>P. sibirica</em> seals populate Lake Baikal, and the species is listed as “least concern” by the International Union for Conservation of Nature. This is far more abundant than seals in similar lake habitats — like the ringed seals of Lake Ladoga in northwestern Russia and Lake Saimaa in Finland, which together number a few thousand.</p>



<p>Watanabe has studied Baikal seals since 2003. Back then, he had evidence from depth-measuring devices mounted on the seals that showed that they reliably shifted their diving depths through the night, suggesting the animals might be following a particular food source. </p>



<p>And previous records of seals’ stomach contents had showed that the animals were at least occasionally eating amphipods, which make daily migrations from the depths to the shallows and back again. So in June 2018, Watanabe returned to Lake Baikal, the world’s largest and oldest freshwater lake, to see if he could gather direct evidence that the seals were feeding on swarms of amphipods. </p>



<p>Watanabe and colleagues caught eight seals and attached cameras and accelerometers to their backs, recording what the seals were eating, how fast they were swimming and their diving depths. The team found that the seals were rapidly snatching up individual amphipods on their night dives, as many as 154 in one descent and catching an amphipod every 2.5 seconds. </p>



<p>Over a single day, the seals are estimated to make thousands of catches. All those snacks add up. Based on Watanabe and colleagues’ estimations, Baikal seals may be getting about 20 percent of their daily calorie requirements just from amphipods.</p>



<p>When Watanabe examined Baikal seal skulls in museum collections and compared the skulls with those of other seals, he noticed the cheek teeth of the Baikal animals have folded margins that give the teeth a comblike shape with longer, more developed prongs than any other northern seal species. Baikal seals may be using these teeth to efficiently sieve their plankton prize from the lake, expelling excess water with every gulp, the researchers say. </p>



<p>Mia Wege, a marine ecologist at the University of Pretoria in South Africa, was surprised such small prey could form a major part of the diet of a seal.</p>



<p>The size of the freshwater amphipods that Baikal seals eat, she says, “is much smaller than other krill or amphipod species consumed by seals.” That makes sense though because the Siberian seals themselves are among the smallest seal species, with bodies that can run on less fuel, Wege says. </p>



<p>In the future, Watanabe wants to conduct feeding experiments to confirm how the seals are using their comblike chompers. He also wants to study the animals’ winter diet, since he thinks amphipods may be gathering underneath the lake’s winter ice, potentially providing a reliable, dense feast for hungry seals. Determining how seasonal ice cover influences the seals’ food sources is of increasing importance, says Watanabe, since the lake’s winter ice is waning due to climate change.</p>

A team of researchers in England has retracted a 2014 paper after a graduate student affiliated with the group found a fatal error while trying to replicate parts of the work — and which might affect similar studies by other scientists, as well. The article, “Perceptual load affects spatial tuning of neuronal populations in human … <a class="more-link" href="https://retractionwatch.com/2020/12/11/the-grad-student-who-found-a-fatal-error-that-may-affect-lots-of-papers/">Continue reading <span class="screen-reader-text">The grad student who found a fatal error that may affect lots of papers</span></a>

<p>The benefits of Pfizer-BioNTech’s COVID-19 vaccine outweigh its risks for emergency use in those 16 and older in the United States, a panel of vaccine experts told the Food and Drug Administration on December 10.</p>



<p>The recommendation followed a daylong meeting that the panel held to discuss data collected from clinical trials of the vaccine involving more than 40,000 people. The panel overwhelmingly voted to allow emergency use. Some members voted against, mostly on the grounds that there aren’t enough data on 16- and 17-year-olds to say whether the vaccine carries more benefit than risk for teens who are at relatively low risk of severe disease and death.</p>



<p>Though not binding, recommendations from the panel, the Vaccines and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee, are often taken by the FDA. The agency must now decide whether to authorize the vaccine for emergency use, a decision that could be made as soon as the next few days.</p>

<p>In clinical trials, the vaccine was about 95 percent effective at keeping vaccinated people from developing COVID-19 symptoms, Pfizer reported, confirming data the company had already released. </p>



<p>The company had also previously indicated that the vaccine could protect against severe illness. But there were not enough severe cases in the studies to make that determination, some experts not involved in the trials said at the meeting. Others argued that other vaccines that prevent milder illness also prevent severe illnesses and that the data suggest the Pfizer vaccine can also help stave off the worst complications.</p>



<p>It’s <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/covid-19-coronavirus-vaccines-questions-social-distance-mask-transmission">not yet known to what extent the vaccine can also prevent infection</a> or transmission (<em>SN: 12/8/20</em>). Pfizer said December 10 that it is measuring antibodies in participants’ blood to determine whether there have been asymptomatic infections among the vaccinated group, which could help answer those questions. </p>



<p>Data from the vaccine’s clinical trials indicate that the vaccine is safe. Several <a href="https://www.idsociety.org/Podcasts/videos/idsa-media-briefing-COVID-19-Vaccine-Progress-Report/">side effects</a> include fever, headache, arm soreness, pain at the injection site and a feeling of being rundown, all of which could be unpleasant, but are common reactions to vaccines approved for other diseases. </p>



<p>Given COVID-19’s potential deadliness, “the vaccine is a very good trade-off in terms of benefits and risks,” says Marm Kilpatrick, an infectious diseases researcher at the University of California, Santa Cruz, who wasn’t involved in the meeting. </p>



<p>“But the side effects [seen in the trials] are substantial enough that it will be very important to communicate clearly about them prior to giving the shot or else many folks won’t want a second dose, and some will be scared off by hearing peoples’ experiences,” Kilpatrick says.</p>



<p>In the United Kingdom, two people have had serious allergic reactions after getting the vaccine since its rollout there, which began December 8. That prompted health officials there to recommend that people with “significant allergies” that trigger anaphylaxis not take the vaccine. </p>



<p>FDA’s analysis showed that people in the Pfizer vaccinated group were slightly more likely to have allergic reactions than those in the placebo group, officials said at the meeting. In the trial, 137 people in the vaccine group reported an allergy-like reaction while 111 in the placebo group did. The agency has asked Pfizer for more data and additional monitoring of allergies. </p>

<p>Another possible concern is that four people in the vaccine group developed a neurological condition called Bell’s palsy, while there were no cases in the placebo group. The incidence of the disorder, which causes a temporary weakness or paralysis in muscles of the face, was not greater than in the general population. But the FDA said they would be carefully monitoring for that potential side effect if the vaccine gets the go-ahead.</p>



<p>Those unusual reactions raise questions about whether the vaccine might cause very rare side effects not seen in the clinical trials. Some side effects may come to light only once millions instead of thousands of people have been vaccinated. </p>



<p>The committee also debated whether to vaccinate people in the clinical trials who got a placebo. In its report released December 8, the FDA said that people who got the placebo <a href="https://www.fda.gov/media/144245/download">would not be eligible to now get the vaccine</a> while it is still under emergency use authorization. That’s because giving the vaccine would erase the comparison group and make it difficult to determine whether the vaccine is effective and safe in the long run. </p>



<p>But withholding the vaccine from people at risk of COVID-19 complications may be considered unethical or irresponsible. Pfizer has proposed keeping the trial going, but to offer the vaccine to placebo group participants over time when they would normally become eligible for it, based on availability, had they not joined the study.</p>



<p>A CDC advisory panel has recommended that <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coronavirus-covid-19-who-should-get-vaccines-first">health care workers and people living in nursing homes</a> should be the first to get the vaccine, if authorized (<em>SN: 12/1/20</em>). But it will be up to states to work out the details of exactly who gets it and when.</p>



<p>The committee also discussed potential pitfalls with the vaccine’s rollout. It’s known that the vaccine, which requires two doses, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coronavirus-covid-19-why-vaccines-cold-freeze-pfizer-moderna">has to be kept frozen at –70° Celsius to maintain its effectiveness</a> (<em>SN: 11/20/20</em>). That unique requirement could make for <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/covid19-coronavirus-vaccine-last-mile-logistics-pfizer-moderna">tricky logistics</a> when distributing the vaccine (<em>SN: 12/3/20</em>). </p>



<p>But the vaccine also has to be mixed differently from other vaccines, and must be administered within six hours of dilution, Anita Patel, senior adviser with the CDC’s Pandemic Medical Care and Countermeasures program said during the meeting. That could have a learning curve and might result in the loss of some doses if the vaccine isn’t handled properly. </p>



<p>Medical personnel also have to get special training about how to open and close the shipping containers to avoid prematurely thawing the vaccine. A minimum order of the vaccine, which includes 975 doses, may cause problems in rural areas that aren’t set up to distribute that much vaccine quickly, Patel said. </p>



<p>The committee’s guidance comes as numbers of COVID-19 cases, hospitalizations and deaths have been rising at alarming rates in the country. The United States recorded more than 3,000 COVID-19 deaths on December 9, a new daily record. </p>



<p>A similar vaccine made by biotechnology company Moderna will undergo review by the advisory committee on December 17. </p>

                <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/tasmanian-devils-highly-contagious-face-cancer-endemic">A highly contagious face cancer may not wipe out Tasmanian devils after all</a></h4>

<p>Tasmanian devils were supposed to be extinct by now. With a deadly, highly contagious face cancer tearing through devil populations, forecasts over the past decade or so spelled imminent doom for the iconic marsupial.</p>



<p>Only 25,000 or so devils (<em>Sarcophilus harrisii</em>) remain, down from about 150,000 in the 1990s, but a new analysis offers hope. Devil facial tumor disease has <a href="https://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/doi/10.1126/science.abb9772">become far less transmissible since the peak of the epidemic</a>, suggesting it won’t wipe out the species, researchers report in the Dec. 11 issue of <em>Science.</em></p>



<p>Instead, the disease may stick around at lower levels, or “the tumor itself might eventually go extinct,” says Andrew Storfer, an evolutionary geneticist at Washington State University in Pullman.</p>



<p>Storfer and his colleagues reconstructed the history of the tumor’s spread by analyzing changes in tumor genes that evolve in a regular, clocklike manner. Samples from 51 tumors dating back to 2003 helped calibrate this timeline.</p>





<p>Though the <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/tasmanian-devil-disease-reveals-its-secrets">disease was discovered in 1996</a> (<em>SN: 3/11/13</em>), the study found that it probably originated years earlier, in the ‘80s, slowly circulating at first. At its peak in the late ‘90s, each afflicted devil was infecting 3.5 other devils, on average, usually through biting. Recently, that number has fallen to one, suggesting the epidemic may peter out.</p>



<p>The slowdown may stem from population decline — fewer devils means fewer transmission opportunities for a disease that spreads fastest within dense groups. Additionally, the tumor itself might have become less transmissible; the researchers identified some genes that could underlie this shift. Finally, the <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/tasmanian-devils-evolve-resistance-contagious-cancer">devils themselves seem to have evolved resistance</a> to the disease (<em>SN: 8/30/16</em>).</p>



<p>But devils are still endangered, and some experts want to introduce captive-bred animals to boost numbers. That could backfire, Storfer says, by allowing the disease to take off again. “It sounds boring, but doing nothing might be the best option for the devils.”</p>

                <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/how-ticks-gene-protein-protection-bacteria-human-skin">How some ticks protect themselves from deadly bacteria on human skin</a></h4>

<p>Ticks may have reason to be as wary of us as we are of them.</p>



<p>Bacteria that are potentially deadly to the bloodsuckers live on human skin. But a gene from bacteria that ticks incorporated into their genetic code around 40 million years ago helps protect the arachnids from those would-be microbial killers, a new study finds.</p>



<p>That gene makes a protein, called Dae2, that black-legged ticks (<em>Ixodes scapularis­</em>) can use to <a href="https://www.cell.com/cell/fulltext/S0092-8674(20)31449-5">fend off microbial threats</a>, researchers report December 10 in <em>Cell</em>. But it’s not an equal opportunity weapon. In a test tube, the protein doesn’t mess with bacteria that don’t bother the ticks, including <em>Borrelia burgdorferi</em>, the bacterial cause of Lyme disease.</p>



<p>The finding may explain how ticks can get past humans’ defenses to transmit disease through their bite, including Lyme disease, the most <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/new-species-bacteria-found-cause-lyme-disease">common tick-borne disease</a> in North America (<em>SN: 6/23/16</em>).</p>





<p>The arachnids’ saliva harbors many bacteria-killing proteins. But few studies have analyzed how such proteins allow ticks to defend themselves from some microbes while retaining species that aren’t dangerous to the ticks, says Albert Mulenga, a vector biologist at Texas A&amp;M University in College Station who was not involved in the study. Such studies could help scientists pinpoint the proteins crucial for tick feeding as well as disease transmission. Researchers may then be able to develop ways to interfere with these proteins, stopping ticks from spreading disease.</p>



<p>Bacteria today use their version of Dae2 to attack and kill other bacteria competing for nutrients by targeting and degrading a component of the cell wall. Without that component, rival bacterial cells break down and die. But it was unclear how black-legged ticks use their version of Dae2, which is found in tick saliva and guts.</p>



<p>The biggest question was which bacteria does the ticks’ Dae2 target, says Seemay Chou, a microbiologist and biochemist at the University of California, San Francisco.</p>



<p>Chou and colleagues predicted that Dae2 might help black-legged ticks control the growth of <em>B. burgdorferi</em>. Previous work had shown that ticks without Dae2 <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25470067/">carried more of the Lyme disease microbe</a> than ticks with Dae2 when the arachnids fed on mice infected with the microbe. But repeated experiments found that the protein failed to kill the bacteria in a test tube, suggesting that the team’s hypothesis was wrong.</p>



<p>“We wanted that to be true so bad that we were missing the red lights telling us that can’t be the case,” says Beth Hayes, a microbiologist in Chou’s lab.</p>



<p>When Chou, Hayes and colleagues finally began testing the protein against other types of bacteria, the ticks’ Dae2 turned out to be surprisingly effective. In a test tube, Dae2 killed <em>Bacillus subtilis</em>, a common bacterial species found in soil, as well as human skin-dwelling species like <em>Staphylococcus epidermidis</em> and <em>Corynebacterium propinquum</em>. Those bacteria don’t typically cause disease in people. But they could be bad news for ticks, the researchers concluded.</p>



<p>When ticks that were prevented from making Dae2 or had its activity blocked fed on mice, the arachnids tended to have higher levels of <em>Staphylococcus </em>bacteria than ticks with active Dae2. And when the researchers infected ticks lacking Dae2 with <em>S. epidermidis, </em>fewer than 40 percent survived longer than a day. Most infected ticks that had Dae2, however, survived as long as uninfected ticks.</p>



<p>Looking back, “it doesn’t really make sense to look at the things that are surviving and thriving in ticks,” Chou says. “The Lyme pathogen is clearly in a harmonious partnership with the tick, so if the tick immune system evolved to target anything, it’s all the things that aren’t there.”</p>



<p>It’s still unclear what might happen to ticks that encounter <em>Staphylococcus </em>bacteria in nature. “We really don’t know how much bacteria are in the bloodmeal while [ticks] are feeding,” Mulenga says. It’s possible that the arachnids may be exposed to levels that are nonlethal but might have other negative effects, such as preventing ticks from progressing through their life cycle.      </p>



<p>Still, the findings emphasize that ticks are “really elegant bloodsucking machines,” and highlight that the word “pathogen” is just a status, dependent on who the host is, Chou says. As ticks feed on blood, there is a “mirror situation where the ticks [carry] the Lyme pathogen, which is super bad for us, and our skin microbes are super bad for the ticks,” she says.</p>

<p><em>By </em><a href="http://emilyoliviareynolds.com/">Emily Reynolds</a></p>



<p>Anyone who’s been invested in an election result will understand the close relationship between politics and emotion — something that is perhaps even more affecting when that result is disappointing. After the 2016 presidential election, for example, articles appeared in the US press describing a “<a href="https://slate.com/human-interest/2016/09/trump-induced-anxiety-is-a-real-thing.html">national nervous breakdown</a>” and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/17/opinion/depressed-by-politics-just-let-go.html">offering tips</a> to deal with so-called “political depression”, and empirical <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0165178117320322?via%3Dihub">studies</a> indicated that the same event had caused psychological distress.</p>



<p>But while it would be hard to deny that politics can have a serious impact on our mood, is it correct to call that “depression”? Almog Simchon at Ben-Gurion University of the Negev and team ask this question in a <a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2020-27301-001">new paper</a> published in the <em>Journal of Experimental Psychology </em>— and while they find <em>self-reported</em> “Trump depression” in liberal Americans post-election, the empirical data suggests this isn’t an enduring or even clinically significant experience.</p>



<span id="more-41011"></span>



<p>In the first part of the study, participants indicated which political party they felt the greatest identification with, as well as which presidential candidate they had voted for in 2016; they then indicated how down, depressed and hopeless they had felt for the year before the election, the two weeks before the election, and from the election until the day of the survey, which took place in May 2018. As expected, those who identified as Democrats reported feeling more depressed after the election, with the opposite effect to be found in Republicans.</p>



<p>The team then repeated the experiment with new participants — only now all references to the election were omitted, with questions instead focusing purely on the timeframes involved. This time, there was no evidence of a post-election increase in depression among Democrats. This suggests that the emotional valence of certain events can change the stories we tell about ourselves and our lives.</p>



<p>The next study looked more broadly at liberal American responses to the election using real time data about people’s moods at the time of the election. To do this, the team used a machine learning algorithm originally designed to detect depression from social media users’ posts. The team analysed over 10 million tweets posted between October and November 2016, and while there <em>was</em> an effect on Democrats’ moods in the first few days after the election, this response was not long-lived: by November 13th, moods had returned to their pre-election baseline. A similar analysis of Google searches, looking for terms such as “depression”, “depression symptoms”, and “depression test” also found no indication that the election had caused a significant increase in depression.</p>



<p>Social media <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2018/04/23/are-tweets-a-goldmine-for-psychologists-or-just-a-lot-of-noise-researchers-clash-over-the-meaning-of-social-media-data/">may not be the best gauge</a> for understanding the long-term impact of an event on mental health — Twitter in particular is fast-moving and responsive to ongoing events, and not necessarily so good at capturing deeper or more persistent effects. But the findings do suggest, again, that emotional responses to the election were more ephemeral than the term “depression” might suggest.</p>



<p>Two final studies looked at real world attempts to seek help for depression. The first looked at state-level antidepressant consumption on Medicaid between 2016 and 2017, and the second at the number of people seeking treatment for depression before and after the election, using a data set that also contained daily information about depression and political affiliation.</p>



<p>For the state-level data, the team found that the state’s political affiliation — Democratic or Republican — had no bearing on changes in antidepressant usage from before to after the election. And in the second study, there was no evidence that the depression levels of liberal Americans increased after the election.</p>



<p>So it seems that reports of “Trump depression” are not quite accurate: in every study other than the first — in which participants were specifically reminded of the election — there was no evidence at all that depression had increased after the election.</p>



<p>The team suggests that self-reports of post-election depression could be somewhat performative, signalling group identity and ideological beliefs. This might not tell the whole story, though — there’s no evidence here that the feelings of distress or hopelessness felt by liberals after the election were false or purely performative, just that they weren’t clinically significant or persistent enough to be considered depression per se.</p>



<p>It would be interesting to look further into the traits and demographics of those reporting feelings of distress. If you’re a wealthy person with liberal politics, for example, then an election win for a pro-austerity party might be distressing but is unlikely to have as significant an impact on the material conditions of your life as that of someone on a low wage or in precarious work. Would the latter party be more likely to experience depression? And what protective factors are at play when it comes to weathering political distress?</p>



<p>The team partly puts the use of the term “Trump depression” down to “concept creep”, an expanding or overgeneralisation of the terminology of mental illness or trauma. It therefore seems important to develop a way to talk about distress — political or otherwise — outside of such terms, which can often be stigmatising or lacking in nuance. Using clinical terms unnecessarily might seem validating, but only serves to diminish both the experiences of those living with serious mental illness and the range of normal emotions that we experience across our political, social and personal lives. </p>

                <h4><a href="https://blog.arxiv.org/2020/12/10/instant-access-to-code-for-any-arxiv-paper/">Instant access to code, for any arXiv paper</a></h4>

<p> </p>
<p>In October, <a href="https://arxiv.org/">arXiv</a> released <a href="https://blog.arxiv.org/2020/10/08/new-arxivlabs-feature-provides-instant-access-to-code/">a new feature empowering arXiv authors to link their Machine Learning articles to associated code</a>. Developed in an <a href="https://blog.arxiv.org/2020/09/28/arxivlabs-a-space-for-community-innovation/">arXivLabs</a> collaboration with <a href="https://paperswithcode.com/about">Papers with Code</a>, the tool was met with great enthusiasm from arXiv’s ML community.</p>
<p>Now, we’re expanding the capability beyond Machine Learning to arXiv papers in every category. And, to better align with our arXiv communities, <a href="https://medium.com/paperswithcode/papers-with-code-is-expanding-to-more-sciences-5d375d10ca3a">PwC is launching new sites</a> in computer science, physics, mathematics, astronomy and statistics to help researchers explore code in these fields.</p>
<p><a href="https://arxiv.org/"><img alt="Screenshot of abstract page with code tab highlighted" class="wp-image-710 size-full aligncenter" height="782" src="https://blog.arxiv.org/files/2020/10/Screen-Shot-2020-10-07-at-1.34.57-PM.png" width="924" /></a></p>
<p>As part of this expansion, PwC is indexing 600,000 additional papers, automatically detecting and linking to the code libraries for papers in categories beyond Machine Learning and also continuing to identify code, results, and methods within ML.</p>
<p><a href="https://portal.paperswithcode.com/"><img alt="Image of Papers with Code portal sites" class="wp-image-830 size-medium alignleft" height="300" src="https://blog.arxiv.org/files/2020/12/PwC-Portals-222x300.png" width="222" /></a>Authors can sync their code to display on arXiv abstract pages from either their <a href="https://arxiv.org/user/">arXiv user account page</a> or the <a href="https://portal.paperswithcode.com">Papers with Code</a> interface, if the code is not automatically detected.</p>
<p>This expansion was driven by the broader research community’s demand. After the October release, researchers beyond ML expressed a desire for easy access to relevant code. Researchers in physics, astronomy, and other fields began adding their work to PwC. To answer the popular demand, we worked together with PwC to formally support additional fields.</p>
<p>arXiv authors and readers value speed and openness, and instant access to publicly available code supports both.</p>

<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="alignleft size-large"><img alt="a photo of Yvette Calderon" class="wp-image-3094333" height="450" src="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/121920_ye_covid-voices_calderon_680-450x450.jpg" width="450" /><span class="caption wp-caption-3094333">Yvette Calderon</span><span class="credit wp-credit-3094333">Mount Sinai Health System</span></figure></div>



<p><strong>Yvette Calderon</strong> is chair of emergency medicine at Mount Sinai Beth Israel Hospital. She was on the front lines of New York’s City’s early pandemic surge.</p>



<p><strong>Q:</strong> How did the pandemic change your work?</p>





<p><strong>Calderon:</strong> It was a very stressful time. it was really important to check in with everyone — nursing staff, faculty, residents, the [physician’s assistants] — just to make sure we had a mental health check. We saw a lot of death, more than I’ve ever seen in a short period of time.</p>



<p><strong>Q:</strong> Tell us about your experience.</p>



<p><strong><strong>Calderon</strong>:</strong> It was very isolating. You saw the fear on everyone’s face, not only the patients, but your peers, your staff. It was just incredibly tense. Yet there was nowhere else that I wanted to be.</p>



<p><strong>Q:</strong> What surprised you about the public’s response to the pandemic?</p>



<p><strong><strong>Calderon</strong>: </strong>Nothing. New Yorkers are awesome. How New Yorkers came together in this crisis, from the 7 o’clock clapping to people going out of their way with food for health providers, making sure that the elderly had [what they needed], kids creating incredible masks and shields for our essential workers.</p>



<p><strong>Q: </strong>What has made your job hard?</p>



<p><strong><strong>Calderon</strong>:</strong> Not knowing. I haven’t seen my mom in several months and I lost my father [to COVID] on April 6. Both of them had COVID. I made an appointment to see [Mom] this week. But [the nursing facility] can call me and say there’s another outbreak and then I can’t see her.</p>



<p>To be a physician that has spent your whole life taking care of patients, holding patients’ hands when they’re at the end of their life, crying with the patient’s family, and to not be able to be with my father was the biggest heartbreak of all.</p>



<p><strong>Q:</strong> What gives you hope for the future?</p>



<p><strong><strong>Calderon</strong>:</strong> Several colleges and medical schools have reached out to me to do presentations on health disparities. What gives me hope is how many incredibly bright, passionate young individuals want to understand [why certain groups are getting more seriously ill]. And actually want to do something about it.</p>

<p><strong>Abigail Echo-Hawk</strong>, a citizen of the Pawnee Nation of Oklahoma, is chief research officer at the Seattle Indian Health Board, a federally qualified health center that serves American Indians and Alaska Natives in the Puget Sound region. As director of the Urban Indian Health Institute, she focuses on gathering data on the more than 70 percent of American Indians and Alaska Natives who live off tribal reservation lands, and whose information is rarely collected or analyzed, making COVID-19 resource allocation difficult.</p>



<p><strong>Q: </strong>How has the pandemic changed your work?</p>



<p><strong><strong><strong>Echo-Hawk</strong></strong>:</strong> I had to take my staff and redirect them, which means that work we’re doing on cancer prevention and HIV prevention is going to suffer. HIV is an epidemic within our community. But right now, COVID-19 is killing our people every single day.</p>



<p><strong>Q: </strong>What do you want people to know about your experience?</p>



<p><strong><strong>Echo-Hawk</strong>:</strong> We are really suffering from a lack of resources, and that suffering is not new. As a result of the continuous underfunding of public health infrastructure within the Native community, and all public health infrastructure, this country set up a perfect environment for a pandemic to run wild.</p>



<p><strong>Q:</strong> What has surprised you about the public’s response?</p>



<p><strong><strong>Echo-Hawk</strong>:</strong> Some tribal nations made incredible public health decisions before states did, before counties did, before cities did. They closed off their reservations, they shut down businesses, they worked to put together support systems to take care of their elders.</p>



<p><strong>Q: </strong>What one thing is making your job hard?</p>



<p><strong><strong>Echo-Hawk</strong>: </strong>Access to good-quality data. We know that people of color are more at risk for COVID and for mortality from COVID. It is going to be imperative to prioritize folks who are most at risk for getting [a] vaccine. How are we going to know that those priority populations are actually the ones getting that vaccine?</p>



<p><strong>Q:</strong> What gives you hope?</p>



<p><strong><strong>Echo-Hawk</strong>:</strong> Because of the pandemic, along with all the other things that have happened on addressing racial justice within the United States, there is a level of awareness in the U.S. about racial disparities, in health, in policing. It’s given me hope for the future, that we can build a new normal where all people have equal value and equal worth.</p>

<p><strong>Dale Chappell</strong> is chief scientific officer of Humanigen, a biotech company in Burlingame, Calif., that makes the monoclonal antibody lenzilumab, developed to prevent an immune system overreaction known as a cytokine storm. The drug is in Phase II and Phase III clinical trials against COVID-19. Chappell is currently based outside Geneva.</p>



<p><strong>Q:</strong> How has the pandemic changed your work?</p>



<p><strong><strong>Chappell</strong>:</strong> I’m a scientist by training, but I came to biotechnology initially as an investor. I joined the Humanigen board and then after discussion with the board and management team I became the full-time chief scientific officer. [With the pandemic,] I’ve dedicated full time to lenzilumab, making sure we can get this drug to patients as quickly as possible.</p>



<p><strong>Q: </strong>How did your training prepare you to fight the pandemic?</p>



<p><strong><strong>Chappell</strong>: </strong>After medical school I did a postdoc fellowship at the National Institutes of Health in Bethesda, Md., and I studied [granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor], an immune system chemical that initiates the cytokine storm that can [occur] in COVID-19. So for me, this has come full circle. This is exactly what I should be doing at this moment in time.</p>



<p><strong>Q:</strong> What have you learned?</p>



<p><strong><strong>Chappell</strong>:</strong> It’s been really interesting to watch the global pharma and biotech community all come together to try to address this pandemic. The information-sharing. The fact that people are willing to put their data out on preprint servers.</p>



<p><strong>Q: </strong>What has surprised you about the public’s response?</p>



<p><strong><strong>Chappell</strong>: </strong>I’m living in Switzerland. The initial [European] lockdowns and quarantines [were] a pretty amazing act of humanity by everyone to try to flatten the curve, to keep the hospitals from being overrun.</p>



<p><strong>Q: </strong>What is making your job hard to do?</p>



<p><strong><strong>Chappell</strong>:</strong> As a small company trying to take on a global pandemic, it’s always resources. We could use more people, we could use more clinical trial sites. We can’t get data fast enough. We need more hours in the day.</p>



<p><strong>Q: </strong>What gives you hope for the future?</p>



<p><strong><strong>Chappell</strong>:</strong> The way governments around the world, and the biopharma industry, the way they’ve all come together to tackle this pandemic. We’ve learned a dramatic amount. In six, 12, 18 months’ time, I think we’re going to know a lot more. And hopefully, life will start to look a little more normal.</p>



<p><strong>Q: </strong>What do you miss about your old life?</p>



<p><strong><strong>Chappell</strong>:</strong> The human interaction with colleagues. Going to scientific conferences, having that personal interaction. It’s tough to do by Zoom.</p>

<p><strong>Michael Bowen</strong> is executive vice president of Prestige Ameritech in North Richland Hills, Texas, a maker of surgical masks and respirators. He predicted that a future epidemic would eat up U.S. supplies of personal protective equipment because most PPE is made in other countries.</p>



<p><strong>Q:</strong> How has the pandemic changed your life?</p>



<p><strong><strong>Bowen</strong>:</strong> We work all the time, my business partner and I. I am the face of the company; I have the easy job. He is literally living at the office: He has an RV parked there and goes home only on weekends. Our sales have increased 600 percent. We’ve grown from 80 people to 260. We were selling 75,000 respirators per month. We’re now selling 5 million per month. By January or February we’ll be making 10 million a month.</p>



<p><strong>Q: </strong>What do you want people to know about your experience?</p>



<p><strong><strong>Bowen</strong>: </strong>I’ve gotten thousands of emails in a day: “My daughter is a nurse and she’s been wearing the same mask for 30 days. Can you help me?” It was heartbreaking. I want people to know that America needs to make its own products.</p>



<p><strong>Q:</strong> What have you learned during the pandemic?</p>



<p><strong><strong>Bowen</strong>:</strong> That humans aren’t very good at preparing for things. After this is over, people are going to forget. Hospitals are going to think: What are the odds of it happening again? I went through this before, in [the 2009] H1N1 [avian flu pandemic]. We had people calling, very emotional: I need help, we need masks. And then they didn’t stick with us.</p>



<p><strong>Q:</strong> What do you miss about your old life?</p>



<p><strong><strong>Bowen</strong>:</strong> The ability to make everyone who calls me happy. We had great products and we served people right and if they had a problem or ran out of product we would put it in a truck and drive it there. I can’t do that anymore. I can’t help everyone.</p>

<p><strong>Lisa Fitzpatrick</strong> is a clinical professor of medicine at George Washington University School of Medicine and Health Sciences in Washington, D.C. She launched the company Grapevine Health to promote health literacy. She is also a coronavirus vaccine trial volunteer.</p>



<p><strong>Q:</strong> What do you want people to know?</p>



<p><strong><strong>Fitzpatrick</strong>:</strong> I want people to know it’s always relevant to connect and listen to people. More than ever, the pandemic is showing how disconnected we are. The things I’m hearing on the street — is 5G transmitting coronavirus? Is there a chip in the vaccine? Is coronavirus real? — people are so distrustful of government and the health care system.</p>



<p><strong>Q: </strong>Why did you join a vaccine trial?</p>



<p><strong><strong>Fitzpatrick</strong>:</strong> One day, a gentleman said he didn’t want to have anything to do with Trump’s vaccine. When I asked him what would have to happen for him to decide to take the vaccine, he said, “I would consider it if I saw some other Black people working on it.” And I thought, well, I’ve been a research investigator. I’m a Black woman. I’m a physician. I can be a bridge between science and the community and let my experience speak.</p>



<p><strong>Q:</strong> What is making your job hard?</p>



<p><strong><strong>Fitzpatrick</strong>:</strong> Anything that’s wild and crazy spreads like wildfire. Credible messengers have to be part of the solution. When the lockdown first happened, people were texting me, calling me, sending me emails: Is this really true? Can you read this for me? Should I believe this? And I thought, I need to spring into action.</p>



<p><strong>Q: </strong>What gives you hope?</p>



<p><strong><strong>Fitzpatrick</strong>: </strong>I’m never without hope. Because this too shall pass. A lot of damage is being done right now, but I don’t know that it’s irreparable. Black people have survived slavery; American Indians have survived the genocide. We just have to figure out how to become more resilient and deal with it.</p>

<p><strong>Evan J. Anderson</strong> is a pediatric infectious disease specialist at Emory University School of Medicine, in Atlanta, which has been conducting trials of Moderna’s Covid-19 vaccine and others. He supports testing promising vaccine candidates in children.</p>



<p><strong>Q:</strong> Tell us about your experience.</p>



<p><strong><strong>Anderson</strong>:</strong> (Long pause) This has been a very challenging experience, having watched patients die with no therapeutic options. Now we have some major advances as far as helping to improve care. Patients are doing better than they did early in the pandemic and that’s been great.</p>



<p><strong>Q:</strong> What have you learned during the pandemic?</p>



<p><strong><strong>Anderson</strong>:</strong> That a focused approach by industry, academics and the government can result in dramatic improvements in being able to move vaccines forward from the laboratory into early phase and now late-phase clinical trials, shortening the timelines for conducting those studies and for getting data out and available to the public.</p>



<p><strong>Q:</strong> What has surprised you about the public’s response to the pandemic?</p>



<p><strong><strong>Anderson</strong>:</strong> The anti-science bent of segments of the population, and the antagonism toward basic public health interventions for decreasing SARS CoV-2 transmission. Plus the polls that indicate that a substantial percentage of the population will categorically refuse COVID-19 vaccines. That’s surprising. And discouraging, honestly.</p>



<p><strong>Q:</strong> What is making your job hard?</p>



<p><strong><strong>Anderson</strong>:</strong> Just the cumulative exhaustion. We ramped up the beginning of March to sprint pace, and now I’ve been going at that pace for [many] months. At a certain point, you just can’t keep sprinting any longer.</p>



<p><strong>Q: </strong>What gives you hope for the future?</p>



<p><strong><strong>Anderson</strong>:</strong> The high vaccine efficacy observed in the Moderna and Pfizer trials is really encouraging. If these vaccines (and potentially others as well) can be quickly distributed and people receive a highly effective vaccine, we will likely be seeing a return to a “new normal” sometime in 2021. To accomplish this, we still have much work to do, including evaluating these vaccines in pregnant women and children. There is much hope for better days ahead.</p>

Rasmussen</span></figure></div>



<p>Virologist <strong>Angela Rasmussen</strong> of Columbia University Mailman School of Public Health, is living in Seattle while doing research on SARS CoV-2. Trying to combat misinformation has become a big part of her job.</p>



<p><strong>Q:</strong> What do you want people to know about your experience?</p>



<p><strong><strong>Rasmussen</strong>: </strong>It’s been just as grueling for scientists as it has been for everybody else. It’s been incredibly frustrating and demoralizing to see expert advice — from epidemiologists, from physicians, from virologists like me — be ignored.</p>



<p><strong>Q: </strong>What have you learned during the pandemic?</p>



<p><strong><strong>Rasmussen</strong>: </strong>How one very small virus that we didn’t even know about until December 30 last year — and actually, didn’t know was a coronavirus until January 10 this year — could profoundly affect the entire human species.</p>



<p><strong>Q: </strong>What is making your job hard?</p>



<p><strong><strong>Rasmussen</strong>:</strong> The misinformation. It makes it 10 times harder for me to do my job if every time I write a paper, every time I write a perspective piece, every time I even <a href="https://twitter.com/angie_rasmussen">tweet something</a>, I have to think very carefully about what I say. Because it could be taken out of context and people could run with it in ways that are really harmful.</p>



<p><strong>Q: </strong>What gives you hope for the future?</p>



<p><strong><strong>Rasmussen</strong>:</strong> Those of us who work with emerging viruses — we all know each other. This has given me opportunities to meet people who are approaching some of the same problems, but from a very different professional perspective. And that has been really wonderful. Hopefully it’s going to lead to some great research.</p>



<p><strong>Q:</strong> What do you miss about your old life?</p>



<p><strong><strong>Rasmussen</strong>:</strong> I miss being able to think of my job as a job, and not as: What sort of crushing despair do I have to deal with today?</p>

Quade</span></figure></div>



<p><strong>Thomas Quade</strong> is health commissioner of Geauga County, Ohio, managing a team of about two dozen people who enforce state law to protect public health.</p>



<p><strong>Q:</strong> How has the pandemic changed your work?</p>



<p><strong><strong>Quade</strong>:</strong> Some of the work that we would normally do got put on hold. We didn’t start off the year with a lot of extra contact tracers and epidemiologists, for example, so we retrained our sanitarians, who normally inspect restaurants, to make COVID contact-tracing calls.</p>



<p><strong>Q:</strong> What do you want people to know about your experience?</p>



<p><strong><strong>Quade</strong>: </strong>Folks at local health departments — and this is not just mine, this is across the country — are working harder than they’ve ever worked. And they weren’t slacking before. Public health in this country has been lean for the last 15 years; in the 2008 recession we lost about 25 percent of the U.S. public health workforce and it has not been replenished.</p>



<p><strong>Q: </strong>What have you learned during the pandemic?</p>



<p><strong><strong>Quade</strong>:</strong> It reinforced that we really have to have relationships in the community. The United Way or YMCA, or your church or your school, can say the same things we would say, but it’s absorbed differently. We need those partners, otherwise the story is no longer about fighting the virus. The story is about fighting the people that are fighting the virus. And that’s not productive.</p>



<p><strong>Q: </strong>What has surprised you about the public’s response?</p>



<p><strong><strong>Quade</strong>:</strong> That we’re getting pushback on what are very simple strategies. These are things that parents tell little kids: wash your hands, stay home when you’re sick. What surprised me is how successfully this has been made political, that a mask says you’re for something or against something.</p>



<p><strong>Q:</strong> What gives you hope for the future?</p>



<p><strong><strong>Quade</strong>:</strong> (Long pause) What gives me hope is that, as tired and worn out as my colleagues are — not just here at this health department, but my national network of public health colleagues — they seem to have reserves of energy left. I think it’s because diehard public health professionals are mission-oriented. If it was just a job, none of us would be doing this.</p>

If the paywall sites are going to attract more consumers, and provide them safe harbor from the free-news vortex, then Radcliffe says they’ll need to make a better case for why it’s worth the money. That means letting people know the actual cost of producing journalism, and what’s at risk if you don’t financially support it. Otherwise, big publications will only serve a minority of the population, small publications will struggle to survive, and people who have grown accustomed to free news will continue to seek it out, even if it ends up not really being news at all.

<p>Any science journalist would rejoice at the revelation of aliens on Earth. It would be the story of a lifetime. So it’s not surprising that a former Israeli space official’s claim that <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/danidiplacido/2020/12/08/2020-looks-to-be-ending-with-a-bang-with-the-reveal-of-the-umm-galactic-federation/?sh=42e7ae7113d7">a Galactic Federation is known to the U.S. government</a> has made a few headlines and trended on Twitter.</p>



<p>Of course, most science journalists have already been alerted to the presence of aliens by any number of readers who would like to testify about their personal E.T. encounters.</p>



<p>Yet despite how desperately some science journalists wish for alien visitation to be real, few among us ever believe any such reports. Proper policy is to decline to interview any would-be informant about their alien experience and instead insist on interviewing the aliens themselves.</p>



<p>And so I would be willing to come out of retirement and conduct such an interview if any Galactic Federation alien monitoring <em>Science News</em> would be willing to submit to some tough questions. Only condition would be the alien must wear a high-quality mask, covering its damn nose if it has one.</p>





<p>Now, it’s a pretty safe bet that such an interview isn’t going to happen. It’s more likely that the Washington Football Team wins the next Super Bowl. Or even the New York Jets. But just in case, it’s a good idea to start preparing the questions. Here are my Top 10, followed by my best guesses at the alien’s answers. </p>



<h4>The questions:</h4>



<p>Q1. How do you spell your name?</p>



<p>Q2. Using Earth astronomical terminology, where are you from?</p>



<p>Q3. Have you not seen <em>The War of the Worlds</em>?</p>



<p>Q4. What is your favorite interpretation of quantum mechanics?</p>



<p>Q5. Are you in any way responsible for COVID-19 or any other serious disease-causing agent, and are you sorry?</p>



<p>Q6. When you looked at that dress, did it look black and blue or white and gold?</p>



<p>Q7. What particular scientific theoretical breakthrough enabled the technology you have exploited for interstellar travel?</p>



<p>Q8. Can you define P value correctly and explain its limitations for drawing scientific inferences?</p>



<p>Q9. What is the airspeed velocity of an unladen swallow?</p>



<p>Q10. Why in the world haven’t you provided us with sufficiently sophisticated algorithmic artificial intelligence to neutralize the damage to our civilization perpetrated by social media?</p>



<h4>And the possible answers:</h4>



<p><strong>Q1. How do you spell your name?</strong></p>



<p>A1. “Spell? There is no spell. There is name or not name.”</p>



<p>Hard to argue with that.</p>



<p><strong>Q2. Using Earth astronomical terminology, where are you from?</strong></p>



<p>A2. “<a href="https://exoplanets.nasa.gov/exoplanet-catalog/7423/teegardens-star-b/">Teegarden b</a>.”</p>



<p><strong>Q3. Have you not seen <em>The War of the Worlds</em>?</strong></p>



<p>A3. “Saw both versions. Tom Cruise is no Gene Barry. <em>Galaxy Quest</em> was a more realistic movie, though.”</p>



<p><strong>Q4. What is your favorite interpretation of quantum mechanics?</strong></p>



<p>A4. “Quantum mechanics needs no particular interpretation if it is formulated without the preexisting prejudice that nature should exhibit cause-and-effect determinism. It’s all about understanding the nature of time as a source of novelty rather than a continuous parameter dictating the evolution of a function. What you call randomness or indeterminism is what we call information creation. A few of your earthling scientists have begun to catch on a little bit to this idea. Check out <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2002.01653">arxiv.org/abs/2002.01653</a>.”</p>



<p><strong>Q5. Are you in any way responsible for COVID-19 or any other serious disease-causing agent, and are you sorry?</strong></p>



<p>A5. “Possibly we brought in a disease or two, but on the other hand, you hooked us on tobacco.”</p>



<p><strong>Q6. When you looked at that dress, did it look black and blue or white and gold?</strong></p>



<p>A6. “Hah! We invented that dress to keep you guys distracted from some other stuff we had going on.”</p>



<p><strong>Q7. What particular scientific theoretical breakthrough enabled the technology you have exploited for interstellar travel?</strong></p>



<p>A7. “Well, that’s related to the quantum question. The key insight came from the Vulcans, who realized that continuum mathematics at the foundation of calculus was not the only possible logical mathematical system. You need what you call intuitionistic math — as I mentioned, read <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2002.01653">arxiv.org/abs/2002.01653</a>. And also <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2011.02348">this paper</a>. Once you get rid of that unwieldy infinity of real numbers lots of things are easier to solve, like quantum gravity. Technology takes off from there.”</p>



<p>Vulcans? Well, right, this is the Galactic Federation.</p>



<p><strong>Q8. Can you define P value correctly and explain its limitations for drawing scientific inferences?</strong></p>



<p>A8. “Oh, we’ve been trying for years to feed you guys clues about how worthless P values are. We don’t allow any new worlds into the federation until their scientists stop using P values. A P value is the probability of getting an observed result or a more extreme result if the hypothesis of getting a null result is true, given the mathematical model of the data and all other assumptions built into your experiment. Doesn’t tell you a damn thing about whether the null hypothesis is true or not. Just gives a hint about whether your result is surprising or not. It could be surprising and therefore wrong or could be surprising and right. Go read <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10654-016-0149-3">this paper</a>.”</p>



<p>I did.</p>



<p><strong>Q9. What is the airspeed velocity of an unladen swallow?</strong></p>



<p>A9. “What do you mean?”</p>



<p>Only half credit for that — it’s not the whole answer.</p>



<p><strong>Q10. Why in the world haven’t you provided us with sufficiently sophisticated algorithmic artificial intelligence to neutralize the damage to our civilization perpetrated by social media?</strong></p>



<p>Alien runs off.</p>



<p>OMG, I just realized the answer to that one is that Zuckerberg is one of the aliens.</p>

<p>As a short modeling session for an electrophysiology course at the University of Zurich, I made a  tutorial for students to play around with the Hodgkin-Huxley equations in a Colab Notebook / Python, which does not require them to install Python. You’ll find the code online on a small Github repository: <a href="https://github.com/PTRRupprecht/Hodgkin-Huxley-CC-VC" rel="nofollow">https://github.com/PTRRupprecht/Hodgkin-Huxley-CC-VC</a></p>



<p>Using the code, the students can not only play around with the Hodgkin-Huxley equations, but also replicate in silico the experiments they have done when patching cells in slices (including voltage clamp experiment).</p>



<p>It is really rewarding to be able to reproduce current clamp (recording the membrane potential) and voltage clamp experiments (recording the currents while clamping the voltage to a constant value), because this also allows to replicate computationally the experiments and plots generated experimentally by <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1392413/">Hodgkin and Huxley</a>.</p>



<p>Below, you see a part of the code, the result of a simulation of a Hodgkin-Huxley model. The top configuration was run in current clamp, with a current pulse injected between 40 and 80 ms, which triggered a single action potential. The lower configuration was run in voltage clamp, with the holding potential stepping from -70 mV to -30 mV between 40 and 80 ms. You can clearly see the active conductanves (deactivating sodium conductance in blue and non-deactivating potassium conductance in orange):</p>

                <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/climate-change-arctic-warming-noaa-report-card-2020">In the past 15 years, climate change has transformed the Arctic</a></h4>

<p>Fifteen years of grading warming’s impact on the Arctic has made one thing abundantly clear: Climate change has drastically altered the Arctic in that short time period.</p>



<p>Breaking unfortunate records is “like whack-a-mole,” says Jackie Richter-Menge, a climate scientist at the University of Alaska Fairbanks and an editor of the <a href="https://arctic.noaa.gov/Report-Card/Report-Card-2020">2020 Arctic Report Card</a>, released December 8 at the virtual meeting of the American Geophysical Union. From sea ice lows to temperature highs, records keep popping up all over the place. For instance, in June, a <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/siberia-verkhoyansk-record-heat-wave-arctic-circle">record-high 38° Celsius (100.4° Fahrenheit) temperature</a> was recorded in the Arctic Circle (<em>SN:6/23/20</em>). And in 2018, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/climate-change-bering-sea-ice-winter-melt-lowest-level">winter ice on the Bering Sea shrank</a> to a 5,500 year low (<em>SN:9/3/20</em>).</p>



<p>“But quite honestly, the biggest headline is the persistence and robustness of the warming,” Richter-Menge says. In 2007, only a year after the first Arctic Report Card, summer sea ice reached a record low, shrinking to an area 1.6 million square kilometers smaller than the previous year. Then, only five years later, the report card noted a new low, 18 percent below 2007. In 2020, sea ice didn’t set a record but not for lack of trying: It still was the second lowest on record in the last 42 years.  </p>



<p>“The transformation of the Arctic to a warmer, less frozen and biologically changed region is well under way,” the report concludes. And it’s changing faster than expected when researchers launched the report card in 2006. The annual average air temperature in the Arctic is rising two to three times faster than the rest of the globe, Richter-Menge says. Over the last 20 years, it’s warmed at a rate of 0.77 degrees C per decade, compared with the global average of 0.29 degrees C per decade.</p>





<p>Improvements in research techniques over the last 15 years have helped researchers more thoroughly observe warming’s impact and how different aspects of Arctic climate change are linked to one another, she says. These improvements include the ability to measure ice mass via gravity measurements taken by the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) satellite. Other satellites have provided additional observations from above while on-the-ground measurements, such as by the Multidisciplinary drifting Observatory for the Study of Arctic Climate (MOSAiC), have <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/arctic-winter-night-food-web-life-microbes-expedition-north-pole">provided up-close sea ice measurements</a> (<em>SN:4/8/20</em>). The report has also begun to include on-the-ground <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/arctic-report-card-how-poor-environmental-health-affects-everyday-life">observations of the Arctic’s Indigenous people</a>, who experience these changes directly (<em>SN:12/11/19</em>).</p>



<p>The changes have revealed few bright spots but one is the rebound of bowhead whales, which were hunted almost to extinction around the turn of the 20th century. While researchers are careful to note that the whales are still vulnerable, the four populations of the whales (<em>Balaena mysticetus</em>) now range from 218 in the Okhotsk Sea to around 16,800 in the Bering, Chukchi and Beaufort seas. Researchers suggest that the whales’ rebound is due, at least in part, to the warming that has occurred over the last 30 years. Earlier sea ice melting and warmer surface water means more krill and other food for these baleen feeders.</p>

<p>But don’t be fooled. The potential good news is overshadowed by the bad news. There’s been “this accumulation of knowledge and insights that we’ve gained over 15 years,” says Mark Serreze, a climate scientist at the National Snow and Ice Data Center in Boulder, Colo., who wasn’t involved in this year’s report. The 2020 research is “an exclamation point on the changes that have been unfolding,” he says. “The bowhead whales are doing OK, but that’s about it.”</p>

<p>Two giant, mysterious bubbles spew from the Milky Way’s heart, and now it appears the bubbles may have doubles.</p>



<p>Scientists have known for a decade that two bubbles of charged particles, or plasma, flank the plane of the Milky Way. Those structures, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/milky-ways-black-hole-may-blow-bubbles">known as the Fermi bubbles</a> after the telescope that detected them, are visible in high-energy light called gamma rays (<em>SN: 11/9/10</em>). But now, the eROSITA X-ray telescope has revealed larger bubbles, seen in X-rays. The X-ray bubbles extend about <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2979-0">45,000 light-years above and below the center of the galaxy</a>, researchers report online December 9 in <em>Nature</em>.</p>



<p>Previously, researchers had seen an <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/xray-map-sky-erosita-telescope-milky-way">X-ray arc</a> above the galactic plane (<em>SN: 7/8/20</em>). But no such feature was evident below the plane of the galaxy. That lack of symmetry led some scientists to discount the possibility of X-ray bubbles. With the new results, “this argument now has fallen,” says study coauthor Andrea Merloni, an astronomer at the Max Planck Institute for Extraterrestrial Physics in Garching, Germany. The eROSITA data reveal a faint and previously unknown bubble below the galactic plane, and a matching bubble above. The gamma-ray bubbles are nested inside the X-ray bubbles, suggesting that the two features are connected, says Merloni.</p>



<p>Studying the bubbles could help reveal violent events that may have taken place in the galaxy’s past. The supermassive black hole at the center of the Milky Way is currently fairly quiet, as far as black holes go. But a past feeding frenzy might have spewed its leftovers outward, forming the structures. Or the bubbles could have been the result of a period when many stars formed and exploded in the galaxy’s heart. Further study of the X-ray and gamma-ray bubbles could help reveal the cause.</p>

<p><em>By</em> <a href="https://twitter.com/mattbwarren">Matthew Warren</a></p>



<p>When it comes to memory for music, humans show an interesting quirk: we’re better at remembering melodies that are sung by voice, compared to those played on an instrument. Even a melody sung without any lyrics — just a series of <em>la la las</em>, for instance — becomes lodged in our memory in a way that a tune played on the piano, say, does not.</p>



<span id="more-40981"></span>



<p>Now a <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0010027720303334">new study published in <em>Cognition</em></a> has looked into <em>why </em>our memory is so much better for sung melodies. Researchers have suggested that listening to a voice singing a melody leads us to perform “subvocalisations” — internal speech that involves tiny movements of the muscles involved in speaking (you’re probably doing it right now as you read this text). But we can’t mimic an instrumental piece in the same way. After all, it’s easy to repeat “la la la” in your head, but not to reproduce the sound of piano keys.</p>



<p>Psychologists already know that this kind of silent rehearsal boosts memory for words — and that memory is impaired if we speak or make movements of the mouth and tongue, which interferes with these subvocalisations. So, theorised Michael Weiss and colleagues at the University of Montreal, if a similar process is responsible for our superior memory for vocal melodies, then people’s memory should be compromised if they make other mouth movements or sounds while listening.</p>



<p>In the first study, the team asked 38 participants to listen to 24 melodies, which were based on British and Irish folk tunes. Half of the tunes were played on the piano, and half were sung (as “la la la”). While listening to the melodies, half of the participants chewed gum vigorously, while the others squeezed a bean bag with their hand.</p>



<p>After taking a break to fill in questionnaires, the participants then completed a surprise recognition task, in which they heard the same 24 melodies as well as 24 new ones. They simply had to indicate whether or not they had heard each tune previously.</p>



<p>Similar to the findings of past work, participants were better at recognising the vocal melodies than the piano ones. But this “voice advantage” was the same whether participants had been chewing gum or squeezing the bean bag while listening. That is, the chewing motion — which uses the same muscles as articulating a word— had no effect on participants’ memory, suggesting that silent rehearsal <em>wasn’t</em> responsible for their superior recognition of the sung tunes.</p>



<p>Still, chewing gum is considerably different from actually mouthing words or making sounds, so might not be enough to interfere with any subvocalisations. So next, the team asked a new group of participants to either mouth “la” over and over again (without making any noise), or make a humming sound. In a subsequent study, participants whispered “la la la”.</p>



<p>In both studies, participants still recognised the vocal melodies better than the piano ones, despite making mouth movements or sounds. This again suggested that silent rehearsal of the sung melodies wasn’t responsible for boosting participants’ memories.</p>



<p>It’s worth noting that there wasn’t a control group in either of these studies, which makes it hard to completely rule out the possibility that making mouth movements or sounds could have <em>reduced</em> memory for vocal melodies, even if it didn’t entirely get rid of the memory advantage over instrumental tunes. However, the team did compare their results with an earlier study, in which participants listened to vocal and instrumental melodies <em>without</em> doing a task, and found no difference in memory performance between the two papers.</p>



<p>Overall, then, the studies suggest that our superior memory for sung melodies isn’t down to internal, silent rehearsal of the tunes. So what could explain the effect? Well, perhaps it’s just that humans are more attuned to voices than other sounds, the authors say. “The best current account of the voice advantage in memory remains that the voice is special, by virtue of being a conspecific, communicative, and biological signal, which is more engaging or distinctive to listeners than instrumental sounds,” they conclude.</p>

<p><em>Improving two-color calcium imaging… Surprising evolutionary changes in interneuron types… Exploring how the basal ganglia multitasks behavior… Using mathematical models to study bat echolocation…</em></p>
<p><span id="more-2826"></span></p>
<p><strong>A new variant of the calcium indicator improves two-photon imaging</strong></p>
<p>Two-photon (2P) calcium imaging has emerged as the leading method for <em>in vivo</em> brain imaging. However, the light sources commonly used (titanium-sapphire lasers and parametric oscillators) are quite costly, require frequent maintenance, and lack output power. One solution is to use inexpensive and powerful industrial lasers that have wavelengths around 1,000 nm. But to use these inexpensive lasers, new biosensors that excite above this wavelength are needed. To these ends, researchers have been working on creating new genetically encoded calcium indicators by taking advantage of mutations that can occur in green fluorescent protein (GFP) that convert it to a yellow fluorescent protein (YFP). <a href="https://www.janelia.org/lab/podgorski-lab">Dr. Kaspar Podgorski<strong></strong></a><strong><a href="https://www.ninds.nih.gov/exit_disclaimer"><img alt="external link" src="https://brainupdateblog.files.wordpress.com/2015/01/external_link_20x20.png?w=1540" style="height: 10px; width: 10px; background: none !important; border: none !important;" title="This graphic notice means that you are leaving an NINDS website. Click to view our external website policy." /></a></strong> and his team have created jYCaMP1 — a redshifted variant of jGCaMP7 — an optimized calcium indicator. Dr. Podgorski’s lab is a part of the Janelia Research Campus at the Howard Hughes Medical Institute. Their recent <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32451475/">paper shows that jYCaMP1 outperforms jGCaMP7 in both mice and flies and enables improved two-color calcium imaging with red fluorescent protein-based indicators</a>. When the researchers visualized activity within the mouse visual cortex, compared to jGCaMP7s, recordings from jYCaMP1s-labeled neurons were 1.8-fold as bright. Flies were also studied for a comparative analysis. When activity in the medulla of the optic lobe of flies was visualized, jYCaMP1s-labeled neurons showed 2.3-fold increases in brightness under 1,030 nm excitation compared to the jGCaMP7s-labeled neurons. One of the most exciting results of this study is that this new calcium indicator improves two-color imaging. This is because the shifted excitation spectrum of jYCaMP1 greatly improves the overlap with red genetically encoded fluorescent Ca<sup>2+</sup> indicators, such as jRGECO1a, while still retaining well-separated emission with red sensors. This is critical because this new calcium indicator now allows for dual color 2P Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging with a single excitation laser. Technological advances like this are, without a doubt, the future of <em>in vivo </em>imaging of neural activity.</p>

<p><strong>Evolution and the innovative variation of interneurons across species</strong></p>
<p>While primates and rodents had a common evolutionary ancestor approximately 90 million years ago, profound differences exist in both behavior and cognitive capacity between primates and rodents. However, the cellular basis for these differences is unknown. Moreover, rodents such as mice are frequently used to understand cell types within the brain. Until now, it has been unclear whether or not these cell types have been conserved or if they have changed across evolution. In the present study, researchers sought to systemically characterize interneuron cell-type RNA expression across a variety of species. This study was led by senior researcher and professor at Harvard University, <a href="http://mccarrolllab.org/">Dr. Steven McCarroll<strong></strong></a><strong><a href="https://www.ninds.nih.gov/exit_disclaimer"><img alt="external link" src="https://brainupdateblog.files.wordpress.com/2015/01/external_link_20x20.png?w=1540" style="height: 10px; width: 10px; background: none !important; border: none !important;" title="This graphic notice means that you are leaving an NINDS website. Click to view our external website policy." /></a></strong>. Dr. McCarroll and his team used single-nucleus RNA sequencing to profile RNA expression in 188,776 individual interneurons across homologous brain regions of three primate species (i.e., human, macaque, and marmoset), mice, and ferrets. This <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32999462/">paper shows that homologous interneuron types, readily identified by their RNA-expression patterns, varied in both abundance and RNA expression among ferrets, mice, and primates</a>. As expected, this variance was lower among primates. Researchers predicted that the primate caudal ganglionic eminence (CGE) – a subcortical progenitor zone that gives rise to interneurons during neurodevelopment – would contain greater evolutionary novelties among interneurons because the CGE produces a larger proportion of these cells in primates than in rodents. However, they found that the divergence in the cortex, hippocampus, and striatum of the primate species all involved interneurons for which RNA-expression patterns indicated they originated from the medial ganglionic eminence (MGE) domain, which is evolutionarily older than the CGE domain. Further, the team found a primate interneuron cell-type that has no homologous counterpart in mice or ferrets in the striatum, and not the cortex. Overall, this research is important because it broadens our understanding of the evolution of interneurons. Further, these findings will facilitate research for the treatment of neuropsychiatric illnesses by helping scientists identify the species that best models cell types in the human brain.</p>

<p><strong>Projections of the basal ganglia: beyond an integrative hub</strong></p>
<p>There are primarily two models to explain the function of the basal ganglia, which are important nuclei involved in decision making and motor control. One model suggests this set of nuclei is a site of integration, whereas the second model suggests that projections from the basal ganglia are divided into topographical channels, each controlling a distinct behavior. The lab of <a href="https://sabatini.hms.harvard.edu/">Dr. Bernardo Sabatini<strong></strong></a><strong><a href="https://www.ninds.nih.gov/exit_disclaimer"><img alt="external link" src="https://brainupdateblog.files.wordpress.com/2015/01/external_link_20x20.png?w=1540" style="height: 10px; width: 10px; background: none !important; border: none !important;" title="This graphic notice means that you are leaving an NINDS website. Click to view our external website policy." /></a></strong> investigated the latter hypothesis by using a unique experimental approach. One part of the basal ganglia, the striatum, has functionally discrete roles along the medial–lateral axis, with dorsal medial striatum and dorsal lateral striatum involved in goal-directed and habitual behaviors, respectively. Dr. Sabatini’s new <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32989293/">paper suggests that this dichotomy might arise, at least partially, from distinct anatomical projections from the basal ganglia that allow parallel modulation of behavior</a>. In other words, rather than integrating behavior on their own, the basal ganglia multitask through multiple feedforward projections to other regions. Researchers first used anterograde tracers to map the projection pathways of the basal ganglia. Next, using an optogenetic approach, they confirmed that specific regions within the striatum triggered a single behavior (licking or locomotion). Further, when the locomotion-inducing striatal region was stimulated while mice were licking, this did not interfere with licking. These findings support the canonical parallel model of basal ganglia activity, but also suggest that the integration and competition of information associated with specific behaviors occurs largely outside of the basal ganglia. Altogether, this work extends our understanding of the basal ganglia as a complex brain region with distinct neural projections that function independently. Understanding the functional composition of these circuits is a critical step toward a better understanding of basal ganglia-related disorders, such as Huntington’s disease and Parkinson’s disease.</p>

<p><strong>Bats use echolocation to predict their prey’s movements</strong></p>
<p>It is well established that bats use echolocation to track moving auditory objects, such as prey, within their environment. But are bats actually using predictive tracking strategies to anticipate the future? <a href="https://batlab.johnshopkins.edu/index.html">Dr. Cynthia Moss</a><strong><a href="https://www.ninds.nih.gov/exit_disclaimer"><img alt="external link" src="https://brainupdateblog.files.wordpress.com/2015/01/external_link_20x20.png?w=1540" style="height: 10px; width: 10px; background: none !important; border: none !important;" title="This graphic notice means that you are leaving an NINDS website. Click to view our external website policy." /></a></strong> and her team at Johns Hopkins University study comparative neural systems and behavior using the big brown bat (<em>Eptesicus fuscus)</em> as a model organism. Dr. Moss and her “Batlab” team show in their <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33139550/">new paper that bats integrate information across echo sequences to anticipate a target’s future position in a three-dimensional environment</a>. To show this, the Batlab created a carefully controlled laboratory environment. They first trained bats to sit on a platform in this lab environment while the researchers manipulated the path of the insect the bats would chase. In this setting, the researchers could control the speed at which the insect moved, and high-speed cameras were used to track the movement of the bats. Then, they measured the direction of the bat’s head (i.e. sonar beam aim) and echolocation call rate as it tracked the moving target within its sonar field. The team then used four separate mathematical models to determine whether or not the bats used predictive tracking behaviors while chasing the insect target. Indeed, they found that bats use a predictive internal model to update tracking of a moving target. The results held true even when tested in a more naturalistic environment that included an object that the moving target could hide behind temporarily. By studying bats and other unique model organisms, we can better understand how humans and other animals use their own sensory information in order to make predictions about the future. Research such as this can have important implications about how individuals who are blind navigate within their environment and how we can create better devices to assist the visually impaired.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coronavirus-covid-19-pandemic-questions-2020">As 2020 comes to an end, here’s what we still don’t know about COVID-19</a></h4>

<p class="has-drop-cap has-medium-font-size">More than 68 million infected with the novel coronavirus and more than 1.5 million dead. 2020 has been a year defined by global sickness and loss.</p>



<p>In the face of this extraordinary threat, it’s easy to forget how much we have accomplished. Doctors, nurses and staff in hospitals around the world have learned how to better care for those sick with COVID-19. Researchers have uncovered secrets of a virus that, not so long ago, was wholly unknown.</p>



<p>Accelerated efforts to create vaccines succeeded beyond even the most optimistic predictions, with the United Kingdom granting emergency use of a vaccine on December 2 and the United States poised to follow suit before the end of the year.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, public health officials have fought to inform the public about how to reduce the risk of infection amid an onslaught of false reports about cures and treatments, and denials about the pandemic’s severity. Millions of people have donned masks and dramatically reshaped their daily lives to help fight the virus.</p>



<p>In early January, we had no tests for detecting the virus, no treatments, no vaccines. And though we’re not where we want to be, we’ve made progress on all those fronts. But we still have so much to learn. Here are pressing questions that scientists seek to answer. — <em>Emily DeMarco</em></p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><figure class="wp-block-image"><img alt="woman in a nursing home in Tokyo" class="wp-image-3094194" height="450" src="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/121902_covid-q_inline1_680-661x450.jpg" width="661" /><span class="credit wp-credit-3094194">Atsushi Taketazu/Yomiuri Shimbun via AP Images</span></figure>During the pandemic, family and friends wishing to visit nursing home residents, among the most vulnerable to severe disease, often must wave from behind glass, as in this May image from Tokyo.

<h4>Why do some people get sick while others don’t?</h4>





<p>A person’s age and preexisting medical conditions are risk factors for more severe disease, and <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coronavirus-covid-19-kills-more-men-than-women-why-immune-system">men appear to be at higher risk than women</a> (<em>SN: 4/23/20</em>). But scientists don’t have many answers to explain the wide variety of experiences people have with SARS-CoV-2, the coronavirus that causes COVID-19. Many people have no symptoms. Some struggle to breathe, suffer strokes, or progress to organ failure and death.</p>



<p>People who develop severe disease do have something in common: “a very severe inflammatory response,” says cancer immunologist Miriam Merad of the Ichan School of Medicine at Mount Sinai in New York City. The body’s own <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/covid-19-coronavirus-immune-system-early-treatment-interferon">immune response can get out of whack </a>and inflict inflammatory damage in a misguided attempt to make things right (<em>SN: 8/29/20, p. 8</em>).</p>



<p>Scientists have begun to pick out immune system players that seem to gum up the works during a severe bout of COVID-19. For example, a problem can arise with type 1 interferons, proteins that kick off the initial immune response to an intruder and activate production of pathogen-destroying antibodies. Patients with severe COVID-19 can have a weak interferon response; in some patients, genetic errors can interfere with the production of interferons, in others, the immune system <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/covid-19-coronavirus-genetics-immune-responses-severe-cases">incapacitates the proteins</a> (<em>SN: 9/25/20</em>).</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img alt="lung x-ray" class="wp-image-3094193" height="576" src="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/121902_covid-q_inline2_680.jpg" width="680" /><span class="caption wp-caption-3094193">A chest X-ray of a patient with COVID-19 pneumonia shows the telltale white areas, or densities, in the lungs.</span><span class="credit wp-credit-3094193">Hellerhoff/Wikimedia Commons (<a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/">CC BY-SA 3.0</a>)</span></figure>



<p>Meanwhile, some severely sick people produce an excess of other components of the body’s early immune response. In nearly 1,500 people hospitalized with COVID-19, Merad and colleagues measured four immune proteins that contribute to inflammation. High levels of two of the proteins, interleukin-6 and TNF alpha, predicted that a patient would go on to <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-1051-9">have severe illness and possibly die</a>, even after accounting for age, sex and underlying medical conditions, the researchers reported in August in<em> Nature Medicine</em>.</p>



<p>It may be that people with no or mild symptoms have some degree of preexisting immunity. Some people who haven’t been exposed to SARS-CoV-2 have white blood cells called T cells that nonetheless recognize the virus. This appears to be <a href="https://science.sciencemag.org/content/370/6512/89?ijkey=37475f2f1c77974248b97a479654a39e9a9235cd&amp;keytype2=tf_ipsecsha">due to past colds from common coronaviruses</a>, researchers reported in October in<em> Science</em>. They speculated that this preexisting T cell immunity may contribute to differences in COVID-19 disease severity. — <em>Aimee Cunningham</em></p>



<h4>What are the long-term health consequences of an infection?</h4>



<p>This question could take years to resolve.</p>



<p>For now, we know that for some people, the symptoms and suffering from COVID-19 <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coronavirus-pandemic-six-months-covid-19-symptoms">can go on for months after the initial infection</a> (<em>SN: 7/2/20</em>). There isn’t an agreed-upon definition for what some call “post-COVID syndrome” or “long COVID,” but symptoms tend to include fatigue, shortness of breath, brain fog and heart abnormalities. And these problems aren’t necessarily tied to a more severe initial illness.</p>



<p>It’s not yet clear how widespread the syndrome is or what to do about it. But studies are beginning to offer clues as to how common persistent illness is. Of 143 patients in Italy who had been hospitalized with COVID-19, <a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2768351">32 percent had one or two symptoms</a> and 55 percent had three or more symptoms an average of two months after first feeling sick, researchers reported in August in <em>JAMA</em>. And in a survey of 274 symptomatic adults who had a positive test for SARS-CoV-2 but weren’t hospitalized, <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/69/wr/mm6930e1.htm">35 percent were not back to their normal state of health</a> two to three weeks after testing, according to a July study in <em>Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report</em>.</p>



<p>One of the largest surveys so far comes from the COVID Symptom Study, in which people logged their symptoms into an app. Of 4,182 users with COVID-19, <a href="https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.10.19.20214494v1">13.3 percent had symptoms lasting more than four weeks</a>, 4.5 percent had symptoms for more than eight weeks and 2.3 percent topped 12 weeks. The risk of persistent symptoms rose with age, researchers reported in October in a preliminary study posted at medRxiv.org.</p>

<p>To learn about the long-term physical and mental health effects of COVID-19, the U.S. National Institutes of Health plans to follow for months to years people who have been infected. And a trial by Steven Deeks, an internal medicine physician at the University of California, San Francisco School of Medicine, and colleagues will assess the role of inflammation in persistent health effects.</p>



<p>Long-term studies of entire communities will be especially important to learn how common persistent symptoms are, how long they last and why they’re happening, Deeks says. “Right now, we have just a whole long list of questions,” he says. “It’s going to take a lot to figure this out.” — <em>Aimee Cunningham</em></p>



<h4>How long might immunity last?</h4>



<p>There are signs that the immune system can learn how to deal with the virus, bestowing at least temporary immunity. Most people appear to make immune proteins that stop SARS-CoV-2 in its tracks, called neutralizing antibodies, and also T cells that help coordinate the immune response or kill infected cells, says epidemiologist Aubree Gordon of the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor. Those antibodies and T cells can stick around in the body for at least six months, if not longer, studies suggest. “So that’s promising,” Gordon says.</p>



<p>But scientists don’t know how long a person will be protected from a future bout with the virus. “There’s just been a limited time for people to study this,” she says.</p>



<p>Still, SARS-CoV-2 is not the only coronavirus that infects people. For instance, four others that cause the common cold circulate around the globe. “We can get some evidence from what goes on with some of the human endemic coronaviruses,” says immunologist Brianne Barker of Drew University in Madison, N.J. For those viruses, <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-1083-1">protection lasts about a year</a>. People can get infected with the same virus over and over again once their immunity wears off, though the severity of a second infection varies. The duration of immunity after an infection with the coronaviruses that cause SARS and MERS is unknown.</p>



<p>To date, there have been a few documented reinfections with SARS-CoV-2, suggesting that, for some, immunity doesn’t last very long. Efforts — including a study Gordon is working on — are under way to figure out how common reinfection really is and whether subsequent infections are any different from the initial one. — <em>Erin Garcia de Jesus</em></p>



<h4>What can we expect from the treatments and vaccines being developed?</h4>



<p>Because of crucial advances in 2020, “we know more about the virus and some of the complications it causes and how to prevent and predict and treat those complications,” says Amesh Adalja, an infectious disease physician at Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security.</p>



<p>Doctors have learned tricks that help people breathe easier, such as putting hospitalized COVID-19 patients on their stomachs. And two drugs — the antiviral remdesivir and the <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/steroid-dexamethasone-reduce-covid-19-coronavirus-deaths">steroid dexamethasone</a> — have shown promise against the virus (<em>SN: 6/16/20</em>). The U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved remdesivir for use in hospitalized COVID-19 patients ages 12 and older in October because some studies showed that it can shorten hospital stays. But the drug, which is the only FDA-approved drug for COVID-19, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/covid-19-coronavirus-remdesivir-who-hydroxychloroquine-interferon-lopinavir-solidarity">didn’t reduce the chance of dying or going on a ventilator</a> in a large study by the World Health Organization (<em>SN: 10/16/20</em>).</p>



<p>In November, the FDA gave a cancer drug called baricitinib emergency use authorization. In combination with remdesivir, the drug shaved an extra day off hospital stays compared with remdesivir alone in a large clinical trial. But many doctors aren’t convinced of baricitinib’s effectiveness.</p>



<p>Ideally, doctors could treat people before they are sick enough to need the hospital. Some drugs are in early stage clinical trials to determine if they can <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coronavirus-covid-19-new-early-treatments">help people early in an infection</a> (<em>SN: 9/26/20, p. 8</em>). Some antibodies taken from COVID-19 survivors and lab-made antibodies <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/covid-19-coronavirus-antibodies-lab-treatment-immune-system">are also being put to the test</a> (<em>SN: 9/22/20</em>). Lab-made antibodies from Eli Lilly and Company and Regeneron were given emergency use authorization in November for treating people newly diagnosed with COVID-19, making the therapies the first available to people who aren’t ill enough to go to the hospital. (Regeneron Pharmaceuticals is a major donor to the Society for Science &amp; the Public, which publishes<em> Science News</em>.)</p>



<p>Vaccines are being developed on a fast track. Russia was the <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coronavirus-covid-19-russia-vaccine-testing">first country to announce it had a vaccine</a> for the public, though scientists question its efficacy (<em>SN: 8/11/20</em>). China has also given the nod for emergency use of some vaccines for the military (<em>SN: 8/1/20, p. 6</em>) and general public, although those vaccines are still in testing too. The United Arab Emirates authorized two vaccines made in China for use by its citizens.</p>



<p>Both Pfizer and Moderna announced in November that their mRNA-based vaccines were about <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coronavirus-covid19-vaccine-pfizer-biontech-final-results">95 percent effective at preventing illness</a> (<em>SN: 11/16/20</em>; <em>SN: 11/18/20</em>). On December 2, the <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coronavirus-covid-19-vaccine-pfizer-uk-first-approval">United Kingdom OK’d Pfizer’s vaccine</a> for emergency use, making the vaccine the first to get the nod after thorough testing. AstraZeneca and the University of Oxford reported that their vaccine prevents illness too, and <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coronavirus-covid-19-oxford-astrazeneca-vaccine-effective">may cut down on transmission of the virus</a> (<em>SN: 11/23/20</em>).</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img alt="Researchers at BioNTech" class="wp-image-3094192" height="487" src="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/121902_covid-q_inline3_680.jpg" width="680" /><span class="caption wp-caption-3094192">Researchers at BioNTech in Mainz, Germany (shown) and at Pfizer developed a COVID-19 vaccine that is reported to be 95 percent effective at preventing illness.</span><span class="credit wp-credit-3094192">Abdulhamid Hosbas/Anadolu Agency via Getty Images</span></figure>



<p>Over 200 other vaccines are in development worldwide, says Esther Krofah, executive director of FasterCures, part of the Milken Institute think tank. But getting doses of a vaccine, at least initially, “will not be as straightforward as calling up your local CVS,” she says.</p>



<p>In the United States, 21 million health care workers and about 3 million people living in long-term care facilities are expected to be <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coronavirus-covid-19-who-should-get-vaccines-first">first in line for the vaccines</a> (<em>SN: 12/1/20</em>). Children may be among the last to be immunized. That’s because vaccines haven’t been tested in kids under 12, and children are less likely to die or develop severe disease than adults.</p>



<p>Bottom line: A COVID-19 vaccine may not be widely available in the United States until late spring or summer 2021.</p>



<p>Even when a vaccine is approved for broad use and there’s a large enough supply, “the bigger challenge will come in distributing vaccines widely,” says Julie Swann, a health systems engineer at North Carolina State University in Raleigh. Pfizer’s vaccine, for instance, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/covid19-coronavirus-vaccine-last-mile-logistics-pfizer-moderna">has to be kept frozen at supercold temperatures</a>. So distributors must either be able to give out all of their doses within a couple of days after receiving a shipment, or have access to special freezers or dry ice to keep the vaccines cold enough. Big cities may have more access to those measures than rural areas.</p>



<p>Many of the vaccines in testing require two doses. Keeping track of who has gotten which vaccine and when it’s time for a booster, and whether booster shots are available, could also be challenging, Swann says. — <em>Tina Hesman Saey</em></p>



<h4>Will the pandemic end in 2021?</h4>



<p>“I don’t think anyone can say with clarity what the end of the pandemic might look like,” says Michael Osterholm, an epidemiologist at the University of Minnesota in Minneapolis. If a vaccine can confer long-lasting immunity, on the order of years to decades, widespread community transmission around the globe could cease, he says.</p>



<p>But “a vaccine is nothing until it becomes a vaccination in somebody’s arm,” Osterholm says. And those arms must be willing. Vaccine development has <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coronavirus-covid-19-vaccine-clinical-trials-speed-safety">progressed at a record pace</a>, but some experts worry that speed, and the politicization of certain drugs, have seeded distrust (<em>SN: 8/1/20, p. 6</em>). “Acceptance is going to be a huge issue,” he says.</p>



<p>Of course, many countries managed to slow the virus’ spread without a vaccine. In the United States, “we don’t have to wait to get this under control,” says public health researcher Megan Ranney of Brown University in Providence, R.I. “We already know that basic, multimodal public health interventions work.”</p>



<p>Such interventions include widespread and easily accessible testing that spurs contact tracing and case isolation, as well as consistent public health messaging around the importance of wearing masks, social distancing and avoiding crowded indoor spaces.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img alt="passengers on a flight from Athens" class="wp-image-3094191" height="453" src="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/121902_covid-q_inline4_680.jpg" width="680" /><span class="caption wp-caption-3094191">To reduce the risk of virus transmission, many airlines require passengers and crew to wear masks. This flight was leaving Athens on August 13, as COVID-19 cases in Greece rose sharply.</span><span class="credit wp-credit-3094191">Nicolas Economou/Nurphoto via AP</span></figure>



<p>Thus far in the United States, these basic public health interventions have been <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coronavirus-covid-19-united-states-wasted-time-lockdowns-reopening">patchy and inadequate on a national scale</a> (<em>SN: 7/1/20</em>). That’s allowed the “first wave” of infections to slosh around the country, growing in size to about 200,000 new cases each day in early December. Whether this dire trend worsens in the early months of 2021 depends in large part on federal action, both Osterholm and Ranney say.</p>



<p>“We need a national plan, and we don’t have a national plan,” Osterholm says. That may change with the election of Joe Biden, who campaigned on creating a coronavirus national plan. Osterholm is part of the president-elect’s <a href="https://buildbackbetter.com/press-releases/biden-harris-transition-announces-covid-19-advisory-board/">Transition COVID-19 Advisory Board</a>, which has begun planning a new federal response.</p>



<p>Broadly, that plan includes clear and consistent public health messaging, a well-funded national testing strategy, support for states to boost contact tracing, supplying personal protective equipment to essential workers and mask mandates. “If we have all those things in place, the coming year could be somewhat similar to where we’ll be with widespread vaccination,” Ranney says. People could go about most normal activities with a little extra caution, wearing masks and avoiding crowds indoors.</p>



<p>Still, measures like universal mask wearing, social distancing and contact tracing only work if people abide by them. As the pandemic wears on, experts worry that complacency and fatigue could further fracture an already uneven response to the disease.</p>



<p>If the United States “continues on the path we’re on now, we’re going to continue to see increasing numbers of people hospitalized and dead, continue to go through this seesaw of full lockdown then full reopening, confusing messages, unmitigated anxiety and fear and a worsening economy,” Ranney says. — <em>Jonathan Lambert</em></p>



<h4>Once the pandemic ends, will the virus still circulate?</h4>



<p>When the pandemic eventually fizzles out, <a href="https://science.sciencemag.org/content/370/6516/527">the coronavirus itself will probably stick around for a while</a>, experts say. How long, however, depends on how well our immune system and available vaccines protect us from reinfection.</p>



<p>So far, it’s impossible to say how frequently reinfections with SARS-CoV-2 happen based on the small number of these cases identified. But if reinfections become common in the face of waning immunity, then the virus is likely here to stay.</p>



<p>For example, <a href="https://science.sciencemag.org/content/368/6493/860">if immunity lasts around 40 weeks</a>, as it does for some cold-causing coronaviruses, then there may be yearly outbreaks of COVID-19, researchers reported in May in <em>Science</em>. If the immune system’s memory of the virus lasts slightly longer, say two years, then there may be biannual outbreaks. Permanent immunity could mean the virus may disappear entirely, though that possibility is unlikely since respiratory viruses like influenza and viruses that cause colds rarely lead to this sort of long-lasting immunity.</p>

</h4>
</aside>



<p>Adding an effective vaccine to the mix would help build — and maintain — immunity among people to control potential future outbreaks. And if a vaccine is highly effective and enough people take it plus any boosters or follow-up vaccinations as needed, that could help prevent the virus from spreading at all. But those are big ifs.</p>



<p>Because SARS-CoV-2 can be spread by people without symptoms, some experts do not anticipate the virus will go away any time soon, unlike the coronavirus that caused SARS. That virus stopped circulating among people a little more than a year after it appeared, in part because it wasn’t spread by people with no symptoms. That allowed public health experts to more easily isolate sick patients and quarantine their contacts to prevent the virus’ spread. It’s estimated that <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosmedicine/article?id=10.1371/journal.pmed.1003346">around 30 percent of people infected with SARS-CoV-2 don’t show symptoms</a>, making such total containment much harder.</p>



<p>“From everything we’re seeing so far,” says Barker, the Drew University immunologist, “this virus may become endemic and may be with us for a long time.” — <em>Erin Garcia de Jesus</em></p>

<hr class="docutils" />
<p>Localization of odors is essential to animal survival, and thus animals are
adept at odor navigation. In natural conditions animals encounter odor sources
in which odor is carried by air flow varying in complexity. We sought to
identify potential minimalist strategies that can effectively be used for
odor-based navigation and asses their performance in an increasingly chaotic
environment. To do so, we compared mouse, in silico model, and Arduino-based
robot odor-localization behavior in a standardized odor landscape. Mouse
performance remains robust in the presence of increased complexity, showing a
shift in strategy towards faster movement with increased environmental
complexity. Implementing simple binaral and temporal models of tropotaxis and
klinotaxis, an in silico model and Arduino robot, in the same environment as
the mice, are equally successful in locating the odor source within a plume of
low complexity. However, performance of these algorithms significantly drops
when the chaotic nature of the plume is increased. Additionally, both
algorithm-driven systems show more successful performance when using a strictly
binaral model at a larger sensor separation distance and more successful
performance when using a temporal and binaral model when using a smaller sensor
separation distance. This suggests that with an increasingly chaotic odor
environment, mice rely on complex strategies that allow for robust odor
localization that cannot be resolved by minimal algorithms that display robust
performance at low levels of complexity. Thus, highlighting that an animal's
ability to modulate behavior with environmental complexity is beneficial for
odor localization</p>

<p><em>By </em><a href="http://emilyoliviareynolds.com/">Emily Reynolds</a></p>



<p>No matter how much you love your partner, there are always going to be things about them that get on your nerves. These can be fairly superficial — not liking the way they fold the laundry, for example, or hating their favourite TV show. Other problems can be more serious — fundamental failures to communicate or disagreements on big decisions like having children. There’s also <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2019/09/02/new-romantic-relationships-may-end-up-following-the-same-patterns-as-previous-ones/https:/digest.bps.org.uk/2019/09/02/new-romantic-relationships-may-end-up-following-the-same-patterns-as-previous-ones/">evidence</a> that we continue to repeat these patterns in new relationships, even when we hope to see a change.</p>



<p>But while all couples argue, they don’t all do it in the same way. Techniques for managing conflict have been explored by François Bogacz and team from the University of Geneva in a new <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41599-020-00622-8#Sec1">study</a> published in <em>Humanities and Social Sciences Communication</em>. The study’s findings suggest that mediation — negotiation facilitated by a neutral third party such as a therapist or counsellor — may be the best way for couples to resolve serious conflict.</p>



<span id="more-40971"></span>



<p>Participants were heterosexual romantic couples who had been in a relationship for more than one year. About a month before the experiment started, participants filled in a number of measures. The “Dyadic Adjustment Scale” was used to measure the quality of relationships, with participants indicating how often they disagree with their partner on issues ranging from religious matters, sex, and life philosophy to housework and leisure time. The scale also covered how often participants thought about separating from their partner and how often there were significant disagreements.</p>



<p>The researchers also measured participants’ emotional competence (i.e. how well a person understands their own and others’ emotions) as well as dispositional mindfulness (i.e. how present someone is able to be in the moment). Finally, participants indicated how they respond before, during and after conflicts with people in their life. These answers revealed how much participants used four different styles of conflict: active-constructive (good at taking others’ perspectives), passive-constructive (delaying and considering a response to conflict), active-destructive (openly expressing anger) and passive-destructive (avoiding conflict altogether).</p>



<p>Immediately before the experiment, participants also rated their mood, and indicated how close they felt to their partner at that moment. Next, they were invited to select a topic for discussion from those most commonly reported as sources of disagreements.</p>



<p>Those in the control condition were then asked to discuss the controversial topic for an hour without any guidance and under the watch of a silent observer, while those in the mediation condition had their discussion facilitated by a neutral third party using a facilitative mediation model, in which partners reach a collective solution through exploring each other’s interests, feelings and outlooks.</p>



<p>After the experiment, participants rated the level of disagreement at the end of their discussion, their level of satisfaction with the discussion and their level of satisfaction with the <em>process</em> of the discussion, and indicated whether or not they had actually achieved a resolution on the topic at hand.</p>



<p>The team found that couples in the mediation condition were more likely to come to a resolution: 36 of the 38 participants in the mediation condition reported reaching an agreement compared to 26 of 38 in the control condition. Participants who had gone through the mediation process also felt closer to their partners after the discussion, while there was no change in closeness for those in the control condition.</p>



<p>How participants reported dealing with conflict also related to other aspects of their personality and their feelings about their relationships. Active-constructive and passive-constructive profiles were positively associated with mindfulness, while those who were passive-destructive were less likely to be mindful and present in the moment. Participants who rated themselves as more emotionally competent also tended to report being more satisfied in their relationship. </p>



<p>Whether couples would have responded in the same way in a naturalistic setting is unclear. The presence of a silent observer may have affected how participants in the control condition dealt with the conflict — screaming at your partner about their very worst qualities is likely to be pretty uncomfortable and inhibited in front of somebody else in a way it may not be at home.</p>



<p>Further research could focus on <em>why</em> mediation works, as well as looking at different types of facilitative relationship. There are also interesting avenues to explore around the <em>content </em>of conflicts. While on the surface an argument may appear to be about who does the dishes more, it’s likely that there are other factors at play, the washing up merely a stand-in for deeper issues about compatibility, personality or politics.</p>



<p>What is clear from the study is that certain personality traits or skills can help resolve conflict. These aren’t impossible things to master — emotional competence is a focus in many types of individual therapeutic intervention. But for those who <em>don’t </em>happen to have those traits or struggle to foster them, mediation seems like a hopeful option.</p>

<p><strong>Author: Iain Hrynaszkiewicz, Publisher, Open Research</strong></p>



<p>To support increased sharing of open research methodologies — and in an exciting extension to our partnership with <strong>protocols.io</strong> — we are announcing two new peer-reviewed article types in <em>PLOS ONE</em> in 2021: <strong>Lab Protocols </strong>and <strong>Study Protocols</strong>. </p>



<p>Please <a href="https://plos.org/protocols/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">sign-up</a> to receive updates on launch.</p>



<p>These new article types are intended to address three issues familiar to researchers: the rigor and reproducibility of research, efficiency in getting feedback, and recognition for developing and sharing diverse research contributions.</p>



<p><strong><strong>Lab Protocols</strong> </strong>have been developed in close collaboration with researchers and the protocols.io team. They describe <em>verified</em>, reusable methodologies including computational techniques, and consist of two interlinked components:</p>



<ol><li>A step-by-step protocol posted to protocols.io, utilizing specialized tools for communicating methodological details, including reagents, measurements, formulae, video clips and dynamic flow charts–an array of features that facilitate the direct use of the protocol at the bench. </li><li>A peer-reviewed <em>PLOS ONE</em> article contextualizing the protocol, with sections discussing applications, limitations, expected results and sample datasets from using the protocol.</li></ol>



<p>We are also introducing <strong>Study Protocols</strong>,<strong> </strong>an established article type that allows researchers to share detailed plans and proposals for funded research projects that have not yet generated results. </p>



<p>Both <strong>Lab Protocols</strong> and <strong>Study Protocols</strong> will be open to research in all fields of study within <em>PLOS ONE</em>’s inclusive scope.</p>



<h3><strong>Why protocols, why now?</strong></h3>



<p>Many researchers share <strong>Lab Protocols </strong>informally with peers and, in our work to better understand researcher needs, we learned that a motivation for sharing protocols is to seek feedback to improve them. The importance of methods development and sharing also deserves increased recognition, via a peer-reviewed publication. Understanding the exquisite details that make methods work is also essential for reproducibility and for accelerating science. Researchers who develop methods, especially those early in their careers, deserve more recognition than a footnote in a research article.</p>



<p><strong><strong>Study Protocols</strong> </strong>are important for improving rigor and transparency by sharing a study’s design, recruitment and analysis plans before research has been carried out. This practice is especially important — and already common — in healthcare research, including systematic reviews. Study Protocols complement our offering of Registered Reports. Researchers are not required to submit the results of their Study Protocol  to the same journal, which  provides more researchers with Open Access options to share their peer-reviewed research plans.</p>



<p>These article types in <em>PLOS ONE</em> offer new ways to share research according to the principles of open science, bolstering transparency, reproducibility, and accelerating research. We also hope that they provide opportunities for researchers who have experienced lab closures in 2020 to remain engaged with their research, and explore more ways to demonstrate their productivity and contributions.</p>



<h3><strong>Beginning a roadmap for improved methods papers</strong></h3>



<p>After iterative development with researchers of a new format for <strong>Lab Protocols</strong>, which includes prominent reciprocal linking between platforms, we will be launching the article type as a pilot in 2021. By partnering with a specialist platform in protocols.io we can offer authors enhanced functionality for sharing and displaying their protocols in actionable ways alongside the features of a peer-reviewed publication. Researchers will also benefit from dynamic functionality of protocols.io, for modifying and sharing new versions of protocols in the future.</p>



<p>As another unique feature, authors of <strong>Lab Protocols</strong> at <em>PLOS ONE</em> who are new users of the protocols.io platform can receive free support from the protocols.io editorial team to <a href="https://www.protocols.io/we-enter-protocols">upload and format their protocols</a> as part of the publication process in <em>PLOS ONE</em>.</p>



<p>During 2021 we will gather more feedback to inform potential future directions for the article format and author workflow. The launch of the pilot is the first phase of exploring continuous improvement of the experience of publishing and reading protocols.</p>



<p>PLOS and protocols.io are committed to developing our services and future plans based on community feedback. And we want to hear the full spectrum of feedback from different communities around the globe. If you have questions, feedback, or ideas please reach out to Iain Hrynaszkiewicz (ihrynaszkiewicz@plos.org) or Emma Ganley (emma@protocols.io), or leave a comment below.</p>

<img alt="" class="attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image" height="86" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2020/12/logo-rev2-140x86.png" style="display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;" width="140" /><p>Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is defined as the presence of lasting functional abnormalities in the renal structure and function that can worsen over time. Kidneys are vital for the whole body to work properly. Therefore, when a person has CKD, they may also have problems with the functioning of the rest of their body.  Some of the common complications of CKD include anemia, bone disease, heart disease, high potassium, high calcium and fluid accumulation.</p>
<p>CKD is an important public health problem worldwide, especially in older people, and it is associated with a huge economic burden. High income countries generally spend more than 2-3% of their annual budget on the treatment of end-stage renal disease, although people receiving such treatments represent less than 0.03% of the total population. <a href="https://www.kidney-international.org/article/S0085-2538(15)55004-7/fulltext">https://www.kidney-international.org/article/S0085-2538(15)55004-7/fulltext</a></p>
<p>Although the prevalence of CKD is increasing and the importance of early diagnosis to prevent complications such as end-stage renal disease (ESRD) is well established, screening programmes in Europe are highly heterogeneous and fragmented. Health system planning requires careful evaluation of the epidemiology of CKD, but data on morbidity and mortality of this disease are scarce or non-existent in many countries. <a href="https://www.thelancet.com/article/S0140-6736(20)30045-3/fulltext">https://www.thelancet.com/article/S0140-6736(20)30045-3/fulltext</a></p>
<p>The SCOPE (Screening for CKD among older people across Europe) H2020 project implemented in  seven European Countries plus Israel includes an observational prospective study with a 2-year follow up, recruiting 2426 older people aged 75+, to investigate whether and to which extent currently available screening methods may identify older people at risk of worsening kidney function.</p>
<p>Preliminary results from the baseline database of the SCOPE Project was made available in the <a href="https://bmcgeriatr.biomedcentral.com/articles/supplements/volume-20-supplement-1">BMC Geriatrics Special Issue</a> by Dr Fabrizia Lattanzio et al.</p>
<p><strong>CKD and Quality of Life</strong></p>
<p>Quality of life (QoL) refers to the physical, psychological, social, and medical aspects of life that are influenced by health status and functions. The SCOPE team investigated the QoL among older in early stage of CKD, to identify the factors that influence this relationship. <a href="https://bmcgeriatr.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12877-020-01697-3">The study</a> results showed that CKD and its severity may be significantly associated with impaired QoL among community-dwelling older people.</p>
<p><strong>Is kidney function associated with cognition and mood in late life?</strong></p>
<p>The prevalence of CKD and cognitive impairment is growing as a result of the aging population. CKD, cognitive impairment, and mood disorder share common risk factors. Whether a decreased kidney function is associated with cognitive and mood disorders in the oldest old is not completely clear. Therefore, the SCOPE team has investigated for the first time the possible association between kidney function, cognition and mood. <a href="https://bmcgeriatr.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12877-020-01707-4">The study</a> results showed that the prevalence of cognitive impairment and depressive symptoms  does not increase among older people in more advanced stages of CKD.</p>
<p><strong>Is CKD a predictor of falls?</strong></p>
<p>Falls are a serious negative health outcome in older persons. In facts, the fall rate rises with increasing age. However, the impact of CKD on falls in older community-dwelling persons is not well investigated yet, especially in relation to the urinary tract symptoms (LUTS). The SCOPE team studied the impact of CKD and LUTS on falls as well as on injurious falls. <a href="https://bmcgeriatr.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12877-020-01698-2">The study</a> results showed that lower urinary tract symptoms are a predictor of falls and injurious falls, while the association between CKD and falls needs to be prospectively investigated.</p>
<p><strong>CKD and sarcopenia</strong></p>
<p>Loss of muscle mass and function (sarcopenia) may be more pronounced in older adults with CKD, wherein the protein albumin is abnormally present in the urine (albuminuria). The SCOPE team investigated the prevalence of sarcopenia among community-dwelling older adults according to kidney function and albuminuria levels. <a href="https://bmcgeriatr.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12877-020-01700-x">The study</a> results showed that sarcopenia is common among older adults, especially those in more advanced CKD stages, even if the estimated prevalence slightly differs depending on the equation used to assess estimated Glomerular Filtration Rate (eGFR); likewise, sarcopenia seems to be widespread among older people with higher albuminuria levels.</p>
<p><strong>Association between kidney function and nutritional status</strong></p>
<p>Different mechanisms connect the nutritional status with the occurrence and the course of CKD. Existing literature shows that especially during end-stage renal disease, there are complications that lead to malnutrition (undernutrition). However, the SCOPE team has further investigated this relationship between kidney function and nutritional status. <a href="https://bmcgeriatr.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12877-020-01699-1">The study</a> results showed that population of community-dwelling 75+ with CKD show general features of overweight and obesity with a small prevalence of malnutrition.</p>
<p><strong>CKD in multimorbidity patterns</strong></p>
<p>CKD is known to be associated with several co-occurring conditions. The SCOPE team has explored multimorbidity patterns, as well as the impact of physical performance and CKD severity among an older community-dwelling people. <a href="https://bmcgeriatr.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12877-020-01696-4">The study</a> results showed that CKD contributes significantly to multimorbidity patterns in a population of older outpatients and it was rarely observed without any co-occurring diseases. Moreover, CKD may cluster with hypertension and sensory impairments, but its contribution to multimorbidity pattern may be affected by CKD severity.</p>
<p>These scientific results prompt to further improve the screening methods for CKD in the older population and the models of assistance and care through longitudinal studies. The early diagnosis of CKD represents a priority issue to be addressed to prevent / slow its progression among older patients and, at the same time, to reduce the need for long-term care and the related cost for the healthcare system.</p>

<p><em>By</em> <a href="https://emmayoung.net/">Emma Young</a></p>



<p>What happens to a narcissistic woman when she becomes a mother? Can someone with an unmet desire for attention, love and recognition — which characterises all narcissists — adapt well to having a baby to care for? The answer, according to a <a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2020-74084-001">new study </a>in <em>Personality Disorders: Theory, Research and Treatment,</em> is that it really depends what type of narcissist the mother is. And even, then, the conclusions were based on self-reports, which should probably be received with caution.</p>



<span id="more-40960"></span>



<p>Narcissism is generally thought to come in two types. Grandiose narcissists crave admiration, lack empathy, feel more envy than is typical, and have an inflated sense of their own self-worth and entitlement. Vulnerable narcissists share some of these traits, but, in contrast, they are fundamentally insecure, often expressing a sense of inadequacy, and more negative emotions, including shame and hostility to others.</p>



<p>Anat Talmon at Stanford University and colleagues studied 385 Israeli woman, recruited via general online forums dedicated to pregnancy and the transition to motherhood. The participants completed a battery of tests while they were pregnant, and also two months after giving birth. These tests assessed both types of narcissism, along with participants’ general psychological wellbeing, how they felt about their bodies, their own evaluations of their adequacy as a mother (and their predictions of this, before the birth), perceived attachment and bonding with their babies, and also their levels of positive and negative emotion.</p>



<p>The team found that the women who ranked relatively high on the grandiose narcissism scale also reported high levels of wellbeing in the transition to motherhood. Vulnerable narcissism, however, was associated with higher levels of distress.</p>



<p>It’s possible that grandiose women are more inclined to view their baby as an extension of themselves, the researchers write — so feel more positively about it. This idea is perhaps supported by their finding that this group reported stronger attachment to their babies, and that it was this sense of attachment that seemed to lead to greater wellbeing among these women. The team also found that grandiose women tended to have a relatively poorer body experience during pregnancy, however (perhaps because of fatigue or weight gain, for example) but more positive attitudes to their body after giving birth. This particular effect “may be attributed to the grandiose experience of bringing a child into the world,” the researchers observe.</p>



<p>The results showed that women with vulnerable narcissism clearly fared less well, however. They reported relatively more negative feelings about their own bodies, more distress, lower anticipated and actual efficacy as a mother, and greater difficulty bonding with their newborn.</p>



<p>“To the best of our knowledge, our findings provide the first evidence of how the two components of narcissism respond differently to the adjustment to motherhood,” the team writes.</p>



<p>There are, though, some limitations to their study. Most notably, all of the data came from the women’s own self-reports. This raises various questions, such as: did the grandiose mothers really form stronger attachments to their babies — or did they just like to think that they did? Indeed, other studies have found that <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/280102005_THE_RELATIONSHIP_BETWEEN_PARENTAL_NARCISSISM_AND_CHILDREN'S_MENTAL_VULNERABILITY_THE_MEDIATION_ROLE_OF_THE_REARING_STYLE">narcissistic parents show lower levels of care for their children</a> (who are then at higher risk of developing anxiety and depression) and are <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10896-015-9672-3">more likely to physically abuse their children</a>. As the authors themselves write, “The idea that a grandiose individual might tend to be somewhat disconnected from her actual mental state could shed light on the report of increased levels of wellbeing during this challenging transitional period.”</p>



<p>Still, the work certainly does contribute to research on how a woman’s personality contributes to her feelings about herself, and her baby, during and just after pregnancy. The “unique contribution made by each type of narcissism highlights the nuanced way in which we should observe individuals,” the team notes.</p>

[This is the abstract for just one of seven presentations.]

Abstract:  Over the last decade, the digital humanities community has become increasingly concerned with the ongoing sustainability of digital projects. This anxiety stems in part from the realization that not all digital humanities projects have identical expectations of longevity. Several prominent works in the literature, such as Bethany Nowviskie and Dot Porter’s “Graceful Degradation Survey Findings: How Do We Manage Digital Humanities Projects through Times of Transition and Decline?” (2010) and Geoffrey Rockwell et al.’s “Burying Dead Projects: Depositing the Globalization Compendium” (2014), have been central to this intellectual exchange about the benefits of creating sustainability plans for projects that do not necessarily assume a default permanence, but that instead proactively consider each project’s most suitable longevity strategy.

 

With this realization has come a concomitant expectation: each digital humanities project must create its own customized sustainability plan, designed with its particular requirements in mind. And yet, few digital humanists have access to direct training on the process of creating and implementing professional-grade digital preservation and sustainability practices for their own work. To support the process of designing and implementing digital sustainability plans for this work, a team of scholars housed in the Visual Media Workshop at the University of Pittsburgh has created the Socio-Technical Sustainability Roadmap (STSR; http://sustainingdh.net). The STSR is a structured, process-oriented workshop, inspired by design thinking and collaborative learning approaches. This workshop, which may be implemented in a variety of institutional contexts, guides project stakeholders through the practice of creating effective, iterative, ongoing digital sustainability strategies that address the needs of both social and technological infrastructures. It is founded on the fundamental assumption that, for sustainability practices to be successful, project leaders must keep the changing, socially-contingent nature of both their project and their working environment(s) consistently in mind as they initiate, maintain, and support their own work. For this panel, we contextualize and describe the STSR, and provide reflections based on our experiences facilitating Sustaining DH: An NEH Institute for Advanced Topics in the Digital Humanities.

It does also include a lot of factual data, as well as links and footnotes for those who like them. </span></p><p><span>Importantly, while I do not consider myself to be an OA advocate, I admit that I was as naïve as anyone else about what the movement might be able to achieve.</span></p><p><span>Finally, while what I say might be slightly overweight in European developments, it may not matter if (as I believe is possible) events in Europe end up determining how open access develops globally. </span></p><p><span>I say this because it seems possible that European OA initiatives will reconfigure the international scholarly communication system, and in ways that OA advocates will not be comfortable with. </span></p><p><span>I would add that the main focus is on science publishing rather than HSS. </span></p><p><span>To download my new eBook please click <b><a href="https://richardpoynder.co.uk/Information_Wants_to_be_Free.pdf">this link</a></b>.

<img alt="friendly doctor talking to patient . CT Scan in hospital" class="attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image" height="110" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2020/12/CT-Scan-140x110.jpg" style="display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;" width="140" /><p>In the era of protocol-driven care, straightforward guidelines are often desired but can result in oversimplification of the decision. That has been the case for use of iin individuals with kidney disease. Instead of weighing the risk of contrast administration on a case-by-case basis, there seems to be a default to a recommendation against the use of contrast. This has resulted in patients with kidney disease not getting the necessary studies leading to delays in diagnosis and treatment.</p>
<blockquote><p>Recognizing contrast nephropathy and those characteristics that contribute to risk are important to an informed decision on the use of contrast.</p></blockquote>
<p>Recognizing contrast nephropathy and those characteristics that contribute to risk are important to an informed decision on the use of contrast. The variable definitions for diagnosis and the previous use of high osmolar agents resulted in a <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1053/j.ackd.2017.03.003">high incidence of acute kidney injury</a>. Keep in mind, this diagnosis was often based on the labs and clinical scenario without confirmatory kidney biopsy findings. Biopsies may show features of acute tubular necrosis, but there is no distinguishing feature to implicate iodinated contrast exposure.</p>
<p>Review of larger administrative databases cannot reproduce the higher rates of acute kidney injury. In a larger series, using propensity scores comparing 116,694 who received contrast for CT scans with 40,446 who did not receive contrast. There was <a href="https://doi.org/10.1148/radiol.2015154044">no increase in absolute risk of kidney injury</a>. Another review of an administrative inpatient database of 5.9 million individuals with comorbidities by <a href="https://doi.org/10.1681/ASN.2016010021">Wilheml-Leen <em>et al.</em></a> demonstrated the risk of acute kidney injury was nearly the same regardless of the use of IV contrast.</p>
<p>The use of iso-osmolar/low molecular weight agents has resulted in lower rates of contrast-induced kidney injury. Identification of factors such as underlying CKD stage 4 or 5, use of higher osmolar agents, intra-arterial administration of the contrast, concomitant hemodynamic instability, use of a large volume of contrast, and pre-existing volume depletion would help practitioners better predict the risk of contrast use. The risk for an individual with a GFR of 50 mL/min/1.73m<sup>2</sup> receiving iodinated contrast for a CT scan of the chest to evaluate a pulmonary nodule is not the same as the individual with a GFR of 50 mL/min/1.73m<sup>2</sup> who presents with acute myocardial infarction and hemodynamic instability needing an emergent cardiac catheterization.</p>
<p>Our recommendations for contrast use in these two cases should not be the same. Contrast-induced nephrotoxic injury can occur but the risk is not the same for all situations. Our approach should be a more thoughtful review of the individual clinical situation and an assessment of whether the benefit of the information gained from the study outweighs the risk. Additionally, there should be a dialogue with patients about the decision-making process rather than simplified guidelines.</p>

<p><em>By </em><a href="http://emilyoliviareynolds.com/">Emily Reynolds</a></p>



<p>A huge variety of factors are related to memory, from mood to personality to what <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2018/07/30/amsterdam-coffee-shop-study-explores-the-effects-of-cannabis-on-eye-witness-memory/">substances have been consumed</a>. One recent study, for example, found that <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2020/05/20/memory-complaints-are-more-common-among-older-adults-with-particular-personality-traits/">older adults with higher openness to experience also experienced fewer cognitive complaints</a> each day; other work has found a <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6629149/">relationship between self-reported memory and traits</a> including neuroticism and extraversion.</p>



<p>Now, in a <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0956797620953883">study published in <em>Psychological Science</em></a>, Emily F. Hittner from Northwestern University and team have looked at the relationship between memory and positive affect — the experience of pleasant emotional states like enthusiasm, pride or joy. And they found less memory decline over time in those participants with higher levels of positive affect.</p>



<span id="more-40944"></span>



<p>The team analysed data from 991 participants who had taken part in a longitudinal study of households in the United States. At the first time point, when participants were an average of 55 years old, they had reported  their levels of positive affect using two scales, which asked how often during the last month they had felt enthusiastic, active, peaceful, satisfied and so on. They also completed measures of depression and negative affect, as well as personality trait scales.</p>



<p>Participants also took part in a memory assessment. In this test, they were read a list of 15 unrelated words and then had to recall as many as they could immediately (immediate recall) and, in a test they were not warned about, after fifteen minutes (delayed recall). Then, nine years later, participants completed this memory test again.</p>



<p>The team found that, overall, people who reported more positive affect at the first time point showed less memory decline over these nine years. Particular facets of positive affect were also associated with less memory decline — greater enthusiasm, cheerfulness, pride, and feelings of calm and peace were all related to slower memory decline, while greater attentiveness or satisfaction were not. Importantly, all the analyses took into account other factors like participants’ <em>negative</em> affect, personality traits and age, suggesting that these weren’t responsible for the results.</p>



<p>Why positive affect is related to a slower rate of memory decline, however, was less clear. The team suggests a number of pathways that could link the two: if you have a positive outlook on life, for example, you might be more inclined to engage in adaptive health behaviours or to foster beneficial social relationships. Positive affect in and of itself may not be the crucial factor, in other words, instead acting as the source of behaviours that improve or protect health.</p>



<p>Memory loss can be devastating, particularly in older adults — forgetting to take vital medication, for example, has serious consequences, and the emotional and social ramifications of forgetting the names or faces of acquaintances can also be severe. Memory decline can also predict the onset of dementia. Developing ways to predict (and prevent) memory loss is an important task. Screening for positive affect as a way of predicting potential memory decline, as the team suggests, could therefore have implications for cognitive as well as mental health, helping improve wellbeing across the board.</p>

<p>This week on Journal Club session Emil Dmitruk will talk about a paper "Cliques and cavities in human connectome".</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>Encoding brain regions and their connections as a network of nodes and edges
captures many of the possible paths along which information can be transmitted
as humans order relations, concepts naturally expressed in the language of
algebraic topology. These tools can be used to study mesoscale network
structures that arise from the arrangement of densely connected substructures
called cliques in otherwise sparsely connected brain networks. We detect cliques
(all-to-all connected sets of brain regions) in the average structural
connectomes of 8 healthy adults scanned in triplicate and discover the presence
of more large cliques than expected in null networks constructed via wiring
minimization, providing architecture through which brain network can perform
rapid, local processing. We then locate topological cavities of different
dimensions, around which information may flow in either diverging or converging
patterns. These cavities exist consistently across subjects, differ from those
observed in null model networks, and - importantly - link regions of early and
late evolutionary origin in long loops, underscoring their unique role in
controlling brain function. These results offer a first demonstration that
techniques from algebraic topology offer a novel perspective on structural
connectomics, highlighting loop-like paths as crucial features in the human
brain’s structural architecture.</p>

<p><em>By</em> <a href="https://emmayoung.net/">Emma Young</a></p>



<p>Covid-19 has changed our working lives, perhaps for good. Home-working is now common, and many of us have been doing it for months. With changing rules and guidelines, some of us have even gone from home-working to socially distanced office-working, to working back at home again. So what do we know about how these changes are affecting our mental health — and what can we do to make our new working lives better?</p>



<span id="more-40935"></span>



<p><strong>How are we feeling?</strong></p>



<p>In January 2019 (pre-Covid-19), 35% of <a href="https://www.cipd.co.uk/knowledge/work/trends/goodwork/covid-impact">UK employees surveyed for the CIPD</a> (a professional human resources body) reported that work had a positive impact on their mental health, while 27% said that work had a negative impact. By summer 2020, those figures had shifted to 34% and 26% respectively. On these measures, at least, Covid-19 had no obvious impact. </p>



<p>In this second survey, employees did report high levels of anxiety about contracting the virus at work — but despite this, half of those who were working remotely were looking forward to returning to their workplace. Almost half of all of the people surveyed also reported that social connections at work had worsened. Clearly, although the impact of work itself on our mental health hadn’t changed, altered work circumstances were — and are — causing difficulties, which are being further explored…</p>



<p><strong>How bad is home-working?</strong></p>



<p>“It can be argued that the crisis has led to the most significant, intensive social experiment of digital, home-based working that has ever occurred.”</p>



<p>This statement is from the website of the ongoing <a href="https://www.workingathome.org.uk/project-overview/">Working@home project</a>, led by Abigail Marks at Stirling University, which seeks to understand the impact of this “experiment”. As the team points out, some commentators have suggested that home-based work is emancipatory, and improves work flexibility. However, the team also notes, “this new world order, where the home becomes a multi-occupational, multi-person workplace… not only challenges boundaries but also conceptions of the domestic space.” So how is it making us feel?</p>



<p>Overall, not great, according to their initial survey of home workers. One in three reported sharing their home working space, 37% reported that home conflicts have increased, and almost one in four said that they were doing poorly or very poorly in terms of general health. The most commonly cited trigger for household conflict was “interrupting or being noisy while you work”.</p>



<p><strong>Keys to coping at home</strong></p>



<p>Yanmengqian Zhou at Penn State University and colleagues studied symptoms of depression and anxiety as well as coping strategies among American adults during the first few months of the pandemic. <a href="https://www.mdpi.com/1660-4601/17/17/6315">Their study</a>, published in the <em>International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health</em>, revealed that levels of “social strain” — someone else making demands, giving criticism or just getting on your nerves — was the most consistent predictor of these symptoms of poor mental health. Anyone who’s working at home with their partner is certainly more likely to experience this kind of strain, especially if you have to share the same room. </p>



<p>But the team did also identify helpful strategies for working in the time of Covid-19. They recommend keeping a consistent schedule, reminding yourself that things will get better, finding activities to distract yourself and taking care of others who need help. None of these strategies will stop you irritating each other, but they might at least ease the strain a little.</p>



<p>Based on their own research, Kristen Shockley and Malissa Clark at the University of Georgia also <a href="https://www.siop.org/Research-Publications/Items-of-Interest/ArtMID/19366/ArticleID/3454/Work-Family-Balance-Struggles-in-the-Time-of-COVID-19">recommend some kind of work-life/home-life boundary activity </a>to replace the lost commute. Just a walk near your home at the start and end of the work day can make it easier to switch between roles, they say.</p>



<p><strong>Overcoming “presence privilege”</strong></p>



<p>In <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7266131/">a recent issue of Occupational Health Science</a>, ten experts were invited to comment on work-related issues associated with Covid-19. Larissa K. Barber at San Diego State University argues that as remote working is now common, it’s time to get rid of the “physical presence privilege”.</p>



<p>Traditionally, Barber writes, “in-person meetings are preferred over web-conferencing, driving in over logging in”. Being physically present in the workplace is also conflated with work attention and productivity, she adds. Now that remote working is common, Barber thinks it’s high time that organisations shift their thinking and also devote energy and resources to making this style of working better for employees.</p>



<p>One way to do this is to respect technological boundaries in the same way that we traditionally respect physical boundaries. “Barging into a coworker’s office, family dinner or even bedroom for an immediate work response is antisocial. Yet we tolerate and encourage similar behaviours in electronic communications,” Barber notes (something that anyone who’s ever had a demanding email from their boss outside work hours will appreciate). Clearly, this is not a new problem — but perhaps with a mass shift to remote working, organisations will now feel obliged to set clear technological ground rules, for the benefit of us all.</p>



<p><strong>Regaining control</strong></p>



<p>The pandemic, and the lockdowns associated with it, have profoundly challenged our autonomy — our sense of being in control of our actions and also seeing an alignment between our behaviour and our personal values and goals (an aspect of autonomy often called “authenticity”). Autonomy is widely considered to be important for wellbeing. Unsurprisingly, then, there have been a number of studies exploring how Covid-19 has affected it, and how we’ve felt as a result.</p>



<p>One recent paper, published in the <em>Journal of Applied Psychology</em>, found that while there were spikes in feelings of powerlessness and inauthenticity in the early days of the pandemic, <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2020/09/10/the-process-of-psychological-recovery-begins-while-a-stressful-event-is-still-going-on-according-to-study-of-early-stages-of-coronavirus-pandemic/">these increases actually started to subside quite rapidly</a>. The team concludes that because a sense of autonomy is so important to us, the participants were making changes in their lives to restore it, even in the face of ongoing stress and restrictions. All kinds of strategies, such as deciding to spend what used to be work commute time on a hobby or exercise, or even just revelling in the sudden ability to wear whatever they wanted for work (below the belt, at least, during Zoom meetings) could have helped.</p>



<p>Other researchers, including Adam Butler at the University of Iowa, in that recent special issue of Occupational Health Science, point to studies finding that higher perceptions of control are associated with reduced stress among nurses. All of this suggests that whatever employers can do to enhance employee autonomy at “work”  — and home working brings its own challenges, of course — should be good for their mental health.</p>

Two of the articles discuss the relatively established pursuits of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuroesthetics" target="_blank">neuroaesthetics</a> (<a href="https://www.cell.com/neuron/fulltext/S0896-6273(20)30818-7" target="_blank">Iigaya et al., 2020</a>) and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuromorality" target="_blank">neuromorality</a>/moral decision-making (<a href="https://www.cell.com/neuron/fulltext/S0896-6273(20)30820-5" target="_blank">Kelly &amp; O'Connell, 2020</a>). </p><p></p><p>Another article outlines the bare bones of an ambitious search for the neural correlates of collective memory, or the “Cultural Engram” (<a href="https://www.cell.com/neuron/fulltext/S0896-6273(20)30816-3" target="_blank">Dudai, 2020</a>):<br /></p><p></p><blockquote>I consider human cultures as biocultural ‘‘supraorganisms’’ that can store memory as distributed experience-dependent, behaviorally relevant representations over hundreds and thousands of years. Similar to other memory systems, these supraorganisms encode, consolidate, store, modify, and express memory items in the concerted activity of multiple types and tokens of sub-components of the system.  . . .  ...the memory traces are encoded in large distributed assemblies, composed of individual brains, intragenerational and intergenerational interacting brains, and multiple types of artifacts that interact with brains.</blockquote><p></p><p><br /></p><p>The concept of the “Cultural Engram” is <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=Vj4iUOi2lHgC&amp;pg=PA34&amp;lpg=PA34&amp;dq=%22cultural+engram%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=ENSeCJafjS&amp;sig=ACfU3U2r91u7aeTeQa3SLcNk4Z7mGzjz-w&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjP1v6ci6ztAhXHpJ4KHaymACMQ6AEwC3oECBQQAg#v=onepage&amp;q=%22cultural%20engram%22&amp;f=false" target="_blank">not</a> <a href="https://issuu.com/vladimirmuhvich/docs/pro_engrama_p_trad_2017_english" target="_blank">new</a>, but a research program that incorporates an animal model for cultural memory is indeed novel (regardless of its potential validity): <br /></p><p></p><blockquote>The search for the cultural engram ... must be paired with productive model systems. The human cultural engram is awaiting its supraorganism equivalents of Aplysia, Drosophila, or fear conditioning for it to give away its inner workings.</blockquote><p></p><p>In other words, a model of human cultural memory in sea slugs and fruit flies.</p><p><br /></p><p><a href="https://www.cell.com/neuron/fulltext/S0896-6273(20)30817-5" target="_blank">Hartley and Poepell (2020)</a> discuss “A Neurohumanities Approach to Language, Music, and Emotion’’ <span class="ILfuVd"><span class="hgKElc">—</span></span> which is intriguing to me, since the domains of language, music, and emotion have a long history within the pantheon of human cognitive neuroscience research.

<p><em>Chapter 7 of </em><em><a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://global.oup.com/academic/product/family-guide-to-mental-illness-and-the-law-9780190622220?cc=us&amp;lang=en&amp;">Family Guide to Mental Illness and the Law</a></em><em> is titled “When Police Are Called to Help” and deals with two types of circumstances: those involving people with mental illness as victims of crime and those in which families seek help from police during a mental health crisis. This blog post contains one small excerpt from that chapter.</em><em> </em></p><p>When you call 911 for assistance with someone whose mental health symptoms are out of control:</p><h2>1. Ask for the Crisis Intervention Team</h2><p>Specifically ask for Crisis Intervention Team (CIT) officers with mental health training. Tell the dispatcher that the person you are calling about has a diagnosed mental illness and is experiencing a mental health crisis and explain what that illness is.</p><h2>2. Help prepare the police officers for the scene</h2><p>Then after setting that foundation help prepare the officers for the scene by giving the 911 operator all of the details about the current behavior.</p><ul><li>Does this person have a weapon?</li><li>Is the person athletic or trained in martial arts?</li><li>Give facts about their size.</li><li> At this moment, is the person delusional, depressed, hallucinating, manic, spastic, or agitated?</li><li>Provide very quick context for any statements that the person is making.</li></ul><h2>3. Flag down the police officers upon arrival</h2><p>To help make the police encounter as safe as possible for everyone present, you or someone else should go outside to flag down the police and tell them where the building entrances are and where the event is happening inside the building.</p><h2>4. Give the on-scene police officers an update</h2><p>Even though you told everything to the dispatcher, give a quick descriptive update to the on-scene police as soon as you can. For example:</p><ul><li>“My bipolar thirty-year-old son, Steve, threw me down the stairs. I don’t know if he took his medicine. He is shaking all over and won’t talk to any of us.”</li><li>“My twenty-five-year-old sister, Kay, is delusional. She is pulling everything off of the shelves and throwing it on the floor. I ran next door. Nobody else is in the house with her.”</li><li>“My husband, Ted, is depressed. He locked himself in the upstairs bathroom and is crying about an old business failure. He keeps saying angry things about Bob, but Bob is long gone. There is no reason to worry about Bob.”</li></ul><h2>5. Stay out of the way</h2><p>Once the officers begin to work the scene, stay out of the way! Do not talk unless an officer asks you a question or calls on you to say something but stay close enough that the officers can communicate with you if they need to. The CIT officers know how to interact with people suffering from specific mental disturbances; they do not need you to translate for them. All police officers are trained to stabilize situations, so even if there is not a CIT officer present you should not interfere once you’ve oriented the officers to the situation.</p><p> </p><p><em>Featured image by <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://unsplash.com/photos/ZXqE31D8TEk">Davey Heuser</a></em></p><p>The post <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://blog.oup.com/2020/11/how-to-call-for-the-police-crisis-intervention-team/">How to call for the police Crisis Intervention Team</a> appeared first on <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://blog.oup.com">OUPblog</a>.</p><img align="left" border="0" height="1" hspace="0" src="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/i/639355027/0/oupblogpsychology" style="border: 0; float: left; margin: 0; padding: 0; width: 1px!important; height: 1px!important;" width="1" /><div style="clear: both; padding-top: 0.2em;"><a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/2/639355027/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/fbshare20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/28/639355027/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/fblike20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/30/639355027/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/googleplus20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/16/639355027/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/linkedin20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/29/639355027/oupblogpsychology,"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/pinterest20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/1/639355027/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/reddit20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/24/639355027/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/twitter20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/19/639355027/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/email20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/20/639355027/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/rss20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a><h3 style="clear: left; padding-top: 10px;">Related Stories</h3><ul><li><a href="https://blog.oup.com/2020/11/the-jeremiah-barker-papers-medicine-as-practiced-200-years-ago/" rel="nofollow">The Jeremiah Barker Papers: medicine as practiced 200 years ago</a></li><li><a href="https://blog.oup.com/2020/11/the-case-for-investing-in-wind-energy/" rel="nofollow">The case for investing in wind energy</a></li><li><a href="https://blog.oup.com/2020/11/a-conversation-on-music-and-autism-part-two/" rel="nofollow">A conversation on music and autism (part two)</a></li></ul> </div>

<p>While puberty is not the easiest time of most people’s lives, the onset of early puberty is a notable public health issue which can lead to a higher risk of developing mental, emotional, and physical health conditions, such as depression, eating disorders, substance use, risky sexual activities, early sexual debut, and underage pregnancy.</p>
<p>A study by Aghaee <em>et al.</em> explored the impact of household intactness (defined as the child living with both parents until at least the age of 6, with this being checked during approximately a dozen healthcare visits between the ages of 0 and 6) on pubertal trajectories, focusing on filling the knowledge gap with regards to racial/ethnic minorities, as the majority of previous studies have been conducted using predominantly White cohorts. Their study included 26,044 girls born at a Kaiser Permanente Northern California medical facility between 2003 and 2010.</p>
<p>This study found that early life exposure to household non-intactness was associated with early pubertal timing in the girls included in this study, and that this association may vary between race/ethnicity, strongest among Black girls. While it goes without saying that the conditions of the family home cannot be modified by healthcare professionals, this knowledge can help facilitate conversations with the caregivers of young girls, who can work with providers to pinpoint areas of home life that can be improved through social and family services, hopefully avoiding the risk of early puberty.</p>

<p>In the US, immigrants who lack citizenship face significant barriers to accessing health care. From undocumented immigrants who are less likely to have medical insurance, to those with temporary status who are ineligible for federally-funded public insurance, and even lawful permanent residents (such as green card holders), immigrants face barriers compared to individuals with citizenship.</p>
<p>In recent years, state policy makers have increasingly enacted restrictive immigrant policies, referred to as criminalization policies based on their punitive treatment of noncitizens though surveillance and policing, linking immigration to the criminal justice system.</p>
<p>A study by Young <em>et al.</em> noted that these criminalization policies reinforced the marginalization of non-citizens, also producing health inequity between the states in the US. Advancing policies that de-criminalize or buffer immigrants from federal enforcement is critical to promote immigrants’ access to care and well-being.</p>

<p>A crucial aspect of clinical research is the informed consent of participants, a process which is rendered even more complex when a trial involves patients nearing the end of life where the research promises them little clinical benefit.</p>
<p>A study by Murphy <em>et al.</em> aimed at gaining greater understanding of how these patients make decisions regarding clinical trial participation. They interviewed non-curative cancer patients in the UK who had previously been invited to participate in a clinical trial, as well as some of the healthcare professionals involved in their care, oncologists and clinical research nurses.</p>
<p>Both the patients and healthcare professionals indicated that “nothing to lose” was a core aspect of the decision making process, from the part of a patient as a search for a life-line, and for the healthcare professionals as a way to maintain hope for the patients. Generally, the patients and healthcare professionals were found to have similar perspectives. Informed consent is critical to ensure patients are fully informed of the trial requirements and potential outcomes, a task which is both more difficult and more important considering the vulnerability of this particular population.</p>

<p>The transcriptome remains a vastly under explored space despite its significance as a foundation for biology. The current challenges in annotating eukaryotic transcriptomes are biological complexity, RNA preparation, limitations of sequencing technologies and sequence analysis. Accurate high-throughput long read transcript sequencing can provide additional evidence for rare transcripts and genes that were previously either undetectable or impossible to differentiate from sequencing noise.</p>
<p>Kuo <em>et al.</em> have developed the Transcriptome Annotation by Modular Algorithms (TAMA) software, aiming to leverage the power of long read transcript sequencing and address the issues with current processing pipelines. TAMA uses long read transcript data and high-quality reference genome assemblies to produce accurate and informative transcript models, improving transcript model prediction accuracy and increase transcriptome discovery with transparent and traceable steps.</p>
<p>TAMA, along with other commonly used tools, were used to analyse publicly available sequencing data (the Universal Human Reference RNA UHRR Sequel II Iso-Seq data), noted to have high read depth and long read accuracy. The use of parameter tuning and extensive output information of the TAMA software package allows for in depth exploration of eukaryotic transcriptomes. The authors found long read data based evidence for thousands of unannotated genes within the human genome. More development in sequencing library preparation and data processing are required for differentiating sequencing noise from real genes in long read RNA sequencing data.</p>

<p>In the UK, the number of overweight and obese men is higher than the number of women, however, men are less likely to participate in weight management programmes. In fact, little is known as to how to best recruit men to weight management programmes.</p>
<p>McDonald <em>et. al</em> sought input from both patients and the public in their pre-trial decisions in order to try and successfully recruit male participants for a men-only weight management intervention. Various aspects of the recruitment process were discussed, from recruitment materials, to the study’s catchy name: “Game of Stones”, chosen by popular vote.</p>
<p>The authors of this study concluded that no single strategy appealed to all men, but their mixed methods approach highlighted factors which contributed to successful recruitment, among them the importance of language and adopting a sensitive approach to recruit the men. Recruitment strategy decisions should be evidence based and involve input from target group members, and further work is required to examine how these strategies could be implemented and sustained in practice.</p>

<p>This week on Journal Club session Ohki Katakura will talk about a paper "Complex Dynamics in Simplified Neuronal Models: Reproducing Golgi Cell Electroresponsiveness".</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>Brain neurons exhibit complex electroresponsive properties – including intrinsic
subthreshold oscillations and pacemaking, resonance and phase-reset – which are
thought to play a critical role in controlling neural network dynamics. Although
these properties emerge from detailed representations of molecular-level
mechanisms in “realistic” models, they cannot usually be generated by simplified
neuronal models (although these may show spike-frequency adaptation and
bursting). We report here that this whole set of properties can be generated by
the extended generalized leaky integrate-and-fire (E-GLIF) neuron model. E-GLIF
derives from the GLIF model family and is therefore mono-compartmental, keeps
the limited computational load typical of a linear low-dimensional system,
admits analytical solutions and can be tuned through gradient-descent
algorithms. Importantly, E-GLIF is designed to maintain a correspondence between
model parameters and neuronal membrane mechanisms through a minimum set of
equations. In order to test its potential, E-GLIF was used to model a specific
neuron showing rich and complex electroresponsiveness, the cerebellar Golgi
cell, and was validated against experimental electrophysiological data recorded
from Golgi cells in acute cerebellar slices. During simulations, E-GLIF was
activated by stimulus patterns, including current steps and synaptic inputs,
identical to those used for the experiments. The results demonstrate that E-GLIF
can reproduce the whole set of complex neuronal dynamics typical of these
neurons – including intensity-frequency curves, spike-frequency adaptation,
post-inhibitory rebound bursting, spontaneous subthreshold oscillations,
resonance, and phase-reset – providing a new effective tool to investigate brain
dynamics in large-scale simulations.</p>

Three months ago I posted a request for help with OCR’ing and processing 19th Century Newspapers and we got soooo many offers to help.  Thank you, that was heart warming and concretely helpful– already based on these suggestions we are changing over our OCR and PDF software completely to FOSS, making big improvements, and building partnerships with FOSS developers in companies, universities, and as individuals that will propel the Internet Archive to have much better digitized texts.  I am so grateful, thank you.   So encouraging.

I posted a plea for help on the Internet Archive blog: Can You Help us Make the 19th Century Searchable? and we got many social media offers and over 50 comments the post– maybe a record response rate.   

We are already changing over our OCR to Tesseract/OCRopus and leveraging many PDF libraries to create compressed, accessible, and archival PDFs...."

The importance of higher education for the growth and development of society is generally accepted. But openness and access to education for all is essential to maximise its benefits. Leaders in higher education must be ready to examine what it will take to achieve this.

<p class="LO-normal"><span lang="EN">Neuroscience doesn’t only happen in the laboratory; it also happens at conferences. Academic meetings present many diverse opportunities for collaboration, networking, and professional development. At the same time, most workshops are expensive to put on, require time away from home, and leave a hefty carbon footprint on the environment. Further, in the wake of COVID-19, in-person conferences present too great a risk to the health of attendees. For this reason, virtual events have become a popular way to facilitate talks, discussions, and professional development.

<p>Steven Miller is a math professor at <a href="https://www.williams.edu/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">Williams College</a> who specializes in number theory and theoretical probability theory. A few days ago he published a “<a href="https://justthenews.com/sites/default/files/2020-11/Miller_DeclarationAndAnalyisPA_GOP_BallotRequestData_2020_Final.pdf" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">declaration</a>” in which he performs an “analysis” of phone bank data of registered Republicans in Pennsylvania. The data was provided to him by Matt Braynyard, who led  Trump’s data team during the 2016. Miller frames his “analysis” as an attempt to “estimate the number of fraudulent ballots in Pennsylvania”, and his analysis of the data leads him to conclude that</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>“almost surely…the number of ballots requested by someone other than the registered Republican is between 37,001 and 58,914, and almost surely the number of ballots requested by registered Republicans and returned but not counted is in the range from 38,910 to 56,483.”</p></blockquote>



<p><strong>A review of Miller’s “analysis” leads me to conclude that his estimates are fundamentally flawed and that the data as presented provide no evidence of voter fraud.</strong></p>



<p>This conclusion is easy to arrive at. The declaration claims (without a reference) that there were 165,412 mail-in ballots requested by registered Republicans in PA, but that “had not arrived to be counted” as of November 16th, 2020. The data Miller analyzed was based on an attempt to call some of these registered Republicans by phone to assess what happened to their ballots. The number of phone calls made, according to the declaration, is 23,184 = 17,000 + 3,500 + 2,684. The number 17,000 consists of phone calls that did not provide information either because an answering machine picked up instead of a person, or a person picked up and summarily hung up. 3,500 numbers were characterized as “bad numbers / language barrier”, and 2,684 individuals answered the phone. Curiously, Miller writes that “Almost 20,000 people were called”, when <a href="https://web.williams.edu/Mathematics/sjmiller/public_html/advice.htm#Writingapaper" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">in fact</a> 23,184 &gt; 20,000.  </p>



<p>In any case, clearly many of the phone numbers dialed were simply wrong numbers, as evident by the number of “bad” calls: 3,500. It’s easy to imagine how this can happen:  confusion because some individuals share a name, phone numbers have changed, people move, the phone call bank makes an error when dialing etc. Let <img alt="b" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=b&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=545454&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="b" /> be the fraction of phone numbers out of the 23,184 that were “bad”, i.e. incorrect. We can estimate <img alt="b" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=b&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=545454&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="b" /> by noting that we have some information about it: we know that the 3,500 “bad numbers” were bad (by definition). Additionally, it is reported in the declaration that 556 people literally said that they did not request a ballot, and there is no reason not to take them at their word. We don’t know what fraction of the 17,000 individuals called and did not pick up or hung up were wrong numbers, but we do know that the fraction out of the total must equal the fraction out of the 17,000 + those we know for sure were bad numbers, i.e.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center"><img alt="23184 \cdot b = 17,000 \cdot b + 556 + 3500" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=23184+%5Ccdot+b+%3D+17%2C000+%5Ccdot+b+%2B+556+%2B+3500&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=545454&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="23184 \cdot b = 17,000 \cdot b + 556 + 3500" />. </p>



<p>Solving for <img alt="b" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=b&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=545454&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="b" /> we find that <img alt="b \approx \frac{2}{3}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=b+%5Capprox+%5Cfrac%7B2%7D%7B3%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=545454&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="b \approx \frac{2}{3}" />. I’m surprised the number is so <em>low</em>. One would expect that individuals who requested ballots, but then didn’t send them in, would be enriched for people who have recently moved or are in the process of moving, or have other issues making it difficult to reach them or impossible to reach them at all. </p>



<p>The fraction of bad calls derived translates to about 1,700 bad numbers out of the 2,684 people that were reached. This easily explains not only the 556 individuals who said they did not request a ballot, but also the 463 individuals who said that they mailed back their ballots. In the case of the latter there is no irregularity; the number of bad calls suggests that all those individuals were reached in error and their ballots were legitimately counted so they weren’t part of the 165,412. It also explains the 544 individuals who said they voted in person.</p>



<p>That’s it. The data don’t point to any fraud or irregularity, just a poorly design poll with poor response rates and lots of erroneous information due to bad phone numbers. There is nothing to explain. Miller, on the other hand, has some things to explain.</p>



<p>First, I note that his declaration begins with a signed page asserting various facts about Steven Miller and the analysis he performed. Notably absent from the page, or anywhere else in the document, is a disclosure of funding source for the work and of conflicts of interest. On his <a href="https://web.williams.edu/Mathematics/sjmiller/public_html/advice.htm#Writingapaper" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">work webpage</a>, Miller specifically states that one should <strong>always acknowledge funding support</strong>.</p>



<p>Second, if Miller <em>really</em> wanted to understand the reason why some ballots were requested for mail-in, but had not yet arrived to be counted, he would also obtain data from Democrats. That would provide a control on various aspects of the analysis, and help to establish whether irregularities, if they were to be detected, were of a partisan nature. Why did Miller not include an analysis of such data?</p>



<p>Third, one might wonder why Steven Miller chose to publish this “declaration”. Surely a professor who has taught probability and statistics for 15 years (as Miller claims he has) must understand that his own “analysis” is fundamentally flawed, right? Then again, I’ve previously found that excellent pure mathematicians are prone to falling into a data analysis trap, i.e. a situation where their lack of experience analyzing real-world datasets leads them to believe naïve analysis that is deeply flawed. To better understand whether this might be the case with Miller, I examined his publication record, which he has shared publicly via <a href="https://web.archive.org/save/https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=5B8RWrkAAAAJ" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">Google</a><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=5B8RWrkAAAAJ" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"> Scholar, to see whether he has worked with data. The first thing I noticed </a>was that he has published more than 700 articles (!) and has an h-index of 47 for a total of 8,634 citations… an incredible record for any professor, and especially for a mathematician. A Google search for his name displays this impressive number of citations: </p>

<p>As it turns out, his impressive publication record  is a mirage. When I took a closer look and found that many of the papers he lists on his Google Scholar page are not his, but rather articles published by other authors with the name S Miller. <strong>“His” most cited article was published in 1955, a year that transpired well before he was born.</strong> Miller’s own most cited paper is a short unpublished tutorial on least squares (I was curious and reviewed it as well only to find some inaccuracies but hey, I don’t work for this guy).</p>



<p>I will note that in creating his Google Scholar page, Miller did not just enter his name and email address (required). He went to the effort of customizing the page, including the addition of keywords and a link to his homepage, and in doing so followed his own <a href="https://web.williams.edu/Mathematics/sjmiller/public_html/advice.htm" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">general advice </a>to curate one’s CV (strangely, he also dispenses advice on job interviews, including about shaving- I guess only women interview for jobs?). But I digress: the question is, why is his Google Scholar page display massively inflated publication statistics based on papers that are not his? <a href="https://liorpachter.wordpress.com/2019/11/18/how-many-doubly-manlocked-scientists-are-there/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">I’ve seen this before</a>, and in one case where I had hard evidence that it was done deliberately to mislead I reported it as fraud.  Regardless of Miller’s motivations, by looking at his actual publications I confirmed what I suspected, namely that he has hardly any experience analyzing real world data. I’m willing to chalk up his embarrassing “declaration” to statistics illiteracy and naïveté.</p>



<p>In summary, Steven Miller’s declaration provides no evidence whatsoever of voter fraud in Pennsylvania.</p>

<p>Neural probes with large number of close packed recording sites each comprising
of 32 electrodes are being developed for large scale neuronal recordings from
multiple brain areas simultaneously to understand complex brain activity in vivo.
By precisely mapping the position of each site inside rat brain, they help us to
characterize neural activity on the basis of cortical depth from where it is
obtained. Their application lies in neurosurgery, where it is important to locate
the target of surgical interest inside the brain in real time. In this work, we
have first compared various methods from literature to analyze extracellular
activity recorded using CMOS neural probes from different cortical depths and
from different locations along same lateral axis of rat brain to find a criterion
on the basis of which recordings can be classified. After finding out the most
promising criterion, we have tried to implement it on neuromorphic hardware
SpiNNaker. We tested single neuron and spiking excitatory-inhibitory network
for implementation and found that excitatory-inhibitory network is more robust to
noise present in signal and its output can be improved by introducing lateral
inhibition. Our results show that SpiNNaker can be used for rough indication of
cortical depth.</p>

<img alt="" class="attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image" height="110" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2020/11/democracy-5278455_640-140x110.jpg" style="display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;" width="140" /><p>Against a backdrop of the vote to leave the European Union, hostility towards migrants, and the growth in right-wing nationalist movements, racial discrimination is sadly on the rise in the UK. There is evidence that experiencing racial discrimination can negatively impact health. However, the majority of studies to date have been carried out in the US. The makeup of ethnic minority groups in the UK differs to that in the US, with those of South Asian backgrounds forming the largest minority group. Therefore, it is important to understand the extent to which racial discrimination impacts health in the UK-context.</p>
<blockquote><p>People who reported racial discrimination were more likely to rate their health as poor and to suffer from a limiting longstanding illness at follow-up</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="https://bmcpublichealth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12889-020-09792-1?utm_source=bmc_blogs&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=null&amp;utm_campaign=blog_2020_bmcseriesblog">Our study</a> looked at over 4800 people who took part in the UK Household Longitudinal Study over a period of two years. One in five participants from an ethnic minority group reported racial discrimination (which included feeling unsafe, avoiding certain places, being insulted and being physically attacked). We found that these individuals were more likely to develop poorer mental and physical health after these experiences. Specifically, we found that perceived racial discrimination was associated with increased psychological distress and poorer mental functioning two-years later. Moreover, people who reported racial discrimination were more likely to rate their health as poor and to suffer from a limiting longstanding illness at follow-up, regardless of their health at the time of the discriminatory experience.</p>
<p>The study builds upon previous research which has mostly measured racial discrimination and health at the same time, meaning that establishing the direction of the relationship is difficult. Here we show that the experience of racial discrimination precedes the development of poorer health. <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4984732/">One previous study</a> linked racial discrimination with a deterioration in mental health in a UK sample. Our findings build upon this evidence and show that the negative effects of racial discrimination extend to physical health also.</p>
<blockquote><p>Our findings suggest racial discrimination is a chronic stressor, that might bring about changes in stress-related biology and stress-related health behaviors</p></blockquote>
<p>But how can experiencing racial discrimination lead to serious health outcomes? At the individual level, our findings suggest racial discrimination is a chronic stressor, that might bring about changes in stress-related biology and stress-related health behaviors (e.g. excessive alcohol intake) that can lead to poor health. Feeling discriminated against might also mean that people avoid engaging with health or well-being services perceived to be discriminatory. At the broader structural level, racial discrimination might negatively impact health through inequalities in healthcare and the unfair distribution of social determinants of health such as education, employment, and housing.</p>
<p>The issue of racial discrimination is one that has garnered increasing attention, particularly this year in the wake of the Black Lives Matters protests. The results of our study are concerning suggesting an enduring impact of experiences of racism on mental and physical health. They highlight the need to tackle racial discrimination – not only as a human rights issue, but as an issue that may also have a lasting legacy on health. We need to educate, raise awareness, and promote activism to bring about legislative and social change required to eliminate racial discrimination both in the UK and worldwide. We also need to target the structural macro-level forces that shape the position of ethnic minorities in society. More research is needed to understand the pathways linking racial discrimination and health in order to develop interventions and policy that can be used to tackle socio-political processes that promote racial discrimination.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-center"><strong>Abstract</strong></p>



<p>A <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0960076020302764?via%3Dihub" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">recently published</a> pilot study on the efficacy of 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 (calcifediol) in reducing ICU admission of hospitalized COVID-19 patients, concluded that the treatment “seems able to reduce the severity of disease, but larger trials with groups properly matched will be required go show a definitive answer”. In a <a href="https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.11.08.20222638v1" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">follow-up</a> paper, Jungreis and <a href="https://liorpachter.wordpress.com/2014/02/11/the-network-nonsense-of-manolis-kellis/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">Kellis</a> re-examine this so-called “Córdoba study” and argue that the authors of the study have undersold their results. Based on a reanalysis of the data in a manner they describe as “rigorous” and using “well established statistical techniques”, they urge the medical community to “consider testing the vitamin D levels of all hospitalized COVID-19 patients, and taking remedial action for those who are deficient.” Their recommendation is based on two claims: in an examination of unevenness in the distribution of one of the comorbidities between cases and controls, they conclude that there is “no evidence of incorrect randomization”, and they present a “mathematical theorem” to make the case that the effect size in the Córdoba study is significant to the extent that “they can be confident that if assignment to the treatment group had no effect, we would not have observed these results simply due to chance.”</p>



<p>Unfortunately, the “mathematical analysis” of Jungreis and Kellis is deeply flawed, and their “theorem” is vacuous. Their analysis cannot be used to conclude that the Córdoba study shows that calcifediol significantly reduces ICU admission of hospitalized COVID- 19 patients. Moreover, the Córdoba study is fundamentally flawed, and therefore there is nothing to learn from it.</p>



<p><strong>The Córdoba study</strong></p>



<p>The Córdoba study, described by the authors as a pilot, was ostensibly a randomized controlled trial, designed to determine the efficacy of 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 in reducing ICU admission of hospitalized COVID-19 patients. The study consisted of 76 patients hospitalized for COVID-19 symptoms, with 50 of the patients treated with calcifediol, and 26 not receiving treatment. Patients were administered “standard care”, which according to the authors consisted of “a combination of hydroxychloroquine, azithromycin, and for patients with pneumonia and NEWS score 5, a broad spectrum antibiotic”. Crucially, admission to the ICU was determined by a “Selection Committee” consisting of intensivists, pulmonologists, internists, and members of an ethics committee. The Selection Committee based ICU admission decisions on the evaluation of several criteria, including presence of comorbidities, and the level of dependence of patients according to their needs and clinical criteria.</p>



<p>The result of the Córdoba trial was that only 1/50 of the treated patients was admitted to the ICU, whereas 13/26 of the untreated patients were admitted (p-value = 7.7 ∗ 10<sup>−7</sup> by Fisher’s exact test). This is a minuscule p-value but it is meaningless. Since there is no record of the Selection Committee deliberations, it impossible to know whether the ICU admission of the 13 untreated patients was due to their previous high blood pressure comorbidity. Perhaps the 11 treated patients with the comorbidity were not admitted to the ICU because they were older, and the Selection Committee considered their previous higher blood pressure to be more “normal” (14/50 treatment patients were over the age of 60, versus only 5/26 of the untreated patients).</p>

<p>The fact that admission to the ICU could be decided in part based on the presence of co-morbidities, and that there was a significant imbalance in one of the comorbidities, immediately renders the study results meaningless. There are several other problems with it that potentially confound the results: the study did not examine the Vitamin D levels of the treated patients, nor was the untreated group administered a placebo. Most importantly, the study numbers were tiny, with only 76 patients examined. Small studies are notoriously problematic, and are known to produce large effect sizes [9]. Furthermore, sloppiness in the study does not lead to confidence in the results. The authors state that the “rigorous protocol” for determining patient admission to the ICU is available as Supplementary Material, but there is no Supplementary Material distributed with the paper. There is also an embarrassing typo: Fisher’s exact test is referred to twice as “Fischer’s test”. To err once in describing this classical statistical test may be regarded as misfortune; to do it twice looks like carelessness.</p>



<p><strong>A pointless statistics exercise</strong></p>



<p>The Córdoba study has not received much attention, which is not surprising considering that by the authors’ own admission it was a pilot that at best only motivates a properly matched and powered randomized controlled trial. Indeed, the authors mention that such a trial (the COVIDIOL trial), with data being collected from 15 hospitals in Spain, is underway. Nevertheless, Jungreis and Kellis [3], apparently mesmerized by the 7.7 ∗ 10<sup>−7</sup> p-value for ICU admission upon treatment, felt the need to “rescue” the study with what amounts to faux statistical gravitas. They argue for immediate consideration of testing Vitamin D levels of hospitalized patients, so that “deficient” patients can be administered some form of Vitamin D “to the extent it can be done safely”. Their message has been noticed; only a few days after [3] appeared the authors’ tweet to promote it has been retweeted more than 50 times [8].</p>



<p>Jungreis and Kellis claim that the p-value for the effect of calcifediol on patients is so significant, that in and of itself it merits belief that administration of calcifediol does, in fact, prevent admission of patients to ICUs. To make their case, Jungreis and Kellis begin by acknowledging that imbalance between the treated and untreated groups in the previous high blood pressure comorbidity may be a problem, but claim that there is “no evidence of incorrect randomization.” Their argument is as follows: they note that while the p-value for the imbalance in the previous high blood pressure comorbidity is 0.0023, it should be adjusted for the fact that there are 15 distinct comorbidities, and that just by chance, when computing so many p-values, one might be small. First, an examination of Table 2 in [1] (Figure 1) shows that there were only 14 comorbidities assessed, as none of the patients had previous chronic kidney disease. Thus, the number 15 is incorrect. Second, Jungreis and Kellis argue that a Bonferroni correction should be applied, and that this correction should be based on 30 tests (=15 × 2). The reason for the factor of 2 is that they claim that when testing for imbalance, one should test for imbalance in both directions. By applying the Bonferroni correction to the p-values, they derive a “corrected” p-value for previous high blood pressure being imbalanced between groups of 0.069. They are wrong on several counts in deriving this number. To illustrate the problems we work through the calculation step-by-step:</p>



<p>The question we want to answer is as follows: given that there are multiple comorbidities, is there is a significant imbalance in <em>at least</em> one comorbidity. There are several ways to test for this, with the simplest being Šidák’s correction [10] given by</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center"><img alt="q \quad = \quad 1-(1-m)^n," class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=q+%5Cquad+%3D+%5Cquad+1-%281-m%29%5En%2C&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=545454&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="q \quad = \quad 1-(1-m)^n," /></p>



<p>where <em>m</em> is the minimum p-value among the comorbidities, and <em>n</em> is the number of tests. Plugging in <em>m = 0.0023</em> (the smallest p-value in Table 2 of [1]) and <em>n = 14</em> (the number of comorbidities) one gets 0.032 (note that the Bonferroni correction used by Jungreis And Kellis is the Taylor approximation to the Šidák correction when <em>m</em> is small). The Šidák correction is based on an assumption that the tests are independent. However, that is certainly not the case in the Córdoba study. For example, having at least one prognostic factor is one of the comorbidities tabulated. In other words, the p-value obtained is conservative. The calculation above uses n = 14, but Jungreis and Kellis reason that the number of tests is 30 = 15 × 2, to take into account an imbalance in either the treated or untreated direction. Here they are assuming two things: that two-sided tests for each comorbidity will produce double the p-value of a one-sided test, and that two sided tests are the “correct” tests to perform. They are wrong on both counts. First, the two-sided Fisher exact test does not, in general produce a p-value that is double the 1-sided test. The study result is a good example: 1/49 treated patients admitted to the ICU vs. 13/26 untreated patients produces a p-value of 7.7 ∗ 10<sup>−7</sup> for both the 1-sided and 2-sided tests. Jungreis and Kellis do not seem to know this can happen, nor understand why; they go to great lengths to explain the importance of conducting a 1-sided test for the study result. Second, there is a strong case to be made that a 1-sided test is the correct test to perform for the comorbidities. The concern is not whether there was an imbalance of any sort, but whether the imbalance would skew results by virtue of the study including too many untreated individuals with comorbidities. In any case, if one were to give Jungreis and Kellis the benefit of the doubt, and perform a two sided test, the corrected p-value for the previous high blood pressure comorbidity is 0.06 and not 0.069.</p>



<p>The most serious mistake that Jungreis and Kellis make, however, is in claiming that one can accept the null hypothesis of a hypothesis test when the p-value is greater than 0.05. The p-value they obtain is 0.069 which, even if it is taken at face value, is not grounds for claiming, as Jungreis and Kellis do, that “this is not significant evidence that the assignment was not random” and reason to conclude that there is “no evidence of incorrect randomization”. That is not how p-values work. A p-value less than 0.05 allows one to reject the null hypothesis (assuming 0.05 is the threshold chosen), but a p-value above the chosen threshold is not grounds for accepting the null. Moreover, the corrected p-value is 0.032 which is certainly grounds for rejecting the null hypothesis that the randomization was random.</p>



<p>Correction of the incorrect Jungreis and Kellis statistics may be a productive exercise in introductory undergraduate statistics for some, but it is pointless insofar as assessing the Córdoba study. While the extreme imbalance in the previous high blood pressure comorbidity is problematic because patients with the comorbidity may be more likely to get sick and require ICU admission, the study was so flawed that the exact p-value for the imbalance is a moot point. Given that the presence of comorbidities, not just their effect on patients, was a factor in determining which patients were admitted to the ICU, the extreme imbalance in the previous high blood pressure comorbidity renders the result of the study meaningless <em>ex facie</em>.</p>



<p><strong>A definition is not a theorem is not proof of efficacy</strong></p>



<p>In an effort to fend off criticism that the comorbidities of patients were improperly balanced in the study, Jungreis and Kellis go further and present a “theorem” they claim shows that there was a minuscule chance that an uneven distribution of comorbidities could render the study results not significant. The “theorem” is stated twice in their paper, and I’ve copied both theorem statements verbatim from their paper:</p>



<p><strong>Theorem 1</strong> <em>In a randomized study, let p be the p-value of the study results, and let q be the probability that the randomization assigns patients to the control group in such a way that the values of P<sub>prognostic</sub>(Patient) are sufficiently unevenly distributed between the treatment and control groups that the result of the study would no longer be statistically significant at the 95% level after p controlling for the prognostic risk factors. Then <img alt="q &lt; \frac{p}{0.05}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=q+%3C+%5Cfrac%7Bp%7D%7B0.05%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=545454&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="q &lt; \frac{p}{0.05}" />.</em></p>



<p>According to Jungreis and Kellis, <em>P<sub>prognostic</sub>(Patient)</em> is the following: “There can be any number of prognostic risk factors, but if we knew what all of them were, and their effect sizes, and the interactions among them, we could combine their effects into a single number for each patient, which is the probability, based on all known and yet-to-be discovered risk factors at the time of hospital admission, that the patient will require ICU care if not given the calcifediol treatment. Call this (unknown) probability <em>P<sub>prognostic</sub>(Patient)</em>.”</p>



<p>The theorem is restated in the Methods section of Jungreis and Kellis paper as follows:</p>



<p><strong>Theorem 2</strong> <em>In a randomized controlled study, let p be the p-value of the study outcome, and let q be the probability that the randomization distributes all prognostic risk factors combined sufficiently unevenly between the treatment and control groups that when controlling for these prognostic risk p factors the outcome would no longer be statistically significant at the 95% level. Then <img alt="q &lt; \frac{p}{0.05}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=q+%3C+%5Cfrac%7Bp%7D%7B0.05%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=545454&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="q &lt; \frac{p}{0.05}" />.</em></p>



<p>While it is difficult to decipher the language the “theorem” is written in, let alone its meaning (note Theorem 1 and Theorem 2 are supposedly the same theorem), I was able to glean something about its content from reading the “proof”. The mathematical content of whatever the theorem is supposed to mean, is the definition of conditional probability, namely that if A and B are events with <img alt="P(B) &gt; 0" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=P%28B%29+%3E+0&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=545454&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="P(B) &gt; 0" />, then</p>

<p>To be fair to Jungreis and Kellis, the “theorem” includes the observation that </p>



<p class="has-text-align-center"><img alt="P(A \cap B) \leq P(A) \quad \Rightarrow \quad P(A|B) \leq \frac{P(A)}{P(B)}." class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=P%28A+%5Ccap+B%29+%5Cleq+P%28A%29+%5Cquad+%5CRightarrow+%5Cquad+P%28A%7CB%29+%5Cleq+%5Cfrac%7BP%28A%29%7D%7BP%28B%29%7D.&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=545454&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="P(A \cap B) \leq P(A) \quad \Rightarrow \quad P(A|B) \leq \frac{P(A)}{P(B)}." /></p>



<p>This is not, by any stretch of the imagination, a “theorem”; it is literally the definition of conditional probability followed by an elementary inequality. The most generous interpretation of what Jungreis and Kellis were trying to do with this “theorem”, is that they were showing that the p-value for the study is so small, that it is small even after being multiplied by 20. There are less generous interpretations.</p>



<p><strong>Does Vitamin D intake reduce ICU admission?</strong></p>



<p>There has been a lot of interest in Vitamin D and its effects on human health over the past decade [2], and much speculation about its relevance for COVID-19 susceptibility and disease severity. One interesting result on disease susceptibility was published recently: in a study of 489 patients, it was found that the relative risk of testing positive for COVID-19 was 1.77 times greater for patients with likely deficient vitamin D status compared with patients with likely sufficient vitamin D status [7]. However, definitive results on Vitamin D and its relationship to COVID- 19 will have to await larger trials. One such trial, a large randomized clinical trial with 2,700 individuals sponsored by Brigham and Women’s Hospital, is currently underway [4]. While this study might shed some light on Vitamin D and COVID-19, it is prudent to keep in mind that the outcome is not certain. Vitamin D levels are confounded with many socioeconomic factors, making the identification of causal links difficult. In the meantime, it has been suggested that it makes sense for individuals to maintain reference nutrient intakes of Vitamin D [6]. Such a public health recommendation is not controversial.</p>



<p>As for Vitamin D administration to hospitalized COVID-19 patients reducing ICU admission, the best one can say about the Córdoba study is that nothing can be learned from it. Unfortunately, the poor study design, small sample size, availability of only summary statistics for the comorbidities, and imbalanced comorbidities among treated and untreated patients render the data useless. While it may be true that calcifediol administration to hospital patients reduces subsequent ICU admission, it may also not be true. Thus, the follow-up by Jungreis and Kellis is pointless at best. At worst, it is irresponsible propaganda, advocating for potentially dangerous treatment on the basis of shoddy arguments masked as “rigorous and well established statistical techniques”. It is surprising to see Jungreis and Kellis argue that it may be unethical to conduct a placebo randomized controlled trial, which is one of the most powerful tools in the development of safe and effective medical treatments. They write “the ethics of giving a placebo rather than treatment to a vitamin D deficient patient with this potentially fatal disease would need to be evaluated.” The evidence for such a policy is currently non-existent. On the other hand, there are plenty of known risks associated with excess Vitamin D [5].</p>

                <h4><a href="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/2020/11/16/can-science-be-musical/">Can science be musical?</a></h4>

<img alt="" class="attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image" height="110" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2017/05/DNA-music-notes-edited-140x110.jpg" style="display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;" width="140" /><p>I recently wrote <a href="https://bmcbioinformatics.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12859-020-03760-7?utm_source=bmc_blogs&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=null&amp;utm_campaign=blog_2020_bmcseriesblog">an article</a> for BMC describing the use of sound to describe the function of the coronavirus genome. It was a perplexing article to write since I was toing and froing about science and art. I was writing a science article which had an art component to it. Was I creating a technical auditory display or was I creating something that was musical? I think I was actually doing both. I have since realised that I was adding an ‘A for Art’ into Science Technology Engineering and Maths to make STE(A)M. I made something that is both functional and creative. I thought if it didn’t sound good then people would not use it as a science tool.</p>
<p>Amongst other things I have been making audio by copying the way a biological cell makes proteins</p>
<figure class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_12158" style="width: 310px;"><img alt="Temple, M.D. Real-time audio and visual display of the Coronavirus genome.

BMC Bioinformatics 21, 431 (2020)</div></figure>
<p>I also created an animated display which is synchronised to the audio. The animation scrolls the genomic sequence across the page as if it was interacting with proteins inside a human cell. I did this because I want the user to see the sequence pass by as you hear the audio. Our eyes are attracted to things that move and we naturally listen for patterns in what we hear. I thought the combination of the two would be greater than either in isolation. The music is never going to replace a well-designed (but silent) <a href="https://genome.ucsc.edu/">genome browser</a> but an audio track that is synchronised to a visual browser may help interpret the complex genomic sequences.</p>
<p>Video: <a href="https://youtu.be/2U8pMNuOdJM">https://youtu.be/2U8pMNuOdJM</a></p>
<p><strong>What is the music trying to say?</strong></p>
<p>For the purpose of this discussion let’s assume that I have used the coronavirus genome to make instrumental music, since this is often what is assumed. So, the question now is, what is the music trying to say? If it were composed by a human it might say something about the human condition in response to the virus. But the music was composed by a computer algorithm from the genomic sequence and therefore it tells us something about the function of the genome. It tells us something about how the genome is used to make proteins (translation) and how it makes new copies of itself (transcription).</p>
<p><strong>Imagine you are inside a human cell.</strong></p>
<p>To understand the music, you need to imagine that you are inside a human cell, you are a machine (such as a ribosome complex) moving along the viral genomic RNA sequence and converting it into a protein sequence, like a train running down a track. The music of translation begins at a slow tempo whilst we listen to an untranslated region. As we run into a gene sequence, another instrument starts to play the sound of a new protein being made and the music picks tempo up. Occasionally the music pauses in silence as we pass a cleavage point in a coronavirus protein. Almost randomly, syncopated high pitched notes sound out as we pass important regions called stop codons. Conversely, the effect of a start codon may be heard for many minutes after the text sequence has scrolled off the screen. The sound of these and other genomic attributes gives a narrative to the music.</p>
<p>If we are to use colors, shapes and font styles to tell us something about the sequence, then why not use music to tell us this is a new way? The fact that music has a beginning, middle and end is important since this makes us think about the order of features in the genome and this is important to understand their function.</p>
<p><strong>Is the sound musical in its own right? </strong></p>
<p>For days after I submitted the manuscript for review I had the <a href="https://theconversation.com/a-viral-hit-the-sequence-of-coronavirus-makes-surprisingly-lovely-music-147905">‘so c</a><a href="https://theconversation.com/a-viral-hit-the-sequence-of-coronavirus-makes-surprisingly-lovely-music-147905">alled music’</a> of the coronavirus genome in my head. I was wondering if other people would also consider it musical. Music can be inspiring, it should be creative and it can stir human emotion. In contrast, the sound of the coronavirus genome is minimal, repetitive and systematic. To make genomic data more musical I thought I should add some musicians into the mix. Literally!</p>
<p>A musician friend of mine (Mike Anderson) and I went into the music studio. We played the sound of the coronavirus genome very loudly over a big sound system. We set up drums and a loud guitar amp and we played along with the sequence. I made a simple recording of this and called it Coronacode music.</p>
<p>Video: <a href="https://youtu.be/2sG9O300Oz0">https://youtu.be/2sG9O300Oz0</a></p>
<p>After producing Coronacode music it made me think more about generative music (from a computer) versus musical improvisation. When we played along to the code it restricted what we were able to play and this constraint was a source of creativity. It snapped us out of our usual musical patterns and made us play something new. The repeating nucleotides A, U, G and C combine with the repeating drum pattern of kick, snare, tom, kick! Long guitar tones soften the incessant pulse of the coronavirus.</p>
<p><strong>Growing up in public.</strong></p>
<p>This approach is new to me. I think the use of sound to convey patterns in scientific data (sonification) has not yet come of age. Anecdotally I would say there is still skepticism within the scientific community regarding the value of sound. However, since computer browsers are now more capable to process data into audio and visuals I think we will see more instances of its application. If the audio and visual displays are tightly coupled and work together in harmony, then I think it will not only sound good but it will be more informative.</p>

<div><div><div><div><p><em>In the <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://blog.oup.com/2020/11/a-conversation-on-music-and-autism-part-one/">first part</a> of </em>Music and Autism: Speaking for Ourselves <em>author Michael Bakan’s interview with his Chapter 7 musician co-author Graeme Gibson (who is on the spectrum) and Graeme’s parents, the renowned science fiction novelist William (Bill) Gibson and autism researcher Dr Deborah Gibson</em><em>,</em><strong> </strong><em>things left off with Bill telling Michael about how being Graeme’s dad had influenced his creation of “unnervingly human” AI (Artificial Intelligence) characters in his novels. Next in the conversation, Michael invited Bill to talk about the very significant influence of music generally—and specific musicians in particular—on his creative process as a writer. We pick up the conversation from that point.  </em></p><p><strong>Michael (M):</strong> That’s really interesting [to learn how being Graeme’s father inspired your “humanization” of AI characters in your books], Bill, and leads me to another question, specifically having to do with how music has influenced you as a writer.</p><p><strong>Bill (B):</strong> Well, I’m not at all musical, and neither is Deb, but we have both in our lives been very, very intensely moved by music. I’m just kind of a folk and pop guy (Deb’s tastes are broader; she has a library of operas), but yes, music has influenced me greatly as a writer. When I was starting to write, around age twelve or thirteen, I loved science fiction and read a great whack of it. But then, you know, puberty arrived, and I thought it was like a childhood thing and put it on the side. But when I began to think about writing again, I was dismayed by how uncool, to my mind, the science fiction that was being produced in the late ‘70s, early ‘80s, was. I thought it had become like Nashville country: formulaic, nothing there that I would be interested in. And what I wanted science fiction to be, as I thought, was more like Dylan going electric.</p><p>So I was more consciously inspired by Steely Dan’s lyrics than I was by any of the science fiction that I could see being written when I first started to write. Then I found there were other people around trying for the same effect, other writers whose science fiction <em>looked </em>more like Steely Dan’s lyrics than the rest of the science fiction that was written… And when I started going to London on publishing-related business, the best science fiction store in town was right across the street from the studios where David Bowie recorded his first three or four albums. And the people in the stores—they would have loved David Bowie anyways—but they particularly loved him because he’d always been one of their very best customers, since before he started recording. And they could see that he was taking what he was buying from them, taking it home, fully digesting it, and bringing it back into the recording studio. So that’s an art of sound thing in its own way. I love it that I know that story and that I know it’s true.</p><p><strong>M:</strong> So do you feel that there’s some similar kind of process, specifically relative to music, that went on in your own writing?</p><p><strong>B:</strong> No, it was more like an ambition that there could be an analogy, and I knew that some of the most progressive science fiction being written when I was fourteen years old was being written by people who were already being inspired by the roots of the music of what we think of as the ‘60s. But their influence had faded away by the time I came back in my mid-twenties after getting a BA in English literature, and I was looking at contemporary science fiction and going, “Oh, man. This is not happening for me.” So my ambition was to, you know, make that analogy happen again… I remember listening to Bruce Springsteen’s “Nebraska” and imagining what it would be like if it were a science fiction novel.</p><p><strong>M:</strong> Wow.</p><p><strong>B: </strong>That was what I would do. I would listen to a piece of music and it would really move me and be unlike anything quite like what I’d heard before. And I’d think, “Yeah, but what would that be like if it were a piece of science fiction? What would that look like as a piece of science fiction?” And that would be a starting point for something.</p><div><figure><img height="270" src="https://blog.oup.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Eg1aF5qKfJg.jpg" width="300" />Bill with Graeme reading. Photo by Dr Deborah Gibson, used with permission.</figure></div><p><strong>M:</strong> Fascinating! Over to you, Deborah. What essential lessons has being Graeme’s mom taught you, and how have those lessons impacted your life?</p><p><strong>D:</strong> So one of the things I learned, I guess <em>had</em> to learn, was that we had to create our own experience and ways to get Graeme his best life, and ways for us to get through it without going completely berserk <em>[laughter]. </em>It was hard because there wasn’t the level of support that there is now, and we were, like, very impoverished really—well, not really—but we were very low income earners at the time. So it was difficult, but I managed, and I realized that I had to get another persona in order to find out what I wanted to know about Graeme, because every test that he had, everything that I pushed for, they would just give me the “mom” version.</p><p>And I knew there was another version that went amongst the professionals, that would use medical vocabulary and such. I needed to learn it, and I did learn it (that knowledge base eventually became the foundation for my PhD dissertation research, in fact, which was a case study on Graeme’s language acquisition) and I was able, therefore, to push quite far into getting information about Graeme that made me then feel like I had the information to take to, say, the school board or medical world, and to ask for things that were not there.</p><p>You know, Graeme was the first child with autism that that was integrated into the Vancouver School Board, to not be in a segregated class. And so I think just having a child who was “different” pushed me in a way that I was unwillingly pushed, but that nonetheless was an important maturation. I had a very cute baby, and one that was enchantingly different from others I knew. And it was delightful! Graeme’s babyhood was not all difficulties. He was so funny, and unique—very strong in what he liked and what he didn’t like. And what he liked were dots on the wall. He liked to find these microscopic dots and do this thing with sound, and touching them very slowly, and then screaming. He would play with things for hours and hours, but he hated primary colors, and all the toys were in primary colors. It was just really interesting, and often comical, and, I don’t know, there were wonderful things about being Graeme’s mother, wonderful things that I definitely wouldn’t have experienced if he had been a more “typical” child.</p><p><strong>M:</strong> Let’s bring it all back full circle to Graeme. Graeme, what are three lessons you would like readers to take away from this interview, especially relative to your experiences as a member of your family?</p><p><strong>G:</strong> First, I’ll always say that you have to keep in mind that all people on the spectrum are different from each other. People on the spectrum have different needs. You have to find a way to accommodate their needs, to meet them on their own terms. You have to know who they are individually. So that in itself is more the challenge, but once that’s established, in my family we’ve gone much beyond that, so it’s pretty continuous in the way that information flows from me to Mom and Dad by email or in person. I’ve gotten very good at asking for what I need, and at articulating what I want, and what I don’t want.</p><p>The second thing I’ll talk about, which is actually related, is the constant communication. That’s what keeps us together in my family, even though we don’t spend very much time actually together anymore, except when we travel, like the trip to England last year.</p><p>Third would probably be mutual support, like how my parents have found me teachers and other people who have helped me to develop my skills, like my music teacher Randy Raine-Reusch, and when I was young, my music therapist Johanne Brodeur. That does count in the overall picture.</p><p><strong>M:</strong> Those are great. Thanks, Graeme. Deborah? Bill? Anything to add along related lines?</p><p><strong>D:</strong> I think I have to keep being reminded that I have to respect Graeme’s boundaries about what is really hard for him. Because there are lots of things that I think would be maybe fun to do, and Graeme finds them difficult in ways that I haven’t expected. Or I’ll suggest something that’s spontaneous, and that doesn’t work for Graeme. He likes to plan ahead. So I have to keep being reminded, even though it’s been 43 years, that there are big differences between what I think is easy and what Graeme finds easy. In lots of ways it can be, in my opinion, something small that Graeme sticks on, but for him it’s huge, so that’s something that I’ve had to adjust to.</p><p><strong>M:</strong> Yes, that’s so important. Bill?</p><p>B. I’ll just amplify what Deb said, that respecting who Graeme is has been really, really essential, and like an ongoing project for sure. It’s not something one perfectly masters.</p><p><strong>D:</strong> Yeah, like having this interview happen today, and getting Graeme’s cooperation, was something we really had to work on together. You sitting here for all this time—almost an hour and a half—mainly listening to us talk? I thank you for that, Graeme.</p><p><strong>G:</strong> Mm-hmm…</p><p><strong>M:</strong> And I thank all of you. This has been really enlightening, and inspiring!</p><p> </p><p><em>Feature image by <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://unsplash.com/photos/slItfWbhijc">Syd Wachs</a>. </em></p></div></div></div></div><p>The post <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://blog.oup.com/2020/11/a-conversation-on-music-and-autism-part-two/">A conversation on music and autism (part two)</a> appeared first on <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://blog.oup.com">OUPblog</a>.</p><img align="left" border="0" height="1" hspace="0" src="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/i/638687634/0/oupblogpsychology" style="border: 0; float: left; margin: 0; padding: 0; width: 1px!important; height: 1px!important;" width="1" /><div style="clear: both; padding-top: 0.2em;"><a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/2/638687634/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/fbshare20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/28/638687634/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/fblike20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/30/638687634/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/googleplus20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/16/638687634/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/linkedin20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/29/638687634/oupblogpsychology,https%3a%2f%2fblog.oup.com%2fwp-content%2fuploads%2f2020%2f10%2fEg1aF5qKfJg.jpg"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/pinterest20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/1/638687634/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/reddit20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/24/638687634/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/twitter20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/19/638687634/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/email20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/20/638687634/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/rss20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a><h3 style="clear: left; padding-top: 10px;">Related Stories</h3><ul><li><a href="https://blog.oup.com/2020/11/a-conversation-on-music-and-autism-part-one/" rel="nofollow">A conversation on music and autism (part one)</a></li><li><a href="https://blog.oup.com/2020/11/bruce-lee-and-the-invention-of-martial-arts/" rel="nofollow">Bruce Lee and the invention of martial arts</a></li><li><a href="https://blog.oup.com/2020/11/so-you-think-you-know-shakespeare-quiz/" rel="nofollow">So you think you know Shakespeare?

<p> </p>
<p>No one wants to find errors in their work, but there’s something even worse: errors that pass through undetected, causing headaches later.</p>
<p>arXiv relies on TeXLive 2020 as a compilation system to ensure precise formatting of the submissions from our authors. During the submission process, authors upload their TeX files to the arXiv system, which then compiles them into a PDF. Now, compilation errors will be highlighted during the submission process, helping authors save time and submit their work smoothly.</p>
<p> </p>
<figure class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_796" style="width: 583px;"><img alt="Image of TeX error highlighting" class="wp-image-796 size-full" height="243" src="https://blog.arxiv.org/files/2020/10/TeX-Error-Highlighting-Key.png" width="583" />TeX errors detected by the arXiv submission system are now color-coded</figure>
<p> </p>
<p>Different types of compilation errors might arise during the submission process. Some errors are so severe that the submission system will not compile the source files into a PDF until they are resolved. For example, if the TeX source references a file that the author forgot to include, processing will fail. Other errors are less obvious at first glance. For example, an error might interfere with formatting, making the content less understandable, or, if references are missing, a question mark will appear instead of numbers corresponding to the bibliography.</p>
<p>During the compilation process, AutoTeX log files are produced automatically and errors are noted within. In the past, many users found the large block of text challenging to read and interpret quickly.</p>
<p>Now, errors are highlighted with different colors within the AutoTeX logs during the submission process. Authors can quickly scan a summary of errors, understand their severity, and follow links to relevant arXiv help pages. Additionally, if the source did compile, the number of pages produced is also noted, so authors can confirm that the paper length matches their expectation.</p>
<p> </p>
<figure class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_801" style="width: 1024px;"><a href="https://blog.arxiv.org/files/2020/10/Critical-TeX-Error.png"><img alt="image of critical tex error summary" class="wp-image-801 size-large" height="311" src="https://blog.arxiv.org/files/2020/10/Critical-TeX-Error-1024x311.png" width="1024" /></a>This example shows the summary of critical errors, attempted compilation runs, and a link to the relevant arXiv help page.</figure>
<p> </p>
<p>By scrolling down the AutoTeX log, authors will find specific errors highlighted in various colors.</p>
<figure class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_802" style="width: 818px;"><a href="https://blog.arxiv.org/files/2020/10/TeX-Error-Example.png"><img alt="TeX Error highlighting example" class="wp-image-802 size-full" height="693" src="https://blog.arxiv.org/files/2020/10/TeX-Error-Example.png" width="818" /></a>In this example, an error log shows where the specific errors occurred.</figure>
<p> </p>
<p>arXiv aims to serve both readers and authors by ensuring that research can be shared quickly and easily. This AutoTeX log highlighting feature was specifically requested by arXiv authors and will likely improve their experience. Readers will also benefit because, with fewer technical errors, articles will be easier to read.</p>

<h2>Background</h2><p class="">In the 16th century, an eminent French<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barber_surgeon"> barber surgeon</a> named Ambroise Pare noted—with amazement—that some of his patients who had undergone limb amputation complained months later that they still felt sensations (including pain) coming from their missing limb. Pare’s observation is thought to be the first recorded description of <em>phantom limb</em>, a condition in which sensations continue to occur in a part of the body that has been lost (due to accident or injury) or surgically removed. Despite the name, phantom limb doesn’t only occur in limbs, and has also been recorded after the loss or removal of other parts of the body—like breasts, genitals, <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15101965/" target="_blank">and even teeth</a>.</p><p class="">Although Pare wrote about phantom limb in the 1500s, the term <em>phantom limb</em> wouldn’t first be used until the Civil War—more than three centuries later. At that time, the renowned physician Silas Weir Mitchell was an army surgeon stationed at the South Street Hospital in Philadelphia. So many amputees were treated at South Street Hospital (especially after the Battle of Gettysburg) that <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/5325361/" target="_blank">soldiers called it “Stump Hospital.”</a> Mitchell noted that most of the amputees he treated there continued to experience sensations from their missing limbs. He described these lingering sensations as “sensory ghosts” or “phantoms,” which led to the use of the term <em>phantom limb</em> to describe the condition.</p><p class="">Today, phantom sensations are recognized as a common experience in those who have lost a limb. It’s thought that <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17053811/" target="_blank">almost all amputees have phantom sensations</a>, and the majority of them also suffer from some degree of phantom pain. In one study of 5000 American veterans, for example, <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/6709380/" target="_blank">78% of them reported experiencing phantom pain in their amputated limbs</a>. </p><p class="">The presentation of phantom sensations can vary from patient to patient. In most cases, the sensations begin almost immediately after the surgery or injury that led to the loss of the limb (after consciousness has returned and any anesthetic has worn off). <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9762952/" target="_blank">But in about a quarter of patients</a>, the sensations may not appear for several days or weeks. Sometimes the phantom sensations fade away after a few days or weeks, but in other cases they persist for years—or even decades.</p><p class="">In many patients, the phantom limb takes on a habitual posture (e.g., arm slightly bent). But that posture may change spontaneously, and some patients complain that their phantom limb ends up in awkward positions that generate discomfort and pain. <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9762952/" target="_blank">One anecdotal report describes a patient</a> who lost a limb after a grenade exploded in it. He complained that his phantom hand was perpetually held in a painful, tightly-clenched fist.</p><p class="" data-rte-preserve-empty="true"></p><h2>What causes phantom limb?</h2><p class="">Phantom limb is still not very well understood. A number of hypotheses have been proposed to explain it, but it’s likely that the underlying mechanism differs slightly from case to case. In this article, I’ll discuss a few of the most common explanations for phantom limb. In an individual patient, it’s very possible more than one of the following mechanisms is at play—or that other explanations altogether are involved.</p><h3>Changes to the central nervous system</h3>

<p class="">The prevailing explanation for phantom limb sensations is an idea known as <em>cortical reorganization</em> or <em>cortical remapping</em>. To explain this hypothesis, let’s consider the case of an individual who loses their arm in an accident. Before the accident, <a href="https://www.neuroscientificallychallenged.com/glossary/neuron" target="_blank">neurons</a> that carried sensations from the arm communicated with neurons in a region known as the <a href="https://www.neuroscientificallychallenged.com/glossary/primary-somatosensory-cortex" target="_blank">somatosensory cortex</a>, which receives information about touch, pain, temperature, and <a href="https://www.neuroscientificallychallenged.com/glossary/proprioception" target="_blank">proprioception</a> (i.e., the position of the body in space) from all over the body. Specifically, neurons carrying information from the arm interact with neurons in a part of the somatosensory cortex devoted to processing information about arm sensations. </p><p class="">After the accident, however, those somatosensory neurons are deprived of their normal source of neuronal input. Consequently, they begin to respond to signaling from other nearby neurons. This can cause sensations felt in other parts of the body (e.g., the face) to lead to the stimulation of neurons in the somatosensory cortex that are devoted to the (now missing) arm. The activation of these “arm” somatosensory neurons causes the brain to perceive sensations in the arm, even though it is no longer there. The extent to which this type of maladaptive cortical reorganization <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/7777055/" target="_blank">occurs is correlated with the severity of phantom limb pain</a>. </p><p class="">It should be noted that reorganization in non-cortical areas, like the <a href="https://www.neuroscientificallychallenged.com/glossary/thalamus" target="_blank">thalamus</a> (a <a href="https://www.neuroscientificallychallenged.com/glossary/subcortical" target="_blank">subcortical</a> structure involved in processing nearly all incoming sensory information) <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9450753/" target="_blank">also seems to play a role</a> in some phantom sensations.</p><h3>Body representation</h3><p class="">Another popular explanation for phantom limb centers around the idea that the brain typically relies on an internal representation of the body for generating an awareness of where our body is in space—and thus for maintaining posture, making movements, etc. This internal representation of the body is likely created by networks of neurons that integrate information of various types in the brain (e.g., tactile, visual—even emotional). </p><p class="">According to some researchers, the internal representation of the body can be the root of phantom limb sensations and pain. This might occur when, after a limb is lost, the body representation remains intact. In other words, the representation of the body generated in the patient’s brain still includes the intact limb, creating an expectation or sense that the limb is still present. This might lead to abnormal sensations, discomfort, or pain when incoming sensory information conflicts with the neural body representation (e.g., the eyes see that no leg is present, but the brain still expects a leg to be there). </p><h3>Peripheral nervous system</h3><p class="">In the early days of phantom limb research, the <a href="https://www.neuroscientificallychallenged.com/glossary/peripheral-nervous-system" target="_blank">peripheral nervous system</a> was thought to be the sole cause of phantom limb pain. Today, explanations typically involve the <a href="https://www.neuroscientificallychallenged.com/glossary/central-nervous-system" target="_blank">central nervous system</a> as well, but the peripheral nervous system is still believed to be an important factor. </p><p class="">After the loss of a limb, the damaged <a href="https://www.neuroscientificallychallenged.com/glossary/axon" target="_blank">axons</a> that once supplied the limb don’t simply stay idle. Instead, they often attempt to repair themselves by growing new extensions (a process called <em>sprouting</em>). After loss of a limb, however, these new extensions essentially have nowhere to go. They form a mass of neural tissue at the site of amputation called a <em>neuroma</em>.</p><p class="">The axons that make up the neuroma do not remain dormant. Instead, they can generate <a href="https://www.neuroscientificallychallenged.com/glossary/action-potential" target="_blank">action potentials</a> in an erratic manner. This aberrant signaling is thought to be a potential mechanism underlying some of the spontaneous pain phantom limb patients can experience. The abnormal neural activity might be exacerbated by pathological signaling coming from the area where the axons from the missing limb enter the <a href="https://www.neuroscientificallychallenged.com/glossary/spinal-cord" target="_blank">spinal cord</a>.</p><p class="" data-rte-preserve-empty="true"></p><h2>Treatments for phantom limb pain</h2><p class="">There are a number of pharmacological treatments for phantom limb pain. They include many of the same pain-relieving drugs used to treat other types of neuropathic pain, such as anticonvulsant and opioid drugs.

<p class="">One unique approach to treating phantom limb pain is called <em>mirror therapy</em>. In this technique, a mirror is situated between the missing and intact limb so it reflects the patient’s intact limb. This creates the illusion (from the patient’s perspective) that they have two intact limbs. They can move their intact limb and observe the illusory limb moving in the same manner. It is thought that this imagery may help to reduce some of the discomfort caused by the lack of visual feedback from a missing limb that the brain has maintained an internal representation of. </p><p class="">Although <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18032777/" target="_blank">studies support the effectiveness of mirror therapy</a>, the mechanisms underlying why the approach works are not fully understood. Some <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24327313/" target="_blank">research, however, suggests mirror therapy may </a>help to reverse the post-amputation cortical reorganization mentioned above. The effectiveness of mirror therapy has increased interest in similar approaches, like using virtual reality to create a representation of a limb. </p><p class="" data-rte-preserve-empty="true"></p><h3>References (in addition to linked text above):</h3><p class="">Collins KL, Russell HG, Schumacher PJ, Robinson-Freeman KE, O'Conor EC, Gibney KD, Yambem O, Dykes RW, Waters RS, Tsao JW.

It combines tools and methods from biology and medicine with mathematics, physical sciences and engineering towards the understanding of human biology and disease and the improvement of human health.</p>
<p>We spoke with one of <em>BMC Biomedical Engineering</em>‘s Editorial Board Members (EBMs), Professor Seeram Ramakrishna from the National University of Singapore, about his perspective on the journal.</p>
<p><strong>Q: When and how did you become an EBM for <em>BMC Biomedical Engineering</em>?</strong></p>
<p><strong>A:</strong> <em>BMC Biomedical Engineering</em> was launched in 2018, and published its first article in January 2019. I was invited to submit a review article to <em>BMC Biomedical Engineering</em> by the Editor, Dr. Lingling Tian. I was impressed with the professionalism and quality of the peer review process, and hence got interested in <em>BMC Biomedical Engineering</em>. Upon invitation and foresight discussions with Lingling, I gladly accepted to join the editorial board of <em>BMC Biomedical Engineering</em> in July 2020.</p>
<blockquote><p>As <em>BMC Biomedical Engineering</em> provides an international peer-reviewed platform for these important areas, I am convinced that it will facilitate advances in the biomedical engineering community with the ultimate goal of improving human healthcare.</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>Q: Compared with other journals in the field, especially well-known ones, what makes <em>BMC Biomedical Engineering </em>different?</strong></p>
<p><strong>A:</strong> <em>BMC Biomedical Engineering</em> considers quality articles on all aspects of biomedical engineering.  Specific topics include biomaterials, nanomedicine, regenerative medicine, tissue engineering, medical technologies, robotics and rehabilitation engineering, Biomechanics, biosensors and bioelectronics, and Biomedical Imaging. As <em>BMC Biomedical Engineering</em> provides an international peer-reviewed platform for these important areas, I am convinced that it will facilitate advances in the biomedical engineering community with the ultimate goal of improving human healthcare.</p>
<p>In addition, BMC is a pioneer of open access publishing. This year makes the 20<sup>th</sup> anniversary of BMC! As part of the BMC Series journals, <em>BMC Biomedical Engineering</em> is a fully open access journal. Published articles are free to read and share.</p>
<p><strong>Q: How’s the paper quality of the journal and what’s your opinion on the <a href="https://bmcbiomedeng.biomedcentral.com/about?utm_source=bmc_blogs&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=null&amp;utm_campaign=blog_2020_bmcseriesblog">review policy</a>?</strong></p>
<p><strong>A:</strong> <em>BMC Biomedical Engineering</em> has a professional in-house editorial team, with support from a strong and international <a href="https://bmcbiomedeng.biomedcentral.com/about/editorial-board?utm_source=bmc_blogs&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=null&amp;utm_campaign=blog_2020_bmcseriesblog">editorial board</a>. It offers a rigorous, efficient and fair peer review service. Since its launch, <em>BMC Biomedical Engineering</em> has been receiving good quality submissions from around the world. <em>BMC Biomedical Engineering</em>‘s editorial policy requires that the reported studies must be scientifically valid; for research articles, this includes a scientifically-sound research question, the use of suitable methods and analysis, and following community-agreed standards relevant to the research field.  <em>BMC Biomedical Engineering</em> achieved a good measure of success with 42 <a href="https://bmcbiomedeng.biomedcentral.com/articles?utm_source=bmc_blogs&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=null&amp;utm_campaign=blog_2020_bmcseriesblog">articles published</a> and consistently improves its standards.</p>
<p><strong>Q: Could you please share what suggestions you have for the journal’s future development?</strong></p>
<p><strong>A:</strong> We aim to grow <em>BMC Biomedical Engineering</em> into a renowned biomedical engineering journal with global impact in the next few years. This is a very promising biomedical engineering journal, on which I aspire to publish my own work.</p>
<p>In addition, I would encourage the Editors to provide more support to the authors in the research community, in particular to the junior ones who are at their early stage of research. They might be not very experienced with writing and publishing their research in scientific journal. The editors could support them by giving presentations or seminars on topics.</p>
<p><strong>Q: What suggestions do you have for young researchers and author who would like to submit their paper to open access journal?</strong></p>
<p><strong>A:</strong> Open access is a good way to share and disseminate knowledge, which gives readers free and instant access, enabling faster discovery of the latest research. Young researchers are encouraged to submit their work to open access journal if their funding allows.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/638548362/0/oupblogpsychology/">A conversation on music and autism (part one)</a></h4>

<div><div><div><div><p><em>Earlier this year, </em>Music and Autism: Speaking for Ourselves <em>author Michael B. Bakan sat down for a Zoom conversation with his Chapter 7 co-author, the Vancouver-based multi-instrumentalist and music instrument collector Graeme Gibson, and with Graeme’s parents, autism researcher Dr. Deborah Gibson and bestselling science fiction author William (Bill) Gibson. Their four-way conversation covered a range of topics, from how raising a child on the spectrum shaped Bill’s writing of iconic novels like </em>Neuromancer, <em>to how Deborah’s advocacy on Graeme’s behalf helped to spearhead the movement toward inclusive public education in Vancouver, to how Graeme’s abiding fascination with musical instruments—combined with his prodigious research and memory—enabled him to identify virtually every instrument in the expansive world instrument collection of London’s Horniman Museum. Here is part one of the interview; <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://blog.oup.com/2020/11/a-conversation-on-music-and-autism-part-two/">read part two here</a>. </em></p><p><strong>Michael (M):</strong> Hello, Graeme, Deborah, and Bill! Thank you so much for doing this interview. I’ve really been looking forward to it.</p><p>Graeme, a question for you for starters: You have a collection of, what, more than 400 musical instruments? And these instruments are from all over the world, and you can actually <em>play</em> most of them, some very well, which is really impressive. How did your interest in musical instruments start?</p><p><strong>Bill (B):</strong> Wasn’t there a little electric keyboard you used to play when you were really little?</p><p><strong>Graeme (G):</strong> Oh yeah, yeah, yeah. There was, and that’s also what propelled me to be able to learn where the notes are laid out on the keyboard.</p><p><strong>Deborah (D):</strong> Actually, it wasn’t electric—Michael, I think I sent you a picture of Graeme playing it when he was a toddler—it was this tuneless<em> </em>little wooden toy piano that we got him for his second Christmas (he was one year old), and he was so mesmerized by it. From the time he was a baby, Graeme was just so interested in sound, and he showed a real affinity for instruments of all kinds. He liked Santa’s jingle bells more than any other present. He was just drawn to music and sound, and when we had records he would <em>insist</em> on Bill playing them over and over again. At that point he was signing rather than speaking, and he would make a very insistent gesture, spinning his finger around in circles like a record spinning on a turntable, to say to Bill, ‘Play it again, play it again!’</p><div><figure><img height="239" src="https://blog.oup.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Eg1Tuffkyk4-1.jpg" width="300" />Graeme with toy piano. Photo by Dr Deborah Gibson, used with permission.</figure></div><p><strong>G:</strong> Then later, when I was a teenager, I did have an electronic keyboard—a Casio SK1, and I would play that for many hours every day.</p><p><strong>D:</strong> And then, all of a sudden, you asked for a balalaika!</p><p><strong>G:</strong> Yeah, yeah. In terms of instruments from other world cultures, my first major acquisition was a Russian balalaika.</p><p><strong>B:</strong> What I remember is that Graeme walked up to me one day and said, “I want a balalaika.” <em>[Graeme laughs]</em> And I only barely knew what a balalaika was: it’s triangular, it’s a Russian, like… something. How on earth do you think you ever decided to get a balalaika?</p><p><strong>G:</strong> I might have heard it somewhere, maybe the radio or something. I sort of had an idea of what it was and the way that it was played. It’s just the way my ears pick it up. I wish I could explain that, but unfortunately, I can’t translate that software here, so… And later, especially after I started studying with my music teacher Randy Raine-Reusch, who owns thousands of instruments from around the world, he introduced me to many other instruments as well—especially stringed instruments, which are my specialty—and my collection grew and grew. Now I have an <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~museumofworldmusic.com/">online instrument museum</a> where people can visit my collection.</p><p><strong>M:</strong> Right, and I seem to recall that you enjoy visiting “live” musical instrument museums as well, right, Graeme?</p><p><strong>G:</strong> Yes! Like last year, when Mom and Dad and I went to London.</p><p><strong>D:</strong> There was a wonderful museum of ethnic musical instruments.</p><p><strong>G:</strong> Yeah! The Horniman Museum in, uh… I forget where exactly it is, but, uh…</p><p><strong>D:</strong> It wasn’t close.</p><p><strong>G:</strong> No, it was far, but well worth it.</p><p><strong>D:</strong> And Graeme knew the name of every single instrument without even looking at the label.</p><p><strong>G:</strong> Yes.</p><p><strong>D:</strong> He was the most incredible museum guide, and he would describe the slight discrepancies between that version of the instrument and then the one that came from twenty miles further south. It was a real eye opener for me on how much Graeme knows about music, about instruments, about all things music-related.</p><p><strong>M:</strong> Yes, his knowledge—of instruments, the Indian <em>raga </em>system, you name it—is immense. When I assign our chapter in the <em>Music and Autism</em> book to my students, I’ll say to them, ‘Check out how much this guy knows. You’re Ph.D. ethnomusicology students; you should know as much as he does!’ <em>[laughter]</em></p><p><strong>D:</strong> And we have to thank Randy [Raine-Reusch] for that. He’s just been an extraordinary teacher for Graeme.<em> </em>And as far back as when he was a baby, it wasn’t just music and instruments that interested Graeme. It was sounds of <em>all</em> kinds. When the fridge went on and off…</p><p><strong>G:</strong> Usually around 9 p.m. or so. <em>[Deborah and Bill laugh]</em> Yeah, yeah. There would always be that time, sometime in the evening, when it was very routine. You’d hear the click, and then you’d hear the fridge cycles. <em>[Deborah laughs]</em></p><p><strong>D:</strong> I gotta say, I never, ever paid attention to our fridge before in that way. <em>[laughter] </em></p><div><figure><img height="200" src="https://blog.oup.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Eg1borx4S-A.jpg" width="300" />Graeme with some of his instruments. Photo by Michael O’Shea, used with permission.</figure></div><p><strong>M:</strong> A question for you now, Bill. At the same time that you were being a stay-at-home dad to Graeme, in the late 1970s/early 1980s, you were also working on your first novel, <em>Neuromancer</em>, which would of course bring you considerable fame—not to mention revolutionize the literature of science fiction, inspire the iconic <em>Matrix </em>film series, and (along with some of your earlier short stories) even change the English language with your coining of the term “<a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://oed.com/view/Entry/240849">cyberspace</a>” and such. I have to think that being a first-time dad—and a dad to Graeme in particular—would have influenced your writing during that time. True?</p><p><strong>B:</strong> I think that being Graeme’s dad made me think more actively about consciousness and perception than I would have otherwise, that is, had I not had that experience, because I had the example of Graeme totally perceiving everything, but perceiving it often in a slightly other way. And I think, particularly for someone that writes the sort of fiction I write, that’s a hugely useful example to have every day, as opposed to, you know, watching everyone else doing what everyone else is doing with the information they’re receiving, although that’s essential too.</p><p>Also, on a practical level, as it became more evident that Graeme wasn’t “just any baby,” it sort of upped the ante on what I was doing. And I also was in a situation where if I was going to be doing anything other than co-parenting Graeme, the perfect thing to do would be trying to become a writer, because you do it from home, literally any time of day, you know, whenever Graeme was asleep, for instance, which is when I did a lot of my writing. So, in some ways it was sort of a natural fit. Yeah, I can’t think of anything else I could have done. And I was lucky, because I was able to make a living at being a freelance writer of fiction, even though, looking back on it, there’s almost no one else I ever knew who tried to do that who was able to do it; they all wound up having day jobs. And I have yet to have one, I’m happy to say.</p><p>And there’s one other thing I’ve wondered about, too, that seems relevant to your question. Something that’s been consistent through my work are characters who are AIs, they’re Artificial Intelligences, but are unnervingly human in their presentation, and seemingly in their consciousness. As far as I know they’re much more totally human than we have any right to expect Artificial Intelligences in the future to be, at least so far. So, something that happens, I know from watching reader feedback, is that readers become invested in the AI’s humanity, but then are occasionally henceforth startled by moments of cognitive dissonance where they realize that it’s human but it’s not quite standardly human. And that’s the result of me, if it were music <em>playing</em> it a certain way, to get that effect of deliberately going slightly off key to remind the reader that the character’s not “standard issue” human. And, you know, that may be something subsequent to being Graeme’s dad.</p><p><a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://blog.oup.com/2020/11/a-conversation-on-music-and-autism-part-two/">Read part two of the interview here.</a></p><p> </p><p><em>Feature image by <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://unsplash.com/photos/cW3nDFVpi10">Karim Manjra</a></em></p></div></div></div></div><p>The post <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://blog.oup.com/2020/11/a-conversation-on-music-and-autism-part-one/">A conversation on music and autism (part one)</a> appeared first on <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://blog.oup.com">OUPblog</a>.</p><img align="left" border="0" height="1" hspace="0" src="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/i/638548362/0/oupblogpsychology" style="border: 0; float: left; margin: 0; padding: 0; width: 1px!important; height: 1px!important;" width="1" /><div style="clear: both; padding-top: 0.2em;"><a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/2/638548362/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/fbshare20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/28/638548362/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/fblike20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/30/638548362/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/googleplus20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/16/638548362/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/linkedin20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/29/638548362/oupblogpsychology,https%3a%2f%2fblog.oup.com%2fwp-content%2fuploads%2f2020%2f10%2fEg1Tuffkyk4-1.jpg"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/pinterest20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/1/638548362/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/reddit20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/24/638548362/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/twitter20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/19/638548362/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/email20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/20/638548362/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/rss20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a><h3 style="clear: left; padding-top: 10px;">Related Stories</h3><ul><li><a href="https://blog.oup.com/2020/11/a-conversation-on-music-and-autism-part-two/" rel="nofollow">A conversation on music and autism (part two)</a></li><li><a href="https://blog.oup.com/2020/11/bruce-lee-and-the-invention-of-martial-arts/" rel="nofollow">Bruce Lee and the invention of martial arts</a></li><li><a href="https://blog.oup.com/2020/11/so-you-think-you-know-shakespeare-quiz/" rel="nofollow">So you think you know Shakespeare?

<p>Starting today, authors now have a new license option for their submitted works, the <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/">CC BY-NC-ND</a>. This is the <strong>Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivs</strong> license, which stipulates that others can share the work only with proper attribution and no commercial or derivative works can be made from it.</p>
<figure class="wp-caption alignright" id="attachment_781" style="width: 150px;"><img alt="image of creative commons logo" class="wp-image-781 size-thumbnail" height="150" src="https://blog.arxiv.org/files/2020/11/createive-commons-logo-150x150.png" width="150" />Creative Commons helps overcome legal obstacles to knowledge sharing</figure>
<p>When an author submits work to arXiv, they choose from a selection of licenses that prescribe how others can –or cannot– use their article. This is critical because, as a repository for scholarly material, arXiv keeps a permanent record of every article and version posted. arXiv needs permission from the copyright holder to host and distribute the work. Permission is granted through a license, chosen by the person who submits the work, and the submitter must certify that they have the right to grant that license.</p>
<p>Authors often ask arXiv for advice on choosing the appropriate license. In general, arXiv values openness and encourages choosing a liberal license for reuse of articles. However, each situation is unique, and arXiv cannot make any specific recommendations. Authors need to consider that journals have different policies regarding preprints, embargo periods, and post-publication distribution. Funding and government agencies might require specific licenses. The license chosen during arXiv submission is irrevocable and cannot be changed, but different versions of the same work can have different licenses.</p>
<figure class="wp-caption alignleft" id="attachment_778" style="width: 1341px;"><img alt="screenshot of license options" class="wp-image-778 size-full" height="227" src="https://blog.arxiv.org/files/2020/11/List-of-available-licenses-with-arrow.png" width="1341" />Available licenses are listed in the submission system. The purple arrow points to the new option, CC BY-NC-ND.</figure>
<p> </p>
<p>The <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/">CC BY-NC-ND</a> license was added to arXiv’s selections because many authors submit works that have already been accepted to journals, which each have their own unique policies regarding copyright and article reuse. With this option, authors can comply with the policies of some journals, while also extending permissions to arXiv and others to openly share their work.</p>
<p>Ultimately, it is the submitter’s responsibility to choose the appropriate license for their content, obtain permission from their coauthors, and certify that they have the right to grant that specific license.</p>
<p>In addition to seeing the new option, authors may notice that the order of the licenses listed in the submission system has changed. The licenses, with the exception of CC Zero, are now ordered from most liberal re-use at the top (CC-BY) to most limited re-use (arXiv.org perpetual non-exclusive). For the top five options, the original copyright holder retains ownership after posting on arXiv. The exception, CC Zero, is rarely used and allows creators to waive their right to enforce copyright and put their works into the worldwide public domain.</p>

<p>This week on Journal Club session Minghua Zheng will talk about the paper "Bacterial colony counting with Convolutional Neural Networks in Digital Microbiology Imaging".</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>Counting bacterial colonies on microbiological culture plates is a
time-consuming, error-prone, nevertheless essential quantitative task in Clinica
Microbiology Laboratories. With this work we explore the possibility to find
effective solutions to the above issue by designing and testing two different
machine learning approaches. The first one is based on the extraction of a
complete set of handcrafted morphometric and radiometric features used within a
Support Vector Machines solution. The second one is based on the design and
configuration of a Convolutional Neural Networks deep learning architecture. To
validate, in a real and challenging clinical scenario, the proposed bacterial
load estimation techniques, we built and publicly released a fully labeled large
and representative database of both single and aggregated bacterial colonies
extracted from routine clinical laboratory culture plates. Dataset enhancement
approaches have also been experimentally tested for performance optimization.
The adopted deep learning approach outperformed the handcrafted feature based
one, and also a conventional reference technique, by a large margin, becoming a
preferable solution for the addressed Digital Microbiology Imaging quantification
task, especially in the emerging context of Full Laboratory Automation systems.</p>

                <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/~r/plos/Blog/~3/Pk7WuAFkREY/">PLOS ONE Issues First Publication from Children’s Tumor Foundation Partnership</a></h4>

<p><em>The Children’s Tumor Foundation issued the following press release on November 5, 2020</em></p>



<p>The Children’s Tumor Foundation (CTF), the foremost funder of neurofibromatosis (NF) research, and <em>PLOS ONE</em>, a leading peer-reviewed scientific journal, are pleased to release the first output of the Drug Discovery Initiative Registered Reports (DDIRR) Award, which CTF and <em>PLOS ONE</em> <a href="https://www.ctf.org/news/ctf-plos-one-funder-publisher-partnership">first announced in 2017</a>. The Registered Reports model, first piloted by CTF and PLOS ONE, ensures that all valid research – both successes and failures in the lab and clinics – are made public.</p>



<p>The publication, titled <em>Evaluating modified diets and dietary supplement therapies for reducing muscle lipid accumulation and improving muscle function in neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1), </em>by Dr. Aaron Schindeler, PhD, associate professor at the University of Sydney, reports <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0237097">findings</a> on L-Carnitine as an effective dietary supplement for reducing muscle lipid accumulation and potentially addresses muscle weakness and fatigue often observed in NF1 patients. The result of the study led to the opening of a <a href="https://apps.who.int/trialsearch/Trial2.aspx?TrialID=ACTRN12618002021257">clinical trial</a> for NF1 patients.</p>



<p>The Funder-Publisher Partnership around the DDIRR program allows researchers to preregister their study, obtain an in-principle acceptance (IPA) to publication in the journal <em>PLOS ONE</em>, and obtain funding from the Children’s Tumor Foundation to conduct their proposed experiments. Both CTF and <em>PLOS ONE</em> maintain a separate and independent review process to align proposed research with both the funder mission as well as to safeguard soundness, accuracy, and scientific rigor. Through this model, before any experiments start, researchers have the opportunity to address reviewer remarks and submit revisions of their protocol until it is ready for publication.</p>



<p>The innovation of this new funding model creates multiple benefits for all participants. Researchers are able to make adjustments to their protocols before they start any lab experiment, funders are ensured that the quality of the proposed research is high quality, and the publisher secures a manuscript that has robust reproducibility in line with the mission and ethos of the journal. In addition, the published manuscript links to the original registered protocol deposited on the Open Science Framework <a href="https://osf.io/rr/">portal</a> for full transparency and traceability.</p>



<p>“We are very proud to see the first manuscript of this new award program out, the transparency and the quantity of the protocol adds to the soundness of the research, independent from the nature of the outcome,” said Salvatore La Rosa, PhD, Chief Scientific Officer, Children’s Tumor Foundation. “Positive or negative results are equally valuable when a robust protocol is applied, and this model allows for either to emerge.”</p>



<p>“I am delighted that our partnership with the Children’s Tumor Foundation has resulted in the first publication of a preregistered study,” adds Joerg Heber, PLOS Editorial Director and Editor-in-Chief of PLOS ONE. “This scheme ensures the robustness of the research conducted and is a win for openness and transparency in research.”</p>

The hope is that the journals can be gradually moved away from having to charge APCs and that the publishing costs can be shared as widely as possible.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><span>Specifically, PLOS is inviting universities to pay an annual flat fee that will give their faculty unlimited publishing opportunities in the journals (there are separate “communities” for each journal) without the need to pay an APC each time. However, authors of institutions who do not join the scheme will be charged a non-member fee (NMF) that will increase in price over time, as below.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><span></span></p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-jBuQYsYdVI8/X6JCQEJvisI/AAAAAAAAsAk/HphLhyB7rQ06TMomwtKPnAa1ry6qNLxNACNcBGAsYHQ/s437/NMF.png" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" data-original-height="162" data-original-width="437" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-jBuQYsYdVI8/X6JCQEJvisI/AAAAAAAAsAk/HphLhyB7rQ06TMomwtKPnAa1ry6qNLxNACNcBGAsYHQ/s16000/NMF.png" /></a></div><p></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><span>The rising cost of the NMF is intended to encourage universities who have not joined to do so in order to avoid their faculty having to pay to publish.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><span>PLOS hopes that the annual fees will be low enough to attract a sufficient number of institutions but that the pooled funds will eventually be adequate to meet all the costs of publishing the journals. In the interim, the NMF means that there will be two separate revenue streams coming in and the free riding issue will be avoided.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><span>The hope is that the NMF can be discontinued when the pilot period ends (it lasts from 2021 until 2023). However, says PLOS Director of Strategic Partnerships Sara Rouhi, that will be dependent on all the large institutions that PLOS is targeting joining the scheme. “If we don’t have a stable membership by then, we might have to offset lack of participation with more NMFs”, she told me. </span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><span><span style="font-size: large;"><b>Tiers</b></span></span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><span>The annual fee institutions will be asked to pay will be calculated by looking at their faculty’s publishing activity between 2014 and Q3 2019. Based on that they will then be assigned to a fee tier, as below.</span></p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-CJXHcnHxe8o/X6JDAxwqvKI/AAAAAAAAsAw/-oOizaA3C1grfshy9z2Ga3xFzScF2up3QCNcBGAsYHQ/s412/Tiers.png" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" data-original-height="289" data-original-width="412" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-CJXHcnHxe8o/X6JDAxwqvKI/AAAAAAAAsAw/-oOizaA3C1grfshy9z2Ga3xFzScF2up3QCNcBGAsYHQ/s16000/Tiers.png" /></a></div><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><span>To help broaden the pool, the annual fee will be calculated on the publishing activity not just of the institution’s corresponding authors, but of their contributing authors too. The aim is to ensure that “the cost of publishing is distributed more equitably among representative institutions.”</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><span>In other words, PLOS will calculate how often during the historical publishing activity period an institution was associated with both corresponding and contributing authors and then assign a weighting to each type of author. Specifically, contributing-author articles will be weighted at half that of corresponding authors.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><span>As the PLOS FAQ </span><a href="https://plos.org/resources/for-institutions/faqs/"><span>explains</span></a><span>: “Publishing activity is counted by determining the number of times an institution was associated with a corresponding author <i>and</i> the number of times an institution was associated with contributing authors. Papers where the institution is affiliated with the corresponding authors are weighted as 1 article and papers where the institution is affiliated with the contributing author are weighted as ½ article. (Multiple contributing authors from the same institutions are counted only once).”</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><span>Universities whose faculty have never published in the journals can also opt to pay the tier’s lowest fee in order to “insure” themselves against the possibility that one or more of their faculty might publish in the journal within the time period of the scheme (Jan 1</span><sup>st</sup><span> 2021 –</span><span>  </span><span>Dec 31</span><sup>st</sup><span>2023).</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><span>In addition, says PLOS, Research4Life countries are automatically members of each community so researchers in those countries will never be subject to fees. And authors unable to pay non-member fees can apply for waivers as per the standard fee-waiver mechanisms offered by PLOS.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><span>To signal its own commitment to the community PLOS has set targets for each journal and will cap its margin at 10%. Revenue exceeding the community targets will go back to members at renewal.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><span>Time will tell how successful the scheme will be in broadening the pool beyond the 300 libraries who normally join OA membership schemes. Certainly, the challenge will be that much greater given that it is being launched at a time when many libraries are signing expensive <a href="https://esac-initiative.org/about/transformative-agreements/#:~:text=Transformative%20agreements%20are%20those%20contracts%20negotiated%20between%20institutions,fair%20price%20for%20their%20open%20access%20publishing%20services.">transformative agreements</a> with legacy publishers and universities are facing the financial impact of the pandemic.

So rather than think of different types of “institutions,” it’s easier to think of different publishing activity “types” – publishing as a lead author, publishing as a contributing author, or publishing with affiliations in both designations.</span></p><p class="MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle"><span>Given the selectivity and niche of these journals, some research-intensive universities publish little to not-at-all, and smaller institutions publish more frequently as lead authors. Simplifying the participation criterion to </span><b><i>just</i></b><span>publishing activity elides the traditional distinction of “research intensive” vs. “teaching” institutions etc.</span></p><p class="MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle"><span>I don’t want to add further confusion by grouping institutions as you’ve indicated.

There’s some nuance worth flagging, however. </span></p><p class="MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle"><span>The TL;DR is that Martin’s statement is true if you assume institutions that are participating for largely altruistic reasons – because it’s the “right thing to do.” The PLOS CAP model couldn’t be predicated on that as a buying motivation. So it helps to go back to “collective action” basics. Credit to Dr. Kamran Naim for elucidating this at the Basel Sustainable Publishing Forum last week.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><span>For collective action schemes to work there are generally two levers you can pull: </span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><span> </span></p><p class="MsoListParagraphCxSpFirst"><span>1.<span>       </span></span><span>Encourage “pro-collective” behaviour by leveraging group affinity and social incentives</span></p><p class="MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm; margin-left: 37.5pt; margin-right: 0cm; margin-top: 0cm; margin: 0cm 0cm 0cm 37.5pt;"><span> </span></p><p class="MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle">       </p><p class="MsoListParagraphCxSpLast"><span>2.<span>       </span></span><span>Appeal to economic self-interest (aka “private benefit”)</span></p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><br /></div><p class="MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle"><span>From my perspective, </span><a href="https://scoap3.org/"><span>SCOAP 3</span></a><span> and OLH lean heavily on the first lever. Participating in them is the “right” thing to do so libraries support them.</span></p><p class="MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle"><span>The challenge with only pulling on this lever is sustainability over time. SCOAP3 relies heavily on CERN’s ongoing support and has the challenge of large beneficiaries like Russia, Brazil and India not participating while benefitting from the open content.</span></p><p class="MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle"><span>OLH memberships are very small financial commitments that maintain OLH but make growth of the program difficult. Martin talked about this on a webinar we did for UKSG earlier in the year.</span></p><p class="MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle"><span>A collective model that focuses primarily on the second lever is <a href="https://www.blogger.com/blog/post/edit/7961882/6701287299563734785">Subscribe2Open</a>.</span><span> The primary benefit is getting the community to agree to make content open in exchange for a discount. If all members do not opt-in, the content stays behind a paywall. The combination of a private benefit (the discount) with the public good (making the content open) is a strong motivator for participation and a big part of why the model is so successful.</span></p><p class="MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle"><span>PLOS Community Action Publishing attempts to pull both levers. The pro-collective/group affinity/social incentives relates to the moral imperative – especially in a time of pandemic – to make biomedical research open to read and open to publish. </span><a href="https://library.duke.edu/about/directory/staff/jeff.kosokoff"><span>Jeff Kosokoff’s</span></a><span> comment that “Open Access <i>is</i> social justice,” speaks to this. Indeed, we have many commitments based on this mission-aligned priority for libraries. However what has interested partners from mere interest to actual commitment is the equitable fee structure (and relative affordability given the current budget crisis).</span></p><p class="MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle"><span>That said, without including appeals to economic self-interest, the PLOS CAP model would suffer from the same sustainability issues as other collectives. Hence our implementation of a secondary, “back up” revenue stream – non-member fees (NMFs) for authors from non-CAP members.</span></p><p class="MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle"><span>These NFMs are not meant to penalize authors but rather to encourage libraries to join rather than expose their authors to fees. For many institutions, the NMFs per article will be higher than the annual fee the library would pay to join one or both collectives.</span></p><p class="MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle"><span><b><span style="font-size: large;">Benefits</span></b></span></p><p class="MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle"><span>The NMFs help offset slow uptake of institutions who are not able to find the funds to support a model like this immediately. Thanks to those fees coming in, libraries can take more time to join and we can offer flexibility for institutions that need to leave the collective.</span></p><p class="MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle"><span>There are several benefits to this:</span></p><p class="MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle"><span>Enlarging the pool of institutions that would participate in this collective gives us the flexibility to create a much finer tuned fee structure with a long tail of low dollar fee tiers to accommodate institutions that do not publish frequently in either journal.</span></p><p class="MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle"><span>Those low fee tiers allow institutions strapped for funds and/or infrequent publishing institutions to participate because they support the moral imperative of equity and inclusivity that the model promotes. It simply doesn’t cost them that much to “do the right thing.”</span></p><p class="MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle"><span>Research intensive institutions then derive benefit from the “research light” institutions participating since they offset some of the cost burden. More institutions of varying publishing intensity means lower fees for everyone.</span></p><p class="MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle"><span>So, Martin is right if you’re counting only relatively wealthy institutions that want to do the “right thing.” If you start adding other considerations, especially private benefits (aka, we don’t want our authors to see non-member fees) and recognition of contributing author affiliations, you get a much larger pool and set of incentives to motivate ongoing participation.</span></p><p class="MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle"><span style="font-size: large;"><b>Targets</b></span></p><p class="MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle"><span><b>As for our target institutions:</b></span></p><p class="MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle"><span>For </span><i>PLOS Medicine</i><span>there are<b> 909 total institutions</b> with some publishing history (some combination of lead and co-author affiliations) in the time period we evaluated.</span></p><p class="MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle"><span><b>44 of those are in Tiers 1-4</b></span></p><p class="MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle"><span><b>80 are in Tiers 5-7</b></span></p><p class="MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle"><span><b>The remainder are in Tiers 8-12</b></span></p><p class="MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle"><span>For </span><i>PLOS Biology</i><span>there are <b>1,557 total institutions</b> with some publishing history (some combination of lead and co-author affiliations) in the time period we evaluated.</span></p><p class="MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle"><span><b>45 are in Tiers 1-5</b></span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><span><b>152 are in Tiers 6-8</b></span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><span><b>The remainder are in Tiers 9-12 </b></span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><span>As I say, I wouldn’t necessarily correlate rough groupings of similar institutions as “corresponding author institutions, contributing author institutions, and insurance institutions” especially since it does not include the thousands of organisations with no publishing history who might want to participate. </span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><span>However, it’s probably fair to say that the highest tiers have institutions that published a lot in both designations.

<p>This week on Journal Club session Samuel Sutton will talk about the paper "Navigation Along Windborne Plumes of Pheromone and Resource-Linked Odors".</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>Many insects locate resources such as a mate, a host, or food by flying upwind along the odor plumes that these resources emit to their source. A windborne plume has a turbulent structure comprised of odor filaments interspersed with clean air. As it propagates downwind, the plume becomes more dispersed and dilute, but filaments with concentrations above the threshold required to elicit a behavioral response from receiving organisms can persist for long distances. Flying insects orient along plumes by steering upwind, triggered by the optomotor reaction. Sequential measurements of differences in odor concentration are unreliable indicators of distance to or direction of the odor source. Plume intermittency and the plume's fine-scale structure can play a role in setting an insect's upwind course. The prowess of insects in navigating to odor sources has spawned bioinspired virtual models and even odor-seeking robots, although some of these approaches use mechanisms that are unnecessarily complex and probably exceed an insect's processing capabilities.</p>

<img alt="" class="attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image" height="110" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2020/11/Blog-140x110.jpg" style="display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;" width="140" /><p>In contemporary society, <a href="https://www.who.int/healthinfo/survey/whoqol-qualityoflife/en/">quality of life (QoL)</a> is a term used by economists, politicians, and people working across a range of other sectors and fields.  It is a concept used to measure the well-being of a population and societies, with various dimensions that can include material living situation and the environment, as well as subjective perceptions of an individual’s level of contentment with their life.</p>
<p>To healthcare professionals, quality of life has a more specific meaning, and is sometimes referred to as <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/hrqol/index.htm">Health-Related Quality of Life (HRQoL)</a>. HRQoL is an individual’s perception of how they view their general health status which includes physical wellness, emotional well-being, and social functioning. HRQoL is now frequently used in the clinical setting to monitor the quality of healthcare services given to patients, as patients are increasingly recognised as the centre of the healthcare system in today’s era.</p>
<p>A patient’s self-reported HRQoL has been shown to provide a good measure of their overall health status; reflecting their disease burden, mental well-being and social wellness that they experience. Indeed, there is increasing evidence that for patients with various health conditions, their self-report of HRQoL provides a good measure of their future health outcomes. What is less clear however, is whether HRQoL could also be used in the general community population, rather than just patients, to predict an individual’s future health; and thus, to help identify those individuals who are at risk of poorer health outcomes and where active interventions might be required. A systematic review is needed to provide robust evidence to address this question.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.cochrane.org/news/what-are-systematic-reviews">A systematic review</a> is important because it provide a comprehensive summary that includes all of the published studies which have investigated a given research question. For this reason, it is considered less prone to bias, including all relevant data rather than selecting data which confirms an existing hypothesis. Therefore, the finding from a clearly defined and robustly conducted systematic review can provide solid evidence which can then be used for developing clinical recommendations and making evidence-based policies. This was the premise for our study.</p>
<p>We undertook the first systematic review to determine whether an individual’s HRQoL was a good predictor of their future risk of dying. Our review included data from 47 studies with a total of approximately 1,200,000 participants living in the community (both with and without existing health conditions). Most participants were aged 65 years and older.</p>
<p>The studies varied in their duration, with some being very short (9 months between when the HRQoL was measured and death was recorded), and others much longer, by following participants for up to 18 years after HRQoL was assessed.</p>
<p>Our study found that individuals who reported poorer HRQoL were more likely to die and in a shorter time. Interestingly, we found that poorer physical HRQoL rather than mental HRQoL was most predictive of their risk of dying during the study.</p>
<p>Ultimately, we suggest that doctors should incorporate a HRQoL questionnaire into an annual screening checklist for individuals attending their clinical practice. This could be used to identify individuals at higher risk for future adverse health outcomes, and who may not otherwise be detected. This practice could in turn enable initiation of active interventions for those individuals at high risk of poorer health outcomes.</p>

<p><strong>Improving intracortical brain–computer interfaces through new power designs</strong></p>
<p>Recent technological advances have given intracortical brain-computer interfaces (iBCIs) enormous potential for widespread human clinical use. But current devices are limited by the number of recording channels, which largely depends on the power budget of the system. What if we could create new designs that save on power, but still allow for efficient brain-computer interface units? Researchers at Stanford University are working on exactly that. The lab of <a href="https://shenoy.people.stanford.edu/overview">Dr. Krishna Shenoy</a><strong><a href="https://www.ninds.nih.gov/exit_disclaimer"><img alt="external link" src="https://brainupdateblog.files.wordpress.com/2015/01/external_link_20x20.png?w=1540" style="height: 10px; width: 10px; background: none !important; border: none !important;" title="This graphic notice means that you are leaving an NINDS website. Click to view our external website policy." /></a></strong> at Stanford University recently published a <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32747834/">paper that examined which design specifications (specifically in regard to power) can be relaxed without sacrificing brain-interface device performance</a>. <a href="https://www.braingate.org/team/leigh-hochberg-m-d-ph-d/">Dr. Leigh Hochberg</a><strong><a href="https://www.ninds.nih.gov/exit_disclaimer"><img alt="external link" src="https://brainupdateblog.files.wordpress.com/2015/01/external_link_20x20.png?w=1540" style="height: 10px; width: 10px; background: none !important; border: none !important;" title="This graphic notice means that you are leaving an NINDS website. Click to view our external website policy." /></a></strong> from Brown University and Harvard Medical School is also working on this problem with Dr. Shenoy’s team. Here, researchers proposed a new power-efficient approach by analyzing signals collected from experimental iBCI measurements in rhesus macaques and a single BrainGate2 clinical trial participant with a spinal cord injury implanted with a 96-channel Utah multielectrode array. The paper focused on three questions: 1) what type of signal should be recorded from the brain; 2) how reliable this signal should be; and 3) how the resulting new specifications will affect the iBCI neural interface design, with particular emphasis on its power consumption, in order to understand the trade-offs between signal quality and decoder performance. Altogether, their analysis led them to propose less stringent, custom circuit design parameters related to signal collection, processing, and decoding that enable a more power-efficient iBCI hardware design. Overall, their minimalistic design may lead to improved iBCIs for clinical use and suggest that conventional iBCI parameters can be relaxed without loss of performance. Although this study primarily looked at decoding movement, these results have important implications for other types of clinically relevant neural interfaces, such as those used in retinal prostheses and the peripheral nervous system.</p>

<p><strong>Independent parallel hierarchies of timescales within the cortex</strong></p>
<p>The brain is incredibly heterogeneous, motivating neuroscientists to seek out a better way to organize it into distinct areas. Perhaps unsurprisingly, each brain area performs its own unique neural computations. For example, we know that the timescale at which neural responses fluctuate differs across areas, and recent studies have proposed the progression of timescales in neural responses as an organizing principle. But up until now, the relationships between such timescales and their dependence on response properties of individual neurons have been largely unknown, making it impossible to link the neural basis of these principles to other aspects of neural processing and to behavior. The lab of <a href="http://ccnl.dartmouth.edu/alireza-soltani/">Dr. Alireza Soltani</a><strong><a href="https://www.ninds.nih.gov/exit_disclaimer"><img alt="external link" src="https://brainupdateblog.files.wordpress.com/2015/01/external_link_20x20.png?w=1540" style="height: 10px; width: 10px; background: none !important; border: none !important;" title="This graphic notice means that you are leaving an NINDS website. Click to view our external website policy." /></a></strong> at Dartmouth College has recently published a <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32839338/">study that developed a novel and comprehensive method</a> to simultaneously estimate multiple timescales in neuronal dynamics and integration of signals (along with selectivity to those signals) in a decision-making task. Essentially, the overarching goal of work such as this is to understand how activity at the level of individual neurons gives rise to more sophisticated computational processes. In this study, researchers analyzed the activity of 866 single neurons in four cortical areas (lateral intraparietal cortex; dorsomedial prefrontal cortex; dorsolateral prefrontal cortex; and anterior cingulate cortex, ACC) in rhesus macaques, which are implicated in decision making and reinforcement learning. During the decision-making task, they estimated the timescales associated with the intrinsic and seasonal autoregressive (AR) components of the neural responses. Other factors were captured by using two exponential memory-trace components (filters) to describe the fluctuations of each neuron’s response at specific timepoints. After the validation of this estimation method and fitting procedure, the researchers used many different models (32) to fit individual neurons’ response in order to identify the best model for each neuron based on multiple factors. Overall, their results suggest that there are separate mechanisms underlying the generation of multiple timescales. Interestingly, neurons with no choice selectivity tended to integrate reward feedback over time. This research is valuable because it demonstrates that the timescales of neural dynamics across cortical areas can in fact be used as an organizational principle to understand brain computational processes.</p>

<p><strong>From the gut to the brain: the progression of protein aggregations associated with Parkinson’s disease</strong></p>
<p>Neurodegenerative conditions such as Parkinson’s disease (PD) can be characterized in part by the aggregations of protein, especially α-synuclein (α-Syn) protein. In a world with a growing aged population, determining the pathogenesis of age-related brain disorders is particularly important. In regard to PD, there is mounting evidence to suggest that α-Syn protein accumulation associated with the motor symptoms of PD begins, not in the brain, but the gastrointestinal (GI) system. <a href="http://glab.caltech.edu/">Dr. Viviana Gradinaru</a><strong><a href="https://www.ninds.nih.gov/exit_disclaimer"><img alt="external link" src="https://brainupdateblog.files.wordpress.com/2015/01/external_link_20x20.png?w=1540" style="height: 10px; width: 10px; background: none !important; border: none !important;" title="This graphic notice means that you are leaving an NINDS website. Click to view our external website policy." /></a></strong> and her team at California Institute of Technology recently provide evidence for this relationship. Specifically, they asked whether this <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32066981/">protein accumulation starts in the GI and ascends to the brain via enteric nervous system (ENS)-innervating vagal fibers</a>. First, they  injected α-Syn preformed fibrils in the wall of the duodenum of young adult mice. From there, they watched the progression of α-Syn proteins and their effects on the GI system. Next, they used an adeno-associated virus (AAV) to express the <em>GBA1</em> gene (which encodes a lysosomal enzyme called GCase) to determine if it can ameliorate peripheral synucleinopathology. Inoculation of the GI tract led to α-Syn protein accumulation within the brainstem of aged mice, but not younger mice, demonstrating that GCase plays an important role in this process. This work is important because it shows that aging may put an individual at risk for gut to brain protein transmission processes. Overall, understanding how vulnerabilities within the peripheral systems lead to α-Syn accumulation show promise as an early-detection technique for neurodegenerative conditions like PD.</p>

<p><strong>Human Neocortical Neurosolver software helps interpret the origin of human brain imaging techniques</strong>           </p>
<p>Magneto- and electro-encephalography (MEG/EEG) technology provides useful information about the brain. This is exciting because without these forms of technology, it would be harder to understand the brain in living humans. However, it is not well understood how these larger, macroscopic signals relate to the underlying cellular- and circuit-level mechanisms. This limitation hugely constrains the ability of MEG/EEG techniques to reveal novel principles of information processing. Further, it limits our ability to translate MEG/EEG findings into new therapies for disorders of the brain, which are largely due to dysfunctional neural circuits. <a href="https://sites.brown.edu/stephanie-r-jones-lab/">Dr. Stephanie Jones</a><strong><a href="https://www.ninds.nih.gov/exit_disclaimer"><img alt="external link" src="https://brainupdateblog.files.wordpress.com/2015/01/external_link_20x20.png?w=1540" style="height: 10px; width: 10px; background: none !important; border: none !important;" title="This graphic notice means that you are leaving an NINDS website. Click to view our external website policy." /></a></strong> and her team of researchers at Brown University are working to bridge the gap between experimental and computational neuroscience in order to better study human brain dynamics. They are helping to achieve this goal with their <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31967544/">recently published, novel software program called the Human Neocortical Neurosolver (HNN)</a>. This user-friendly program is helping researchers and clinicians interpret the neural circuit origins of MEG/EEG signals. The model is able to simulate electrical activity of cells in the neocortex; then, by feeding real human EEG/MEG data into the model, the researchers can predict patterns of circuit-level activity that may be the neural origins of the EEG/MEG signal data. Essentially, now these MEG/EEG signals are working harder than ever before to tell us more precise information about the brain at the level of the circuit. Moreover, we now have a refined and user-friendly software program that allows us to do this more effectively, and this tool is <a href="https://hnn.brown.edu/">open source and available for installation today</a><strong><a href="https://www.ninds.nih.gov/exit_disclaimer"><img alt="external link" src="https://brainupdateblog.files.wordpress.com/2015/01/external_link_20x20.png?w=1540" style="height: 10px; width: 10px; background: none !important; border: none !important;" title="This graphic notice means that you are leaving an NINDS website.

<p>Open Access Week returned this year, bringing back themes of equity and inclusivity to the forefront of the community once again, as it has done in the past. </p>



<p>This OA week PLOS coordinated and participated in a mix of activities to illustrate the positive impacts Open Access can have on the scientific community and explored strategies to ensure that Open Access truly is open for everyone.<br /><br /><strong>Open Access Week 2020 with the Drexel Libraries</strong><br /><br />On October 20, Emily Chenette, <em>PLOS ONE</em>’s Deputy Editor-in-Chief was a  virtual speaker at Drexel Libraries’, <a href="https://libcal.library.drexel.edu/event/7210114"><em>How Open Access Supports ‘Good Science’</em></a>. In this session, Emily explored questions such as: <em>what comes to mind when you think about good science? Is it reproducible? Impactful? Accessible? </em></p>



<p>The discussion delved into what we mean when we talk about good science, and how Open Access supports the practice and publication of it. She also discussed the steps PLOS takes to ensure that published papers are open and accessible, reproducible, conducted ethically, and contribute to the base of academic knowledge.</p>

<p><br /><strong>Voices and opinions of OA advocates</strong><br /><br />Throughout this year’s OA Week we saw a great number of people stand up and take part in a collection of online activities to share their thoughts in support of Open Access publishing.</p>



<p>One of the great things about OA Week is hearing from the community with their thoughts and opinions on what matters to them most. A lot of those people took part in our daily polls: </p>



<p><a href="https://twitter.com/PLOS/timelines/1319329649332228097"><em>What is the most important reason to publish #OpenAccess?</em></a><em> </em></p>

<p><br />People also <a href="https://twitter.com/PLOS/timelines/1319288985231872006">tweeted</a> their support and promoted the many benefits of OA, from international collaboration to the advantages of Open Data.<br /></p>

<p><br /><strong>Building Equity and Inclusivity in Science</strong><br /><br />This OA Week we took the time to reflect on the importance of research accessibility and the many benefits of Open Access in our blog post, <a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2020/10/building-equity-and-inclusivity-in-science/"><em>Open Access Week 2020: Building Equity and Inclusivity in Science</em></a>. Don’t miss it! </p>



<p>PLOS’ entire ethos is built on the idea of research being open to a global community, however, we know there’s still plenty of work for us to do to make things better for researchers across the world. In this post we highlight the benefits of OA and what PLOS can do to make our journals more inclusive, equitable and diverse for the scientific community as a whole.<br /><br /><a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2020/07/our-commitment-to-diversity-equity-and-inclusion/">Read more on our plans for a more inclusive future.</a><br /><strong><br />What’s next?</strong><br /><strong><br /></strong>We will continue to make PLOS an increasingly more inclusive, transparent and diverse platform for researchers across the globe to showcase their crucial findings. A part of this work has already started as we aim to bridge the gap between researchers and Open Access with the introduction of our <a href="https://plos.org/resources/community-action-publishing/">Community Action Publishing</a> initiative and our <a href="https://plos.org/resources/for-institutions/">institutional partnerships</a>. Together with our latest message on <a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2020/10/plos-and-transparency-including-plan-s-price-service-transparency-framework/">price transparency</a> we hope our latest opportunities and resources will help researchers open their research and trust in science. </p>

From Google's English:  "Society needs humanistic knowledge. The humanities need to reach out to society. Therefore, for the sixth year in a row, the think tank Humtank awards the Humtank Prize to academics or institutions that have made a meritorious contribution to important humanities perspectives in society. This year's winner is the Royal Library, and this is the motivation:

 

The Royal Library (KB) has, by opening up its entire digitized newspaper archive on the internet during the corona pandemic, paved the way into the future. In a time marked by copyright and commercial tunnel events, KB gave everyone the opportunity to explore almost 400 years of Swedish news reporting and history - regardless of where they are in the country. A temporary copyright agreement meant that the entire archive could only be accessed freely for a few months, but through the initiative, the library has opened a wide window, which no researcher or good citizen wants to see closed anymore. In a far-sighted and meritorious way, KB has thus shown a genuinely digitized future, where history is free and accessible for everyone to explore."

In response to this threat, humans react in ways to boost their self-esteem and reinforce their own values (and punish outsiders).

                <h4><a href="https://blog.arxiv.org/2020/10/30/october-2020-highlights/">October 2020 Highlights</a></h4>

<p>The arXiv team has been busy this month! Here’s a recap.</p>
<p>Authors can now submit their work using <a href="https://blog.arxiv.org/2020/09/24/tex-live-2020-release-oct-1-2020/"><strong>TeXLive 2020</strong></a>, the most recent version of the TeX open source markup language that enables precision formatting for academic writing. The rollout was seamless, with zero interruptions in service. TeXLive 2020 — and, psst, an upcoming TeX log error highlighting feature — make submission smoother for authors.</p>
<p><strong><img alt="arXivLabs logo" class="alignright wp-image-682 size-thumbnail" height="150" src="https://blog.arxiv.org/files/2020/09/arxivlabs-icon-150x150.png" width="150" /><a href="https://blog.arxiv.org/2020/09/28/arxivlabs-a-space-for-community-innovation/">arXivLabs</a></strong> – a new framework for collaboration – was launched. Plus, exciting new functionality was released in the arXivLabs tabs section of the abstract record page. Based on user feedback, it’s fabs. Code can now be linked to articles, thanks to the <a href="https://blog.arxiv.org/2020/10/08/new-arxivlabs-feature-provides-instant-access-to-code/">Papers with Code</a> collaboration.  Readers can also now easily check out articles that match their interest when they activate the <a href="https://blog.arxiv.org/2020/10/15/core-recommender-now-supports-article-discovery-on-arxiv/">CORE Recommender</a>. Community collaboration and cutting-edge features are important to authors and readers – which means they’re important to the arXiv team too.</p>
<p>Behind the scenes, a <a href="https://blog.arxiv.org/2020/10/05/new-classifier-adds-transparency-to-arxiv-submission-process/"><strong>new classifier</strong></a> was integrated into the submission system. This helps place papers in the right category, which is critical to helping research reach the right audience. The author experience didn’t change with this upgrade, but – bonus! – this classifier code is totally transparent and publicly available so that others can build up on it.</p>

This event also kicked off <a href="https://blog.arxiv.org/2020/10/19/giving-week-why-arxiv/">Giving Week</a>, arXiv’s first community fundraiser since the pandemic began. We were heartened to receive nearly 1400 individual donations, ranging from $5 to $1000. Each and every gift helps ensure that arXiv remains a non-commercial, community resource. <strong>Thank you!</strong></p>
<p>Last, and certainly not least, arXiv hosted its very first <strong>virtual board meeting</strong>, where members of the <a href="https://arxiv.org/about/people/scientific_ad_board">Scientific Advisory Board</a> and <a href="https://arxiv.org/about/people/member_ad_board">Member Advisory Board</a> gathered to hear about updates, plans, challenges and opportunities — and provide their valuable insights. The meeting was intense and fruitful, with discussions ranging from big picture strategy to daily operations like moderator recruitment. Some of our board members have volunteered in this capacity for more than a decade, and we’re grateful that they continually inspire the staff to serve authors, readers, and open science. <strong>Thank you!</strong></p>

                <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/~r/plos/Blog/~3/xcSDQxO7WxU/">PLOS Update</a></h4>

<p>Over four years ago we launched PLOS Channels to highlight research and news relevant to our research communities. Eventually, the portfolio grew to include 13 Channels in topics from stem cells to tuberculosis to cholera (see the full list below). New content was added to Channels by expert Channel Editors, who selected articles to include in a journal- and publisher-agnostic manner. Channels were initially conceived as a meaningful space to serve a variety of communities beyond typical journal boundaries and challenge the assessment of impact and importance of research.  </p>



<p>Today, we are announcing that we have made the difficult decision to stop updating the Channels. Despite positive feedback from some authors and their institutions, we have not seen the usage from the community that would allow us to achieve our goals. Moreover, we were not able to scale the program to meet everyone’s needs, and we suspect that post-publication curation of content may be best done by a neutral third party, rather than an organisation like PLOS, which publishes some of the content included in the Channels. </p>



<p>The content in all Channels will be archived and will remain available online. The following two Channels will migrate to PLOS Curated Collections, where they will continue to be updated with relevant research from PLOS to connect people to content and inspire collaboration:</p>



<p>–      <a href="https://channels.plos.org/vdrrc">  Veterans Disability &amp; Rehabilitation Research</a>: to maintain our commitment to the Veteran’s Administration</p>



<p>–      <a href="https://channels.plos.org/dfs">  Disease Forecasting &amp; Surveillance</a>: because the current pandemic demonstrates the essential nature of this content, and its curation. This Channel will be renamed to Infectious Disease Epidemiology to ensure that all relevant content on this important topic is included.</p>



<p>PLOS would not exist without the people who believe in our mission and values, and who help us with  projects like Channels. We rely on scientists like our Channel Editors to keep pushing us on our collective journey to make science more open, accessible and transparent.</p>



<p>On behalf of everyone at PLOS, we want to thank all our Channel Editors and Administrators (past &amp; present) for their tireless work and dedication and all of the loyal subscribers who have followed PLOS Channels over the years. Thank you! Thank you! Thank you! You have truly enriched our organization and science as a whole.</p>

                <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/~r/plos/Blog/~3/Kucfd8ARAo8/">How do researchers evaluate research?</a></h4>

<p>PLOS has received a grant from the <a href="https://sloan.org/">Alfred</a><a href="https://sloan.org/"> P. Sloan Foundation</a> to study how researchers evaluate both the <strong>credibility </strong>and <strong>impact </strong>of research outputs (e.g. articles, preprints, data, and code). We will be conducting this research in partnership with the <a href="https://www.ascb.org/">American Society for Cell Biology</a><strong> </strong>(ASCB).</p>



<p>We’ll be looking at this in two contexts: (1) when researchers are <em>discovering </em>and <em>reading </em>these outputs in the process of their own research, and (2) when they are <em>assessing </em>these outputs while participating in grant application review panels and hiring committees.</p>



<p>We are interested in characterizing the steps that researchers go through to form judgments of both credibility and impact in these two contexts.</p>



<h3>Why is this new research needed?</h3>



<p>Previous research has explored the factors that influence trust and how researchers decide which articles to read and cite, showing that <a href="https://doi.org/10.3233/ISU-140725">personal inspection</a>, social clues, and <a href="https://doi.org/10.1087/20140206">peer review</a>, are important. Recently, preprints have created new challenges for researchers who evaluate large amounts of new information outside of the traditional framework of journal peer review. A <a href="https://doi.org/10.31222/osf.io/kabux">survey by the Center for Open Science</a> suggested that cues related to Open Science content (e.g. signaling open availability of data) and independent verification are important for judging credibility of preprints.</p>



<p>Yet, the current system for assessing research is <a href="https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0228914">dominated by signifiers of </a><a href="https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0228914"><strong>impact</strong></a><strong>. </strong>Since impact cannot be known until after time has passed, various proxies have been used that signal perceived, or the potential for, impact such as publication in a high Impact Factor journal.</p>



<p>PLOS and other organizations, in particular the multi-stakeholder organization <a href="https://sfdora.org/">DORA, </a>have stressed the negative consequences of such a narrow focus on proxies of impact and the need for reform. Most problematically, researchers are pushed to place a higher priority on pursuing these proxies than on making their research <strong>credible</strong>, <strong>reproducible, </strong>and <strong>reusable.</strong></p>



<p>Many have suggested that this focus on proxies for impact in research assessment is at least in part due to the <strong>practical limitations in evaluating credibility and impact</strong>. By understanding what truly matters to researchers in forming these judgments, we hope to find insights that can inform better practice in research assessment, inspire better tools for researchers, and help us evolve how we signal the markers of credibility in the articles we publish.</p>



<h3>Collaboration with ASCB</h3>



<p>We are not undertaking this project alone! We are excited to be conducting this research in collaboration with the ASCB. This partnership helps maximize the connection of this project to the research community. As the organizational sponsor of DORA, ASCB is also a scientific association demonstrably dedicated to advocating sound research policies and improving research culture.</p>



<h3>What comes after the research?</h3>



<p>We will publish a report on the insights obtained through this research. This report will have a CC BY license, with anonymized and aggregated data.</p>



<p>Future research might include a quantitative initiative to validate the findings with a broader group of researchers. Ultimately, we would like to understand if there are opportunities to better serve researchers’ needs to assess and discover new research than currently available methods. Therefore, we also hope that our initial report will prompt further research by others, which we believe is important for the research and scholarly communication communities. We are very thankful to the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation for their interest in this research project and dedicated support of <a href="https://sloan.org/programs/digital-technology/scholarly-communication">Scholarly Communication</a> issues in general.</p>



<p>We are confident that improvements to research assessment culture and practice are possible. And we also believe that there is no more important a moment to be doing this, as we experience a global crisis during which unbiased, rigorous, and credible research will play an unprecedented role.</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">History was made this year when two women, Jennifer Doudna and Emmanuelle Charpentier, won the Nobel Prize in Chemistry for the development of a genome editing method using CRISPR-Cas9, which has numerous applications in the editing of plant and animal genomes. However, even before the discovery of CRISPR-Cas’ use in DNA editing, the use of genome editing techniques in humans has long been considered unethical, with many countries making it illegal to edit human embryos. In 2018, the highly-controversial birth of the <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-07545-0?utm_source=bmc_blogs&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=null&amp;utm_campaign=blog_2020_bmcseriesblog">‘CRISPR babies’</a> – twin girls allegedly born with CRISPR-edited genomes – shocked the world and renewed discussions about the ethics and legality of such practices.</p>
<p>Using cystic fibrosis scenarios as functional examples, Schleidgen <em>et al. </em>explore three consistently-debated issues of human germline therapies in relation to CRISPR-Cas: the risks of using the tool in human germline editing, what responsibilities future generations bear and whether the treatment is legitimate.</p>
<p>The authors argue that categorically prohibiting the use of CRISPR-Cas ‘one-generation germline therapies’ – which would theoretically phenotypically cure the developing embryo, but ensure that the changes are not passed onto offspring – would not be legally or ethically justifiable, provided that concepts surrounding human germline editing are clarified.</p>

<p>There are currently no unified guidelines to help individual healthcare professionals (and medical students) assess bias across different study types, an essential skill in the practice of evidence-based medicine. Study type-specific tools do currently exist, such as those that aid in the assessment of bias in observational studies, but can’t be reliably applied to other study types, such as randomized trials.</p>
<p>Luijendijk <em>et al.</em> have identified this gap and also argue that current frameworks are limited in requiring only methodological knowledge to detect bias, as some study aspects may only be appraised using subject-matter knowledge. In order to generate a unified framework, they applied a popular conceptual framework typically used only in observational studies to randomized trials, by defining the research question in terms of study population, intervention and outcome, and using causal diagrams to illustrate how each source of bias can lead to over- or under-estimations of treatment effects. The developed framework allows for the identification of three sources of bias independent of study design: bias due to a common cause, bias due to systematic measurement error, and bias due to a common effect.</p>

<p>The human gut is colonized by many commensal and pathogenic bacteria, which constitute part of the gut microbiome. Since it was established that the composition of the human gut microbiome can have major impacts on our health, the field of research has rapidly grown; in the last 40 years,<a href="https://gut.bmj.com/content/67/9/1716?utm_source=bmc_blogs&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=null&amp;utm_campaign=blog_2020_bmcseriesblog"> 80% of human gut microbiome research was published between 2013 and 2017.</a> <em>Bifidobacteria</em> are relatively abundant in the human gut, and attract particular interest due to their potential for use as probiotics (live bacteria that are considered to be good for health) and as targets of prebiotics (substances that increase the abundance or activity of existing bacteria).</p>
<p>In their study, Chung <em>et al.</em> investigated the effect of dietary supplementation of AXOS (arabinoxylan oligosaccharides, which have been demonstrated to promote the abundance of <em>Bifidobacteria</em>) on gut microbiota. They carried out a crossover, randomised, double-blind trial whereby the diets of elderly volunteers were supplemented with AXOS or maltodextrin, and their effects on faecal bacteria and blood serum parameters were measured.</p>
<p>The faecal samples analysed revealed an increase in <em>Bifidobacteria </em>observed across the entire cohort in response to AXOS supplementation, independent of the observed inter-individual variation in gut microbiota. However, variation in the levels of baseline <em>Prevotella</em> species of gut bacteria did determine how responsive each patient was to AXOS supplementation. The authors conclude that AXOS supplementation is bifidogenic, suggesting that AXOS may be considered a viable prebiotic option in the elderly, and due to the influence of existing gut bacteria on the bifidogenic response, call for the consideration of microbiota profiling when testing the efficacy of prebiotics.</p>

<p>Conventional cigarette smoking during pregnancy is linked to adverse effects on both mother and baby health, and is amongst one of the leading preventable causes of adverse birth outcomes. The difficulties of quitting smoking during pregnancy have led many to consider alternatives to conventional cigarettes, such as electronic or ‘e’ cigarettes. As they contain fewer toxic chemicals than conventional cigarettes, e-cigarettes are largely believed to have fewer adverse health effects compared to traditional cigarettes, but there is little evidence to support this.</p>
<p>Authors Sooyong Kim and Sanda Cristina Oancea sought to determine whether e-cigarettes are safer in pregnancy than conventional cigarettes, by extracting and analysing data from the PRAMS (Pregnancy Risk Assessment Monitoring System) study cohort, a large study that included data on 55,000 pregnancies. Participants were classified into three groups: complete tobacco abstinence, exclusive conventional cigarette use, and exclusive e-cigarette use, and adverse birth outcomes were defined as low birth weight, preterm birth and ‘small for gestational age’. They found that, when compared to conventional cigarette users, the risk of each adverse birth outcome was not significantly reduced, and e-cigarettes cannot be considered to be safer than conventional cigarettes. Following this, the authors encourage the complete abstinence from all tobacco products during pregnancy.</p>

<p>Dr. Luca Morgantini worked with a diverse group of researchers to survey healthcare professionals across the globe to study the degree of burnout they were experiencing. For their <em>PLOS ONE</em> article, <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0238217">Factors contributing to healthcare professional burnout during the COVID-19 pandemic: A rapid turnaround global survey</a>, they surveyed 2,700 individuals across 60 countries in April 2020 and found that burnout had generally increased compared to pre-pandemic times. I asked Luca on whether there were any surprises he came across during this study, the scientific communities’ response to the crisis and more. </p>



<p><strong><em>This paper seems outside the scope of your usual work. How did you get involved in this study and why do you believe this research is important?</em></strong></p>



<p>LM: I decided to document the mental health burden of the COVID-19 pandemic on healthcare workers the moment I saw non-medical parts of our society downplay what was happening in March, when the SARS-CoV-2 virus was starting to spread in Europe and North America. This research is important because we gathered data during the height of the pandemic, providing solid foundations for future healthcare policies while avoiding recall biases.</p>



<p>It was evident from the reports of my Chinese friends and colleagues how serious was this disease, with Wuhan going on lockdown in late January. I observed how the infection slowly spread to the rest of the world hitting Italy, my home country, particularly hard. I completed my medical training in Milan, where my colleagues found themselves working in the red zone without adequate protection or directives from their supervisors. Soon the pandemic reached the United States, where I am currently living. While study is outside my usual scope of work, as a healthcare professional and researcher I felt the need to play my part in the fight against COVID-19.</p>



<p><strong><em>I note that you originally uploaded the manuscript to MedRxiv as a preprint. At what time in your career did you start thinking about Open Science, and why is it important to you?</em></strong></p>



<p>LM: I believe that Open Science is essential for a fair and accessible future of science. Paywalls and other accessibility restrictions disproportionally affect early-career investigators or individuals with less economic means. I have been personally impacted by these paywalls, as institutions often cannot offer a subscription to all the countless scientific publishers. I understand there is a delicate balance between accessibility and profit, but I am convinced that other business models are feasible.</p>



<p>My team chose to publish a preprint on MedRxiv and then published our article on <em>PLOS ONE</em>, because one of the purposes of our research is to make all our collected data freely available for other researchers.</p>



<p><strong><em>You additionally opted to publish your peer review history with your publication. What led you to this decision and how important do you think transparency of the review process is?</em></strong></p>



<p>LM: We decided to publish the peer review history for two reasons. First, we believe this is a way to recognize the tremendous work done by the Editor and the Reviewers. They significantly contributed to the relevance of our manuscript by providing constructive comments, and we want to acknowledge their role in our publication by making their comments public.</p>



<p>Second, we believe in the importance of a transparent review process. This will allow other researchers investigating this field to understand what the concerns of the reviewers were.</p>



<p><strong><em>Do you consider this research interdisciplinary? If so, how crucial are structures that support interdisciplinary review to the publication and dissemination of this type of research?</em></strong></p>



<p>LM: Burnout is a complex phenomenon and an interdisciplinary approach allowed our team to evaluate it from different perspectives. My co-authors have different backgrounds in urology, psychiatry, biostatistics and epidemiology research. The heterogeneity of our team was essential in creating a short but comprehensive questionnaire.</p>



<p>An interdisciplinary team of reviewers is important for the same reasons. Analyzing such complex arguments from different points of view is required to better assess the eventual limitations of each study.</p>



<p><strong><em>Were you particularly surprised by anything your study uncovered or were the results generally what you expected?</em></strong></p>



<p>LM: To be honest, we were simply amazed by the number of healthcare professionals that participated in our study. I feel that they appreciated our process because we were as inclusive as possible, considering parts of the healthcare workforce and geographical areas that are often overlooked in healthcare research. From the comments we received, we noticed how they appreciated our effort to study their quality of work and life, and their willingness to make their COVID-19 experiences count.</p>



<p>One of the most surprising results was the selflessness and dedication of healthcare workers: the vast majority is willing to continue working despite the obvious risk. Their main concern is not infecting themselves, but bringing the virus home to friends and loved ones. These results were consistent across all countries, genders, and healthcare professions.</p>



<p><strong><em>In your Conclusion, you mention a few actions that could potentially mitigate burnout for healthcare professionals. Are there any that you would particularly like to see pursued by institutions and other stakeholders?</em></strong></p>



<p>LM: It is evident how our society and healthcare systems were not ready to withstand the first wave of a global pandemic. When the Spanish flu infected an estimated half a billion individuals around a century ago, the scientific community was only starting to understand what viruses are and how pandemics evolve. COVID-19 is the first true global pandemic where modern science can play an active and aware role. This is an unprecedented opportunity for researchers to document and understand how to improve the condition of frontline healthcare workers. The manuscript we published represents only one of the hundreds of studies that are being conducted on this topic that all together will contribute to mitigating the negative effects of future pandemics.</p>



<p>In particular, we observed how training was mostly reported to be ineffective and how adequate protective equipment was rarely available. We understood how healthcare workers are more concerned about their families than themselves, and future policies that would assure the safety of their loved ones, such as periodical testing, kindergartens, or short term rentals close to hospitals, would greatly improve their quality of life.</p>



<p><strong><em>What have you seen from peers and the scientific community as a whole during the COVID-19 pandemic?</em></strong></p>



<p>LM: Because of the COVID-19 pandemic, the scientific community is performing an extraordinary and unprecedented synergic effort towards improving diagnosis, treatment, and vaccination against SARS-CoV-2. I felt this willingness to help and collaborate while conducting this research, where I received tremendous support from my institution, colleagues, and expert researchers. The lessons learned during these difficult times will greatly help our scientific community and will help build a collaborative and constructive future. I am grateful to be part of this collective scientific effort that is one of the positive lessons to be learnt from this pandemic.</p>



<h4>Comments from the Editor</h4>



<p><em>Dr. Michio Murakami, PLOS ONE Academic Editor from the Fukushima Medical University School of Medicine, speaks on the significance of Luca’s work and the need to work through differences to improve our world. </em></p>



<p>MM: Among the many published COVID-19-related papers, the paper by Morgantini et al. is particularly significant. First, they conducted a rapid survey of 60 countries, highlighting that burnout of healthcare professionals is an important issue around the world. Second, it points out the importance of training and organizational support as a solution to address burnout. Ultimately, the paper points out an issue that is shared globally and presents findings that can lead to solutions.</p>



<p>COVID-19 and the associated social response pose a diverse range of physical and socio-psychological health problems. Some of these issues relate to discrimination, prejudice and social division. Different values and cultural worldviews, depending on the identity and position of individuals and groups, may lead to different opinions and social division. We need to be respectful of our values to individuals and different groups, and increase awareness of the fact that society is built on mutual reciprocity. There are shared goals and a vision of the world we can aspire to, even though our values may differ.</p>



<p>Needless to say, there are many aspects of our health that is supported by healthcare professionals, and none of us want a world in which many healthcare professionals leave their work. This paper by Morgantini et al. provides useful insights on this global issues that should be addressed and encourages further discussion about the vision of the world we aspire to.</p>



<p><em>I extend my gratitude to both Luca and Michio for providing their thoughtful comments and for their hard work as researchers. </em></p>

<p class="">The auditory cortex is found in the <a href="https://www.neuroscientificallychallenged.com/glossary/temporal-lobe" target="_blank">temporal lobe</a>. Most of it is hidden from view, buried deep within a fissure called the <a href="https://www.neuroscientificallychallenged.com/glossary/lateral-sulcus" target="_blank">lateral sulcus</a>. Some auditory cortex is visible on the external surface the brain, however, as it extends to a <a href="https://www.neuroscientificallychallenged.com/glossary/gyrus" target="_blank">gyrus</a> called the <a href="https://www.neuroscientificallychallenged.com/glossary/superior-temporal-gyrus" target="_blank">superior temporal gyrus</a>.</p><p class="">The auditory cortex can be subdivided into multiple regions, although there is still some question about the most appropriate way to create those subdivisions in the human brain. There is general agreement, however, that the auditory cortex consists of a primary area—which is often referred to as the <em>core</em> region—as well as multiple non-primary areas.</p><p class="">The primary auditory cortex in humans is hidden within the lateral sulcus on a collection of gyri known as <a href="https://www.neuroscientificallychallenged.com/glossary/heschls-gyri" target="_blank">Heschl’s gyri</a> (aka the <a href="https://www.neuroscientificallychallenged.com/glossary/transverse-temporal-gyri" target="_blank">transverse temporal gyri</a>). The precise location of the primary region in humans is variable, however, as is the arrangement of Heschl’s gyri (some people have one of these gyri, while others have two or three). For example, in some individuals the primary auditory cortex seems to occupy one Heschl’s gyrus, while in others it may extend past that gyrus into a neighboring <a href="https://www.neuroscientificallychallenged.com/glossary/sulcus" target="_blank">sulcus</a> (or beyond).</p><p class="">The region adjacent to the core is often referred to as the <em>belt</em> region, and surrounding that is an area often called the <em>parabelt </em>region. These neighboring areas are mostly buried within the lateral sulcus as well, but may extend out to the superior temporal gyrus. The demarcations of the auditory cortex in general, however, are imprecise.</p><p class="" data-rte-preserve-empty="true"></p><h2>What is the auditory cortex and what does it do?</h2><p class="">The auditory cortex plays a critical role in our ability to perceive sound. It is thought to be integral to our perception of the fundamental aspects of an auditory stimulus, like the pitch of the sound. But it is also important in various other aspects of sound processing, like determining where in space a sound originates from as well as identifying what might be producing the sound. The auditory cortex is also thought to be involved in higher-level auditory processing, such as recognizing aspects of sound that are specific to speech. Damage to the auditory cortex can disrupt various facets of auditory perception. For example, damage (e.g., like that caused by a stroke) might cause deficits in the ability to detect changes in pitch, localize sounds in space, or understand speech.</p><p class="">The auditory cortex primarily receives auditory information from a nucleus in the <a href="https://www.neuroscientificallychallenged.com/glossary/thalamus" target="_blank">thalamus</a> called the <a href="https://www.neuroscientificallychallenged.com/glossary/medial-geniculate-nucleus" target="_blank">medial geniculate nucleus</a>, which is where all incoming information about hearing is sent before it is processed by the <a href="https://www.neuroscientificallychallenged.com/glossary/cerebral-cortex" target="_blank">cerebral cortex</a>. Cells in the primary region of the auditory cortex  (and in some parts of the non-primary regions as well) are arranged so they form what is known as a <em>tonotopic</em> map. What this means is that different areas of the auditory cortex are involved in processing different sound frequencies. (<em>Frequency</em>, when referring to sound waves, is related to <em>pitch</em>. High frequency sound waves lead to high-pitched sounds.) </p><p class="">The tonotopic arrangement of the primary auditory cortex is similar to what is seen in the <a href="https://www.neuroscientificallychallenged.com/glossary/cochlea" target="_blank">cochlea</a>, where sound processing begins. Thus, it can be said that the core of the auditory cortex contains a map of the cochlea, with each point in the cochlea corresponding to a strip of cells in the auditory cortex. This type of arrangement is similar to what is seen in other sensory cortices (e.g., the <a href="https://www.neuroscientificallychallenged.com/glossary/primary-somatosensory-cortex" target="_blank">primary somatosensory cortex</a> contains a map of the sensory receptors of the body).</p><p class="">There are thought to be other patterns of functional organization of the primary auditory cortex as well, although the importance of these patterns in hearing is still poorly understood. For example, there seem to be cells (EI cells) in the auditory cortex that are activated only by stimuli coming from one ear; they are inhibited by stimuli coming from the other ear. Other cells (EE cells) are activated by information coming from both ears.</p><p class="">Sensory processing in the areas surrounding the primary auditory cortex is also not well understood, but it is thought that cells in the belt and parabelt are involved in higher-level processing of complex sounds. For example, research suggests these non-primary areas of the auditory cortex may be important in recognizing species-specific vocalizations, which implies they play a role in processing speech in humans. Studies have also found the non-primary auditory regions to be involved in distinct aspects of speech perception, like detecting the beginning and end of syllables, attending to one voice while ignoring another, and processing sounds in a logical temporal order.</p><p class="">Overall, there is still much to be learned about the fine details of auditory processing in the auditory cortex. It is clear, however, that this part of the brain plays a critical role in creating the rich sensory experience of hearing.</p><p class="" data-rte-preserve-empty="true"></p><h3>References (in addition to linked text above):</h3><p class="">Amunts K, Morosan P, Hilbig H, Zilles K.

<div class="field field--name-body field--type-text-with-summary field--label-hidden field__items">
<div class="field__item">
<p>Eleonora Presani’s first day as executive director of <a href="https://arxiv.org/">arXiv</a> was March 16, 2020 – the same day much of New York state went into lockdown.</p>
<p>Although she was new to arXiv, the free and open scientific research database maintained and operated by Cornell, she realized immediately that some things would have to change.</p>
<p>“Basically out of nowhere, we started to see more than 100 [coronavirus-related] papers per week,” Presani said during an Oct. 19 panel, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHfuvUxmHx4&amp;feature=youtu.be">“Rapid Response: How arXiv and Other Open-Access Resources Are Adapting to Research Community Needs During the Pandemic.”</a></p>
<p>“We had to do something about it,” she said, “to make sure we could process them at the same service level we provide for our other papers.”</p>
<p>The mission of arXiv is to make scholarly research that has not yet been published freely available to researchers around the world. When COVID-19 struck, this mission became even more urgent, as scientists raced to learn more about the coronavirus and develop ways to control the pandemic. But it also highlighted the challenges faced by preprint servers, including arXiv, bioRxiv and medRxiv, in providing easy access to a huge volume of research that has not yet been peer-reviewed while minimizing the spread of potential misinformation.</p>
<figure class="wp-caption alignleft" id="attachment_749" style="width: 270px;"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHfuvUxmHx4&amp;t"><img alt="image of arXiv Video Screenshot" class="wp-image-749 size-full" height="182" src="https://blog.arxiv.org/files/2020/10/Screen-Shot-2020-10-22-at-9.49.53-AM.png" width="270" /></a>To watch the panel discussion in its entirety, view it here.</figure>
<p>With nearly 1.8 million articles in its collection, arXiv relies on a team of 185 volunteer moderators, supported by a small team of staff, to screen submitted papers. But since the majority of its content is in the fields of physics, mathematics and computer science, the organization needed to quickly escalate its expertise in COVID-related research.</p>
<p>In addition to creating a new searchable category for coronavirus articles, arXiv hired a Cornell postdoctoral researcher in biomedicine to help screen these articles for potentially misleading content. arXiv also has partnered with other organizations compiling open-access research, in order to make these articles more easily accessible and to speed the pace of discovery worldwide.</p>
<p>At bioRxiv and medRxiv – which saw huge spikes in submissions as COVID-19 spread – moderators soon realized they needed enhanced measures to combat the risk of harmful misinformation. When a paper posted in January claiming that inserts in coronavirus’ spike protein resembled protein sequences from HIV, technical issues with the paper provoked a storm of criticism that led to its withdrawal, said John Inglis, co-founder of bioRxiv and medRxiv, during the panel.</p>
<p>“But we also noticed during that weekend that the paper had been picked up by conspiracy-oriented websites who were discussing the possibility that the virus had been human-engineered,” Inglis said. “We decided to put up an additional caveat about the use of preprints – a large yellow banner that reminded readers that these were preprints and, among other things, they should not be reported in the U.S. media as established information.”</p>
<p>The sites, hosted by the Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, also put in place additional screening practices, including two-step scrutiny of every paper. The screeners are looking for issues such as plagiarism and assertions that could harm the public if they turn out to be wrong, Inglis said.</p>
<p>“Part of this was an awareness of the fact that in all the furor about hydroxychloroquine, for example, the run on the drug was such that patients who really needed hydroxychloroquine were denied access to it,” he said. “We were very conscious of not wanting to add to that problem, or create another similar problem.”</p>
<p>Papers from arXiv, bioRxiv and medRxiv are among those included in CORD-19 (COVID-19 Open Research Dataset), a new dataset made available to leverage artificial intelligence to make a vast trove of coronavirus-related research more easily searchable.</p>
<p>“We wanted to take all the research about COVID-19 and coronavirus, going back all the way to the 1960s and 1970s when initial research about coronavirus started getting published, and make that available in a machine readable format,” said panelist Sebastian Kohlmeier, CORD-19 project manager and senior manager at Semantic Scholar, Allen Institute for Artificial Intelligence, which created CORD-19 in partnership with other research groups.</p>
<p>When CORD-19 started in March, it contained 29,000 papers. It now has more than 280,000.</p>
<p>“It’s been absolutely incredible,” Kohlmeier said. “And one of the great driving forces behind making all the content available was a lot of the scientific publishers and preprint servers banded together to make COVID-19-related research open access, which was a very important component to making this research available to scientists who wanted to analyze the entire universe of coronavirus-related research.”</p>

<p>NeuroNex brings together researchers working across disciplines into a coherent network to develop innovative, accessible, and shared technologies and approaches, as well as theoretical frameworks and computational modeling to advance understanding of brain function across organizational levels and a diversity of species. We’re building a foundation for the next generation of research into the brain. The theme of the 2020 NeuroNex meeting is Dimensions of Team Science Diversity. Diversity is critical to creative problem solving and innovation, and the success of team science depends on recognizing and removing barriers to creating richly diverse teams. Scientists can be diverse in many ways, from gender, race, sexual orientation, and cultural background to experimental approach and choice of model organism. NeuroNex3 will include keynote speakers and panel discussions with presentations and posters by NeuroNex investigators and trainees. There will also be plenty of opportunity to network and exchange ideas and insights. <span class="TrackChangeTextInsertion TrackedChange SCXW80441800 BCX9"><span class="TextRun SCXW80441800 BCX9" xml:lang="EN-US"><span class="NormalTextRun SCXW80441800 BCX9">This meeting is funded by the </span></span></span><span class="TrackChangeTextInsertion TrackedChange SCXW80441800 BCX9"><span class="TextRun SCXW80441800 BCX9" xml:lang="EN-US"><span class="NormalTextRun CommentStart SCXW80441800 BCX9"><a href="https://nsf.gov/">National Science Foundation<strong></strong></a><strong><a href="https://www.ninds.nih.gov/exit_disclaimer"><img alt="external link" src="https://brainupdateblog.files.wordpress.com/2015/01/external_link_20x20.png?w=1540" style="height: 10px; width: 10px; background: none !important; border: none !important;" title="This graphic notice means that you are leaving an NINDS website.

Dr. Harvey seeks to understand how the mammalian brain performs computations that underlie cognitive functions, such as decision-making and short-term memory. He helped develop novel methods to measure, manipulate, and analyze neural circuits across spatial and temporal scales, including virtual reality, optical imaging, optogenetics, intracellular electrophysiology, molecular sensors, and computational modeling. Dr. Harvey’s <a href="https://projectreporter.nih.gov/project_info_description.cfm?icde=0&amp;aid=10011969">award</a> may uncover the causal mechanisms by which cognition emerges from basic neurobiological processes, transforming our understanding of mental health and its disorders. His BRAIN Initiative grant focuses on <a href="https://projectreporter.nih.gov/project_info_description.cfm?aid=9610012">combining neural population imaging, connectomics, and computational modeling to study the relationship between neural circuit connectivity and function</a>.</p>

<img alt="" class="attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image" height="110" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2020/10/people-3755342_640-140x110.jpg" style="display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;" width="140" /><p><strong>Contact tracing for disease control</strong></p>
<p>Syphilis and gonorrhea incidence <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchhstp/newsroom/2019/2018-STD-surveillance-report.html">have increased enormously</a> in recent decades, necessitating innovative approaches. The rising prevalence of syphilis and gonorrhea, together with the increase in prevalence of resistant gonorrhea, makes contact tracing an important tool for disease control. In connection with the opioid epidemic, syphilis is now common in rural areas. However, people infected with stigmatized diseases such as syphilis and gonorrhea may be reluctant to reveal all of their sexual contacts. Reasons for not revealing all contacts may include internalized stigma, cognitive dissonance, or beliefs that certain types of sexual contacts do not “count.”</p>
<p>Asking for friends might identify more sexually transmitted infection (STI) cases because friends may participate within the same sexual network, or some friends might be non-romantic sexual partners. One survey even found 77% of Grindr users report looking for friendship, more than the percentage seeking dating (67%), one-on-one sex (62%), or group sex (17%).<a href="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/feed/#_edn1" name="_ednref1">[i]</a></p>
<p><a href="https://bmcpublichealth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12889-020-09589-2?utm_source=bmc_blogs&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=null&amp;utm_campaign=blog_2020_bmcseriesblog"><strong>Our study</strong></a></p>
<p>Patients who were diagnosed with syphilis and gonorrhea in Baltimore City STI clinics were asked to name the most important people in their lives, with questions such as whom they eat meals with, who would take them to medical appointments, who would go to the store for them, or lend them $25. After patients named their friends and social contacts, they were asked to name their sexual contacts. Both social and sexual contacts were invited to the STI clinic for testing, and to name their own social and sexual contacts.</p>
<p>Using this information for patients whose contacts visited the STI clinic, we created a network showing the friendship and sexual contacts and the STI test results.  We identified new cases of both syphilis and gonorrhea within each network.</p>
<figure class="wp-caption alignright" id="attachment_12132" style="width: 307px;"><img alt="" class="wp-image-12132 size-medium" height="300" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2020/10/Figure-1-297x300.jpg" width="297" /><div class="attachment-image--caption">Figure 1</div><div class="attachment-image--source">New cases of syphilis</div></figure>
<p>In Figure 1, the network shows new cases of syphilis identified by asking for social contacts in the large red squares.The small squares are males, and circles are females. Shapes colored red are the participants who tested positive for syphilis. The green arrows are social network connections and the black are sexual network connections. Biological strain analysis for the organism that causes syphilis (<em>T. pallidum</em>) found that the disease strains matched across connected individuals, suggesting that individuals were connected within the same sexual network, although not necessarily directly: the friends may have had sex together or have a sex partner in common that does not appear in the graph. It’s remarkable here that for many pairs where both were infected with syphilis (syphilis-concordant dyads, for short), no sexual partners appear in the graph, and in a few cases both are male.</p>
<figure class="wp-caption alignleft" id="attachment_12133" style="width: 310px;"><img alt="" class="size-medium wp-image-12133" height="297" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2020/10/Figure-2-300x297.jpg" width="300" /><div class="attachment-image--caption">Figure 2</div><div class="attachment-image--source">New cases of gonorrhea</div></figure>
<p>We did the same for gonorrhea.  As before, new cases of gonorrhea identified by asking for social contacts are the large red squares. The small squares are males, and circles are females. Shapes colored red are the participants who tested positive for gonorrhea. The green arrows are social network connections and the black are sexual network connections.</p>
<p>The additional cases of syphilis and gonorrhea identified by asking friendship ties suggest that they under-reported their sexual contacts. These friendship ties may actually be sexual ties that were not reported as sexual; many of these ties were same-sex, and same-sex ties were stigmatized in this community, especially at the time that the data were collected (2001-05). Alternatively, these friendship ties may represent participation in the same sexual networks, such as engaging in a sexual relationship with the same person or people, who were not observed in the data.</p>
<p><strong>Learning from COVID-19</strong></p>
<p>Given existing strains on public health resources, public health policy must be creative. Traditionally, contact tracing is done by Disease Intervention Specialists. However, the 2008 recession resulted in large cuts to public health agencies that were never reversed. The Disease Intervention Specialists currently do not have enough resources even to contact all sexual contacts of index cases of syphilis and gonorrhea, so they prioritize vulnerable populations, such as pregnant women. Public health agencies simply do not have resources to contact the friends of index cases, and index cases may not cooperate anyhow.</p>
<p>However, large technology companies have created privacy-preserving innovations in SARS-coronavirus-2 contact tracing <a href="https://covid19.apple.com/contacttracing">protocols</a> that have been deployed in state health department contact tracing apps. These contact tracing protocols identify nearby phones using Bluetooth and approximate the distance and duration. Public health authorities create COVID-19 contact tracing apps using these protocols that can specify distance and time duration for potential coronavirus contacts. These protocols or health department apps could be extended to contact tracing for other diseases. Changing the parameters for distance and duration on public health contact tracing apps could identify potential sexual contacts, allowing these apps to be used for STI contact tracing. The transition to these COVID-19 contact tracing apps has been <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/why-contact-tracing-apps-not-slowed-covid-us/">bumpy</a>, with technological limitations, <a href="https://hbr.org/2020/07/how-to-get-people-to-actually-use-contact-tracing-apps">low uptake</a>, and <a href="https://devops.com/more-than-half-of-americans-willing-to-participate-in-contact-tracing-but-have-major-privacy-concerns/">lack of public trust</a>, especially in government. The Bluetooth distance detection doesn’t do well <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/biomedical/devices/contact-tracing-apps-struggle-to-be-both-effective-and-private">near shiny surfaces or in public transit buses or trains</a>, and while that’s a large problem for COVID-19 contact tracing, it’s not a problem for STIs. As with many US problems, low public trust in government is the limiting factor for contact tracing, whether traditional or by app.</p>

<h3><strong>Summary</strong></h3>



<p>As a non-profit, mission-driven organization PLOS abides by our commitment to transparency. We <a href="https://plos.org/financial-overview/">openly share</a> information and context about our finances, including <a href="https://plos.org/resources/community-action-publishing/">target revenue amounts</a> in some of our emerging business models. The <a href="https://www.coalition-s.org/price-and-service-transparency-frameworks/">Plan S Price &amp; Service Transparency Framework</a> provided us — and other publishers — a clear, uniform structure to share information about the services we perform and a percentage breakdown of how these are covered by the prices we charge. Many of our mission-driven publishing activities go well beyond peer review and production services. We provide commentary on some of these services, including how the varied editorial setups of our journals contribute to different percentage price breakdowns per title. We encourage other publishers to be transparent and openly share their data via such frameworks. And, we remain confident in showcasing how our prices cover our reasonable costs for a high level of service, with some margin for reinvestment.</p>



<h3><strong>Full Post</strong></h3>



<p>Since our founding in 2001, PLOS has maintained a firm commitment to transparency. Transparency informs our work within communities. It drives our approach to open science practices &amp; policies. And it underpins our willingness to share financial data. Here are three examples of our commitment in action:</p>



<ol><li>Every year we provide financial transparency via the publication and contextualization of our IRS filings (<a href="https://plos.org/financial-overview/">2018 financial overview available here; </a>our 2019 overview will be available in November)</li><li>We participate in broader efforts within the publishing community to encourage greater understanding around pricing and the costs of Open Access publishing (see immediately below for the Plan S example)</li><li>Our new collective action business model for <em>PLOS Medicine</em> and <em>PLOS Biology — </em><a href="https://plos.org/resources/community-action-publishing/">Community Action Publishing</a> — openly shares how much revenue is required for PLOS to run these specific journals. We will redistribute revenues beyond the target back to community members</li></ol>



<p>This year, we are especially grateful to cOAlition S for spurring the scholarly publishing community, broadly, to engage with transparency via its <a href="https://www.coalition-s.org/price-and-service-transparency-frameworks/">Plan S Price &amp; Service Transparency Framework</a>.</p>



<h3><strong>PLOS Response to Plan S</strong></h3>



<p>In early 2020, PLOS (together with nine other publishers<sup>1</sup>) <a href="https://www.informationpower.co.uk/launch-of-the-plan-s-price-transparency-framework/">piloted </a>one of the two approved pricing transparency frameworks for cOAlition S. We are now <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/16_3Eoxp3_C_xwontOJvLah45YC7Wgg032pGRsa2G_14/edit?usp=sharing">sharing the figures PLOS provided</a> as part of this initiative to provide context to our own pricing and to further promote this kind of transparency broadly within the community. We encourage other publishers to be transparent and openly share their data as well. (Please see the post on price transparency by our friends at <strong>F1000 Research</strong> <a href="https://blog.f1000.com/2020/08/19/price-transparency-on-f1000research/">here</a>.)</p>



<p>Before diving into discussion of figures, we want to restate two underlying principles.  </p>



<ul><li>PLOS does not charge for any activity for the sole purpose of profit. We do not seek or need revenue surplus for return to shareholders, but rather to support and reinvest in our <a href="https://plos.org/">mission</a>.</li></ul>



<ul><li>Our organizational activities are developed to meet the needs of researchers, our prices cover our reasonable costs for our high level of service plus some margin for reinvestment, and our drives for efficiency are to enable as good an author experience as possible.</li></ul>



<p>The Plan S Price &amp; Service Transparency framework invited publishers to divide Article Processing Charge, per journal, into seven categories of activity<sup>2</sup>:</p>



<ul><li><strong>Journal and community development</strong> <strong>efforts</strong>, including commissioning content, researching editorial board members, and scope development</li><li><strong>Submission to desk reject or acceptance</strong></li><li><strong>Peer review management </strong>by staff/remunerated people, including management of submissions that are ultimately rejected</li><li><strong>Acceptance to publication</strong>, including typesetting, conversation, and production tasks</li><li><strong>Services after publication</strong>, including ethics checks and queries, usage statistics, long-term preservation and access monitoring</li><li><strong>Sales &amp; marketing</strong> to customers or of articles, including marketing campaigns</li><li><strong>Author and customer support,</strong> including queries about licensing, citations, and author system troubleshooting</li></ul>



<p>PLOS’ pricing breakdown (which is only one element of the <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/16_3Eoxp3_C_xwontOJvLah45YC7Wgg032pGRsa2G_14/edit?usp=sharing">data captured in the spreadsheet</a>) for 2019 is presented in the table below.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-table"><table><tbody><tr><td></td><td><strong>PLOS Computational Biology</strong></td><td><strong>PLOS Genetics</strong></td><td><strong>PLOS Pathogens</strong></td><td><strong>PLOS Neglected Tropical Diseases</strong></td><td><strong>PLOS Biology</strong></td><td><strong>PLOS Medicine</strong></td><td><strong>PLOS ONE</strong></td></tr><tr><td>APC price</td><td>$2,350</td><td>$2,350</td><td>$2,350</td><td>$2,350</td><td>$3,000</td><td>$3,000</td><td>$1,595</td></tr><tr><td>% of price for journal and community development</td><td>14%</td><td>14%</td><td>14%</td><td>14%</td><td>20%</td><td>18%</td><td>13%</td></tr><tr><td>% of price from submission to desk reject or accept</td><td>15%</td><td>16%</td><td>16%</td><td>15%</td><td>25%</td><td>27%</td><td>21%</td></tr><tr><td>% of price for peer review management</td><td>12%</td><td>12%</td><td>14%</td><td>13%</td><td>21%</td><td>23%</td><td>13%</td></tr><tr><td>% of price for services from acceptance to publication</td><td>22%</td><td>21%</td><td>21%</td><td>21%</td><td>12%</td><td>12%</td><td>20%</td></tr><tr><td>% of price for services after publication</td><td>11%</td><td>11%</td><td>10%</td><td>11%</td><td>6%</td><td>6%</td><td>12%</td></tr><tr><td>% of price for sales &amp; marketing to customers or of articles</td><td>16%</td><td>16%</td><td>14%</td><td>15%</td><td>11%</td><td>8%</td><td>13%</td></tr><tr><td>% of price for author and customer support</td><td>10%</td><td>10%</td><td>11%</td><td>11%</td><td>5%</td><td>6%</td><td>8%</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<p>The above is a relatively good way of illustrating the breadth of activities that occur at PLOS, and which our income supports. However, like any framework or metric, it strips away some of the detail and nuance so we wanted to provide some overarching commentary and highlight a few observations.  </p>



<p><strong>Varied Editorial structures drive varied price allocation</strong></p>



<p>Currently, PLOS has two types of editorial setup across our seven journals. </p>



<ul><li><em>PLOS Biology</em>, <em>PLOS Medicine</em>, and <em>PLOS ONE</em> are supported by senior <strong>in-house</strong> <strong>editorial teams</strong> (including Editors-in-Chief, an Executive Editor, Senior Editors, and Associate Editors) working in conjunction with external editorial boards. </li><li><em>PLOS Computational Biology, PLOS Genetics, PLOS Neglected Tropical Diseases, </em>and <em>PLOS Pathogens</em> each have <strong>external </strong>Editors-in-Chief and Associate Editors (who are full time members of the research, medical, health, and/or academic communities).</li></ul>



<p>The in-house editorial teams (a.k.a. Staff Editors) comprise salaried PLOS employees and are editorially independent. We see this combined expertise of dedicated Staff Editors and leading scientists in the field as an important aspect of the publication process for these titles. Our Staff Editors work to guide researchers through submission and peer review. They also partner with our external Academic Editors, experts in the field, to provide guidance. This unique editorial model ensures expertise, fairness and efficiency for each manuscript. This internal and external resourcing structure is reflected in the greater price share for activities related to “initial triage” and “peer review management” for these particular titles. </p>



<p><strong>Beyond editorial and production</strong></p>



<p>Between 43% – 61% of our journals’ price covers the editorial/production work of receiving submissions, coordinating their peer review, and production and online publication of accepted articles. The remainder of the price covers the broader and deeper work of services before and after the publication process, including marketing, author support, and ethics checks, among other things — each of which is critically important. As examples:</p>



<ul><li>PLOS has a highly regarded <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/s/staff-editors#loc-publication-ethics">publishing ethics team</a> that handles all  ethical and scientific concerns involving submissions and published articles. It also works to raise awareness of publication ethics standards, develops policies and processes to address integrity issues (at scale) prior to publication, and participates in broader discussions about publication ethics policies and practices.</li><li>PLOS engages closely with research communities (e.g. by attending/organizing conferences/events/workshops, these days mostly online) to ensure the journals and their policies truly reflect the research interests and values of these fields and communities. We operate in both global and local contexts, therefore it is ever more important to ensure we reflect the values of the diverse communities of researchers whom we publish.</li><li>PLOS has a dedicated, proactive <a href="https://plos.org/media/">media team</a> that collaborates with authors, institutions, science media centers and journalists to communicate research to both scientists and society. Consequently, articles published in our journals receive great attention in the media. The team also develops policies and participates in industry conversations about best practices (e.g. <a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2020/05/preprints-and-the-media-a-change-to-how-plos-handles-press-for-papers-previously-posted-as-preprints/">preprints and the media</a>). </li><li>PLOS’ Outreach team promotes articles, invites submissions, promotes initiatives like calls for papers, and has also created widely used and well-regarded resources such as the <a href="https://plos.org/resources/for-reviewers/">Peer Review Center</a> and the <a href="https://plos.org/resources/writing-center/">Writing Center</a>. </li><li>PLOS pilots, develops, and leads the way in <a href="https://plos.org/open-science/">Open Science practices</a>, from creating new software to be able to <a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2019/05/plos-journals-now-open-for-published-peer-review/">publish peer review histories at scale</a>, to patiently cultivating trust in science via a rigorous approach to <a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2020/09/transparency-and-trust-peer-review-week-2020/">preprints and preprint commenting</a>. </li><li>PLOS is <a href="https://plos.org/resources/for-institutions/">constantly working</a> to make Open Access easier, more efficient, and fair for researchers from all demographics, geographies, and disciplines. This is both via <a href="https://plos.org/resources/community-action-publishing/">new business model</a> development, and <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Open-Access-RFI-Comments-Reduced-5.pdf">policy engagement</a>. </li></ul>



<p>We hope the full data and above commentary can give you some new insights. At PLOS we are proud of what we do. It is our privilege to devote our time and energy towards such crucial matters as increasing trust in science. We will always do this in partnership with the research community. And, perhaps, there has never been a more important time to be doing this.</p>

                <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/~r/plos/Blog/~3/skoQOMC8LYE/">Open Access Week 2020: Building Equity and Inclusivity in Science</a></h4>

<p>It’s the start of Open Access Week 2020 and this year’s theme focuses on “Open with Purpose” with equity and inclusivity as the focal point for the third consecutive year.</p>



<p><strong>Why are we still talking about this?</strong> </p>



<p>At this time, the need for international collaboration and access without restrictions is acutely apparent with COVID-19 pausing regular activities, such as conferences, libraries and other in person events. Building equity and inclusivity will create a stronger environment for scientists to ask questions or see problems from a different perspective. It’s also integral for organizations to reflect on what they can do to help researchers from every background get their research to the communities that need it.</p>



<p><br /><strong>Looking to an inclusive future<br /></strong>OA helps break down many of the barriers researchers face by sharing their findings to a vast readership. Yet, a number of hurdles still stand between them and the final article. At PLOS, we support researchers at every stage of their career, research and discipline. Open Science further increases transparency and visibility of their work so that all researchers can more easily be recognized for their contributions. With a host of journals and a variety of article types and early sharing methods such as preprints and preregistered reports — researchers will have the opportunity to showcase the full breadth of their findings. </p>



<p>We recognize that as an organization we can do much more to assist those in the scientific community that experience challenges due to their gender, race, culture and more. In a <a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2020/07/our-commitment-to-diversity-equity-and-inclusion/">blog post by Editorial Director Joerg Heber</a>, he outlines our support for a diverse and inclusive community and the areas we’ll continue to improve on to recognize and minimize bias, further diversify our leadership and contributors.</p>



<p><strong>Be counted for your work</strong></p>



<p>OA provides the community with the accessibility to your research to see, cite, and share it. Your research and contributions in the community are vital to scientific advancements. Be proud, in whatever stage of your career, of what you’ve achieved and get the recognition for your contributions, be that through your ORCID iD or citations. The OA community is increasingly adapting to the needs of ECRs. Transparency and early sharing practices for every stage of the research process are becoming increasingly common to support researchers in demonstrating their contributions, beyond just publications. Be the first to report your findings with <a href="https://plos.org/open-science/preprints/">preprints</a> and <a href="https://plos.org/open-science/preregistration/">preregistration</a>, just two ways in which you can highlight your progress early when you’re applying for funding and new positions. </p>



<p>PLOS is always searching for new ways we can make publishing and acknowledging your work easier. Whether that means building a more inclusive framework to ensure credit is shared equitably among contributors, or supporting researchers in making their work more visible.  In a new <a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2020/10/implementing-name-changes-for-published-transgender-authors/">policy announced last week</a>, we’re providing better support to transgender authors with live articles published under names that do not reflect their identity. Our staff will be happy to help update your records and help you keep your previous credits. </p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-style-default"><p>Publishing an academic study is an achievement for researchers to be proud of, and it is important that the name on the paper reflects who the authors are. </p><cite>— <em><a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2020/10/implementing-name-changes-for-published-transgender-authors/">Implementing name changes for published transgender authors</a></em></cite></blockquote>



<p><strong>Open Access is more important than ever</strong></p>



<p>In a time where COVID-19 proves to be a challenging obstacle with restrictions to labs and libraries, it is integral that we’re inclusive of the many groups in the scientific community — researchers around the world need access to content anywhere, anytime. OA is the key to providing fast, public access to research with no restrictions or embargoes. The global benefit of open research is powerful and will help maintain the continuation of scientific advancements.</p>



<p><br />At the heart of inclusivity, cost plays a major role in separating researchers from the Open Access journals they would like to publish in. Over this year we’ve made great strides in partnering with institutions and consortia to bridge the gap between cost for prospective PLOS authors. And we’re continuing to experiment with new models that get closer to a truly open to read, open to publish ideal, equitably distributing the costs of publishing so that the burden of payment doesn’t fall on authors. </p>



<p><strong>Next steps for a fair and diverse future</strong></p>



<p>We will continue to improve our processes and endeavour to be advocates for equity and inclusivity in OA and the broader academic community. Beyond 2020, scholarly communication will need to continue the work around creating inclusive environments for researchers by examining the struggles of systemic inequities, acknowledge bias by working with editors and reviewers, and ultimately take action to create a more accessible future for all. More updates to come! </p>

                <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/~r/plos/Blog/~3/1kHrTHEX73c/">Rethinking Research Assessment:Addressing Institutional Biases in Review, Promotion, and Tenure Decision-Making (part IV)</a></h4>

<p><em>Authors: Ruth Schmidt is an Associate Professor at IIT’s Institute of Design and Anna Hatch is the program director for</em><a href="https://sfdora.org/"><em> </em></a><a href="https://sfdora.org/"><em>DORA</em></a><em>. PLOS supports DORA financially via organizational membership, and PLOS is represented on the steering committee of DORA.</em></p>



<p><em>In <a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2020/09/rethinking-research-assessment-addressing-institutional-biases-in-review-promotion-and-tenure-decision-making/">part one </a>of our series we showed how objective comparisons are not equitable . In our <a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2020/10/rethinking-research-assessment-addressing-institutional-biases-in-review-promotion-and-tenure-decision-making-part-ii/">second part</a> of this series we showed how individual data points can accidentally distract from the whole. <a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2020/10/rethinking-research-assessment-addressing-institutional-biases-in-review-promotion-and-tenure-decision-making-part-iii/">In part 3</a> we explored how we gauge value by association. In our final installment we get into how <strong>incumbent processes and perceptions have the advantage</strong></em><strong>.</strong></p>



<p>The deep legacy traditions held by many academic institutions can be powerful, contributing a sense of continuity and identity and reducing the need to continually reinvent the wheel. But when these organizational habits and norms become too normalized, and old processes and structures persist because “that’s how we’ve always done this,” they can create an unhealthy sense of insularity that excludes new ideas and people.</p>



<p>One contributing factor to this is<strong> Confirmation bias</strong>, which describes peoples’ tendencies to dismiss evidence that doesn’t fit their initial judgments or preconceptions, even if these presumptions are grounded in subjective experiences and limited data. Failing to gather and consider counter-evidence makes us more likely to fall into old ways of thinking, such as cherry-picking information from a CV to confirm the view we already have, or dismissing potential warning signs because a candidate has already been accepted as a good fit.</p>



<p><strong>Status quo bias</strong>, sometimes known as “effort aversion,” reflects our tendency to take the path of least resistance unless there are strong reasons not to. This can lead to situations where people stick with recognizably flawed processes because the effort to fix them or adopt new ones is perceived as too much effort. For example, the continued use of citations to indicate research quality is driven in part by the fact that it’s perceived as familiar and easier, not necessarily better, than using alternate indicators of real-world impact. For academic institutions — never known as stealthy and agile entities even in the best of times — this can cause significant paralysis, keeping demonstrably subpar structures in place long past their usefulness.</p>



<p><em>What can institutions do?</em></p>



<p><strong>Make it easy.</strong> Sometimes the biggest barriers to adopting new behaviors are actually smaller than one might expect, such as not knowing where to start or a lack of clarity about the value of doing things differently. Making the benefits of new behaviors concrete, salient, and simple to grasp makes both starting and follow-through easier.</p>



<p><strong>Question what you “know.”</strong> Sticking with old assumptions tends to reward those with more traditional backgrounds, which comes at the expense of attracting new or more diverse talent. Productively pushing back on assumptions — even assigning the role of playing devil’s advocate during deliberations — can force all involved to be crisper and more defined about what qualities matter, and why.</p>



<p><strong>Broaden notions of success.</strong> New processes can only go so far if definitions for success (and who’s invited to the table) aren’t also revisited. Setting, publicizing, and adhering to goals that look beyond traditional norms or value alternate experiences can broaden the diversity of individuals under consideration.</p>



<p>Incumbent systems, processes, and structures are inherently advantaged, partly due to familiarity and partly because our tendency toward effort aversion tells us it’s almost always easier to stick with the old, however flawed, than introduce something new. This is especially true when those in positions of seniority have benefited from these legacy systems as their careers have progressed, and when in many cases entire academic careers spent at an individual institution may mean limited insight into even <em>how</em> to do things differently. But the need to introduce more equitable decision-making into RPT decisions to increase the presence of minoritized candidates, researchers, and faculty is very real, and will not happen without a combination of serious intent and structural support. Without active intervention, one model of current post-doc to faculty transitions has indicated that <a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/21393">faculty diversity will not otherwise significantly increase until 2080</a>. This is too little, too late.</p>



<p><a><em>To encourage the adoption of more equitable hiring, and RPT processes, the authors are collaborating on a series of tools for DORA to assist institutions in experimenting with new processes, indicators, and principles.

<p>Four million monthly users. 1.7 million articles. More than one billion downloads.</p>
<p>The numbers are clear: arXiv is a critical resource.</p>
<p>But what these numbers don’t reveal? The impact arXiv has had on individual people across the globe.</p>
<p>The excitement of a grad student posting their first article. The junior faculty member who just earned tenure, thanks to research originally shared on arXiv. The productive researcher whose library cannot afford to subscribe to all the right journals. The weekly research group meeting to discuss the most recent arXiv papers. The interdisciplinary collaboration sparked by an arXiv submission. The machine learning enthusiast who tinkers with the arXiv dataset, future discoveries yet unknown.</p>
<h3>“arXiv is like air.”</h3>
<p>These are the words of an arXiv-er. In other words, arXiv is free, totally necessary, and easy to take for granted.</p>
<p>But arXiv is not free to produce, which is why we’re asking you to <a href="https://securelb.imodules.com/s/1717/alumni/event.aspx?sid=1717&amp;gid=2&amp;pgid=22315&amp;cid=35778&amp;dids=276&amp;bledit=1&amp;sort=1">join arXiv’s community of supporters with a donation</a> during <strong>International Open Access Week</strong>, from October 19th through the 23rd. We urge you to consider recurring payments in any amount.</p>
<p>More than 80% of arXiv’s operating budget comes from voluntary contributions from the Simons Foundation, member institutions, and <strong>individuals like you</strong>. Your contribution will help ensure that arXiv remains <strong>a non-commercial, community resource.</strong></p>

<p><a href="https://blog.arxiv.org/files/2020/10/core-logo.png"><img alt="CORE logo" class="alignright wp-image-719 size-medium" height="127" src="https://blog.arxiv.org/files/2020/10/core-logo-300x127.png" width="300" /></a></p>
<p><a href="https://arxiv.org/">arXiv</a> readers now have a faster way to find articles relevant to their interests. From an article abstract page, readers can simply activate the CORE Recommender to find additional open access research on similar topics.</p>
<p>The Recommender, part of the <a href="https://labs.arxiv.org/">arXivLabs</a> toolset, was developed by <a href="https://core.ac.uk/">CORE</a>, a global aggregator of open access scientific content, which provides access to millions of full texts. CORE’s mission is to aggregate all open access research outputs from repositories and journals worldwide and make them available to the public. In this way, CORE facilitates free unrestricted access to research for all.</p>
<p>To generate a list of recommended works, the tool utilizes an algorithm based on the article’s full text and metadata, including title, authors, and abstract. The suggestions come both from arXiv and other resources in the CORE collection, and as many as five articles with freely accessible full texts might be recommended. A detailed explanation and discussion of the algorithm, by CORE founder Petr Knoth and his coauthors, is <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1705.00578">available on arXiv</a>.</p>
<p>These recommendations benefit readers, who will access relevant information more quickly, and authors, whose open access content will become more visible to interested readers.</p>
<p>“I am very excited about this partnership as arXiv and CORE are both fully embracing the same vision of openness to research for all,” said Petr Knoth, founder and head of CORE. “This partnership will further improve open access infrastructure. It will help arXiv users to discover open access research papers relevant to their work from across the whole network of open access repositories.”</p>
<p>“We are happy to welcome CORE to the arXivLabs family,” said arXiv executive director Eleonora Presani, “and we believe the Recommender will help arXiv users discover the content most relevant to their research.”</p>
<p>arXiv values openness, community, and the privacy of user data and only works with partners that abide by the same principles. Like all third party collaborators, CORE will only have access to minimal and anonymized data about arXiv users, and only for the purpose of ensuring the correct functioning of the arXivLabs features. Any other use not included in a written consent from arXiv is strictly prohibited. Upon user request this data, and another other data connected to the user can be permanently deleted.</p>

<p>The following press release was issued on Wednesday, October 14th at 12:01 Pacific.</p>



<p>SAN FRANCISCO — Jisc, the digital solutions provider for education and research in the UK, and the Public Library of Science (PLOS) today announced two 3-year Open Access (OA) agreements that allow researchers to publish in PLOS journals without incurring article processing charges (APC). This is the first time that a large university consortium has provided collective agreements as an alternative to APCs at this scale. Jisc and PLOS will also collaborate on future data, metrics, and tools for institutions to evaluate OA publishing agreements.</p>



<p>“Jisc has always been a priority partner, given its high profile, its large existing institutional account base with PLOS, and leadership role in the library community,” said Sara Rouhi, director of strategic partnerships for PLOS. “It’s always exciting to partner with a forward-leaning organization whose values and priorities around Open Access and Open Science align with our own. We also look forward to sharing the fruits of this partnership with the broader community.”</p>

<p>Caren Milloy, Jisc’s director of licensing, adds: “We are pleased to have reached these pioneering agreements with PLOS, which will make it easier for researchers to publish OA and offer affordability and sustainability to institutions. These collective action agreements have the potential to help shape the future of OA funding.”</p>



<p>Under the flat fee agreement, which begins on January 1, 2021, annual fixed prices will cover uncapped publishing in five PLOS journals<a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plos/Blog#_ftn1">[1]</a> for corresponding authors affiliated with participating Jisc institutions as well as custom reporting and collaboration on future reporting standards initiatives. The PLOS Community Action Publishing agreement, facilitates uncapped publishing in PLOS’ two highly selective journals<a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plos/Blog#_ftn2">[2]</a> through a collective action model. Both corresponding and contributing authors affiliated with participating Jisc institutions are eligible. The model itself is predicated on cost recovery, capped margins, and redistributing revenues above target back to community members.</p>



<p>These agreements empower authors who want to participate in Open Access publishing, and support a diverse scholarly communication ecosystem for researchers and readers. </p>

                <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/~r/plos/Blog/~3/Py94lQGyxhA/">PLOS accesses Dimensions on Google Cloud’s BigQuery</a></h4>

<p>Digital Science and PLOS are pleased to announce an agreement which will provide PLOS, the leading Open Access (OA) publisher with access to Dimensions on BigQuery. Dimensions is a comprehensive database that covers the full research and innovation lifecycle. BigQuery, Google Cloud’s serverless and secure multi-cloud data warehouse, enables PLOS to analyse the full metadata of Dimensions and use it to inform strategy and decision-making across the organization.</p>



<p>This follows the recent Digital Science partnership with Google Cloud, which was designed to remove barriers to data access, analysis and visualization for organizations across the research and innovation ecosystem. In today’s environment, stakeholders in the research and innovation ecosystem are seeking to make better, evidence-based decisions. To do this, they need greater access to contextual information, while at the same time protecting the security of their own data.</p>



<p>Dimensions is a research information platform which has been developed to provide a comprehensive view on the research process and activities  – going beyond publications and citations. While covering 112 million publications with 1.2 billion citations, Dimensions also interlinks data from $1.8 trillion of funded grants, 583,000 clinical trials, 40 million patents, 453k policy documents and 1.5 million datasets. </p>



<p>PLOS has been using Dimensions Analytics and the Dimensions API since early 2020, and is also an existing Google BigQuery user. This latest agreement therefore fits seamlessly with PLOS’s own data strategy, providing their staff Dimensions data on Google BigQuery to help shape their business development strategy, monitor trends in the OA landscape — such as providing evidence to support Open Access Transformative Agreements, and create custom dashboards and reports that can be securely accessed and shared across their organization. PLOS will now be able to combine their own internal data with Dimensions external data sources, helping create a 360° view of the research landscape.   </p>



<p>Kristen Monahan, Data &amp; Insights Senior Manager, said:<em> – </em>“PLOS already relies on Dimensions for baseline data about institutions and funding to assist in our agreement discussions and uses a combination of Dimensions and internal data for business analytics. Also having access to Dimensions data via Google BigQuery gives us tremendous freedom to analyse and integrate Dimensions data across our organization.”<em> </em></p>



<p>Christian Herzog, CEO Dimensions, said: “We’re very pleased that, through this agreement, PLOS staff will get unprecedented access to the Dimensions database. This brings them full flexibility to perform advanced analytics at industry-leading speeds and create personalized dashboards and reports. More importantly, however, it brings them greater access to the contextual information in Dimensions that supports their thoughtful approach to informed, evidence-based decision-making.”</p>

<p><em>NIH will be providing up to a two-receipt cycle of eligibility for prospective applicants to the BRAIN Initiative Advanced Postdoctoral Career Transition Award to Promote Diversity (K99/R00) through the February/March 2021 due dates.</em></p>
<p><span id="more-2757"></span></p>
<p>As a result of the myriad disruptions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, the NIH BRAIN Initiative will be providing up to a <strong>two-receipt cycle extension (roughly eight additional months) of eligibility for prospective applicants</strong>. These applicants must meet the requirements for submission of an application to the BRAIN Initiative K99/R00 Advanced Postdoctoral Career Transition Award to Promote Diversity (<a href="https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/rfa-files/rfa-ns-19-043.html">RFA-NS-19-043</a> or <a href="https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/rfa-files/rfa-ns-19-044.html">RFA-NS-19-044</a>) through the February/March 2021 due dates.</p>
<p>For eligible applicants submitting new or resubmission applications, the two-receipt cycle extension will be automatically accepted by the NIH; no additional documentation is required.</p>
<p>To aid potential applicants in determining whether they are eligible for the extension, the following examples are provided:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Example 1: </strong>For individuals whose eligibility ended with the June/July 2020 due dates, the temporary extension would allow them to apply for the K99/R00 until February/March 2021.</li>
<li><strong>Example 2: </strong>For individuals whose eligibility would normally end with October/November 2020 due dates, the temporary extension would allow them to apply in February/March 2021 or June/July 2021.</li>
<li><strong>Example 3: </strong>For individuals whose eligibility would normally end with February/March 2021 due dates, the temporary extension would allow them to apply in June/July 2021 or October/November 2021.</li>
</ul>
<p>This policy may be subject to future updates. Prospective K99 applicants who wish to receive non-COVID-related extensions (such as those for childbirth, adoption, family leave, etc.) must continue to provide relevant documentation.</p>
<p>All other aspects of these FOAs remain unchanged. For more information, please view the full <a href="https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/notice-files/NOT-NS-21-004.html">notice</a> and direct any questions to <a href="mailto:BRAINDIVERSITYK99R00@nih.gov">BRAINDIVERSITYK99R00@nih.gov</a>.</p>

<p class="">The putamen is a <a href="https://www.neuroscientificallychallenged.com/glossary/subcortical" target="_blank">subcortical</a> structure that is part of a group of structures known as the <a href="https://www.neuroscientificallychallenged.com/glossary/basal-ganglia" target="_blank">basal ganglia</a>. It is also a component of the dorsal <a href="https://www.neuroscientificallychallenged.com/glossary/striatum" target="_blank">striatum</a>, which includes the putamen and the <a href="https://www.neuroscientificallychallenged.com/glossary/caudate" target="_blank">caudate nucleus</a>. The putamen is adjacent to the <a href="https://www.neuroscientificallychallenged.com/glossary/globus-pallidus" target="_blank">globus pallidus</a>, and the putamen and globus pallidus together are sometimes referred to as the <a href="https://www.neuroscientificallychallenged.com/glossary/lentiform-nucleus" target="_blank">lentiform or lenticular nucleus</a>. </p><p class="" data-rte-preserve-empty="true"></p><h2>What is the putamen and what does it do?</h2><p class="">As a component of the basal ganglia, the putamen is best known for its role in facilitating movement. To understand the putamen’s role in movement, it’s helpful to think about how the basal ganglia as a whole may contribute to movement. While this has not been determined definitively, one popular hypothesis suggests that the basal ganglia are important for facilitating desired movements while at the same time inhibiting unwanted and/or competing movements. To read more about the basal ganglia and this purported function, see <a href="https://www.neuroscientificallychallenged.com/blog/what-are-basal-ganglia" target="_blank">this article</a>. </p><p class="">Watch this 2-Minute Neuroscience video to learn more about the basal ganglia.</p><p class="">The putamen (and striatum as a whole) is thought to act as a critical input area for the basal ganglia. In other words, to accomplish their movement-related functions, the basal ganglia need to receive information from the <a href="https://www.neuroscientificallychallenged.com/glossary/cerebral-cortex" target="_blank">cerebral cortex</a> about movements that you want to make. Much of this information travels first to the putamen or the caudate via a pathway called the <a href="https://www.neuroscientificallychallenged.com/glossary/corticostriatal-pathway" target="_blank">corticostriatal pathway</a>. </p><p class="">Most of the neurons in the putamen contain the neurotransmitter <a href="https://www.neuroscientificallychallenged.com/glossary/gaba" target="_blank">GABA</a> and extend out of the putamen to other regions of the basal ganglia— specifically the <a href="https://www.neuroscientificallychallenged.com/glossary/globus-pallidus" target="_blank">globus pallidus</a> and the <a href="https://www.neuroscientificallychallenged.com/glossary/substantia-nigra" target="_blank">substantia nigra</a>. These neurons that leave the putamen create pathways that are thought to be involved in either the facilitation or inhibition of movements (depending on the pathway). <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9004351/" target="_blank">Research suggests that neurons in the putamen are activated before and during movement</a>—especially movement of the limbs and torso. It is thought that the firing of these putamen neurons contributes not only to the initiation of a movement, but also to the decision to make a movement and the selection of a movement to make.</p><p class="">For years, the putamen was considered to be primarily devoted to movement. But more recent research has begun to point to an expanded role for the putamen. For example, it is now thought that that the putamen is also involved with <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12052921/" target="_blank">learning and memory</a>, <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28585051/" target="_blank">language</a>, and <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2569212/" target="_blank">emotion</a>. </p><p class="">Dysfunction in the putamen could be a factor in a number of disorders, but is strongly linked to problems with motor function. <a href="https://www.neuroscientificallychallenged.com/glossary/huntingtons-disease" target="_blank">Huntington’s disease</a> (HD), for example—which is characterized by rapid and spasmodic involuntary movements—is associated with<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27529157" target="_blank"> the degeneration and death of neurons in the caudate and putamen</a>. These neurons may be involved with the inhibition of unwanted movements, and their degeneration in HD may cause involuntary movement to be more difficult to suppress. </p><p class=""><a href="https://www.neuroscientificallychallenged.com/glossary/neurodegeneration" target="_blank">Neurodegeneration</a> in the basal ganglia is also the hallmark pathological sign of <a href="https://www.neuroscientificallychallenged.com/glossary/parkinsons-disease" target="_blank">Parkinson’s disease</a> (PD), a condition that causes slow, labored movement along with tremors (among other symptoms). With PD, the neurodegeneration occurs primarily in the <a href="https://www.neuroscientificallychallenged.com/glossary/substantia-nigra" target="_blank">substantia nigra</a>, but other areas of the basal ganglia—<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6641567" target="_blank">like the putamen</a>—are also affected. Additionally, <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30465864/" target="_blank">abnormalities in dopamine function in the putamen</a> are thought to contribute to the movement problems PD patients experience.</p><h3><br /><br />References<strong> </strong>(in addition to linked text above)<strong>:</strong></h3><p class="">Mink JW.

<p><em>Bruno Pichler studied medicine, obtained a PhD in neuroscience, worked in the labs of <a href="http://www.ifn.me.tum.de/new/konnerth.php">Arthur Konnerth</a>, <a href="https://www.sainsburywellcome.org/web/groups/mrsic-flogel-lab">Tom Mrsic-Flogel</a> and <a href="https://www.sainsburywellcome.org/web/groups/margrie-lab">Troy Margrie</a>, and was R&amp;D manager at <a href="https://www.scientifica.uk.com/">Scientifica</a>, before founding his own company, <a href="https://www.inss.org.uk/">INSS</a>, “to provide the international neuroscience community with bespoke hard- and software solutions and other consulting services”. He is not only a highly experienced builder and designer of two-photon microscopes but also a very friendly and open human being. So I was very happy to have the opportunity to ask him a couple of questions.</em></p>



<p><em>The interview took place on September 8</em><sup><em>th</em></sup><em> 2020 in a virtual meeting and lasted around 1.5 hours. Afterwards, I transcribed, shortened and edited the recorded interview. For a brief orientation, here’s an ordered but non-exhaustive list of the topics discussed:</em></p>



<p><em>Why neuroscience?<br />How to get into optics and programming<br />Role models<br />Projects in academia<br />Why didn’t you become a PI?<br />At Scientifica<br />Founding one’s own company<br />Brexit<br />Performance checks for a 2P scope<br />Preamplifiers<br />How to clean optics<br />The detection path<br />Teaching people how to solve problems<br />Mesoscopes<br />mesoSPIM<br />AODs<br />Fixed-wavelength lasers<br />Multiplexed acquisition<br />Scanimage<br />Okinawa<br />Advice to young scientists<br />Bluegrass music<br /><br />If you find any questionable statements, you should consider blaming my editing first.</em></p>



<p><em>And since the entire interview is quite long, take a cup of tea, and take your time to read it</em>…</p>

<p><strong>Peter Rupprecht: </strong>You studied medicine before you started your PhD. What was your motivation to do a PhD in neuroscience, and to continue in neuroscience afterwards?</p>



<p><strong>Bruno Pichler:</strong> This was just something that happened: I really loved the first years of medical school, basic science, physics, biology, anatomy, physiology, and all that. But halfway through medical school when the clinical work started, I realized that it wasn’t for me. So I looked for new inspiration, and I stumbled upon the website of Arthur Konnerth’s lab. I called on a whim and half an hour later I was in his office, and he offered me a job. He said, “why don’t you take a year off from medical school and start working towards a PhD here?” So I worked full-time in the lab for a year, and then went back to finish medical school. But at that point I had no interest in a career in clinical medicine, I just wanted to complete the medical degree and then work in the lab and continue my PhD. – So, not much thought behind it, it’s just how things transpired.</p>

<p><strong>PR:</strong> The medical studies did not really prepare you well for the more technical aspects of what you have been doing afterwards. How did you learn all of this, for example optics, or programming?</p>



<p><strong>BP: </strong>Again, it was just something that happened: there were microscopes that needed troubleshooting, there were things I didn’t understand, and every time I didn’t understand something, I tried to find more information about it. Some of the information sticks with you – and that’s how you learn and how you get into optics and software.<br />For example, there was some custom-written image analysis software in the lab and I didn’t really understand what it did to the data, so I sat down with the guy who wrote it and asked about all the calculations it made and then I cautiously started to make some changes to it – and it just naturally emerged from there. I never consciously sat down and said, “oh, I want to learn programming!” I had a problem in front of me that I needed to solve, and so I solved it. And whatever I learned while solving it is now part of my knowledge.</p>



<p class="has-blue-color has-text-color" style="font-size: 23px; line-height: 1.1;">“People who inspired me were often those in support roles, like the lab technicians who taught me how to pipette, or the engineers in the electronic and mechanical workshops.”</p>



<p><strong>PR:</strong> So would you describe yourself as a problem-solver?</p>



<p><strong>BP: </strong>I think that is probably an accurate description. My main driving force is that whenever I see a technical problem, I want to find an elegant solution for it. I can’t help it.</p>



<p><strong>PR: </strong>Did you have a role model as a scientist, or somebody who inspired you to continue with neuroscience?</p>



<p><strong>BP: </strong>I definitely have a few people who inspired me, but I wouldn’t say I had a ‘role model’. There’s obviously the intellectual giants like Richard Feynman or Horace Barlow. Then there are the scientists that I worked with, Arthur Konnerth, Tom Mrsic-Flogel, Troy Margrie, and of course all the colleagues in those labs. But, on a very practical level, people who inspired me were often those in support roles, like the lab technicians who taught me how to pipette, or the engineers in the electronic and mechanical workshops. For example, Werner Zeitz, the electronics guy in Arthur Konnerth’s lab, who is known for his famous Zeitz puller (<a href="https://www.zeitz-puller.com/" rel="nofollow">https://www.zeitz-puller.com/</a>). We were building a two-photon resonant scanner with Werner back in 2004/2005, and he built a 19” rack-mountable device box – no labels on it, just unlabeled pots and BNC connectors – which transformed the scanning data into a TV image and sent it to a frame grabber card. Nowadays, we do this in software but it was all done in hardware at the time. Same with the mechanical guy, Dietmar Beyer: He was such a skilled manual machinist, and he would just make whatever we needed without any CNC machining. Another guy that really inspired me back as a PhD student was Yury Kovalchuk. He was a senior postdoc at the time. He knew everything about two-photon microscopy, and he was building an AOD scanner back in 2004/2005. It was the way he understood these systems and explained everything to me whenever I had any questions – those kind of people inspired me.</p>



<p><strong>PR:</strong> From your entire academic career, what was your most rewarding project, big or small?</p>



<p><strong>BP:</strong> That’s so difficult to say, because everything is kind of rewarding. What I can certainly say is that I don’t believe in putting off reward for a long time, and the idea that ‘the more you suffer, the bigger the reward’. I like it when you have smaller rewards, but more frequently.</p>



<p><strong>PR:</strong> I can definitely relate to this… but at least scientific publications usually do not come so frequently. If you have to choose, which scientific publication where you took part in would you like to highlight, and what was your contribution?</p>



<p><strong>BP: </strong>There was a paper in 2012 by Kamilla Angelo in Troy Margrie’s lab (<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3442227/">paper link</a>). I came very late to the party, all the experiments had already been done, the first version of the manuscript had been completed, and Troy just asked me to read it and give some comments. I noticed something in the analysis where the manuscript didn’t actually show unambiguously one aspect of the claim in the paper. We tried to come up with some way to design new experiments to prove that unambiguously, but at some point it occurred to me that you could just do it with the existing data, just with a different type of analysis. And once the idea had come up of doing this pair-wise scrambling of all the data points and then calculating pair-wise differences, it was very quick and easy to write some code to analyze it. And it supported exactly what we thought it would support, but now unambiguously. That felt really rewarding, to be able to nail something that would have otherwise required more experiments with a bit of clever analysis, that was really cool.</p>



<p><strong>PR:</strong> Sounds like that! Especially your PI was probably really happy about this, because it saved a lot of trouble.</p>



<p><strong>BP:</strong> I guess so. The paper would have been highly publishable without my input, but it was just ever so slightly better with my input; and that’s good enough for me.</p>



<p class="has-blue-color has-text-color" style="font-size: 23px; line-height: 1.1;">“I was always more of a Malcolm Young than an Angus Young.”</p>



<p><strong>PR: </strong>Why did you not become a PI yourself?</p>



<span id="more-6555"></span>



<p><strong>BP: </strong>Well, to start with, I was never really PI material …</p>



<p><strong>PR:</strong> What would you define as PI material?</p>



<p><strong>BP: </strong>Are you okay with an AC/DC reference? Would you understand what I mean when I say “I was always more of a Malcolm Young than an Angus Young”?</p>



<p><strong>PR: </strong>No, not really …</p>



<p><strong>BP: </strong>Malcolm Young was the rhythm guitarist in AC/DC, he was always in the background and played this steady rhythm, whereas Angus Young is the flamboyant lead guitarist in his school uniform who runs up and down the stage and is the focal point of attention for the audience. When I say “I was always more of a Malcolm Young than an Angus Young”, I’m talking about having a rock-solid line of people in the back who make sure that the lead guitarist and the lead singer can shine: I like to be in that role at the back. As a PI, you have to represent the lab, you have to present your work outside, you have to sell the ideas to funding bodies… so you have to have a little bit more of a flamboyant and outgoing nature. I’m too shy for this, so the PI path was never really on the cards for me to begin with. I was quite happy to be a sort of a medium level scientist – except that I felt there was more I could do to help other people. It felt self-indulgent to just play around with cool technology and have brainy conversations with smart people in the lab. I wanted to provide some value for others.</p>



<p><strong>PR:</strong> And then you chose Scientifica. Why Scientifica? How did that happen?</p>



<p><strong>BP: </strong>I did not really choose Scientifica. I wasn’t actually looking for a job when I left academia. My plan was to go back to the Bavarian Alps and work as a skiing instructor –that’s what I had done before I went to medical school. I figured that it would be really nice to do that again for a season, to pass the time until some new opportunity floated past. And then it just so happened that the opportunity to work at Scientifica floated past earlier than I had anticipated. They rang me and said, “we’ve heard you’re leaving academia and we’re looking for a software person to do some custom stuff for Scientifica’s two-photon customers”, and I was like “well, that sounds like a good idea”, and then I joined Scientifica. There was no job interview, there was no searching for a job, the job found me.</p>



<p><strong>PR:</strong> How was the work like at Scientifica?</p>



<p><strong>BP:</strong> Initially it was mostly intended to be customization of software, for example little Matlab add-ons for Scanimage or stuff like that. But then we also needed a resonant scanning system, and there wasn’t really any software available for resonant scanning before Vidriotech started …</p>



<p><strong>PR:</strong> … and then you wrote SciScan.</p>



<p><strong>BP: </strong>And that’s when I wrote SciScan. I had already written a software for resonant scanning in Labview some years before – for the frame-grabber that we discussed earlier, so I already knew what to do. While writing SciScan I also became involved in the hardware development of the resonant scanner, with the mechanical engineer and the electrical engineer. And so the job role gradually moved towards R&amp;D management.</p>



<p><strong>PR:</strong> I’m a bit younger, so I don’t know whether the resonant scanners always came from Cambridge Technology, or was there a different provider? Or did you build the scanners in-house at Scientifica?</p>



<p><strong>BP: </strong>No, the resonant scanners were always the same as back in 2003 when I first started using them. The manufacturer was originally called General Scanning Inc, then it became GSI Lumonics, which later merged with <a href="https://www.cambridgetechnology.com/">Cambridge Technology</a>, which was then bought by Novanta. There was a number of name changes involved, but no changes to the product.</p>



<p><strong>PR:</strong> Have you tried out resonant scanners from other companies as well?</p>



<p><strong>BP:</strong> I’m only aware of one other resonant scanner that is suitable for what we’re doing and that’s from a company called <a href="http://www.eopc.com/scanners.html">EOPC</a>. I have not actually worked with their resonant scanners yet, but I will be in probably about two weeks from now. We have bought two of their resonant scanners, because they can be synchronized with each other.</p>



<p><strong>PR:</strong> Sounds like a challenging project. Probably with two pulsed lasers?</p>



<p><strong>BP: </strong>No, it’s about temporal multiplexing with a single laser. We want the scanners to run in synchrony so that we can use a single data acquisition system for the two paths.</p>



<p class="has-blue-color has-text-color" style="font-size: 23px; line-height: 1.1;">“When I was a scientist, I was building stuff myself because there wasn’t any company that I could go to and ask them to build it for me. And when I started INSS that was still true.”</p>



<p><strong>PR: </strong>Okay, this makes sense. – After Scientifica, you founded your own company, INSS. What was the biggest challenge when you got started? And why did you found your own company?</p>



<p><strong>BP: </strong>The ‘why’ is very easy to explain: When I started with Scientifica, I was very close to the customers, I was building custom software modules, was interacting with scientists very closely when it came to making hardware modifications to any of the existing products or new suggestions for new hardware products. As the company grew bigger, I got more into a management role. I felt I was getting a little bit too far away from the customer and more involved in managing people and conducting things internally. It is a whole different style of working when you want to make something that is not a prototype but a production item where you want to sell 100 pieces of. Then you have to think more about questions like, how can we design it in a way that you can build it routinely and efficiently, and you have to think about all the supply chain, and build assembly instructions, and how you teach people to do that. There’s a lot of work in the background that is relatively far away from the actual experiment that the neuroscientist is going to do with that microscope and I felt like I wanted to get closer to that again. Also, if you want to sell hundreds of microscopes, it’s not really economically viable to do individual customer specials. From a business development perspective it’s perfectly understandable that Scientifica wanted to have a more standard offering and make off-the-shelf turn-key systems. But that was not so much what I was interested in. I like getting involved in changing things, not making the same thing all the time. I also felt that this sort of very customized, individualized service was not something that was available. When I was a scientist, I was building stuff myself because there wasn’t any company that I could go to and ask them to build it for me. And when I started INSS that was still true. If you’re a scientist you either buy a microscope that someone has designed to fit many purposes, but it may not be perfect for your very specific purpose. And I thought, well, surely there’s a need for modifying, customizing, making something perfect for a particular experiment and stripping out everything else that may not be needed. If you custom-build it from off-the-shelf components, you can save a lot of money. And surely from the money that people save they’d be quite happy to give me some of it, if I advise them how to do it.</p>



<p><strong>PR:</strong> Didn’t it feel like shaky ground when you started? I mean, you were responsible for everything, and you didn’t get a salary anymore.</p>



<p><strong>BP:</strong> I think what helped a lot is that I’ve been involved in the music scene, and I knew a lot of musicians that were self-employed. They were getting money from gigs and teaching and playing on other people’s records and they were making a living without being employed – and I felt I could do the same thing. I had been playing gigs, I knew how to ask a pub owner to pay us money for providing music in the pub. And I figured, conceptually it wouldn’t be much different whether I come to your lab and build something for you, or whether I come to your pub and play a gig for you. You just ask beforehand how much you’re going to get paid for the gig, and if it isn’t enough to cover the costs then you can’t play that gig – it’s not exactly rocket science. It was good that I’d done it for a few years in the music business, it gave me a lot more confidence that this would work out in the microscope consulting business, too.</p>



<p><strong>PR: </strong>INSS is based in the UK. Have you been affected by the Brexit so far, or will you be affected by it?</p>



<p><strong>BP: </strong>I haven’t been affected by Brexit yet, everything is still the same until the end of 2020. Nobody knows what sort of forms we will need to fill in next year, and what sort of new hoops we might need to jump through. I’m not going to start worrying about that now because I don’t know what it’s going to be. – Don’t get me wrong: Brexit will be disastrous on so many levels, especially now, piling onto the coronavirus crisis. And of course it’s also a little bit disappointing… I’ve lived in this country for 13 years and I feel like I made a nice contribution, doing science, paying taxes, playing music. And then all these people feel that someone like me shouldn’t be here because we’re a burden on the country and they’d rather pull up the drawbridge; and they think it’s worth taking all these economic consequences of a no-deal Brexit just to keep people like me out of their country. But if that’s what the majority voted for, then I just have to deal with this somehow. I’m reasonably optimistic that I’ll find some way to navigate these new circumstances!</p>



<p><strong>PR:</strong> I get the impression that you are quite optimistic in general. Do you think this is a requirement for being self-employed?</p>



<p><strong>BP: </strong>I think it’s probably a requirement if you don’t want to live a life in misery. You have to be somewhat optimistic or at least relaxed about what the future might hold because the future is kind of uncertain. You’re not going to know what’s going to happen. If you worry about it, it will not change the fact that the future is uncertain. So you might as well say “I’ll jump down that bridge when I get there”.</p>



<p><strong>PR:</strong> If you don’t mind, let’s talk about some technical questions … after you set up a two-photon microscope in somebody’s lab, how do you quickly check its performance? Do you have a specific routine?</p>



<p><strong>BP: </strong>The quickest performance check is to image a pollen grain slide. You check how the spiky pollen grains look like, whether you can section them nicely and how the field of view [FOV] is like. Once you’ve done it a few times, it is everything you need to get a quick qualitative idea of whether everything is working fine. If you want to do it more quantitatively then you obviously want to image beads, you want to check your field flatness, you want to get your precise FOV measurements with some grids, and so on. We have a routine that we’re working with that we constantly improve, but in the majority of cases that’s not even necessary.</p>



<p><strong>PR:</strong> I think there are some companies which sell special calibration slides or samples. When would this be useful, or do you think it is overkill?</p>



<p><strong>BP:</strong> I would love to use those, but they are not really suitable for 2P. You are talking about the Argolight probes?</p>



<p><strong>PR:</strong> Yes…</p>



<p><strong>BP:</strong> So, they specifically mention that you shouldn’t be using them with 2P, or you use them at your own risk. Also, they cost about 8’000 euros. I don’t really want to spend 8’000 euros on something where I can quickly exceed the damage threshold, and that’s why I haven’t used them. I would love to have something like that if it’s available for two photon. In the meantime, I’ll stick with these electron microscopy grids and beads and pollen grains. – What are your thoughts on those, have you tried anything like that?</p>



<p><strong>PR: </strong>Several years ago I also wanted to check the field curvature for a two-photon microscope and borrowed a quite expensive calibration slide from the confocal microscopy facility, but I managed to destroy it, and that’s when I stopped experimenting. Usually, I just use beads and fluorescent plastic slides. Not so much pollen grains, because I have destroyed the slides several times.</p>



<p><strong>BP: </strong><em>(curious) </em>How do you destroy a pollen grain slide?</p>



<p><strong>PR:</strong> Just by leaving the slide somewhere in the setup, until something makes the glass break; which happened to me twice so far. I also made some simple pollen samples in agar, but that’s not possible in winter or autumn. So I’m usually sticking to beads. But in principle I agree, pollen slides are ideal, you quickly find the samples and you can also check how the fluorescence yield changes across the FOV. Do you make your own pollen grain slides?</p>



<p><strong>BP:</strong> We’re using pollen slides from Carolina Biological Supply Company. They make these ready-made pollen grain slides for schools and educational settings and the slide is like five dollars or something.</p>



<p><strong>PR:</strong> I didn’t know they were so cheap! The first scanning confocal microscope that I used [a Leica SP5] had come with a pollen slide, and I had been instructed to treat the slide very carefully, because it was so expensive… So it’s good to know that it can be really cheap! – Just another question about two-photon microscopes: which preamplifier would you recommend for a standard resonant scanning two-photon microscope?</p>



<p><strong>BP:</strong> We often use the Thorlabs preamps, the TIA60, and we also use the Thorlabs PMTs with the built-in preamps, which is quite convenient. You control them through USB, and you can set the amplifier bandwidth in software.</p>



<p><strong>PR: </strong>I thought the bandwidth was fixed at 60 MHz?</p>



<p><strong>BP:</strong> Yes, for the TIA60 preamps, it’s fixed at 60 MHz. For the PMTs with the built-in preamplifiers, you can choose between, I think, 80 MHz, 2.5 MHz and 200 kHz. When we need higher bandwidth for something, then we would use Femto preamps.</p>



<p><strong>PR:</strong> Which one is your preferred preamp from Femto?</p>



<p><strong>BP: </strong>I use the 400 MHz one.</p>



<p class="has-blue-color has-text-color" style="font-size: 23px; line-height: 1.1;">“For me, cleaning always starts with these little rubber ball dust blowers.”</p>



<p><strong>PR:</strong> Let’s talk about objectives… If you were postdoc in a lab and could choose any objective for testing, which one would you choose?</p>



<p><strong>BP:</strong> I had a Nikon 25x NA1.1 when I was in Troy’s lab, and that’s a really nice objective. For the typical applications I was working at – population calcium imaging – that’s just a beautiful objective. I wouldn’t really need to try anything else. I’m sure there are other applications that would benefit from some of these newer Olympus long working distance objectives, but it’s so application specific, and there’s good uses for all of them. So, without having a particular experiment in mind, it would be difficult to answer the question.</p>



<p><strong>PR:</strong> For these Olympus objectives, I think the working distance is something like 4 or 8 mm. Does the 8 mm make any sense for neuroscience applications?</p>



<p><strong>BP:</strong> Again, it depends on your application, right? These objectives were primarily designed for cleared brains, where you don’t have much of a choice, you either use a long working distance or you’re not imaging all of it.</p>



<p><strong>PR:</strong> Ok, I didn’t know that it was for designed for cleared brains. Now, this makes much more sense to me. – Speaking about objectives, how do you usually clean optical elements? Do you use tap water or distilled water, or can you recommend any other protocols?</p>



<p><strong>BP:</strong> For me, cleaning always starts with these little rubber ball dust blowers. You just try to blow everything off that might be there. If that doesn’t work with the blower, you get out the compressed air can. From there, we’ll go to distilled water, and then Purosol. If I can’t get it off with that, I would go to isopropyl alcohol, and then to methanol. But we’re usually dealing with new microscopes, so in the vast majority of cases, we don’t have to go past the compressed air can.</p>



<p><strong>PR: </strong>What do you do with dichroics if they’re dirty or if there’s sticky dust on top of them? Is there anything you can do?</p>



<p><strong>BP:</strong> I wouldn’t really want to go far beyond the distilled water on a dichroic. If I can’t get it off with that, I might try the Purosol, but we don’t encounter dirty dichroics very often, because most of the optics we’re working with are brand new.</p>



<p><strong>PR: </strong>Another question about 2P microscopes: I was always wondering about a proper way to test the alignment and performance of collection optics. How do you check whether collection optics are properly aligned?</p>



<p><strong>BP:</strong> I want to capture all the light that’s coming out of the back aperture of the objective. So, if you just put some light source and a diffuser under the objective – that can be the LED on a phone with a bit of lens tissue on top as a diffuser –, you’ll get a large cone of light coming out the back aperture. Then you screw in a little target at the position where your PMT will be sitting. You should see a spot right in the center that has the size of the PMT sensor.</p>



<p><strong>PR:</strong> Just to repeat, it’s important to remove the PMT in this case, right?</p>



<p><strong>BP:</strong> Yes, you need to remove the PMT and put a target in its place. If you want to do it more quantitatively, it gets difficult. You could use a calibrated light source and count how many photons you get through and compare that over many microscopes and so on. But I don’t think anyone is doing that in practice.</p>



<p class="has-blue-color has-text-color" style="font-size: 23px; line-height: 1.1;">“I don’t want to tell someone how to align a laser, I rather want to be present when they figure it out themselves.”</p>



<p><strong>PR: </strong>Let’s assume a customer writes to you that there’s a problem with their two-photon system, “because the signal becomes weaker”. This is something I also often hear from less experienced colleagues or friends who ask for some help with their setup. What would be your first guess if you don’t know anything else?</p>



<p><strong>BP:</strong> In the first instance I would think of it as a great opportunity to help someone to think systematically about the problem. Because if all they tell me is that “the signal becomes weaker”, then they haven’t really thought about how to communicate a problem in such a way that the other person can do something with it. I would need to know so much more , for example: what’s the signal? what’s the system? what are you measuring? have you done the same experiment over a year, and every day it gets a little bit weaker?, or is that happening within the same animal, or within the same slice? … there’s a thousand different questions. I need to find out what the person means by “signal”, what the person means by “becomes”, what they mean by “weaker”. It’ll be beneficial for that person, and for me, if I can teach them how to clarify their thoughts to themselves, and then communicate them efficiently. Maybe next time they know immediately why it’s becoming weaker simply because they’ve changed the way they think.<br />I have to say that I enjoy it very much to help someone to clarify to themselves what the problem is. It’s very rewarding for the person to figure out the problem by themselves, and it’s rewarding for me to teach someone a problem-solving skill that they might not have had before.</p>



<p><strong>PR: </strong>I think you have also participated in some summer schools?</p>



<p><strong>BP: </strong>That’s right, I’ve been at the <a href="https://meetings.cshl.edu/courses.aspx?course=C-IMAG&amp;year=19">Cold Spring Harbor imaging course</a> five times – which is great fun, a great location and great teachers. I’m also participating every year at <a href="https://www.tenss.ro/">TENSS</a> in Romania, the Transylvanian Experimental Neuroscience Summer School, again a great team of people that are running it with great lecturers and great spirit among students and all the TAs and lecturers. I really enjoy teaching people and helping them to figure things out. I don’t want to tell someone how to align a laser, I rather want to be present when they figure it out themselves. I might nudge them in the right direction, but if I simply told them what to do, I feel I’d be depriving them of a joyful moment of revelation.</p>



<p><strong>PR: </strong>It can also be a bit dangerous to align laser beams, and especially invisible IR beams. To make the laser beam visible, do you use IR viewers?</p>



<p><strong>BP:</strong> I use them occasionally, but only when I have to, so only when I’m working with a fixed-wavelength laser. And even then I try to do as much as I can with viewing cards rather than the viewer itself. Although I tend to go back and forth a little bit between card and viewer.</p>



<p><strong>PR:</strong> For the tunable lasers, do you switch to visible wavelengths or what do you think about the pointing stability of those lasers?</p>



<p><strong>BP:</strong> I usually align everything in the visible range and then, once we switch to IR, I image a uniform slide and check if our alignment is nice and centered. The illumination on the slide tells you whether you’ve gone off a little bit.</p>



<p><strong>PR:</strong> To clarify, I was thinking more about pointing stability when changing the wavelength of the tunable laser for example from 700 nm to 900 nm…</p>



<p><strong>BP:</strong> I don’t think the changes are drastic. But we’re doing the final alignment through the actual scan head based on what we’re seeing on the computer screen from the fluorescent slide, and we’re doing that at 900 or 930 nm anyway. In that sense, the visible beam is only a first approximation.</p>



<p><strong>PR:</strong> But this also means that you have to be quite tall, because otherwise you cannot reach the adjustment screws of the mirrors and at the same time look at the screen to check the fluorescence of the slide…</p>



<p><strong>BP: </strong>Well, you need some access to those screws and a clear visual path to the computer monitor. You can walk around the table and do it from the back, as long as you can see the computer screen, right?</p>



<p><strong>PR: </strong>Yes… probably I was just thinking about some situations in the past where I tried to do this myself and needed to stretch quite far to reach the adjustment screw and at the same time look around the corner to see the screen …</p>



<p><strong>BP:</strong> Have you tried moving the screen?</p>



<p><strong>PR:</strong> Not really … okay, I think you’ve identified the problem, it’s just laziness from my side! – But one more question about objectives: what do you think about two-photon mesoscopes with FOVs of several millimeters? Are they more difficult to build or maintain? Do you think they will become more standard or is it just a trend?</p>



<p><strong>BP: </strong>It completely depends on the application. If there are experiments that you can’t do with a standard FOV microscope, you need a wide FOV microscope. If you want to image two areas simultaneously with cellular resolution that are too far apart for a normal FOV, you don’t really have that much of a choice. A microscope like that is certainly more difficult to build, because you need custom optics for it, which are really expensive, and that is something that will prevent them from becoming really standard in every lab very soon. A lot of experiments don’t require such large FOV microscopes.</p>



<p><strong>PR: </strong>So you don’t think that these objectives or lenses will become much cheaper in the future and allow them to become more standard?</p>



<p><strong>BP:</strong> I don’t think they’ll go down in price very much. And they’re also difficult to maintain, and you need custom pre-chirpers. You basically need a dedicated imaging engineer in the lab who’s maintaining those microscopes, and even if you buy it commercially, for example the <a href="https://www.thorlabs.com/newgrouppage9.cfm?objectgroup_id=10646">2P RAM mesoscope</a> from Thorlabs, you need someone who’s working with that microscope every day to monitor its performance and fine tune it and so on and so forth. I hope that we’ll see a few more mesoscopes popping up in the future, because there are very interesting questions that you can answer with them, and maybe the prices will come down a little bit. But I don’t think they’ll come down far enough for it to be a standard thing that everyone has.</p>



<p class="has-blue-color has-text-color" style="font-size: 23px; line-height: 1.1;">“I wouldn’t be surprised if a three-photon microscope is on the cards at some point. We haven’t done it yet, but if someone asks, I’ll be happy to build one.”</p>



<p><strong>PR: </strong>Do you also have any experience with setting up confocal microscopes or light-sheet microscopes and, if yes, how is this different from setting up two-photon microscopes?</p>



<p><strong>BP: </strong>I have not set up a confocal microscope so far, but I have set up a mesoSPIM light sheet microscope that your colleague Fabian [Voigt] in Fritjof [Helmchen]’s lab has designed. It was a very different experience in the sense that this was probably the first time that we’ve built something where we had basically no input in the design, and we were following someone else’s instructions. That was a little bit daunting, simply because I’d never done it before, but Fabian’s documentation is just so excellent that it turned out to be not a problem at all, and in that sense it was not much different to what we usually do when building a two-photon.</p>



<p><strong>PR:</strong> Do you also have any plans of building a three-photon microscope?</p>



<p><strong>BP:</strong> I’m going to build whatever people ask me to build. We’ve done a lot of 2p microscopes, but we’ve also built wide-field microscopes, we’ve built a mesoSPIM, we’re working on a microscope for in-situ sequencing, I’ve helped people with LabView coding. Whatever it is that people ask me, if I have time to do it and it sounds interesting, I’ll do it. And I wouldn’t be surprised if a three-photon microscope is on the cards at some point. We haven’t done it yet, but if someone asks, I’ll be happy to build one.</p>



<p><strong>PR:</strong> So, even if I gave you a lot of money to make you build a 3D AOD-based two-photon scanning microscope, would you give it a try? I’ve heard that it is extremely challenging to make this run stably.</p>



<p><strong>BP: </strong>I would certainly try it – and get the right people involved. I was actually a co-author on an AOD paper some ten years ago with people from Angus Silver’s lab. AOD systems are a little bit finicky, but with the right person, with the right project, with the right collaborators on board, I don’t see why someone who wants an AOD system shouldn’t attempt to build one. I’m sure that some of these teething problems that any new technology always has will be ironed out over the next few years</p>



<p><strong>PR: </strong>So you’re quite optimistic about the future role of AOD scopes for two-photon microscopy?</p>



<p><strong>BP: </strong>For the right applications – yes.</p>



<p><strong>PR: </strong>As we mentioned you also provide your service in order to help your customers save costs. If a lab really wants to save money, would you recommend to buy a fixed-wavelength laser for two-photon microscopy? I’m also not sure whether there are already some 920 nanometer lasers around …</p>



<p><strong>BP: </strong>There are now a few manufacturers that build fixed wavelength 920 nanometer lasers, and if someone says, all I’m going to do with this microscope for the next three or four years is GCaMP imaging and I just want to have a workhorse for that, then that’s certainly a good option. If it’s a young lab that only has a single two-photon microscope in the lab, and they don’t know exactly what sort of projects might come along next year and what sort of dyes they might be using next year, then it’s a bit of a risk to bet all your money on a single wavelength. This is probably more something for labs that have another two-photon with a tunable laser, where they can do experiments in the red or where they can explore other dyes that aren’t excitable at 920 nm.</p>



<p><strong>PR:</strong> Do you have examples for companies which sell fixed wavelength lasers at 920 nm?</p>



<p><strong>BP:</strong> Coherent are selling one now, the <a href="https://www.coherent.com/lasers/laser/axon">Axon 920</a>; Spark Lasers have <a href="https://spark-lasers.com/compact-femtosecond-laser-biophotonics-alcor/">a few options</a> for 920 nm; there’s Menlo, a company in Munich that sells the <a href="https://www.menlosystems.com/products/femtosecond-lasers-and-amplifiers/ylmo930/">Ylmo-930</a>; Toptica have a <a href="https://www.toptica.com/products/psfs-fiber-lasers/femtofiber-ultra/femtofiber-ultra-920/">920 model</a>, also <a href="https://www.nktphotonics.com/lasers-fibers/product-category/koheras-single-frequency-lasers/">NKT Photonics</a> – there’s quite a few around now. I haven’t actually tried any of them yet, but it’s certainly going in a direction where we’ll be seeing these more often in the field.</p>



<p><strong>PR:</strong> Another technical question – you mentioned it already: what’s your opinion on multiplexed acquisition? Will it remain a niche product like the mesoscopes, or do you think it will become much more standard?</p>



<p><strong>BP:</strong> Again it depends completely on your application … if you want to image two areas simultaneously without having to jump between them – whether that’s on a mesoscope where you image two different brain areas that are millimeters apart, or whether you want to image a single neuron and you want to image soma and spines both with very zoomed-in resolutions, but without having to jump between them – then multiplexed acquisition can be the right technique. If you don’t have the right question for multiplexed acquisition, then there’s no point getting it. All of these things are only useful in a very particular context that depends on the scientific question that you want to answer.</p>



<p><strong>PR:</strong> I always thought that multiplexed acquisition might be particularly difficult to implement because it’s not only challenging in terms of hardware and optical alignment, but also the software to disentangle the two multiplexed photon streams is not trivial. I was thinking that this combination of both hardware and software challenges might be a bottleneck which prevents many people from doing it?</p>



<p><strong>BP: </strong>Well… you can also de-multiplex the channels in hardware using an analog system. Spencer Smith and Jeffrey Stirman used a nice system in their 2016 Nature Biotechnology paper with a wide FOV (<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27347754/">paper link</a>), where they actually had an analog photon-counting system and then just acquired with a standard data acquisition system. They didn’t need to change anything in software because all the photon counting was done in the analog domain. But now, with these gigahertz data acquisition systems, you can acquire the data fast enough, get the laser timing and then assign different acquisition time bins to different channels. Scanimage can do that now, so it’s not really a challenge any more.</p>



<p><strong>PR:</strong> Do you have an opinion about the new <a href="https://vidriotechnologies.com/vdaq/">vDAQ</a> system of Scanimage? I think it’s not based on National Instruments hardware any more.</p>



<p><strong>BP:</strong> We’ve built a couple of microscopes with those systems, and they seem very nice, very user-friendly. There’s no obvious downside, although I haven’t had a chance to really observe them over the same time periods as I have with National Instruments for over 20 years. But I have very high hopes for these systems, and we’re using them as standard now. The only situation where we’re not using them at the moment is when we have to count photons, because the data acquisition speed is currently 125 MHz max on the vDAQ. But there will be a new vDAQ version coming out later this year, with high-speed acquisition that will then be suitable for photon counting.</p>



<p class="has-blue-color has-text-color" style="font-size: 23px; line-height: 1.1;">“I had to fly to Okinawa to build a microscope, but I didn’t know whether my toolkit would be there, too.”</p>



<p><strong>PR:</strong> I see. Maybe, to finish up, some fun questions… or maybe not so much fun, let’s see. During your time at INSS, what was your most challenging project?</p>



<p><strong>BP: </strong>One of the first microscopes we built was in Okinawa, Japan. Shipping all the microscope parts to Okinawa was a bit of a challenge. Three of the four boxes arrived without problem, but the box with my toolkit didn’t arrive and was completely lost for about a week or so. UPS didn’t know where it was. They had scanned it in Tokyo, but then lost track of it and had absolutely no idea where it was. I had to fly to Okinawa to build a microscope, but I didn’t know whether my toolkit would be there, too. I had lots of spare parts in the toolkit, and all sorts of specialist tools that were difficult to replace in the shortness of time. That was a challenge to my otherwise unshakable optimism … In the end, the toolkit did arrive and everything was fine; I built the microscope, no problem with that. But then I needed to ship the toolkit back, and UPS kept cancelling the booking and no one on the customer service hotline knew why. We eventually shipped it back with Fedex. It was all very annoying, and I then decided to get a shipping agent who’s now managing all of our shipping for us, and he’s been brilliant.</p>



<p><strong>PR: </strong>Okay, this sounds like a rough start…</p>



<p><strong>BP: </strong>Yes … having these useful conversations with UPS customer service … It makes my blood boil just thinking about it.</p>



<p><strong>PR: </strong>What was the most expensive device you destroyed by accident?</p>



<p><strong>BP: </strong>I don’t really know, I don’t remember.</p>



<p><strong>PR:</strong> You never destroyed an objective?</p>



<p><strong>BP:</strong> I never destroyed an objective, never destroyed a laser; I’ve destroyed scan mirrors, ETLs, stuff like that, probably a few other items in that price range. But I move on from that pretty quickly. I always think of it as a tuition fee that I have to pay, and then I forget about the incident. But the knowledge of what not to do stays with me.</p>



<p><strong>PR: </strong>Which skill do you wish you have learned earlier that would be of use for your current job?</p>



<p><strong>BP: </strong>Hm, all of them! I would love to have university degrees in electronic engineering and optical physics and project management, computer science, business administration, and applied math. Almost every technical thing or business thing that you could learn at a university would be in some way useful to my current job. But I also have to be realistic about how much I can do with the available time. These disciplines have crossed my path sort of superficially, and I’ve picked up what I can. I wish I had a really solid foundation in all of them, but I have to live with my limitations.</p>



<p><strong>PR: </strong>This sounds quite modest, given your expertise in so many domains… if you had to pick one, what would you learn if you had one year for that?</p>



<p><strong>BP:</strong> Probably math. I’d really like to go back to undergraduate level math and learn all the foundations properly.</p>



<p><strong>PR:</strong> From your long experience in research and as a consultant, what kind of advice would you give to students or postdocs who want to learn the skills which are needed to understand a microscope or, more generally, to set up experiments?</p>



<p><strong>BP:</strong> You just have to start, just go and do it. If you want to set up a microscope, go online, google “how to set up a microscope”, and then click your way to the websites where you can find how to set up a microscope. Maybe someone recommends to go to a course, maybe someone recommends a particular Youtube video. You’ll find all the resources that you need. This is such a great time to be alive, because you can find everything that you need online. You can apply for courses like the CSHL course that we discussed about, or TENSS, or numerous other imaging courses. If you don’t get into any of those courses, you can still learn it all online and just start building. A lot of people now offer very simple 3D-printed parts to set up basic optics and teach yourself the skills. You don’t even have to wait until you’re a student or a postdoc, you can do that as a little school project when you’re 12 years old, because all the learning resources are online.</p>



<p class="has-blue-color has-text-color" style="font-size: 23px; line-height: 1.1;">“I would recommend to stop thinking about a career. I would recommend to think about just getting better and better at whatever it is that floats your boat.”</p>



<p><strong>PR: </strong>So you would encourage self-learning, because that’s the way to learn what you have learned yourself?</p>



<p><strong>BP: </strong>It’s one way that works for me. Other people have different working styles, and your own working style emerges when you start doing something.</p>



<p><strong>PR:</strong> What would be your advice for young scientists like PhD candidates or postdocs who think about a career like yours?</p>



<p><strong>BP: </strong>I would recommend to stop thinking about a career. I would recommend to think about just getting better and better at whatever it is that floats your boat; if you work more like an artist or an artisan and just focus on improving whatever your chosen art or your chosen craft is, then you’re going to get good at it, and then you’ll enjoy doing it. And if you keep an open mind, intriguing opportunities will pop up. And if you pursue these opportunities whenever they present themselves, then you’ll end up with the very tortuous career trajectory that I have, that doesn’t seem to make any obvious sense from outside. But for me, internally, it had a very natural flow. You’re obviously also going to need a massive amount of good luck; but I don’t really have any advice on how to get lucky.</p>



<p>On a side note, for anyone who’s considering starting their own business or doing something on their own, there’s an old blog post written by a banjo player called Danny Barnes. He writes about how to make a living by playing music (<a href="https://dannybarnes.com/blog/how-make-living-playing-music">https://dannybarnes.com/blog/how-make-living-playing-music</a>), and while the blog post is ostensibly about music, there’s a lot of advice that applies to any self-employed person, not just musicians; and also not just to self-employed people, it applies to anyone who is in some way in a largely self-directed job – which I guess is the case for most scientists. There are a few paragraphs in there that are more specific to music, but I think it’s just a very good read on how you want to conduct business and life with other people and make a living from it.</p>



<p><strong>PR:</strong> I’m curious, and I’ll check it out! … I think it has become obvious by now that you’re a big music aficionado. On Twitter, you describe yourself, among others, as ‘Bluegrass Dobroist’. Could you explain this to somebody without any clue, like myself?</p>



<p><strong>BP: </strong>A Dobro is an American instrument, it’s like an acoustic guitar that has an aluminium resonator cone built into the body. Originally, it was invented to make a normal guitar louder, a bit like a speaker cone that picks up the vibrations from the strings and projects them outward. The Dobro was invented in the 1920s to make the guitar <em>a little bit</em> louder to be heard over orchestras, and it was kind of popular for a few years, until someone invented an electric guitar that you could just very easily make <em>a lot</em> louder, and then the Dobro fell into obscurity. It’s played in a lap style, and you’re not fretting the strings with your fingers like on a normal guitar, but you use a steel bar that slides up and down the strings.</p>



<p><em>(Since I did not fully understand the following explanations, he pulls out a Dobro and simply shows to me via video how it works to play a Dobro.)</em></p>



<p><strong>PR: </strong>And what is the meaning of ‘bluegrass’?</p>



<p><strong>BP:</strong> Bluegrass originally comes from the American state of Kentucky. Kentucky has a certain type of grass that has a sort of a blue appearance, and that’s why Kentucky is called the bluegrass state. There was a band in the 1940s that came from Kentucky; the band leader was called Bill Monroe and this band was called the Bluegrass Boys. Bill Monroe and the Bluegrass Boys played a very new and unique style of acoustic country music, and then other people started copying that style, and eventually because of the name of the band the style became known as Bluegrass music, and that evolved into a whole genre of music. Now, there’s tons of bluegrass bands, and bluegrass music, bluegrass festivals, and there’s a Grammy for bluegrass music. So, from this one band in the 1940s a very huge branch of music has emerged.</p>

<p><strong>PR: </strong>Interesting, I didn’t know that.</p>



<p><strong>BP:</strong> I’ll be most happy to talk a lot more about bluegrass music all day long! I love it – I’ve been really involved in this scene for the last 12 years or so, going to festivals almost every weekend – obviously not now with the pandemic, and generally a little less since I started the company and since we had a baby two years ago. I’ve got a lot of other things to do now, but I’m still very much connected to the whole music scene and to the guys in the band and all that. Sometimes during the time when I worked at Scientifica, I was playing five, six, seven gigs a month even though I was living here in East Sussex and drove an hour and a half or two hours into London after work to play gigs and come back during the night to be back at Scientifica in the morning…</p>



<p><strong>PR: </strong>At the end, is there anything else you want to share?</p>



<p><strong>BP: </strong>I want to give a quick shout-out to my team, Angelos, Eleanor, Mark and Simon, who are just a massive pleasure to work with.<br />Other than that, if people want any sort of clarification on the things that I’ve mentioned, if people are thinking about transitioning from academia to industry and there are questions popping up, send me an email or hit me up on twitter and I’ll be quite happy to answer questions and give advice!</p>



<p><strong>PR: </strong>Thank you. I think you gave already a lot of good advice here!</p>



<p><strong>BP:</strong> I’m glad to hear that.</p>



<p><strong>PR: </strong>Thank you very much.</p>

<p>Calcium imaging is a powerful method to record from many neurons simultaneously. But what do the recorded signals really mean?</p>



<p>This question can only be properly addressed by experiments which record both calcium signals and action potentials from the same neuron (ground truth recordings). These recordings are technically quite challenging. So we assembled several existing ground truth datasets, and in addition recorded ground truth datasets ourselves, totaling &gt;200 neuronal recordings.</p>



<p>This blog blog posts contains raw movies together with recorded action potentials (black; also turn on your speakers for the spikes!) and the recorded ΔF/F of the calcium recording (blue). These ground truth data are a very direct way for everybody into calcium imaging to get an intuition about what is really going on. (Scroll down if you want to see recordings in zebrafish!)</p>

<figure class="wp-block-video wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-videopress"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">

<p>Something completely different: recording from a pyramidal neuron in Ca3 with <strong>R-CaMP1.07</strong>, virally induced, recorded by Stefano Carta, from <a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.31.272450v1">Rupprecht et al., bioRxiv, 2020</a>. What appears as single events are actually bursts of 5-15 action potentials with inter-spike-intervals of &lt;6 ms.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-video wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-videopress"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">

</div></figure>



<p>A recording that I performed myself in adult zebrafish, in a subpart of the homolog of olfactory cortex (aDp) with <strong>GCaMP6f</strong>, tg(neuroD), in <a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.31.272450v1">Rupprecht et al., bioRxiv, 2020</a>. Around second 20, it is visible that even a single action potential can be seen in the calcium signal. However,this was not always the case in other neurons that I recorded from the same brain region.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-video wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-videopress"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">

</div></figure>



<p>Again a recording that I did in adult zebrafish, in the dorsal part of the dorsal telencephalon with <strong>GCaMP6f</strong>, tg(neuroD), in<a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.31.272450v1"> Rupprecht et al., bioRxiv, 2020</a>.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-video wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-videopress"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">

</div></figure>



<p>What can you do if you want to detect single isolated action potentials with calcium imaging? GCaMP, due to its sigmoid non-linearity, is by often a bad choice and will be strongly biased towards bursts. Synthetic indicators, however, are very linear in the low-calcium regime. – This is a recording that I did myself in adult zebrafish, in a subpart of the homolog of olfactory cortex (pDp) with the injected synthetic indicator <strong>OGB-1</strong> in <a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.31.272450v1">Rupprecht et al., bioRxiv, 2020</a>. Although the temporal resolution of the calcium recording is rather low, the indicator clearly responds to single action potentials. As another asset, the indicator not only fills the cytoplasm of the neuron in a ring-like shape, which makes neuropil-contamination much less of an issue compared to GCaMPs.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-video wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-videopress"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">

</div></figure>



<p>Another recording that I performed in adult zebrafish, in a subpart of the homolog of olfactory cortex (pDp) with the injected synthetic indicator <strong>Cal-520</strong> in <a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.31.272450v1">Rupprecht et al., bioRxiv, 2020</a>. This indicator is much more sensitive compared to OGB-1, but also diffuses less well after bolus injection. – These two minutes of recording only contain 4 spikes (this brain region really is into low firing rates in general), but you can clearly see all of them. If this were a GCaMP recording, you would probably see only a flat line throughout the entire recording.</p>
