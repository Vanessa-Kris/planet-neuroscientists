              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/black-holes-mass-measure-new-technique-accretion-disk">Measuring a black hole’s mass isn’t easy. A new technique could change that</a></h4>

              
                <p>An actively feeding black hole surrounds itself with a disk of hot gas and dust that flickers like a campfire. Astronomers have now found that monitoring changes in those flickers can reveal something that is notoriously hard to measure: the behemoth’s heft.</p>



<p>“It’s a new way to weigh black holes,” says astronomer Colin Burke of the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. What’s more, the method could be used on <a href="https://science.sciencemag.org/lookup/doi/10.1126/science.abg9933">any astrophysical object with an accretion disk</a>, and may even help find elusive midsize black holes, researchers report in the Aug. 13 <em>Science</em>.</p>



<p>It’s not easy to measure a black hole’s mass. For one thing, the dark behemoths are notoriously difficult to see. But sometimes black holes reveal themselves when they eat. As gas and dust falls into a black hole, the material organizes into a disk that is heated to white-hot temperatures and can, in some cases, outshine all the stars in the galaxy combined.</p>



<p>Measuring the black hole’s diameter can reveal its mass using Einstein’s general theory of relativity. But only the globe-spanning Event Horizon Telescope has made this sort of measurement, and <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/m87-black-hole-image-best-mass-estimates-star-motion">for only one black hole</a> so far (<em>SN: 4/22/19</em>). Other black holes have been weighed via observations of their influence on the material around them, but that takes a lot of data and doesn’t work for every supermassive black hole.</p>





<p>So, looking for another way, Burke and colleagues turned to accretion disks. Astronomers aren’t sure how black holes’ disks flicker, but it seems like small changes in light combine to brighten or dim the entire disk over a given span of time. Previous research had hinted that the time it takes a disk to fade, brighten and fade again is related to the mass of its central black hole. But those claims were controversial, and didn’t cover the full range of black hole masses, Burke says.</p>



<p>So he and colleagues assembled observations of 67 actively feeding black holes with known masses. The behemoths spanned sizes from 10,000 to 10 billion solar masses. For the smallest of these black holes, the flickers changed on timescales of hours to weeks. Supermassive black holes with masses between 100 million and 10 billion solar masses flickered more slowly, every few hundred days.</p>



<p>“That gives us a hint that, okay, if this relation holds for small supermassive black holes and big ones, maybe it’s sort of a universal feature,” Burke says.</p>



<p>Out of curiosity, the team also looked at white dwarfs, the compact corpses of stars like the sun, which are some of the smallest objects to sport consistent accretion disks. Those white dwarfs followed the same relationship between flicker speed and mass.</p>



<p>The analyzed black holes didn’t cover the entire possible range of masses. Known black holes that are from about 100 to 100,000 times the mass of the sun are rare. There are several potential candidates, but <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/physics-gravitational-waves-midsize-black-hole-collision-ligo-virgo">only one has been confirmed</a> (<em>SN: 9/2/20</em>). In the future, the relationship between disk flickers and black hole mass could tell astronomers exactly what kind of disk flickers to look for to help bring these midsize beasts out of hiding, if they’re there to be found, Burke says.</p>



<p>Astrophysicist Vivienne Baldassare of Washington State University in Pullman studies black holes in dwarf galaxies, which may preserve some of the properties of ancient black holes that formed in the early universe. One of the biggest challenges in her work is measuring black hole masses. The study’s “super exciting results … will have a large impact for my research, and I expect many others as well,” she says.</p>



<p>The method offers a simpler way to weigh black holes than any previous technique, Burke says — but not necessarily a faster one. More massive black holes, for example, would need hundreds of days, or possibly years, of observations to reveal their masses.</p>



<p>Upcoming observatories are already planning to take that kind of data. The <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/new-observatory-named-after-dark-matter-pioneer-vera-rubin">Vera C. Rubin Observatory</a> is expected to start observing the entire sky every night beginning in 2022 or 2023 (<em>SN: 1/10/20</em>). Once the telescope has been running long enough, the observations needed to weigh black holes “will fall out for free” from the Rubin Observatory data, Burke says. “We’re already building it. We may as well do this.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/statistical-significance-p-value-null-hypothesis-origins">How the strange idea of ‘statistical significance’ was born</a></h4>

              
                <p>In the middle of the 20<sup>th</sup> century, the field of psychology had a problem. In the wake of the Manhattan Project and in the early days of the space race, the so-called “hard sciences” were producing tangible, highly publicized results. Psychologists and other social scientists looked on enviously. Their results were squishy, and difficult to quantify.</p>



<p>Psychologists in particular wanted a statistical skeleton key to unlock true experimental insights. It was an unrealistic burden to place on statistics, but the longing for a mathematical seal of approval burned hot. So psychology textbook writers and publishers created one, and called it <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/odds-are-its-wrong">statistical significance</a>.</p>



<p>By calculating just one number from their experimental results, called a P value, researchers could now deem those results “statistically significant.” That was all it took to claim — even if mistakenly — that an interesting and powerful effect had been demonstrated. The idea took off, and soon legions of researchers were reporting statistically significant results.</p>



<p>To make matters worse, psychology journals began to publish papers only if they reported statistically significant findings, prompting a surprisingly large number of investigators to massage their data — <a href="https://www.cmu.edu/dietrich/sds/docs/loewenstein/MeasPrevalQuestTruthTelling.pdf">either by gaming the system or cheating</a> — to get below the P value of 0.05 that granted that status. Inevitably, bogus findings and chance associations began to proliferate.</p>





<p>As editor of a journal called <em>Memory &amp; Cognition</em> from 1993 to 1997, Geoffrey Loftus of the University of Washington tried valiantly to yank psychologists out of their statistical rut. At the start of his tenure, Loftus published an editorial telling researchers to <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/closed-thinking">stop mindlessly calculating whether experimental results are statistically significant or not</a> (<em>SN: 5/16/13</em>). That common practice impeded scientific progress, he warned.</p>



<p>Keep it simple, Loftus advised. Remember that a picture is worth a thousand reckonings of statistical significance. In that spirit, he recommended reporting straightforward averages to compare groups of volunteers in a psychology experiment. Graphs could show whether individuals’ scores covered a broad range or clumped around the average, enabling a calculation of whether the average score would likelychange a little or a lot in a repeat study. In this way, researchers could evaluate, say, whether volunteers scored better on a difficult math test if first allowed to write about their thoughts and feelings for 10 minutes, versus sitting quietly for 10 minutes.</p>



<p>Loftus might as well have tried to lasso a runaway train. Most researchers kept right on touting the statistical significance of their results.</p>



<p>“Significance testing is all about how the world isn’t and says nothing about how the world is,” Loftus later said when looking back on his attempt to change how psychologists do research.</p>



<p>What’s remarkable is not only that mid-20<sup>th</sup> century psychology textbook writers and publishers <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/null-science">fabricated significance testing out of a mishmash of conflicting statistical techniques</a> (<em>SN: 6/7/97</em>). It’s also that their weird creation was embraced by many other disciplines over the next few decades. It didn’t matter that eminent statisticians and psychologists panned significance testing from the start. The concocted calculation proved highly popular in social sciences, biomedical and epidemiological research, neuroscience and biological anthropology.</p>



<p>A human hunger for certainty fueled that academic movement. Lacking unifying theories to frame testable predictions, scientists studying the mind and other human-related topics rallied around a statistical routine. Repeating the procedure provided a false but comforting sense of having tapped into the truth. Known formally as null hypothesis significance testing, the practice assumes a null hypothesis (no difference, or no correlation, between experimental groups on measures of interest) and then rejects that hypothesis if the P value for observed data came out to less than 5 percent (P &lt; .05).</p>



<div class="wp-block-sciencenews-content-sidebar alignright">
<h3>P value</h3>



<p>A P value is the probability of an observed (or more extreme) result arising only from chance.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="680" height="400" src="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/100-psych_spotlight-null_inline_p-value_mobile.png" alt="illustration of a bell curve with the p value segment shaded in blue" class="wp-image-3102483" srcset="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/100-psych_spotlight-null_inline_p-value_mobile.png 680w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/100-psych_spotlight-null_inline_p-value_mobile-651x383.png 651w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/100-psych_spotlight-null_inline_p-value_mobile-316x186.png 316w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><figcaption><span class="credit wp-credit-3102483">E.

</div>



<p>The problem is that slavishly performing this procedure absolves researchers of having to develop theories that make specific, falsifiable predictions — the fundamental elements of good science. Rejecting a null hypothesis doesn’t tell an investigator anything new. It only creates an opportunity to speculate about why an effect might have occurred. Statistically significant results are rarely used as a launching pad for testing alternative explanations of those findings.</p>



<p>Psychologist Gerd Gigerenzer, director of the Harding Risk Literacy Center in Berlin, considers it more accurate to call null hypothesis significance testing “the null ritual.”</p>



<p>Here’s an example of the null ritual in action. A <a href="https://science.sciencemag.org/content/336/6080/493">2012 study published in <em>Science</em></a> concluded that volunteers’ level of religious belief declined after viewing pictures of Auguste Rodin’s statue <em>The Thinker</em>, in line with an idea that mental reflection causes people to question their faith in supernatural entities. In this study, the null hypothesis predicted that volunteers’ religious beliefs would stay the same, on average, after seeing <em>The Thinker</em>, assuming that the famous sculpture has no effect on viewers’ spiritual convictions.</p>



<p>The null ritual dictated that the researchers calculate whether group differences in religious beliefs before and after perusing the statue would have occurred by chance in no more than one out of 20 trials, or no more than 5 percent of the time. That’s what P &lt; .05 means. By meeting that threshold, the result was tagged statistically significant, and not likely due to mere chance.</p>



<p>If that sounds reasonable, hold on. Even after meeting an arbitrary 5 percent threshold for statistical significance, the study hadn’t demonstrated that statue viewers were losing their religion. Researchers could only conjecture about why that might be the case, because the null ritual forced them to assume that there is no effect. Talk about running in circles.</p>



<p>To top it off, an independent redo of <em>The Thinker</em> study found no statistically significant decline in religious beliefs among viewers of the pensive statue. Frequent failures to confirm statistically significant results have triggered <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/blog/science-the-public/replication-crisis-psychology-science-studies-statistics">a crisis of confidence in sciences wedded to the null ritual</a> (<em>SN: 8/27/18</em>).</p>



<p>Some journals now require investigators to fork over their research designs and experimental data before submitting research papers for peer review. The goal is to discourage data fudging and to up the odds of publishing results that can be confirmed by other researchers.</p>

</div>



<p>But the real problem lies in the null ritual itself, Gigerenzer says. In the early 20<sup>th</sup> century, and without ever calculating the statistical significance of anything, Wolfgang Köhler developed Gestalt laws of perception, Jean Piaget formulated a theory of how thinking develops in children and Ivan Pavlov discovered principles of classical conditioning. Those pioneering scientists typically studied one or a handful of individuals using the types of simple statistics endorsed decades later by Loftus.</p>



<p>From 1940 to 1955, psychologists concerned with demonstrating the practical value of their field, especially to educators, sought an objective tool for telling real from chance findings. Rather than acknowledging that conflicting statistical approaches existed, psychology textbook writers and publishers mashed those methods into the one-size-fits-all P value, Gigerenzer says.</p>



<p>One inspiration for the null ritual came from British statistician Ronald Fisher. Starting in the 1930s, Fisher devised a type of significance testing to analyze the likelihood of a null hypothesis, which a researcher could propose as either an effect or no effect. Fisher wanted to calculate the exact statistical significance associated with, say, using a particular fertilizer deemed promising for crop yields.</p>



<p>Around the same time, statisticians Jerzy Neyman and Egon Pearson argued that testing a single null hypothesis is useless. Instead, they insisted on determining which of at least two alternative hypotheses best explained experimental results. Neyman and Pearson calculated an experiment’s probability of accepting a hypothesis that’s actually true, something left unexamined in Fisher’s null hypothesis test.</p>



<p>Psychologists’ null ritual folded elements of both approaches into a confusing hodge-podge. Researchers often don’t realize that statistically significant results don’t prove that a true effect has been discovered.</p>



<p>And about half of surveyed medical, biological and psychological researchers <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-019-00857-9">wrongly assume that finding no statistical significance in a study means that there was no actual effect</a>. A closer analysis may reveal findings consistent with a real effect, especially when the original results fell just short of the arbitrary cutoff for statistical significance.</p>

</div>



<p>It’s well past time to dump the null ritual, says psychologist and applied statistician Richard Morey of Cardiff University, Wales. <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/2515245918776023">Researchers need to focus on developing theories of mind and behavior that lead to testable predictions.</a> In that brave new scientific world, investigators will choose which of many statistical tools best suits their needs. “Statistics offer ways to figure out how to doubt what you’re seeing,” Morey says.</p>



<p>There’s no doubt that the illusion of finding truth in statistical significance still appeals to researchers in many fields. Morey hopes that, perhaps within a few decades, the null ritual’s reign of errors will end.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/indigenous-people-philippines-denisovan-dna-genetics">An Indigenous people in the Philippines have the most Denisovan DNA</a></h4>

              
                <p>Denisovans are an elusive bunch, known mainly from ancient DNA samples and traces of that DNA that the ancient hominids shared when they interbred with <em>Homo sapiens</em>. They left their biggest genetic imprint on people who now live in Southeast Asian islands, nearby Papua New Guinea and Australia. Genetic evidence now shows that a Philippine Negrito ethnic group has inherited the most Denisovan ancestry of all. Indigenous people known as the Ayta Magbukon get around 5 percent of their DNA from Denisovans, a new study finds.</p>



<p>This finding fits an evolutionary scenario in which two or more Stone Age Denisovan populations independently reached various Southeast Asian islands, including the Philippines and a landmass that consisted of what’s now Papua New Guinea, Australia and Tasmania. Exact arrival dates are unknown, but <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/ancient-stone-tools-raise-tantalizing-questions-over-who-colonized-sulawesi">nearly 200,000-year-old stone tools found on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi</a> may have been made by Denisovans (<em>SN</em>: 1/13/16). <em>H. sapiens</em> groups that started arriving around 50,000 years ago or more then interbred with resident Denisovans.</p>



<p>Evolutionary geneticists Maximilian Larena and Mattias Jakobsson, both at Uppsala University in Sweden, and their team describe the new evidence August 12 in <em>Current Biology</em>.</p>



<p>Even as the complexities of ancient interbreeding in Southeast Asia become clearer, Denisovans remain a mysterious crowd. “It’s unclear how the different Denisovan groups on the mainland and on Southeast Asian islands were related [to each other] and how genetically diverse they were,” Jakobsson says.</p>





<p>Papua New Guinea highlanders — estimated to carry close to 4 percent Denisovan DNA in the new study — were previously thought to be the modern record holders for Denisovan ancestry. But the Ayta Magbukon display roughly 30 percent to 40 percent more Denisovan ancestry than Papua New Guinea highlanders and Indigenous Australians, Jakobsson says. That calculation accounts for recent mating of East Asians with Philippine Negrito groups, including the Ayta Magbukon, that diluted Denisovan inheritance to varying degrees.</p>



<p>Genetic analyses suggest that Ayta Magbukon people retain slightly more Denisovan ancestry than other Philippine Negrito groups due to having mated less often with East Asian migrants to the island around 2,281 years ago, the scientists say. Their genetic analyses compared ancient DNA from Denisovans and Neandertals with that of 1,107 individuals from 118 ethnic groups in the Philippines, including 25 Negrito populations. Comparisons were then made to previously collected DNA from present-day Papua New Guinea highlanders and Indigenous Australians.</p>



<p>The new report underscores that “still today there are populations that have not been fully genetically described and that Denisovans were geographically widespread,” says paleogeneticist Cosimo Posth of the University of Tübingen in Germany, who was not part of the new research.</p>



<p>But it’s too early to say whether Stone Age <em>Homo</em> fossils found on Southeast Asian islands come from Denisovans, populations that interbred with Denisovans or other <em>Homo</em> lineages, Posth says. Only DNA extracted from those fossils can resolve that issue, he adds. Unfortunately, ancient DNA preserves poorly in fossils from tropical climates.</p>



<p>Only a handful of confirmed Denisovan fossils exist. Those consist of <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/new-dates-narrow-down-when-denisovans-and-neandertals-crossed-paths">a few fragmentary specimens from a Siberian cave</a> where Denisovans lived from around 300,000 to 50,000 years ago (<em>SN: 1/30/19</em>), and a roughly 160,000-year-old <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/jawbone-shows-denisovans-lived-tibetan-plateau-long-humans">partial jaw found on the Tibetan Plateau</a> (<em>SN: 5/1/19</em>).&nbsp;</p>



<p>Fossils from the Philippines <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/new-hominid-species-homo-luzonensis-philippines">initially classed as <em>H. luzonensis</em></a>, dating to 50,000 years ago or more (<em>SN: 4/10/19</em>), might actually represent Denisovans. But a lack of consensus on what Denisovans looked like leaves the evolutionary identity of those fossils uncertain.</p>



<p>Larena and Jakobsson’s findings “further increase my suspicions that Denisovan fossils are hiding in plain sight” among previously excavated discoveries on Southeast Asian islands, says population geneticist João Teixeira of the University of Adelaide in Australia, who did not participate in the new study.</p>



<p>Denisovans may have genetically encompassed <em>H. luzonensis</em> and two other fossil hominids found on different Southeast Asian islands, <em>H. floresiensis</em> on Flores and <em>H. erectus</em> on Java, Teixeira suspects. <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/hobbit-history-gets-new-preface"><em>H. floresiensis</em>, or hobbits</a>, survived from at least 100,000 years ago to around 60,000 years ago (<em>SN: 6/8/16</em>). <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/homo-erectus-last-known-appearance-roughly-117000-years-ago"><em>H. erectus </em>arrived on Java</a> about 1.6 million years ago and died out between 117,000 and 108,000 years ago (<em>SN: 12/18/19</em>).</p>



<p>Geographic ancestry patterns on Southeastern Asian islands and in Australia suggest that this region was <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41559-021-01408-0">settled by a genetically distinct Denisovan population</a> from southern parts of mainland East Asia, Teixeira and his colleagues reported in the May <em>Nature Ecology &amp; Evolution</em>.</p>

                <p><em>By </em><a href="http://emilyoliviareynolds.com/">Emily Reynolds</a></p>



<p>The impact of technology on young people is an oft-debated topic in the media. Is <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2018/10/02/researchers-find-the-most-plausible-cause-of-wellbeing-decline-in-youth-is-increased-screen-time/">increased screen time</a> having a serious impact on their mental health? Or have we <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2019/05/31/link-between-teens-time-on-digital-devices-and-lower-wellbeing-is-too-small-to-merit-substantial-scientific-discussion/">over-exaggerated</a> the level of risk young people face due to their use of tech?</p>



<p>According to a <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41599-021-00863-1">new study</a>, published in <em>Humanities and Social Sciences Communications, </em>we could be asking the wrong questions. A team led by Nastasia Griffioen at Radboud University Nijmegen suggests that rather than looking at screen time in a binary way, researchers should explore the nuances of smartphone use: <em>how</em> young people are using their phones, rather than the fact they’re using them at all.</p>



<span id="more-43220"></span>



<p>The original aim of the study was to look at how stress regulation affected social media use. First, 114 participants aged 18 to 25 filled in measures of depression, anxiety, emotional regulation, self-compassion and rejection sensitivity. They were then split into two conditions: a stress condition, in which they had to give a recorded presentation for five minutes, and a control condition, in which they simply viewed and rated two presentations.</p>



<p>Participants were then asked to wait in the experiment room for ten minutes and told not to move from their seat; meanwhile, and unknown to the participants, a camera recorded their activity, looking closely at phone use. Upon the researcher’s return, participants were shown the video and were asked to share their motivations, thoughts and feelings each time they had started a new activity on their phones.</p>



<p>Due to methodological issues, the stress manipulation didn’t seem to work. But the team still found some interesting results regarding smartphone use overall. Phone use was widespread: 96.5% of participants used their phone at some point during the ten minutes, 80% of whom started using their phone as soon as the experimenter left the room. Just over 48% used their smartphone for the full ten minutes. <em>How</em> participants used their phones, however, was more varied. Some used mainly social media, while others engaged in online shopping, read articles, or played games; similarly, some participants switched between apps only once, while others switched up to twenty one times.</p>



<p>Only a quarter of participants said they felt bad during an activity they’d engaged in on their phones, and these negative feelings were not normally related to social interactions: for instance, some participants reported feeling generally bored, while one reported feeling bad after finding out that their football club had lost. While some reported feeling bad because of what someone else had posted or sent them, these experiences were in the minority. Nearly 94% of participants also reported having positive feelings while using their phone — laughing at a funny post, feeling curious about something, or simply enjoying looking through their feeds. Messaging apps were associated with the highest level of positive feeling.</p>



<p>The team also looked at active vs. passive use of phones. While some participants made a conscious choice not to use their smartphone at all, passive phone use was most closely associated with social media, which participants largely engaged with out of habit or boredom. However, there wasn’t much evidence that participants’ feelings were different during passive vs active use.</p>



<p>With such disparate phone activities established, the team then turned to the mental health symptoms measured at the start of the study. Adults with high levels of depression symptoms reported fewer positive feelings associated with using social media, and in particular with passive use of social media — but at the same time were also more likely to use Facebook. This was also the case for those with higher levels of anxiety. Participants with higher levels of sensitivity to rejection were less likely to spend time messaging, and less likely to experience positive feelings while messaging, using social media, and scrolling. On the other hand, those with higher levels of self-compassion were more likely to experience positive feelings, more likely to use a varied number of social media platforms, and showed higher engagement in non-smartphone based activities.</p>



<p>So while phone use was fairly ubiquitous, it’s clear that participants differed in terms of the activities they chose to do, how they felt about doing them, and the individual differences that impacted both. The team argues that the fact young people use their phones in many different ways and for many different reasons essentially renders catch-all questions about “screen time” useless. Because the study was time-limited and conducted in a lab, future research could also look at how smartphones are used in daily life.</p>



<p>As the team says, the results suggest a “complex, dynamic, and variable picture” when it comes to phone use and its impact. Looking more carefully at these individual differences, rather than simply condemning phone use completely, could provide more useful insights and more useful interventions for those kinds of use that do cause harm.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/birds-steal-animal-hair-fur-nest-new-word-video">Scientists have a new word for birds stealing animal hair</a></h4>

              
                <p>Some tiny birds take bold risks to gather a beakful of hair for their nests. Titmice have been spotted dive-bombing cats, alighting on dozing predators’ backs and plucking strands of hair from people’s heads. Now, there’s a term for the unusual behavior: kleptotrichy.</p>



<p>Derived from the Greek words for “to steal” and “hair,” kleptotrichy has rarely been described by scientists, but <a href="https://esajournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ecy.3501?af=R">dozens of YouTube videos capture the behavior</a>, researchers report online July 27 in <em>Ecology. </em>Titmice — and one chickadee — have been caught on video tugging hair from dogs, cats, humans, raccoons and even a porcupine.<strong></strong></p>



<p>“Citizen scientists, bird watchers and people with dogs knew this behavior much more than the scientists themselves,” says animal behaviorist Mark Hauber of the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. “Popular observations precede science rather than the other way around, which is a valid way to do science.”<strong></strong></p>

</div><figcaption>Scientists counting birds in an Illinois state park in May 2020 spotted a tufted titmouse plucking fur off a dozing, unbothered raccoon. The team dubbed the behavior “kleptotrichy” after a search of the scientific literature and amateur videos on YouTube turned up more than 100 instances of hair thievery by birds.</figcaption></figure>



<p>Witnessing a bird steal hair from a mammal in the wild is what first inspired Hauber’s colleague, ecologist Henry Pollock, to dig deeper. While counting birds in an Illinois state park in May 2020, Pollock and colleagues spotted a tufted titmouse pluck fur from a sleeping raccoon. “I was like, ‘Wow, I’ve never seen anything like that,” says Pollock, also of the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.</p>





<p>In South America, palm swifts snatch feathers from flying pigeons and parrots — a behavior already known as kleptoptily. Searching through the scientific literature, Hauber, Pollock and colleagues found only 11 anecdotes of birds stealing hair from live mammals. While most published accounts involve titmice in North America, at least five other bird species get in on the action. Researchers have seen an American crow harvest hair from a cow and a red-winged starling in Africa peck a small antelope called a klipspringer. In Australia, three honeyeater bird species steal fur from koalas.</p>





<p>Meanwhile, a YouTube search by the team turned up 99 videos of tufted titmice, a mountain chickadee and a black-crested titmouse plucking hair from mammals. The latter two bird species had not previously been identified as hair thieves in the scientific literature.</p>



<p>Scientists generally assume that birds gather hair for their nests in low-risk ways, relying on carcasses or stray fluff shed into the wind. “Plucking hairs from raccoons, which are common avian nest predators, suggests that it&#8217;s obviously worth it to get that hair,” Pollock says.</p>



<p>Hair-harvesting species tend to live in colder climates, so those birds probably prize hair’s insulating properties, the team says. Some birds might also spruce up their nests with mammal hair to <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/stinking-decorations-protect-nests">confuse would-be predators</a> and parasites (<em>SN:</em> <em>8/28/01</em>).</p>

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/~r/plos/Blog/~3/5J69ZGH_lVw/">A peek into the PLOS ONE review process</a></h4>

              
                <!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/loose.dtd">
<html><body><p><strong>Author</strong><br>Emily Chenette, Editor-in-Chief, PLOS ONE<br><br>When <em>PLOS ONE</em> launched nearly 15 years ago, it was the very first multidisciplinary journal that aimed to publish all ethically and methodologically rigorous research, regardless of the novelty of the findings or the perceived impact of the work. We were then &ndash; as we are now &ndash; immensely gratified by the strong community support for the journal and for accessible Open Access publishing, and were <a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2011/01/welcome-nature-seriously-2/">delighted</a> when other publishers took notice and launched Open Access &ldquo;megajournals&rdquo; of their own.&nbsp;</p>



<p>When I meet <em>PLOS ONE</em> authors I&rsquo;ll often ask why they chose to submit to us and what they think sets the journal apart from its cousins. Often authors will mention the speed of the review process, or our publication criteria, or the calibre of our editorial board members. Some authors say that PLOS&rsquo; mission and strong support for Open Science was a major draw. Occasionally, they&rsquo;ll say that they&rsquo;ve been encouraged to submit by a member of our editorial board or another past author.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But what about the quality of the review process? After all, administering high-quality peer review is a fundamental role for any scientific journal. The process at <em>PLOS ONE</em> is quite special, especially given the volume of submissions we receive. I&rsquo;m really happy to have this opportunity to share a bit more about our <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/s/editorial-and-peer-review-process">review process</a> and why I think it makes <em>PLOS ONE</em> unique.</p>



<h3>Detailed initial editorial checks</h3>



<p>All new manuscript submissions &ndash; and we receive &gt;100 of them every day &ndash; are subjected to an initial technical check to ensure that the submission is complete. Once manuscripts pass this stage, they are individually assigned to and assessed by our team of subject matter experts, who have expertise in the study topic. The assessment at this stage focuses on <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/s/criteria-for-publication#loc-1">scope</a>, whether the <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/s/criteria-for-publication#loc-3">methods are presented in sufficient detail</a> for review purposes, the overall <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/s/criteria-for-publication#loc-5">quality of the language</a> and whether the research was conducted with <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/s/criteria-for-publication#loc-6">appropriate ethical approval and meets high ethical standards</a>. Manuscripts that do not comply with our standards are desk rejected with a detailed letter explaining why the submission does not meet our publication criteria (we reject around 20% of submissions without review).&nbsp;</p>



<h3>Robust editorial and peer review</h3>



<p>Manuscripts that pass these initial screening steps are then sent on to members of our <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/static/editorial-board">Editorial Board</a>, who administer the peer-review process. Academic Editors assess the manuscript against our <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/s/criteria-for-publication">seven publication criteria</a>, paying particular attention to whether the conclusions are supported by the data provided, and we work closely with our board to ensure that this process is as efficient as possible. For example, when an Academic Editor agrees to handle a new manuscript submission, we share any concerns that have arisen during our initial screening steps (such as missing details of animal care) and provide information on community standards that might be helpful in the review process (such as STRENDA guidelines for enzymology studies and PRISMA for systematic reviews). Additionally, if a manuscript has been posted as a preprint, we share the preprint link with the Academic Editor so that they can consider any comments that have been made. We also partner with initiatives like <a href="https://www.reviewcommons.org/">Review Commons</a> and <a href="https://peercommunityin.org/">Peer Community In</a> to weave pre-submission commenting into the review process and further streamline decision making.&nbsp;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-gallery columns-1 is-cropped"><ul class="blocks-gallery-grid"><li class="blocks-gallery-item"><figure><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="342" src="https://theplosblog.plos.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2021/08/ONE-peer-review-process-2-1024x342.png" alt="" data-id="19265" data-full-url="https://theplosblog.plos.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2021/08/ONE-peer-review-process-2.png" data-link="https://theplosblog.plos.org/?attachment_id=19265" class="wp-image-19265" srcset="https://theplosblog.plos.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2021/08/ONE-peer-review-process-2-1024x342.png 1024w, https://theplosblog.plos.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2021/08/ONE-peer-review-process-2-300x100.png 300w, https://theplosblog.plos.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2021/08/ONE-peer-review-process-2-768x256.png 768w, https://theplosblog.plos.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2021/08/ONE-peer-review-process-2-1536x513.png 1536w, https://theplosblog.plos.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2021/08/ONE-peer-review-process-2-2048x684.png 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></figure></li></ul><figcaption class="blocks-gallery-caption">The PLOS ONE peer review process.</figcaption></figure>



<p>Once the full complement of required feedback has been received, the Academic Editor issues a decision. We ask Academic Editors to justify their decisions in detail, which is especially important when there is discordance between the reviewers&rsquo; comments. Rejection decisions are sent straight to the authors at this point. However, if the Academic Editor submits a revision decision, additional journal requirements are added to the decision letter before it is transmitted to the authors. This can include reminding authors to <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/s/materials-software-and-code-sharing">deposit their software or code</a>, provide their original <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/s/figures#loc-blot-and-gel-reporting-requirements">gel or blot data</a>, amend their <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/s/competing-interests">competing interests</a> or <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/s/disclosure-of-funding-sources">financial declaration</a> disclosures, or to indicate <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/s/data-availability">where their data are available or can be obtained</a>. The complete decision letter is then sent to the authors, after which the Academic Editor and reviewer(s) also receive a copy.&nbsp;</p>



<h3>Aligning with our publication criteria and policies</h3>



<p>On resubmission, the revised manuscript undergoes another technical check to ensure that the rebuttal letter is present and that concerns around ethics, language or reporting that were identified by our subject matter experts have been addressed. The revised manuscript is then sent back to the original Academic Editor, who determines whether it can be accepted for publication or requires further review. When the Academic Editor is satisfied that the manuscript meets <em>PLOS ONE</em>&rsquo;s publication criteria, it is provisionally accepted for publication.&nbsp;</p>



<p>At this stage, we perform one final series of checks, including ensuring that there are no copyright concerns, all relevant data have been made available, and that no apparent conflicts of interest arose during review. We also ask authors whether they would like to publish the <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/s/editorial-and-peer-review-process#loc-peer-review-history">peer review history</a> of their submission. Once these checks are complete, the manuscript is formally accepted for publication, typeset, and published.&nbsp;</p>



<h3>Partnering with our Editorial Board for efficient, rigorous review&nbsp;</h3>



<p>What makes this process at <em>PLOS ONE</em> unique? In my experience, the partnership between our subject matter experts and Academic Editors, and the way we work together to focus on rigor rather than glamor, is rare. It&rsquo;s all the more incredible given that we collaborate to assess tens of thousands of submissions every year. This relationship aims to make peer review as smooth and rapid for authors as possible, while still ensuring that only robust, reproducible science is published. Partnering with our board in such a way also ensures that the publication process is efficient, that authors understand the basis for editorial decisions, and that all publishable research is open and accessible to all. We are grateful to our Academic Editors and to the reviewers they recruit for making this process work so well.</p>



<p>We will continue to seek ways to refine and streamline the review process at <em>PLOS ONE</em> in a way that best serves the needs of our communities. Please do <a href="mailto:plosone@plos.org">get in touch</a> if you have feedback on the review process or ideas for how we can further improve it.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/covid-colds-common-respiratory-diseases-kids-return-school">Colds and other common respiratory diseases might surge as kids return to school</a></h4>

              
                <p class="has-drop-cap" style="font-size:20px">As U.S. schools resume in-person learning this fall, parents and administrators may have to deal with more outbreaks of colds and other seasonal respiratory illnesses than usual. If so, these outbreaks aren’t likely to be especially dangerous for school-age children, but could be problematic for traditionally more vulnerable younger siblings or elderly relatives, experts say. And because the symptoms of these illnesses often mirror those of COVID-19, it could make having kids back in the classroom — and keeping them there — that much more challenging.</p>



<p>Respiratory viruses, which cause common colds and the flu, typically circulate in colder months. But last year’s cold-and-flu season was practically nonexistent. Some cold-causing viruses, such as rhinoviruses and enteroviruses, kept spreading, though at reduced levels. Influenza and respiratory syncytial virus, or RSV, however, were held to <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/covid-19-coronavirus-precautions-flu-respiratory-infections-cases">historically low levels</a>, an unintended effect of COVID-19 pandemic precautions such as border closings, wearing masks and social distancing (<em>SN: 2/2/21</em>). Other respiratory pathogens that cause cold-like symptoms, such as adenoviruses and parainfluenza viruses, <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34292924/">also had very mild seasons last winter</a>, researchers with the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention report July 23 in<em> Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report</em>.</p>



<p>“There&#8217;s been a huge, huge change during the COVID pandemic in the circulation of what we think of as the commonplace respiratory viruses and the seasonal respiratory viruses,” says Ellen Foxman, an immunologist at Yale School of Medicine. RSV and flu “have virtually disappeared during the COVID pandemic, almost certainly because of the mitigation measures.”</p>

<h3>COVID-19: Back to school</h3>





<p>This story is one in a series looking at what to expect as U.S. children return to in-person school.</p>



<ul><li><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coronavirus-covid-kids-schools-reopening-cases">Schools are reopening. COVID-19 is still here. What does that mean for kids?</a></li><li><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/covid-school-kids-lost-education-learning-gap">What kids lost when COVID-19 upended school</a></li><li><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coronavirus-covid-kids-school-return-parents-questions">6 answers to parents’ COVID-19 questions as kids return to school</a></li></ul>
</div>



<p>But, worryingly, that absence has created a larger-than-usual population of people vulnerable to these common respiratory viruses. When people don’t get sick with the viruses for a year or two, immunity to them wanes. That makes those people, including school-age kids, more likely to get sick in the coming months.</p>



<p>Keeping COVID-19 precautions such as wearing masks in place could help keep these other respiratory viruses from surging. Without those precautions this coming winter, experts think high rates of RSV and other common respiratory viruses are probable.</p>



<p>A string of endless colds would be annoying and possibly disruptive to schooling, given that these viruses often cause symptoms like runny noses and cough, similar to some COVID-19 symptoms. That means kids might have to miss school while waiting for COVID-19 test results. What’s more, these kids can pass these infections on to very young or elderly family members.</p>



<p>“The kids are going to go to school, they&#8217;ll bring it home to the family and the younger children,” says Ian Barr, a virologist at the World Health Organization’s Collaborating Centre for Reference and Research on Influenza at the Doherty Institute in Melbourne, Australia. Those family members “are the ones who will … end up with the symptomatic and in some cases, serious infections.”</p>



<p>Influenza and RSV are the most serious seasonal respiratory viruses, especially for the very young and the elderly. The CDC estimates that <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/rsv/research/us-surveillance.html">RSV typically puts about 58,000 children under age 5 in the hospital each year</a> and is the most common cause of pneumonia in children under a year old. It also hospitalizes more than 177,000 adults 65 and older. Influenza viruses typically kill around 36,000 people a year in the United States and hospitalize almost half a million, the CDC estimates.</p>

<p>With the pandemic-induced lull in these diseases, there is now a larger population of people vulnerable to RSV and that has led to unusual, <a href="https://www.eurosurveillance.org/content/10.2807/1560-7917.ES.2021.26.29.2100186#html_fulltext">off-season outbreaks</a> of the illness in some places, researchers report July 22 in <em>Eurosurveillance</em>. Multiple states in Australia saw off-season RSV peaks in summer months that were even larger than traditional winter peaks. In Western Australia, the normal cold-weather peak for RSV is a little over 40 detections per week in the middle of July. But in 2020, there was no cold-weather peak. RSV infections stayed low until the warm months, and then <a href="https://academic.oup.com/cid/advance-article/doi/10.1093/cid/ciaa1906/6140790">peaked at over 100 detections a week in December</a>, researchers reported in February in <em>Clinical Infectious Diseases</em>.</p>



<p>In the United States, <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/surveillance/nrevss/rsv/natl-trend.html">detections of RSV have been mostly rising since spring</a>, according to the CDC’s National Respiratory and Enteric Virus Surveillance System. In late March, there were about 100 detections a week in the surveillance system. In the week ending July 24, there were more than 3,100 weekly detections. That’s still far below a normal RSV season; for example, cases peaked at 24,280 detections a week in December of 2019. But the timing is the thing, experts say. “It&#8217;s rare for most of these respiratory diseases to be circulating in summer,” says Barr, a coauthor of the <em>Eurosurveillance</em> study.</p>



<div class="wp-block-sciencenews-content-sidebar">
<h3>On the rise</h3>



<p>Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is usually a winter virus that affects primarily young children and the elderly. It all but disappeared earlier during the pandemic. But the five-week moving average of RSV detections in the United States shows that cases of RSV have been rising as governments and businesses lift COVID-19 precautions. The most recent weeks’ detections may increase as more data comes in.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Short and sharp summer outbreaks of RSV — like those seen in Western Australia in December of 2020 — seem to lead to a lower surge later, Barr says. But places where levels of RSV and other seasonal respiratory viruses stay low through the warm months, could turn into hot spots in the fall and winter with a larger-than-normal season.</p>



<p>There is one big exception to that prediction: If the coronavirus is widespread during winter, “it may still keep these other viruses low,” says Richard Webby, a virologist at St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital in Memphis, Tenn.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>&nbsp;If so, that wouldn’t just be because of COVID-19 precautions left in place to help control the coronavirus. At play would also be a phenomenon called <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/covid19-coronavirus-flu-season-fall">viral interference</a> — when one respiratory virus dampens the spread of other viruses (<em>SN: 9/18/20</em>). There are two ways that this can happen: by sickening people and having them stay home — removing them from the population than can be infected at a given school or workplace — or by directly priming infected individuals’ immune system to fight off other viral infections.</p>



<p>“When one virus is there, there&#8217;s a heightened state of general antiviral defenses” in the body, Foxman says. “So you would predict that for a certain … period after somebody has one viral infection, they may be more resistant to getting another viral infection.” Still, this scenario would mean relatively high levels of coronavirus cases in the country — not exactly something to hope for.</p>

<p>“If [I] had to guess what was going to happen, [I&#8217;d say] that some of these other respiratory diseases are going to be more of a problem than influenza when your kids go back to school,” Barr says. “The parainfluenzas, the adenoviruses, RSV — these sorts of viruses are more likely to circulate than influenza.”</p>



<p>That’s partly because the flu vaccine exists, which can help lessen influenza outbreaks. And it’s partly because of the way that the flu spreads and evolves as it moves around the world, experts say, and how that spread seems to be more affected by border closures and reduced travel than other respiratory viruses. Less travel around the world in the last two years has prevented influenza epidemics from spreading out of countries to other places, and the flu remains at very low levels worldwide.</p>



<p>Ultimately, “it&#8217;s a little hard to predict what&#8217;s going to happen, because we have never had this kind of disruption before in the transmission of these viruses,” Foxman says. “But of course, it&#8217;s very interesting to follow it and important to see what happens, because we&#8217;re going to learn a lot.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/brain-ripples-rat-memory-reduce-sugar-levels-metabolism">Ripples in rats’ brains tied to memory may also reduce sugar levels</a></h4>

              
                <p>Ripples of nerve cell activity that lock in memories may have an unexpected job outside of the brain: Dropping blood sugar levels in the body.</p>



<p>Just after a burst of ripples in a rat’s hippocampus, sugar levels elsewhere in the body dipped, new experiments show. The curveball results, published August 11 in <em>Nature</em>, suggest that certain types of <a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-021-03811-w">brain activity and metabolism are entwined</a> in surprising and mysterious ways.</p>



<p>“This paper represents a significant advance in our understanding of how the hippocampus modulates metabolism,” says Elizabeth Gould, a neuroscientist at Princeton University who wasn’t involved in the study.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Neural shudders called sharp-wave ripples zig and zag in the brains of people as they learn new things and <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/electrodes-show-glimpse-memories-emerging-brain">draw memories back up</a> (<em>SN: 8/19/19</em>). Ripples also feature prominently during deep sleep. Sleeping mammals, birds and even lizards known as Australian dragons have these bursts of electrical activity. Sharp-wave ripples are thought to accompany the neural work of transforming short-term knowledge into long-term memories.</p>





<p>Neuroscientist David Tingley wondered whether these signals might also change something outside of the brain. Working with neuroscientist György Buzsáki at New York University Grossman School of Medicine and colleagues, Tingley, now at Harvard University, fitted continuous glucose monitors onto the backs of rats. These devices, used by people with diabetes to keep tabs on sugar levels in the fluid around cells, provide a good proxy for blood sugar levels. The researchers simultaneously measured the rats’ brain waves with electrodes implanted in the hippocampus, a brain structure that plays a key role in memory.</p>



<p>Every so often, electrodes picked up clusters of ripples. About 10 minutes after a bout of ripples, sugar levels in the body fell, the glucose monitors showed. “We saw these dips in the second rat, and the third rat, and the fourth rat,” says Buzsáki. “It was super consistent. The magnitude is small but [the dips] are always there.”</p>



<p>To see if this connection between the ripples and the sugar dips was mere coincidence, the researchers forced nerve cells in the hippocampus to fire in response to light, creating artificial ripples. Sure enough, after a bout of these forced ripples, the rats’ sugar levels dropped.</p>



<p>What’s more, when the researchers jammed the ripples’ downstream signals with a drug that quiets nerve cells in a brain area called the lateral septum, sugar levels did not drop. That suggests these ripples send signals that ping-pong through the brain and ultimately tell the body to reduce its sugar.</p>



<p>“All of this was very surprising,” says Jan Born, a neuroscientist who studies metabolism at the University of Tübingen in Germany. You might expect a busy brain at work to call for more energy, in the form of sugar, not less, says Born, who cowrote a <a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/d41586-021-02122-4">commentary</a> on the new paper in the same issue of <em>Nature</em>. &nbsp;But here, “the brain says to the body, ‘We don’t need so much energy, so go down with your glucose levels.’ Why?” says Born, “It’s difficult to see its function.”</p>



<p>Buzsáki wonders whether these ripples might have evolved initially to aid in metabolism. “They were useful for the body first,” he speculates. As time passed, ripples may have been pulled in on other jobs, such as memory storage.</p>



<p>If this newfound link between brain waves and metabolism exists in people, it might suggest a way to influence sugar levels by tweaking ripples, Buzsáki says, an idea that might prove useful for people with diabetes or other metabolic problems. The hippocampus is deep in the brain, but its activity can be altered via magnetic or electrical jolts to easier-to-reach brain areas. Still, changing ripples for metabolic reasons is a far-off idea, Buzsáki cautions.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/psychology-behavior-human-mind-cognition-mental-health">Psychology has struggled for a century to make sense of the mind</a></h4>

              
                <p class="has-drop-cap" style="font-size:20px">One of the most infamous psychology experiments ever conducted involved a carefully planned form of child abuse. The study rested on a simple scheme that would never get approved or funded today. In 1920, two researchers reported that they had repeatedly startled an unsuspecting infant, who came to be known as Little Albert, to see if he could be conditioned like Pavlov’s dogs.</p>



<p>Psychologist John Watson of Johns Hopkins University and his graduate student Rosalie Rayner viewed their laboratory fearfest as a step toward strengthening a branch of natural science able to predict and control the behavior of people and other animals.</p>



<p>At first, the 9-month-old boy, identified as Albert B., sat placidly when the researchers placed a white rat in front of him. In tests two months later, one researcher presented the rodent, and just as the child brought his hand to pet it, the other scientist stood behind Albert and clanged a metal rod with a hammer. Their goal: to see if a child could be conditioned to associate an emotionally neutral white rat with a scary noise, just as Russian physiologist Ivan Pavlov had trained dogs to associate the meaningless clicks of a metronome with the joy of being fed.</p>



<p>Pavlov’s dogs slobbered at the mere sound of a metronome. Likewise, <a href="http://www.appstate.edu/~steelekm/classes/psy3214/Documents/Watson&amp;Rayner1920.pdf">Little Albert eventually cried and recoiled at the mere sight of a white rat</a>. The boy’s conditioned fear wasn’t confined to rodents. He got upset when presented with other furry things — a rabbit, a dog, a fur coat and a Santa Claus mask with a fuzzy beard.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="alignleft size-full"><img loading="lazy" width="680" height="375" src="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/081421_BB_sn100psych_little-albert.jpg" alt="baby Little Albert crying with a rabbit" class="wp-image-3102427" srcset="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/081421_BB_sn100psych_little-albert.jpg 680w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/081421_BB_sn100psych_little-albert-330x182.jpg 330w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><figcaption><span class="caption wp-caption-3102427">In a questionable experiment published in 1920, researchers conditioned an infant nicknamed Little Albert to fear various furry animals and objects.</span><span class="credit wp-credit-3102427">J.B. Watson</span></figcaption></figure></div>



<p>Crucial details of the Little Albert experiment remain unclear or in dispute, such as who the child was, whether he had any neurological conditions and why the boy was removed from the experiment, possibly by his mother, before the researchers could attempt to reverse his learned fears. Also uncertain is whether he experienced any long-term effects of his experience.</p>



<p>Although experimental psychology originated in Germany in 1879, Watson’s notorious study foreshadowed a messy, contentious approach to the “science of us” that has played out over the last 100 years. Warring scientific tribes armed with clashing assumptions about how people think and behave have struggled for dominance in psychology and other social sciences. Some have achieved great influence and popularity, at least for a while. Others have toiled in relative obscurity. Competing tribes have rarely joined forces to develop or integrate theories about how we think or why we do what we do; such efforts don’t attract much attention.</p>



<p>But Watson, who had a second career as a successful advertising executive, knew how to grab the spotlight. He pioneered a field dubbed behaviorism, the study of people’s external reactions to specific sensations and situations. Only behavior counted in Watson’s science. Unobservable thoughts didn’t concern him.</p>

<p>Even as behaviorism took center stage — Watson wrote a best-selling book on how to raise children based on conditioning principles — some psychologists addressed mental life. American psychologist Edward Tolman concluded that rats learned the spatial layout of mazes by constructing <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/problems-brain-maps">a “cognitive map” of their surroundings</a> (<em>SN: 3/29/47, p. 199</em>). Beginning in the 1910s, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/significance-gestalt">Gestalt psychologists</a> studied how we perceive wholes differently than the sum of their parts, such as, depending on your perspective, seeing either a goblet or the profiles of two faces in the foreground of a drawing (<em>SN: 5/18/29, p. 306</em>).</p>



<p>And starting at the turn of the 20th century, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/freud-still-active">Sigmund Freud, the founder of psychoanalysis,</a> exerted a major influence on the treatment of psychological ailments through his writings on topics such as unconscious conflicts, neuroses and psychoses (<em>SN: 7/9/27, p. 21</em>). Freudian clinicians guided the drafting of the American Psychiatric Association’s first official classification system for mental disorders. Later editions of the psychiatric “bible” dropped Freudian concepts as unscientific — he had based his ideas on analyses of himself and his patients, not on lab studies.</p>



<p>Shortly after Freud’s intellectual star rose, so did that of Harvard University psychologist B.F. Skinner, who could trace his academic lineage back to Watson’s behaviorism. By placing rats and pigeons in conditioning chambers known as Skinner boxes, Skinner studied how the timing and rate of rewards or punishments affect animals’ ability to learn new behaviors. He found, for instance, that regular rewards speed up learning, whereas intermittent rewards produce behavior that’s hard to extinguish in the lab. He also stirred up controversy by calling free will an illusion and imagining a utopian society in which communities doled out rewards to produce well-behaved citizens.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/psychologist-social-engineer">Skinner’s ideas, and behaviorism in general, lost favor by the late 1960s</a> (<em>SN: 9/11/71, p. 166</em>). Scientists began to entertain the idea that computations, or statistical calculations, in the brain might enable thinking.</p>

<p>At the same time, some psychologists suspected that human judgments relied on faulty mental shortcuts rather than computer-like data crunching. Research on allegedly rampant flaws in how people make decisions individually and in social situations shot to prominence in the 1970s and remains popular today. In the last few decades, an opposing line of research has reported that instead, people render good judgments by using simple rules of thumb tailored to relevant situations.</p>



<p>Starting in the 1990s, the science of us branched out in new directions. Progress has been made in studying how emotional problems develop over decades, how people in non-Western cultures think and why deaths linked to despair have steadily risen in the United States. Scientific attention has also been redirected to finding new, more precise ways to define mental disorders.</p>



<p>No unified theory of mind and behavior unites these projects. For now, as social psychologists William Swann of the University of Texas at Austin and Jolanda Jetten of the University of Queensland in Australia <a href="https://labs.la.utexas.edu/swann/files/2017/05/swannjetten-1.pdf">wrote in 2017</a>, perhaps scientists should broaden their perspectives to “witness the numerous striking and ingenious ways that the human spirit asserts itself.”</p>





<h4>Revolution and rationality</h4>



<p>Today’s focus on studying people’s thoughts and feelings as well as their behaviors can be traced to a “cognitive revolution” that began in the mid-20th century.</p>



<p>The rise of increasingly powerful computers motivated the idea that complex programs in the brain guide “information processing” so that we can make sense of the world. These neural programs, or sets of formal rules, provide frameworks for remembering what we’ve done, learning a native language and performing other mental feats, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/brain-machine">a new breed of cognitive and computer scientists argued</a> (<em>SN: 11/26/88, p. 345</em>).</p>



<p>Economists adapted the cognitive science approach to their own needs. They were already convinced that individuals calculate costs and benefits of every transaction in the most self-serving ways possible — or should do so but can’t due to human mental limitations. Financial theorists bought into the latter argument and began creating cost-benefit formulas for investing money that are far too complex for anyone to think up, much less calculate, on their own. Economist Harry Markowitz won the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences in 1990 for his set of mathematical rules, introduced in 1952, to allocate an investor’s money to different assets, with more cash going to better and safer bets.</p>



<p>But in the 1970s, psychologists began conducting studies documenting that people rarely think according to rational rules of logic beloved by economists. Psychologists Daniel Kahneman of Princeton University, who received the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences in 2002, and Amos Tversky of Stanford University founded that area of research, at first called heuristics (meaning mental shortcuts) and biases.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="alignleft size-full"><img loading="lazy" width="680" height="473" src="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/081421_BB_sn100psych_kahneman-tversky.jpg" alt="Amos Tversky and Daniel Kahneman" class="wp-image-3102423" srcset="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/081421_BB_sn100psych_kahneman-tversky.jpg 680w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/081421_BB_sn100psych_kahneman-tversky-551x383.jpg 551w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/081421_BB_sn100psych_kahneman-tversky-647x450.jpg 647w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/081421_BB_sn100psych_kahneman-tversky-267x186.jpg 267w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><figcaption><span class="caption wp-caption-3102423">Amos Tversky (left) and Daniel Kahneman (right) started a popular line of research in the 1970s aimed at uncovering ways in which human decisions go awry.</span><span class="credit wp-credit-3102423">Barbara Tversky</span></figcaption></figure></div>



<p>Kahneman and Tversky popularized the notion that decision makers rely on highly fallible mental shortcuts that can have dire consequences. For instance, people bet themselves into bankruptcy at blackjack tables based on what they easily remember — big winners — rather than on the vast majority of losers. University of Chicago economist Richard Thaler applied that idea to the study of financial behavior in the 1980s. He was awarded the <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/richard-thaler-nobel-economic-sciences">2017 Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences</a> for his contributions to the field of behavioral economics, which incorporated previous heuristics and biases research. Thaler has championed the practice of nudging, in which government and private institutions find ways to prod people to make decisions deemed to be in their best interest.</p>



<p>Better to nudge, behavioral economists argue, than to leave people to their potentially disastrous mental shortcuts. Nudges have been used, for instance, to enroll employees automatically in retirement savings plans unless they opt out. That tactic is aimed at preventing delays in saving money during prime work years that lead to financial troubles later in life.</p>



<p>Another nudge tactic attempts to reduce overeating of sweets and other unhealthy foods, and perhaps rising obesity rates as well, by redesigning cafeterias and grocery stores so that vegetables and other nutritious foods are easiest to see and reach.</p>



<p>As nudging gained in popularity, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/rational-mind-designs">Kahneman and Tversky’s research also stimulated the growth of an opposing research camp</a>, founded in the 1990s by psychologist Gerd Gigerenzer, now director of the Harding Center for Risk Literacy at the University of Potsdam in Germany (<em>SN: 7/13/96, p. 24</em>).</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="alignright size-full"><img loading="lazy" width="680" height="453" src="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/081421_BB_sn100psych_Gigerenzer.jpg" alt="Gerd Gigerenzer" class="wp-image-3102415" srcset="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/081421_BB_sn100psych_Gigerenzer.jpg 680w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/081421_BB_sn100psych_Gigerenzer-575x383.jpg 575w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/081421_BB_sn100psych_Gigerenzer-675x450.jpg 675w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/081421_BB_sn100psych_Gigerenzer-279x186.jpg 279w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><figcaption><span class="caption wp-caption-3102415">In the 1990s, psychologist Gerd Gigerenzer and colleagues launched investigations of simple but powerful decision-making shortcuts.</span><span class="credit wp-credit-3102415">Franz Johann Morgenbesser/Flickr (<a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/2.0/">CC BY-SA 2.0</a>)

<p>Gigerenzer and colleagues study simple rules of thumb that, when geared toward crucial cues in real-world situations, work remarkably well for decision making. Their approach builds on ideas on decision making in organizations that won economist Herbert Simon the <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/nobel-prizes-research-impact">1978 Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences</a> (<em>SN: 10/21/78, p. 277</em>).</p>



<p>In the real world, people typically possess limited information and have little time to make decisions, Gigerenzer argues. Precise risks can’t be known in advance or calculated based on what’s happened in the past because many interacting factors can trigger unexpected events in, for example, one’s life or the world economy. Amid so much uncertainty, simple but powerful decision tactics can outperform massive number-crunching operations such as Markowitz’s investment formula. Using 40 years of U.S. stock market data to predict future returns, one study found that simply distributing money evenly among either 25 or 50 stocks usually <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/simple-heresy">yielded more money</a> than 14 complex investment strategies, including Markowitz’s (<em>SN Online: 5/20/11</em>).</p>



<p>Unlike Markowitz’s procedure, dividing funds equally among diverse buys spreads out investment risks without mistaking accidental and random financial patterns in the past for good bets.</p>



<p>Gigerenzer and other investigators of powerful rules of thumb emphasize public education in statistical literacy and effective thinking strategies over nudging schemes. Intended effects of nudges are often weak and short-lived, they contend. Unintended effects can also occur, such as regrets over having accepted the standard investment rate in a company’s savings plan because it turns out to be too low for one’s retirement needs. “Nudging people without educating them means infantilizing the public,” Gigerenzer wrote in 2015.</p>



<h4>Moved to do harm</h4>



<p>As studies of irrational decision making took off around 50 years ago, so did a field of research with especially troubling implications. Social psychologists put volunteers into experimental situations that, in their view, exposed a human weakness for following the crowd and obeying authority. With memories of the Nazi campaign to exterminate Europe’s Jews still fresh, two such experiments became famous for showing the apparent ease with which people abide by heinous orders and abuse power.</p>



<p>First, Yale psychologist Stanley Milgram reported in 1963 that 65 percent of volunteers obeyed an experimenter’s demands to deliver what they thought were increasingly powerful and possibly lethal electric shocks to an unseen person — who was actually working with Milgram — as punishments for erring on word-recall tests. This widely publicized finding appeared to <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/shocking-obedience-found-children">unveil a frightening willingness of average folks to carry out the commands of evil authorities</a> (<em>SN: 8/20/77, p. 117</em>).</p>



<p>A disturbing follow-up to Milgram’s work was the 1971 Stanford Prison Experiment, which psychologist Philip Zimbardo halted after six days due to escalating chaos among participants. Male college students assigned to play guards in a simulated prison had increasingly abused mock prisoners, stripping them naked and denying them food. Student “prisoners” became withdrawn and depressed.</p>



<p>Zimbardo argued that extreme social situations, such as assuming the role of a prison guard, will overwhelm self-control. Even mild-mannered college kids can get harsh when clad in guards’ uniforms and turned loose on their imprisoned peers, he said.</p>

<p>Milgram’s and Zimbardo’s projects contained human drama and conflict that had widespread, and long-lasting, public appeal. A 1976 made-for-television movie based on Milgram’s experiment, titled <em>The Tenth Level</em>, starred William Shatner. A 2010 movie inspired by the Stanford Prison Experiment, simply called <em>The Experiment</em>, starred Academy Award winners Adrien Brody and Forest Whitaker.</p>



<p>Despite the lasting cultural impact of the obedience-to-authority and prison experiments, some researchers have questioned Milgram’s and Zimbardo’s conclusions. Milgram conducted 23 obedience experiments, although only one was publicized. Overall, volunteers usually delivered the harshest shocks when encouraged to identify with Milgram’s scientific mission to understand human behavior. No one followed the experimenter’s order, “You have no other choice, you must go on.”</p>



<div class="wp-block-sciencenews-content-sidebar alignright">
<h3>Schools of thought</h3>



<p>Researchers have taken a variety of often conflicting, sometimes complementary approaches to the study of human thought and behavior.</p>



<p><strong>1899 — Freudian psychoanalysis</strong>: Study and treatment of unconscious mental conflicts</p>



<p><strong>1912 —</strong> <strong>Gestalt psychology:</strong> Study of unified perceptions rather than their parts</p>



<p><strong>1913 —</strong> <strong>John Watson’s behaviorism:</strong> Study of the prediction and control of human behavior</p>



<p><strong>1938 —</strong> <strong>B.F. Skinner’s behaviorism</strong>: Study of behaviors conditioned by rewards and punishments</p>



<p><strong>1956 —</strong> <strong>Cognitive revolution</strong>: Study of the mind using artificial intelligence and computers</p>



<p><strong>1971 —</strong> <strong>Heuristics and biases (Kahneman and Tversky)</strong>: Study of irrational, mistaken decisions</p>



<p><strong>1999 —</strong> <strong>Ecological rationality (Gigerenzer)</strong>: Study of how mental shortcuts work in the right settings</p>



<p><strong>2010 —</strong> <strong>WEIRD/cross-cultural movement</strong>: Study of how people outside Western cultures think</p>
</div>



<p>Indeed, people who follow orders to harm others are most likely to do so because they identify with a collective cause that morally justifies their actions, argued psychologists S. Alexander Haslam of the University of Queensland and Stephen Reicher of the University of St. Andrews in Scotland 40 years after the famous obedience study. Rather than blindly following orders, Milgram’s volunteers cooperated with an experimenter when they viewed participation as scientifically important — even if, as many later told Milgram, they didn’t want to deliver shocks and felt bad after doing so.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/rwanda-genocide-psychology-murder">Data from the 1994 ethnic genocide in the African nation of Rwanda</a> supported that revised take on Milgram’s experiment (<em>SN: 8/19/17, p. 22</em>). In a 100-day span, members of Rwanda’s majority Hutu population killed roughly 800,000 ethnic Tutsis. Researchers who later examined Rwandan government data on genocide perpetrators estimated that only about 20 percent of Hutu men and a much smaller percentage of Hutu women seriously injured or killed at least one person during the bloody episode. Most Hutus rejected pressure from political and community leaders to join the slaughter.</p>



<p>Neither did Zimbardo’s prisoners and guards passively accept their assigned roles. Prisoners at first challenged and rebelled against guards. When prisoners learned from Zimbardo that they would have to forfeit any money they’d already earned if they left before the experiment ended, their solidarity plummeted, and the guards crushed their resistance. Still, a majority of guards refused to wield power tyrannically, favoring tough-but-fair or friendly tactics.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/err-human">In a second prison experiment conducted by Haslam and Reicher in 2001</a>, guards were allowed to develop their own prison rules rather than being told to make prisoners feel powerless, as Zimbardo had done. In a rapid chain of events, conflict broke out between one set of guards and prisoners who formed a communal group that shared power and another with guards and prisoners who wanted to institute authoritarian rule. Morale in the communal group sank rapidly. Haslam stopped the experiment after eight days. “It’s the breakdown of groups and resulting sense of powerlessness that creates the conditions under which tyranny can triumph,” Haslam concluded.</p>



<p>Milgram’s and Zimbardo’s experiments set the stage for further research alleging that people can’t control certain harmful attitudes and behaviors. A test of the speed with which individuals identify positive or negative words and images after being shown white and Black faces has become popular as a marker of unconscious racial bias. Some investigators regard that test as a window into hidden prejudice — and implicit bias training has become common in many workplaces. But other scientists have questioned whether it truly taps into underlying bigotry. Likewise, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/showdown-sex-gap">stereotype threat</a>, the idea that people automatically act consistently with negative beliefs about their race, sex or other traits when subtly reminded of those stereotypes, has also attracted academic supporters and critics.</p>



<div class="wp-block-sciencenews-content-sidebar">
<h3>Diagnostic disarray</h3>



<p>From 1952 to 1980, the <em>Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</em>, or DSM, divided mental ailments into less-debilitating neuroses and more-debilitating psychoses. Other conditions were grouped under psychosomatic illnesses, personality disorders and brain or nervous system problems. Architects of an update published in 1980, DSM-III, wanted psychiatry to become a biological science, so they emphasized medications over psychotherapy for treating mental disorders. </p>



<p>In 2010, scientists dissatisfied with DSM’s often fuzzy, symptom-based definitions of mental disorders rebelled and tried to define mental conditions based on brain and behavioral measures. One such approach involves a still-preliminary measure of a susceptibility to mental illness in general, called a p score. This score is thought to reflect a person’s “internalizing” liability to develop anxiety and mood disorders, an “externalizing” liability, such as to abuse drugs and break laws, and a propensity to delusions and other forms of psychotic thinking. Researchers hope eventually to use p scores to evaluate how well psychotherapies and psychoactive medications treat and prevent mental disorders. <em>— Bruce Bower</em></p>

<h4>Improving lives and life spans</h4>



<p>It has taken a public health crisis to stimulate a level of cooperation across disciplines within and even outside the social sciences rarely reached in the last century. After a long stretch of increasing longevity, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/blog/science-ticker/us-life-expectancy-drops-second-year">life spans of Americans have declined in recent years</a>, fueled by drug overdoses and other “deaths of despair” among poor and working-class people plagued by job losses and dim futures.</p>



<p>Economists, psychologists, psychiatrists, sociologists, epidemiologists and physicians have begun to explore potential reasons for recent longevity losses, with an eye toward stemming a rising tide of early deaths.</p>



<p>Two Princeton University economists, Anne Case and Angus Deaton, highlighted this disturbing trend in 2015. After combing through U.S. death statistics, Case and Deaton observed that <a href="https://www.pnas.org/content/112/49/15078">mortality rose sharply among middle-aged, non-Hispanic white people starting in the late 1990s</a>. In particular, white, working-class people ages 45 to 54 were increasingly drinking themselves to death with alcohol, succumbing to opioid overdoses and committing suicide.</p>



<p>Job losses that resulted as mining declined and manufacturing plants moved offshore, high health care costs, disintegrating families and other stresses rendered more people than ever susceptible to deaths of despair, the economists argued. A similar trend had stoked deaths among inner-city Black people in the 1970s and 1980s.</p>



<p>If Case and Deaton were right, then researchers urgently <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/deaths-of-despair-depression-mental-health-covid-19-pandemic">needed to find a way to measure despair</a> (<em>SN: 1/30/21, p. 16</em>). Two big ideas guided their efforts. First, don’t assume depression or other diagnoses correspond to despair. Instead, treat despair as a downhearted state of mind. Tragic life circumstances beyond one’s control, from sudden unemployment to losses of loved ones felled by COVID-19, can trigger demoralization and grief that have nothing to do with preexisting depression or any other mental disorder.</p>



<p>Second, study people throughout their lives to untangle how despair develops and prompts early deaths. It’s reasonable to wonder, for instance, if opioid addiction more often afflicts young adults who have experienced despair since childhood, versus those who first faced despair in the previous year.</p>



<p>One preliminary despair scale consists of seven indicators of this condition, including feeling hopeless and helpless, feeling unloved and worrying often. This scale has shown promise as a way to identify those who are likely to think about or attempt suicide and to abuse opioids and other drugs.</p>



<p>Deaths of despair belong to a broader public health and economic crisis, concluded a 12-member National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine committee in 2021. Since the 1990s, drug overdoses, alcohol abuse, suicides and obesity-related conditions <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/covid-19-premature-deaths-mortality-obesity-drug-overdose">caused the deaths of nearly 6.7 million U.S. adults ages 25 to 64</a>, the committee found. Whether obesity is rarely or often associated with despair is an open question.</p>

<p>Deaths from those causes hit racial minorities and working-class people of all races especially hard from the start. The COVID-19 pandemic further inflamed that mortality trend because people with underlying health conditions were especially vulnerable to the virus.</p>



<p>Perhaps findings with such alarming public health implications can inform policies that go viral, in the best sense of that word. Obesity-prevention programs for young people, expanded drug abuse treatment and stopping the flow of illegal opioids into the United States would be a start.</p>



<p>Whatever the politicians decide, the science of us has come a long way from Watson and Rayner instilling ratty fears in an unsuspecting infant. If Little Albert were alive today, he might smile, no doubt warily, at researchers working to extinguish real-life anguish.</p>

                <p><em>By</em> <a href="https://emmayoung.net/">Emma Young</a></p>



<p>Do you think a ladybird is more beautiful than a locust? If you do, you probably also feel that the ladybird is &#8220;purer&#8221; than the locust, and this leads you to believe that it possesses more inherent moral worth. This, at least, is the conclusion of a <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/01461672211023648">new paper</a> that inextricably links perceptions of purity, beauty, and moral standing for people as well as animals, and even landscapes and buildings.</p>



<span id="more-43207"></span>



<p>Earlier studies have found that the more we feel an entity has a mind, and is capable of sensations and feelings, the greater its moral standing  —  that is, we think that there is a stronger moral aspect to decisions about to how it should be treated. Aesthetic judgements have an impact, too — people and animals perceived to be more beautiful tend to be perceived as having a greater moral standing. Now the new work, published in <em>Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin</em>, on a total of more than 1,600 people, finds that perceptions of purity should be added into these equations.</p>



<p>In the first of six studies, Christoph Klebl at the University of Melbourne and colleagues used a measure of &#8220;desire to protect&#8221; a number of animals as an indicator of the moral standing ascribed to each. The participants also rated the degree to which each &#8220;ugly&#8221; or &#8220;beautiful&#8221; fish, butterfly or bird (examples of each were selected by the researchers) made them think of something &#8220;pure&#8221;, as well as how useful and inspiring they were, and how much they made them feel disgusted, afraid or sad.</p>



<p>Purity perceptions emerged as being relevant to the desire to protect. In fact, there was no <em>direct</em> effect of beauty (vs ugliness) on moral standing; instead, animals judged to be more beautiful were also judged to be more pure, and it was this that led participants to see them as having greater moral standing. (Perceptions of how “useful” the animals were also relevant).</p>



<p>A second study involved 12 photos of human faces, half previously judged to be attractive and half unattractive. It produced very similar results: perceptions of beauty were linked to purity judgements, and so to moral standing scores.</p>



<p>Next, the team turned their attention to inanimate targets. They found that, again, participants judged &#8220;beautiful&#8221; vs &#8220;ugly&#8221; lakes, mountains and even buildings to be &#8220;purer&#8221; and to be more deserving of protection, which the team again interpreted as reflecting greater moral standing. Again, though, perceived utility (and, for buildings, judgements of how inspiring each example was) did also influence the results.</p>



<p>If you’re wondering whether a desire to protect a lake, say, really reflects judgements of moral standing, the researchers did, too. Follow-up studies used a more explicit moral standing scale for the animals and buildings included in the earlier studies (rather than the &#8220;protection deservedness&#8221; scale). Participants had to rate the extent to which harming the animal or building would be morally wrong, for example. And again, beautiful animals and buildings were seen as more pure, and this lead to higher moral standing scores.</p>



<p>“The present studies provided empirical evidence that people attribute moral standing to a wide range of beautiful targets, including both sentient beings (humans and animals) and non-sentient entities (landscapes and buildings)”, the researchers note. Beyond that, “we provided empirical evidence for purity intuitions as a psychological mechanism through which people view beautiful entities as possessing moral standing.”</p>



<p>Conservation organisations are sometimes criticised for picking attractive flagship species or sites. But this work does suggest that the more beautiful the threatened target, the more strongly people will feel that those threats are morally wrong. If an &#8220;ugly&#8221; species in dire need of help shares a threatened habitat with a more attractive species, then focusing on the cute one could well be the sensible approach. The results suggest that focusing on the purity of other at-risk targets could be useful, too. Conservation efforts might perhaps highlight the purity of a building’s Modernist style, say, or the pure, original nature of an old-growth forest. “Our findings… suggest novel and practical avenues through which to leverage moral concern for a wide range of targets such as animals, plants, or works of architecture,” the team concludes.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coronavirus-covid-kids-school-return-parents-questions">6 answers to parents’ COVID-19 questions as kids return to school</a></h4>

              
                <p class="has-drop-cap" style="font-size:20px">Last fall, my husband and I managed our children’s first run-of-the-mill cold masquerading as COVID-19 with ease. We took them for the requisite tests and waited for the results. Meanwhile, the kids stayed home from school, using screens to answer math problems or watch educational programming. At least schools in Vermont, where we live, were mostly open, we said. At least the kids were getting some in-person education and social interaction. At least we were getting some uninterrupted work time.</p>



<p>Then we got our first “close contact” call from school, informing us that someone who had been near one of our kids had tested positive for COVID-19. We were told to wait seven days after exposure and then get a test or wait 10 days with no test before sending them back to school. Soon came the second call. Then a mystery case of diarrhea. The missed school days started piling up. Our ease became uneasy.</p>



<p>Elementary schools in our area remained open, initially for two days and then four, for the entire 2020–2021 school year. Even now, after a chaotic year where each kid missed weeks of in-person school, I remain thankful for the schools’ heroic efforts to maintain some semblance of normal during a very abnormal time. But as schools across the country reopen this fall, our rocky experience serves as an example of what other families could go through.</p>



<div class="wp-block-sciencenews-content-sidebar alignleft">
<h3>COVID-19: Back to school</h3>





<p>This story is one in a series looking at what to expect as U.S. children return to in-person school.</p>



<ul><li><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coronavirus-covid-kids-schools-reopening-cases">Schools are reopening. COVID-19 is still here. What does that mean for kids?</a></li><li><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/covid-school-kids-lost-education-learning-gap">What kids lost when COVID-19 upended school</a></li><li><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/covid-colds-common-respiratory-diseases-kids-return-school">Colds and other common respiratory diseases might surge as kids return to school</a></li></ul>
</div>



<p>“Large numbers of students are going to be vulnerable to frequent quarantines,” says pediatric infectious diseases specialist Adam Hersh of the University of Utah in Salt Lake City. “That is going to be incredibly disruptive.”</p>



<p>In some ways, opening schools this year is even more precarious than last fall. The <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/delta-variant-studies-cdc-coronavirus-covid-pandemic">super contagious delta variant</a> has become the dominant coronavirus strain across the United States (<em>SN: 7/30/21</em>). Some medical experts are predicting an uptick of colds and other seasonal respiratory illnesses that have symptoms mirroring those of COVID-19, which could mean even more missed school as kids wait for the all clear. And few states are requiring protective masks, even for unvaccinated students, while several states have even banned school districts from issuing mask mandates.</p>



<p>As children return to school, here are answers to some common questions parents may have. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<h4>How can children be kept safe in the classroom?</h4>



<p>Masks, masks and masks. That’s especially true for the unvaccinated under-12 set. And given low vaccination rates for teenagers across the country, masking remains the best mitigation strategy even for middle and high schoolers, Hersh says.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Masks also make other, harder-to-implement mitigation strategies less vital, say Hersh and others. For instance, last fall, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommended spacing children in school at least six feet apart as one COVID-19 precaution. But newer evidence suggests less distancing, or even no distancing, is safe, as long as everyone wears a mask.</p>



<p>“Almost every new study that comes out looking at spacing has shown the three feet of spacing to be just as protective as the six feet of distancing” when there are masks, says John Bailey. He is a domestic policy expert with the American Enterprise Institute, a think tank based in Washington, D.C., that researches education policy and other public policy–related areas.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>For instance, Dana Ramirez, a pediatrician at Children’s Hospital of the King’s Daughters in Norfolk, Va., and colleagues tracked nearly 1,200 students in grades one to 12 attending a single, private school in Virginia from August 24, 2020, to March 19, 2021. The roughly 460 students who rode buses sat two to a seat — about 2.5 feet apart — and wore masks. &nbsp;Regular COVID-19 testing — every two weeks at first and then weekly — identified 39 students who rode the buses while infected. But the researchers, whose findings appear July 20 in the <em>Journal of School Health,</em> identified <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/josh.13058">zero cases of transmission</a>.</p>



<p>Similarly in North Carolina, researchers have been tracking COVID-19 precautions and rates of transmission in the state schools since July 2020. That effort is part of the <a href="https://abcsciencecollaborative.org/">ABC Science Collaborative</a>, a multistate partnership where scientists and medical doctors collect data within schools and then inform educational leaders about best pandemic practices. It now includes 100 of North Carolina’s 150 school districts and over a million staff and students. This spring, with so many children back in school in North Carolina, some school districts reduced required distancing to less than three feet. But even at such close proximity, and with many classrooms lacking adequate ventilation, universal masking kept the <a href="https://abcsciencecollaborative.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/ABCs-Final-Report-June-2021.06-esig-DB-KZ-6-29-21.pdf">odds of a COVID-positive person transmitting the virus</a> to a close contact at less than 1 percent, the researchers note in a June 30 report to lawmakers in North Carolina.</p>



<p>As for classrooms, if “you have to cram 30 people into a really, really tiny room and much less than three feet apart, as long as everyone is masked, that’s cool,” says Kanecia Zimmerman, a pediatrician and epidemiologist at Duke University and cochair of the ABC Science Collaborative.</p>



<h4>Besides masking, what else can schools do?</h4>



<p>Deploy widespread preventive screening of all students, whether symptomatic or not, says pediatrician Lynn Silver of Berkeley, Calif. Silver is referring to rapid antigen tests, which deliver results in 15 minutes. Children as young as age 3 or 4 can administer these tests themselves, Silver says. And <a href="https://perkinelmer-appliedgenomics.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Federal-Resources-Supporting-School-Screening-Testing-Update-22-June_v2_header_2.pdf">federal funding is available</a> to interested districts.</p>



<p>Silver directs the Safely Opening Schools project, a collaboration between the Public Health Institute, headquartered in Oakland, Calif., and the California Department of Public Health. She headed a screening project from January to July across 10 school districts in five California counties. Schools generally tested students, who all wore masks, once or twice per week, and administered almost 100,000 tests.</p>



<aside class="wp-block-sciencenews-inline-related-post alignleft">
<h4>
<a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/editors-picks/2019-novel-coronavirus-outbreak">See all our coverage of the coronavirus outbreak</a>
</h4>
</aside>



<p>The team found that positive cases within schools remained extremely low, with only a <a href="https://www.phi.org/press/rapid-covid-19-testing-proves-a-key-tool-for-safer-in-person-learning-in-california-schools/">0.1 percent of over 27,000 tests in the pilot study coming back positive</a>. Subsequent PCR testing, a more accurate but slower testing method, revealed few false positives. The screenings also helped ease parents’ concerns, with some 90 percent saying that the tests helped them feel more comfortable with in-person schooling.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Screening is particularly valuable in elementary schools where all the kids are unvaccinated,” Silver says. And the tests are considerably more effective at identifying positive cases than current protocols, such as symptom and temperature checks.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Still, this sort of regular screening is labor-intensive. Caregivers must consent to their children being screened. Trained staffers are needed to administer the tests and screening takes time away from education, both Hersh and Zimmerman say. &nbsp;</p>



<p>“Screening becomes all the more important in a setting where masks are not going to be required or used at high rates,” Hersh says. But “I don’t think you could choose screening over masks and expect that you could keep the school environment safe.” &nbsp;</p>



<h4>Are disruptive, “close-contact” quarantines necessary if everyone is wearing masks?</h4>



<p>That’s ultimately a decision left up to school districts and states. But the CDC offers guidance.</p>



<p>The agency defines a “close contact” as “someone who was within six feet of an infected person … for a cumulative of 15 minutes or more over a 24-hour period.” &nbsp;And the CDC currently recommends that close contacts who are not fully vaccinated, which would include anyone under age 12 for now, should quarantine at home from seven to 14 days after exposure.</p>



<p>When a child or adult in a classroom tests positive, that can mean the entire class has to quarantine and test before returning to school. My son’s third-grade class and my daughter’s kindergarten class both shut down repeatedly for this very reason. Similarly, Zimmerman and her team found that a single positive case within a given school triggered quarantines for over 100 people.</p>



<p>But because COVID-19 transmission in schools is so low when everyone wears masks, the CDC should consider eliminating quarantine recommendations in masked environments to avoid unnecessary disruptions, Zimmerman says. “My hope is the CDC will continue to move in the way of existing science.”</p>



<p>Absent such a change, this school year could become very fragmented, especially with remote school less available than in 2020 in some places, says epidemiologist and demographer Jennifer Dowd of the University of Oxford. “It will be back like the old days when kids just missed school.” &nbsp;</p>



<h4>What if masks are optional at our child’s school?</h4>



<p>The CDC recently changed its guidance to recommend that <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/cdc-covid-coronavirus-masks-indoors-vaccinated-people-pandemic">everyone in schools should wear a mask</a>, regardless of vaccination status (<em>SN: 7/27/21</em>). The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends that everyone older than age 2 wears masks in school and care settings this fall.</p>



<p>But the decision on masking in schools is ultimately left to the states themselves, with less than a dozen mandating masks as of early August. In Florida, Texas, Arizona and a handful of other states, officials have expressly forbidden school districts from mandating masks in classrooms, even for children too young to be vaccinated.</p>



<p>That reality changes best practices entirely, Zimmerman says. Without universal masking, all the other COVID-19 precautions become essential, including six-foot distancing, those dreaded quarantines for close contacts, widespread and regular screening for teachers, staff and students and even limiting or canceling sports and <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coronavirus-covid-music-wind-instruments-spread-transmission">music</a>, activities that have shown conducive to high rates of COVID-19 spread, she says (<em>SN: 8/6/21</em>).</p>



<p>But some states are neither requiring masks nor other measures like quarantines for close contacts.&nbsp; For instance, in Texas, keeping a child who has been exposed to COVID-19 home is a choice, not a requirement. “Parents of students who are determined to be close contacts of an individual with COVID-19 <a href="https://tea.texas.gov/sites/default/files/covid/SY-20-21-Public-Health-Guidance.pdf">may opt to keep their students at home</a> during the recommended stay-at-home period,” reads an Aug. 5 statement from the Texas Education Agency.</p>



<p>These political realities can make for complicated decision making for parents and caregivers living in such states. For instance, data on rates of transmission when some children are masked and others aren’t not available. But children in such situations should still mask, Hersh says.</p>





<h4>Does the delta variant change things?</h4>



<p>Most experts concur that even with the highly transmissible delta variant of the coronavirus circulating in the country, schools should remain open. But COVID-19 mitigation measures become that much more important.</p>



<p>“Schools were relatively safe places, even during the height of the pandemic. We don’t want to tell anyone to keep their kid home out of fear. But they can be made safer by strong masking policies and by use of testing,” Silver says.</p>



<p>Evidence from school this summer in Los Angeles suggests that spread even with the delta variant remained relatively low with universal masking and regular screenings, says Daniel Benjamin, a pediatrician at Duke University and Zimmerman’s cochair at the ABC Science Collaborative.&nbsp;The <em>Los Angeles Times</em> reported August 4 that 44,000 staffers and K–12 students attended classes from late June to late July. At&nbsp;the beginning of summer school, 1 in 1,000 tests came back positive for the coronavirus compared with 6 in 1,000 at the end of the program. Most people who contracted COVID-19 did so <a href="https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2021-08-04/coronavirus-infections-increased-in-lausd-summer-school-but-affected-a-tiny-percentage">outside of school</a>, the paper reports. This case study suggests that delta isn’t better at evading masks than other variants, Benjamin says.</p>



<p>Dowd concurs. “Delta does seem way more transmissible but … it can’t defy the laws of physics.”</p>



<h4>What should we do when our kid gets a cold?</h4>



<p>Medical experts worry that the pandemic’s protracted period of social distancing could make children more susceptible to colds and other common respiratory infections this fall and winter. Worse, there’s no surefire way to distinguish between cold and COVID-19 symptoms.</p>



<p>For that reason, “it’s never a bad idea for a symptomatic individual to get tested,” Hersh says. &nbsp;</p>



<p>But for unvaccinated children, all those sniffles could add up to a lot of missed school as kids wait for a negative COVID-19 test result. Last school year, it typically took two to four days to receive my kids’ PCR test results.&nbsp;</p>



<p>To avoid contributing to the spread of these other respiratory diseases, “I hope parents are a little more sensitive about keeping kids home if they’re sick,” Dowd says. But, she adds, “for so many reasons, that’s not always practical. Kids can have sniffles for months on end.”</p>



<p>One bright spot this year, potentially, is the widespread availability of rapid antigen tests. While these tests can deliver false negatives in asymptomatic individuals, they are <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/69/wr/mm695152a3.htm">almost 100 percent accurate</a> at identifying COVID-19 in symptomatic individuals, according to a Jan. 1 study in <em>Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report</em>. For that reason, Dowd and others recommend that parents keep some of those tests at home. But they can get pricey. My local pharmacy sells two-packs for around $20 to $25. Schools, though, can utilize federal funding to stock those tests and use them when a kid shows up with a stuffy nose.</p>



<p>I used the experts’ advice immediately. In mid-July, my son woke up with a scratchy throat and we went to the clinic for a PCR test. His thankfully negative result took 48 hours to come in, resulting in two days of missed camp and the all too familiar work-parenting juggle. By the time my daughter got sick a few days later, though, I had purchased the rapid antigen tests. Fifteen minutes later, I had her negative results in hand. Camp was a go.&nbsp;</p>

              <h4><a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2021/08/10/people-who-trust-science-are-less-likely-to-fall-for-misinformation-unless-it-sounds-sciencey/">People Who Trust Science Are Less Likely To Fall For Misinformation — Unless It Sounds Sciencey</a></h4>

              
                <p><em>By</em> <a href="https://twitter.com/mattbwarren">Matthew Warren</a></p>



<p>“Trust in the science” is the kind of refrain commonly uttered by well-meaning individuals looking to promote positive, scientifically-backed change, such as encouraging action against climate change or improving uptake of vaccines. The hope is that if people are encouraged to trust science, they will not be duped by those who are promoting the opposite agenda — one which often flies in the face of scientific evidence. But are people actually less likely to fall for misinformation when they have trust in science?</p>



<p>Yes and no, <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0022103121000871?dgcid=rss_sd_all">according to a new a study</a> in the <em>Journal of Experimental Social Psychology</em>. Thomas C O’Brien and colleagues from the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign find that people with greater trust in science are generally less likely to believe misinformation. But when that misinformation is presented with scientific-sounding content to back it up, they become more easily duped by it.</p>



<span id="more-43196"></span>



<p>In the first study, 532 online participants read an article about the “Valza virus”, which stated that the virus had been created as a bioweapon in a government lab and subsequently covered up. The article was written informally, in a style meant to imitate real online posts made by conspiracy theorists. In one condition, the article cited scientists who said that studies in their own lab proved that there had been a conspiracy; in the other, the article instead quoted activists.</p>



<p>Participants then answered questions about how much they believed the article (e.g. to what extent they agreed it was “credible” or “probably true”) and whether they felt it should be shared with a class studying current affairs. (They also answered other questions about their comprehension of the text, in order to obscure the purpose of the study). Finally, participants rated their own trust in science, responding to statements like “scientific theories are trustworthy”, and answered questions that probed their own understanding of scientific methodology.</p>



<p>The team found that, overall, people with a greater trust in science and/or a stronger understanding of methodology were less likely to believe the conspiracy theory. But the article’s content made a difference: people who had a high trust in science were more likely to believe the article if it had quoted scientists than if it had not. Similarly, this group was more likely to say that the article should be shared with the current affairs class if it had apparently scientific content. For people with lower levels of trust in science, whether or not the article had cited scientists made no difference to their beliefs or intentions to share it.</p>



<p>A subsequent study looked at people&#8217;s belief in a conspiracy theory about genetically modified foods, and this time used real articles and pictures from websites. All participants read that genetically modified foods caused tumours, and that this was being covered up. In one condition, they saw articles that referred to an actual scientific paper which supported the theory (and which, unknown to participants, has since been heavily criticised and retracted). In the other condition, they again read arguments by activists, without any scientific content.</p>



<p>The results were the same: although, overall, people who trusted in science were less likely to believe this conspiracy theory, their levels of belief increased when the article contained supposedly scientific content.</p>



<p>In a final study, the team found that people were less likely to believe the conspiracy about genetically modified foods when they had first been asked to think about times when it is important to critically evaluate evidence, compared to when they had been asked to think of times when science had benefited humanity.</p>



<p>The research suggests that trust in science can actually <em>increase</em> people’s vulnerability to pseudoscience, the authors write. Broad campaigns to promote trust in science may therefore not be that useful; instead, it may be more beneficial to promote critical analysis skills.</p>



<p>That said, there is clearly some benefit to trusting science: people with low trust in science tended to believe the conspiracy theories regardless of their content, while those with high trust only showed a tendency to believe them if they contained some (pseudo)scientific content. So it seems likely that those broad campaigns could still have some positive effects. Still, to help people spot misinformation it seems important to teach them to critically evaluate evidence and understand that science isn&#8217;t infallible.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/wind-farm-windbreak-turbine-speed-power-output">Windbreaks, surprisingly, could help wind farms boost power output</a></h4>

              
                <p>Windbreaks may sound like a counterintuitive idea for boosting the performance of a wind turbine. But physicists report that low walls that block wind could actually help wind farms produce more power.</p>



<p>Scientists already knew that the output of a single wind turbine could be improved with a windbreak. While windbreaks slow wind speed close to the ground, above the height of the windbreak, wind speeds actually increase as air rushes over the top. But for large wind farms, there’s a drawback. A windbreak’s wake slows the flow of air as it travels farther through the rows of turbines. That could suggest that windbreaks would be a wash for wind farms with many turbines.</p>



<p>But by striking a balance between these competing effects, windbreaks placed in front of each turbine can increase power output, new computer simulations suggest. It comes down to the windbreaks’ dimensions. Squat, wide barriers are the way to go, according to a simulated wind farm with six rows of turbines. To optimize performance, windbreaks should be a tenth the height of the turbine and at least five times the width of the blades, physicists report July 30 in <em>Physical Review Fluids</em>. Such an arrangement could <a href="https://journals.aps.org/prfluids/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevFluids.6.074611">increase the total power by about 10 percent</a>, the researchers found. That’s the equivalent of adding an additional turbine, on average, for every 10 in a wind farm.</p>



<p>In the simulations, the wind always came from the same direction, suggesting the technique might be useful in locations where wind tends to blow one way, such as coastal regions. Future studies could investigate how this technique might apply in places where wind direction varies.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/covid-school-kids-lost-education-learning-gap">What kids lost when COVID-19 upended school</a></h4>

              
                <p class="has-drop-cap" style="font-size:20px">At the start of a school year, kids usually show up with oversized backpacks stocked with fresh pencils, crisp notebooks and snacks. This back-to-school season, many children will carry extra baggage.</p>



<p>Eighteen months of an unprecedented pandemic turned routines — including going to school — topsy-turvy. This fall, many kids are heading to their new classrooms toting traumas, worries and gaps in their learning.</p>



<p>What’s more, schoolchildren are returning as the pandemic is once again shifting the ground under our feet. Infections driven by the more contagious delta variant of the coronavirus are putting new twists on questions over how to keep kids learning while still protecting unvaccinated children from illness. These burdens may profoundly change yet another school year.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<div class="wp-block-sciencenews-content-sidebar alignleft">
<h3>COVID-19: Back to school</h3>





<p>This story is one in a series looking at what to expect as U.S. children return to in-person school.</p>



<ul><li><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coronavirus-covid-kids-schools-reopening-cases">Schools are reopening. COVID-19 is still here. What does that mean for kids?</a></li><li><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coronavirus-covid-kids-school-return-parents-questions">6 answers to parents’ COVID-19 questions as kids return to school</a></li><li><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/covid-colds-common-respiratory-diseases-kids-return-school">Colds and other common respiratory diseases might surge as kids return to school</a></li></ul>
</div>



<p>This year comes on the heels of one already marked by losses big and small. When school buildings abruptly closed in the spring of 2020 and school shifted online, many children lost regular time spent together with friends and teachers. Kids missed out on gym class, organized sports and time to goof around at recess. Some kids even lost their voices, digitally silenced by exasperated teachers doing their best to corral rambunctious students in virtual classrooms. “I’m muting you,” these kids were told.</p>



<p>But every student had their own personal pandemic experience. “You can’t generalize,” says Pedro Noguera, dean of the education school at the University of Southern California in Los Angeles. Half of the kids in the United States went to in-person school by the end of 2020, either full-time or on a hybrid schedule. Faced with closed schools, some kids instead had private teachers and learning bubbles. Others muddled along on their own, without solid internet access or a quiet place to sit.</p>



<p>Too many kids who rely on schools as a safety net went without consistent meals and regular check-ins from adults. More than 1.5 million kids globally <a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(21)01253-8/fulltext">lost a parent, live-in grandparent or other live-in relative</a> to the pandemic, scientists estimated July 20 in the <em>Lancet</em>. School counselors had harder times reaching kids.</p>



<p>These pandemic losses were not spread evenly. Existing inequities <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coronavirus-covid-19-creative-school-plans-students-inequities">deepened</a> during the pandemic (<em>SN: 9/8/20</em>). Children from Black and Hispanic communities, and other traditionally underserved groups of kids, suffered some of the biggest losses.</p>

<p>Despite the variation, a patchwork of new data is beginning to put numbers to the scope of the problems that teachers, school administrators and families will face as students return to school. Understanding these challenges is a step toward helping kids come back to the classroom and, ultimately, thrive, says Kathleen Ethier, a social and behavioral scientist at the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. “Maybe one of the positive take-home messages from this past year and a half,” she says, “is that we understand now just how important school is.”</p>



<h3>Learning loss</h3>



<p>Getting a measure of academic performance that applies to all kids across the United States is tough. But early in the pandemic, students’ test scores hinted at the academic blows that were to come.</p>



<p>Comparing previous test score changes of kids in California to the changes from fall of 2019 to the winter of 2020 showed an <a href="https://edpolicyinca.org/publications/covid-19-impacts-student-learning">overall academic lag</a>. “On average, kids are two to two-and-a-half months behind where we would expect they would have been if COVID hadn’t happened,” says learning science expert Libby Pier of Education Analytics, a nonprofit based in Madison, Wis. Considering that a normal school year is nine months long, “that’s a quarter to a third of the school year they missed out on.”</p>



<p>The pandemic, of course, didn’t end in 2020; measures of academic slipping got worse as time went on. Elementary school students across the United States finished the 2020–2021 school year an average of five months behind in math and four months behind in reading, an <a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/public-and-social-sector/our-insights/covid-19-and-education-the-lingering-effects-of-unfinished-learning">analysis</a> from the analytics firm McKinsey &amp; Company, headquartered in New York City, shows. Those numbers, described in a July 27 report, don’t reflect all students. The analysis counted results only from kids who were in schools to take the tests; kids at home might have fared worse.</p>

</div>



<p>The learning lag was most <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coronavirus-covid-19-creative-school-plans-students-inequities">pronounced in children from underserved communities</a>: those who are Hispanic, Black, economically disadvantaged or learning English (<em>SN</em>: 9/8/20). Students in majority-Black schools ended the year six months behind where they would have been in both reading and math; students in white-majority schools lost four months of math and three months of reading.</p>



<p>It’s impossible to say to what extent school closures and shifts to virtual learning played in these lower-than-expected test scores. “Right now, we don’t have the evidence to conclude whether the impacts we are seeing are because students were learning remotely, or because there was a global pandemic happening,” Pier says. Kids could have also been struggling with losing a parent, caring for siblings or internet connection problems. Without all the information about kids’ lives, including their school experiences, she says, “we can’t answer the questions we want.”</p>



<h3>Virtual, for some</h3>



<p>One big question is how virtual school stacks up against in-person school. In the fall of 2020, the CDC’s Ethier and her colleagues asked 1,290 parents of 5- to 12-year-olds about the type of schooling available to their child, along with questions about the well-being of the family.</p>



<p>On 11 of 17 measures, families with kids who were doing partial or full-time virtual school <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/70/wr/mm7011a1.htm">were doing worse</a> than those who attended full-time in person. Kids in virtual school were getting less exercise, less time in person with friends and less time outside. Parents of kids in virtual school were worse off, too, reporting mental distress, difficulty sleeping and conflicts between work and childcare. “Both in terms of stress that families feel, and outcomes among children, there really were significant differences” between in-person and virtual learning, Ethier says.</p>



<p>Ethier’s study, published March 19 in <em>Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report</em>, “gives us some clues about who to watch out for and what to watch out for,” she says.</p>



<p>Families of color were more likely to have a student in virtual school than white families, Ethier’s team found. A recent study of New York schools revealed similar trends. Across the state, about <a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2781960">18 percent of elementary students had access to in-person school</a>. But a racial breakdown turned up stark differences in who could go to school and who had to stay home. About 30 percent of white students could attend in-person school; for Black students, that number was only 5 percent, Ashley Fox and her colleagues report July 15 in <em>JAMA Network Open</em>.</p>

<p>More advantaged students, such as white, suburban middle-class kids, had considerably more access to in-person school than other groups. Those other groups included students from urban areas, low-income families, students with disabilities and students experiencing homelessness, Fox, a health policy researcher at University at Albany in New York, and her team found. &nbsp;</p>



<p>Even before the pandemic, schools had massive inequities; depending on where students live, they received different educational experiences. Fox’s new tally of which schools stayed open shows that the pandemic exacerbated these inequities. A caveat, Fox says, is that the researchers measured access to in-person school, not whether a family actually chose that option.</p>



<h3>An emotional toll</h3>



<p>These academic inequities are not surprising, says Noguera. “The real issue now is what we do about it.” It would be a mistake, he says, “to focus narrowly on academics and ignore some of the mental health challenges that kids will be bringing back with them.”</p>



<p>Depression and anxiety rates among children and adolescents are rising. More kids with <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/69/wr/mm6945a3.htm#F1_down">mental health crises</a> are turning up in emergency departments, scientists described in <em>Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report</em> November 13. Compared with April through December of 2019, the proportion of children ages 5 to 11 who had mental health-related visits in the same months of 2020 increased by about 25 percent on average, from 782 mental-health-related visits per 100,000 total visits in 2019 to 972 such visits in 2020. &nbsp;For adolescents ages 12 to 17, that proportion increased by about 30 percent, from 3,098 mental-health visits per 100,000 total visits in 2019 to 4,051 in 2020.</p>

<p>And in February and March of this year, there were an average of 855 emergency department visits a week for suspected suicide attempts among 12- to 17-year-old girls, an <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/70/wr/mm7024e1.htm?s_cid=mm7024e1_x">increase of about 50 percent</a> over with the same winter weeks of 2019, scientists reported June 18 in <em>Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report</em>.</p>



<p>These studies weren’t designed to pinpoint causes of this increasing emotional distress. But hints come from surveys of families, such as Ethier’s. Parents of children who received virtual school were more likely to report their kids had worse mental or emotional health compared with parents of children who attended in-person school.</p>



<p>Interrupted schooling may cast long shadows, says Dimitri Christakis of Seattle Children’s Research Institute. Earlier studies have linked educational attainment with people’s future health, earnings potential and even how long they live. Losing out on school is a big deal, says Christakis. “Children’s lives, their longevity, their health, will be impacted,” he says, “not in the short term, necessarily, but over their life-span.”</p>



<p>As students come back into their classrooms, teachers, administrators and parents would do well to acknowledge all the burdens kids are carrying into class, and not just the academic ones. “We should be thinking of the restart, the return to school, as an opportunity to do things differently,” Noguera says. “To not just to go back to the way it was, but to really try to make schools much more responsive to the needs of kids and parents than they have been.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/climate-change-un-ipcc-report-humans">The new UN climate change report shows there’s no time for denial or delay</a></h4>

              
                <p>The science is unequivocal: Humans are dramatically overhauling Earth’s climate. The <a href="https://www.ipcc.ch/assessment-report/ar6/">effects of climate change are now found everywhere</a> around the globe and are intensifying rapidly, states a sweeping new analysis released August 9 by the United Nations’ Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, or IPCC. And the window to reverse some of these effects is closing.</p>



<p>“There is no room for doubt any longer” about humans’ responsibility for current climate change, says Kim Cobb, a climate scientist at Georgia Tech in Atlanta and an author on the first chapter of the report. “And now we can say quite definitely that a whole class of extreme [events]” is linked to human-caused climate change.</p>



<p>Climate change is already affecting every region on Earth in multiple ways, from <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/human-driven-climate-change-pacific-northwest-heat-wave-temperatures">drought and fire conditions in the U.S. West</a> to heat waves in Europe and flooding in Asia, the report notes&nbsp; (<em>SN: 7/7/21</em>). Each of the past four decades <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/climate-weather-normals-30-years-hottest-record-united-states">has been the warmest on record</a> since preindustrial times (<em>SN: 5/26/21</em>).</p>



<p>The study also looks at several different scenarios of greenhouse gas warming, including perhaps the most hopeful scenarios in which by 2050 the world achieves “net zero” carbon emissions, where emitted gases are balanced by carbon removal from the atmosphere.</p>





<p>If the world gets down to net-zero emissions, the decades afterward hold “hints of light,” says Baylor Fox-Kemper, an oceanographer at Brown University in Providence, R.I., and the coordinating lead author of the new report’s chapter on oceans and Earth’s icy regions. “Temperatures come back down a little — not all the way back to preindustrial times, but there’s a little recovery.”</p>



<p>But other changes are irreversible on near-future timescales — that is, the next century or more, Fox-Kemper says. Even in those mid-century net-zero emissions scenarios, “it’s still pretty bad,” he says. Sea levels, for example, will continue to rise until about the year 2300, driven in part by the <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/greenland-ice-sheet-melt-sea-level-rise-climate-change">juggernaut of Greenland’s melting ice sheet</a> (<em>SN: 9/30/20</em>). “We may have already crossed [the] threshold beyond which Greenland’s melting could be stopped,” he says. Still, swift and deep emissions reductions would significantly slow how much sea levels will rise by the end of the century, the report finds.</p>

<h4>Feeling the heat</h4>



<p>With more global warming, effects on weather patterns and extremes become more pronounced. A new report by the United Nation’s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change estimates how much worse the effects could get as warming hits 1.5 degrees Celsius, 2 degrees C or 4 degrees C over preindustrial levels. For instance, severe droughts are about twice as frequent today as in the past, and could be five times more frequent with 4 degrees C of warming.</p>

<p>The new analysis is the sixth in a series of massive assessment reports undertaken by the IPCC since 1990. In each report, hundreds of scientists from around the world analyze the findings of thousands of studies to form a consensus picture of how Earth’s climate is changing and what role people play in those changes.</p>



<p>“The key message [of this report] is still the same as was first published in 1990 … human-induced emissions of greenhouse gases pose a threat for humans’ well-being and the biosphere,” said Petteri Taalas, Secretary-General of the World Meteorological Organization, at an event announcing the report’s release August 9.</p>



<p>But researchers understand climate change far better now than they did in 1990, when the first assessment report was released. In the last three decades, new findings have poured in from tens of thousands more observing stations, from a wealth of satellite instruments, and <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/why-climate-change-models-disagree-earth-worst-case-scenarios">from dramatically improved climate simulations</a> (<em>SN: 1/7/20</em>).</p>



<p>The IPCC’s fifth assessment report, released in several parts during 2013 and 2014, was itself a game changer. It was the first to state that greenhouse gas emissions from human activities <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/ipcc-calls-swift-switch-alternative-power">are driving climate change</a> — a conclusion that set the stage for 195 nations <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/195-nations-approve-historic-climate-accord">to agree in Paris in 2015 to curb those emissions</a> (<em>SN: 4/13/14</em>; <em>SN: 12/12/15</em>).</p>



<p>The Paris Agreement set a target of limiting the global average temperature to 2 degrees Celsius above preindustrial times. But many island nations and others most threatened by climate change feared that this target wasn’t stringent enough. So in an unprecedented step, the U.N. commissioned a report by the IPCC to compare how a future Earth might look if warming were limited to just 1.5 degrees Celsius instead.</p>

<p>That special report, released in 2018, revealed in fine detail <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/climate-change-target-top-science-stories-2018-yir">how just half a degree of extra warming by 2100 could matter</a>, from the increased likelihood of heat waves to higher sea levels (<em>SN: 12/17/18</em>). The one-two punch of those concrete findings and scorching temperatures in 2019 grabbed the attention of public and policy makers alike.</p>



<p>Scientists were surprised by how hard the 1.5 degree report landed. “Even for me,” says Ko Barrett, vice chair of the IPCC and a senior advisor for climate at the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, “a person who has dedicated my entire professional career to addressing climate change, the report caused me to rethink my personal contribution to the climate problem. Climate change was not some distant temperature target to be hit in the ethereal future. It was close; it was now.”</p>



<p>IPCC scientists hope the new report, with its powerful emphasis on the regional and local effects of climate change — fully a third of the report is devoted to outlining those — will have a similar impact. And its timing is significant. Beginning October 31, heads of state from around the world are scheduled to meet in Glasgow, Scotland, to discuss updated — and hopefully increasingly ambitious — plans to reduce emissions to meet the targets of the 2015 Paris Agreement.&nbsp;</p>



<p>With previous reports, “the world listened, but it didn’t hear. Or the world listened, but it didn’t act strongly enough,” said Inger Andersen, executive director of the U.N. Environment Programme, at the Aug. 9 event for the report’s release. “We certainly urge them … to listen to the facts on the table now.”</p>

<p>The biomedical research enterprise experienced a year of reckoning in 2020. Global cooperation to create a COVID-19 vaccine at an unprecedented pace shows the promise of research. Yet the pandemic, the resulting economic and social uncertainties, and the urgency of addressing systemic racial and regional inequities all add to longstanding concerns about the sustainability of the biomedical research enterprise.</p>



<p>Most of us in the biomedical research community agree &mdash; we need a new vision for a healthier future.</p>



<p>To help reimagine that future, the Health Research Alliance (HRA) and the Public Library of Science (PLOS) partnered to <a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2020/12/reimagine-biomedical-research-for-a-healthier-future/">launch</a> the Reimagine Biomedical Research for a Healthier Future Essay Challenge. We invited the community to submit ideas that re-commit to serving society and achieving an equitable, diverse, and creative environment for all those working to advance scientific discovery and improve human well-being.</p>



<p>Now, we are thrilled to announce the winners and honorable mentions of the challenge, who will all present their ideas at the <strong>Reimagine Biomedical Research for a Healthier Future Symposium</strong> to be hosted by HRA on <strong>September 23, 2021</strong>, from <strong>12&ndash;1pm Eastern Daylight Time</strong> (UTC&minus;04:00).</p>



<p>Congratulations to the two winning essays, published as perspectives in<a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.3001349" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> <em>PLOS Biology</em></a> and<a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosmedicine/article?id=10.1371/journal.pmed.1003726" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> <em>PLOS Medicine</em></a>:</p>

<p>We received close to 100 essays proposing a wide variety of ideas. The <a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2020/12/reimagine-biomedical-research-for-a-healthier-future/">judging panel</a> had a difficult time selecting essays, but eventually put forth those that were the most feasible, had high potential for impact, and would spark valuable discussion among the community.</p>



<p>We thank everyone who participated in the challenge. We also note that neither PLOS nor HRA necessarily advocate for the specific ideas outlined in the winning essays. However, we do agree that these seven pieces will foster a dialogue that could spur meaningful change within the biomedical research ecosystem. Ultimately, these changes should advance scientific discovery and ensure those advances have equitable impact.</p>



<p>To spark conversation and action, we encourage you to read the perspectives and the blogs, and to attend the symposium on September 23, 2021 prepared to ask questions of the authors.</p>



<p>Our goal is for the discussion during the symposium to stimulate action and change. Ideally, this effort will ultimately result in a more equitable and effective biomedical research ecosystem.</p>

                <p><em>By&nbsp;</em><a href="http://emilyoliviareynolds.com/">Emily Reynolds</a></p>



<p>“Service with a smile” —&nbsp;having a friendly, cheerful demeanor when working with customers in retail or hospitality — has long been identified as having a negative impact on worker wellbeing. One <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0963721418812771?journalCode=cdpa">2019 study</a>, for example, found that “faking it” was of significant detriment to service workers, whilst the term “emotional labour” was <a href="https://www.ucpress.edu/book/9780520272941/the-managed-heart">first used</a> by sociologists to describe jobs which require workers to display positive emotions.</p>



<p>And when this requirement to provide service with a smile is combined with a reliance on tips for income, there can be horrible consequences, a <a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2021-54880-001">new study </a>suggests. A team led by the University of Notre Dame’s Timothy G. Kundro finds that the combination of financial dependence and deference to customers that tipping and emotional labour involves can lead to customers feeling like they have more power and ultimately sexually harassing workers.</p>



<span id="more-43181"></span>



<p>For the first study, the team recruited 92 employees working at least 35 hours per week and receiving regular tips from customers. First, participants indicated how financially dependent they were on customer tips by reporting what percentage of their total income came from them, and also answered questions about how much they had to appear friendly, sensitive, and composed.</p>



<p>The psychological power of customers versus workers was also measured, with participants indicating whether they felt customers had more power than them and whether or not they had to behave in a way that pleased those they were serving. Finally, they rated how many times they had been sexually harassed by customers over the last six months.</p>



<p>Workers who were both highly dependent on customer tips for income <em>and</em> who indicated that they were required to behave in a pleasing way reported that customers had high levels of power over them — more than workers who weren’t dependent on tips or who didn’t have to provide “service with a smile”. And in turn, this group also reported a higher incidence of sexual harassment at work. This suggests that the combination of both relying on tips and service with a smile can be the catalyst for customers sexually harassing workers.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>&nbsp;A second study looked at the behaviour of customers. Participants, 171 men attracted to women, were asked to imagine they were a customer arriving at a local restaurant: all saw an image of a waitress who was to serve them, displaying either a pleasant, submissive facial expression or a non-deferent one, before reading a transcript of an exchange and finally an image of their receipt.</p>



<p>In the high financial dependence condition, the final receipt included a line for a tip, with a reminder that tips are appreciated; the receipt in the low financial dependence condition stated that employees were paid a fair wage and tips were not necessary. Participants then indicated how much power they believed they had in the situation.</p>



<p>Finally, participants stated how attractive they found the waitress and how likely they would be to ask her for a drink, ask her for her phone number, or touch her in a “joking” manner. They also indicated how much they agreed with statements related to power including “If I asked for her phone number she’d probably give it to me” and “If I asked her for a date, she’d probably say yes”.</p>



<p>Again, participants’ sense of power and intentions to sexually harass the waitress depended on a combination of how financially dependent she was on tips and her displays of emotional labour. Specifically, when they had seen pictures of a submissive, smiling woman <em>and</em> been encouraged to tip, they felt they had more power over her. This in turn led to a higher likelihood that participants would attempt to show inappropriate sexual behaviour towards the waitress.</p>



<p>Thus, across both studies, the team found that two crucial elements of service work — emotional labour and financial dependence through receiving tips — were closely linked to the likelihood of customers sexually harassing them. This can put serving staff in a double bind: not engaging in emotional labour and reducing likelihood of receiving tips then <em>increases</em> financial dependence on customers, thus putting them more at risk. Psychological interventions may not be the answer here. Rather, practical solutions could help: reducing the need for emotional labour in employees, for one, or ensuring that all workers are paid a decent living wage and are less reliant on tips.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/colliding-photons-matter-particle-physics">Colliding photons were spotted making matter. But are the photons ‘real’?</a></h4>

              
                <p>Collide light with light, and poof, you get matter and antimatter. It sounds like a simple idea, but it turns out to be surprisingly hard to prove.</p>



<p>A team of physicists is now claiming the first direct observation of the long-sought Breit-Wheeler process, in which two particles of light, or photons, crash into one another and produce an electron and its antimatter counterpart, a positron. But like a discussion from an introductory philosophy course, the detection’s significance hinges on the definition of the word “real.” Some physicists argue the photons don&#8217;t qualify as real, raising questions about the observation&#8217;s implications.</p>



<p>Predicted more than 80 years ago, the Breit-Wheeler process had never been directly observed, although scientists have seen related processes, such as <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/lhc-atlas-photons-interact-physics">light scattering off of light</a> (<em>SN: 8/14/17</em>). New measurements from the STAR experiment at Brookhaven National Laboratory’s Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider <a href="https://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.127.052302">match predictions</a> for the elusive transformation, Brookhaven physicist Daniel Brandenburg and colleagues report in the July 30 <em>Physical Review Letters</em>.</p>



<p>“The idea that you can create matter from light smashing together is an interesting concept,” says Brandenburg. It’s a striking demonstration of the physics immortalized in Einstein’s equation E=mc<sup>2</sup>, which revealed that energy and mass are two sides of the same coin.</p>





<p>Whether the observation truly qualifies depends on whether the photons are considered “real,” as demanded by the Breit-Wheeler process, or “virtual.” In particle physics, virtual particles are ones that appear only for brief instants and don’t carry their normal masses. &nbsp;</p>



<p>Photons from a commonplace source of light, like a lightbulb or a laser, are real, physicists agree. But the bona fides of Brandenburg and colleagues’ photons are up for debate. That’s because the light the team is colliding comes from an unusual source.</p>



<p>In the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider, atomic nuclei travel at nearly the speed of light before ramming into one another. Those speedy nuclei are surrounded by electromagnetic fields, and those fields have photons associated with them. Normally, such photons from electromagnetic fields are virtual. But in the experiment, the photons act as if they are real due to the high speeds at which the two nuclei are zipping along.</p>



<p>The new evidence for the Breit-Wheeler process comes from collisions where the nuclei just missed one another. In those cases, the electromagnetic fields of the two nuclei overlap, and two photons from those fields can collide. So the researchers looked for near-misses that spit out one electron and one positron.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" width="680" height="550" src="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/080521_EC_light-matter_inline.jpg" alt="illustration of two photons colliding, producing an electron and a positron" class="wp-image-3102271" srcset="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/080521_EC_light-matter_inline.jpg 680w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/080521_EC_light-matter_inline-474x383.jpg 474w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/080521_EC_light-matter_inline-556x450.jpg 556w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/080521_EC_light-matter_inline-230x186.jpg 230w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><figcaption><span class="caption wp-caption-3102271">When two atomic nuclei (red) pass close by, two particles of light (yellow) collide, producing a negatively charged electron ( e<sup>&#8211;</sup>) and a positively charged positron (e<sup>+</sup>).</span><span class="credit wp-credit-3102271">BNL</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>But, says study coauthor Zhangbu Xu, a physicist also at Brookhaven in Upton, N.Y., “the issue is how you actually say these are from [real] photons, not from other processes.” To shore up the case that the particles came from real photons, the researchers studied the angles between those particles, which differ depending on whether real or virtual photons collided. The angles matched expectations for real photons, suggesting that the team had seen the legit Breit-Wheeler process.</p>



<p>Still, “strictly speaking,” says particle physicist Lucian Harland-Lang of the University of Oxford, the experiment is “kind of one step removed” from the true Breit-Wheeler process. Although the photons behave almost as if real, they are technically virtual.</p>



<p>Brandenburg and colleagues take a different view, akin to a physics version of the classic duck test: If it walks like a duck and quacks like a duck, then it probably is a duck. If the reality of a photon is based only on how it behaves then these would be real photons.</p>



<p>And the scientists’ measurements back that up, says laser plasma physicist Stuart Mangles of Imperial College London, who was not involved with the new study: “Everything they’re measuring about it makes it look like a real photon.” However, Mangles notes that the photons are still virtual by some definitions: Unlike normal photons, which have no mass, these photons do have mass.</p>



<p>One way to skirt thorny questions about the definition of reality would be to perform this experiment with indisputably real photons. Mangles and others are working toward detecting the Breit-Wheeler process with lasers, which produce light that’s as real as the light allowing you to read this article. That, physicists are hoping, will clinch the case for colliding light making matter.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coronavirus-covid-kids-schools-reopening-cases">Schools are reopening. COVID-19 is still here. What does that mean for kids?</a></h4>

              
                <p class="has-drop-cap" style="font-size:20px">As the delta variant of the coronavirus sends case counts surging, millions of U.S. children are heading back to school in person, many for the first time in more than a year. It’s a confluence of events that has some parents, educators and health officials worried.</p>



<p>The vast majority of children are unvaccinated, making them one of the populations most vulnerable to the virus. Crowd them together, mix in a more transmissible variant, and it could create a perfect recipe for infection and spreading COVID-19 if extra precautions like wearing masks aren’t taken.</p>



<p>Vaccines offer the best protection, but many children can’t yet get COVID-19 shots. While vaccines for children younger than 12 are in testing, it <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/pfizer-covid-vaccine-kids-12-to-15-years-old-fda">could still be months</a> before they’re available for most children in elementary and middle school (<em>SN: 5/10/21</em>). Their younger siblings will probably have to wait longer.</p>



<div class="wp-block-sciencenews-content-sidebar alignleft">
<h3>COVID-19: Back to school</h3>





<p>This story is one in a series looking at what to expect as U.S. children return to in-person school.</p>



<ul><li><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/covid-school-kids-lost-education-learning-gap">What kids lost when COVID-19 upended school</a></li><li><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coronavirus-covid-kids-school-return-parents-questions">6 answers to parents’ COVID-19 questions as kids return to school</a></li><li><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/covid-colds-common-respiratory-diseases-kids-return-school">Colds and other common respiratory diseases might surge as kids return to school</a></li></ul>
</div>



<p>Even once vaccines are in hand for the youngest, it’s unclear how many will get the shots. Most eligible 12-year-olds and teens have yet to get vaccinated. Some people have even questioned whether children need to be vaccinated now, given that their risk of becoming severely ill from COVID-19 is less than that of adults.</p>



<p>That is true: Most children who get COVID-19 recover with no lingering effects. But a year and a half into the pandemic, there’s still much that researchers and doctors don’t know about the consequences of the disease for kids. Among the unknowns: How often do kids develop lingering symptoms, or long COVID-19? Why do some healthy children develop serious, run-amok inflammation weeks after recovering from COVID-19? For some kids, that complication comes even more out of the blue: They weren’t even aware they were infected.</p>



<p>Now the delta variant is causing yet more uncertainty. Studies primarily involving adults show that it’s <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/delta-variant-studies-cdc-coronavirus-covid-pandemic">making people sicker</a> than earlier versions of the coronavirus (<em>SN: 7/30/21</em>). Will it hit kids harder too?</p>



<p>Researchers are beginning to gather the data needed to answer those questions, though there is a dearth of data so far on kids and delta. The emerging picture suggests that while the virus remains no big deal for many children, it is a serious problem for others.</p>



<h4>A top 10 killer</h4>



<p>“It drives me crazy to hear over and over again that the virus is not serious for children,” said Andrew Pavia, a pediatric infectious diseases doctor at the University of Utah in Salt Lake City. While COVID-19 doesn’t tend to strike kids as hard as it does adults, “By every measure, its <a href="https://www.idsociety.org/multimedia/videos/idsa-media-briefing-covid-vaccines--the-delta-variant/">impact is greater than the impact of influenza</a>,” he said July 13 during a news conference sponsored by the Infectious Diseases Society of America.</p>

<p>Since the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention began tracking flu deaths in 2004, <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/flu/season/faq-flu-season-2020-2021.htm">childhood deaths from flu</a> in the United States have ranged from a low of 37 in the 2011–2012 flu season to a high of 199 in the 2019–2020 season. <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/covid-19-coronavirus-precautions-flu-respiratory-infections-cases">Flu nearly disappeared</a> in the 2020–2021 season as precautions against the coronavirus helped limit the spread of some other respiratory illnesses, too — except some colds, for still-mysterious reasons (<em>SN: 2/2/21</em>). That flu season set a new low with one pediatric death reported. The coronavirus, however, proved deadly to more than twice the number of children as flu claimed over the last 18 months. As of August 4, COVID-19 has <a href="https://data.cdc.gov/NCHS/Provisional-COVID-19-Deaths-Focus-on-Ages-0-18-Yea/nr4s-juj3">killed 416 U.S. children</a> of the nearly 4.3 million infected since January 2020.</p>



<p>“Anything that kills more than 350 children a year is going to automatically rank in the top 10 causes” of childhood death, says Debbie-Ann Shirley, a pediatric infectious diseases specialist at University of Virginia Health in Charlottesville.</p>



<p>While it’s a small fraction of the more than 600,000 COVID-19 deaths in the United States, these numbers raise alarms for some health experts.</p>



<p>“Think about if 300 children had died over the past year from lightning strikes or from shark attacks,” says Taison Bell, a critical care and infectious diseases doctor who directs UVA Health’s medical intensive care unit. “We would be doing things a lot differently when it came to going to the beach or being outside when it was raining.”</p>



<p>Now, the number of <a href="https://downloads.aap.org/AAP/PDF/AAP%20and%20CHA%20-%20Children%20and%20COVID-19%20State%20Data%20Report%208.5%20FINAL.pdf">infections in kids is increasing</a>. From July 30 to August 5, there were 93,824 new COVID-19 cases in children, according to the American Academy of Pediatrics. That&#8217;s up from&nbsp; 71,726 new cases in the last week of July, which nearly doubled the 38,654 cases from the previous week. And as infections rise, the number of hospitalizations and deaths will too. With millions of children infected, “even a small percentage adds up to tens of thousands of children being hospitalized for COVID-19,” Shirley says.</p>



<div class="wp-block-sciencenews-content-sidebar">
<h3>Kid cases</h3>



<p>Overall, children have accounted for about 14 percent of COVID-19 cases since the start of the pandemic. With the delta variant making inroads among unvaccinated people, cases in children are on the rise again. These data are from 49 states (Nebraska stopped reporting cases at the end of June), New York City, Washington, D.C., Puerto Rico and Guam.</p>

</div>



<p>While many kids get away with no symptoms, or with only a few sniffles, for other children, being infected with the coronavirus is life-changing, Pavia said, “If your child is the one who ends up in the ICU for a week, or if your child develops long COVID and flunks out of a semester of school, and doesn’t get to college or loses their athletic scholarship, there’s nothing mild about that.”</p>



<h4>Serious consequences</h4>



<p>Roberta DeBiasi has seen her share of children who are really sick with COVID-19. At Children’s National Hospital in Washington, D.C., where DeBiasi is the chief of pediatric infectious diseases, nearly 2,900 children have been treated for the disease. Of those, more than 550 were hospitalized, and 175 ended up in intensive care.</p>



<p>Nationwide, kids account for 1.3 percent to 3.5 percent of hospitalizations due to COVID-19. Like adults with serious cases of COVID-19, children who end up in the hospital tend to have underlying medical conditions, including obesity, respiratory or lung disease and neuromuscular diseases that make them more susceptible to severe illness.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Another 165 kids have been treated at Children’s National for multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children, or MIS-C. That is a condition in which the immune system kicks up <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coronavirus-covid-19-kids-complications-inflammation-rare-cases">inflammation to such a degree that it can lead to organ failure</a> (<em>SN: 5/12/20</em>). It appears about four to six weeks after an infection with the coronavirus and can happen even in children who had mild cases or no symptoms initially.</p>



<p>There’s no good predictor of which children will develop the condition, DeBiasi says. “Even the sickest kids that are in the intensive care unit, there’s no way you would have said, ‘Oh, my child is at higher risk.’ It’s just a normal child. So that’s what makes it a little bit scary.”</p>



<p>Some medications that calm the immune system help, and many children seem to make full recoveries. But 37 children in the United States have died from the condition as of June 28. Doctors have known about the rare inflammatory condition for only a little over a year, and the long-term implications of MIS-C for children’s health are yet one more mystery to solve. DeBiasi and colleagues have launched <a href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04830852">a study</a> of the long-term effects of the syndrome.</p>



<p>The team is also looking at long COVID in kids. Long COVID can encompass a constellation of symptoms from exhaustion, shortness of breath after activity, loss of taste and smell, problems thinking and memory disturbances that persist for weeks or months. “Even if, overall, those symptoms seem mild, they do have an impact on your quality of life,” DeBiasi says. “If you’re in school and trying to learn, it’s not good to have memory disturbances.”</p>



<p>No one is quite sure how often long COVID strikes kids. DeBiasi’s new three-year study will track more than 1,000 children and young adults who have had COVID-19. Other children in the study participants’ households who didn’t have COVID-19 will be recruited as a control group.</p>



<p>In a study of children in the United Kingdom with COVID-19, the illness usually ran its course in about five to seven days, with younger kids getting better faster. But about 4 percent of children in the study <a href="http://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanchi/article/PIISS2352-4642(21)00198-X/fulltext">still had symptoms a month after falling ill</a>, researchers report August 3 in the <em>Lancet Child &amp; Adolescent Health</em>. That was more likely for adolescents 12- to 17-years-old than for 5- to 11-year-olds. Just under 2 percent of children still had symptoms two months into the illness, the researchers found.</p>



<p>In Switzerland, <a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2782164">about 4 percent of 109 school</a>children who had antibodies indicating they’d previously had COVID-19 had one or more symptoms for at least 12 weeks after the initial illness, researchers reported July 15 in <em>JAMA</em>.</p>



<p>In both studies, kids who had colds or other respiratory illnesses that weren’t COVID-19 sometimes also had symptoms lasting a month or more, suggesting that the coronavirus isn’t the only virus that can have lingering health effects.</p>



<p>How delta will affect children also remains to be seen. Children are now making up a slightly larger percentage of cases than with previous versions of the virus: 19 percent in the last week of July, up from just under 17 percent the week before. Over the entire course of the pandemic, children have accounted for 14.3 percent of all infections, according to the American Academy of Pediatrics.</p>



<p>But that rising share may be because children under 12 can’t be vaccinated yet, and only about 30 percent of 12- to 17-year-olds are fully vaccinated. It doesn’t necessarily mean that children are more susceptible than adults to infection with the virus, they just remain vulnerable.</p>



<p>And though delta is more transmissible, it isn’t yet clear whether it causes more severe illness for children as it appears to for adults. Some doctors are reporting that kids infected with the delta variant are getting sicker. But at Children’s National, “we’re not seeing any difference in how sick the kids get or how often they end up hospitalized with the delta variant than any other,” DeBiasi says.</p>

<p>But even if delta isn’t more dangerous for kids, there’s still basic math to consider: If many more children get sick because of the supercontagious variant, a greater number of kids could face severe or long-term illness.</p>



<p>Some U.S. kids get hit harder than others, regardless of the variant. <a href="https://data.cdc.gov/NCHS/Deaths-by-Race-and-Hispanic-Origin-Ages-0-18-Years/32c3-mvuz">Hispanic or Latino children account for 36 percent of child deaths</a> from COVID-19, even though only 18.5 percent of the U.S. population is Hispanic or Latino. Black children are also overrepresented among child deaths from COVID-19. While 13.4 percent of the U.S. population is Black, about 22 percent of pediatric COVID-19 deaths were Black children.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, Native Hawaiian or other Pacific Islanders make up 0.2 percent of the U.S. population, but 1.4 percent of children who have died of COVID-19 and 1 percent of children with MIS-C come from that group.</p>



<p>Just as with adults, other severe consequences of the illness hit children of color harder too. <a href="https://www.jpeds.com/article/S0022-3476(21)00518-7/fulltext">Black and Latino children were overrepresented</a> among kids treated at Children’s National for MIS-C, DeBiasi and colleagues reported June 25 in the <em>Journal of Pediatrics</em>. Nationally, <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mis/cases/index.html">62 percent</a> of the 4,196 children with confirmed cases of the rare syndrome were Black or Latino, and 60 percent were male.&nbsp;</p>



<h4>Schools’ role</h4>



<p>So will going back to school — a move that many see as crucial to kids’ well-being and learning — make it that much harder to protect children from getting sick and to curb the spread of COVID-19?</p>



<p>Some people worry that as unvaccinated children return to in-person learning, they could catch COVID-19 from their peers and spread the virus to vulnerable adults. But evidence suggests that’s not a given.</p>



<p>Schools aren’t the culprit, says Susi Kriemler, an epidemiologist and pediatrician at the University of Zurich. “I’m a believer that most infections that affect children come from parents in the household,” she says. She and colleagues have collected data to back up that belief. They took blood samples from nearly 3,000 children at 55 schools in the canton of Zurich, looking for antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 that would indicate a prior infection. Samples were collected in three rounds: June to July 2020, October to November 2020 and March to April 2021.</p>



<p>The team then looked for clusters of cases within classrooms that could indicate student-to-student spread. There was no evidence of student-to-student transmission within the classes, the researchers reported July 19 at medRxiv.org. Instead, any clusters of infections in schools <a href="https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.07.19.21260644v1">reflected the rates of COVID-19 being reported in the broader community.</a></p>



<p>That report hasn’t been reviewed by other scientists yet, but it echoes findings from a study of four schools in Orange County, Calif. There, one school had 97 percent of its students learning from home. That school had the <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41390-021-01660-x">highest infection rate</a>, and it coincided with the highest community transmission rate, particularly during the winter surge in 2020, researchers reported July 24 in <em>Pediatric Research</em>. By contrast, another school had 93 percent in-person instruction with high rates of mask-wearing and less than half the community transmission rate of the first school. The in-person school had the lowest infection rate of the four.</p>



<p>But there are some caveats. The mostly in-person school spent about $1,400 per student upgrading the school and implementing anti-COVID measures, which many schools cannot afford. And all of those data were collected before the delta variant sent case counts soaring in many places.</p>



<p>On maps compiled by the CDC, much of the country is now tinted red, <a href="https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#cases_community">indicating high transmission rates with 100 or more people out of every 100,000</a> in an area testing positive for the coronavirus over the last seven days. Most of the rest of the country is orange, for substantial transmission, indicating 50 to 99 people out of every 100,000 getting infected in a seven-day period. Those high infection rates have <a href="https://www.khou.com/article/news/health/coronavirus/church-camp-covid-outbreak-new-breakthrough-cases/285-2a21d58c-a264-42ec-9897-7794f35759c8">spilled over into kids</a> <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/06/30/us/illinois-summer-camp-coronavirus-outbreak/index.html">at summer camps</a>, and some campers brought the virus home, where it spread in their communities.</p>



<div class="wp-block-sciencenews-content-sidebar">
<h3>Hot spots</h3>



<p>Back-to-school time is happening just as most of the United States has high or substantial levels of coronavirus transmission. Red counties are where there are more than 100 cases for every 100,000 people in the last seven days; orange counties have 50 to 99 cases for every 100,000 people in a seven-day period. This snapshot reflects the situation as of August 3. Under such conditions, everyone should wear masks when indoors in public places, especially in schools, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends.</p>

<p>Camp horror stories won’t necessarily be repeated in schools, though. <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coronavirus-covid-air-spread-indoor-clean-ventilation-filtration">Air cleaning, air circulation and wearing masks</a> may cut down on the spread of even the delta variant (<em>SN: 5/18/21</em>), though it’s unclear how widely such measures will be implemented in schools. The CDC recommends that everyone — kids, teachers, administrators, staff, visitors —<a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/cdc-covid-coronavirus-masks-indoors-vaccinated-people-pandemic"> wear masks when in schools</a>, even if fully vaccinated (<em>SN: 7/27/21</em>).</p>



<p>Some places are starting school with mask mandates in place. Other states have banned schools from requiring the protective gear. A patchwork of policies elsewhere leaves it up to parents to decide whether their children should wear masks to school or get vaccinated when eligible.</p>



<p>Still, if everything is done correctly, schools don’t have to be COVID-19 hotbeds. As the researchers studying the four California schools wrote, “We speculate that even at times of high community SARS-CoV-2 prevalence, schools can be among the healthiest places for children to be so long as the right mitigation strategies are in place.”</p>

                <p>Our paper on <a href="http://rdcu.be/creIt">A database and deep learning toolbox for noise-optimized, generalized spike inference from calcium imaging</a> is out now in Nature Neuroscience. It consists of a large and diverse ground truth database with simultaneous calcium imaging and juxtacellular recordings across almost 300 neurons. We used the database to train a supervised algorithm (&#8220;Cascade&#8221;) to infer spike rates from calcium imaging data.</p>



<p>If you are into calcium imaging, here are 5 reasons why you should use Cascade. </p>

<p class="has-medium-font-size"><strong>1. You don&#8217;t have to install it</strong></p>



<p>You are not familiar with Python? Or you don&#8217;t want to install dependencies? No problem. <a href="https://colab.research.google.com/github/HelmchenLabSoftware/Cascade/blob/master/Demo%20scripts/Calibrated_spike_inference_with_Cascade.ipynb">Click this link.</a> The link will bring you to an online interface where you can work with Cascade. You can upload your data (dF/F traces) as *.mat- or *.npy-files and download the results (inferred spike rates). Trying out the package is as quick as it can get. The online interface is a Google Colaboratory and therefore runs on servers provided by Google for free.</p>



<p>However, you can also install Cascade locally on your computer. Just go to the <a href="https://github.com/HelmchenLabSoftware/Cascade">Github page</a> and follow the installation instructions (tested on Ubuntu, Windows and Mac). This might be useful if you want to integrate spike inference into an existing workflow. People including myself have used Cascade together with CaImAn or Suite2p. You can use the dF/F output of these packages and apply the Cascade &#8220;predict&#8221; function as seen in the demo scripts. It&#8217;s a single-line addition of code to your pipeline.</p>



<p>Personally, I used Cascade with a GPU for the analyses in the paper. For daily work with calcium imaging recordings in mice (typically a few hours of recordings and a few hundreds of neurons), I run it on a computer without dedicated GPU because it&#8217;s fast enough on any reasonable CPU (seconds to minutes). Sometimes, I also use the online Colaboratory Notebook. The results are identical, whether I use a local installation or the Notebook, since the code is identical.</p>



<p></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"><strong>2. You don&#8217;t have to tune parameters</strong></p>



<p>For each neuron from a data set, the algorithm automatically detects the noise level and chooses an appropriately trained model. The models are trained across many different conditions and indicators. This broadly trained model ideally generalizes to unseen data. Check out <a href="http://rdcu.be/creIt">Figure 3 in the paper</a> if you want to know more about the details.</p>



<p>To get started, you have to choose a model based on the frame rate of your recordings and on the temporal resolution that you want to achieve with spike inference. The FAQ, which can be found both on the <a href="https://github.com/HelmchenLabSoftware/Cascade">Github Readme</a> and at the end of the <a href="https://colab.research.google.com/github/HelmchenLabSoftware/Cascade/blob/master/Demo%20scripts/Calibrated_spike_inference_with_Cascade.ipynb">Colab Notebook</a>, give you guidance if any doubts remain.</p>



<p></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"><strong>3. Estimate absolute spike rates</strong></p>



<p>Have you ever wondered whether a specific calcium transient corresponded to a single action potential or a burst of many action potentials? At least it would be nice to have some estimate of spike rates for a given recording. Cascade gives you this estimate.</p>



<p>The next question is a bit more tricky: how precise is that estimate? &#8211; It is as exact as it can get if you apply an algorithm to calcium imaging data where you do not have an associated ground truth. We have quantified this precision in the paper in terms of correlation (=variance explained), absolute errors and typical biases (see Figure 3 and Extended Data Figure 4). In the end, the typical errors depend on the data quality and noise levels. However, you should expect that the true spike rate might be as low as 0.5 times or as high as 2.0 times the spike rate estimated by Cascade. On average across neurons, the error will be lower. This is not single-spike precision, but, as bad as it sounds, this is as good as it gets. The imprecision is, among other things, due to the unpredictable heterogeneity of the spike-calcium-relationship across neurons.</p>



<p>However, absolute estimates with a certain imprecision, which you get from Cascade, are still better than results that do not have an immediate meaning (dF/F scores).</p>



<p></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"><strong></strong><strong>4. Improve temporal precision</strong></p>



<p>Spike inference, also referred to as temporal &#8220;deconvolution&#8221; of calcium recordings, improves the temporal resolution by getting rid of the slow calcium transient. The slower the calcium transient, the more pronounced the improvement of deconvolution. And, yes, the algorithm generalizes well across short and long time constants.</p>



<p>Applications where I have used Cascade myself to achieve improved temporal resolution:</p>



<p>a) Detection of fast sequences on a sub-second time scale (check out <a href="http://rdcu.be/creIt">Figure 5e in our toolbox paper</a>)</p>



<p>b) Detection of swimming-locked neuronal activity in <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41592-020-0759-2">head-fixed adult zebrafish</a>. Adult zebrafish move on a sub-second time scale, faster than the calcium indicators we used in their brains at room temperature. </p>



<p>c) Locking of neuronal activity to oscillations in the hippocampus (ongoing work, not yet published).</p>



<p>If your observations are masked by slow indicator transients, give it a shot and try out Cascade.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"><strong>5. </strong><strong>De-noise your recordings</strong></p>



<p>When I used Cascade for the first time, I was surprised how well it de-noised recordings. The <a href="http://rdcu.be/creIt">Cascade paper</a> is full of examples where this is validated with ground truth.</p>



<p>Or, have a look at the spike rate predictions for the Allen Brain Observatory data set (Figure 6b,f,g,h; Extended Data Figure 10). Shot noise is removed, and slower transients due to movement artifacts are rejected. The algorithm simply has learned very well how an action potential looks like.</p>

<p>One of the most striking examples, however, was when we tested the effect of Cascade on population imaging analyses (Supplementary Figure 11, the only figure not yet included in the preprint). To this end, we used NAOMi to simulate neuronal population patterns and analyzed how well the correlations between neuron pairs were predicted from dF/F traces (red) or from spike rates inferred with Cascade (blue). For dF/F traces, correlations were often overestimated (among other reasons due to slow calcium transients) and underestimated (due to overwhelming noise). Pairwise correlation computed from Cascade&#8217;s spike rates are simply closer to the true correlations.</p>

<p>Therefore, if you want to get the best out of your 2P calcium imaging data, I would recommend to use Cascade. The result is simply closer to the true neuronal activity.</p>

<p>Public indignation over litter and garbage has caused industry to ask chemists whether self-destroying, or quickly degradable, plastics might be devised to replace indestructible … glass, aluminum and plastics, which comprise the largest segment of consumer waste.… [Chemist James] Guillet and his team … devised a self-destroying plastic that is about ready for marketing — a wrapping paper that disintegrates in about a month.</p>



<h4>Update </h4>



<p>Guillet’s work on polymers that degrade via light helped pave the way for their wider commercial use. But these materials may have created more problems than they solved. Most plastics <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/chemistry-recycling-plastic-landfills-trash-materials">wind up in landfills</a> where the materials don’t get enough light to degrade as intended (<em>SN: 1/30/21, p. 20</em>). Plastics that do break down turn into microscopic pieces that can wind up in ecosystems and harm animals. Scientists are trying to make more eco-friendly plastics, such as <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/plastic-compost-new-enzyme-technique-biodegradable">compostable plastics</a> that can be totally broken down with enzymes (<em>SN: 6/5/21, p. 5</em>).</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coronavirus-covid-music-wind-instruments-spread-transmission">What science tells us about reducing coronavirus spread from wind instruments</a></h4>

              
                <p>The last time I played clarinet with my band was on March 10, 2020. It was a typical Tuesday evening rehearsal: About 10 musicians crowded into a small basement room, sipping beers and chatting between tunes. Brass instruments, woodwinds and drums blared, with bass lines audible from the stairwell.</p>



<p>Since 2004, the Rude Mechanical Orchestra has practiced in the same space, a couple of blocks from the East River in Brooklyn, N.Y. The room is cramped — chairs and music stands crowd every corner, shelves are crammed with instruments and sheet music. With no windows or AC units, air circulation is minimal.</p>



<p>When I walked up the stairs after practice, I had no idea that the space we’d filled with boisterous pop covers and protest tunes would sit quiet for more than a year. The COVID-19 pandemic shut down the world in March 2020, isolating musicians like me from the art we love. Millions of high school and college musicians were barred from their band rooms, children’s lessons were canceled and professionals lost performance opportunities and income streams.</p>

<p>Though restrictions are now easing, we still face questions about how our instruments play into infection risk. Wind instruments — brasses as well as woodwinds like my clarinet — produce sound through human breath. And human breath spreads COVID-19. So how can we perform while keeping ourselves and our audiences safe, during the pandemic and beyond? To find answers, wind musicians, including myself, turned to science.</p>



<h4>An ill wind</h4>



<p>The hazards of live music hit home when <a href="https://www.livescience.com/covid-19-superspreader-singing.html">news broke</a> of a superspreader event among members of the Skagit Valley Chorale in Washington state. On March 10 — the same day as my band’s final rehearsal — 61 members had gathered to sing. By the time Gov. Jay Inslee instituted a stay-at-home order two weeks later, 52 members of the choir had either tested positive for the new coronavirus or were assumed to have it. Three singers were hospitalized, and two died.</p>



<p>The group had been careful, avoiding physical contact such as handshakes and hugs, putting plenty of space between their chairs and using hand sanitizer. At that time, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and other public health agencies were primarily telling people to avoid close contact and contaminated surfaces to reduce transmission risks. But many musicians quickly realized that something else was going on.</p>



<p>“When we saw the Skagit Valley choir spread, we knew right away that [the coronavirus] was spreading via aerosol,” says Mark Spede, director of bands at Clemson University in South Carolina. He is one of the lead researchers on a coalition that developed COVID-19 protocols for performing arts students. It was “pretty clear,” he says, that the virus was spreading through the air. On May 15, 2020, Skagit County health department staff reported in <em>Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report</em> that <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/69/wr/mm6919e6.htm">the “act of singing, itself, might have contributed to transmission</a> through emission of aerosols.”</p>



<p>I quickly realized that wind instruments like mine had to pose a similar danger. To play it safe, most wind musicians stopped playing together. My band briefly entertained the idea of practicing outside, but as New York City shut down, we switched to virtual rehearsals. These meetings were a poor substitute for in-person sessions. As anyone who’s tried to sing “Happy Birthday” over Zoom can tell you, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/video-call-zoom-pandemic-popularity-phone-tech-history">videocalling platforms</a> just don’t cut it for music practice. These platforms are built to highlight one speaker at a time, creating a painful lag in sound when people try to sing or play simultaneously (<em>SN: 4/24/21, p. 22</em>).</p>



<p>“School band shut down,” recalls 16-year-old Hannah Scheuer, a bandmate of mine and a student in the New York City public school system. Unable to enter the school building for months, classmates who rented instruments from the school couldn’t bring them home to practice. A survey conducted in late April by Spede and colleagues revealed that out of 30,000 U.S. high school and college music programs, <a href="https://www.nfhs.org/media/4701205/draft-30-assessing-the-risk-of-music-activities-during-covid.pdf">about one-third had no in-person rehearsals</a> through the end of the 2020–2021 school year.</p>

<h4>Musicians in studies</h4>



<p>Facing a lockdown without the camaraderie of rehearsals, musicians wanted answers about the risks their instruments might pose in spreading COVID-19. Some went as far as becoming study subjects to find out.</p>



<p>The Minneapolis-based Minnesota Orchestra, for instance, reached out to Jiarong Hong, a mechanical engineer at the nearby University of Minnesota. A <a href="https://twin-cities.umn.edu/news-events/new-study-explores-how-coronavirus-travels-indoors">July 2020 release of his study on indoor transmission of the coronavirus</a> had drawn media attention; the study was later <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0021850220301476">published</a> in the January 2021 <em>Journal of Aerosol Science</em>. Catching wind of this work, the orchestra asked Hong and colleagues to “provide scientifically driven guidelines to help them get back to their work safely,” Hong says. His lab set up experiments with the musicians, which led to one of the first studies on the subject.</p>



<p>Engineer Lia Becher at the Bauhaus-Universität Weimar in Germany had an experience similar to Hong’s. When a colleague’s video demonstrating how air spreads after a cough went viral, musicians asked Becher and her lab group how air would spread out of their instruments. So she worked with local musicians to meticulously track the dispersion of air from instruments with mouthpieces.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, Spede and James Weaver, director of performing arts and sports for the National Federation of State High School Associations in Indianapolis, <a href="https://www.nfhs.org/articles/unprecedented-international-coalition-led-by-performing-arts-organizations-to-commission-covid-19-study/">convened a group of concerned music teachers and arts organizations</a>. They worked with mechanical engineers at the University of Colorado Boulder and the University of Maryland in College Park to study the risks posed by different performance activities, in the hopes of bringing students back to classrooms for fall 2020.</p>



<p>These studies and others like them fall into two categories, notes Juliette O’Keeffe, an environmental health scientist at the National Collaborating Centre for Environmental Health in Vancouver. Some, she explains, visualize the air coming out of an instrument (a qualitative method), while others measure properties of the air particles that emerge, such as size, concentration and distance traveled (a quantitative method). O’Keeffe conducted a <a href="https://ncceh.ca/sites/default/files/COVID-19 Risks and precautions for the performing arts.pdf">review of studies that examined aerosols emitted from instruments</a> and she posted her findings on her institution’s website on September 23, 2020.</p>



<p>Becher and colleagues employed qualitative methods, visualizing the air with a special mirror called a schlieren mirror. Using the temperature and pressure differences between static air and exhaled air, the mirror turns air patterns into visual light patterns. Videos produced by Becher’s team <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cEJhHf-zpHE&amp;list=PL9DGkx-EA5-EiKNMBeVVwFzuukZHvpEmm&amp;index=2">show exactly how air comes out of different instruments</a>, in what looks like roiling puffs of smoke.</p>

</div><figcaption><br>When a musician blows into their instrument, air particles escape through the instrument and the musician’s mouth. In these three clips, a schlieren mirror visualizes, via temperature and pressure change, how particles escape a flute, a trumpet, and a bass clarinet.</figcaption></figure>



<p>Hong’s lab followed quantitative methods, <a href="https://tsi.com/products/particle-sizers/particle-size-spectrometers/aerodynamic-particle-sizer-(aps)-spectrometer-3321/">using an aerodynamic particle sizer</a> — a special spectrometer that measures the diameters of tiny particles. These instruments can determine the sizes of <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coronavirus-covid-air-spread-indoor-clean-ventilation-filtration">aerosols that may spread the coronavirus</a> (<em>SN Online: 5/18/21</em>).</p>



<p>Spede and Weaver’s collaborators used both quantitative and qualitative methods. This included the schlieren mirror and measurements taken in a dedicated aerosol testing room with a ventilation system that allows engineers to isolate the aerosols that emerged from the various instruments.</p>



<h4>Which winds pose the highest risks?</h4>



<p>For singers, all air comes directly out of the windpipe. But for wind musicians, once the air leaves the windpipe, its travel pattern depends on the instrument.</p>



<p>Hong’s team <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0021850220301555">measured these patterns with musicians from the Minnesota Orchestra</a>. The study’s findings, which he also published in the January 2021 <em>Journal of Aerosol Science</em>, measured risk by comparing the size and concentration of air particles dispersed by musicians with those emitted when a person speaks. Tubas were lowest risk, producing fewer particles than a person speaking. Flutes, French horns and larger woodwinds released similar levels of aerosols as a speaking person. Oboes, trombones and especially trumpets were all higher risk, spreading more aerosols than a person speaking.</p>



<p>Hong’s research provides specific aerosol sizes and concentration measurements for individual instruments. But this work, like other studies in this field, used very small sample sizes of one or two musicians to characterize an instrument’s air dispersion.</p>

<p>Such a small sample size can be particularly challenging when investigating woodwinds. While brass instruments are easy to evaluate, because all air goes straight from the mouthpiece to the bell, woodwinds get complicated. When I play my clarinet, aerosols have several escape routes: the flared opening at the instrument’s end, the keyholes and the space where my lips meet the reed — the thin piece of wood that vibrates against the clarinet’s mouthpiece to create sound. What’s more, small differences between clarinet players’ techniques can have a big impact on the speeds and concentrations of aerosols that players release.</p>



<p>In one trial by Hong’s team, one clarinet player produced five times as many aerosols as a second clarinet player. Hong hypothesizes that this difference is because one player used a “harder” clarinet reed, typically used by more experienced musicians. This reed is stiffer and requires more air to produce a sound. The way a clarinet player positions her mouth around her instrument may also affect aerosol generation, Hong explains.</p>



<p>Like Hong’s research, Becher’s work and preliminary findings from Spede and Weaver’s studies suggest that trumpets, trombones, clarinets and oboes spread more aerosols farther out into performance spaces, while larger instruments, particularly tubas, pose lower risks. The long, circuitous tubes in larger instruments trap breath-propelled particles and reduce the speed of those that do escape — in other words, you’re less likely to catch COVID-19 if you stand in front of a tuba player than if you stick your head into a tuba’s bell.</p>



<p>Although more research is needed, current studies nonetheless suggest that in most cases playing a wind instrument is about as likely (or even less likely) to transmit the coronavirus as loud talking or singing. The air is just traveling through your instrument’s tubing, rather than going straight out of your mouth. And there are ways to reduce risk.</p>





<h4>Safety tips</h4>



<p>While Hong, Becher and other scientists researched particle dispersion from wind instruments, music nonetheless returned to the streets of New York in summer 2020, with many musicians inspired to support Black Lives Matter protests across the city. Eager to join the movement, the Rude Mechanical Orchestra began looking at studies, deliberating how to be safe. I and three other science-minded performers formed a COVID-19 committee.</p>



<p>Evaluating the literature was tricky. In an August 2020 e-mail exchange, committee member Phil Andrews sent the band a preprint from medRxiv.org, which <a href="https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.31.20165837v1?fbclid=IwAR3fRbIH_K1NbzThfPR2Eje4t4iA-kQPMr1O0ZAe_tbI2vH5LHwqK5i0L0A">suggested that fabric covers be stretched over brass instruments’ bells</a> — the flared openings through which sound emerges. I wrote back with caution, noting that the study included only eight participants. Everything seemed preliminary, and because many of our bandmates have health conditions or families to look after, we opted for more caution. Until we knew more, we’d play only percussion instruments — outside.</p>



<p>Other musicians I spoke with remembered scouring the CDC’s website for any mention of wind instruments and carefully reading preprints in subjects that they had never studied. Benjamin Yates, a trombone instructor at the University of Louisiana in Lafayette, recalls an instance of intense research over the summer: “I was sitting at my computer and I had all these tabs open, and I’m looking up really basic terms, like ventilation — what does ventilation actually mean, scientifically?”</p>



<p>Yates’ and my efforts to align group practices with scientific recommendations reflected a broader trend across the nation to find safe ways to play music. While some musicians opted to stay in lockdown, others moved rehearsals and performances outside, often using makeshift bell covers or musician masks with space for a mouthpiece. A mask with a hole in it might seem odd, but research led by Spede and Weaver shows that these masks reduce aerosol spread from the sides of musicians’ mouths as they blow into their instruments. This is especially key for younger musicians who have less control over their mouth positioning.</p>



<p>Formulating safe strategies for musicians became especially important as U.S. school programs prepared for the 2020 fall semester. For Spede and Weaver, time was ticking on their project to build guidelines for student musicians. Preliminary investigations by engineers at the Universities of Colorado and Maryland provided the information they needed. This study, which included <a href="https://scholar.colorado.edu/concern/articles/hq37vp75r">12 performers playing nine different instruments</a>, was published as a preprint on the University of Colorado’s website in April 2021. Before publication, however, Spede and Weaver’s team used the findings to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u46GJAnpZ7k">devise detailed risk mitigation guidelines</a>.</p>



<div class="wp-block-sciencenews-content-sidebar">
<h3>Safe schools&nbsp;</h3>



<p>The vast majority of high school and college bands that followed five recommendations from the National Federation of State and High School Associations rehearsed without spreading the coronavirus between students.</p>



<h6>Protocols to reduce risk of COVID-19 transmission</h6>



<figure class="wp-block-table"><table><tbody><tr><td><strong>Masks &amp; covers</strong></td><td>Masks on students<br>Bell covers on instruments<br>Surgical mask material or double layers for both</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Distance</strong></td><td>6-foot distance between players<br>Trombone needs 9-by-6-foot distance<br>Applies indoors and outdoors</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Time</strong></td><td>30-minute rehearsal limit indoors/60 minutes outdoors<br>Clear room for minimum of one air change before next rehearsal period</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Air flow</strong></td><td>Outdoors is best; open windows and doors if indoors<br>HEPA filtration<br>Maximize air change rates</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Hygiene</strong></td><td>Empty spit valves into buckets with alcohol solution<br>Wash hands frequently</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>
</div>



<p>At the end of the 2020–2021 school year, Spede and Weaver <a href="https://www.nfhs.org/media/4701205/draft-30-assessing-the-risk-of-music-activities-during-covid.pdf">surveyed U.S. high school and college music programs</a>. Of 3,000 programs that responded, about 2,800 reported using some or all of the guidelines for bands, choirs or orchestras. Among those schools that responded, coronavirus spread was almost nonexistent. Eight programs each reported a case of coronavirus spread between musicians: five in choirs, two in bands and one in an orchestra. Seven of the eight cases involved one person infecting a single other person; two of the cases occurred at schools that did not use any of the recommended safety guidelines.</p>



<p>“With hundreds or thousands of hours of rehearsal and millions of people participating,” Weaver says, “the fact that we’ve had [so few] cases of spread, we’re pretty confident in the mitigations.” Spede and Weaver believe these protocols could be useful beyond the pandemic, for instance, during cold and flu seasons and other infectious disease outbreaks.</p>



<p>In addition to Spede and Weaver’s guidelines, musicians may consider reorganizing where they sit onstage. A modeling study by researchers at the University of Utah in Salt Lake City, based on Hong’s measurements, suggests that moving percussion instruments toward the center of the stage and putting the highest-risk winds near vents that pull air from the room can cut aerosol accumulation. The Utah Symphony, which collaborated with the University of Utah researchers on this study, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coronavirus-covid-musicians-relocating-reduce-risk-concerts">adopted this recommendation</a> for its spring 2021 concert season (<em>SN Online: 6/23/21</em>).</p>



<p>O’Keeffe also suggests that musicians monitor COVID-19 transmission rates in their communities, so they know the likelihood that a person with COVID-19 is present. Disease-tracking metrics used by the Brown University School of Public Health in Providence, R.I., indicate that more than <a href="https://globalepidemics.org/key-metrics-for-covid-suppression/">10 new cases a day for every 100,000 people</a> in a region constitutes higher risk. Musicians may feel safer, too, when more than 70 percent of their community is fully vaccinated, adopting the vaccination goal from the White House COVID-19 task force.</p>



<h4>An industry transformed</h4>



<p>When I asked musicians how COVID-19 changed their musical activity, their answers reflected both the economic and emotional fallout of last spring’s lockdowns.</p>



<p>“Before COVID, I was working at my [former] high school as a school aide while giving lessons there as well,” says Elijah Herring, a saxophone student who graduated from New York’s Brooklyn College this spring. “Because the school system closed down, I lost my job. I wasn’t able to get unemployment benefits until June or July.… I had to street perform to make ends meet, to pay bills, to take care of my mom.”</p>



<p>In the short term, COVID-19 was a blow to the music world. Musicians lost income as well as motivation to practice or compose; some left the industry altogether. But in the long term, the pandemic has transformed how many musicians think about their profession.</p>



<p>“Music is a privilege,” says Orion White, a saxophone student at the University of Idaho in Moscow. “It’s something that really sticks with you; it changes you. It can be almost religious if you let it be, and I took that for granted. Not anymore.”</p>



<p>This sentiment is heightened by the layers of added challenge needed to play — any performance, group practice or even informal jam session now requires intensive safety and trust. Before they can start playing, musicians must trust each other with their vaccination status and other health information. I’ve led discussions in my own band, developing practice guidelines that incorporate health needs and risk comfort levels.</p>

<p>Audiences seem to acknowledge the effort that goes into performing. Andrews and Herring both say that they’re getting more money from busking now than they did before the pandemic.</p>



<p>The Rude Mechanical Orchestra had our first pandemic practice that included wind instruments on May 18 this year. We gathered outside, by the river, a few blocks away from our old basement practice space.</p>



<p>We had agreed to strict guidelines — all wind players had to be fully vaccinated, with masks and bell covers on. So only four people opted to play a wind instrument. Still, a tuba, two trombones, a clarinet and a lot of percussion was enough to bring melodies to life. We played through some of our classic tunes, pausing to talk through song structure and enjoy the breeze.</p>



<p>At one point, a small girl with a loose ponytail approached us and began dancing to the music. She didn’t know that we were out of practice or that half of the drummers were trained in other instruments. But her dance echoed our joy in being back together.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/squirrel-jump-leap-tree-branch-parkour-tricks">Squirrels use parkour tricks when leaping from branch to branch</a></h4>

              
                <p>Parkour enthusiasts need look no further than up in the trees for inspiration. Squirrels’ aerial acrobatics make the rodents masters of the form, a new study suggests.</p>



<p>A detailed look at how squirrels navigate narrow branches that bend and sway with the wind — where the smallest error could spell death — shows that the rodents make split-second calculations to balance trade-offs between branch bendiness and the distance between tree limbs. And for particularly tricky jumps, <a href="https://science.sciencemag.org/lookup/doi/10.1126/science.abe5753">squirrels improvise parkour-style moves</a> in midair to stick the landing, researchers report in the Aug. 6 <em>Science.</em></p>



<p>This study is “a great example of how cool ‘normal’ animals can be in their biomechanics,” says Michelle Graham, a graduate student in biomechanics at Virginia Tech in Blacksburg who was not involved with the research. “We’ve all seen squirrels do crazy stuff in nature, but no one ever pays any attention to it.”</p>



<p>That is unless you’re like Nathaniel Hunt, who has been mesmerized by watching squirrels flash through the overstory since graduate school. “Tree canopies are incredibly challenging environments to navigate,” says Hunt, an integrative biologist at the University of Nebraska Omaha. When jumping between bendy branches, a squirrel must assess how far it has to jump and know when to leap. Jump too early and the squirrel will fall short. Too late, and the squirrel will find itself on a branch too flimsy from which to launch. Hunt wondered, “How are they sensitive to that trade-off, managing to make accurate leaps?”&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>





<p>To find out, he and his colleagues designed an artificial forest obstacle course on the outskirts of the University of California, Berkeley campus. Then, the team used peanuts to coax free-ranging <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/scientists-name-66-species-potential-biodiversity-threats-eu">fox squirrels</a> (<em>Sciurus niger</em>) into running and jumping through a series of acrobatic tests (<em>SN: 1/29/19</em>).</p>



<p>First, the unwitting subjects learned to leap from artificial branches of high, medium or low stiffness across a gap to reach a prize: a basket of peanuts at the end of a landing peg. High-speed video captured details of the jumps, from launch point to landing accuracy, for 12 squirrels spanning 96 leaping trials.</p>



<p>Unsurprisingly, the squirrels leaped from more bendy branches earlier — presumably to maximize jumping force — even though that increased the distance that the animals must clear, Hunt says. By comparing what the squirrels actually did with statistical models that simulated optimal jumping decisions, the researchers found something interesting: Branch flexibility had about six times as great an influence on when squirrels decided to jump as did the length of the gap. If squirrels had cared more about distance, they’d have jumped from about the same spot on the rod, regardless of its give. “We were surprised to see squirrels weighing both of these things simultaneously, but in different amounts,” Hunt says.</p>



<p>The researchers upped the ante for five squirrels by increasing the flexibility of branches as well as gap distance. Initial leaps were less than graceful. No squirrels fell, but most landed clunkily at first, grasping the peg they leaped to with their front paws and swinging around to pull themselves up instead of landing neatly on all fours. But within five trials, “squirrels learned to compensate for their initial error,” Hunt says, which they did by modifying their initial velocity.</p>

</div><figcaption>To better understand how squirrels leap from tree branch to tree branch without falling, researchers trained free-roaming squirrels to jump through a series of tests in an artificial forest obstacle course. High-speed camera footage showed that these rodents can learn to stick landings in just a few jumps, and that squirrels consider both branch bendiness and distance when deciding to leap from a limb.</figcaption></figure>



<p>If squirrels regularly encounter the same branches, such quick learning “might explain how they move so fluidly and rapidly” across particular branches, Hunt explains. The rodents might be such quick navigators, he says, because “they’ve already learned what they need to know about that branch.”</p>



<p>The squirrels surprised the researchers in other ways too. For longer jumps, or those that necessitated landing higher or lower than the starting point, many squirrels rotated midair, using their legs to “jump” off an adjacent vertical wall in a parkour-style maneuver. More often than not, squirrels employed parkour to slow down if they were coming in too hot to a landing. “It’s an additional point of control,” Hunt says.</p>



<p>For many arboreal animals, “jumping between limbs is such a common thing, and yet we so frequently only study it in pieces,” Graham says, such as looking just at the launch but not the landing. This study&#8217;s holistic look reveals “something really interesting about squirrels, that they take greater account of [branch bendiness] than the gap distance,” she notes. “I don’t know that I would’ve guessed that.”</p>

                <p><em>By </em><a href="http://emilyoliviareynolds.com/">Emily Reynolds</a></p>



<p>The world is full of fascinating opportunities to learn. But with so many different topics for children to explore, why do they pick certain paths? In a <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0956797621994230">new paper</a> in <em>Psychological Science, </em>a team from Rutgers University looks closely at what drives children’s curiosity. They find that children are motivated to learn more about a topic when there is a gap in their knowledge that they want to fill. The results suggest that for young children there is a sweet spot for learning, when they already know enough to find a topic interesting, but not so much that it becomes boring.</p>



<span id="more-43143"></span>



<p>In the first study, fifty children aged around five years old were assessed on their existing knowledge in three areas: biological transmission of illness, psychosomatic events, and theory of mind (understanding other people’s mental states). In the biological transmission domain, for example, children heard stories about a character who sneezed, and were asked whether a friend would also catch the illness, while in the psychosomatic domain they were asked if somebody’s cheeks could redden from embarrassment.</p>



<p>Next, participants were presented with choose your own adventure stories, where a character experienced a similar event to the one given in the knowledge assessment task and one that was irrelevant and unrelated. Participants then selected which event they wanted to hear the end of. In the biological transmission scenario, for example, participants read that a character had played with a friend with a cold. At the end of the story, the children were asked if they wanted to find out whether the character had picked up the cold or, instead, what he had for breakfast.</p>



<p>Based on their responses to the initial questions, children were classified as having either “mature” or “immature” levels of knowledge for each of the three areas. The team found that those with more knowledge showed no particular preference for either scenario when reading the story, but those with <em>immature</em> theories were more likely to select the ending that was related to the first part of the study.</p>



<p>This could be because the ending related to the first set of scenarios offered the children a chance to learn something new after their interest was initially piqued, the team suggests. Those who had a more mature understanding of the initial scenarios may have already known &#8220;too much&#8221; about them to find them particularly compelling, or were already certain enough about their knowledge to not feel the need to explore further.</p>



<p>The results were replicated in a second study, in which just 58% of children with mature theories chose the story ending related to the first part of the study, compared to 68% of those with immature theories (though the difference here was not significant). Interestingly, children who were in neither category, and instead were in an in-between group, transitioning from immature to mature theories, were far more likely to choose this option: 80% of children in this group selected the ending more closely related to the initial scenarios.</p>



<p>The results suggest that children use uncertainty when deciding what to learn about, the team says. When children are uncertain about things, they seek more information to resolve that uncertainty. This in turn informs their learning (and may go some way to explain why children often ask endless “Why?” questions).</p>



<p>The findings could help parents and teachers encourage children to learn more about particular topics, providing them with more information when they are at an intermediate stage of curiosity. Looking out for this particular knowledge gap, when interest is piqued, could be the starting point for further learning.</p>

<p>When I first learned, as a teenager, that this untold world of particles existed, I couldn’t stop thinking about it. And when I thought about it, I could barely breathe. I was, to steal a metaphor from writer David Foster Wallace, a fish who has only just noticed she’s swimming in water. The revelation that we’re stewing in a particle soup is why I went on to study physics, and eventually, to write about it.</p>



<p>To truly fathom matter at its most fundamental level, people must be able to visualize this hidden world. That’s where particle detectors come in. They spot traces of the universe’s most minuscule constituents, making these intangible concepts real. What’s more, particle detectors reveal beauty: Particles leave behind graceful spirals of bubbles, flashes of light and crisp lines of sparks.</p>

<p>As a physics student, I spent hours examining these stunning pictures in my textbooks. I went on to build particle detectors in graduate school, and to make my own images of particles wending their way through our world.</p>



<p>As a particle moves through a material, it drops bread crumbs that can give away its path. Those bread crumbs come in a variety of forms: light, heat or electric charge. “Basically, every particle detector that exists is looking for one or more of those three things,” says particle physicist Jennifer Raaf of Fermilab in Batavia, Ill. Particle detectors translate the bread crumbs into signals that can be recorded and analyzed. Such signals helped reveal the physics of the standard model, a crowning achievement of science that describes the particles and forces of nature. They’re also likely to be key in the discovery of physics <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/muon-physics-standard-model-particles">beyond the standard model</a>.</p>





<p>As time has passed, technologies for detecting particles have vastly improved. Here are a few types of detectors that have made the invisible visible.</p>





<h4>Through a cloud</h4>



<p>One of the first ways scientists visualized particle tracks was with cloud chambers. Developed more than a century ago, cloud chambers are filled with a gas — often a vapor of alcohol — on the verge of condensing into liquid. When a charged particle passes through the chamber, it strips electrons from the air within, creating an electric charge that initiates condensation. A wispy line forms along the particle’s path, like a miniature contrail.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="456" height="450" src="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/100-atoms_spotlight_tracks_cloudchamber-tracks-456x450.jpg" alt="black and white image of positron particle track" class="wp-image-3101228" srcset="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/100-atoms_spotlight_tracks_cloudchamber-tracks-456x450.jpg 456w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/100-atoms_spotlight_tracks_cloudchamber-tracks-388x383.jpg 388w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/100-atoms_spotlight_tracks_cloudchamber-tracks-188x186.jpg 188w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/100-atoms_spotlight_tracks_cloudchamber-tracks-588x580.jpg 588w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/100-atoms_spotlight_tracks_cloudchamber-tracks.jpg 680w" sizes="(max-width: 456px) 100vw, 456px" /><figcaption><span class="caption wp-caption-3101228">A particle track in a cloud chamber in the early 1930s was the first evidence of a positron, a positively charged particle with the mass of an electron.&nbsp;The track is curved due to a magnetic field that surrounded the chamber.</span><span class="credit wp-credit-3101228">C. D. Anderson, courtesy of Emilio Segrè Visual Archives</span></figcaption></figure></div>



<p>Scientists often surround cloud chambers and other detectors with a strong magnetic field, which bends particles’ paths into curves or spirals. Negatively charged particles curve in one direction, positive particles go the opposite way. Other details further characterize the particle: The amount of curvature indicates a particle’s momentum, for example.</p>



<p>Cloud chambers revealed a variety of previously unknown particles, including the positron and the muon, a heavy cousin of the electron, in the 1930s. These particles were mostly unexpected. At the time, physicists were <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/century/atom-matter-neutron-nuclear-power-fusion">barely coming to grips</a> with the fact that particles besides electrons and protons existed.</p>



<p>Cloud chambers are simple enough that you can <a href="https://home.cern/news/news/experiments/how-make-your-own-cloud-chamber">make one in your own home</a>, using alcohol and dry ice.</p>

<h4>Bubble trails</h4>



<p>The 1950s were all about bubble chambers.</p>



<p>When charged particles pass through liquid in a bubble chamber, they leave tiny vapor bubbles, like iridescent orbs trailing a soap bubble wand. Although the chambers are typically filled with liquid hydrogen, a variety of liquids can be used; one early prototype even used beer. Bubble chambers could be made bigger than cloud chambers, and produced sharper tracks, making it possible to observe more particles in more detail.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" width="680" height="480" src="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/100-atoms_spotlight_tracks_bubble_tracks.jpg" alt="black and white image of a kaon particle track" class="wp-image-3101220" srcset="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/100-atoms_spotlight_tracks_bubble_tracks.jpg 680w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/100-atoms_spotlight_tracks_bubble_tracks-543x383.jpg 543w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/100-atoms_spotlight_tracks_bubble_tracks-638x450.jpg 638w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/100-atoms_spotlight_tracks_bubble_tracks-264x186.jpg 264w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><figcaption><span class="caption wp-caption-3101220">A subatomic particle called a kaon decays into other particles that leave distinct spirals in this bubble chamber image from the 1970s.</span><span class="credit wp-credit-3101220">CERN</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>In the same decade, particle accelerators came to the fore. These accelerators produce energetic beams of particles that scientists can crash into other particles or into targets. Those collisions whip up a flurry of new particles. Scientists sent those beams into bubble chambers to watch what happened.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" width="680" height="480" src="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/100-atoms_spotlight_tracks_bubble_detector.jpg" alt="black and white image of the Big European Bubble Chamber" class="wp-image-3101219" srcset="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/100-atoms_spotlight_tracks_bubble_detector.jpg 680w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/100-atoms_spotlight_tracks_bubble_detector-543x383.jpg 543w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/100-atoms_spotlight_tracks_bubble_detector-638x450.jpg 638w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/100-atoms_spotlight_tracks_bubble_detector-264x186.jpg 264w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><figcaption><span class="caption wp-caption-3101219">The Big European Bubble Chamber, pictured during installation of the vessel, started up at CERN near Geneva in 1973.</span><span class="credit wp-credit-3101219">CERN</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>The resulting images were not only scientifically illuminating, they were stunning: If Raaf were going to get a tattoo, she says, it might be a bubble chamber image. I’ve so far resisted the temptation to get ink.</p>



<h4>Going digital</h4>



<p>Cloud chambers and bubble chambers had a drawback. Tracks were typically recorded with photographs, and each had to be inspected by eye for anything of interest. That process was too slow; it held physicists back from discovering the particles that might show up in only one or two out of myriad photographs, if that. To find the rarest of particles, “you can’t really be looking at pictures. You want to have that information digitized in a smart way,” says Sam Zeller, a particle physicist at Fermilab.</p>

Kalmus, UA1 Experiment/Science Source</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>Enter the multiwire proportional chamber. Invented in 1968, this technology relies on a fine array of high-voltage wires, which record charge produced when incoming particles dislodge electrons from atoms in a gas-filled chamber. This technique could capture millions of particle tracks per second, much more than bubble chambers could achieve. And the data went directly to a computer for analysis. Multiwire proportional chambers and their descendants revolutionized particle physics, and led to discoveries of particles such as the charm quark and the gluon in the 1970s, and the W and&nbsp;Z bosons in the 1980s.</p>

<p>Some of the most advanced modern detectors trace their lineage back to multiwire proportional chambers, such as liquid argon time projection chambers. These detectors are high-resolution, meaning that researchers can zoom in on the details of an interaction and visualize it in 3-D. Liquid argon time projection chambers will be key to one of the biggest upcoming particle physics experiments in the United States, the Deep Underground Neutrino Experiment in South Dakota. Because neutrinos very rarely interact with matter, the experiment demands such advanced detection techniques.</p>



<h4>Shining a light</h4>



<p>Scientists have also devised methods to detect particles via light. When a particle moves above a certain speed limit for a given material, it emits light, known as Cherenkov light. It’s analogous to an airplane passing the sound-speed barrier and creating a sonic boom. Charged particles can also emit light when passing through materials laced with certain chemicals, called scintillators.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" width="680" height="480" src="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/100-atoms_spotlight_tracks_liquid-scintillator_tracks_REV_2.jpg" alt="image of neutrino data from the NOvA experiment" class="wp-image-3101217" srcset="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/100-atoms_spotlight_tracks_liquid-scintillator_tracks_REV_2.jpg 680w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/100-atoms_spotlight_tracks_liquid-scintillator_tracks_REV_2-543x383.jpg 543w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/100-atoms_spotlight_tracks_liquid-scintillator_tracks_REV_2-638x450.jpg 638w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/100-atoms_spotlight_tracks_liquid-scintillator_tracks_REV_2-264x186.jpg 264w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><figcaption><span class="caption wp-caption-3101217">The NOvA experiment at Fermilab uses tubes of liquid scintillator to spot neutrinos interacting inside the detector.

<p>To spot the small amounts of light left behind by individual particles, scientists use photomultiplier tubes, originally invented in the 1930s, which convert light into electrical signals. These tubes could be used to pick up either Cherenkov light or scintillator light.</p>



<p>Scintillator detectors began to prove their worth in 1956 when a tank of liquid scintillator was used to discover the neutrino — once thought to be entirely undetectable. Liquid scintillator detectors are still common — used in the NOvA neutrino experiment at Fermilab, for example — as are detectors made of solid plastic strips with scintillator mixed in.</p>

<h4>Putting it all together</h4>



<p>Modern detectors at the world’s major particle colliders, like the detectors at the Large Hadron Collider at CERN near Geneva, throw in a bit of everything. “It’s this onion of different types of detectors; every layer is a different thing,” Raaf says. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" width="680" height="480" src="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/100-atoms_spotlight_tracks_modern_dectector.jpg" alt="image of a detector from the CMS experiment" class="wp-image-3101225" srcset="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/100-atoms_spotlight_tracks_modern_dectector.jpg 680w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/100-atoms_spotlight_tracks_modern_dectector-543x383.jpg 543w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/100-atoms_spotlight_tracks_modern_dectector-638x450.jpg 638w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/100-atoms_spotlight_tracks_modern_dectector-264x186.jpg 264w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><figcaption><span class="caption wp-caption-3101225">Modern detectors at particle colliders, such as the CMS experiment (shown) at CERN, pack in an assortment of technologies to spot the spray of particles from high-energy collisions.</span><span class="credit wp-credit-3101225">Maximilien Brice/CERN</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>Standing multiple stories tall, these massive machines include an assortment of technologies — plastic scintillator detectors, Cherenkov detectors, descendants of multiwire proportional chambers. They also typically include detectors made from silicon that can precisely measure particle tracks based on small electric currents produced when particle pass through. These detectors all work in concert within a very strong magnet. After particles collide at the center of the detector, computers crunch the data from all the parts and reconstruct what happened in the collision, tracing out the paths the particles took.</p>



<p>No matter the technique, the mesmerizing subatomic hieroglyphs allow physicists to decipher the native language of matter, unveiling its constituents and the forces by which they communicate. “It’s pretty amazing that you can see the invisible,” says Zeller.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/moon-lunar-magnetic-field-short-time-space">A lunar magnetic field may have lasted for only a short time</a></h4>

              
                <p>A lunar magnetic field may not have just been short-lived; it may have persisted for only a blip in geologic time, a new study finds.</p>



<p>Shortly after the moon formed about <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/moon-still-old">4.5 billion years ago</a>, it may have begun generating a magnetic field, a protective sheath that can deflect away charged particles from the sun (<em>SN: 1/11/17</em>). Now, analyses of moon rocks suggest that any lunar magnetic field was gone by <a href="https://advances.sciencemag.org/lookup/doi/10.1126/sciadv.abi7647">at least 4 billion years</a> ago, researchers report August 4 in <em>Science Advances</em>.</p>



<p>Magnetized lunar rocks brought back by Apollo astronauts decades ago were the first indication that <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/how-moon-got-its-magnetism">the moon may have once had an internal dynamo</a>, in which molten, iron-rich rock swirls inside the core of a celestial body, giving rise to a magnetic field (<em>SN: 11/9/11</em>). But how long such a lunar dynamo may have lasted has been unclear.</p>



<p>The moon’s core is “really small,” says John Tarduno, a geophysicist at the University of Rochester in New York, and it’s not clear how that core could have sustained a dynamo for long before cooling.</p>





<p>In the new study, Tarduno and colleagues examined the magnetization of a handful of Apollo rock samples. Analyzing the magnetism of tiny shards of metal trapped in crystals in rock dating to 3.9 billion, 3.6 billion, 3.3 billion and 3.2 billion years ago showed that those rocks were barely magnetized at all.</p>



<p>But the analyses also found that a piece of lunar glass formed during a meteorite impact about 2 million years ago “had a strong magnetic field — just a little weaker than Earth’s today,” Tarduno says. That’s odd, because “everyone agrees there isn’t a magnetic field on the moon now, and there wasn’t one 2 million years ago,” he says. “How does this happen?”</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" width="680" height="516" src="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/080421_CG_moon-magnet_inline-1.png" alt="piece of impact glass" class="wp-image-3102247" srcset="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/080421_CG_moon-magnet_inline-1.png 680w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/080421_CG_moon-magnet_inline-1-505x383.png 505w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/080421_CG_moon-magnet_inline-1-593x450.png 593w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/080421_CG_moon-magnet_inline-1-245x186.png 245w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><figcaption><span class="caption wp-caption-3102247">Researchers found strong magnetization in a bit of impact glass (similar to the glass shown) that formed during the collision of a meteorite with the lunar surface just 2 million years ago. That magnetization, the team suggests, came not from a magnetic field generated by the moon’s core, but from the force of the meteorite impact.</span><span class="credit wp-credit-3102247">Rory Cottrell</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>Taken together, these findings point to one conclusion, the team says: that the moon hasn’t generated a magnetic field for at least 4 billion years. The magnetization of the bit of glass happened due to the meteorite impact that also formed the glass itself, Tarduno and colleagues suggest.</p>



<p>That idea — that a meteorite impact can produce strong magnetization in rocks — is one that’s been discussed in many scientific studies in the past, Tarduno says. As the meteorite punches into the lunar surface at superfast speeds, that impact can partially ionize particles on the surface, creating a thick magnetized plasma. “The glass, as it was moving through this plasma, acquired that strong magnetization,” he says.</p>



<p>The moon <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/moon-map-lunar-surface-geology">has been repeatedly battered by meteorites</a> over time (<em>SN: 4/24/20</em>). And that means that other relatively young and highly magnetized lunar samples that researchers have puzzled over may have gotten their magnetization in this way, Tarduno says. If so, that may also help explain results from recent studies, based on analyses of the magnetization of a moon rock dating to between 2.5 billion and 1 billion years ago, that have suggested the moon’s magnetic field might have <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/moon-had-magnetic-field-least-billion-years-longer-thought">lingered until as recently as 1 billion years ago</a> (<em>SN: 8/9/17</em>).</p>





<p>Geodynamicists have wrangled over how the moon’s small core could have sustained a magnetic field for billions of years or even if the moon ever had a magnetic field at all, says Lisa Tauxe, a paleomagnetist at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography in La Jolla, Calif. Modeling studies of the moon’s core “just have a great deal of trouble generating enough oomph to make a magnetic field, whereas you can do that pretty easily for the Earth.” The new study, she says, “presents a well-argued case against a long-lived field.”</p>



<p>If any lunar magnetic field did disappear about 4 billion years ago, the lengthy bombardment of the moon&#8217;s surface by the solar wind since then may have left a hidden wealth of helium-3 and <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/meteor-showers-dig-water-moon-nasa">water</a> buried in the lunar soils (<em>SN: 4/15/19</em>). Those are products that future moon expeditions may be able to mine for energy as well as life support.</p>



<p>Drilling into those soils may also give scientists an unprecedented glimpse at the past physical properties of the sun, which could also help scientists better understand conditions on the early Earth, Tarduno says. “[We] have the potential now to learn both about the ancient sun and early Earth’s atmosphere, which you’re not going to get in any other way,” he adds. “That’s really exciting stuff.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/gravitational-wave-ligo-virgo-new-signals-ripples-spacetime">A bounty of potential gravitational wave events hints at exciting possibilities</a></h4>

              
                <p>A new crew of potential ripples in spacetime has just debuted — emphasis on the word “potential.”</p>



<p>By loosening the criteria for what qualifies as evidence for gravitational waves, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2108.01045">physicists identified 1,201 possible tremors</a>. Most are probably fakes, spurious jitters in the data that can mimic the cosmic vibrations, the team reports August 2 at arXiv.org. But by allowing in more false alarms, the new tally may also include some weak but genuine signals that would otherwise be missed, potentially revealing exciting new information about the sources of gravitational waves.</p>



<p>Scientists can now look for signs that may corroborate some of the uncertain detections, such as flashes of light in the sky that flared from the cosmic smashups that set off the ripples. Gravitational waves are typically spawned by <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/gravitational-waves-black-holes-spacetime-ligo-virgo">collisions of dense, massive objects, such as black holes or neutron stars</a>, the remnants of dead stars (<em>SN: 1/21/21</em>).</p>



<p>To come up with the new census, physicists reanalyzed six months of data from the Advanced Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory, or LIGO, and Virgo gravitational wave observatories. Scientists had already identified 39 of the events as likely gravitational waves in earlier analyses.</p>



<p>Eight events that hadn’t been previously identified stand a solid chance of being legitimate — with greater than a 50 percent probability of coming from an actual collision.</p>



<p>The physicists analyzed the data from those eight events to see how they might have occurred. In one, two black holes may have slammed together, melding into a whopper black hole with about 180 times the mass of the sun, which would make it <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/physics-gravitational-waves-midsize-black-hole-collision-ligo-virgo">the biggest black hole merger seen yet</a> (<em>SN: 9/2/20</em>). Another event could be a rare sighting of a <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/gravitational-waves-ligo-first-black-hole-neutron-star-merger">black hole swallowing a neutron star</a> (<em>SN: 6/29/21</em>).</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/spiders-eat-snakes-biology">Snake-eating spiders are surprisingly common</a></h4>

              
                <p>A spider’s typical dinner menu might include insects, worms or even <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/tiny-spider-uses-silk-lift-prey-50-times-its-own-weight-video">small lizards</a> and frogs (<em>SN: 2/3/21</em>). But some arachnids have more adventurous tastes — they can eat snakes up to 30 times their size.</p>



<p>Take the Australian redback. Not including legs, a female of this species of spider is only about the size of an M&amp;M candy. But she can take down relatively big prey such as juvenile eastern brown snakes, which are among the most venomous serpents in the world. A snake that gets trapped in a redback’s web — a messy tangle of long, sticky silk threads that dangle to the ground — is quickly set upon by the spider, which subdues the struggling victim with more sticky silk before delivering a toxic bite that eventually kills the snake.</p>



<p>“I find it cool that tiny Australian redback spiders can kill brown snakes,” says spider biologist Martin Nyffeler of the University of Basel in Switzerland. “[It’s] very fascinating and a little frightening!”</p>



<p>But redbacks are far from the only spiders with an appetite for snake. <a href="https://bioone.org/journals/the-journal-of-arachnology/volume-49/issue-1/JoA-S-20-050/Spiders-Arachnida-Araneae-feeding-on-snakes-Reptilia-Squamata/10.1636/JoA-S-20-050.full">At least 11 different families of spiders feed on snakes,</a> Nyffeler and herpetologist Whit Gibbons report May 11 in <em>The Journal of Arachnology.</em></p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" width="680" height="475" src="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/073021_aj_snake-eating-spiders_inline1_680.jpg" alt="Brown widow spider crawls along a scarlet snake ensnared in the spider's web" class="wp-image-3102098" srcset="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/073021_aj_snake-eating-spiders_inline1_680.jpg 680w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/073021_aj_snake-eating-spiders_inline1_680-548x383.jpg 548w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/073021_aj_snake-eating-spiders_inline1_680-644x450.jpg 644w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/073021_aj_snake-eating-spiders_inline1_680-266x186.jpg 266w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><figcaption><span class="caption wp-caption-3102098">In Georgia, this brown widow spider (<em>Latrodectus</em> <em>geometricus</em>) snared a scarlet snake (<em>Cemophora coccinea</em>).</span><span class="credit wp-credit-3102098">Daniel R. Crook</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>Nyffeler and Gibbons, of the University of Georgia in Athens, searched for reports of snake-eating spiders in all sorts of places — from research journals and magazine articles to social media and YouTube videos. In all, the team analyzed 319 accounts from all over the world. Most reports came from Australia and the United States, but these spiders live on every continent except Antarctica.</p>



<p>“I didn’t realize how common this was. I don’t think anybody did,” says evolutionary biologist Mercedes Burns of the University of Maryland, Baltimore County, who was not involved in the research.<br><br>Snakes that the spiders ate came from seven families. Some, including coral snakes, rattlers, palm-pitvipers and lanceheads, are highly venomous. “I was kind of surprised at the types of snakes that were described because some of them are pretty big, pretty strong,” Burns says.</p>





<p>Tangle web spiders, a group that includes North American widow spiders and redbacks, are the most successful snake slayers, Nyffeler and Gibbons found. Relatively small, these spiders can catch snakes 10 to 30 times their size, Nyffeler says.</p>



<p>Tidier <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/spiders-poisonous-webs-neuro-toxins-genes">orb weaver spiders</a> don’t do too shabbily either (<em>SN: 8/3/20</em>). A golden silk orb weaver in Florida caught a 1-meter-long green snake, the longest in the study. However, making a meal of green snakes may be a risky choice — these serpents often eat arachnids, including orb weaver spiders, the researchers say.</p>



<p>Not all snake-eating spiders trap the serpents with webs. <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/spider-tarantula-eating-weird-stuff-complex-amazon-food-webs">Tarantulas actively hunt their prey</a>, then use powerful jaws to deliver a potent venom (<em>SN: 2/28/19</em>). “Often a tarantula tries to catch the snake by the head and will hold on in spite of all efforts of the snake to shake him off,” Nyffeler says. Once that venom takes effect, the snake calms down.</p>



<p>In some encounters, venom defeated snakes in minutes. In others, spiders took days to kill their prey, Nyffeler and Gibbons found.</p>

<p>Once the snakes die, spiders use enzymes to turn soft body parts into a soup that the arachnids suck into their stomach. “They have what’s called a pumping stomach,” Burns says. “It’s almost like their stomach is attached to a rubbery straw. They have to kind of suck everything down.”</p>



<p>Most of spiders in the study likely dine on snake only now and again, Nyffeler says. Some South American tarantulas, however, eat snakes and frogs almost exclusively.</p>



<p>Nyffeler hopes that his new study increases appreciation for spiders, which he calls extraordinary creatures. “The fact that small spiders are capable of killing much larger snakes is very fascinating,” he says. “Knowing and understanding this enriches our understanding of how nature works.”</p>

                <p><em>By</em> <a href="https://twitter.com/mattbwarren">Matthew Warren</a></p>



<p>Many of the world’s most pressing problems require global co-operation. If we are to combat climate change or contain the spread of devastating diseases, for instance, we need to work across borders and share resources.</p>



<p>So a <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-021-24787-1">new study</a> in <em>Nature Communications </em>doesn’t make for encouraging reading. Using a common paradigm for studying co-operation, Angelo Romano from the Max Planck Institute for Research on Collective Goods and colleagues look at how more than 18,000 participants from 42 different countries co-operate with people from their own nation and elsewhere. They find that in every single country, participants show national parochialism: they co-operate more readily with people from their own country than with others.</p>



<span id="more-43134"></span>



<p>Participants completed 12 trials of a prisoner’s dilemma task, each with a different partner who either came from their own country or another country (there were also some trials in which participants weren’t given any information about their partner’s nationality). In each trial, participants were given 10 “monetary units”, and had to decide how many to keep for themselves and how many to give to their partner. Any money they gave away was doubled — and any they received from their partner were doubled too — so in theory the optimal result would be for both parties to co-operate by giving away all of their money. Additionally, on some trials participants were told their decisions would be private, while on others they were told they would be published online.</p>



<p>The team found that people co-operated more (i.e. sent more money to their partner) when their partner came from the same country compared to when they came from a different country. This effect was statistically significant for 39 of the 42 countries, and the remaining three showed a non-significant trend in the same direction. It also didn’t matter whether or not their decisions were going to be made public: participants displayed this “national parochialism” either way. And although the decisions were all about a hypothetical pool of money, a sub-study in which participants actually received a monetary reward produced the same results.</p>



<p>Interestingly, the extent to which participants favoured co-operating with their compatriots over people from other nations was similar across the different countries, and the team didn’t find any evidence that this was related to cultural or political factors. By contrast, they did find that <em>overall</em> levels of co-operation varied by country and were related to particular factors. For instance, co-operation was generally greater in countries with more egalitarian values and those where there are more opportunities to establish new relationships with others.</p>



<p>The results suggest that national parochialism occurs around the world with surprisingly little variation. This is consistent with theories that our tendency to favour the in-group is a universal human behaviour, the authors write. However, they also note that past studies using different methodologies<em> have </em>found cultural differences in in-group favouritism, so further work is needed to understand the exact scenarios in which national parochialism emerges in different countries.</p>



<p>Still, the study shows that at least when it comes to making decisions about sharing goods with others, people are less keen to co-operate with those outside of their own country. While the paper focuses on decisions made at an individual level rather than those made by governments and institutions, the work has clear implications when it comes to understanding the obstacles to co-operating across borders. In fact, we’re in the middle of a pandemic that requires a co-ordinated, global response, yet in most low-income countries <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-021-02109-1">the vast majority of people haven’t received a single dose</a>.

<p><a href="https://bookshop.org/a/21798/9781643135748">How the Mountains Grew</a><br><em>John Dvorak</em><br><em>Pegasus Books, $29.95</em></p>



<p>Imagine a world where pigeon-sized dragonflies soar above spiders with half-meter-long legs, where 2-meter-long millipedes slither and 20-kilogram scorpions hunt. About 300 million years ago, such surreal creatures thrived; today, rocks hint at how these and other creatures in the deep past lived. These clues allow geologist and writer John Dvorak to vividly re-create ancient landscapes in <em>How the Mountains Grew: A New Geological History of North America</em>.</p>



<p>Far from a dusty tome plodding through plate tectonics, the book teems with life as Dvorak establishes inextricable links between geology and biology. Take the oversize dragonflies and millipedes now preserved as fossils. Rocks of a similar age hold evidence of a rise in atmospheric oxygen that helps explain how these animals grew so large.</p>





<p>The book zigzags from place to place on a chronological, continental-scale field trip. To avoid dizzying readers, Dvorak revisits certain sites that preserve multiple threads of geologic history. For instance, at Mount Rushmore in South Dakota’s Black Hills, he describes how, about 2 billion years ago, molten rock rose and lodged itself into sedimentary rocks deposited on the seafloor of bygone oceans. Today, presidents’ faces stare out from this now-solidified magma, those ancient oceanic sediments sitting just below the visage of George Washington. The book later returns to glimpse younger seas that came and went, depositing sediments now replete with fossils. All these rocks, Dvorak explains, whisper stories of how this particular mountain grew.</p>





<p>Dvorak also ponders Earth’s future, envisioning an ice sheet grinding down Mount Rushmore’s carefully carved profiles more than 100,000 years from now. And he considers humankind’s future, arguing that we must determine how our dependence on fossil fuels — the result of another interplay between biology and geology — will end.</p>



<p>But it’s a different end, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/chicxulub-collision-earth-crust-hot-water-microbes-million-years">the asteroid impact that marked the demise of the nonbird dinosaurs</a> (<em>SN: 6/1/20</em>), where Dvorak’s storytelling shines brightest. He imagines the final days of the last <em>Tyrannosaurus rex</em>, describing its desperate search for food somewhere well north of Mount Rushmore. In the hours to months after the impact, we share this behemoth’s last steps, its final gasps.</p>



<p>“No degree of evolutionary perfection could have guaranteed survival,” Dvorak writes. As that lone <em>T. re</em>x dies on the page, we can’t help but realize that we, too, are brief biological moments in geologic time.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/black-hole-magnetic-field-hair-computer-simulations-physics">Black holes born with magnetic fields quickly shed them</a></h4>

              
                <p>Like a shaggy dog in springtime, some black holes have to shed. New computer simulations reveal how black holes might discard their magnetic fields.</p>



<p>Unlike dogs with their varied fur coats, isolated black holes are mostly identical. They are characterized by only their mass, spin and electric charge. According to a rule known as the no-hair theorem, any other distinguishing characteristics, or “hair,” are quickly cast off. That includes magnetic fields.</p>



<p>The rule applies to black holes in a vacuum, where magnetic fields can simply slip away. But, says astrophysicist Ashley Bransgrove of Columbia University, “what we were thinking about is what happens in a more realistic scenario.” A magnetized black hole would typically be surrounded by electrically charged matter called plasma, and scientists didn’t know how — or even if — such black holes would undergo hair loss.</p>



<p>Black holes can be born with magnetic fields or gain them later, for example by <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/gravitational-waves-ligo-first-black-hole-neutron-star-merger">swallowing a neutron star</a>, a highly magnetic dead star (<em>SN: 6/29/21</em>). When Bransgrove and colleagues simulated the plasma surrounding a magnetized black hole, they found that a process called magnetic reconnection allows the magnetic field to escape the black hole. The magnetic field lines that map out the field’s direction break apart and reconnect. Loops of magnetic field form around blobs of plasma, some of which <a href="https://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.127.055101">blast outward</a>, while others fall into the black hole. That process eliminates the black hole’s magnetic field, the researchers report in the July 30 <em>Physical Review Letters</em>.</p>



<p>Magnetic reconnection in balding black holes could spew X-rays that astronomers could detect. So scientists may one day glimpse a black hole losing its hair.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/greece-santorini-volcano-eruption-sea-level">Greece’s Santorini volcano erupts more often when sea level drops</a></h4>

              
                <p>When sea level drops far below the present-day level, the island volcano Santorini in Greece gets ready to rumble.</p>



<p>A comparison of the activity of the volcano, which is now partially collapsed, with sea levels over the last 360,000 years reveals that when the sea level dips more than 40 meters below the present-day level, it triggers a fit of eruptions. During times of higher sea level, <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41561-021-00783-4">the volcano is quiet</a>, researchers report online August 2 in <em>Nature Geoscience</em>.</p>



<p>Other volcanoes around the globe are probably similarly influenced by sea levels, the researchers say. Most of the world’s volcanic systems are in or near oceans.</p>



<p>“It’s hard to see why a coastal or island volcano would not be affected by sea level,” says Iain Stewart, a geoscientist at the Royal Scientific Society of Jordan in Amman, who was not involved in the work. Accounting for these effects could make volcano hazard forecasting more accurate.</p>





<p>Santorini consists of a ring of islands surrounding the central tip of a volcano poking out of the Aegean Sea. The entire volcano used to be above water, but a violent eruption around 1600 B.C. caused the volcano to cave in partially, forming a lagoon. That <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/big-volcanoes-wake-fast">particular eruption</a> is famous for potentially dooming the Minoan civilization and inspiring the legend of the lost city of Atlantis (<em>SN: 2/1/12</em>).</p>



<p>To investigate how sea level might influence the volcano, researchers created a computer simulation of Santorini’s magma chamber, which sits about four kilometers beneath the surface of the volcano. In the simulation, when the sea level dropped at least 40 meters below the present-day level, the crust above the magma chamber splintered. “That gives an opportunity for the magma that’s stored under the volcano to move up through these fractures and make its way to the surface,” says study coauthor Christopher Satow, a physical geographer at Oxford Brookes University in England.</p>



<p>According to the simulation, it should take about 13,000 years for those cracks to reach the surface and awaken the volcano. After the water rises again, it should take about 11,000 years for the cracks to close and eruptions to stop.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" width="680" height="383" src="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/073021_mt_santorini_inline_680.gif" alt="animation of sea level rise, cracking crust and a volcanic eruption" class="wp-image-3102078" /><figcaption><span class="caption wp-caption-3102078">When the sea drops at least 40 meters below the present-day level, the crust beneath the Santorini volcano (illustrated) starts to crack. As the sea level drops even further over thousands of years, those cracks spread to the surface, bringing up magma that feeds volcanic eruptions.</span><span class="credit wp-credit-3102078">Oxford Brookes University</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>It may seem counterintuitive that lowering the amount of water atop the magma chamber would cause the crust to splinter. Satow compares the scenario to wrapping your hands around an inflated balloon, where the rubber is Earth’s crust and your hands’ inward pressure is the weight of the ocean. As someone else pumps air into the balloon — like magma building up under Earth’s crust — the pressure of your hands helps prevent the balloon from popping. “As soon as you start to release the pressure with your hands, [like] taking the sea level down, the balloon starts to expand,” Satow says, and ultimately the balloon breaks.</p>



<p>Satow’s team tested the predictions of the simulation by comparing the Santorini volcano’s eruption history — preserved in the rock layers of the islands surrounding the central volcano tip — with evidence of past sea levels from marine sediments. All but three of the volcano’s 211 well-dated eruptions in the last 360,000 years happened during periods of low sea level, as the simulation predicted. Such periods of low sea level occurred when more of Earth’s water was locked up in glaciers during ice ages.</p>



<p>“It’s really intriguing and interesting, and perhaps not surprising, given that other studies have shown that volcanoes are sensitive to changes in their stress state,” says Emilie Hooft, a geophysicist at the University of Oregon in Eugene, who wasn’t involved in the work. Volcanoes in Iceland, for instance, have shown an uptick in eruptions after overlying glaciers have melted, relieving the volcanic systems of the weight of the ice.</p>



<p>Volcanoes around the world are likely subject to the effects of sea level, Satow says, though how much probably varies. “Some will be very sensitive to sea level changes, and for others there will be almost no impact at all.” These effects will depend on the depth of the magma chambers feeding into each volcano and the properties of the surrounding crust.</p>



<p>But if sea level controls the activity of any volcano in or near the ocean, at least to an extent, “you’d expect all these volcanoes to be in sync with one another,” Satow says, “which would be incredible.”</p>



<p>As for Santorini, given that the last time sea level was 40 meters below the present-day level was about 11,000 years ago — and sea level is continuing to rise due to climate change — Satow’s team expects the volcano to enter <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/greek-volcano-reawakens">a period of relative quiet</a> right about now (<em>SN: 3/14/12</em>). But two major eruptions in the volcano’s history did happen amid high sea levels, the researchers say, so future violent eruptions aren’t completely off the table.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/hammerhead-shark-baby-florida-historic-nursery-endangered">A hammerhead shark baby boom near Florida hints at a historic nursery</a></h4>

              
                <p>It seems like an unlikely place for a nursery of endangered hammerhead sharks, but a recreational hot spot just off the coast of Miami may host a school of these precious babies. If confirmed, the nursery would be the first ever identified in U.S. Atlantic waters for this iconic shark species.</p>



<p>Finding an endangered shark nursery in a vast ocean is like finding a needle in a haystack. While scientists have used satellites to track migrations of adult great hammerheads (<em>Sphyrna mokarran</em>), where the sharks breed and give birth and where babies grow up is still “a bit of a mystery,” says shark scientist Catherine Macdonald of the University of Miami.</p>



<p>Macdonald investigates where and how sharks can thrive in areas that are heavily impacted by humans. One of those areas is Florida’s Biscayne Bay, a popular spot for fishing and boating that is polluted by urban runoff. There, she and colleagues regularly survey shark abundance and diversity using a catch-and-release system: Sharks that get hooked on baited lines are reeled in, documented, tagged and put back into the water.</p>



<p>Discovering a potential hammerhead shark nursery was an accident. The team got its first inkling of something special in June 2018, when researchers caught a juvenile great hammerhead — an interesting anomaly. In a decade of surveying, the team had never captured a hammerhead in these waters, says David Shiffman, a marine biologist at Arizona State University who is based in Washington, D.C. Several months later, the team caught another young hammerhead.</p>



<p>Over the next year and a half, “we kept catching them … every few months,” Macdonald says. So far, the team has documented <a href="https://conbio.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/csp2.418">nine baby great hammerheads</a>, Macdonald, Shiffman and colleagues report July 11 in <em>Conservation Science and Practice</em>. Based on the sharks’ sizes — all under 200 centimeters long — they were less than 5 years old. The area where the young sharks have been found is fairly shallow and carpeted with seagrass, which probably provides protection and is rife with small fish to eat, the researchers suspect.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" width="680" height="410" src="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/072921_sharl-nursery_inline-1.jpg" alt="researchers measuring a baby hammerhead shark on top of a cooler" class="wp-image-3102062" srcset="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/072921_sharl-nursery_inline-1.jpg 680w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/072921_sharl-nursery_inline-1-635x383.jpg 635w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/072921_sharl-nursery_inline-1-308x186.jpg 308w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><figcaption><span class="caption wp-caption-3102062">Researchers on a boat in Florida’s Biscayne Bay measure a live juvenile great hammerhead shark before releasing it back into the water.</span><span class="credit wp-credit-3102062">Field School</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>Though the Biscayne Bay site seems to be experiencing a hammerhead shark baby boom, officially designating the area as a nursery will require more monitoring. Juvenile sharks are more common at the site than other areas surveyed and the sharks come back to it for multiple years, the team says. But it’s unknown whether the sharks reside at the site for extended periods of weeks or months — the third and final <a href="https://www.int-res.com/articles/meps2007/337/m337p287.pdf">criteria</a> for the site to qualify as a nursery.</p>



<p>Great hammerhead sharks breed infrequently, about once every two years. And the rate at which people catch and kill the sharks — both accidentally and <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/poached-hammerhead-fins-traced-endangered-populations">intentionally</a> (<em>SN: 12/1/09</em>) — contributed to the International Union for the Conservation of Nature listing the species as critically endangered in 2019. So when nursery areas are discovered, “it’s important they remain safe,” says marine biologist Jasmin Graham, President and CEO of Minorities in Shark Sciences, an organization that promotes diversity and inclusion in marine science. And while adult sharks have few predators other than people, “there’s a super high mortality rate for juveniles.” With an already unstable population, as many juveniles as possible that can survive to reproductive age is crucial, Graham says.</p>



<p>The possibility of an endangered shark nursery in Biscayne Bay fills Macdonald with hope, and she is working with conservation partners to get legal <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/blog/wild-things/why-we-need-predators">protections</a> for this important site (<em>SN: 9/17/15</em>). “Even in such a heavily impacted place, it is possible for nature to be thriving,” she says.</p>

                <p><em>By </em><a href="http://emilyoliviareynolds.com/">Emily Reynolds</a></p>



<p>For many readers, the idea of interacting with an overtly sexist person probably doesn’t sound particularly appealing — yet in many instances we <em>do</em> continue to engage with those who espouse sexist views. A <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/00224545.2020.1819187">new study</a>, authored by Elena Agadullina from Russia’s National Research University Higher School of Economics, finds one factor that could determine whether we are likely to want to interact with a perpetrator of sexism: their intelligence. Participants preferred to interact with intelligent people — even those who had engaged in sexist behaviour.</p>



<span id="more-43091"></span>



<p>Participants, 348 Russian students, were sorted into three conditions. All read descriptions of a man named Peter; in one condition, Peter was described as having an IQ of 130; in another, Peter had a below average IQ of 100; and in the control condition participants received no information about his intelligence.</p>



<p>They were then separated into further conditions. In the sexist condition, Peter was described as someone who believes that women are not as intelligent as men, and that they should therefore work only on household chores, while participants in the non-sexist condition read that Peter believed women should have equal rights and opportunities. Finally, participants indicated how willing they would be to develop a relationship with Peter, be friends with him, or interact with him in everyday life (these were combined into a single measure of willingness to interact with Peter in the future).</p>



<p>Perceived intelligence played a significant role in participants’ choices about interactions. Overall, participants would rather interact with a non-sexist person than a sexist one. But intelligence mattered: they were more willing to interact with a sexist person when they read that he was intelligent than when they read he wasn’t. In fact, participants’ responses showed that they would rather engage with an intelligent sexist over an unintelligent <em>non-sexist</em>. This was the case for both men and women.</p>



<p>The second study looked at different manifestations of sexism. Participants read a story about either Peter or a woman named Sofia, who were described as either highly intelligent or unintelligent. They then either heard that Peter/Sofia had forced a young colleague into a sexual relationship or had innocently invited a colleague to a café to discuss work, before answering the same questions about interactions as in the first study.</p>



<p>This time, participants also completed a measure of their own sexism, indicating how much they agreed with six statements related to hostile sexism (such as “women seek to gain power by gaining control over men”) and benevolent sexism (“women should be cherished and protected by men”).</p>



<p>Again, participants preferred to interact with an intelligent harasser than a non-intelligent one. Interestingly, participants in the no sexual harassment condition were no more or less likely to want to engage with an intelligent than an unintelligent person.</p>



<p>Participants with high levels of hostile sexist attitudes themselves, on the other hand, were more likely to want to interact with an unintelligent woman, and in particular with an unintelligent woman harasser. This may be because the unintelligent woman character fit neatly within their worldview rather than challenging the status quo in any way.</p>



<p>One of Agadullina’s suggestions as to why participants preferred intelligent sexists is that people see sexism as a more malleable characteristic than intelligence: they may therefore make calculations about whether or not to interact with a sexist person on those grounds, believing they have the potential to change. Future research could look more closely at why knowing that an individual is intelligent overrides our better judgement about sexual harassment and sexism, as well as what other traits may also act as mitigating factors. Replicating the work in different cultural settings could also prove interesting.</p>



<p>Although the research focused on individual interactions, writing off sexism due to someone&#8217;s perceived intelligence has a wider impact: it can send the message that sexist behaviour is not particularly important if the perpetrator has other desirable characteristics. Continuing social and political work that highlights the importance of justice and equity for everyone remains key.</p>

<p>The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic has been felt in all areas of human life, from the impact on healthcare and the economy to education and the movement of people. The pandemic has also affected many sporting events, including the Olympic and Paralympic Games in Tokyo which was due to be hosted in 2020 but was postponed to 2021. With regional and national lockdowns and stay-at homes orders, training schedules for athletes have also been disrupted. To better understand the impacts on athletes with disabilities Piotr Urbański from Poznan University of Physical Education, Poland and colleagues decided to survey 166 athletes who were members of either the Polish Paralympic Committee or the Polish Sports Association for the Disabled’Start. The study found that the athletes were strongly affected by the pandemic and whilst a majority reported training at home, 12% stopped training altogether. Across the group the athletes reduced their training from 9.4h/week to 5.3h/week, highlighting the impact the pandemic has had on these athletes many of whom will be hoping to compete in the Paralympic games in August and September this year.</p>
<h4>Plasma-rich platelet products could help treat bilateral hip osteoarthritis in dogs &#8211; <em><a href="https://bmcvetres.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12917-021-02913-x">BMC Veterinary Research</a></em></h4>

<p>Osteoarthritis (OA) is a common disease affecting companion animals. In dogs, OA commonly affects the hip joint leading the reduced function and pain for the animals. There are limited treatment options available with most treatment focused on alleviating pain and improving joint function rather than treating the disease. Recently there has been interest in using of platelet-rich plasma (PRP) to treat musculoskeletal disorders such as OA. Alves from the University of Evora, Portugal and colleagues from the Portuguese National Guard set out to test the use of PRP to treat police working dogs with bilateral hip OA.  After intra-articular administration of the PRP the team used a variety of scales including the Canine Brief Pain and Canine Orthopedic Indices to measure response to treatment. Compared to a control group receiving a saline treatment, the dogs treated with PRP saw improvements in pain and functional scores and no additional medication was required during the study’s follow-up period. The team concluded that PRP product could be a good therapeutic option for Hip OA in dogs.</p>
<h4>Mutant p53 affects chromatin accessibility in tumor cells through direct and indirect mechanisms &#8211; <em><a href="https://bmccancer.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12885-021-08362-x">BMC Cancer</a></em></h4>

<p>The transcription factor, p53 encoded by the TP53 is a well characterized tumor suppressor and mutations in the gene sequence can affect its tumor suppressor activity. Some mutations can also result in a gain-of-function oncogenic activity. The effects of mutations on p53 binding to the genome has been well documented, but changes to chromatin accessibility has not been previously characterized. In their study, Bhavya Dhaka and Radhakrishnan Sabarinathan from National Centre for Biological Sciences, India use chromatin accessibility data from the The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) to identify regions in the genome where chromatin accessibility is altered in tumors with mutant p53. The pair identified 1587 and 984 areas where chromatin accessibility was lost and gained, respectively, in breast cancer and 1143 lost and 640 gained in colon cancer. Surprisingly, less than half the sites identified contained sequence motifs for p53 binding. However, these are regions associated with other transcriptional regulators, suggesting that gain-of-function p53 mutants utilizes both direct and indirect mechanisms to affect chromatin accessibility.</p>
<h4>USA National representative survey provides insight into factors affecting inequalities in accessing affordable, healthy food &#8211; <em><a href="https://bmcnutr.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s40795-021-00434-2">BMC Nutrition</a></em></h4>

<p>In recent years, inequalities in accessing high-quality and affordable food within the United States have been identified. This is primarily due the existence of food deserts – geographical regions where it is difficult to buy affordable, high-quality food –  within minority neighborhood. Much of the research to date has focused on assessing access and food-quality by using directories, census data and/or Geographic Information Systems. In their study Sansom and Hannibal from Texas A&amp;M School of Public Health, USA conducted a nationally representative survey to better understand the motivations and efforts that minority groups encounter to reach stores providing healthy food options. Their survey of 1612 participants found that saving money, having a good selection of food including organic foods were important factors for minority populations when choosing where to purchase food. In addition, driving less was a major consideration however, the survey demonstrated that minority groups across the USA need to drive for significantly longer their white counterparts to reach stores. The study from Sansom and Hannibal highlights the variety of issues that need to be tackled to reduce inequalities.</p>
<h4>Inexpensive 3D printing mask frames can prolong the life of N95 and KN95 masks &#8211; <em><a href="https://bmcbiomedeng.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s42490-021-00055-7"><span class="c-journal-title__text ">BMC Biomedical Engineering</span></a></em></h4>

<p>The COVID-19 pandemic has caused supply shortages of various forms of personal protective equipment, including N95 and KN95 respirators used by healthcare professionals. This has led to masks being used for prolonged periods of time and in some cases being reused after decontamination procedures. However, the reusability of these masks is hampered by degradation of the fit of the masks. To try to improve the reusability, Malia McAvoy from Harvard Medical School, USA and colleagues set out to develop a mask frame for damaged and/or poor fitting masks. Using inexpensive 3D printing, the team developed a mask frame consisting of two printed side pieces connected by malleable wired links that allowed the user to mould the frame and mask against their face to recreate the tight fit. The frame is then held in place by elastic around the head. The team tested the fit on 45 volunteers with and without the mask frames on four different brands of either N95 or KN95 standard. For volunteers using masks with broken and effective straps an average of 85% passed the fit test, suggesting that the mask frames can prolong the lifespan of the masks.</p>
