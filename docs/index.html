As Retraction Watch readers know, reporting on the same data more than once — without notifying editors and readers — is bad for the scientific record and can lead to a retraction. Apparently, in the rush to publish findings about the coronavirus pandemic, some researchers are doing just that.

<p><a href="https://arxiv.org/">arXiv</a>, the world’s leading source of open access scientific research, is pleased to welcome Dr. Eleonora Presani as its first executive director.</p>
<p>Dr. Presani earned her PhD in astroparticle physics at the University of Amsterdam and then completed her postdoc at CERN, where she worked remotely on the International Space Station’s AMS02 instrument. After that, she was publisher at Elsevier for high energy physics journals, and her projects included SCOAP3, SoftwareX, and Physics of the Dark Universe. In the last four years her career shifted to digital product development, working as Product Manager in Scopus.</p>
<p>As executive director, Dr. Presani now leads arXiv’s operations, as well as technical and business planning, governance, and fundraising efforts. Based in New York City, she oversees a growing staff distributed across Cornell University’s Ithaca campus, Cornell Tech in NYC, and other locations. She also coordinates a global network of volunteer advisory board members and moderators.</p>
<p>“I am honored and thrilled to take the helm of arXiv, a groundbreaking service with incredible potential for technological growth and innovative development,” Dr. Presani says. “arXiv was a ‘disrupter’ of traditional academic publishing before the world wide web became popular, and it continues to be a central point of global scientific knowledge sharing. I have been a user of arXiv since my undergraduate study in physics, and it was such an important source of information to me throughout my academic career, as it has been and continues to be for millions of researchers around the world. I look forward to engaging with the scientific and member advisory boards, as well as the larger, global community, to take us to the next level, and make this knowledge more accessible to everyone who wants it.”</p>
<p>Dr. Presani is passionate about bringing the art and complexities of technology to a wider audience, using accessible and creative methods. She also enjoys bridging together systems and people.</p>
<p>“We are very fortunate to have someone of Eleonora’s experience and background joining the arXiv team,” says Carol Hoover, member of arXiv’s Member Advisory Board (MAB) and Digital Information Resources Manager at Los Alamos National Laboratory Research Library. “She is a strong communicator with deep technical capabilities and has a solid understanding of arXiv’s purpose and mission.”</p>
<p>Dr. Licia Verde, chair of arXiv’s Scientific Advisory Board (SAB) and ICREA Professor, says, “We are proud that we can count on Eleonora, her skills, talents and expertise in scientific dissemination and the publishing ecosystem.”</p>
<p>arXiv was founded in 1991 by physicist Paul Ginsparg and is a groundbreaking invention that popularized free, open-access scholarly research. Today, it continues to allow researchers from around the world to share scientific findings quickly, in fields ranging from astrophysics to economics. More than 180 moderators shepherd scholarly articles through the submission process, and more than 230 institutional members contribute financial support, in addition to the Simons Foundation, Cornell University, and other funders. arXiv has grown exponentially in the past decade, with more than 1.6 million submissions and more than a billion downloads in its 29-year history.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/619898700/0/oupblogpsychology/">Seven books on the fascinating human brain [reading list]</a></h4>

<p>The human brain is often described as the <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-18233409">most complex object in the known universe</a> – we know so much, and yet so little, about the way it works. It’s no wonder then that the study of brain today encompasses an enormous range of topics, from abstract understanding of consciousness to microscopic exploration of billions of neurons. Brain Awareness Week takes place this year March 16-22. To mark the occasion, we’ve put together a list of books that explore the matter between your ears.</p><ol><li><em> <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://global.oup.com/academic/product/birth-of-intelligence-9780190908324">Birth of Intelligence</a></em> <strong>Daeyeol Lee </strong><br />What is intelligence? Does a high level of biological intelligence require a complex brain? Can man-made machines be truly intelligent? In <em>Birth of Intelligence</em>, distinguished neuroscientist Daeyeol Lee tackles pressing issues that will be key to preparing for future society and its technology, including how the use of AI will impact our lives.</li><li><em><a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://global.oup.com/academic/product/how-not-to-train-the-brain-9780198789673">How (not) to train the brain</a></em><em> </em><strong>Amir Raz and Sheida Rabipour <img height="220" src="https://blog.oup.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/ENihhJkDjS0-143x220.jpg" width="143" /></strong><br />Can we improve cognitive performance through deliberate training? The short answer is yes, albeit with some caveats. In this book, the authors review data from hundreds of articles and provide an overarching account of the field, separating scientific evidence from publicity myth and guiding readers through how they should – and should not – train the brain.</li><li><em><a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://global.oup.com/academic/product/the-evolutionary-road-to-human-memory-9780198828051">The Evolutionary Road to Human Memory</a></em> <strong>Elisabeth A. Murray, Steven P. Wise, Mary K. L. Baldwin, and Kim S. Graham </strong><br />This book tells an intriguing story about how evolution shaped human memory. As our ancestors faced the problems and opportunities of their time, their brains developed new forms of memory that helped them gain an advantage in life. Sometime during human evolution, another new kind of memory emerged that ignited the human imagination, and empowered every individual, day upon day, to add new pages to the story of a life.</li><li><em><a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://global.oup.com/academic/product/musical-illusions-and-phantom-words-9780190206833">Musical Illusions and Phantom Words</a></em> <strong>Diana Deutsch <img height="220" src="https://blog.oup.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/EF4XXCFsD6Q-145x220.png" width="145" /> </strong><br />Why is perfect pitch so rare? Why do some people hallucinate music or speech? In this ground-breaking synthesis of art and science, Diana Deutsch, one of the world’s leading experts on the psychology of music, shows how illusions of music and speech—many of which she herself discovered—have fundamentally altered thinking about the brain.</li><li><em><a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://global.oup.com/academic/product/sex-lies-and-brain-scans-9780198752882">Sex, Lies, and Brain Scans</a></em><em> </em><strong>Barbara J. Sahakian and Julia Gottwald </strong><em><br />Sex, Lies, and Brain Scans</em> takes readers beyond the media headlines. The authors consider what the technique of fMRI entails, and important ethical questions these techniques raise. Should individuals applying for jobs be screened for unconscious racial bias? How far will we allow neuroscience to go? It is time to make up our minds.</li><li><em><a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://global.oup.com/academic/product/the-elephant-in-the-brain-9780190495992">The Elephant in the Brain</a></em> <strong>Kevin Simler and Robin Hanson <img height="220" src="https://blog.oup.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/EOGhBuYI0KI-145x220.jpg" width="145" /></strong><br />Our brains are designed not just to hunt and gather, but also to help us get ahead socially, often via deception and self-deception. But while we may be self-interested schemers, we benefit by pretending otherwise. The less we know about our own ugly motives, the better – and thus we don’t like to talk or even think about the extent of our selfishness. This is “the elephant in the brain.”</li><li><em><a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://global.oup.com/academic/product/your-brain-on-food-9780190932794">Your Brain on Food, Third Edition</a></em> <strong>Gary L. Wenk </strong><br />This essential book vividly demonstrates how a little knowledge about the foods and drugs we eat can teach us a lot about how our brain functions. The intersection between brain science, drugs, food and our cultural and religious traditions is plainly illustrated in an entirely new light. Wenk tackles fundamental and fascinating questions, such as: <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://medium.com/@OUPAcademic/feed-an-injured-brain-fad1cb8b729d">Are some foods better to eat after brain injury</a>?</li></ol><p>These books showcase some fascinating areas of brain research. But we’ve still got a long way to go before most of our questions about this intricate organ are answered. A comprehensive understanding of the brain is especially critical to combating public health issues, including rising rates of dementia and psychiatric disorders. As such, the continuing progress of brain research will be beneficial to us all.</p><p><em>Featured Image Credit: Owned by Oxford University Press.</em></p><p>The post <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://blog.oup.com/2020/03/seven-books-on-the-fascinating-human-brain-reading-list/">Seven books on the fascinating human brain [reading list]</a> appeared first on <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://blog.oup.com">OUPblog</a>.</p><img align="left" border="0" height="1" hspace="0" src="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/i/619898700/0/oupblogpsychology" style="border: 0; float: left; margin: 0; padding: 0; width: 1px!important; height: 1px!important;" width="1" /><div style="clear: both; padding-top: 0.2em;"><a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/2/619898700/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/fbshare20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/28/619898700/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/fblike20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/30/619898700/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/googleplus20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/16/619898700/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/linkedin20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/29/619898700/oupblogpsychology,https%3a%2f%2fblog.oup.com%2fwp-content%2fuploads%2f2020%2f03%2fENihhJkDjS0-143x220.jpg"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/pinterest20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/1/619898700/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/reddit20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/24/619898700/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/twitter20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/19/619898700/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/email20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/20/619898700/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/rss20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a><h3 style="clear: left; padding-top: 10px;">Related Stories</h3><ul><li><a href="https://blog.oup.com/2020/03/how-air-pollution-may-lead-to-alzheimers-disease/" rel="nofollow">How air pollution may lead to Alzheimer’s disease</a></li><li><a href="https://blog.oup.com/2020/03/lessons-for-the-coronavirus-from-the-1899-honolulu-plague/" rel="nofollow">Lessons for the coronavirus from the 1899 Honolulu plague</a></li><li><a href="https://blog.oup.com/2020/03/learning-microbiology-through-comics/" rel="nofollow">Learning microbiology through comics</a></li></ul> </div>

<p><em>By </em><a href="http://emilyoliviareynolds.com/">Emily Reynolds</a></p>
<p>There are plenty of things you can do in a five minute break at work — talk to a colleague, make a cup of tea or coffee, or even go outside for some fresh air. But with the advent of digital technology, many of us now spend the short lulls in our day doing something else: looking at our phones.</p>
<p>Previous research has already suggested (fairly unsurprisingly) that smartphone use increases as we get more bored or fatigued. It makes sense: if you’re doing a particularly tedious task at work, you’re much more likely to want to spend a few minutes scrolling on your phone than if you’re doing something deeply engaging.</p>
<p>But does looking at your phone actually <em>relieve</em> boredom? A new study from Jonas Dora and colleagues at Radboud University, available as a <a href="https://psyarxiv.com/uy8rs">preprint at </a><a href="https://psyarxiv.com/uy8rs"><em>PsyArXiv</em></a>, seems to suggest not.</p>
<p><span id="more-39336"></span></p>
<p>It wasn’t immediately clear whether smartphone use would increase or decrease fatigue and boredom. On one hand, previous research suggests that notifications significantly impact people’s ability to concentrate on major tasks; on the other, looking at your phone could provide what the authors refer to as a “microbreak”, allowing a small period in which to recover from the demands (and boredoms) of work.</p>
<p>To explore this relationship further, the team asked 83 participants to rate their level of fatigue and boredom every hour they were at work for three working days. An app had also been installed on their phones, which monitored smartphone use during the twenty minutes before and twenty minutes after these self-reports (times that overlapped with the start of end of work, or with lunch breaks, were omitted from analysis).</p>
<p>Phone breaks were extremely frequent: in the twenty minutes following each questionnaire, participants picked up their phone 52% of the time, spending an average of around ninety seconds on it each time.</p>
<p>As participants’ fatigue and boredom increased, so too did the frequency with which they looked at their phones. For instance,  a ten-point increase in boredom, on a 100-point scale, resulted in a 40% higher likelihood someone would reach for their phone (though there was no evidence that they spent any <em>longer </em>looking at their smartphones).</p>
<p>So did participants feel less bored after picking up their phones? Surprisingly, this wasn’t the case. Researchers looked at fatigue levels twenty minutes before self-reports, finding participants actually reported <em>higher</em> levels of boredom after having used their smartphones (though the effect size was admittedly small — a single digit increase on the 100-point scale).</p>
<p>There are two reasons why this might be the case. Switching between tasks — even between a boring task and an enriching one — can carry a cognitive load of its own, with the reward of a brief glance at a phone not enough to make up the deficit. And rather than being a motivating break, looking at a phone may simply underline the gap between the things you find taxing and the things you find invigorating — thus making you even more fed up and bored when you return to work.</p>
<p>This research had a small sample size, so it’s important not to draw too many definitive conclusions from its findings. But it’s not the only study to find a negative relationship between smartphone use and boredom levels. One <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2016/03/11/put-it-away-spending-work-breaks-on-your-smartphone-is-not-rejuvenating/">2016 paper</a> found that spending work breaks on the phone can lead to decreased levels of motivation: because you’re not allowing your mind to wander when you look at your phone, it suggested, you’re not getting any of the benefits you normally would during a break from work.</p>
<p>So next time you’re bored and feel yourself reaching for your smartphone, it might be an idea to resist it. Leaving your desk or even just looking out of the window for five minutes may be less compelling than what’s on your newsfeed — but you may find yourself less tired, less bored and less demotivated in the end.</p>

Last year, JAMA Ophthalmology published a study that claimed to find a link between using cholesterol-lowering drugs known as statins and a reduced risk of glaucoma. In a New York Times story on the paper, lead author Jae H. Kang, an assistant professor of medicine at Brigham and Women’s Hospital in Boston, suggested that statins … <a class="more-link" href="https://retractionwatch.com/2020/03/16/statins-may-cut-glaucoma-risk-said-a-ny-times-headline-turns-out-thats-not-true/">Continue reading <span class="screen-reader-text">“Statins May Cut Glaucoma Risk,” said a New York Times headline.

                <h4><a href="http://ankursinha.in/2020/03/15/a-vimscript-function-to-select-signatures-in-neomutt.html">A Vim script function to select signatures in Neomutt</a></h4>

<p>I've been using <a class="reference external" href="https://neomutt.org/">Neomutt</a> for a <a class="reference external" href="http://ankursinha.in/2017/12/16/transitioning-to-neomutt-and-friends-for-e-mail.html">while now</a>.
It allows me to stick to the <a class="reference external" href="https://www.byobu.org/">Byobu</a> based terminal workflow that I'm used to.
Most importantly, it lets me use <a class="reference external" href="https://www.vim.org/">Vim</a> to write my e-mails, so I don't need to
really learn another tool now.</p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="https://neomutt.org/">Neomutt</a> can be configured to add a signature at the end of the e-mail, and one
can select a signature depending on various parameters, such as the senders
address using <a class="reference external" href="https://neomutt.org/man/neomuttrc">hooks</a>. However,
sometimes, one does need to select other signatures.</p>
<p>The simple <a class="reference external" href="https://www.vim.org/">Vim</a> way, of course, is to simply delete the last few lines, and
then read in the new signature using <code>:r &lt;filename&gt;</code>. This takes a few
more key strokes than one would like (well, than I like) so I thought I'd
dabble in <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vim_(text_editor)#Vim_script">Vim script</a> a bit and automate it. Here's what I've come up with:</p>
<pre class="code vim literal-block"><span class="c">" A function to load the right signature when I'm using neomutt</span>

    <span class="k">else</span>
        echo <span class="s2">"File "</span> . sigfile . <span class="s2">" not found!"</span>
        echo <span class="s2">"Available signature files:\n"</span> . globpath<span class="p">(</span>sigdir<span class="p">,</span> <span class="s1">'*.sig'</span><span class="p">)</span>
    <span class="k">endif</span>
<span class="k">endfunction</span>
</pre>
<p>So, adding this to <code>~/.vimrc</code> would let one run <code>:call
LoadSignature('signature')</code> in <a class="reference external" href="https://www.vim.org/">Vim</a> to select a signature. Each signature is a
different file with a <code>.sig</code> file extension in the location given by
<code>sigdir</code>, and the name of the file is the argument that needs to be given
to the function. If the signature file cannot be found, it'll list available ones.</p>
<p>It's quite simple really, and I'm sure it can be made better, but it works.</p>

Spider researcher Jonathan Pruitt is accused by his coauthors of data manipulations, after 3 retractions they demand more. A lawyer's letter was supposed to stop that, but Pruitt tells me: "I'm happy for folks to engage in public discourse about my data integrity""

<p><strong>Despite tantalising headlines and claims from tech companies, we’re a long way from having computers that can read our minds</strong>.

<p><strong>A world-wide survey of dog owners has investigated how common anxiety-related behaviours are in different breeds</strong>, <a href="https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2020/03/your-dog-anxious-genes-common-its-breed-could-play-role">reports Michael Price</a> at <em>Science</em>. About a third of all dogs displayed noise sensitivity (e.g. during fireworks and thunder), and many were scared of other dogs, strangers or new situations. But the pattern of anxiety varied between breeds: Labradors were barely ever wary of strangers, for instance, while Lagotto Romagnolos were particularly scared of loud noises.</p>

<p><strong>Lacking the words to describe an experience can leave us blind to its occurrence: this is known as a state of “hypocognition”,</strong> <a href="https://aeon.co/ideas/hypocognition-is-a-censorship-tool-that-mutes-what-we-can-feel">writes Kaidi Wu</a> at <em>Aeon</em>. But as we learn or develop new language and wrap our heads around new concepts, Wu writes, we “give meaning to walks of life previously starved of recognition”.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>Also at <em>Aeon</em>: <a href="https://aeon.co/ideas/testosterone-is-widely-and-sometimes-wildly-misunderstood">Matthew Gutmann breaks down some of the myths</a> about testosterone</strong>, writing that early studies on the effects of testosterone were fatally flawed — and that the hormone has been used at times as an excuse for men’s behaviour.</p>

<p><strong>The culture we live in is undoubtedly a huge force on the kinds of decisions that we make in our lives</strong>. But other factors like advertising and the media have less of an impact than you might think, <a href="https://theconversation.com/free-thought-can-you-ever-be-a-truly-independent-thinker-129033">writes Tom Stafford</a> at <em>The Conversation</em>.</p>

<p>This episode is an exploration of glial cells with R Douglas Fields, author of "<a href="https://amzn.to/2W5xVfA" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="amazon">The Other Brain: The Scientific and Medical Breakthroughs That Will Heal Our Brains and Revolutionize Our Health</a>." Glial Cells outnumber the neurons in our nervous system, but until the last few years they were thought to merely support cells. Dr. Fields takes us through the discovery that they have their own signaling methods and are much more important than we ever imagined.</p> <p>This interview first aired in 2010, but Dr. Fields reviewed the original transcript and made no significant corrections.

<p>As the global impact of COVID-19 becomes apparent, we write to share updates relevant to the arXiv community.</p>
<p>Currently, arXiv is unaffected by the outbreak and continues to operate as usual. Our intention is to maintain the same speed and service that our community values so deeply. As arXiv’s scientific director Steinn Sigurdsson said, “With quarantines and major conferences being cancelled, arXiv will be as important as ever to sharing research.”</p>
<p>At the same time, we acknowledge that our team is global, and the situation is evolving rapidly. Our highest priority is the health and safety of our community, and we recognize that staff and volunteer moderators may need to take time off to address their personal well-being.</p>
<p>While we plan to keep papers flowing as much as possible, we need to accept that delays might happen. We hope that by keeping open communication among moderators, staff, and users, we can avoid any major disruptions. If your paper is delayed, we graciously ask for your patience.</p>
<p>As a reminder, we’ve added a<a href="https://status.arxiv.org"> status page</a> that will allow anyone to monitor and subscribe to updates around arXiv’s operational status, including planned maintenance, unscheduled outages, and other events that may affect the availability of arXiv services. More information about the status page is available on our recent<a href="https://blogs.cornell.edu/arxiv/2020/03/02/communicating-arxivs-operational-status/"> blog post</a>.</p>

<p><em>By </em><a href="http://emilyoliviareynolds.com/">Emily Reynolds</a></p>
<p>There’s been a lot of back and forth about the psychological effects of taking and sharing selfies. Some <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30149282">research</a> suggests that taking pictures of yourself can dent your self-esteem and increase anxiety, while <a href="https://www.emerald.com/insight/content/doi/10.1108/EJM-07-2015-0512/full/html">other studies</a> have found that selfies can be a source of empowerment; one <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2017/02/23/taking-a-selfie-could-dent-your-self-esteem-unless-you-share-it/">2017 paper</a> even found a combination of the two, suggesting that sharing selfies online can mitigate the damage to self-image often inflicted when a selfie is actually taken.</p>
<p>The hundreds of op-eds, articles and TV features that continue to focus on the issue also suggest that our interest in the phenomenon is unlikely to abate any time soon. And now a <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/17482798.2019.1697319">new study</a> published in the <em>Journal of Children and Media</em> has added to the debate.</p>
<p>It suggests that <em>taking</em> selfies may not be as damaging as other research has claimed. Instead, it’s what you do after you’ve taken the photo that matters: it’s editing images that really hurts our self-esteem.</p>
<p><span id="more-39322"></span>Larissa Terán and colleagues at the University of Arizona first asked 278 teenage girls, aged 14 to 17, about their selfie activities. Participants rated how frequently they share selfies, and were then asked how often they edited their pictures using various different tools (e.g. getting rid of red eye, smoothing skin or making themselves look thinner using editing apps). They were then asked about selfie investment: how much effort and time they spent choosing photos of themselves to post online, as well as how concerned they were about the reception these posts receive.</p>
<p>Next, a questionnaire looked at self-objectification, a phenomenon in which people view themselves as objects rather than human beings. Participants were asked to select how much they identified with statements including “looking attractive to others is more important to me than being happy with who I am” and “I try to imagine what my body looks like to others”.</p>
<p>Participants were then given questions on appearance anxiety, rating how tense they feel when people look at them or when they feel they are being negatively perceived, as well as questions on how ashamed they feel about their appearance and on how they would evaluate their own looks.</p>
<p>As hypothesised, those who spent more time editing, thinking and worrying about selfies were more likely to see themselves as objects than those who did not. This self-objectification, in turn, was linked to greater anxiety and body shame amongst participants, and worse evaluation of their own looks. That is, people who invested more into thinking about or editing selfies tended to have more negative feelings about their own body — and that seemed to be because they were prone to self-objectification.</p>
<p>Interestingly enough — and as the <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2017/02/23/taking-a-selfie-could-dent-your-self-esteem-unless-you-share-it/">2017 paper</a> also suggested — <em>sharing</em> selfies more frequently was not significantly associated with greater self-objectification nor with increased levels of body shame.</p>
<p>The authors have several suggestions as to why simply sharing selfies wasn’t related to negative body image. Pictures may not always be shared with appearance in mind: sometimes teens want to demonstrate who they’re friends with, what they’re interested in or what they’ve been doing. In fact, the team found some evidence that greater selfie sharing was linked to <em>better</em> self-image — meaning posting pictures of oneself might actually <em>decrease</em> shame about looks.</p>
<p>Whether there is actually a causal relationship between these factors, however, is not so clear. It could be that editing selfies contributes to concerns about appearance — that the process of editing, in other words, actively increases body shame. But there is also a distinct possibility that those who <em>already</em> have negative body image are more likely to edit pictures in the first place: their self-esteem is already wavering or low, so they feel the need to edit out hated flaws.</p>
<p>If the results truly are reflective of how teenage girls perceive their selfie taking activities, it may be more accurate to say that the <em>context</em> in which selfies are taken and shared are more important than anything inherent to the act itself. So rather than condemning teenage girls for taking selfies — or banning them from taking them, if you’re a parent — it may be more useful to understand <em>why</em> they’re doing it in the first place.</p>

<img alt="" class="attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image" height="110" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2020/03/World-Kidney-day-2020-140x110.jpg" style="display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;" width="140" /><p>Chronic kidney disease (CKD) affects 850 million people worldwide.  This global health burden continues to increase each year.  There are no symptoms in early CKD.  It is not until CKD has progressed to the point of needing dialysis that patients develop recognizable symptoms.  This means that it is vital that patients are screened for CKD, since early diagnosis can prevent the progression of kidney disease.  <strong><a href="https://www.worldkidneyday.org/2020-campaign/2020-wkd-theme/">World Kidney Day</a></strong> on 12th March 2020 will focus on <strong>“Kidney Health for Everyone Everywhere – from Prevention to Detection and Equitable Access to Care”</strong>.  Primary care providers (PCPs) are on the frontline against CKD progression by making the early diagnosis.</p>
<p>A <a href="https://bmcnephrol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12882-020-01731-x">systematic review</a> by Neale <em>et al., </em>published today in <em>BMC Nephrology,</em> evaluated the barriers and enablers to the diagnosis and management of CKD in primary care.  Most reviews focus on barriers<em> or</em> enablers but this article was able to address both, which go hand-in-hand in helping PCPs tackle the growing health burden of CKD.  Twenty studies were included in the review. The most common barriers identified were lack of time, fear of delivering the CKD diagnosis, and dissatisfaction with CKD guidelines.  The most common enablers were the presence of supportive technology to identify and manage CKD and collaborative relationships among members of the healthcare team. These and some other identified barriers and enablers from Neale <em>et al. </em>are listed in table 1.</p>

<h3><strong>Strategies to Enhance Early Detection and Management</strong></h3>
<p>Healthcare professionals frequently complain of the inadequate amount of time they can spend with patients. However, PCPs have one of the highest workloads, managing preventative care, acute complaints, multiple co-morbidities, etc.  Developing strategies to streamline the identification and management of CKD through electronic medical records and increasing the use of calculators for estimated GFR and kidney failure risk would benefit PCPs.  In addition, <a href="https://www.bmj.com/content/bmj/350/bmj.h176.full.pdf">adopting policies</a> that enable longer consultations for complex patients will allow protected time to deal with the management of chronic diseases like CKD.</p>
<blockquote><p>Effective co-management of patients with CKD between PCPs and nephrologists is recognized as a key strategy to deliver high-quality CKD care.</p></blockquote>
<p>Improving CKD knowledge and confidence in diagnosis will empower PCPs to provide early diagnosis.  If patients know they have CKD in the primary care setting, they can take steps to increase their own CKD knowledge and self-management of CKD, promoting future favorable outcomes. <a href="https://reader.elsevier.com/reader/sd/pii/S0272638614010610?token=595049B828280D60DE74EE3A6F2A4F0DFFA62F5357753C421BE25E03C6210DA1999D18113CA869B6495D8EF3AB581D07">One study</a> implemented a toolkit to enhance awareness of CKD among PCPs.  This quality improvement activity led to greater identification of CKD, increased referral to nephrology, increased communication among PCPs and nephrologists, and the development of co-management plans. Toolkits like this one should be used more frequently for providing continuing education and resources for our PCPs.</p>
<p>Guidelines rarely deal with comorbidities, but practice guidelines that consider the co-morbid nature of CKD would increase understanding and use among PCPs.  It will help with prioritizing the patient’s problem list and management strategies.  One potential solution is to develop guidelines that consider common clusters of chronic conditions. <a href="http://www.european-renal-best-practice.org/content/erbp-documents-topic">ERBP</a>, <a href="https://kdigo.org/guidelines/">KDIGO</a> and <a href="https://www.kidney.org/professionals/guidelines/guidelines_commentaries">KDOQI</a> have already started to address this by providing guidelines on CKD and co-morbidities such as diabetes mellitus, hepatitis C, and cardiovascular disease.</p>
<p><a href="https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s11606-019-04975-y.pdf">Effective co-management of patients</a> with CKD between PCPs and nephrologists is recognized as a key strategy to deliver high-quality CKD care.  Interventions facilitating the exchange of information, clear delineation of roles/responsibilities, and greater access to specialist advice improve the co-management of patients with CKD.</p>
<p>PCPs and nephrologists working together in a multi-disciplinary team to care of these complex patients can only lead to future healthcare benefits.</p>

<p>This week on Journal Club session Ohki Katakura will talk about the paper "Spatiotemporal network coding of physiological mossy fiber inputs by the cerebellar granular layer".</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>The granular layer, which mainly consists of granule and Golgi cells, is the first stage of the cerebellar cortex and processes spatiotemporal information transmitted by mossy fiber inputs with a wide variety of firing patterns. To study its dynamics at multiple time scales in response to inputs approximating real spatiotemporal patterns, we constructed a large-scale 3D network model of the granular layer. Patterned mossy fiber activity induces rhythmic Golgi cell activity that is synchronized by shared parallel fiber input and by gap junctions. This leads to long distance synchrony of Golgi cells along the transverse axis, powerfully regulating granule cell firing by imposing inhibition during a specific time window. The essential network mechanisms, including tunable Golgi cell oscillations, on-beam inhibition and NMDA receptors causing first winner keeps winning of granule cells, illustrate how fundamental properties of the granule layer operate in tandem to produce (1) well timed and spatially bound output, (2) a wide dynamic range of granule cell firing and (3) transient and coherent gating oscillations. These results substantially enrich our understanding of granule cell layer processing, which seems to promote spatial group selection of granule cell activity as a function of timing of mossy fiber input.</p>

<p><i>By</i> <a href="https://emmayoung.net/">Emma Young</a></p>
<p>Does the language that you speak influence what you think? And do languages that assign a gender to most nouns — such as French and Spanish — lead speakers to feel differently about women versus men, compared with languages that don’t — such as Chinese? Both questions have been hotly debated. But now a major <a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/doiLanding?doi=10.1037/pspa0000188">new study</a>, involving an analysis of millions of pages of text in 45 different languages from all over the world, concludes that gendered languages shape prejudice against women.</p>
<p><span id="more-39315"></span>Gendered languages, such as French and Spanish, Russian and Hindi, dictate that most nouns are male or female. For example, “the ball” is<em> la pelota</em> (female) in Spanish and <em>le ballon</em> (male) in French. In these languages, adjectives and verbs also change slightly depending on the gender of the noun. Then there’s a group of “natural gender” languages, in which nouns aren’t gendered, but pronouns do reflect gender (such as <em>he</em> and <em>she</em> in English, which belongs to this group.) Finally, there are genderless languages, in which a pronoun can refer to either gender, such as Chinese and Finnish.</p>
<p>Earlier research has found that in countries where gendered languages are spoken, women earn lower wages and are less likely to succeed in politics. But researchers have questioned whether the nature of the language itself has anything to do with this. Perhaps, some have suggested, languages simply reflect differences in broader cultural attitudes to men and women.</p>
<p>In the new study, David DeFranza and colleagues at the University of Utah used a technique called Natural Language Processing (NLP) to analyse vast amounts of text taken from Wikipedia and the Common Crawl project, which holds snapshots of text taken from the internet since 2013, comprising more than 630 billion words. Text in 45 different languages, which include the first or second languages of more than half of the world’s population, were included.</p>
<p>The NLP software scanned these texts, looking for close co-occurrences of gender words (such as <em>woman</em>, <em>she</em>, <em>hers</em>, <em>her</em> and <em>man</em>, <em>he</em>, <em>his</em>, <em>him</em> in English) and positive or negative terms. The list of positive terms included <em>love</em>, <em>pleasure</em> and <em>lucky</em>, for example, while the negative terms included <em>abuse</em>, <em>sickness</em> and <em>ugly</em>.</p>
<p>The team found that the gendered languages were much more likely to show skewed associations, with more positive terms being associated with men than with women. For example, in the Commons Crawl component of the study, 19 of the 28 gendered languages used in this analysis — 67% — showed this pattern, whereas none of the 17 genderless languages did.</p>
<p>Various geographic, cultural and demographic factors have been shown to influence gender equality. But the team did control for various of these factors in their analysis (for example, they used data from the Global Gender Gap index developed by the World Economic Forum and the Human Development Index, developed by the UNDP), and the effect still held. “Using languages that span continents and cultures, we find evidence that gender prejudice exists more in gendered languages,” they conclude.</p>
<p>A further analysis used a similar method to explore gender stereotypes within these languages. The team found that in gendered, but not genderless, languages, male words, more than female words, were associated with being “competent”, “skilful” and “confident” (attributes traditionally associated more with men than women) but also “warm” (which traditionally has been associated more with women). In gendered languages, men are seen in a more positive light, overall, it seems.</p>
<p>What might explain this pro-male bias?</p>
<p>The researchers speculate that as gendered languages personify even inanimate objects with a specific gender, the regular use of such terms could frequently, unconsciously reinforce implicit attitudes about men and women. So, if men are traditionally viewed in a more positive light, using masculine nouns could bring to mind the positive associations regarding masculinity and reinforce a pro-male bias. If this is how the effect works, then the broader attitudes of a culture are clearly important, but language type has its own role to play.</p>
<p>There are a few limitations to the study. Most notably, this is an analysis of written text on the internet. Perhaps it doesn’t accurately reflect the attitudes of societies more broadly. However, this text was voluntarily produced by millions of people, and it’s debatable whether studies that involve asking people what they think are better at revealing actual beliefs. Indeed, the researchers argue that their work shows the value of analysing the extraordinary amounts of text held in Wikipedia and Common Crawl for research in social psychology.</p>
<p>Future studies could explore whether other stereotypes, not considered in this study — such as weakness vs power, home vs career, or perceptions of emotional versus rational decision-making — might show different patterns of gender association in gendered vs genderless languages, the team suggests.</p>

<p><strong><em>A case of genetic testing</em></strong></p>
<p>Samila* had been suffering from shortness of breath and exhaustion when, at the age of 19, she was diagnosed with a heart that did not pump properly. Attempting to understand what caused this condition, her cardiologist suggested genetic testing. The test showed no underlying genetic factors for her heart issues and her medication was so effective that Samila thought it all might have been a fluke. However, when she was 26, her cardiologist unexpectedly contacted her with some upsetting information: part of her DNA had been identified as being involved in the development of dilated cardiomyopathy.</p>
<p>*<em>Fictionalized case</em></p>
<p><strong><em>Genetic testing: uncertainty amidst possible expectations of certainty </em></strong></p>
<p>A genetic test inspects parts or even the entirety of the genome, which contains all our hereditary information encoded in the DNA.</p>
<p>The field of human genetics studies the workings of human genomes and how variations within it might play a role in the development of medical conditions. Through these studies, our genes can offer us important insights into why we have developed certain conditions, whether we could develop them in the future, and whether our children are at increased risk of developing them.</p>
<p>We frequently attribute a great deal of certainty to genetic testing and the information it produces in terms of what it can tell us regarding current and future health risks. However, for all our expectations, the connection between our genes and discuss our health is anything but clear-cut. The information provided by genetic testing often contains a multitude of uncertainties.</p>
<p>One such uncertainty is that the meaning of genetic information can change over time. Depending on the moment a genetic test is performed or its data interpreted, patients may receive different results. This can be unsettling for patients and pose a real challenge to genetic professionals.</p>
<p><strong><em>Stable genomes, changing understandings</em></strong></p>
<p>People change, their genomes do not. Our genome is inherited at conception and generally stays constant beyond the day we die. Patients like Samila may, therefore, wonder why they receive new genetic information many years later after their DNA was initially “cleared”. Despite its fixed nature, our understanding and interpretation of the genome is anything but stable.</p>
<p>Genetic testing enables us to inspect an individual genome for variations that differ from a template (i.e. ‘the’ human reference genome). Everyone has millions of variations that differ from this reference, but most are harmless or even beneficial. For patients, then, we need to establish whether these variations can explain or predict conditions or whether they are innocent.</p>
<figure class="wp-caption alignright" id="attachment_11758" style="width: 310px;"><img alt="Suspect gene" class="wp-image-11758 size-medium" height="198" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2020/03/Fig-1-300x198.jpg" width="300" /><div class="attachment-image--caption">Professionals in human genetics might be likened to molecular detectives. <em>Illustration by Julia El Mecky.</em></div><div class="attachment-image--source"></div></figure>
<p>In this sense, geneticists are kind of molecular detectives. They uncover evidence in order to ascertain whether their “suspects” – i.e. variations in an individual’s genome – are guilty or innocent regarding the development of specific conditions.</p>
<p>Complicating the task of reviewing evidence, like in an actual criminal investigation, is that new evidence might unfold as time passes. This new evidence may redefine how genetic variation might be involved in medical conditions.</p>
<p>In Samila’s case, for instance, it was uncertain if some of the initially identified genetic variation was harmless or suspicious. But as time went on, more patients with the same condition appeared to have this genetic variation, which indeed could be associated with cardiomyopathy.</p>
<p><strong><em>New evidence: important implications for patients</em></strong></p>
<figure class="wp-caption alignleft" id="attachment_11759" style="width: 270px;"><img alt="Guilty gene" class="wp-image-11759 size-medium" height="300" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2020/03/Fig-2-260x300.jpg" width="260" /><div class="attachment-image--caption">New evidence can change the “verdict” that is given to genetic variation. <em>Illustration by Julia El Mecky</em>.</div><div class="attachment-image--source"></div></figure>
<p>Evolving genetic evidence can have significant implications for patients and their relatives in terms of treatment decisions, medical protocols, and life decisions.</p>
<p>In Samila’s case, this new interpretation indicated a chronic heart condition that was likely to progress, irrespective of any treatment. Samila was advised to look for a job that was not too stressful. Her children have a 50% chance of having the genetic variation, putting them at higher risk of developing a similar condition.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong><em>Challenges for professionals in genetic healthcare</em></strong></p>
<p>New genetic technologies produce information regarding genetic variation at unprecedented rates, continuously providing new data on the relationship between genetic variation and medical conditions as time moves on.</p>
<p>The changing nature of genetic knowledge raises highly challenging questions for professionals.</p>
<p>For instance, a laboratory geneticist’s role is to interpret the meaning of genetic variation. What are their responsibilities with respect to identifying and providing up-to-date, important health information to individuals who have been tested in the past?</p>
<p>If laboratories would enact a policy of routinely inspecting all new evidence and update the interpretation of genetic data in their registry, patients such as Samila could receive vital medical information at an earlier time. Samila might then have considered measures to prevent her children from inheriting the genetic variation.</p>
<p>However, the workload for professionals to review massive amounts of new evidence is exorbitant and would strain resources, potentially cutting into time spent on other healthcare-related activities. Should the responsibility therefore lie with Samila or her primary care practitioner to regularly request updated interpretations?</p>
<p>It is crucial that these issues are explored through research that includes the perspectives of those involved. Our <a href="https://bmcmedgenomics.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12920-019-0612-6?utm_source=bmc_blogs&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=null&amp;utm_campaign=blog_2020_bmcseriesblog">study </a>looks at these questions in the context of the genetic laboratory. We invite everyone interested to read this paper, which raises important points of consideration for clinical genetics practice.</p>

<p><em>By</em> <a href="https://twitter.com/mattbwarren">Matthew Warren</a></p>
<p>When studying for exams, it can be tempting to just re-read textbooks or attempt to memorise your notes. But psychologists know that there are actually much more effective ways of learning — they just require a bit of extra effort.</p>
<p>A <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/acp.3639?af=R">recent paper</a> in <em>Applied Cognitive Psychology </em>has highlighted two of these superior strategies. The team finds that university students whose revision involves testing themselves or making up questions about course material perform better in a later exam than those who simply restudy their notes.<span id="more-39311"></span></p>
<p>Past research had already shown that generating questions or <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2013/09/09/the-digest-guide-to-studying/">being tested</a> during the learning process helps people retain information better than passively trying to absorb knowledge. These strategies are considered “desirable difficulties” that make the learning process harder or more effortful, but which are ultimately beneficial. But many previous studies only examined people’s ability to learn in the lab, or had tested them very soon after the learning phase. In real life, of course, people learn in places like schools and universities, and tests may occur days or weeks after studying.</p>
<p>So Mirjam Ebersbach and colleagues from the University of Kassel decided to test the effectiveness of these strategies in an actual educational context. The team recruited 82 German university students in a developmental psychology lecture and assigned them to one of three conditions. All three groups were given a print-out of 10 slides from the lecture (which was about the development of knowledge in infants), but each group studied the material in different ways. The “restudy” group was told to simply memorise the content of each slide. The “testing” group was given a question for each slide which they had to answer (they were allowed to look at the content in the slides if they weren’t able to answer initially). Finally, the “generating questions” group had to come up with test questions themselves, based on the content of each slide.</p>
<p>A week later, participants were given a surprise exam based on the information they had studied. Students had to answer five factual questions that directly related to the content they had learned, as well as five “transfer” questions, in which they had to apply the knowledge to new contexts.</p>
<p>Overall, participants who had only restudied the material scored a little under 45% on the test. By contrast, those who had answered or generated questions during the learning phase scored 11 percentage points higher, on average. Both of these strategies were significantly better than restudying, but neither was better than the other.</p>
<p>When the researchers analysed scores on the factual and transfer questions separately, they found some preliminary evidence that the two methods produced better results than restudying for both kinds of question. This suggests that the strategies help people to not only learn facts, but also apply that knowledge to new contexts.</p>
<p>Of course, the study has some important limitations. Most notably, the sample size was very small — groups ranged from 22 to 30 participants — so it will be important to replicate the findings in larger samples. And, as the researchers point out, their participants were all university students and so were presumably fairly good learners, or at least had plenty of experience studying and sitting exams. It remains to be seen whether these strategies are just as helpful in real-life situations for younger people or those who face greater difficulty absorbing new information.</p>
<p>Still, the results have clear applications for those looking to boost their learning. “Our results suggest that the two learning strategies, which are both clearly more effective than simple restudying, can be recommended by (university) teachers to learners and can also be recommended for (self-regulated) learning,” the authors conclude.</p>

Why is it so difficult to correct the scientific record in sports science? In the first installment in this series of guest posts, Matthew Tenan, a data scientist with a PhD in neuroscience, began the story of how he and some colleagues came to scrutinize a paper. In this post, he explains what happened next. … <a class="more-link" href="https://retractionwatch.com/2020/03/10/a-flawed-decision-what-happened-when-sports-scientists-tried-to-correct-the-scientific-record-part-2/">Continue reading <span class="screen-reader-text">‘A flawed decision:’ What happened when sports scientists tried to correct the scientific record, part 2</span></a>

<p><em>By </em><a href="http://emilyoliviareynolds.com/">Emily Reynolds</a></p>
<p>Scrolling through Facebook or Instagram, it can be easy to feel drawn in by the people you follow. Whether it’s the brands they’re buying, the things they’re doing or what they’re wearing, it’s not uncommon to want to follow suit — they’re called “influencers” for a reason, after all.</p>
<p>This isn’t only true of those who are paid to influence, however: those we know in “real life” and follow on social media can also impact the decisions we make. In a <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0195666319310359?via%3Dihub">new study</a> published in <em>Appetite</em><em>, </em>Lily Hawkins and colleagues at Aston University find that what we think our online friends are eating can influence how healthy (or not) our own diets are.<span id="more-39305"></span></p>
<p>The team asked 369 university students to fill in a survey about their perceptions of Facebook users’ food habits and preferences — how many servings of vegetables they believed an average Facebook user to eat every day, for example — and what they felt users’ food habits <em>should</em> be. They were also asked to rate how much they identified with the label of “Facebook user” themselves.</p>
<p>Next, a set of questions explored participants’ own eating styles: how able they feel to restrain themselves around food, how emotional their eating tends to be, and how often they engage in uncontrolled eating. They also filled in a food frequency questionnaire, which measured how often they ate various food types, and reported how many servings of fruit, vegetables and snacks they usually consumed.</p>
<p>Finally, the participants answered questions on their mood and appetite whilst completing the study, and on lifestyle factors like BMI.</p>
<p>The results showed that perceived norms amongst Facebook users did in fact predict how often participants ate fruit and vegetables. The more participants felt their Facebook friends were eating fruit and veg, the more they ate themselves. Meanwhile, participants’ consumption of unhealthy snacks and sugary drinks was influenced by how much they thought Facebook users <em>should</em> eat junk food.</p>
<p>How much Facebook users were perceived to <em>like</em> a particular food did not have a significant effect, however; participants’ own habits were only influenced by what they believed users were actually consuming, or should be consuming. That is, people tended to match whatever pattern of consumption they felt to be the norm.</p>
<p>Though our eating habits may be affected by perceptions of how other people are eating, the impact on our actual health may be limited: these perceptions were not linked to differences in participants’ BMI, a factor the team hopes to follow up on longer term.</p>
<p>The idea that online friends influence our lives so directly is compelling, but there were some notable limitations to the study. Firstly, only <em>perceived</em> norms were measured. What participants were actually seeing when they logged onto Facebook was ignored, but may prove to have an impact on what they were eating. And only 81% of participants were actually on Facebook — 19% didn’t have an account, so their perceptions of the average Facebook user may have missed the mark entirely.</p>
<p>Still, the study provides some insights into how perceptions of online norms influence the way we ourselves eat. It seems to differ depending on what’s being eaten. Healthy eating appears to be guided by other people’s behaviour, while our consumption of unhealthy foods is related to how likely we feel to be judged for our consumption — an effect that can be particularly potent online, the team suggests, where many of us feel a need for social acceptance.</p>
<p>This also suggests that social media could be used as a tool to “nudge” people into more healthy behaviours — potentially a useful public health intervention when it comes to encouraging healthy diets. But ensuring these nudges encourage positive behaviour, rather than shaming those who are more unhealthy, could be a factor worth further attention.</p>

<p><strong>Psychology news seems to be taking a backseat in the media this week as concerns about coronavirus mount around the world. </strong>But psychologists also have much to contribute when it comes to understanding the current crisis and our responses to it.<span id="more-39301"></span></p>
<p>At <em>BBC Future</em>, <a href="https://www.bbc.com/worklife/article/20200304-coronavirus-covid-19-update-why-people-are-stockpiling">Bryan Lufkin examines the reasons that people panic buy</a>, a phenomenon that is leaving some supermarket shelves empty and making it harder for healthcare professionals to get goods they need, such as face masks. And <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/science/2020/mar/06/dont-let-coronavirus-tip-society-into-panic-say-psychologists">psychologists are urging authorities to prevent further anxiety and panic</a> by providing clear information and accounting for “herd behaviour”, Hannah Devlin reports in <em>The Guardian.</em></p>
<p>We’ve all been told to stop touching our faces — but although it seems like a simple preventative action, it turns out to be much easier said than done. At <em>The New York Times</em>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/05/health/stop-touching-your-face.html">Jenny Gross talks to psychologists and other academics</a> about some of the ways to stop the habit.</p>

<p><strong>In more uplifting news, scientists have found that humans are not the only creatures able to use statistical information to make decisions: so can kea, the mischievous alpine parrots native to New Zealand,</strong> <a href="https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2020/03/new-zealand-birds-show-humanlike-ability-make-predictions">reports Virginia Morell</a> at <em>Science</em>.  Researchers first taught kea that a black token was associated with food. They then showed the kea two transparent jars containing black and orange tokens, and removed a token from each with a closed hand. The kea tended to pick whichever hand had taken a token from the jar with the greater proportion of black to orange tokens, suggesting that they had used this statistical information to figure out which hand offered the best chance of getting a food reward.</p>

<p><strong>If you want to write a hit song, make sure to use the word “you” in it a lot. </strong>Researchers have found that songs that make it higher up the charts have a greater proportion of “you”s in them, <a href="https://www.discovermagazine.com/mind/people-like-songs-about-you">writes Neuroskeptic</a> at <em>Discover Magazine</em>. The team thinks this may be because hearing about “you” helps listeners to imagine the story of the song applying to someone in their own lives.</p>

<p><b>The United Nations has released a new report on social norms regarding </b><strong>gender</strong><strong>, finding that almost 90% of people around the world show some level of prejudice against women</strong><span>. Interviewees were asked to respond to seven statements like “Men make better political leaders than women do” and “University is more important for a man than for a woman”. Only 10% of men and 14% of women showed no bias against women on any of these measures, </span><a href="https://qz.com/1812802/un-study-finds-almost-90-of-men-and-women-are-biased-against-women/">reports Annalisa Merelli</a><span> at </span><em>Quartz</em><span>.</span></p>

<p><strong>Finally, the American Psychological Association has reaffirmed that playing violent video games is not linked to an increase in real-life violence</strong>, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2020/03/apa-warns-against-linking-violent-video-games-to-real-world-violence/">reports Kyle Orland</a> at <em>Ars Technica</em>. However, the APA’s guidance also states that violent video games <em>are</em> related to small increases in aggressive behaviour, which <a href="https://twitter.com/patmarkey/status/1235215442848997377?s=20">some psychologists debate</a>. Amongst other factors, they point to recent null findings in preregistered studies — such as <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2019/03/06/these-violent-delights-dont-have-violent-ends-study-finds-no-link-between-violent-video-games-and-teen-aggression/">this one</a> we covered last year.</p>

This post gives a little bit of context about the “why” behind this work (and for the design nerds  more keenly interested in the background and some of our process… this is for you!)</span></p>
<p><b>So much has changed… but our “look” hadn’t. </b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Scientific communication has changed since PLOS’ original founding (transforming it has been our </span><a href="https://plos.org/about/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">mission</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> from the very beginning). Open Access is no longer a new idea. And while PLOS remains one of the original pioneers of OA in the global north, Open Access itself is increasingly mainstream. Yet, our look, feel, and color palette has been static for 7+years. And the PLOS “globe” logo had been essentially unchanged since our founding in 2003. (That’s a long time!)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Developing a “look” true to PLOS’ roots, while truly visually new, felt daunting at times. Could we develop a visual brand reflective of the trust our communities place in us that ALSO shows our energy and willingness to break boundaries along the way? Can we capture both our expertise AND daring? And could our “look” channel the passion and excitement we experience daily in our work with researchers all over the world?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We knew we wanted to maintain a connection between the old and new. This work hasn’t been about starting from scratch but about moving forward. Here’s a peek behind the scenes. </span></p>
<p><b>The design process</b><b> </b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We were voracious in seeking out inspiration, resulting in many, many storyboards from our incredibly talented in-house designer (more about her later…). While we’d love to share all her research, here’s a snapshot of some of our favorite themes: </span></p>

</a><b>Use of overlapping shapes: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">We’ve created interesting details by zooming in and out; layering colors and transparencies; and creating new, more complex shapes by overlapping simpler ones. This was inspired by our intersecting communities and the multiple ways we work with them!</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And here’s our logo’s journey, with the final result!</span></p>

<img alt="" class="attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image" height="110" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2020/03/placenta-2433431_640-140x110.jpg" style="display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;" width="140" /><p>Almost every animal on the planet which produces a placenta eats it after birth. There are only a few exceptions to this rule – aquatic animals, camels, and humans.</p>
<p>In fact, humans are so averse to eating our own placentas after birth that it has not been recorded by any culture anywhere in the world in all of human history. We have buried them, burned them and occasionally sold them as medicine to other people, but <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/03670244.2010.524106?casa_token=FRqe63-3CvwAAAAA%3A8UeE7jzb_OoZFMOjR5MnZKqzSlvG2YrCDtoXn8r1cyYnXK-eA_RMtkOrxHGsOQXvEJa_c2T33oPU">as far as we know</a>, we have never routinely eaten our own. That is, <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/03670244.2012.719356?journalCode=gefn20">until the 1970s</a>, when the practice started spreading.</p>
<p>“Post-partum human maternal placentophagy” is the term for the phenomena of the birthing parent eating their own placenta after they have given birth. It is something which existing research indicates is <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/03670244.2012.719356?journalCode=gefn20&amp;">done almost exclusively by married, heterosexual, middle- or upper-class white women in the Global North</a>.</p>
<h3><strong>But why?</strong></h3>
<p>In order to answer that question, we can look in the place where people are already talking about it: the internet. More specifically, <a href="https://bmcpregnancychildbirth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12884-020-2824-3?utm_source=bmc_blogs&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=null&amp;utm_campaign=blog_2020_bmcseriesblog">our research</a>, published in <a href="https://bmcpregnancychildbirth.biomedcentral.com/?utm_source=bmc_blogs&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=null&amp;utm_campaign=blog_2020_bmcseriesblog"><em>BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth</em></a>, looked at threads posted on the UK parenting forums Mumsnet and Netmums and analysed them to see if common themes could be established.</p>
<blockquote><p>Parenting forums can be important spaces for women to seek advice, including about placentophagy.</p></blockquote>
<p>What we found was that people usually decide to eat their placentas because they either previously had, or felt they were at risk of, a negative experience during birth and the post-partum period. Most commonly, these were women who had existing mental health problems or had previously experienced post-natal depression (PND) and were worried about a recurrence. PND can be an awful, isolating and stigmatized condition and people were willing to seek a broad range of possible preventative measures – including eating their placenta.</p>
<p>The rationale for this is that in the immediate postpartum period, the birthing parent experiences a large and sudden drop in pregnancy-related hormones that can result in low mood and energy. The placenta produces a lot of those hormones and so re-ingesting it could replace some of them. The theory is that taking placenta in the form of an encapsulated pill once or twice a day over a period of time can mitigate some of that loss and therefore reduce or treat depression, induce lactation, boost mood, reduce cramps, improve energy and so on. According to existing research, there is no evidence that this is true (and <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1871519217302081?via%3Dihub">fairly good evidence</a> that it has no impact on these things), but that does not stop the popularity of the practice.</p>
<h3><strong>Popularity of placentophagy</strong></h3>
<p>There are a few potential factors increasing this popularity. Nobody finds the idea of eating a placenta particularly appetizing. The practice of encapsulation (steaming and/or dehydrating, grinding up and placing the placenta into capsules) helps alleviate the potential unpleasantness, making the practice palatable to more people. This process costs somewhere between £100-400 to pay someone else to do. For those who are handy, there are DIY guides and kits that can be purchased online. Some may instead choose to mix the placenta with fruit in a smoothie, or consume it some other way, but encapsulation is by far the most popular method. The media attention on the topic has also helped push it into the public view and the internet is being used as a tool for sharing logistical information and overcoming potential barriers to practice.</p>
<blockquote><p>Placentophagy can be understood as a way of exerting control and managing fears around birth.</p></blockquote>
<p>The data we looked at also demonstrated that parenting forums can be important spaces for women to establish normative parenting values and seek advice, including about placentophagy. Whilst there were the expected jokes about it, there was also an emphasis on personal choice, bodily autonomy and the value of each other’s experiences to support those who had done or were considering the practice.</p>
<h3><strong>Motivations and concerns</strong></h3>
<p>We conclude that placentophagy can be understood as being practiced as a way of exerting control and managing fears around birth and the birthing experience. It is medically legitimized through its similarity to medication and the sterile procedures used to create the “pills,” yet there is also an element of eschewing medical or scientific advice and seeking knowledge from people who have been in the same situation.</p>
<p>There are some understandable concerns about the practice. Seeking to address the issue oneself may cause a delay in seeking treatment for PND or other post-natal problems and there is a small concern about potential infection risk if the process is not sterile. A <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/birt.12354">large medical records study in the USA</a> found no evidence of adverse outcomes associated with the practice, which is reassuring, but may not be applicable to other countries where methods may vary subtly or significantly. When it is brought up in clinical practice, healthcare professionals should be able to non-judgmentally and openly discuss with pregnant people the available medical evidence, or lack thereof, for placentophagy. They should also explore the reasons why someone might be considering it and if there is any additional support they want or need.</p>

<p><i>By</i> <a href="https://emmayoung.net/">Emma Young</a></p>
<p>Love it or loathe it, <em>Forrest Gump</em> has now gone way beyond introducing “Life is like a box of chocolates” and “Run, Forrest! Run!” into our vernacular. It’s been used to do something truly remarkable: to reveal the location of a map of emotions in the human brain.</p>
<p>This <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-019-13599-z">new work</a>, published in <em>Nature Communications</em>, shows that a spherical bit of cortex, about three centimetres in diameter, represents not only the kind of emotion we’re feeling in any given moment, but how strongly we’re feeling it. In revealing objective brain-based correlates of our feelings, the work potentially has all kinds of implications for psychiatry.<span id="more-39296"></span></p>
<p>Giada Lettieri at the IMT School for Advanced Studies in Lucca, Italy, and colleagues recruited 12 participants to watch an edited version of the movie. Throughout, they each reported on their feelings of happiness, sadness, anger, fear, surprise and disgust, providing intensity ratings on a scale from 1 to 100.</p>
<p>The team averaged out these ratings across participants during different scenes, to get an overall picture of how emotions changed throughout the movie. But as well as conceptualising emotions as discrete feelings like happiness or anger, the team also examined three measures that together could also account for how participants were feeling. The first was a measure of polarity — the positivity, or negativity, of the viewers’ emotional state at any given point in the film. The second was a measure of complexity — of feeling mixed, vs single, emotions. The final measure was of emotional intensity.</p>
<p>The team then compared this data with brain scans made using fMRI of 15 other people while they had watched the same film. This fMRI work had been done earlier by another team in Germany, who had made their data openly available for use by other researchers.</p>
<p>The results revealed that the emotional ratings across the course of the movie were related to specific patterns of activity in a small region of the right temporo-parietal cortex.  It wasn’t the case, though, that “happiness” was represented in one discrete part, and “anger” in another, say.</p>
<p>Instead, different “gradients” of neuronal activity in this region represented emotional polarity, complexity, and intensity. The three overlapping gradients in different orientations “allows a gamut of emotional experiences to be represented in a single patch of cortex”, the researchers note.</p>
<p>They call this process “emotionotopy” and add that its organisation is similar to the way certain properties of visual information (such as the distance of a stimulus image from the fovea and the stimulus’s location in the visual field) are mapped in the primary visual cortex.</p>
<p>Overall, the work certainly does suggest that this bit of cortex is responsible for mapping what we’re feeling in a given moment, and how strongly we’re feeling it. And this, at least, seems to be common to all people. “In the current study, ratings of the emotional experience elicited by an American movie in Italian participants explained brain activity in German subjects,” note Lettieri and her colleagues. “This suggests that the topographic representation of emotion dimensions exists regardless of linguistic or micro-cultural differences.”</p>
<p>More movies should now be used to test the generalizability of the results, they add. If the findings do hold up, an understanding of how emotions and their intensity are represented in the brain might in theory help with research into disorders of emotion, such as depression and phobias. “These studies are getting psychiatry closer to other fields of medicine in finding objective biological correlates of feelings, which are subjective states,” comments study co-author Pietro Pietrini.</p>

<p>Across a series of seven studies, at team led by Steven O Roberts at Stanford University found that the way that we perceive God — and in particular our beliefs about God’s race — may influence our decisions about who should be in positions of leadership more generally.<span id="more-39291"></span></p>
<p>First, the team examined how 444 American Christians — a mixture of men and women, some black and some white — pictured God. In their “indirect” measure, the researchers asked participants to view 12 pairs of faces that differed either in age (young vs old), race (white vs black), or gender (man vs woman), and pick the photo of each pair they thought looked more like God. Participants were also asked to explicitly rate God on each of these characteristics (e.g. whether they thought God was more likely white or black).</p>
<p>On both measures, participants were more likely to see God as old than young, and male rather than female. But participants’ view of God’s race depended on their own race: white participants tended to see God as white, while black participants tended to see God as black.</p>
<p>So people clearly conceptualise God in a specific way — but how does this relate to decisions they make in their everyday lives? For Christians, God is the ultimate leader, so perhaps they look for the characteristics they ascribe to God in other leaders too. So in a second study, the team asked more than 1,000 participants to complete the same direct and indirect measures as before, as well as a new task in which they imagined working for a company that was looking for a new supervisor. They saw 32 faces that varied in gender and race and had to rate how well each person would fit the position.</p>
<p>The team found that when participants saw God as white, they tended to give white candidates a higher rating compared to black candidates. The reverse was true too: participants who saw God as black tended to rate black candidates as more suited than white ones. People who saw God as male also rated males higher than females. A subsequent study found that even children aged 4 to 12 generally perceived God as male and white, and those who conceptualised God as white also viewed white people as more boss-like than black people.</p>
<p>The results suggest that the extent to which people see God as white and male predicts how much they will prefer white men for leadership roles. Interestingly, these effects held even after controlling for measures of participants’ racial prejudice, sexism and political attitudes, suggesting that the effects couldn’t simply be explained by these kinds of biases. Of course, when people saw God as black, these effects were reversed, with participants preferring black candidates. But the fact is that in America, the idea that God is white is a “deeply rooted intuition”, the authors write, and so this conceptualisation could potentially reinforce existing hierarchies that disadvantage black people.</p>
<p>However, there’s a big limitation here: these studies were all based on <em>correlations</em> between beliefs about God and beliefs about who should be leaders. That is, it wasn’t clear whether perceptions of God’s race actually <em>cause</em> people to prefer certain leaders or whether there’s something else going on that could explain the link between the two.</p>
<p>To address this question of causality, the team turned to made-up scenarios, in which participants had to judge who made good rulers based on the characteristics of a deity. Participants read about a planet inhabited by different kinds of aliens — “Hibbles” or “Glerks” — who all worshipped a Creator. People tended to infer whether Hibbles or Glerks should rule over the planet depending on whether the Creator itself was Hibble or Glerk.</p>
<p>These final studies provide some evidence that the ways in which people picture God, or at least an abstract God-like being, do indeed filter down to actively influence beliefs and decisions in other areas of their lives. The authors suggest that future work should look at how to prevent people making these kinds of inferences.</p>
<p>Of course, the research focuses on a specific group: all participants lived in America, and in most studies they were Christian (some of the later studies also included atheists). It remains to be seen whether similar patterns exist amongst adherents of other religions, or in countries with different demographics. It would also be important to figure out whether perceptions of God influence decisions in the real world, and not just in the lab.</p>
<p>Still, as the authors write, the results “provide robust support for a profound conclusion: beliefs about who rules in heaven predict beliefs about who rules on earth.”</p>

                <h4><a href="https://xcorr.net/2020/03/04/rewriting-matlab-code-in-python/">Rewriting Matlab code in Python</a></h4>

<div class="wp-block-group"><div class="wp-block-group__inner-container">
<div class="wp-block-jetpack-markdown"><p>So you’re beginning to use Python daily. Great! You might still have a critical set of Matlab scripts from back in the day that doesn’t have a neat equivalent in Python. How do you rewrite this code in Python without introducing many headaches? I’ve had to do this a handful of times and have developed a method based on test-driven development that avoids the biggest issues in code translation:</p>
<ol>
<li>Define what you want to translate</li>
<li>Create a test plan based on existing code</li>
<li>Write tests in Python</li>
<li>Write the code in Python</li>
<li>Iterate until tests pass</li>
</ol>
<p>To test the method, I’ve migrated a script that I found in <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19709635">Susillo and Abbott (2009)</a>. It simulates a chaotic neural network and trains it with recursive least-squares. I wanted to make sure I would run into issues (gotchas!) when I translated the code to exercise the method – and I did run into issues! The method I’m outlining highlighted the translation bugs early and helped squash them.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This is part 3 of my guide on transitioning from Matlab to Python. Read <a href="https://xcorr.net/2020/02/21/transitioning-away-from-matlab/">part 1: a curriculum to learn Python</a> and <a href="https://xcorr.net/2020/02/29/orienting-yourself-through-python/">part 2: choosing environments, IDEs and packages</a>.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>Pick your battles</h3>
<p>Algorithmic code that does matrix manipulation is typically a good candidate for translation into Python. Importantly, the code you will translate needs to currently run in Matlab, since we’re going to have to run the code and capture its current behaviour. <a href="https://realpython.com/build-python-c-extension-module/">Mex code can be repurposed pretty straightforwardly into a Python extension</a>, keeping the core C numerics intact.</p>
<p>Try to avoid direct translation of code with dependencies on Simulink, GUIDE, or esoteric toolboxes. For GUIDE in particular, I’ve found that the limitations of GUIDE enforce a certain style of coding – lots of globals and convoluted logic. You’re probably better off rewriting the GUI code from scratch than attempting direct translation.</p>
<p>Not every piece of Matlab code needs to be translated to Python. If your goal is to archive an existing pipeline so it continues to run despite deprecation, <a href="https://github.com/mathworks-ref-arch/matlab-dockerfile">containerizing Matlab with Docker</a> is a good route. You can also call legacy Matlab code from Python directly using the official Matlab engine for Python from Mathworks or using shell calls. However, some situations will <em>require</em> translating Matlab code, for instance, if you want to run your code in the cloud.</p>
<p>Finally, consider doing the process for a smaller project first. It’s not that easy! You will learn a lot from doing this once on a smaller scale. I recommend that you <a href="https://swcarpentry.github.io/git-novice/">create a git repo for your project and commit regularly</a>, because you might be doing a lot of iterations to get everything to run correctly.</p>
<h3>Creating a test-based strategy for rewriting the code</h3>
<p>We’ve identified a good script or function to rewrite. Should we start writing Python? No! It is very easy to rewrite code in another language that <em>seems</em> to work, but has subtle bugs. You can spend days or weeks chasing down these bugs, and it will drive you crazy! For this reason, we will use a test-based strategy:</p>
<ol>
<li>Capture what the behaviour of the code is <em>right now</em> for a variety of inputs.</li>
<li>Rewrite the code in Python and make sure it does exactly the thing that we want it to do. That is, for the same inputs, it gives us the same outputs.</li>
</ol>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unit_testing">We will create unit tests to verify the behaviour of our code is correct</a>, meaning that it matches the old code exactly. At this point, you may say – <em>hold on, I don’t just want to transfer the code over, I want to improve it</em>! Our goal is to capture the logic part of the code – the number-crunching. This does not stop us from improving the reference code in a number of ways, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Making constants changeable</li>
<li>Making the code more modular</li>
<li>Using Pythonic data structures, for example using <code>pandas</code> to store time series.</li>
</ul>
<p>In any case, we have to build on a solid foundation – a reference. Once we replicate the original behaviour and commit it to a repo, we can improve it later in a new commit.</p>
<h3>Identify inputs and outputs</h3>
<p>We need to identify the inputs and outputs of the script or function we want to rewrite. One very nice thing about Matlab is that functions tend to be stateless and do not modify their arguments (unless an input is a reference object type, which is pretty rare). Thus, we can reason pretty easily about the inputs and the outputs to a function:</p>
<ul>
<li>The inputs are the arguments.</li>
<li>The outputs are the return variables.</li>
</ul>
<p>Functions may have side-effects, such as creating a plot or saving a file. A side-effect to a function is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Side_effect_(computer_science)">an observable effect besides returning a value (the main effect) to the invoker of the operation</a>. If the code you’re translating has side-effects, you should aim to remove them.</p>
<p>For example, consider a function takes in data and returns nothing, saving the results to disk, like so:</p>
<pre><code class="language-matlab">function [] = mycomplexop(outfile)
    data = zeros(100, 100);
    % Complex things happen in the middle...
    save(outfile, 'data');
end
</code></pre>
<p>You can transform this into a side-effect-free function by returning the results instead of saving them:</p>
<pre><code class="language-matlab">function [data] = mycomplexop()
    data = zeros(100, 100);
    % Complex things happen in the middle...
    return
end
</code></pre>
<p>I prefer to comment out plotting code rather than trying to replicate it exactly. Again, we want to focus on the number crunching.</p>
<h3>Identify test cases</h3>
<p>Many Matlab scripts are written in a style where the inputs to a function are set up, a function or set of functions are called, and then the output is plotted. We need to capture the inputs to this set of functions as well as the inputs. An easy way to do this is using <code>save</code>:</p>
<pre><code class="language-matlab">% Set up the inputs.
t = 0:1000;
dt = .1;
g = 10;

save inputs.mat -hdf5

% Call the function
complexoutput = mycomplexfun(t, dt, g);

save outputs.mat -hdf5

% Plotting the output
plot(t, complexoutput);
</code></pre>
<p>I used Octave here – but you can use <code>-v7.3</code> rather than <code>-hdfd5</code> to save if you’re using Matlab. <code>mat</code> files saved in these formats are actually hdf5 files that Python can read.</p>
<p>Pay special attention to randomization. It will be hard to replicate Matlab’s random number generation exactly in Python. Ideally, functions should be independent of randomizations, because functions with random outputs are very hard to test for correctness. If a function requires random variables to implement an algorithm, we can circumvent this issue by giving the function the random data it needs. For example, let’s say we have a function that computes the distribution of the range of a random normal variable:</p>
<pre><code class="language-matlab">function [dist] = rangedist()
    A = randn(100, 1000);
    dist = max(A, 1) - min(A, 1);
end
</code></pre>
<p>We can rewrite this function so that its source of randomness comes from outside the function:</p>
<pre><code class="language-matlab">function [dist] = rangedist(A)
    dist = max(A, 1) - min(A, 1);
end
</code></pre>
<p>Then we can generate the <code>A</code> variable in a script, and save that particular random draw.</p>
<p>Make sure to pick test cases that won’t take more than a few seconds to run. You will be running your tests many times, and these seconds will add up! Toy data is fine. It’s also good practice to test our code on simple inputs where the correct output is clear, for example, all zeros, all ones, etc. Save as many input-output pairs as is necessary to capture the range of behaviours of functions you want to capture.</p>
<p>In addition to testing our script end-to-end, we may choose to test intermediate computations involved in the script. Testing more fine-grained computations will help you debug your code. If your function is already written as a function, it may call private functions – which can make things a bit tricky. You may need to refactor a bit of the Matlab code to make private functions public so that you can capture both their inputs and outputs.</p>
<h3>Writing a test scaffold</h3>
<p>Unit testing checks whether the results of a function are as expected given a set of inputs. Testing in Python can range from using simple inline <code>assert</code> statements to sophisticated automated solutions that check that tests pass every time you push code into your repo. In our case, we will use a lightweight manual testing method: hiding test cases behind <code>__name__ == '__main__'</code>.</p>
<p>We will create a python module that is meant to be imported, for example, via <code>import mymodule</code>. When we run the file on the command line, however, via <code>python module.py</code>, the code hidden behind this <code>if</code> statement will be run:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">import numpy as np

def my_complex_fun(A):
    # Complicated things occur.
    return A * 2

def _run_tests():
    # Load inputs.
    with h5py.File('inputs.mat', 'r') as f:
        A = np.array(f['A/value'])

    with h5py.File('outputs.mat', 'r') as f:
        B_ref = np.array(f['B/value'])

    # Call the function.
    B = my_complex_fun(A)

    # Check shapes are good.
    assert A.shape == B.shape

    # Check values are similar.
    np.testing.assert_all_close(B, B_ref)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    # Run the tests.
    _run_tests()
</code></pre>
<p>The tests are inside the <code>_run_tests()</code> function. This way, the module namespace will not be polluted with variables that could have the same name as other variables inside of a function.</p>
<p>When the code is run, the tests should raise errors if the output is not as expected, which will stop execution. You will see a big old error on the command line, and then you know that you must correct the code. You can raise an error by:</p>
<ul>
<li>Using the <code>assert</code> statement. It raises an error whenever the statement is False.</li>
<li>Using the methods in <a href="https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/reference/routines.testing.html"><code>np.testing</code></a>. These methods can check whether, for example, the elements of numpy array are all close to a reference (within numeric error).</li>
<li>Using the <code>raise</code> statement to manually raise an error.</li>
</ul>
<p>That’s really all you need to test code. <a href="https://realpython.com/python-testing/">Numerous unit-testing libraries in Python exist</a>, but at their core is the same idea: create code that raises an error when the output not what is expected.</p>
<h3>Picking organization</h3>
<p>Main effects are much easier to test than side effects in the unit-testing framework. You’ll often find yourself writing side-effect-free, modular and functional code for this reason. That’s great! You’ll tend to create smaller functions so that you can test each individual component. Your code will be easier to reason about.</p>
<p>The Python code you write may be objected-oriented. Although Matlab now has excellent support for classes, much Matlab code, especially older code, eschews the use of classes. If you don’t feel comfortable writing object-oriented code, don’t sweat it – Python code doesn’t have to use classes to be Pythonic. Classes make sense when something needs to remember and manage its own state. <a href="https://realpython.com/python3-object-oriented-programming/">Here’s a tutorial on Python classes if it’s something that intrigues you</a>.</p>
<h3>Writing the code – common gotchas</h3>
<p>Now that we’ve picked our tests, and picked how we’ll organize our code, we can start coding. Matlab’s matrix operations naturally translate to Numpy. Be careful with these common gotchas:</p>
<ul>
<li>Reshape operations will cause you headaches. Matlab uses Fortran order, Python uses C by default. This means in Matlab:</li>
</ul>
<pre><code class="language-matlab">A = [1, 2, 3; 4, 5, 6]
A(:)

ans = 
    [1, 4, 2, 5, 3, 6]
</code></pre>
<p>Whereas in Python:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">&gt;&gt;&gt; A = np.array([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]])
&gt;&gt;&gt; print(A.ravel())
[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
</code></pre>
<ul>
<li>Saving to hdf5 in Matlab and loading in Python will invert axes because of the distinction between C and Fortran order. You will have to swap axes front to back, for example. For example, if you save a three-dimensional tensor in Matlab <code>A</code> and then load it back in Python via hdf5, you will need to call <code>A.swapaxes((2, 1, 0))</code> to get back the original tensor.</li>
<li>Be careful with dimension-one vectors! If you have a one-dimension vector <code>a</code> of shape <code>(N, )</code>, then <code>a.dot(a.T)</code> gives you a vector of the shape <code>(N, )</code>. It will not be a scalar, nor a matrix. If you wanted to computed the outer product of <code>a</code> with itself, use <code>a.reshape((-1, 1)).dot(a.reshape((1, -1)))</code> or better yet <code>np.outer(a, a)</code>.</li>
<li>Hidden dot products can cause problems! The <code>*</code> operator applies to scalars and to vectors in Matlab, and the semantics are different depending on the dimension of the operands. <code>A.dot(B)</code> replace Matlab’s <code>A * B</code>. <a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0465/">You may also see <code>A @ B</code> being used but it’s still rather esoteric</a>. * Objects in Python have pass-by-reference semantics. Several methods in numpy modify data in place. Be careful! Sometimes, you will explicitly need to <code>copy()</code> your data.</li>
<li>Python uses 0-based indices and Matlab 1-based indices. Watch out!</li>
<li>Look at your data! Don’t fly blind!</li>
</ul>
<p>If you write a piece of code that you suspect may cause a bug, you can use inline <code>assert</code> statements to make sure it works. I like to use this to check the dimensions of intermediate arrays, for example.</p>
<p>Some of the problems of direct index manipulation can go away by using <code>pandas</code> dataframes where appropriate. <a href="http://xarray.pydata.org/en/stable/"><code>xarray</code></a> uses named dimensions for tensors, which can help avoid many mistakes caused by the need for swapping axes and reshaping. <a href="https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/reference/generated/numpy.einsum.html"><code>np.einsum</code></a> can express complicated sums and products of tensors in an easy-to-read, less error-prone manner.</p>
<p>You might want to consider translating parts of your numerics to <a href="https://pytorch.org/">PyTorch</a> or <a href="https://www.tensorflow.org/">Tensorflow</a> directly, especially if you want to take advantage of automatic differentiation. Performance-sensitive code can be JIT’ed using <a href="https://github.com/google/jax">jax</a> or <a href="https://numba.pydata.org/">numba</a>, or rewritten in <a href="https://cython.org/">Cython</a>. Start small and optimize as necessary.</p>
<h3>Using the method on a real script</h3>
<p><a href="https://github.com/patrickmineault/test-driven-migration/original_force_external_feedback_loop.m">The example script I rewrote is about 165 lines of code</a>. It’s written in a pedagogic style and intersperses explanations, logic and plotting. In that sense, it’s similar to a jupyter notebook. I focused on transferring the logic of the main loop, which does a forward simulation of the network and trains it with the FORCE algorithm.</p>
<p>I had to change a handful of things related to plotting to get it to run in Octave, but I was able to get it to run within about 10 minutes. Not bad for 10-year code! The code is organized in this way:</p>
<ul>
<li>sets up variables.</li>
<li>runs the body of the computation (a big <code>for</code> loop). This body has side effects (plotting).</li>
<li>finishes in an end state that contains the results of the computation.</li>
</ul>
<p>Although the code is not set up as a function, it was fairly easy to isolate the inputs are – they’re what the <code>for</code> loop needs to get started:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>x0</code>, <code>z0</code>, <code>wf</code>, <code>dt</code>, <code>M</code>, <code>N</code>, <code>ft</code></li>
</ul>
<p>And the outputs are the variables computed in the main for loop, namely:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>zt</code> and <code>w0_len</code></li>
</ul>
<p>I captured these inputs and outputs as a test case for my script. I commented out the forward simulation of the trained network that comes after the main for loop since it’s another logically separate component of the code that I could attack later.</p>
<p>In addition to the end-to-end result of the script, I captured the result of the first iteration of forwarding the network state, to create a more granular test. I also checked array dimensions.</p>
<p>I decided to write the code as a class, with methods <code>train</code> and <code>simulate</code>. <a href="https://github.com/patrickmineault/test-driven-migration/blob/master/chaotic_rnn.py">The resulting code doesn’t look like Matlab code</a>. Yet, because I’d set up a test scaffold, I could be assured that it works the same as the old Matlab code.</p>
<p>Translation was hard! I ran into multiple very subtle issues translating the rather short code I was working (maybe 20 lines of real logic). The issues were subtle – incorrect manipulation of dimension-1 vectors, off-by-1 errors in a loop. Having reference code and functional tests allowed me to isolate these issues, fix them, and replicate the original functionality exactly. It took about 3 hours, which is a lot! I was very careful to set up a well-defined goalpost when I translated the code, so I knew when I would be done, which kept me going.</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/patrickmineault/test-driven-migration/blob/master/chaotic_rnn.py">The translated code is available here</a>. <a href="https://github.com/patrickmineault/test-driven-migration/blob/master/Use%20chaotic%20RNN.ipynb">I imported the code into a notebook and generated some figures from it</a> – it runs!</p>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>Using test-driven development, it’s possible to systematically, incrementally transfer legacy Matlab code to the Python environment. You can be assured that the code will <em>work</em> in the end because you will have defined what <em>working</em> means. You will have created a test suite for your code with good coverage for your new Python code. You might even have spotted subtle bugs in the original Matlab code along the way! Future you will thank you for your attention to detail.</p>

<p class="BodyA"><span lang="EN-US">Introduce a single man to a single woman and the odds are that he will over-estimate how sexually interested she is in him, while she will under-estimate his sexual interest in her. This <span class="Hyperlink0"><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22261567"><span style="color: black;">sex difference in misperceptions</span></a></span><span class="None"> has been found by researchers time and again. The conventional explanation is that these are evolved adaptions — that’s it’s more evolutionarily costly for a man to miss a chance to mate with an interested partner than it is for a woman, and more costly for a woman to engage in sex with an uncommitted man than vice versa. But now a </span><span class="Hyperlink0"><a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0956797619900315"><span style="color: black;">new study</span></a></span><span class="None">, published in <i>Psychological Science</i>, challenges this notion, and provides some alternative explanations.</span></span></p>
<p><span id="more-39281"></span></p>
<p>A team led by Anthony J Lee at the University of Stirling recruited 586 male and 640 female students for a set of speed-dating experiments, each of which typically involved three to four men and three to four women. All the participants identified as heterosexual and none were in a committed relationship. After rating their own attractiveness (using a measure that included personality as well as physical attractiveness), they embarked on a series of three-minute-long “dates” with each opposite-sex member of their group.</p>
<p>After each date, the participants rated their sexual interest in their partner and also their perceptions of their partner’s sexual interest in them. At the end of the session, they completed a questionnaire that assessed their “sociosexual orientation” — essentially, the extent to which they were willing to engage in uncommitted sex.</p>
<p><span>In total, the researchers gathered data on 3,850 interactions. Their analysis showed that both the men and women had some insight into their partners’ level of sexual interest in them. However, this was far from perfect, and, consistent with earlier studies, overall, the men over-perceived their partners’ interest, while the women under-perceived it.</span></p>
<p>Next, the researchers explored what might account for this sex difference. Two factors — both of which were linked more to the men than the women — stood out as being associated with over-perceptions of sexual interest. The first was having a short-term mating strategy (having a positive attitude towards uncommitted sex). The second was a participant’s own levels of sexual interest in their partner: the more interested they were, the more interested they thought the other person was in them. In these cases, it seems, the participants were projecting their own interest onto their date. And when the researchers accounted for these two factors in their analysis, the sex differences disappeared.</p>
<p>“Collectively, these findings suggest that the sex difference in misperceptions can be explained by a combination of a. men scoring higher than women on sociosexual orientation… and b. men being more interested in their partners,” the researchers write.</p>
<p>The first factor — being motivated to engage in uncommitted sex — might have been evolutionarily encouraged more in men than in women. However, statistically-speaking, the second factor was much more important in explaining the sex differences in misperceptions. And the researchers do not believe that projection of sexual interest is likely to be a specialised male adaptation for boosting their reproductive success. Perhaps, they suggest, it might rather reflect a tendency for individuals to assume that other people think the same way that they do. If this interpretation is right, then men seem to be more susceptible to this than women.</p>
<p>Overall, they conclude: “Previous theories for the purported sex differences in misperceptions of sexual interest emphasize that men and women have evolved different psychologies because of sex-specific selection pressures. Our findings challenge this popular notion.”</p>

<img alt="" class="attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image" height="110" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2020/02/19954646-140x110.jpg" style="display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;" width="140" /><p>As people grow older, they may experience changes in their memory, like forgetting an appointment or someone’s name, leading to concerns about their memory functioning. And older adults sometimes report having memory problems despite performing normally on memory tests, such as those conducted by their doctor. Even if cognitive testing is normal, <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24363073">subjective memory complaints</a> are important to consider as they might be an early indicator of more serious problems with memory and <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17623488">cognition</a> or psychological stress such as depression or anxiety. Older adults can have <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23215819">memory complaints</a> as well as <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26880907">typical symptoms of depression</a>, making it difficult for healthcare providers to determine how these symptoms are related. It is unclear from the current research whether, in older adults with both depressive symptoms and memory complaints, depressive symptoms lead to problems with memory or whether the perception of memory problems contributes to the development of depressive symptoms.</p>
<p>To better understand the order in which memory complaints and depressive symptoms occur, we need to see how these two symptoms develop within an individual over time. In <a href="https://bmcgeriatr.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12877-020-1451-1?utm_source=bmc_blogs&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=null&amp;utm_campaign=blog_2020_bmcseriesblog">our new study</a>, published in <a href="https://bmcgeriatr.biomedcentral.com/?utm_source=bmc_blogs&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=null&amp;utm_campaign=blog_2020_bmcseriesblog"><em>BMC Geriatrics</em></a>, we examine the development of depressive symptoms and memory complaints in two large groups of older adults across periods of 6-18 years.</p>
<h3><strong>What we did</strong></h3>
<blockquote><p>Perceiving that their memory is getting worse may lead an older adult to experience symptoms of depression.</p></blockquote>
<p>We used two large, publicly available datasets that together represented over 10,000 older adults from across the United States. These longitudinal datasets included measures of memory complaints and depressive symptoms, collected via interviews conducted every year or every other year for up to 18 years. Any older adult experiencing clinically significant changes in their cognition was removed from our study. This is important because individuals with cognitive impairment may not report memory complaints due to a lack of awareness of their memory problems.</p>
<p>Older adults reported their perceptions of their memory in two questions, one for current memory rating and one for memory decline over the past year or two years. The first question asked for a rating of their memory at the present time. A second question then asked whether they perceived their memory to be better, worse, or the same as it was the last time they were interviewed. For depressive symptoms, older adults indicated whether they had recently experienced a range of symptoms e.g., felt down, depressed or hopeless. We controlled for other personal characteristics that might influence depressive symptoms and/or memory complaints such as sex, education level, age, race/ethnicity, income, and marital status.</p>
<h3><strong>What we found</strong></h3>
<p>We first examined whether memory complaints co-occurred with depressive symptoms. That is, at times when a person reported a memory complaint, did they report more depressive symptoms? In one of the two datasets, we found that at times when an older adult provided lower current memory ratings, they also reported more depressive symptoms. Importantly, we also found that at times when an older adult reported a decline in memory, they also reported more depressive symptoms at that same interview across both datasets.</p>
<p>We then examined whether memory complaints predicted future depressive symptoms. We found that older adults’ rating of their current memory at one interview was not related to their depressive symptoms at the next interview. However, when an older adult reported a decline in memory at one interview, they reported more symptoms of depression at the next interview across both datasets. Interestingly, this was not true in the other direction: current symptoms of depression did not predict future memory complaints.</p>
<h3><strong>What it means</strong></h3>
<blockquote><p>Helping older adults understand normal changes in memory could prevent increases in depressive symptoms.</p></blockquote>
<p>Memory complaints are often seen as a symptom of depression in older adults; however, our work suggests that this is not the case for all types of memory complaints. Older adults’ low rating of their memory performance can be related to depressive symptoms, but is not always. In contrast, older adults’ feeling of their memory getting worse over longer periods of time (e.g., a year or two) is consistently related to their current feelings of sadness and hopelessness as well as to increases in future depressive symptoms. Therefore, perceiving that their memory is getting worse may lead an older adult to experience symptoms of depression. This may be because when an older adult feels like their memory is getting worse, they start to experience sadness or hopelessness about their memory, and what it means to grow older in general. Alternatively, for some older adults, perceiving that their memory is getting worse could also trigger fears about dementia or other aging-related disorders. It likely depends on the individual and their different experiences with aging and memory.</p>
<h3><strong>Clinical implications</strong></h3>
<p>Health care professionals working with older adults should consider asking them about how their memory is changing over time. These types of questions are necessary to understand how an older adult is currently feeling, but are also important for how they may be feeling at future appointments. This suggests that helping older adults understand normal changes in memory could prevent increases in depressive symptoms and promote better psychological health and well-being.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://xcorr.net/2020/02/29/orienting-yourself-through-python/">Orienting yourself through Python</a></h4>

<p>I was surprised by the amount of positive response to my <a href="https://xcorr.net/2020/02/21/transitioning-away-from-matlab/">last article on transitioning away from Matlab</a>. Many people are ready to switch – but they’re facing some significant challenges. One of the biggest things I’ve heard beginners say is that they are overwhelmed with the number of choices they have to make with Python. Python is open-source, has a decentralized contribution model, and has been around for more than 25 years. For everything that you can do one way in Matlab, there are at least 10 different ways of doing it in Python. Picking the best one is stressful!</p>



<div class="wp-block-group"><div class="wp-block-group__inner-container">
<div class="wp-block-jetpack-markdown"><p>This is my rough guide to orienting yourself with Python. Don’t read it all in one go, it will make your head spin! The goal is not to overwhelm you with information, but to have this information as a reference when you’re ready to use it. The recommendations are based on my personal opinions and experiences. They’re written with the intent of minimizing the amount of research and pain you’ll have to go through as a beginner. Don’t agree? Post in the comments! Feedback is a gift.</p>

<h4>Which distribution should I choose?</h4>
<p>The Python distribution on the python.org website <em>does not</em> include a lot of core packages needed for data science. It also does not include a package manager. A package manager allows you to automatically download and install a set of scripts and modules of a specific version – a package. People recommend using <a href="https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/">the Anaconda distribution</a>, which is more fully-featured. It includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Python.</li>
<li><code>ipython</code>, the interactive python console.</li>
<li>The <code>conda</code> package manager. Note that conda and the Anaconda distribution are two different (though similarly named) things.</li>
<li>Many of the core packages needed for data science.</li>
<li>An installer that sets your path correctly, which is especially important on Windows.</li>
</ul>
<p>You should pick the <a href="https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/">latest stable version of Python 3 that conda comes in, in its 64-bit incarnation</a>. Python 2 has been deprecated for several years, and you should not be using it.</p>
<h4>Which package manager should I use?</h4>
<p>When you try to install packages like <code>tensorflow</code> and <code>pytorch</code>, you’ll quickly find that there are often two ways to install the same thing:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>pip</code>: the lightweight package manager. Originally pip could only install Python packages, but these days it can install non-Python system-wide dependencies to Python packages.</li>
<li><code>conda</code>: the heavy-duty package manager. It’s not just for Python, it’s for everything! This includes Python packages with weird dependencies, R and Julia packages, text editors, etc.</li>
</ul>
<p>Generally, packages will tell you how you should install them. Just follow the instructions. In either program manager, the process is similar: open the command line, type in a command, for example:</p>
<pre><code>pip install pytorch
</code></pre>
<p>or:</p>
<p><code>conda install pytorch</code></p>
<p>Then confirm, and wait for the install to finish. No need to set the path or anything. Generally, I find that conda is slower but it can install a wider range of things.</p>
<h4>Where should I install my packages?</h4>
<p>When you install a package in Python, you can either install it in the base (or root) environment or in a custom environment.</p>
<p>&gt; A virtual environment is a named, isolated, working copy of Python that that maintains its own files, directories, and paths so that you can work with specific versions of libraries or Python itself without affecting other Python projects.</p>
<p>If you’re coming from the Matlab world, you know all the annoyances that come with managing the path. Imagine removing the path and replacing it wholesale when you switch projects. That’s sort of what environments do in Python. Another metaphor you might like is a virtual machine or a container. It’s a little sandbox in which you can put packages. If you bonk your environment, you delete it and create a new one. No need to reinstall your computer!</p>
<p>There are a few different environment managers, but since you installed Anaconda (above) and you have <code>conda</code> installed, you want to use <code>conda</code> environments. When you get started, you can put everything in the <code>base</code> environment. Later on, you’ll find this limiting (maybe you’ll have messed up your install with incompatible dependencies after a bit), so you’ll create another environment, perhaps called <code>py3</code>. Later still, you might start creating one environment per project (with its own Github repo!).</p>
<p>Packages that have very specific sets of dependencies will sometimes ask you to recreate an environment <em>exactly</em>. In that case, follow the instructions to the letter; the package probably needs an old version of a package or has esoteric system-wide dependencies that you will waste hours trying to track down. <a href="https://github.com/AlexEMG/DeepLabCut/blob/master/conda-environments/README.md">One package that requires this is DeepLabCut</a>.</p>
<h4>Which packages should I install?</h4>
<p>Many of the packages included by default in anaconda are your standard bread-and-butter for data science, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>matplotlib for plotting</li>
<li>numpy for matrices</li>
<li>scipy for signal processing</li>
<li>pandas for dataframes</li>
<li>sklearn for machine learning</li>
</ul>
<p>Each of these packages has millions of users, they are very active and they’re supported by grants and commercial entities. You can rely on them. I also list <a href="https://xcorr.net/2020/02/21/transitioning-away-from-matlab/">well-supported packages for neuroscience</a> in the previous article.</p>
<p>What about more esoteric needs? How do I intuit whether I’m going to waste a bunch of time on a package that doesn’t work? Here are a few heuristics:</p>

<div class="wp-block-jetpack-markdown"><ul>
<li>How many stars does it have on Github (1 in the above picture)? If it has 1k+ stars, it’s a very well-used project. If it’s smaller than 100 – beware.</li>
<li>When is the last commit on Github (2 in the above picture)? If it’s more than a year, chances are the package is abandoned. This may make it difficult to install.</li>
<li>When in doubt, ask! Ask your labmates, on Twitter, on your favorite Discourse or at a local meetup. Use whatever everybody else is using – this way, it will be easier to get support.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Which IDE should I use?</h4>
<p>There are two categories of integrated development environment for Python:</p>
<ol>
<li>Code editors. You edit code that you can run from inside the editor. Code editors will have a file explorer, variables explorer, a plotting window, a console window, a graphical debugger, etc. These programs can approximate more or less faithfully the experience you have with Matlab. In some cases, they offer many, many more features. They run as standalone programs on your computer.</li>
<li>Notebook editors. You edit a visual document consisting of cells that can be run in any arbitrary order. Plots are saved inline and code can be interspersed with formatted text and formulas. Notebooks run inside in your browser and can connect to remote workers (Python doesn’t have to be on your computer, it can be in the cloud).</li>
</ol>
<p>I asked on Twitter what people tend to use, and it’s fairly evenly split. Many commented that they use both code editors and notebook editors in their day-to-day work. If I want to train a deep neural net for example, I might:</p>
<ol>
<li>Write a script in a code editor, testing it on toy data with the built-in command line</li>
<li>Run the script inside of a terminal overnight</li>
<li>Analyze the results inside of a notebook the next day.</li>
</ol>

<p><a href="https://www.datacamp.com/community/tutorials/top-python-ides-for-2019">Here is a very good article that weighs all the different options</a> – it’s long! Here is my current hot take:</p>



<ol><li>Code editors: <a href="https://www.spyder-ide.org/">Spyder is the most bare-bones IDE of the bunch, and approximates Matlab well</a>. It’s a great starter IDE. I love Atom in general but I find <a href="https://nteract.gitbooks.io/hydrogen/docs/Installation.html">Hydrogen</a>‘s lack of a console limiting. I prefer <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/">VSCode</a> with <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/languages/python">the Python extension</a>. <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/">PyCharm</a> is by far the most advanced editor, with intelligent inferences on your code and automated fixes that feel like magic. It can also be overwhelming because it has so many features, and it also isn’t free (a license is 89$ a year). If you spend 8 hours a day doing Python, PyCharm might the editor for you.</li><li>Notebook editors: <a href="https://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/en/stable/">Jupyterlab</a> does everything jupyter does and more. <a href="https://colab.research.google.com/notebooks/intro.ipynb#recent=true">Colab</a> adds sharing capabilities, and you can use a <a href="https://cloud.google.com/tpu/docs/colabs">free-tier TPU</a> with it.</li></ol>



<h4>Which GUI toolkit should I use?</h4>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="" class="wp-image-7290" data-attachment-id="7290" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-description="" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="gui-toolkits" data-large-file="https://xcorr.files.wordpress.com/2020/02/gui-toolkits.png?w=723" data-medium-file="https://xcorr.files.wordpress.com/2020/02/gui-toolkits.png?w=300" data-orig-file="https://xcorr.files.wordpress.com/2020/02/gui-toolkits.png" data-orig-size="1030,526" data-permalink="https://xcorr.net/2020/02/29/orienting-yourself-through-python/gui-toolkits/" src="https://xcorr.files.wordpress.com/2020/02/gui-toolkits.png?w=723" /></figure>



<p>I asked on Twitter recently, and it seems that many people are choosing <a href="https://wiki.python.org/moin/PyQt">PyQt5</a> to build desktop applications. Qt has a very nice builder to graphically design your GUI, as well as code generators to eliminate writing your own boilerplate. wxPython is also well-loved for larger-scale applications, while tkinter doesn’t have quite all the knobs and options you’d want for a fully-fledged app.</p>



<h4>PyTorch or Tensorflow?</h4>



<p>That’s a tough one! I’ve worked with both in a professional setting at Google and Facebook. As an end-user, <a href="https://pytorch.org/">PyTorch</a> is generally considered to be easier to use. <a href="https://tensorflow.org">Tensorflow</a> has a lot of support for advanced features, like probabilistic programming, and is used by downstream libraries for this reason, for example in the up-and-coming PyMC4. If you use Tensorflow, you probably want to start with <a href="https://keras.io/">Keras</a>, which has a higher-level API.</p>



<h4>What about plotting? How do I make nice figures?</h4>



<p><a href="https://matplotlib.org/"><code>matplotlib</code> is the package that most people start with</a>. Its API is very similar to Matlab, by design. It creates plots which are not very aesthetically pleasing, by default, but <a href="https://seaborn.pydata.org/tutorial/aesthetics.html">you can easily improve them by using seaborn’s styling</a>:</p>


<pre class="brush: plain; title: ; notranslate">import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns
sns.set()  # From now on matplotlib will use the seaborn theme.
</pre>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="" class="wp-image-7295" src="https://xcorr.files.wordpress.com/2020/02/aesthetics_7_0.png" /><img alt="" class="wp-image-7295" data-attachment-id="7295" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-description="" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="aesthetics_7_0" data-large-file="https://xcorr.files.wordpress.com/2020/02/aesthetics_7_0.png?w=370" data-medium-file="https://xcorr.files.wordpress.com/2020/02/aesthetics_7_0.png?w=300" data-orig-file="https://xcorr.files.wordpress.com/2020/02/aesthetics_7_0.png" data-orig-size="370,248" data-permalink="https://xcorr.net/2020/02/29/orienting-yourself-through-python/aesthetics_7_0/" src="https://xcorr.files.wordpress.com/2020/02/aesthetics_9_0.png" />Matplotlib plot before and after seaborn styling</figure>



<p>Many other packages build on <code>matplotlib</code>, including:</p>



<ul><li><a href="https://seaborn.pydata.org/"><code>seaborn</code></a>, which includes a number of useful plot types, including violin plots and histograms.</li><li><a href="https://github.com/has2k1/plotnine"><code>plotnine</code></a>, which implements the grammar of graphics (<code>ggplot2</code> in R).</li></ul>



<p>There are a number of up-and-coming visualization libraries that are not using matplotlib under the hood. The one with the most support behind it is <a href="https://github.com/plotly/plotly.py">plotly</a>. It creates interactive plots that can be shared easily, includes support for other languages outside of Python, and is supported commercially by the plotly company.</p>



<h3>Conclusion</h3>



<p>Picking up Python can feel overwhelming as an outsider – so many decisions to make! I was endlessly reading through articles and doing comparison shopping when I was starting out. Picking what others around you are already using will help you get support when you’re starting out. Ask around! Enjoy the ride!</p>

<p><strong>The idea that the brain operates like a computer is the latest in a long line of metaphors that scientists have used to try and understand how the organ works. But could that comparison actually be hindering our understanding? </strong>In <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/science/2020/feb/27/why-your-brain-is-not-a-computer-neuroscience-neural-networks-consciousness">a longread in <em>The Guardian</em></a>, Matthew Cobb explores the limits of the brain-as-computer metaphor.</p>

<p><strong>What does it mean to “recover” from a mental illness?</strong> Although common scales used to measure recovery can determine whether someone’s symptoms have improved, research suggests that they’re not that great at gauging more general improvement in people’s everyday lives, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/25/health/mental-health-depression-recovery.html">writes Benedict Carey</a> at <em>The New York Times</em>.</p>

<p><strong>More on the problem of AI emotion recognition this week, with a </strong><a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-00507-5"><strong>feature by Douglas Heaven</strong></a><strong> at <em>Nature</em>. </strong>Psychologists argue over whether particular emotional expressions are universal, and debate how much can be read into someone’s internal state from their face alone. But there’s one thing that many agree on: there are still big question marks around the use of automated algorithms to detect people’s emotions.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>Automated surveillance and facial recognition may also affect the way we think about ourselves. </strong>When people are observed, they see themselves “as if under a magnifying glass”, <a href="https://theconversation.com/how-cameras-in-public-spaces-might-change-how-we-think-132537">writes Janina Steinmetz</a> at <em>The Conversation</em>. People who are observed by cameras while eating feel like they have consumed larger portions, for instance, while people doing tests in front of others think they make more mistakes than unobserved test-takers. Cameras are becoming more and more common in public spaces,  Steinmetz writes,  but “we are only beginning to understand some of the psychological consequences of increased observation”.</p>

<p><strong>A new study has found that the brain processes the lyrics and the melody of songs in opposite hemispheres, </strong><a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2020/02/27/810049050/how-the-brain-teases-apart-a-songs-words-and-music?utm_medium=RSS&amp;utm_campaign=science">reports Jon Hamilton</a> for <em>NPR</em><strong>.  </strong>Researchers asked participants listen to a capella songs while having their brains scanned. Some songs were manipulated to remove frequency information, so that the melody was not recognisable but the speech remained; others were changed to remove information about the way sounds changed over time, so that the melody remained but the speech was no longer recognisable. The team found that speech was processed in the left auditory cortex and melody in the right.</p>

<p><strong>What does the replication crisis mean for psychotherapy? </strong>At <em>Aeon</em>, <a href="https://aeon.co/ideas/the-evidence-for-evidence-based-therapy-is-not-as-clear-as-we-thought">Alexander Williams and John Sakaluk argue</a> that the evidence behind many so-called “empirically supported treatments” may not be as strong as we have thought.</p>

<p><strong>Finally, when you play video games, do you invert the Y-axis? </strong>That is, when you push the stick on a controller up, do you expect your character’s head to go up or down?

<p><em>By </em><a href="http://emilyoliviareynolds.com/">Emily Reynolds</a></p>
<p>There are lots of differences between those who express opposing political affiliations — and they may not just be ideological. Liberals and conservatives have different shopping habits, for instance, with <a href="https://academic.oup.com/jcr/article/45/2/227/4827909">one series of studies</a> finding that liberals preferred products that made them feel unique, whilst conservatives picked brands that made them feel better than others. They even <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0277953619303910">view health risks differently</a> when they’re choosing what to eat.</p>
<p>But could there also be physiological differences between liberals and conservatives? Some evidence seems to suggest this might be the case, though <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2020/02/12/conservatives-might-not-have-a-more-potent-fear-response-than-liberals-after-all/">as we reported earlier this month</a> past findings, such as differences in physiological responses to fear, may not be as solid as previously thought. However, <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0956797619895284">new research</a> in <em>Psychological Science </em>has found that people of different political affiliations may differ in another way: where in the body they feel emotions relating to moral concerns.<span id="more-39227"></span></p>
<p>It’s well established that we feel particular emotions in the body — butterflies in the stomach when we’re nervous or excited, a racing pulse or flushed cheeks when we get angry. But these physical reactions are not uniform: where one person might feel disappointment in their chest, another may feel it in their stomach.</p>
<p>To examine how political ideology impacts such physiological differences, Mohammad Atari and a team from the University of Southern California asked 596 participants to read a piece of writing about a violation of a particular moral foundation. Participants were assigned to either read about a violation of morals relating to care, fairness, loyalty, authority, or purity. For example, one such vignette in the care condition read “You see a woman clearly avoiding sitting next to an obese woman on the bus” or, for the purity condition, the rather more surreal statement “You see an employee at a morgue eating a pepperoni pizza off of a dead body”.</p>
<p>Participants rated how morally wrong they felt the action described was, and also rated the strength of their emotional response. Then, presented with a map of the body, they were asked to colour in body regions they felt had become more activated (activity becoming stronger or faster) or deactivated (activity becoming weaker or slower).</p>
<p>Participants were also given a political orientation score based on how they rated their affiliation with the Republican or Democratic parties as well as their self-reported conservatism on a scale from “very liberal” to “very conservative”.</p>
<p>The results from this, and a second study aimed at replicating findings, suggest that liberals and conservatives do indeed feel moral outrage in different areas of their bodies — though in fairly concentrated areas. Liberals, for example, appeared to feel violations of “purity” in their groin area, whilst conservatives felt it in their stomach and heads; liberals were also more likely than conservatives to feel violations of “care” in their heart. This image shows the maps for each kind of moral concern:</p>

<p><span>These differences may not be as strong as they appear at first glance, however: activation was not as disparate as it might have been. Violations of “care” were felt largely in the head for both groups, “authority” in the head and chest for both, and “loyalty” in the same areas, for instance.      </span></p>
<p>The new study also comes after recent research that has seemed to debunk many claims of physiological differences between liberals and conservatives: <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2019/11/27/no-conservatives-dont-experience-feelings-of-disgust-any-more-than-liberals/">one study</a> found that conservatives don’t in fact experience any more disgust than liberals, while <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2020/02/12/conservatives-might-not-have-a-more-potent-fear-response-than-liberals-after-all/">another</a> found that physiological differences in fear response between those with different ideologies had been overstated.</p>
<p>This work doesn’t quite claim the opposite — as the authors note, “there are more commonalities than differences”. And it also relies on people’s self-reported perceptions, rather than actual measures of physiological change in the body. But those differences could be significant, and may be worth a further, closer look.</p>

What carers need and how technology can help provide it</a></h4>

<img alt="" class="attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image" height="110" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2020/02/Support_5504-140x110.jpg" style="display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;" width="140" /><p>Family carers are often invisible to the health care system in meeting the care needs of older people. Yet, family carers – people who assist a family member or friend with challenges resulting from illness, disability or aging – <a href="https://healthcouncilcanada.ca/files/HCC_HomeCare_FA.pdf">provide three-quarters of the care older adults receive</a>. Demands on family carers are <a href="https://www.utpjournals.press/doi/abs/10.3138/Q326-4625-5753-K683">increasing</a> as populations age, disability rates increase, and demands on our health and continuing care sectors escalate. In these circumstances, sustainability of family care becomes a pressing issue.</p>
<p>To better understand family caring roles, and how technology might support them, we conducted focus groups and an online survey with carers in Canada. As reported in <a href="https://bmcgeriatr.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12877-020-1455-x?utm_source=bmc_blogs&amp;amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;amp;utm_content=null&amp;amp;utm_campaign=blog_2020_bmcseriesblog">our new study</a> in <a href="https://bmcgeriatr.biomedcentral.com/?utm_source=bmc_blogs&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=null&amp;utm_campaign=blog_2020_bmcseriesblog"><em>BMC Geriatrics</em></a>, we learned that family carers want to enhance the care they currently provide, but they recognize that they have to protect their own capacity to care first.</p>
<h3><strong>Protecting family carers’ well-being</strong></h3>
<img alt="" class="size-medium wp-image-11737 alignleft" height="200" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2020/02/2_0020-300x200.jpg" width="300" />
<p>To protect their own well-being, and their ongoing capacity to provide care, family carers want to take better care of themselves, develop better coping strategies, and have opportunities for mentorship and socialization.</p>
<p>Family carers sought more time and space for themselves as part of their overall sustainability. <a href="https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/tpp/ijcc/2019/00000003/00000003/art00009">Sustainability </a>in this context refers to carers’ ability to balance the demands of caring for their loved ones without jeopardizing their own health, well-being, and quality of life. This is easier said than done as carers struggle to find a few hours to care for themselves as individuals with their own interests and needs while caring for others. Developing better coping strategies and becoming more resilient is a learned skill. Rebalancing the negative and positive aspects of caregiving, focusing on mindfulness, reducing stress, and celebrating small victories can help reframe the emotional experience of caregiving. As one carer put it,</p>
<p><em>“If caregivers had time off, their health would hopefully remain good. Currently, burnout and health implications are inevitable.”</em></p>
<p>Yet, at times, family carers feel guilty about putting their own needs first. They want <em>“better networking with other caregivers, sharing our stories to make things easier,” </em>and reducing the social isolation they often experience.</p>
<h3><strong>Enhancing family carers’ capacity to provide quality care</strong></h3>
<p>To enhance caregiving capacity, family carers want information about their care receivers’ conditions to help them plan, and the ability to navigate existing resources, programs and supports.</p>
<p>Knowing “what comes next” is a central desire for many family carers, so that they can plan for an unpredictable future, manage expectations, and make informed decisions. Having this sense of control contributes to their overall well-being. One carer wished for</p>
<p><em>“…a crystal ball so I know what the future might look like, so I can prepare more for what might be required as we go forward.”</em></p>
<p>Family carers also feel lost, navigating fragmented health and social support services without a road map. They may not know what supports and programs are available or whether they qualify for any they do know about. Making sense of the flood of online information is overwhelming in the face of family carers’ time-consuming care responsibilities. Another carer described the situation as follows:</p>
<p><em>“It is like a library with the books in a pile on the floor and no card catalogue to even let me know where to start.”</em></p>
<h3><strong>Targeted technology development can help carers achieve their goals</strong></h3>
<img alt="" class="size-medium wp-image-11738 alignright" height="199" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2020/02/Jacquie-and-Gigi-Dec04_51040-300x199.jpg" width="300" />
<p>When considering technology development to support carers, traditional problem‐focused approaches to technology design can limit discussions to performing caregiving tasks, failing to capture the relational and emotional aspects of caregiving. While technology is not the panacea that product developers and policy makers hope for, family carers did offer suggestions about how they are, or could be, using technology to enhance and preserve their caregiving capacity. Some carers use off-the-shelf technology to support their caregiving.</p>
<p><em>“My [Smart] watch tells me to breathe. It tells me to stand. Honestly. Sometimes it gets me up and I take a moment. I breathe.”</em></p>
<p>Other family carers thought of ways to modify existing technology to make it support their goals. They imagined:</p>
<ul>
<li>Private internet-based chat rooms or interactive apps for information exchange.</li>
<li>A comprehensive, searchable repository of available supports that can yield individually tailored ‘system’ navigation.</li>
<li>Advanced search engines that use artificial intelligence to organize, evaluate, synthesize and summarize large amounts of information available from the internet.</li>
<li>Smart watches that monitor blood pressure or heart rate and proactively offer calming or stress reducing activities and techniques.</li>
<li>Interactive smart phone applications, like Siri, to help carers problem-solve and find solutions to in-the-moment issues like dealing with care receivers’ challenging behaviors.</li>
<li>Networking applications or online portals to connect family carers to mentors, counselors and each other.</li>
<li>Telephone information services to point family carers to services, supports and guidance along their care journeys.</li>
<li>Systems that connect carers, providing opportunities for socialization, recreation and reducing social isolation.</li>
</ul>
<p>Of course, technology alone is not enough to sustain family care work. According to University of Birmingham social policy professor Paul Burstow, “<a href="https://www.healtheuropa.eu/benefits-technology-enabled-care/87408/">getting the balance right between ‘tech’ and ‘touch’ is vital</a>.” The insights gained from our work are an important first step in achieving this balance by understanding carers’ goals and figuring out how to support them in meaningful ways.</p>

<img alt="" class="webfeedsFeaturedVisual wp-post-image" height="150" src="https://blogs.plos.org/plos/files/2017/02/Rare-Disease-Day-Sharing-Data-150x150.jpg" style="display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;" width="150" /><p><em>Note: This blog was written by PLOS’ Iain Hrynaszkiewicz, Publisher, Open Research</em></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Open science should be boosted in 2020 as the number of journals with research data policies increases as a result of collective action by publishers, who are </span></i><a href="https://www.stm-researchdata.org/getting-started/"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">being encouraged</span></i></a><i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to adopt a </span></i><a href="http://doi.org/10.5334/dsj-2020-005"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">new common framework for journal data policies</span></i></a><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">. PLOS is the first publisher to align the policies of all its journals with this new framework</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><b>Context</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To enable reproducible research we need transparent and accessible research outputs. And, as an enabler of reproducibility, transparency is what we – journals and publishers – can reasonably ask for, or even demand. Asking for transparency can begin not with new or sophisticated technology, but with a relatively low tech solution: policy.  Introducing a policy on research data sharing is a logical first step to raising awareness of an issue and beginning to create change. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Policies have been in place for sharing some specific kinds of research data (such as protein structural data and genetic sequences) for a quarter of a century or more. Since 2014, PLOS has led the way with a </span><a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/s/data-availability"><span style="font-weight: 400;">mandatory data availability policy</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for all our articles, and since 2016 </span><a href="https://insights.uksg.org/articles/10.1629/uksg.463/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">most larger publishers</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> – Springer Nature, Elsevier, Wiley, Taylor &amp; Francis – have introduced tiered data policy initiatives. Coupled with discipline-specific policy initiatives, such as </span><a href="http://www.copdess.org/enabling-fair-data-project/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">in Earth sciences</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, this means thousands of journals now have a data policy of some kind.</span></p>
<p><b>Making a statement about data</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">An important tool, used by PLOS and others, for introducing a consistent data policy is a data availability statement in every published article. These statements indicate if, how and where the data supporting claims made in an article are available. Many journal and publisher research data policies still make data sharing and data availability statements optional rather than mandatory, but we welcome this steady progress on open research policies in the scholarly publishing community.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since mandating data sharing and data availability statements in 2014, PLOS has published more than 127,000</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">articles with a data availability statement and </span><a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194768"><span style="font-weight: 400;">more</span></a> <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.02565"><span style="font-weight: 400;">than</span></a> <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0229578"><span style="font-weight: 400;">one</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> study has analysed them. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Requiring a new section in every article published incurs costs, which at PLOS we see as a worthwhile investment in open research. It </span><a href="http://www.ijdc.net/article/view/614"><span style="font-weight: 400;">takes time</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, training and resources for editors, authors, peer reviewers and editorial office staff, so mandating these statements is understandably a consideration for other publishers of thousands of articles per year.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There is growing recognition </span><a href="https://zenodo.org/record/1476871#.XjLptGj7S72"><span style="font-weight: 400;">from funders</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, academic societies, editorial groups such as the ICMJE, that data availability statements are a practical, achievable and meaningful improvement to support transparency in research.</span></p>
<p><b>Wider adoption in 2020</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The growth rate of journal research data policies is likely to increase with the launch, in January 2020, of the STM Association’s </span><a href="https://www.stm-researchdata.org/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">STM research data year</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which has an objective to increase the number of journals with data policies and articles with data availability statements. Progress on policy implementation will be tracked across thousands of journals (STM is a publishing industry association with more than 120 organisational members). This feels like a turning point in open research policy.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The STM Association is recommending the use of a</span><a href="http://doi.org/10.5334/dsj-2020-005"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> common policy framework for journal research data policy</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to promote consistent approaches to journal research data policies, at its wide variety of members.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The policy framework – </span><a href="http://doi.org/10.5334/dsj-2020-005"><span style="font-weight: 400;">published </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">last week in a peer-reviewed journal after being </span><a href="https://figshare.com/articles/Developing_a_research_data_policy_framework_for_all_journals_and_publishers/8223365/1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">available as a preprint</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> – is an output of an initiative, begun in 2016, </span><a href="https://www.rd-alliance.org/groups/data-policy-standardisation-and-implementation-ig"><span style="font-weight: 400;">within the Research Data Alliance organisation</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The framework includes 14 features, or common elements, of journal research data policies – including data citation, data repositories, and data peer review – and reusable policy text for journal editors and publishers to implement on their journals.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2019, we compared PLOS’ data availability policy to this framework and, as a first step, updated some of the language, such as to give </span><a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/s/data-availability#loc-data-management-plans"><span style="font-weight: 400;">explicit support for sharing Data Management Plans</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (DMPs) – a document increasingly required in funding agency data policies. In doing so, PLOS continues to lead the way, by being the first publisher, to our knowledge, to align its entire journal portfolio with this new framework. As well increasing data sharing, another anticipated benefit of harmonising policy is reducing the burden on researchers and support staff with different or conflicting requirements between journals, and funders. The framework also provides future opportunities to review data policy language to ensure requirements are easily understood.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We’re looking forward to collaborating with publishers and researchers to continue driving up standards for transparency and openness in research in 2020.</span></p>

<p><i>By</i> <a href="https://emmayoung.net/">Emma Young</a></p>
<p>An estimated one quarter to one half of adolescents will at some point either be a victim of bullying, or engage in it — or both. Whether you’re on the receiving end, or dealing it out, there are all kinds of associated negative implications for mental health and well-being, including distress, depression and anxiety.  “This highlights an important need to understand the predictors of bullying and victimisation, in order to identify ways to reduce these experiences in adolescents,” write the researchers behind a <a href="https://academic.oup.com/scan/article/14/10/1027/5611070">new study</a>, published in <em>Social Cognitive and Affective Neuroscience</em>. And this research has revealed one such factor: both bullies and victims show differences in the brain’s response to angry and fearful faces.</p>
<p><span id="more-39223"></span></p>
<p>Johnna Swartz at the University of California, Davis and her colleagues studied 49 adolescents, aged 12 to 15 years old, who were recruited from the local community. They first reported on their experiences of “relational bullying” (either as bully or victim) over the past 12 months. This is a form of non-physical bullying that involves damaging an individual’s social standing and relationships. It might entail excluding a child from social activities — like a party or a group chatting at a lunch table — or spreading gossip or rumours about them. Next, the participants were shown a series of images of faces chosen to signal fear, anger or happiness while their brains were scanned using fMRI.</p>
<p>The team found clear relationships between patterns of activity in the amygdala (a region of the brain involved in detecting threats) and scores on the relational bullying questionnaire.</p>
<p>A combination of above-average amygdala activity to angry faces and low activity to fearful faces was associated with engaging in more bullying behaviour. Meanwhile, greater amygdala responsiveness to angry faces and/or higher responsiveness to fearful faces was linked to more experiences of being a victim of this type of bullying. The scans also suggested that increased activity in the rostral anterior cingulate cortex (rACC) in response to fearful faces was associated with less bullying behaviour.</p>
<p>“These results suggest that relational bullying and victimization are related to different patterns of neural activity to angry and fearful faces, which might help in understanding how patterns of social information processing predict these experiences,” the researchers write.</p>
<p>Exactly how those patterns may play out is not yet clear, but the researchers make some suggestions. When it comes to bullying behaviour, adolescents with a strong amygdala response to angry faces may be biased towards interpreting peers in ambiguous social situations as being hostile, they suggest. Low reactivity to fearful faces, meanwhile, may relate to a decreased ability to perceive or process someone else’s distress, which could lead to reduced empathy or perspective-taking. This combination might then make an individual more prone to bullying.</p>
<p><span>Meanwhile, a</span>dolescents with stronger responses to either fearful or angry faces, or both, may be more likely to avoid their peers, leading to increased rejection and raising the chances of victimisation, the researchers suggest.</p>
<p>What about the rACC findings? This region is involved in integrating social and emotional information. So perhaps, Swartz and her team speculate, heightened activity in response to fearful faces could reflect further processing of someone else’s distress, which may promote empathy, and reduce the likelihood of bullying.</p>
<p>The study does have several limitations. The sample size was relatively small. In fact, the results should be considered preliminary until they are replicated in a bigger sample, the researchers note. Also, as they didn’t measure levels of empathy, for example, the proposed explanations for the patterns in the data will need to be investigated in future studies. Then there’s the fact that this was a cross-sectional study. Perhaps differences in patterns of amygdala activity <em>resulted</em> from experiences of bullying or being bullied</p>
<p>More work is clearly needed to explore these questions. But given the scale of the problem, there’s an urgent need for such work. As the researchers themselves argue, “If these effects are replicated and extended to longitudinal research in the future, they will help to elucidate how biased patterns of social and emotional processing may increase risk for bullying and victimization in adolescents and could lead to more tailored intervention approaches.”</p>

Bucking the advice of university investigators, a journal founded by Hans Eysenck has issued expressions of concern — not retractions — for three articles by the deceased psychologist whose work has been dogged by controversy since the 1980s.  The move comes barely a week after other journals opted to retract 13 papers by Eysenck, who … <a class="more-link" href="https://retractionwatch.com/2020/02/26/journal-founded-by-hans-eysenck-issues-expressions-of-concern-for-his-papers-despite-calls-by-university-to-retract/">Continue reading <span class="screen-reader-text">Journal founded by Hans Eysenck issues expressions of concern for his papers, despite calls by university to retract</span></a>

<hr class="docutils" />
<p>The lack of a formal link between neural network structure and its emergent function
has hampered our understanding of how the brain processes information. We have now come
closer to describing such a link by taking the direction of synaptic transmission into
account, constructing graphs of a network that reflect the direction of information
flow, and analyzing these directed graphs using algebraic topology. Applying this
approach to a local network of neurons in the neocortex revealed a remarkably intricate
and previously unseen topology of synaptic connectivity. The synaptic network contains
an abundance of cliques of neurons bound into cavities that guide the emergence of
correlated activity. In response to stimuli, correlated activity binds synaptically
connected neurons into functional cliques and cavities that evolve in a stereotypical
sequence toward peak complexity. We propose that the brain processes stimuli by forming
increasingly complex functional cliques and cavities.</p>

This results in the formation of 3D cell-clusters which replicate many organ-of-origin characteristics. Current efforts to develop human organoid models will help us understand more about how our organs are formed and function and how to help in cases where diseases occur.</p>

The pancreas is located alongside the stomach and plays a critical role in our digestive system. Three main cell types are found in the pancreas; <strong>1) endocrine cells</strong> which reside in the islets of Langerhans and produce hormones including insulin that control sugar metabolism in our bodies, <strong>2) acinar cells</strong> which produce digestive enzymes and <strong>3) pancreatic ductal cells</strong> that form ducts (highlighted in figure 1) to collect the digestive enzymes and transport them to the small intestine to aid with the breakdown of food.</p>

<p>Malfunction of these cells is associated with a series of pancreatic diseases. Pancreatic cancer can affect any of these cell types and has the <a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanonc/article/PIIS1470-2045(19)30456-5/fulltext">lowest survival rate in the UK</a> among all cancer types.  Diabetes is the most common disease of the endocrine compartment and affects over <a href="https://www.diabetes.co.uk/diabetes-prevalence.html">4 million people in the UK</a>.  Other serious diseases, although perhaps less well known, include pancreatitis (inflammation of the pancreas), cystic fibrosis (which affects ductal cells) and pancreatic insufficiency (reduced acinar cell function). Severe cases of pancreatic disease often leave patients with the need for a pancreas or islet cell transplant deriving from deceased organ donors. However, the greatest hurdles to pancreas transplants include a limited number of organ donors and a need for life-time immunosuppression.</p>
<p>We aimed to produce a 3D culture system for long-term expansion of hPOs to serve as the basis for studies of pancreas ductal cells, pancreatic diseases and the development of cell therapy for diabetes. Whilst developing the hPO model we were aware that for a cell therapy to translate into the clinic it must meet certain criteria which include cell expansion in a chemically defined manner that is compatible with Good Manufacturing Processes (GMP) with strong evidence that the cells pose no risk of tumour formation.</p>
<p>To generate hPOs, we isolated ductal fragments from small samples of human pancreatic tissue and placed these in an ECM to act as a 3D scaffold. In order for this to be successful we had to develop a culture medium which would include all the signals and growth factors required to support the transition of pancreatic ducts into expandable pancreas organoids (Figure 2). Through a series of optimisations and iterations in which we tested activators and inhibitors of key cell signalling pathways we achieved a chemically defined culture medium that sustains the long-term culture of the pancreas cells. In addition, we developed a protocol to freeze the pancreatic tissue and recover healthy long-term expanding organoids from it. This gives us the ability to bank tissue, share samples and derive organoids at a later date.</p>
<figure class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_11730" style="width: 664px;"><img alt="" class=" wp-image-11730" height="375" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2020/02/pancreas-2-300x172.jpg" width="654" /><div class="attachment-image--caption">Figure 2: Human pancreatic ducts can be cultured in vitro and expanded as pancreatic organoids.</div><div class="attachment-image--source"></div></figure>
<p>Importantly, genetic analysis showed that even after long-term expansion the hPOs did not show large genetic abnormalities. This is crucial, as accumulation of genetic defects during culturing, can alter cellular behaviours and impact on the results. We also found that upon transplant of these cells into mouse pancreas the hPO cells do not form tumours, indicating their genetic safety both in vitro and in vivo.</p>
<p>Finally, we aimed to develop a chemically defined ECM in which to culture hPOs as the commonly used ECMs (Matrigel and BME 2-RGF) are animal-derived and are unsuitable for cell therapies. In collaboration with <a href="https://www.cellendes.com/">Cellendes</a>, a company specialised in hydrogel technology, we could show for the first time the derivation and expansion of hPOs in a fully chemically defined hydrogel.</p>
<p>Our demonstration of the long-term expansion of human pancreas organoids in chemically defined conditions makes this an exciting system for many areas of research (Figure 3). This system can be used as a model of healthy ductal pancreas biology and the development of disease models of the ductal compartment, such as cystic fibrosis. Organoids can also be derived from diseased states and have already been used to model different types of <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S009286741401592X?via%3Dihub">pancreatic cancer</a> (PDAC and IPMN).</p>
<figure class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_11731" style="width: 615px;"><img alt="" class=" wp-image-11731" height="222" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2020/02/pancreas-3-300x110.jpg" width="605" /><div class="attachment-image--caption">Figure 3: Human pancreatic organoids have the potential to be used in many areas of research such as investigations into healthy tissue, diseased tissue and regenerative medicine.</div><div class="attachment-image--source"></div></figure>
<p>Critically, our protocol does not rely on altering the genome or identity of the cells in order to achieve long-term expansion. This, combined with the lack of tumour formation when transplanted into mice, makes hPOs a safe approach for potential cell therapies. Cell therapies offer hope for patients without available curative treatment options. They provide the possibility of treating a disease by extracting cells from the patient or other donors, altering them in the lab to generate working cells and transplanting them into the patient. In theory, this would treat the disease while removing the need for immunosuppression as the cells would be either self-derived or very closely matched to the patient.</p>
<p>The adaptation of the culture system for human cells was funded by an EU programme (LSFM4LIFE) which aims at investigating the potential of hPOs as a clinical cell therapy. Whether hPOs could be the source for a cell therapy transplantation for diabetes remains to be investigated.</p>

<p class="BodyA"><span lang="EN-US">What makes for an attractive female body? Whatever your views on this, across cultures, <span class="Hyperlink0"><a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/41548386_The_Attractive_Female_Body_Weight_and_Female_Body_Dissatisfaction_in_26_Countries_Across_10_World_Regions_Results_of_the_International_Body_Project_I"><span style="color: black;">and socioeconomic groups in particular</span></a></span><span class="None">, there are some differences in opinion. </span></span></p>
<p class="BodyA"><span class="None"><span lang="EN-US">Western media, with its promotion of “thin ideals”, has been cited as an influence on attitudes. But the only way to really explore this is to study groups of people who are very similar, except that some have been exposed to Western media, while others have not. Needless to say, this isn’t easy. However, a team led by Lynda Boothroyd at the University of Durham has now published just such a </span></span><span class="Hyperlink0"><span lang="EN-US"><a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/fulltext/2019-76797-001.pdf"><span style="color: black;">set of studies</span></a></span></span><span class="None"><span lang="EN-US"> in the <em>Journal of Personality and Social Psychology</em>. Their data suggests that TV exposure does indeed drive both men and women towards finding thinner female bodies more attractive.</span></span></p>
<p><span id="more-39216"></span></p>
<p class="BodyA"><span class="None"><span lang="EN-US">The team studied residents of seven villages in the remote South Caribbean Coast Autonomous Region of Nicaragua. At the time of the research, these people had no access to magazines and, generally, no access to the internet. Over the past decade, the government has, though, gradually extended the electricity grid through villages in the area, making TV-viewing possible. </span></span></p>
<p class="BodyA"><span class="None"><span lang="EN-US">These people are mostly subsistence farmers and fishermen, with relatively poor food security. It has been suggested that people in such communities tend to find fleshier people more attractive — so if Western TV does have an influence, this would be a good spot to look for it. </span></span></p>
<p class="BodyA"><span class="None"><span lang="EN-US">For a first cross-sectional study, the researchers compared attitudes of people with regular TV access (Latin American soap operas, which feature thin, curvy actresses, and Hollywood movies were both popular genres) versus those who didn’t yet have it. A total of 314 men and women aged 15 to 79 gave basic details about themselves and rated the attractiveness of 50 colour photographs of women (with their faces blacked out) with Body Mass Indices that ranged from 11 to 42. (A healthy BMI is typically between 18.5 and 25.) </span></span></p>
<p class="BodyA"><span class="None"><span lang="EN-US">Two factors emerged as being associated with a preference for thinner bodies. One was a higher level of education — and this, the researchers note, implies that someone has spent time studying in a large town, which could have given them earlier access to Western media. The other was TV exposure. Though different ethnic groups had slightly different opinions, when TV viewers vs non-TV viewers of the same ethnicity were compared, the difference in the “ideal” BMI could be at least 5 points. For one group, it was about 22 among the regular TV-watchers vs 27-28 among those who had not been exposed to TV, or who had very little access to it.</span></span></p>
<p class="BodyA"><span class="None"><span lang="EN-US">The researchers also wanted to explore whether people who didn’t have access to TV and then gained it shifted towards preferring thinner bodies. For various reasons, this proved tricky. But for one village, it was possible to gather data on 31 individuals. The analysis did indeed suggest that with TV came a move towards finding a thinner female body most attractive. </span></span></p>
<p class="BodyA"><span class="None"><span lang="EN-US">For a final study, the researchers tried to mimic the immediate impact of TV exposure. They did this by showing villagers a series of photographs of either thin or plus-sized fashion models. After just 15 minutes of viewing these images, the participants changed their perceptions of the ideal female body size <i>in the direction of the images they had just seen</i>. </span></span></p>
<p class="BodyA"><span class="None"><span lang="EN-US">“These data strongly support the proposal that visual culture may be a critical contributory factor in the development of attraction in modern humans,” the researchers write.</span></span></p>
<p class="BodyA"><span class="None"><span lang="EN-US">There could be other implications of the work, too. The data “strongly suggests visual media may be pushing preferences below the healthy optimum in nutritionally vulnerable populations such as ours,” the researchers write. The most favoured BMI in one of the TV-watching villages was 22.5, for instance: if a woman with that BMI lost a stone of weight during a bad fish season, she would shift to 19.3. That’s still within the healthy BMI range, but only just. </span></span></p>
<p class="BodyA"><span class="None"><span lang="EN-US">And there’s another risk: exposure to Western body ideals and a more Western-style lifestyle (including a higher-calorie diet) often go hand in hand, making a thin figure even harder to attain — and </span></span><span class="Hyperlink0"><span lang="EN-US"><a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2008-04614-005"><span style="color: black;">promoting body dissatisfaction</span></a></span></span><span class="None"><span lang="EN-US">. </span></span></p>
<p class="BodyA"><span class="None"><span lang="EN-US">However, the work does also suggest a route to changing unhealthy body ideals: as sheer exposure seems to be so influential, altering the images people see could change perceptions in a healthier direction, too.</span></span></p>

<img alt="" class="attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image" height="110" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2020/02/slimming-2728331_640-140x110.jpg" style="display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;" width="140" /><p>We all have some knowledge about how to lose weight, but this does not often change what we do. Using formal weight loss services can be effective in helping people who want to lose weight. In most parts of the UK, people who want to lose weight can be referred to an evidence-based group or a one-to-one weight loss program.</p>
<p>However, engagement of men in these weight loss programs is low. Men make up 11-25% of people who go to Counterweight, Weight Watchers, Slimming World and Rosemary Conley Diet and Fitness Clubs. With a greater prevalence overweight men compared to women in the UK, and rising obesity rates globally, this lack of engagement is concerning.</p>
<p>Our study, published in <em>BMC Public Health</em>, sought to understand what influences the engagement of men in weight loss services.</p>
<p><strong><u>Study findings</u></strong></p>
<blockquote><p><em>Only me and two other guys and about 40 women [at Weight Watchers], which is a bit off-putting</em></p></blockquote>
<p>Through interviews with 18 men with different experiences of weight loss programs (from not taking part to repeated engagers) we identified two key themes: <strong><em>Fear as a motivation for change</em></strong> and <strong><em>Attitudes towards existing weight loss services</em>.<br />
</strong></p>
<p>Theme 1: <strong><em>Fear as a motivation for change:</em></strong>  A medical diagnosis, coupled with instructions and a referral from a healthcare professional, triggered feelings of fear and worry, which motivated men to engage with weight loss programs. Awareness of severe alternative treatments, irreversible damage caused by obesity and impaired mobility were also key motivators:</p>
<p><em>“My weight had gone up to 160kg … and my GP hinted at, well you don’t want to carry on putting on weight because you might have to have a gastric band </em><em>and I said no, we’re not going to go there</em><em>” [Participant 2]</em></p>
<p>Seeing the effects of long-term weight problems on family members often boosted men’s personal motivation and helped them to understand how severe their situation was:</p>
<p><em>“I lost my sister-in-law … for her whole life she had a massive weight problem, and I put it down, you know, at the end it cost her life” [Participant 8]</em></p>
<p>Theme 2:<strong><em> Attitudes towards existing weight loss services:</em></strong>  Although these medical triggers and fears were powerful, men were still often reluctant to join in or stick with weight loss programs. Two sub-themes may explain why:</p>
<p>Subtheme 1: <em><strong>Female-dominated services:</strong></em>  Men often found themselves in the minority, provoking feelings of self-consciousness and embarrassment, particularly due to the weight loss context:</p>
<p><em>“Only me and two other guys and about 40 women [at Weight Watchers], which is a bit off-putting” [Participant 4]</em></p>
<p>Some men felt that the female-dominated weight loss service threatened their identity and participating or worrying about weight was not perceived as a ‘manly’ thing to do; men also reported a lack of social support from discussing weight with peers:</p>
<p><em>“I think it’s just the stigma that’s attached to it for weight loss for men, they think it’s more of a woman’s thing to lose weight and worry about their weight” [Participant 7]</em></p>
<p>Subtheme 2: <em><strong>Incompatibility of existing services for men:</strong>  </em>Often, available services were not what the men wanted; programs that focused on discussing weight and praising weight loss were seen as intrusive and overbearing. This often led to men not taking part, only partially engaging or dropping out altogether.</p>
<p><em>“All clap each other and that, that doesn’t work for me, because that’s quite embarrassing for me. They have like a slimmer of the week and all that stuff, that doesn’t work for me” [P13, Repeater, Commercial]</em></p>
<p><strong><u>Implications for practice</u></strong></p>
<p><img alt="" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-11727" height="195" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2020/02/exercise-300x195.jpg" width="300" />Men in the study discussed strong motivations to lose weight, triggered by fear resulting from a medical diagnosis or complication. The findings highlight the importance of healthcare professionals raising the issue of weight with patients. However, men are less likely to visit the GP compared to women, so engaging men in alternative, non-medicalized settings, is also vital.</p>
<p>Findings that existing services are perceived to be female-dominated and misalign with men’s preferences emphasize the importance of providing a variety of service formats (e.g. men-only, mixed groups, one-to-one), which may be more compatible and satisfactory for men.</p>
<p>Understanding motivations and barriers to engaging is key to addressing them and reducing rising rates of obesity, overweight and associated weight-related health problems.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Every five or six years, UK academic researchers submit their most impactful research for expert review and evaluation by the four higher education funding bodies in a process known as the </span><b>Research Excellence Framework (REF)</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The results of this quality assessment inform funding allocations for the next cycle and can impact university reputations. For 2021, the REF has introduced a new Open Access (OA) policy for research published after 1 April 2016. </span><b>The good news is, </b><b><i>ALL </i></b><b>PLOS journals meet the standards laid out in the new REF guidelines.</b></p>
<p> </p>
<blockquote><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The four UK HE funding bodies believe that the outputs of publicly funded research should be freely accessible and widely available. Open access research brings benefits to researchers, students, institutions, governments, public bodies, professionals and practitioners, citizen scientists and many others.” </span></p></blockquote>

<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Why Open matters</span></h2>
<p><a href="https://www.plos.org/open-access"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Open Access</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> lets you maximise the impact or your research by making it available for anyone, anywhere in the world to find, read and reuse. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">With </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">immediate and unrestricted access to the latest research, we can accelerate discovery and create a more equitable system of knowledge that is open to all. That means connecting with interdisciplinary researchers in other fields as well as peers in your community, and providing teachers, students, funders, and policymakers equal access to the latest research findings.</span></p>

<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fully Open – beyond minimum compliance</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We tick all the boxes. PLOS articles are CC BY, embargo-free, fully machine readable, and automatically archived in PubMed, Medline, Scopus, Web of Science, EMBASE, and other databases-so you can focus on your science and leave the publication details to us. As a fully OA publisher, PLOS also complies with the stricter OA requirements of funders like </span><a href="https://wellcome.ac.uk/funding/guidance/open-access-policy"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Wellcome</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><a href="https://www.gatesfoundation.org/how-we-work/general-information/open-access-policy"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gates</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. And with individualised </span><a href="https://www.plos.org/article-level-metrics"><span style="font-weight: 400;">article metrics</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, you can track the impact of your research in real time across HTML views, pdf downloads, citations, and even social media.</span></p>
<h3></h3>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Submit your latest research in preprint form</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Each element submitted to the REF is rated on a 5-point scale between 4 (world-leading) and 0 (below standard) on the basis of originality, significance and rigour. Researchers demonstrate their accomplishments by submitting their most creative, impactful and technically demanding works. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In another exciting development, the 2021 REF will consider publicly posted preprints, even if the final article publication date falls outside the 31st December, 2020 cutoff. When you submit to PLOS, you can choose to have your manuscript </span><a href="https://www.plos.org/preprints"><span style="font-weight: 400;">automatically posted</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to bioRxiv*, ensuring your work will qualify for the REF regardless of publication date.</span></p>

<p><em>By </em><a href="http://emilyoliviareynolds.com/">Emily Reynolds</a></p>
<p>Deadlines, though stressful, can be a pretty good motivator. Knowing you have to submit some work by a particular date can make it easier to get things done; you simply have to get on with it. This also goes for non-professional deadlines — trying to get in shape by the time you run a specific race, for example, can be a lot more motivating than a more vague and nebulous desire to get fit.</p>
<p>But why is this the case? Maayan Katzir and colleagues at Tel Aviv University have investigated the phenomenon in a <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0010027720300081?dgcid=rss_sd_all">new paper</a>, recently published in <em>Cognition —</em> and they suggest it may be down to how we conserve and use effort.<span id="more-39095"></span></p>
<p>In an initial experiment, 64 undergraduate students were asked to perform a complex task, completing a series of trials in which they had to switch between four different activities: two Stroop tasks, in which participants were asked to name colours or read words, and two spatial tasks, in which they had to indicate the direction of arrows. In each trial, they also had to ignore distracting stimuli. Participants were told that those scoring in the top 25% on accuracy would receive a monetary reward.</p>
<p>Participants completed 10 blocks of 240 trials, making a total of 2400 trials. Importantly, one group was told that the experiment was split into blocks, and were given information about how many blocks of the total they had completed as they went along, while the other was not. Neither group received feedback on how well they were performing. After the third, sixth and ninth blocks, participants were also asked how tired, bored and energetic they felt, the answers to which were used to calculate a fatigue score.</p>
<p><span>Participants in the feedback condition </span><em>—</em><span> those who were aware of how far they had progressed through the experiment </span><em>—</em><span> had a higher level of performance, as measured by their speed and accuracy; this was particularly pronounced towards the end of the experiment, suggesting that knowing when a task is going to end does indeed make it easier to complete. Participants receiving feedback also spent less time taking breaks towards the end than their non-feedback peers, though they didn’t report feeling any less fatigued.</span></p>
<p>A second experiment replicated the design of the first <em>—</em> except, this time, there were even more blocks. Participants were asked to complete twelve blocks of 240 trials, bringing the total to 2880. And as in the first experiment, feedback on progress had a positive impact on performance. Participants in the no feedback condition also reported feeling more fatigued <em>—</em> but only towards the end of the experiment. This group also spent more time on breaks than those aware of how many blocks they had left.</p>
<p>So why do we perform better when we know a task is going to end? Our desire to engage in more interesting activities may have something to do with it. If we’re aware of the fact a tedious task is nearly finished, we also know that leisure activities are within our reach: remaining engaged in our task and taking fewer breaks means that those more tantalising opportunities are closer to hand.</p>
<p>It may also be to do with how much effort we allocate to particular activities, the team suggests. If we have no idea how much longer we’re going to be engaging in a particular task, we’re unlikely to put all of our energy into it; if we know the end is near, we feel more able to try our hardest without fear of running out of energy.</p>
<p>This could relate to how we <em>conceptualise</em> willpower, too: <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2020/02/19/why-some-people-find-it-harder-to-drag-themselves-to-bed-at-night/">another recent study</a> found that those who believe they possess a limited and finite amount of energy are less likely to motivate themselves to get to bed on time. So people who believe that our willpower is a limited resource may be particularly likely to try and conserve effort when they don’t know how much longer a task will last.</p>
<p>Those in the feedback condition did indeed perform better than their counterparts <em>—</em> but that doesn’t mean their performances were as high as they could be. It would be interesting to look at the timing of progress feedback <em>— </em>could introducing progress feedback only towards the end of a task push performance even higher?</p>
<p>What is clear, however, is that knowledge of how a task is progressing can have a significant impact both on how much effort you expend on it and how well you perform. So if you really want to get that boring bit of work out of the way? You may well benefit from setting yourself a deadline.</p>

<p>Social Psychology looks at the nature and causes of individual behavior in social situations. It asks how others’ actions and behaviors shape our actions and behaviors, how our identities are shaped by the beliefs and assumptions of our communities. Fundamentally it looks for scientific answers to the most philosophical questions of self. These seven books about a range of issues within social psychology—identity, gender and sexuality, radicalism, social assumptions and biases—address just a few of the questions about who we are.</p><ol><li><strong><em><a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://global.oup.com/academic/product/the-strange-case-of-donald-j-trump-9780197507445">Strange Case of Donald J.

An “engram” is the neural substrate for storing and recalling memories. Futuristic “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inception" target="_blank"><i>Inception</i></a>-like” experiments in mice have shown that conditioned fear memories (tone-shock or context-shock associations) can be deleted or “inserted” by manipulating a functionally-defined class of neurons known as engram cells.<br /><br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-u8pK5vlWtqg/XlIB70mZugI/AAAAAAAANDs/QraNC3lvH-IxvEF73koENGlzVAG1uBN5QCLcBGAsYHQ/s1600/An%2Bengram%2Bcell%2Balongside%2Ba%2Bnonengram%2Bcell.png" style="margin-left: 0em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" data-original-height="441" data-original-width="441" height="400" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-u8pK5vlWtqg/XlIB70mZugI/AAAAAAAANDs/QraNC3lvH-IxvEF73koENGlzVAG1uBN5QCLcBGAsYHQ/s400/An%2Bengram%2Bcell%2Balongside%2Ba%2Bnonengram%2Bcell.png" width="400" /></a></div><br /><span><b>A pink engram cell alongside a white nonengram cell</b> (modified from <a href="https://science.sciencemag.org/content/367/6473/eaaw4325.full" target="_blank">Josselyn &amp; Tonegawa, 2020</a>). Within the hippocampus, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dentate_gyrus%20title=" target="_blank">dentate gyrus</a> cells were filled with a tracer to examine cellular anatomy (white). Engram cells active during fear conditioning were engineered to express the red fluorescent protein mCherry, which appears pink (because of overlap with the white tracer).</span><br /><br /><br />A primary truism of neuroscience is that memory storage is mediated by structural and synaptic plasticity. If engram cells are dedicated to preserving specific memories, the next question is: how do you define “a memory”? Most rodent studies search for engram cells associated with memories like “this location = bad”. But what about engrams formed after learning a <a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2016.00654/full" target="_blank">list of words</a>? Memories of <i>Tomato</i>, <i>Attic</i>, <i>Pliers</i>, <i>Motorcycle</i>, etc. are presumably represented by overlapping/distinctive groups of engrams distributed across multiple brain regions. What about complex autobiographical memories, like what you did on your 21st birthday? The full day (and night) of festivities consisted of many different events tied together by their temporal proximity and autobiographical significance. Studies of event perception and segmentation (<a href="https://doi.org/10.1146/annurev-psych-010419-051101" target="_blank">Zacks, 2020</a>) are informative in this regard: <br /><blockquote>What is the relationship between event structure in perception and that in memory? There is strong evidence that the segments that are identified during event perception correspond to the representational units in subsequent memory. First, the boundaries themselves are remembered exceptionally well. ... Second, event boundaries tended to occur at points in time when many features were changing, and the participants remembered those points better. </blockquote><br /><b>Life Beyond Engrams</b><br /><br />The development of an appropriate animal model to allow selective manipulation of the whole-brain engram associated with one “birthday event” (but not the others) seems remote. Likewise, the often-involuntary nature of autobiographical memory retrieval (<a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0963721410370301" target="_blank">Bernsten, 2010</a>) <span class="st">— in my case, the spontaneous appearance of visual images associated with loss and grief </span><span class="st"><span class="st">— is not illuminated by current engram research.

                <h4><a href="https://xcorr.net/2020/02/21/transitioning-away-from-matlab/">Transitioning away from Matlab</a></h4>

<p><a href="https://xcorr.net/2020/02/18/how-i-got-a-job-in-industry/">In my last article</a>, I talked about how I got a job in industry. I had been programming Python on and off for 10 years when I got my first non-academic job. Having proficiency in a language that people use outside of academia will improve your chances of getting a job in industry. Learning a new language will also grow your abilities as a programmer and will unlock new projects and analyses you might have otherwise been afraid to tackle.</p>



<p>What if you’re in a lab that’s been using Matlab for years and you haven’t had a chance to learn Python? Here’s my guide to transition off of Matlab to Python. There are a few specific links to neuroscience at the end of the article, but it should be useful to anybody approaching Python from a Matlab background.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>This is part 1 of an ongoing series on learning Python. <a href="https://xcorr.net/2020/02/29/orienting-yourself-through-python/">Part 2 – picking Python environments, packages and IDEs is here</a>. <a href="https://xcorr.net/2020/02/21/transitioning-away-from-matlab/">Part 3 – translating old code with test-driven development is here</a>.</p></blockquote>



<div class="wp-block-jetpack-markdown"><h3>Learn Python the hard way</h3>
<p>Python is one of the most popular languages out there – <a href="http://pypl.github.io/PYPL.html">more popular than Matlab by a factor of at least 10</a> – and it’s the language the vast majority people transitioning from Matlab will choose. There’s two basic strategies you can apply here:</p>
<ul>
<li>Transfer learning (aka the easy way). You have things in Matlab you use every day – array operations, plotting, signal processing, etc. You learn to do the same thing in Python, <a href="https://cheatsheets.quantecon.org/">perhaps with the aid of a cheatsheet</a>. A lot of the Python data science API (numpy, scipy and matplotlib in particular) are very  similar to Matlab. They were originally built to replicate functionality in Matlab. With this route, you’ll get moderately productive very fast.</li>
<li>Starting from scratch (aka the hard way). Learn the syntax, then do something you couldn’t do in Matlab, for example:
<ul>
<li>Learn algorithms and data structures</li>
<li>Make a GUI application (e.g. in PyQT)</li>
<li>Make a game</li>
<li>Make a dynamic website</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>My <em>slightly</em> controversial opinion is you’re better off starting from scratch. If you use the transfer learning method you will be less productive than you currently are for a long time. You will feel annoyed at your own incompetence (<em>"why am I doing this to myself? I could do the same thing twice as fast!"</em>). Furthermore, you will have a tendency of doing things <em>the Matlab way</em> (using matrices for everything, index chaining, avoiding for loops) that are error-prone and you shouldn’t be doing in a general purpose programming language.</p>
<p>By starting from scratch you will learn new things you couldn’t do before at all – you will feel like you have new powers. You can write a GUI! You can make dynamic visualizations! You can make games! You can do deep learning! Your day-to-day productivity won’t suffer because you’ll be learning <em>new</em> skills instead of relearning old ones poorly. You’ll end up being more productive in Python than you ever were in Matlab. You’ll write idiomatic code.</p>
<h3>How long will it take to learn Python?</h3>
<p><a href="https://qr.ae/T3Q1WK">500 hours</a>. Ok, that number is made up, but it’s probably not far from the truth. You can learn the syntax in a weekend. You can make your first significant project in a few days. <a href="https://norvig.com/21-days.html">However, proficiency comes with time</a>. Don’t wait until 3 weeks before a technical interview to start learning. I’ve seen candidates do this, it’s not good. You’re better off asking for an interview in Matlab if you don’t have hundreds of hours of Python under your belt. Start today, keep at it every day (1-2 hours a day will suffice) and it will pay off.</p>
<h3>Why is Python so popular anyway?</h3>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yoshua_Bengio">Yoshua Bengio</a>. Again, I’m halfway joking, but one of the biggest reasons people have moved away from Matlab was the adoption of Python for deep learning. It started with Theano, which came out of Bengio’s lab. It built on numpy, scipy, sklearn and jupyter, all of which predated the rise of deep learning. Then came Tensorflow. People at Google were already using Python; Guido van Rossum, creator of Python, was famously employed by Google at one point. Google needed a high-level language to iterate quickly on models; many of the people involved in Theano were involved in Tensorflow. Python made sense.</p>
<p>It could have landed another way. <a href="http://torch.ch/">We might all be using Lua instead if Yann had prevailed over Yoshua</a>! But combine industry pressure, lots of money, the education sector needing a good first language, and open source, and Python is a runaway success now. And it might change in the future. Maybe we’ll all be using Swift in the future. Or Rust. Or Julia (my personal favorite!). For now, Python is the language to learn.</p>
<h3>I don’t even hate Matlab</h3>
<p>I’ve used Matlab extensively. I’ve been deep enough to create my own mex files and using Java. I’ve created GUIs in GUIDE. I have created pretty big codebases and classes. I even coded up my own neural net framework which I never published.</p>
<p>I’m not going to bash Matlab here. You can write good code in Matlab – and many people that have been using Matlab for years end up writing disciplined code. However, I have seen a lot of Matlab code of a certain kind – using matrices for everything (even though Matlab has dataframes and hashmaps!), avoiding for loops (even though it has a great JIT!), using a giant set of globals in GUIDE (there’s a way of writing good GUIDE apps, I’m sure!). It will take a little bit of work to unlearn these old habits if you have them.</p>
<h3>A curriculum</h3>
<p>If you have never seen or touched Python, you can start by learning the syntax and the basic data structures (tuples, dicts, and lists) through online resources.</p>
<p>Some sample websites are:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.learnpython.org/">Learn Python</a>. Skip the numpy and pandas tutorials, we’ll get back to that later.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-python">Codecademy</a>. Similar.</li>
<li><a href="https://learnpythonthehardway.org/python3/">Learn Python The Hard Way</a>. A lot of practical exercises in this one. 30$.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.makeartwithpython.com/">Make Art With Python</a>. If you’re interested in games and interactive art this might hold your attention. 30$.</li>
</ul>
<p>Most of these websites will have some sort of live evaluation directly on the website. Pretty soon you’ll need a local install of Python. I recommend installing the <a href="https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/">Anaconda distribution of Python 3</a>. This includes the <code>conda</code> environment manager, which will allow you to maintain different sets of packages.</p>
<h3>Picking a first project</h3>
<p>At this point, you could consider using Python for a project (no data science stuff yet). The first app I made was a GUI to upload files to a website. A few years later I made an app in PyQT to annotate physiological recordings with notes. You could make a website. Lots of different projects but basically make sure you cover the basics, meaning:</p>
<ul>
<li>functions – these will trip you up. Python has pass-by-reference semantics for object types. In Matlab, a function cannot modify its arguments (unless it’s a reference object, but these are pretty uncommon). But in Python you can mess with your arguments:</li>
</ul>
<pre><code class="language-python">def my_append_fun(a)
    a.append('b')

c = ['a']
my_append_fun(c)
print(c)
# Prints ['a', 'b']
</code></pre>
<p>It’s not good practice to do this, but you might do it accidentally and you will be very confused.</p>
<ul>
<li>modules – in Matlab, one file = one function (unless it’s an internal function private to that file). In Python you can have multiple functions and classes inside a file. Each file defines a module that can be imported. Then there are other people’s modules! pip! Understanding how and when a certain module or function is accessible is one of the subtle things about Python.</li>
<li>tuples, dicts and lists. A simple write-only type for fixed-length groups; a super-powerful hashmap type; and a variable-length vector. It will take you a while to understand the trade-offs for each of these types. Your assumptions will be wrong! You might think appending to a list in a for loop is super slow because appending to a vector is super slow in Matlab. Wrong! It’s actually super fast.</li>
<li>classes. Classes are behaviour + data. Maybe you’ve been doing OOP in Matlab. If not, it’s time to pick it up!</li>
<li>strings and file IO. Format strings, <code>with</code> statements, StringIO, regex – all workaday things in a general purpose programming language that you might never have touched in Matlab.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Data structures and algorithms</h3>
<p>Consider learning about data structures and algorithms. Many professional programmers are self-taught and never really learn about these fundamentals. They learn intuitively what is slow and fast, and can code many non-trivial algorithms. They might even use complexity analysis (O notation).</p>
<p>Once you learn data structures, your world will open up. This is especially true for people with a Matlab background because the language tends to force you to use the same structure over and over again (the matrix). You might not know what to do with tuples, dicts, lists and objects. You need some solid foundations to transition out of the weird programming model Matlab imposes.</p>
<p>Take the <a href="https://www.coursera.org/specializations/algorithms">Algorithms and data structures classes on Coursera by Tim Roughgarden</a>. These are the same classes you’d get in CS at Stanford, and they are very good. Really tough. You will feel like your mind is melting – in a good way.</p>
<p>You might try a daily challenge, like <a href="https://www.hackerrank.com/">hackerrank</a>. There’s <a href="https://projecteuler.net/">Project Euler</a> if you’re more math-inclined.</p>
<h3>The data science ecosystem</h3>
<p>It’s finally time learn the data science pipeline. Because you will have learned basic Python well, and the tools are very similar to Matlab, your transition will be very smooth. Here’s one tutorial that guides you through the <a href="https://realpython.com/matlab-vs-python/">Python data science ecosystem</a>. This means getting familiarized with:</p>
<ul>
<li>matplotlib for plotting</li>
<li>numpy for matrices</li>
<li>scipy for signal processing</li>
<li>pandas for dataframes</li>
<li>sklearn for machine learning</li>
<li>jupyter for dynamic notebooks</li>
</ul>
<p>The hardest package to learn for many people coming from a Matlab background is <code>pandas</code>. Why would anyone want to use pandas? <em>Can’t I just use a matrix?</em></p>
<p>How many times has your PhD advisor told you to label your axes in your plots? A thousand times? Labeling axes is important to understand what the data means. When you index into an unlabelled matrix, say <code>df(:, 7)</code>, you’re giving yourself the possibility of forgetting what the data means. Wouldn’t it be better to use <code>df.reaction_time_ms</code>? Yes!</p>
<p>You might even have learned how to do reductions, querying and aggregations on raw matrix. This code might give you the mean reaction time for participant 10:</p>
<pre><code class="language-matlab">mean(df(df(:, 1)==10, 7))
</code></pre>
<p>That’s bad! What if you add a column in your CSV? Then column 7 becomes column 8, your stats are wrong and you’ll lose months tracking down the issue. This code is super error-prone and makes kittens cry. I’m not saying it’s impossible to do this the right way in Matlab – I’m just saying that’s often how people do it. Compare the pandas way:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">df.query('participant_id == 10').reaction_time_ms.mean()
</code></pre>
<p><a href="https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/getting_started/10min.html">Take the time to read the pandas tutorial in full</a>. You might want to pick up a book as well after a little while, for instance <a href="https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/python-for-data/9781491957653/">Python for Data Science</a>.</p>
<p>At this point, you’ll need to practice your new skills. <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/">Join a Kaggle competition</a>, or <a href="https://www.coursera.org/specializations/jhu-data-science">follow a data science MOOC</a>.</p>
<h3>Specialized tools for neuroscience</h3>
<p>At this point you might be productive enough to use Python on a daily basis. Congratulations! It’s a good time to learn about Python neuroscience tools:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://nilearn.github.io/">nilearn</a> for machine learning with MRI</li>
<li><a href="https://brian2.readthedocs.io/en/stable/">brian</a> for spiking neural net simulations</li>
<li><a href="https://pytorch.org/">pytorch</a> or <a href="https://www.tensorflow.org/">tensorflow</a> for fitting ANNs</li>
<li><a href="http://www.mousemotorlab.org/deeplabcut">deeplabcut</a> to track animals without markers</li>
<li><a href="https://www.psychopy.org/">Psychopy</a> for visual stimulus presentation</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/NeuralEnsemble/python-neo">neo</a> for managing electrophysiology data in Python</li>
<li><a href="https://mne.tools/dev/auto_tutorials/intro/plot_10_overview.html">MNE</a> for EEG analysis</li>
<li><a href="https://docs.pymc.io/">PyMC3</a> for Bayesian inference</li>
</ul>
<p>Know of another indispensable tool? Write it in the comments.</p>
<h3>Transition existing pipelines to Matlab</h3>
<p>It will be hard to transition pipelines developed over years wholesale out of Matlab and into Python. You’ll want to freeze data obtained after running a pipeline into a file format that you can transport from Matlab to Python. <a href="https://scipy-cookbook.readthedocs.io/items/Reading_mat_files.html">Matlab’s .mat file format is readable in Python</a>. Since v7.3 .mat files are in the hdf5 file format, for which Python has excellent support.</p>
<p>In the future, you might find that you need Matlab for very little, and only one or two recalcitrant pipelines will need to be maintained. <a href="https://github.com/mathworks-ref-arch/matlab-dockerfile">You could wrap these pipelines in a docker image</a>, so they keep working for years to come, despite changes in OS and Matlab versions.</p>
<h3>Becoming proficient</h3>
<p>You might start developing significant codebases. Will you be putting everything in Dropbox? No, you’ll be using <code>git</code>! You’ll need to know the command line. <a href="https://software-carpentry.org/lessons/index.html">Follow the software carpentry class</a> and learn about the Unix terminal and source control.</p>
<p>To really step up your game, contribute to an open-source project. If you’re unsure where to start, <a href="https://www.brainhack.org/">join a Brainhack event</a> – people will ask for volunteers for their projects and they’ll guide you through the process of making a submission. Friendships will be created! Collaborations hatched! Bagels will be had!</p>
<p>Perhaps you’ll feel the need for speed at this point. Tear through billion row datasets with <a href="https://docs.pymc.io/">Spark</a> or <a href="https://dask.org/">dask</a>. JIT your for loops or compile them down to C with <a href="https://cython.org/">Cython</a>, <a href="https://numba.pydata.org/">numba</a> or <a href="https://github.com/google/jax">jax</a>. <a href="https://rlouf.github.io/post/jax-random-walk-metropolis/">Monte Carlo simulations with a thousand parallel chains</a>? Not a problem!</p>
<h3>Make it social</h3>
<p>People don’t realize how social programming is. As a software engineer at Google, I:</p>
<ul>
<li>Learned about the core tooling in seminars with other engineers</li>
<li>Had people review my code</li>
<li>Reviewed other people’s code</li>
<li>Pair programmed</li>
<li>Shared analyses with other people who critiqued the analysis (both the content and the method)</li>
<li>Went to retreats to learn new tools</li>
<li>Organized a reading group</li>
</ul>
<p>I learned more from these experiences than from much of the book reading and solitary programming I’ve done. You don’t have to make your learning journey an isolating one. When you do Kaggle, join a team. Go to local meetups – in Montreal for instance, there’s <a href="https://www.meetup.com/pitonneux/">Les Pitonneux</a>, who meet up almost daily. Many groups focus on supporting underrepresented groups in computer science, for example <a href="https://www.pyladies.com/">PyLadies</a>.</p>
<p>There are hackerspaces where you might find people in the same situation. You can go to tutorial sessions at conferences. Make friends and create a social support system to help you on your journey.</p>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>I’ve had to relearn programming many times over the years. Toolbook, QBasic, VB, Delphi, Actionscript, Perl, PHP – I’ve written significant chunks of code in each of these languages. They’re all either dead or on their way out. Having seen the trajectory of these languages, it feels to me like Matlab is on its way out as well. This doesn’t mean it won’t be used at all – after all, PHP is 10 times less popular today than at its peak, but it still runs Facebook! But it does mean that:</p>
<ul>
<li>There will be more people who know Matlab than people who are hiring people who know Matlab. It won’t do you any favors on your CV.</li>
<li>Professionals software engineers have already switched away from Matlab. You will have a lot of trouble hiring professional programmers to create Matlab-based infrastructure in your future lab if you choose to stay in academia.</li>
<li>The Mathworks is a single-source vendor, and their software is closed-source. What happens if they run out of business?</li>
</ul>
<p>It’s time to move away from Matlab. Take the first step today!</p>

                <h4><a href="http://romainbrette.fr/une-analyse-globale-de-la-nouvelle-politique-de-recherche-iii-faut-il-evaluer-la-recherche/">Une analyse globale de la nouvelle politique de recherche (III) - Faut-il évaluer la recherche ?</a></h4>

<p>Dans les billets précédents (<a href="http://romainbrette.fr/une-analyse-globale-de-la-nouvelle-politique-de-recherche-i-le-contexte-ideologique/">1</a> et <a href="http://romainbrette.fr/une-analyse-globale-de-la-nouvelle-politique-de-recherche-ii-prejuges-psychologiques-de-lideologie-manageriale/">2</a>), j’ai exposé le contexte idéologique des réformes structurelles de la recherche qui sont en cours. J’ai tenté de montrer qu’il s’agit de théories bureaucratiques dont l’argumentation est essentiellement obscurantiste, c’est-à-dire que non seulement une série de poncifs (il vaut mieux financer les excellents que les mauvais) et d’analogies douteuses (les vertus supposées du « darwinisme ») tiennent lieu d’argumentation, mais en outre les éléments empiriques contradictoires sont tout simplement ignorés.</p>
<p>Face à ce type de critique, une réaction courante est : mais alors, vous refusez d’être évalués ? On convoque alors l’image du savant dans sa tour d’ivoire, ou pire, celle du fonctionnaire fainéant. En effet, un point central des réformes managériales en cours est la notion d’évaluation : il faudrait développer une « culture de l’évaluation », avec des « indicateurs de performance ». Faut-il évaluer la recherche ? Pour répondre à cette question, encore faut-il préciser ce que l’on entend par « évaluer » et quels sont précisément les sujets et objets de ce verbe (qui évalue, et qu’est-ce qui est évalué).</p>
<p>Pour cela, il me semble utile de faire une petite digression philosophique pour comprendre la nature de l’activité scientifique qu’il s’agit d’évaluer.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><em>Digression philosophique</em></p>
<p>Qu’est-ce que la science ? Vaste question philosophique qui a été abordée par de nombreux angles et que je me propose de résumer en quelques paragraphes. Je me contenterai pour le sujet de ce billet d’une description assez grossière : la science, en tant qu’activité sociale, est la poursuite de la vérité. Description néanmoins un peu plus subtile qu’elle en a l’air : il s’agit bien de tendre vers un idéal de vérité sur le monde, mais c’est un idéal, c’est-à-dire quelque chose que l’on poursuit sans jamais vraiment atteindre.</p>
<p>Comment la science est-elle produite ? Une position philosophique historiquement importante, qui date du 19<sup>e</sup> siècle et début du 20<sup>e</sup>, est le positivisme : la science consiste à observer des faits élémentaires, puis à en déduire logiquement des lois de la nature. Il y a donc une méthode que l’on peut suivre pour produire des vérités scientifiques avec certitude. C’est en quelque sorte un modèle industriel de la science, et ce n’est sans doute pas un hasard si cette position est apparue au 19<sup>e</sup> siècle. De ce point de vue découle la conception naïve de la revue par les pairs comme certification des connaissances produites ou des méthodes employées. Point crucial, selon ce modèle de la science, il est trivial de distinguer la bonne science de la mauvaise science : la bonne science est tout simplement celle qui suit correctement la méthode scientifique (d’où le rôle présumé des journaux comme « gate-keepers » ; voir mon <a href="http://romainbrette.fr/revues-predatrices-quel-est-le-probleme/">texte sur ce sujet</a>). Dans ce modèle, on peut donc appliquer des méthodes industrielles de gestion, de « management » dirait-on aujourd’hui, parce qu’il existe des mesures objectives (externes) de qualité. Là est la justification de l’usage de la bibliométrie comme outil d’évaluation.</p>
<p>Or, si cette position reste populaire, en particulier chez les non chercheurs (mais pas seulement), elle a été essentiellement démolie par les travaux en philosophie et histoire des sciences au cours du siècle dernier. Le plus connu est sans doute Karl Popper, qui sous un angle logique a établi que l’on ne peut pas établir en science des vérités mais uniquement des faussetés - simplement parce qu’une proposition s’applique à une infinité de cas que l’on ne peut tous vérifier. Il s’agit alors de tester des théories, et non de déduire des vérités scientifiques. D’autres travaux, moins connus des scientifiques mais néanmoins très importants, ont montré que la difficulté est plus profonde que cela. Quine a montré que la notion même de fait élémentaire est une erreur conceptuelle. C’est une forme de réductionnisme de la connaissance (je reformule), l’idée que la connaissance est un ensemble de faits et lois indépendants les uns des autres. Or c’est impossible, car pour énoncer un fait il faut utiliser des concepts, c’est-à-dire des théories. Par conséquent, il n’y a pas de fait élémentaire mais plutôt un système (plus ou moins) cohérent de connaissances. Kuhn a montré historiquement que co-existent généralement des théories scientifiques contradictoires portant sur les mêmes observations, ou encore que différentes théories (ou écoles de pensée) considèrent comme pertinents des corpus d’observations différents. Lakatos (élève de Popper) a montré qu’une théorie scientifique est non seulement une théorie qui en principe doit être falsifiable, mais également qui en pratique est falsifiée, et que cette caractéristique n’est pas forcément dysfonctionnelle. C’est-à-dire qu’il arrive couramment que des observations inattendues semblent contredire la théorie dominante, mais pour autant la théorie n’est pas forcément remise en cause. A la place, l’observation est interprétée en postulant une hypothèse auxiliaire. C’est le cas presque systématiquement aujourd’hui dans de nombreuses branches de la physique parce que l’on considère les théories physiques bien établies. Par exemple : la trajectoire de telle planète dévie des prédictions des lois de Newton (ou Einstein), conclusion : il doit y avoir un satellite autour de cette planète (et non : les lois de Newton sont fausses).</p>
<p>Je pourrais citer de nombreuses autres contributions importantes. Pour le sujet qui nous occupe, le point important est qu’il n’existe pas de méthode scientifique que l’on pourrait appliquer pour produire des vérités scientifiques. Cela ne veut pas dire que la science est arbitraire, au contraire. Cela veut dire que la réflexion sur la méthodologie et plus globalement l’épistémologie font elles-mêmes partie intégrale de l’activité scientifique : il n’y a pas de norme objective externe à la communauté scientifique. Cela signifie que la science progresse non par la production et la certification des savoirs, mais par le débat scientifique. Ce point est crucial, car il fonde la justification fondamentale de la nécessaire autonomie scientifique. Il ne peut y avoir d’évaluation de la production scientifique selon des normes externes (notamment bibliométriques), tout simplement parce que ces normes n’existent pas.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><em>Evaluer la recherche</em></p>
<p>Revenons donc à notre question : faut-il évaluer la recherche ?</p>
<p>Premièrement, commençons par la motivation de cette question. La motivation, c’est que l’argent public doit être bien utilisé, c’est-à-dire dans l’intérêt de la société. Cela implique sans doute que les politiques publiques doivent être évaluées, c’est-à-dire que lorsque l’on modifie la structure du système de recherche par des réformes, l’impact global de ces réformes devrait être analysé. Or c’est précisément le type d’évaluation utile qui n’est pas effectué, ou qui est ignoré. Les réformes engagées depuis 15 ans, introduisant des nouveaux modes d’organisation (financement par projets par exemple) n’ont manifestement pas donné les résultats escomptés. Il serait donc logique de revenir sur ces réformes et de les modifier. Or ce n’est pas le cas : au contraire, il s’agirait d’amplifier ces réformes.</p>
<p>Ce qui doit être évalué donc, c’est l’efficacité globale du système de recherche, en relation avec son organisation. Si le système global doit être évalué, est-ce qu’il en découle que les agents individuels de ce système doivent être évalués ? Il y a ici un glissement qui est tout à fait fallacieux. Bien sûr, si l’on veut connaître, disons, la production scientifique totale du pays, on va additionner la production scientifique de chacun des chercheurs. Du point de vue individuel, cette « évaluation » est donc faite dans un but de mesure uniquement ; c’est seulement au niveau du système global que cette mesure sert à influencer l’action publique. Mais quand on dit qu’il faut évaluer les chercheurs, ce dont on parle c’est une évaluation qui a une conséquence individuelle et qui est donc utilisée comme outil de gestion. Par exemple, on donne une prime aux chercheurs qui publient plus, de façon à les inciter à augmenter leur productivité. Il ne s’agit donc ici pas simplement d’évaluer les politiques publiques, ce qui semble assez consensuel, mais d’instaurer un mode de gestion bien particulier, à savoir une gestion bureaucratique managériale, reposant sur des indicateurs individuels objectifs.</p>
<p>Or comme je l’ai expliqué plus haut, il n’existe pas d’indicateurs objectifs de la qualité scientifique à un niveau individuel. On peut dire d’un pays qu’il produit plus ou moins d’articles scientifiques, ou mesurer différents indicateurs macroscopiques. Mais aucune bureaucratie ne peut dire ce qui est « vrai » ou « important » en termes de vérité scientifique, puisque c’est justement là le cœur de l’activité des chercheurs. Une conséquence immédiate de cet état de fait est qu’instaurer une gestion par objectifs est nécessairement contre-productif, puisque les agents vont alors être incités à optimiser des choses qui ne sont pas alignées avec la qualité scientifique, chose non mesurable. C’est d’ailleurs un phénomène tellement bien connu qu’il a un nom, la <a href="https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loi_de_Goodhart">loi de Goodhart</a>. Par exemple, demander aux chercheurs de produire davantage d’articles a pour résultat que les chercheurs produisent davantage d’articles. Par exemple en saucissonnant les articles, en faisant des articles bâclés, etc. Cela fonctionne pour toute métrique qu’un bureaucrate pourra inventer.</p>
<p>Mais alors, il ne faut pas évaluer ? Premièrement, l’évaluation, comme je l’ai expliqué, est un aspect central et quotidien de l’activité du chercheur, si l’on entend cela comme la discussion critique des productions scientifiques. C’est le métier du chercheur que d’évaluer ses pairs - le mot « évaluer » est sans doute mauvais, du fait qu’il ne s’agit bien sûr pas de mettre cinq étoiles à la loi de la relativité. Simplement, cette évaluation n’est pas un mode de gestion, mais de débat, et ce débat ne peut se faire qu’entre pairs, pas avec une bureaucratie.</p>
<p>Deuxièmement, l’évaluation des personnes (et non plus des énoncés scientifiques) est naturellement inévitable à au moins un moment de la carrière : le recrutement (et, sans doute, la promotion). Mais encore une fois, cette évaluation ne peut être faite de manière bureaucratique selon des métriques objectives pour les raisons déjà énoncées. Elle ne peut se faire que par des pairs, de manière subjective donc. De quel genre d’évaluation parle-t-on ici ? Le discours managérial parle de « culture du résultat » : il s’agirait d’évaluer la production des individus ; à charge des individus que faire en sorte que cette production soit bonne – d’où une forme de « sélection darwinienne ». D’où un certain nombre d’indicateurs (nombre de publications, prestige des journaux dans lesquels elles apparaissent, etc). Mais d’une part on retombe encore une fois dans l’erreur positiviste (il n’y a pas, surtout sur des résultats récents, de mesure consensuelle de l’« importance » de résultats scientifiques) et d’autre part on commet ce qu’on appelle en psychologie un <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attribute_substitution">biais de substitution</a>, c’est-à-dire que le facteur que l’on cherche à évaluer est complexe et par conséquent on en utilise un autre plus simple (voir une <a href="http://romainbrette.fr/category/blog/hiring-committees/">série de textes</a> que j’ai écrits il y a quelques années sur les biais cognitifs dans les recrutements académiques). Que cherche-t-on à évaluer lors d’un recrutement de chercheur permanent ? Il s’agit d’estimer si, au cours de sa carrière <em>future</em>, le chercheur produira des connaissances nouvelles et intéressantes. Bien sûr on ne connait pas sa carrière future, on doit donc la deviner. Et qu’est-ce qui détermine la qualité de la production scientifique d’un individu ? Un certain nombre de facteurs, dont certains sont propres à la personne, comme ses compétences et ses qualités (rigueur intellectuelle et intégrité par exemple), et d’autres sont contextuels (collaborateurs, conditions de travail, et bien sûr hasard puisqu’on parle de recherche, donc de choses non connues à l’avance). Ce que l’on doit donc déterminer, dans le contexte d’un recrutement, ce sont les facteurs propres, c’est-à-dire les compétences et qualités scientifiques de l’individu. La production passée est bien sûr corrélée à ces facteurs, mais ce n’est pas ce que l’on cherche à déterminer. Enfin il y a un risque bien connu à substituer un facteur indirect au facteur causal que l’on cherche à évaluer. En plus de l’erreur dans la sélection elle-même, cette substitution induit des changements de comportement des individus visant à optimiser ce facteur non causal, ce qui finit par rendre la sélection arbitraire (loi de Goodhart). Par exemple, un étudiant ira dans un laboratoire connu non parce qu’il pense y apprendre quelque chose, mais parce qu’il a plus de chances d’être co-auteur d’un article dans un journal prestigieux.</p>
<p>L’évaluation, donc, doit être une évaluation des compétences et non des résultats. Naturellement, les compétences ne peuvent être correctement évaluées que par des gens eux-mêmes compétents, et non par une bureaucratie.</p>
<p>Faut-il évaluer la recherche ? D’abord, il faut principalement évaluer les politiques publiques de recherche. Celles qui sont instituées depuis 15 ans sont manifestement mauvaises et il faut donc les repenser et non les amplifier. Voilà l’évidence. Ensuite, oui bien sûr, il est nécessaire d’évaluer les chercheurs, au moment du recrutement ou de la promotion, et non comme mode de gestion quotidien. Et ce sont les compétences qui doivent être évaluées et non les « résultats ». Ces compétences, enfin, ne peuvent être évaluées que par des gens eux-mêmes compétents et non par des bureaucrates. Voilà en quel sens on peut dire qu’il faut « évaluer la recherche ».</p>

<p><em>By </em><a href="http://emilyoliviareynolds.com/">Emily Reynolds</a></p>
<p>Language learning can be a matter of much concern for new parents, who often worry about what their baby is saying, how they’re saying it, and when. With <a href="https://ed.stanford.edu/news/anne-fernald-how-children-learn-language">previous research</a> suggesting that frequent verbal engagement with babies can boost vocabulary and reading comprehension, this preoccupation is not without merit. But even those parents who aren’t too fixated on baby’s first word may in fact be improving their offspring’s language, even if they’re not aware of it.</p>
<p>A form of speech dubbed “parentese” may be a key factor in improving language learning in infants, <a href="https://www.pnas.org/content/early/2020/01/28/1921653117">a new study in <em>PNAS</em></a> has suggested. Naja Ferjan Ramírez and colleagues from the University of Washington examined the distinctive form of sing-song speech often aimed at babies, finding that it improved conversation between parents and their children and even boosted language development.</p>
<p><span id="more-39192"></span></p>
<p>It’s important to note that parentese is not the same as baby talk: it’s less “googoo gaga” and more an exaggerated form of normal speech. So rather than the nonsense noises that usually characterise baby talk, parentese is defined by the higher pitch, slower tempo and exaggerated intonation of the speaker, a tone many of us have adopted around children without even realising it.</p>
<p>The researchers assigned 71 families with typically-developing six month old babies to one of two conditions. In the coaching condition, parents were given feedback on their use of language, speaking style, volume of speech and parent-child turn-taking by a linguistic coach. These families were explicitly told about parentese and how to use it to engage children, and were played audio samples from recordings of their own interactions with their children to highlight particularly good uses of parentese and turn-taking. Language milestones were also discussed: when to expect infants to say their first word or use word combinations, for example.</p>
<p>The coach also gave the families “<a href="https://www.vroom.org/">Vroom cards”</a>, which give information about how to promote language during normal social interactions, and age-appropriate books. Families in the other condition received no coaching.</p>
<p>Families provided recordings of themselves talking to and with their children at six, ten, fourteen and eighteen months of age, and at the eighteen month mark filled in a survey designed to assess language and communication development.</p>
<p>As expected, the coaching made a big difference. Parents who had been given extra guidance both significantly increased their use of parentese and their level of conversational turn-taking compared to those who had not. Their children also saw the benefit, showing a greater increase in vocalisations between six and eighteen months than the control group. They also had larger vocabularies overall at eighteen months than kids in the control group, suggesting that positive changes in the way parents communicate with their children are not temporary but durable and long-lasting.</p>
<p>So why is parentese such a successful mode of communication? A dramatic change in pitch may have something to do with it, as may the exaggerated facial expressions that often accompanies such speech. These “make the speaker sound happy”, the team says, holding infants’ attention and allowing them to take in more words and meanings than if they were distracted.</p>
<p>Understanding the benefit of taking turns in conversation was also a large part of the coaching condition, and this social element may be a thus-far neglected explanation for the success of parentese. Social context is a crucial part of language learning — and if parentese increases social interaction, it follows that language learning may also improve.</p>
<p>The results also have some pleasing practical ramifications. Parentese was used by all of the families in the study — it was a basic feature of child-parent communication, which will come as no surprise to anybody who’s spent much time with small children.</p>
<p>But the majority of the parents involved in the study had no idea what exactly parentese did for their infants’ language development, and were not aware of when they were using it or in what contexts. Being aware of parentese and its multiple positive qualities may be very useful indeed for families who are hoping to improve their children’s language development.</p>

<p><em>By guest blogger </em><a href="https://twitter.com/sofia_deleniv">Sofia Deleniv</a></p>
<p>Most of us are not surprised to hear that a child’s chances of achieving success, physical health, and mental well-being depend heavily on the socioeconomic status of the family into which they are born. <a href="https://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/handle/10665/43943/9789241563703_eng.pdf;jsessionid=CD6C7826FEF557B4AD7ED1E929712790?sequence=1">A large-scale global study commissioned by the World Health Organisation</a> found that the lower the income of a family, the more likely their child is to suffer physical and mental health issues later in life, run into problems with the legal system, and die early.</p>
<p>But a physical lack of resources may not be the only factor driving poor outcomes. Last month, <a href="https://www.pnas.org/content/early/2020/01/01/1820845116">a study published in <em>PNAS</em></a> revealed that children’s perceptions of their family’s socioeconomic standing might matter more than how well their families are <em>actually</em> doing — at least when it comes to their mental health.</p>
<p><span id="more-39186"></span></p>
<p>Evidence that perceptions might matter more than reality has been around for years. Individuals who perceive themselves as having lower socioeconomic status tend to <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12600368?dopt=Abstract">report</a> having more mental and physical health problems than those who rank themselves as having higher status, even when controlling for common indicators of status such as household income and occupation. The existence of this so-called “status syndrome” raises the possibility that government-run programmes aimed at changing young people’s attitudes towards their status might somewhat offset the negative health outcomes of income inequality.</p>
<p>However, the alleged “status syndrome” presents a dilemma. What if an individual’s perceived status is actually just a more accurate reflection of their true socioeconomic status than the “objective” measures such as income that researchers frequently use? That is, perhaps individual’s perceptions tap into a host of other factors that determine opportunity — such as family history and assets — that are otherwise hard to measure.</p>
<p>In this new study, Joshua Rivenbark from Duke University and colleagues got around this issue by following more than 1,000 sets of same-sex twins growing up in a range of areas in the UK, from the most to the least deprived, over the first 20 years of their lives. The team measured the socioeconomic status of the families using a variety of measures, including information about parental education, occupation and income. They also gauged the <em>subjective</em> social status of their child participants at the ages of 12 and 18, by giving them an image of a ladder with five rungs and asking them to choose the rung which they felt best represented their family’s socioeconomic position relative to others across the UK. At various stages of the twins’ childhoods, the researchers also collected information about their health, attitudes and behaviours from the individuals themselves and their parents and schoolteachers. Now, for the first time, scientists could look at siblings raised at the same time in the same family and ask the critical question: <em>Do differences in their perceived social standing really matter?</em></p>
<p>It turned out that siblings could substantially disagree on their family’s social standing — a difference which had its consequences. At the age of 18, those who rated their family status as lower experienced significantly more mental health difficulties than their siblings, including depression, anxiety, conduct problems and pessimism about the future. In fact, subjective status was ten times better at predicting incidences of depression than objective socioeconomic status, and three times better at predicting anxiety. At age 12, differences between siblings weren’t related to differences in well-being, suggesting that subjective status begins to matter only in later adolescence — perhaps as teenagers mature and become more aware of their family’s standing.</p>
<p>Does this mean that perceptions of social standing might actually be more critical for an adolescent’s mental well-being than the physical resources and opportunities that come with that standing? This study might be the strongest evidence so far that this is the case.</p>
<p>There is another possibility: the relationship between perceived status and well-being might actually run in reverse. Compared to the sibling with better mental well-being, an 18-year-old experiencing internal struggles might simply be constructing a different narrative about their family’s social status. As teenagers grow to become <a href="https://www.annualreviews.org/doi/abs/10.1146/annurev.psych.52.1.83">more attuned</a> to social comparisons and hierarchies, they might be more likely to interpret their level of well-being — or lack thereof — through the lens of having a particular social standing.</p>
<p>In the future, we can begin to figure out the arrow of causality by asking children about their perceptions more frequently over the course of their development. Regardless of the direction of this arrow, however, it is clear that social hierarchies are a fundamental part of the human psyche. Even if our perceived place in the pecking order merely reflects our well-being rather than actually causing it, this only reveals the fact that we assume our social position has such power.</p>

Your editor has asked you to cover the suicide of a young man who lived in the town with his parents. You have been to their house but they would only speak to you through the door. It was clear they were not keen to be interviewed. Your editor is putting pressure on you to meet the copy deadline with something that will engage readers. What do you do?</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://bmcpublichealth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12889-020-8211-1">Our research study</a> published today in <em>BMC Public Health</em> describes the perspectives of bereaved relatives like those portrayed in this vignette, and provides examples of conflicts between their need for privacy and journalists’ need to do their job. Among the 140 suicide-bereaved relatives or friends who responded to our online survey, many described perceptions of journalists’ intrusive behavior, a failure to consult them appropriately, and inaccuracy in reporting. However, some individuals described the press coverage as an opportunity to raise awareness and prevent further suicides.</p>
<p><img alt="" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-11691" height="184" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2020/02/samaritans-volunteer-image-1-for-jan18-issue-300x184.jpeg" width="300" />Samaritans has published <a href="https://www.samaritans.org/about-samaritans/media-guidelines/">media guidelines on how to safely report on suicide </a>and additional <a href="https://media.samaritans.org/documents/Media_guidelines_-_Working_with_bereaved_families_factsheet_UK_Final.pdf">guidance on working with bereaved families</a>, to protect bereaved relatives from unnecessary distress, as well as protecting the public from the potential harms of irresponsible reporting. This is important because research shows that people bereaved by suicide are at <a href="https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S2215-0366(14)70224-X">greater risk of suicide</a> themselves, and insensitive reporting can increase their distress. It is also important because <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6066401/">irresponsible reporting is implicated in inducing further suicides</a>. Supporting the media to report on suicide responsibly is a key feature of <a href="https://www.who.int/publications-detail/preventing-suicide-a-global-imperative">public health policy on suicide prevention</a>.</p>
<p>Public health researchers recognize that journalists find themselves in a difficult position when expected to report on someone’s suicide, whether the deceased was in the public eye or otherwise. On reading our research findings Lorna Fraser, Samaritans’ Media Advice Service lead, commented:</p>
<p>“Reporting suicides can be one of the most challenging issues journalists face, where they must balance reporting a topic which is in the public interest, with avoiding any intrusion into the grief and shock of the bereaved loved ones left behind. It’s vitally important that journalists are aware of media guidelines and follow this best practice advice, due to the many sensitivities and risks surrounding this topic. We regularly hear from bereaved families with concerns about approaches from journalists and a lack of sensitivity with how their loved one’s death was reported. We ask journalists to bear in mind these are people who may be in shock and struggling to come to terms with their devastating loss. They may not even be aware that their relative’s death will be reported in the press. Many will consider this a personal issue and value the space to grieve in private. In addition to our media guidelines, Samaritans provides an advice service to media. Journalists can email us at: <a href="mailto:mediaadvice@samaritans.org">mediaadvice@samaritans.org</a>.”</p>
<p><img alt="" class="size-medium wp-image-11692 alignleft" height="135" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2020/02/supportaftersuicide-300x135.png" width="300" />Sarah Bates, Executive Lead of the <a href="https://supportaftersuicide.org.uk/">Support after Suicide Partnership</a> added “Suicide is absolutely devastating, and insensitive reporting of suicide can have a hugely damaging impact on both people directly affected by the death being reported, as well as anyone who has had a similar experience in the past, sometimes going back many years. At the same time, the press face real challenges when reporting on suicide in the public interest. There is such a need for responsible, informed, and sensitive reporting, consistent with <a href="https://www.samaritans.org/about-samaritans/media-guidelines/">Samaritans media guidelines</a>. Reporting must put the grieving family, friends, colleagues and professionals at the heart of every journalists’ approach. As Lorna mentions, journalists are often involved very soon after a death is reported, often before support services are able to establish a relationship with a grieving family. Therefore, the journalist may suggest that the family nominate a ‘spokesperson’ who can act as a bridge between the press and those most impacted – and have honest, open, and sensitive communication.  We feel that some of the vital aspects to responsible reporting include not giving too much detail when mentioning method or location, avoiding unnecessary use of images and always making sure that readers are directed towards the support that is available.”</p>
<p><a href="https://mybrotherkilledhimself.wordpress.com/about/">Emma Bird</a>, a journalist and blogger who has experienced suicide bereavement herself, commented:  “I welcome this research. Having lost my brother to suicide, I am now an unquestionably better journalist than I was before he died. I have the qualities that good journalists are supposed to have: I’m a good listener, I’m empathetic and people confide in me. But even so, if I had known back then what I know now, I wouldn’t have made such a hash up of door knocks and inquests. I have no qualms about suicides being reported but this must be done in a way that is sensitive to the bereaved and with an awareness for what they are going through.”</p>
<p>A key message of our research is that if the right approach is taken, journalists can potentially collaborate with bereaved relatives to write a story that both respects the bounds of their privacy and avoids misrepresenting the deceased. Additionally, by providing information on how to contact appropriate local and national sources of support, a news article can encourage people experiencing emotional problems or suicidal thoughts to seek help. In this way, journalism can be used to positive ends, reducing the potential for distress to relatives and enhancing communication of suicide prevention messages.</p>

                <h4><a href="http://yourbrainhealth.com.au/left-brain-right-brain-myth/">The creative-right vs analytical-left brain myth: debunked!</a></h4>

<p>I’m a neuroscientist by trade. Popular culture would most likely label me ‘<em>logical, detail-oriented and analytical’ </em>(which I am!)</p>
<p>BUT when I was in high school, I considered applying to art school and pursuing a career as a painter. And I dabble in botanical watercolour and love designing in <a class="broken_link" href="https://www.canva.com/">Canva</a>. You could also label me <em>‘creative, thoughtful and artistic.’</em></p>
<p>No doubt you’ve heard the concept that the left side of the brain is logical and analytical, whereas the right side of the brain is artistic and creative.</p>
<p>Maybe you even landed on this article because you googled the phrase and arrived here? (You’re very welcome!!).</p>
<p>The idea is that personality or cognitive processes (ways of thinking) are cultivated on one side of the brain or other, giving rise to the rather nifty idea that you are right-brained <em>or</em> left-brained, creative <em>or</em> analytical … neuroscientist <em>or</em> artist.</p>
<h2>No evidence from brain scans that people are ‘rig<img alt="" class="size-medium wp-image-6157 alignleft" height="228" src="http://yourbrainhealth.com.au/wp/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/brain-2062057_1920-300x228.jpg" style="color: #555555; font-style: normal; font-weight: 400;" width="300" />ht-brained’ versus ‘left-brained’.</h2>
<p>This popular notion was debunked in 2013 by University of Utah neuroscientists who used brain imaging to show <em>there is NO evidence that people are ‘right-brained’ or ‘left-brained’. </em></p>
<p>A team from the University of Utah scanned the brains of 1,011 people between the ages of seven and 29. They used a technique called resting-state functional connectivity magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fcMRI)… forget about that mouthful for now. The study tested the idea that one half of a person’s brain is more active, more connected and more synchronised than the other.</p>
<p>The team divided each person’s brain into over 7,000 regions and examined each region to see if it showed stronger activity on the left or the right side of the brain. They also looked for connections between regions that were more localised (also called ‘lateralised’) to one hemisphere or the other.</p>
<p>Because, as Jared Nielsen, a PhD student who worked on the study, said</p>
<blockquote><p>…we just don’t see patterns where the whole left-brain network is more connected or the whole right-brain network is more connected in some people. It may be that personality types have nothing to do with one hemisphere being more active, stronger, or more connected.</p></blockquote>
<p>Neuroscientist Dr Jeff Anderson, lead author of the study, said,</p>
<blockquote><p>It’s absolutely true that some brain functions occur in one or the other side of the brain. Language tends to be on the left, attention more on the right.</p>
<p>But people don’t tend to have a stronger left- or right-sided brain network.</p></blockquote>
<h2><span style="color: #000000; font-size: 20px;">How did the left-brain vs right-brain myth come about?</span></h2>
<p>The two hemispheres of the brain are <i>slightly</i> different anatomically and microscopically (which means they look a bit different when you look at them with your eyes and down the microscope).</p>
<p>And, the two hemispheres of the brain (connected by the corpus callosum) do perform different jobs. In the industry, we call this lateralisation of brain function. Lateralisation is the tendency for some neural functions or processes to be specialised to one side of the brain or the other</p>
<p>For example, the left side of the brain controls movement on the right side of the body and vice-versa. Speech and language, are typically jobs performed by the left hemisphere. But not <em>ALL</em> aspects of speech are left-sided. Intonation, for example, is found on the right. As an interesting aside…language and ‘handed-ness’ are related. Whereas 97% of right-handed people have their speech centre on the left, only 70% of left-handers do.</p>
<p>Also, studies of patients with tumours or stroke show that our sense of our body and limbs in space (proprioception) is more likely located in the right hemisphere.</p>
<p>Some neuroscientists theorise that these differences and the brain asymmetries of language, spatial perception and handedness probably led to the prevailing myth that personality and styles of thinking are also located to one hemisphere or the other.</p>
<h2>But what if <em>I AM</em> a right-brain creative type?</h2>
<p>Everyone has strengths and weaknesses. Everyone has talents, and everyone has weaknesses they need to work on.</p>
<p>Recognise and foster your talents. Set goals and develop new skills.</p>
<p>Just don’t attribute ‘whole brain’, global functions or personality or career choices to one hemisphere of the brain being weaker or stronger than the other. The brain is way more complex (and interesting) than that!</p>
<h2>Is there a problem with using left-brain versus right-brain … just for fun?</h2>
<p>One problem that has arisen from this mythology is the raft of books, tests, apps, workshops and online games that exploit the myth by promising to help you ‘tap into your creative right brain’.</p>
<p>Fine — if you want to spend your money on them and expand on skills and knowledge that you may not already have. BUT this simplistic right-brained vs left-brained view is not grounded in our contemporary understanding of how the brain works.</p>
<p>Also, believing that you are ‘creative but not analytical’, or ‘logical and unintuitive’ and that is hard-wired into your brain, is a rather limiting belief and probably becomes self-fulfilling after a while.</p>
<p>Christian Jarrett who writes for Psychology Today sums my thoughts up perfectly:</p>
<blockquote><p>I suppose the logical left-brain, creative right-brain myth has a seductive simplicity about it. People can ask – which kind of brain have I got? They can buy an app to target their weaker half. They can categorise languages and people as right-brained or left.</p>
<p>It’s tricky to combat that belief system by saying the truth is really more complicated. But it’s worth trying, because it would be a shame if the simplistic myth drowned out the more fascinating story of how our brains really work.</p>
<p> </p></blockquote>

                <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/~r/plos/Blog/~3/R0F4q7pU-O0/">PLOS and the University of California announce open access publishing agreement</a></h4>

<p><em>Note: PLOS and the University of California issued the following press release on Wednesday, February 19th at 9:00am PST.</em></p>
<p>SAN FRANCISCO — The Public Library of Science (PLOS) and the University of California (UC) today announced a two-year agreement that will make it easier and more affordable for UC researchers to publish in the nonprofit open access publisher’s suite of journals. By bringing together PLOS, one of the world’s leading native open access publishers, and UC, which accounts for nearly 10 percent of all U.S. publishing output, the pilot breaks new ground in the global movement to advance open access publishing and empower more authors to share their research with the world.</p>
<p>“Scientific research is increasingly an international endeavor, often at its best when it crosses conceptual, disciplinary, and technological boundaries,” said Keith Yamamoto, Vice Chancellor for Science Policy and Strategy and Professor of Cellular Molecular Pharmacology at UC San Francisco, and a member of the PLOS Board of Directors. “Building that global continuum of discovery demands open, efficient, and rapid distribution of information. This agreement shows that key institutional stakeholders — universities and publishers — can work cooperatively to develop sustainable models that serve science, scientists, and trainees.”</p>
<p>Under the agreement, which the partners are working to implement this spring, the UC Libraries will automatically pay the first $1,000 of the article processing charge (APC) for all UC authors who choose to publish in a PLOS journal. Authors who do not have research funds available can request full funding of the article processing charge from the libraries, ensuring that lack of research funds does not present a barrier for UC authors who wish to publish in PLOS journals.</p>
<p>The pilot will illustrate that an institutional participation model that leverages multiple funding sources, rather than only grant funds, can enable a sustainable and inclusive path to full open access.</p>
<p>“This agreement is the result of open and fully collaborative discussions,” said Alison Mudditt, CEO of PLOS. “Open access publishers and libraries are natural allies, and we’re thrilled our first agreement is with UC, given their reputation for strong action supporting open access in the market. Open access is evolving. We have a duty to meet those changing needs with solutions that ensure the future of open access is accessible for all.”</p>
<p>Most institutional agreements have so far focused on subscription publishers that are transitioning to open access. PLOS and UC believe that institutional agreements of this kind can and should include native open access publishers since they are already aligned with current and emerging OA policies and mandates. This pilot builds upon UC’s commitment to a level playing field that supports all authors and all publishers in alignment with the <a href="https://osc.universityofcalifornia.edu/uc-publisher-relationships/guidelines-for-evaluating-transformative-open-access-agreements/">university’s guidelines for evaluating transformative agreements</a>.</p>
<p>“UC and PLOS have a long and close relationship as leaders in open access publishing — and this pilot builds on that partnership,” said Ivy Anderson, associate executive director of UC’s California Digital Library and co-chair of the team overseeing UC’s publisher negotiations. “We want to make it easier and more affordable for researchers to choose open access journals like PLOS when deciding where to submit their work for publication. We intend to continue to partner with a variety of publishers so that together we can help lead the transition to full open access.”</p>

<p>This week on Journal Club session Yaqoob Muhammad will talk about the paper "Autaptic Connections Shift Network Excitability and Bursting".</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>We examine the role of structural autapses, when a neuron synapses onto itself, in driving network-
wide bursting behavior. Using a simple spiking model of neuronal activity, we study how autaptic
connections affect activity patterns, and evaluate if controllability significantly affects changes in
bursting from autaptic connections. Adding more autaptic connections to excitatory neurons increased
the number of spiking events and the number of network-wide bursts. We observed excitatory synapses
contributed more to bursting behavior than inhibitory synapses. We evaluated if neurons with high
average controllability, predicted to push the network into easily achievable states, affected bursting
behavior differently than neurons with high modal controllability, thought to influence the network
into difficult to reach states. Results show autaptic connections to excitatory neurons with high average
controllability led to higher burst frequencies than adding the same number of self-looping connections
to neurons with high modal controllability. The number of autapses required to induce bursting was
lowered by adding autapses to high degree excitatory neurons. These results suggest a role of autaptic
connections in controlling network-wide bursts in diverse cortical and subcortical regions of mammalian
brain. Moreover, they open up new avenues for the study of dynamic neurophysiological correlates of
structural controllability.</p>

<p><em>By </em><a href="http://emilyoliviareynolds.com/">Emily Reynolds</a></p>
<p>You’re exhausted. You’ve had a long day at work before coming home to make dinner, do some chores and relax, and now it’s time for bed. But for some reason — despite the fact you’ve been struggling to stay awake all day — you can’t quite bring yourself to stop what you’re doing and go to sleep.</p>
<p>If this sounds familiar, you’ll be pleased to hear that you’re not the only one who lacks willpower when it’s time to go to bed. It’s so widespread, in fact, that Katharina Bernecker from the Leibniz-Institut für Wissensmedien and Veronika Job at the Technical University of Dresden have investigated what could be driving the phenomenon <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/bjop.12382?af=R">in a new paper</a> published in the <em>British Journal of Psychology</em>.</p>
<p><span id="more-39173"></span></p>
<p>Bernecker and Job believed that our failure to drag ourselves to bed at night is a failure of self-control: for some reason, we can’t muster the willpower needed to do what we need to do. Furthermore, they posited that our <em>beliefs</em> about our own willpower may predict how long we spend procrastinating before bed.</p>
<p>The team issued questionnaires to 173 college-age participants. First, participants were asked to agree or disagree with a number of statements, each reflecting one of two theories of willpower. Those who believe in the <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2015/06/24/new-research-challenges-the-idea-that-willpower-is-a-limited-resource/">“limited” theory</a> see willpower as a finite resource: once you’ve used it up, it’s gone until it is replenished by relaxation or sleep. Proponents of the “non-limited” theory, on the other hand, believe willpower can be tapped into at any time using self-control.</p>
<p>Participants also rated their own levels of self-control, and indicated whether they thought of themselves or a morning or evening person. They were also asked what their ideal bedtime would be.</p>
<p>After this initial questionnaire, participants completed daily diaries for ten days. Surveys were sent out each morning, measuring what time participants had gone to sleep the previous night (as opposed to when they went to <em>bed</em>), when they had woken up and how high quality their sleep was. Levels of stress were also measured. The last questionnaire of the ten measured bedtime procrastination, asking participants to select on a five point scale whether they are more likely to go to bed later than intended or to go to bed early.</p>
<p>The results suggested that theories of willpower do, in fact, influence how much people procrastinate before bed. Those with a non-limited theory of willpower were far less likely to procrastinate on highly stressful days, while those with a limited theory of willpower procrastinated for around 40-50 mins regardless of how stressful their day was.</p>
<p>A second study looked at the effect in adolescents. A total of 137 seventh, eighth and ninth grade students were given pen and paper surveys each morning in class for four days. Information was also gathered on self-control and willpower theories.</p>
<p>Teens may have parents telling them to go to bed, but the results suggest that sleep procrastination is still a significant problem: on average, students taking part in the study missed their ideal bedtime by an hour and a half.</p>
<p>And, as the first study had found, stress and willpower theories had a combined impact on when students were going to bed. Those who believed in the limited theory procrastinated more on stressful days — thus impacting how long they slept, and often the quality of their sleep — while those with the non-limited theory didn’t show any difference between high and low stress days.</p>
<p>What we don’t know — and what this research doesn’t quite touch on — is exactly <em>why</em> people who believe that we have a limited reserve of mental energy get the urge to procrastinate before bed when stressed. Logically, if they’ve had a bad or stressful day, they should be happy to get into bed. But, according to these results, they are more likely to prolong their day instead.</p>
<p>The team has a few suggestions as to why this is. Firstly, those who subscribe to the limited theory may feel they need more time to recover from a stressful day, thus spending more time on relaxing or mindless activities like watching TV. These activities also have the added benefit of providing instant gratification: yes, we might feel refreshed after a good night’s sleep, but we have to wait eight hours for that. If we sit on the internet for a bit longer, we get that hit immediately.</p>
<p>Gaining a better understanding of what people are doing to procrastinate may also be useful: some may be relaxing, whilst others may be catching up on a work overflow from a stressful day. Working out what exactly it is we get from these activities may be a good first step on the road to a better night’s sleep.</p>

<h2>The three facts about the teenage brain scholars can agree on</h2>
<p><em>1. Brain structures continue to change between childhood and adulthood.</em> Grey matter volume peaks at puberty then declines throughout adolescence and into the twenties. White matter volume increases throughout childhood, adolescence and into adulthood.</p>
<p><em>2. Girls’ brains mature slightly faster than boys’.</em> But boys catch up. This sex difference in brain development is in sync with physical development where, on average, girls enter puberty a year or two before boys, who then quickly catch up.</p>
<p><em>3. Different brain regions mature at different rates.</em> Development of the limbic system, which drives emotions, speeds up at puberty, but the PFC, which is involved in thinking and judgement, doesn’t mature until our twenties. This causes a ‘developmental mismatch’ between emotion and reward processing, and thinking and judgement. The mismatch determines aspects of teenage behaviour such as being overly emotional, impulsive and hypersensitive to social situations.</p>

<div class="column">
<h2>Grey matter thins as connections are refined</h2>
<p>The prefrontal cortex, as its name suggests, sits at the front of the brain and is sometimes called the brain’s CEO because it acts as an experienced decision-maker. The PFC is involved direction attention, judgement calls, emotion regulation, strategy, impulse control, working memory and social cognition – navigating complex social relationships such as discerning friend from ‘frenemy’ from foe.</p>
<p>During childhood, the grey matter of the PFC thickens as neurons make new connections or synapses. Much like a tree growing extra branches, twigs and roots.</p>
<p>However, during the teens, PFC <em>thinning</em> occurs. Loss or ‘thinning’ of grey matter always sounds unhealthy, but as is often the case with the brain, less is more. Grey matter loss is vitally important and is due to pruning away of unwanted ‘twigs and branches’, which partly depends on experience in a ‘use it or lose it’ manner. Connections that are being used are strengthened and those that aren’t being used are pruned away.</p>

<div class="column">
<h2>More white matter enables faster communication</h2>
<p>MRI scans have revealed ever-increasing volumes of white matter in the tracts leading to and from the PFC during adolescence. Recall that axons are insulated by myelin, which speeds up signalling between brain regions. Myelinated axons transmit impulses up to 100 times faster than unmyelinated axons, and faster transmission means faster mental processing.</p>
<p>Jay Giedd, a neuroscientist at the University of California, San Diego, has found that increased white matter means the connections between brain regions become stronger and more numerous. The brain matures by becoming more interconnected and more specialised.</p>
<p>To use Giedd’s metaphor, brain maturation is not so much a matter of adding new letters to the alphabet but one of combining existing letters into words, words into sentences and sentences into paragraphs.</p>
<blockquote><p>‘These changes ultimately help the brain to specialise in everything from complex thinking to being socially adept.’</p></blockquote>
<h2>Subcortical brain areas shrink and grow</h2>
<p>Changes to white and grey matter structure are not restricted to the PFC. Subcortical brain structures start to mature right around puberty, and development is more or less complete by the mid-teenage years.</p>
<p>Subcortical brain regions are those deep inside the brain under (‘sub’) the cortex in the frontal and temporal lobes. They include the limbic system (hippocampus and amygdala), and the corpus striatum, which is made up of four parts: nucleus accumbens, caudate, putamen and globus pallidus. They’re connected to the PFC and to each other by bundles of axons.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="page" title="Page 122">
<div class="layoutArea">
<div class="column">
<p>In girls, the amygdala and hippocampus get bigger during puberty. At the same time, the four structures making up the corpus striatum all shrink. Maturation of subcortical structures is fastest in late childhood and early adolescence but the rate of growth or shrinkage slows right down after age sixteen.</p>
</div>
</div>

<h2>Teenage girls can be very emotional (no kidding!).</h2>
<p>But not all teenage girls experience ‘storm and stress’. When I was seventeen, my levels of anxiety during final-year high-school exams were so out of control I ended up at the family GP being treated for panic attacks. But the vast majority of my teen years were joyful, empowering and a whole lot of fun.</p>
<p>Sarah Whittle is an associate professor of psychiatry at the University of Melbourne, where she specialises in adolescent brain development and resilience. Whittle explained to me that the emotional lives of teenage girls differ from adults because of the ‘developmental mismatch’ between their <em>‘rational PFC’</em> and <em>‘emotional limbic brain’</em>.</p>
<blockquote><p>It’s still only a theory, but the evidence is stacking up that hyperactivity of the limbic system is responsible for heightened emotional reactivity in adolescents. As the PFC matures, its ability to regulate the activity in subcortical structures improves.</p></blockquote>

<h2>Learning to regulate emotions is a vital skill to learn in adolescence</h2>
<p>Being able to calmly assess and keep emotions in check is a crucial life skill. Emotional regulation lets us navigate changing social landscapes and foster mental wellbeing. One of the most effective ways to regulate your emotions is a technique called cognitive reappraisal. Cognitive reappraisal changes the way you interpret a situation, which in turn calms your hot-headed response.</p>
<p>Imagine you’re fourteen and walking up to the front door of a party. Inside you can hear all your girlfriends laughing hysterically. Your appraisal of the situation might be, <em>‘OMG! They’re laughing about me behind my back.’</em> That appraisal (correct or not) will likely trigger intense feelings of sadness and rejection, and might quickly be followed by the thought, <em>‘They hate me. I’m going home!’</em></p>
<p>A different way of thinking about the situation – the reappraisal – might be, <em>‘Sure, they’re laughing. Perhaps someone told a funny joke. Maybe I should go inside and find out.’</em> The reappraisal (correct or not) encourages you to consider different perspectives and leads to a way of thinking that keeps a lid on emotional distress.</p>
<h2>Adults are much better at cognitive reappraisal than children and teens.</h2>
<p>We’re more experienced with a range of social situations and better at deploying the thinking skills required.</p>
<p>The neural basis of cognitive reappraisal is studied by eliciting negative emotions with provocative or distressing photos comprised of images that range from neutral (furniture or landscapes) to horrific or exciting scenes (mutilated bodies or erotic nudes).</p>
<p>Whittle’s research shows that teenage girls find the photos much more emotionally disturbing or arousing than adults. In her lab, fMRI shows that deploying the skill of cognitive reappraisal activates a distributed cortical network including the PFC, which in turn down-regulates excitability in the limbic system.</p>

<div class="layoutArea">
<div class="column">
<h2>Emotional regulation skills don’t always magically appear as we mature, but they can be formally taught.</h2>
<p>Whittle coaches her teenage volunteers in cognitive reappraisal by encouraging them to think, <em>‘This isn’t real, it’s a scene from a movie’,</em> or, ‘The situation looks worse than it is’, or, <em>‘It could be a lot worse’, or, ‘At least it is not me in that situation’.</em></p>

<div class="column">
<h2>Is mental illness emotional development gone wrong?</h2>
<p>One theme in adolescent brain research can be summed up by the phrase ‘moving parts get broken’. Because the teenage brain is undergoing such extensive remodelling, it’s thought that it’s easy for the wiring to go awry, predisposing girls to depression, anxiety and eating disorders.</p>
<p>The emotional life of teenage girls is complex both inside and out. It’s clear that ‘inside’ hormones are fluctuating and neural networks are fine-tuning. But we tend to forget the dynamic shifts taking place ‘outside’.</p>
<h2>Many emotions teens experience are novel</h2>
<p>Especially those taking place in new social contexts. There is a first time for everything and that includes your first crush (especially if it’s unrequited), experience of jealousy, being left off the party invite list, and getting likes on Instagram. The newness of these experiences heightens their emotional impact. Sometimes this is positive – falling in love for the first time is pretty wonderful! Sometimes this is negative – being rejected by your first love is rather painful.</p>

<h2>Girls’ preference for emotional intimacy increases during their early teenage years.</h2>
<p>Intense ‘bosom buddy’ friendships form around the same time girls ‘break up’ with their families. This leaves girls potentially vulnerable if those friendships break down or are less than ideal. Loss of friendship is a significant and overlooked potential cause of stress.</p>
<p>While the ‘wrong’ friendships can lead teens astray, the ‘right’ kinds of friends are powerful and protective. I had one such dear friend all through high school (we’re still close now and I’ve called on her psychiatric training to inform sections of this book). While writing this chapter we talked about how our devoted friendship buffered us from the tumult so many of our peers experienced. We know the happiest teens aren’t the ones who have the most ‘friends’ on Instagram but the ones who have a few close supportive friendships, and sometimes that means having one terrific friend.</p>
