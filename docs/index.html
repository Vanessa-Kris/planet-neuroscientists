A group of researchers in Japan who study oral stem cells has lost at least nine papers for fabricated data.  We reported on this group, from Aichi Gakuin University in Nagoya, last year after they lost two papers in PLOS ONE for image manipulation. The new retraction notice appears in the Journal of Oral Biosciences, … <a class="more-link" href="https://retractionwatch.com/2020/09/25/no-original-data-stem-cell-researchers-in-japan-up-to-nine-retractions/">Continue reading <span class="screen-reader-text">“No original data”: Stem cell researchers in Japan up to nine retractions</span></a>

                <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/hope-life-venus-survives-centuries-against-all-odds">Hope for life on Venus survives for centuries against all odds</a></h4>

<p>If you’re looking for an exemplar of mastering multiple identities, find a telescope and point it at Venus.</p>



<p>In both astronomy and popular culture, Venus has always assumed a diversity of guises. Morning star, evening star. Goddess. Planet. Frankie Avalon song. A plant that eats flies. And the realm ruled by women in the unforgettable film <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0052104/"><em>Queen of Outer Space</em></a> (starring Zsa Zsa Gabor as the nemesis of the evil queen).</p>



<p>So it’s not surprising that Venus enjoys sufficient celebrity status to warrant big-type headlines when it makes news, or at least a lot of social media hype. In the latest such instance, all it took was a whiff of a noxious gaseous chemical in the planet’s clouds, hinting that Venus might harbor life, to stop the presses and start the tweetstorms. After all, life on Venus would be a big surprise. Scientists have long considered it the hell of the solar system, hotter than molten lead and with an unbreathable atmosphere.</p>



<p>Yet, as it was so ably <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/phosphine-gas-found-venus-atmosphere-possible-sign-life">reported by Lisa Grossman</a> for <em>Science News</em>, the chemical in question, phosphine, is no guarantee of life on Venus. It’s just that the known nonbiologic ways to make phosphine do not seem plausible in the Venusian environment. Phosphine’s persistence in the clouds shrouding Venus suggests something must be currently producing it — otherwise the sulfuric acid in the planet’s upper atmosphere would have destroyed any signs of the gas by now. So phosphine might be a signal of life — perhaps some form of anaerobic bacteria (which do not require oxygen), as phosphine would be deadly to life that relied on oxygen.</p>





<p>On the other hand, maybe there’s just a gap in Earthling chemistry textbooks, and some weird geochemical reactions produce Venusian phosphine. That’s probably a better bet than airborne anaerobic alien organisms. Phosphine as evidence of life on Venus may turn out to be as reliable as the famous “canals” once regarded as evidence for life on Mars.</p>



<p>Still, hope for life on Venus never dies. In centuries past, in fact, many scientists simply assumed that Venus possessed life. In the late 17th century, Bernard le Bovier de Fontenelle, a French popularizer of science, surmised Venus to be inhabited by a gallant race of lovers. “The climate is most favorable for love matches,” he wrote. About the same time, the Dutch physicist and astronomer Christiaan Huygens contemplated life on Venus. Venusians would receive twice the light and heat from the sun as Earthlings do, he knew, but noted that Earth’s tropics, though much hotter than northern lands, are successfully occupied by people. For that matter, Huygens believed much hotter Mercury to be populated as well, and that the Mercurians would no doubt consider Earth much too cold and dark to support life.</p>



<p>In the 19th century, spectroscopic examination of Venus suggested that its atmosphere was similar to Earth’s, containing water vapor and oxygen. Since Earth’s atmospheric composition owed so much to life, it seemed obvious that life — at least plants— must exist on Venus as well. “If there be oxygen in the atmosphere of Venus, then it would seem possible that there might be life on that globe not essentially different in character from some forms of life on the earth,” astronomer Robert S. Ball wrote in his widely read late 19th century book <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/27378"><em>The Story of the Heavens</em></a>. “If water be present on the surface of Venus and if oxygen be a constituent of its atmosphere, we might expect to find in that planet a luxuriant tropical life.”</p>



<p>As late as 1918, <a href="https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/chemistry/1903/arrhenius/biographical/">Svante Arrhenius</a>, a Nobel chemistry laureate, estimated that water was especially abundant on Venus, with humidity six times the average on Earth. “We must therefore conclude that everything on Venus is dripping wet” — thereby accelerating the growth of vegetation, Arrhenius wrote.</p>



<p>But the early observations of Venus’ atmosphere were crude. About a century ago, refined techniques at the Mount Wilson Observatory in California contradicted the previous findings; oxygen and water vapor actually seemed scarce in the Venusian clouds. (In fact, as spacecraft visiting Venus in recent decades have shown, the air there is <a href="https://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/planetary/factsheet/venusfact.html">nearly all carbon dioxide with a little bit of nitrogen</a>, plus only slight traces of water.) “It may be that the exacting conditions for the origin of life have not been satisfied” on Venus, Charles E. St. John and Seth B. Nicholson wrote <a href="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/full/1922ApJ....56..380S">in 1922 in <em>the Astrophysical Journal</em></a>.</p>



<p>Of course, it was possible that conditions on the surface, hidden by the thick clouds, might still allow life to find a way. </p>



<p>“There is a possibility that the atmosphere of Venus is permeated with a finely divided dust, a possible product of intense volcanic activity, which would act as an excellent reflector of the sun’s rays and would at the same time effectually conceal the surface,” Isabel Lewis of the U.S. Naval Observatory wrote in <em>Science News-Letter</em>, the predecessor of <em>Science News</em>, in 1922. In 1926, the prominent astronomer Harlow Shapley maintained that in the solar system, Venus “more nearly fulfills the conditions [for life] than any planet other than the Earth…. But we cannot penetrate the dense covering of clouds and seek out the secrets of its surface.”</p>



<p>In 1927, <em>Science News-Letter</em> writer Frank Thone surveyed the prospects for life on other planets and declared Venus “the darling of the solar system” (excepting Earth, of course). While Mars seemed “wry and withered,” he wrote, “our sister Venus seems to have the vigor and sap of life in her.”</p>



<p>Yet as Thone acknowledged, the thick atmosphere guarding Venus’ surface from view made the question of life there unanswerable — probably, Thone guessed, for many generations.</p>



<p>And so today, the mystery remains unsolved. Phosphine sightings leave the question of whether Venus hosts life in a situation similar to that of Mars, long ago, when the newspaper publisher William Randolph Hearst (legend has it) cabled an astronomer asking for an article on the topic. “Is there life on Mars? Please cable one thousand words,” Hearst wrote. To which the astronomer cabled back: “Nobody knows. Repeat 500 times.”</p>

                <h4><a href="https://ptrrupprecht.wordpress.com/2020/09/25/interview-with-bruno-pichler/">Interview with Bruno Pichler</a></h4>

<p><em>Bruno Pichler studied medicine, obtained a PhD in neuroscience, worked in the labs of <a href="http://www.ifn.me.tum.de/new/konnerth.php">Arthur Konnerth</a>, <a href="https://www.sainsburywellcome.org/web/groups/mrsic-flogel-lab">Tom Mrsic-Flogel</a> and <a href="https://www.sainsburywellcome.org/web/groups/margrie-lab">Troy Margrie</a>, and was R&amp;D manager at <a href="https://www.scientifica.uk.com/">Scientifica</a>, before founding his own company, <a href="https://www.inss.org.uk/">INSS</a>, “to provide the international neuroscience community with bespoke hard- and software solutions and other consulting services”. He is not only a highly experienced builder and designer of two-photon microscopes but also a very friendly and open human being. So I was very happy to have the opportunity to ask him a couple of questions.</em></p>



<p><em>The interview took place on September 8</em><sup><em>th</em></sup><em> 2020 in a virtual meeting and lasted around 1.5 hours. Afterwards, I transcribed, shortened and edited the recorded interview. For a brief orientation, here’s an ordered but non-exhaustive list of the topics discussed:</em></p>



<p><em>Why neuroscience?<br />How to get into optics and programming<br />Role models<br />Projects in academia<br />Why didn’t you become a PI?<br />At Scientifica<br />Founding one’s own company<br />Brexit<br />Performance checks for a 2P scope<br />Preamplifiers<br />How to clean optics<br />The detection path<br />Teaching people how to solve problems<br />Mesoscopes<br />mesoSPIM<br />AODs<br />Fixed-wavelength lasers<br />Multiplexed acquisition<br />Scanimage<br />Okinawa<br />Advice to young scientists<br />Bluegrass music<br /><br />If you find any questionable statements, you should consider blaming my editing first.</em></p>



<p><em>And since the entire interview is quite long, take a cup of tea, and take your time to read it</em>…</p>

<p><strong>Peter Rupprecht: </strong>You studied medicine before you started your PhD. What was your motivation to do a PhD in neuroscience, and to continue in neuroscience afterwards?</p>



<p><strong>Bruno Pichler:</strong> This was just something that happened: I really loved the first years of medical school, basic science, physics, biology, anatomy, physiology, and all that. But halfway through medical school when the clinical work started, I realized that it wasn’t for me. So I looked for new inspiration, and I stumbled upon the website of Arthur Konnerth’s lab. I called on a whim and half an hour later I was in his office, and he offered me a job. He said, “why don’t you take a year off from medical school and start working towards a PhD here?” So I worked full-time in the lab for a year, and then went back to finish medical school. But at that point I had no interest in a career in clinical medicine, I just wanted to complete the medical degree and then work in the lab and continue my PhD. – So, not much thought behind it, it’s just how things transpired.</p>

<p><strong>PR:</strong> The medical studies did not really prepare you well for the more technical aspects of what you have been doing afterwards. How did you learn all of this, for example optics, or programming?</p>



<p><strong>BP: </strong>Again, it was just something that happened: there were microscopes that needed troubleshooting, there were things I didn’t understand, and every time I didn’t understand something, I tried to find more information about it. Some of the information sticks with you – and that’s how you learn and how you get into optics and software.<br />For example, there was some custom-written image analysis software in the lab and I didn’t really understand what it did to the data, so I sat down with the guy who wrote it and asked about all the calculations it made and then I cautiously started to make some changes to it, – and it just naturally emerged from there. I never consciously sat down and said, “oh, I want to learn programming!” I had a problem in front of me that I needed to solve, and so I solved it. And whatever I learned while solving it is now part of my knowledge.</p>



<p class="has-blue-color has-text-color" style="font-size: 23px; line-height: 1.1;">“People who inspired me were often those in support roles, like the lab technicians who taught me how to pipette, or the engineers in the electronic and mechanical workshops.”</p>



<p><strong>PR:</strong> So would you describe yourself as a problem-solver?</p>



<p><strong>BP: </strong>I think that is probably an accurate description. My main driving force is that whenever I see a technical problem, I want to find an elegant solution for it. I can’t help it.</p>



<p><strong>PR: </strong>Did you have a role model as a scientist, or somebody who inspired you to continue with neuroscience?</p>



<p><strong>BP: </strong>I definitely have a few people who inspired me, but I wouldn’t say I had a ‘role model’. There’s obviously the intellectual giants like Richard Feynman or Horace Barlow. Then there are the scientists that I worked with, Arthur Konnerth, Tom Mrsic-Flogel, Troy Margrie, and of course all the colleagues in those labs. But, on a very practical level, people who inspired me were often those in support roles, like the lab technicians who taught me how to pipette, or the engineers in the electronic and mechanical workshops. For example, Werner Zeitz, the electronics guy in Arthur Konnerth’s lab, who is known for his famous Zeitz puller (<a href="https://www.zeitz-puller.com/" rel="nofollow">https://www.zeitz-puller.com/</a>). We were building a two-photon resonant scanner with Werner back in 2004/2005, and he built a 19” rack-mountable device box – no labels on it, just unlabeled pots and BNC connectors – which transformed the scanning data into a TV image and sent it to a frame grabber card. Nowadays, we do this in software but it was all done in hardware at the time. Same with the mechanical guy, Dietmar Beyer: He was such a skilled manual machinist, and he would just make whatever we needed without any CNC machining. Another guy that really inspired me back as a PhD student was Yury Kovalchuk. He was a senior postdoc at the time. He knew everything about two-photon microscopy, and he was building an AOD scanner back in 2004/2005. It was the way he understood these systems and explained everything to me whenever I had any questions – those kind of people inspired me.</p>



<p><strong>PR:</strong> From your entire academic career, what was your most rewarding project, big or small?</p>



<p><strong>BP:</strong> That’s so difficult to say, because everything is kind of rewarding. What I can certainly say is that I don’t believe in putting off reward for a long time, and the idea that ‘the more you suffer, the bigger the reward’. I like it when you have smaller rewards, but more frequently.</p>



<p><strong>PR:</strong> I can definitely relate to this… but at least scientific publications usually do not come so frequently. If you have to choose, which scientific publication where you took part in would you like to highlight, and what was your contribution?</p>



<p><strong>BP: </strong>There was a paper in 2012 by Kamilla Angelo in Troy Margrie’s lab (<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3442227/">paper link</a>). I came very late to the party, all the experiments had already been done, the first version of the manuscript had been completed, and Troy just asked me to read it and give some comments. I noticed something in the analysis where the manuscript didn’t actually show unambiguously one aspect of the claim in the paper. We tried to come up with some way to design new experiments to prove that unambiguously, but at some point it occurred to me that you could just do it with the existing data, just with a different type of analysis. And once the idea had come up of doing this pair-wise scrambling of all the data points and then calculating pair-wise differences, it was very quick and easy to write some code to analyze it. And it supported exactly what we thought it would support, but now unambiguously. That felt really rewarding, to be able to nail something that would have otherwise required more experiments with a bit of clever analysis, that was really cool.</p>



<p><strong>PR:</strong> Sounds like that! Especially your PI was probably really happy about this, because it saved a lot of trouble.</p>



<p><strong>BP:</strong> I guess so. The paper would have been highly publishable without my input, but it was just ever so slightly better with my input; and that’s good enough for me.</p>



<p class="has-blue-color has-text-color" style="font-size: 23px; line-height: 1.1;">“I was always more of a Malcolm Young than an Angus Young.”</p>



<p><strong>PR: </strong>Why did you not become a PI yourself?</p>



<p><strong>BP: </strong>Well, to start with, I was never really PI material …</p>



<p><strong>PR:</strong> What would you define as PI material?</p>



<p><strong>BP: </strong>Are you okay with an AC/DC reference? Would you understand what I mean when I say “I was always more of a Malcolm Young than an Angus Young”?</p>



<p><strong>PR: </strong>No, not really …</p>



<p><strong>BP: </strong>Malcolm Young was the rhythm guitarist in AC/DC, he was always in the background and played this steady rhythm, whereas Angus Young is the flamboyant lead guitarist in his school uniform who runs up and down the stage and is the focal point of attention for the audience. When I say “I was always more of a Malcolm Young than an Angus Young”, I’m talking about having a rock-solid line of people in the back who make sure that the lead guitarist and the lead singer can shine: I like to be in that role at the back. As a PI, you have to represent the lab, you have to present your work outside, you have to sell the ideas to funding bodies… so you have to have a little bit more of a flamboyant and outgoing nature. I’m too shy for this, so the PI path was never really on the cards for me to begin with. I was quite happy to be a sort of a medium level scientist – except that I felt there was more I could do to help other people. It felt self-indulgent to just play around with cool technology and have brainy conversations with smart people in the lab. I wanted to provide some value for others.</p>



<p><strong>PR:</strong> And then you chose Scientifica. Why Scientifica? How did that happen?</p>



<p><strong>BP: </strong>I did not really choose Scientifica. I wasn’t actually looking for a job when I left academia. My plan was to go back to the Bavarian Alps and work as a skiing instructor –that’s what I had done before I went to medical school. I figured that it would be really nice to do that again for a season, to pass the time until some new opportunity floated past. And then it just so happened that the opportunity to work at Scientifica floated past earlier than I had anticipated. They rang me and said, “we’ve heard you’re leaving academia and we’re looking for a software person to do some custom stuff for Scientifica’s two-photon customers”, and I was like “well, that sounds like a good idea”, and then I joined Scientifica. There was no job interview, there was no searching for a job, the job found me.</p>



<p><strong>PR:</strong> How was the work like at Scientifica?</p>



<p><strong>BP:</strong> Initially it was mostly intended to be customization of software, for example little Matlab add-ons for Scanimage or stuff like that. But then we also needed a resonant scanning system, and there wasn’t really any software available for resonant scanning before Vidriotech started …</p>



<p><strong>PR:</strong> … and then you wrote SciScan.</p>



<p><strong>BP: </strong>And that’s when I wrote SciScan. I had already written a software for resonant scanning in Labview some years before – for the frame-grabber that we discussed earlier, so I already knew what to do. While writing SciScan I also became involved in the hardware development of the resonant scanner, with the mechanical engineer and the electrical engineer. And so the job role gradually moved towards R&amp;D management.</p>



<p><strong>PR:</strong> I’m a bit younger, so I don’t know whether the resonant scanners always came from Cambridge Technology, or was there a different provider? Or did you build the scanners in-house at Scientifica?</p>



<p><strong>BP: </strong>No, the resonant scanners were always the same as back in 2003 when I first started using them. The manufacturer was originally called General Scanning Inc, then it became GSI Lumonics, which later merged with <a href="https://www.cambridgetechnology.com/">Cambridge Technology</a>, which was then bought by Novanta. There was a number of name changes involved, but no changes to the product.</p>



<p><strong>PR:</strong> Have you tried out resonant scanners from other companies as well?</p>



<p><strong>BP:</strong> I’m only aware of one other resonant scanner that is suitable for what we’re doing and that’s from a company called <a href="http://www.eopc.com/scanners.html">EOPC</a>. I have not actually worked with their resonant scanners yet, but I will be in probably about two weeks from now. We have bought two of their resonant scanners, because they can be synchronized with each other.</p>



<p><strong>PR:</strong> Sounds like a challenging project. Probably with two pulsed lasers?</p>



<p><strong>BP: </strong>No, it’s about temporal multiplexing with a single laser. We want the scanners to run in synchrony so that we can use a single data acquisition system for the two paths.</p>



<p class="has-blue-color has-text-color" style="font-size: 23px; line-height: 1.1;">“When I was a scientist, I was building stuff myself because there wasn’t any company that I could go to and ask them to build it for me. And when I started INSS that was still true.”</p>



<p><strong>PR: </strong>Okay, this makes sense. – After Scientifica, you founded your own company, INSS. What was the biggest challenge when you got started? And why did you found your own company?</p>



<p><strong>BP: </strong>The ‘why’ is very easy to explain: When I started with Scientifica, I was very close to the customers, I was building custom software modules, was interacting with scientists very closely when it came to making hardware modifications to any of the existing products or new suggestions for new hardware products. As the company grew bigger, I got more into a management role. I felt I was getting a little bit too far away from the customer and more involved in managing people and conducting things internally. It is a whole different style of working when you want to make something that is not a prototype but a production item where you want to sell 100 pieces of. Then you have to think more about questions like, how can we design it in a way that you can build it routinely and efficiently, and you have to think about all the supply chain, and build assembly instructions, and how you teach people to do that. There’s a lot of work in the background that is relatively far away from the actual experiment that the neuroscientist is going to do with that microscope and I felt like I wanted to get closer to that again. Also, if you want to sell hundreds of microscopes, it’s not really economically viable to do individual customer specials. From a business development perspective it’s perfectly understandable that Scientifica wanted to have a more standard offering and make off-the-shelf turn-key systems. But that was not so much what I was interested in. I like getting involved in changing things, not making the same thing all the time. I also felt that this sort of very customized, individualized service was not something that was available. When I was a scientist, I was building stuff myself because there wasn’t any company that I could go to and ask them to build it for me. And when I started INSS that was still true. If you’re a scientist you either buy a microscope that someone has designed to fit many purposes, but it may not be perfect for your very specific purpose. And I thought, well, surely there’s a need for modifying, customizing, making something perfect for a particular experiment and stripping out everything else that may not be needed. If you custom-build it from off-the-shelf components, you can save a lot of money. And surely from the money that people save they’d be quite happy to give me some of it, if I advise them how to do it.</p>



<p><strong>PR:</strong> Didn’t it feel like shaky ground when you started? I mean, you were responsible for everything, and you didn’t get a salary anymore.</p>



<p><strong>BP:</strong> I think what helped a lot is that I’ve been involved in the music scene, and I knew a lot of musicians that were self-employed. They were getting money from gigs and teaching and playing on other people’s records and they were making a living without being employed – and I felt I could do the same thing. I had been playing gigs, I knew how to ask a pub owner to pay us money for providing music in the pub. And I figured, conceptually it wouldn’t be much different whether I come to your lab and build something for you, or whether I come to your pub and play a gig for you. You just ask beforehand how much you’re going to get paid for the gig, and if it isn’t enough to cover the costs then you can’t play that gig – it’s not exactly rocket science. It was good that I’d done it for a few years in the music business, it gave me a lot more confidence that this would work out in the microscope consulting business, too.</p>



<p><strong>PR: </strong>INSS is based in the UK. Have you been affected by the Brexit so far, or will you be affected by it?</p>



<p><strong>BP: </strong>I haven’t been affected by Brexit yet, everything is still the same until the end of 2020. Nobody knows what sort of forms we will need to fill in next year, and what sort of new hoops we might need to jump through. I’m not going to start worrying about that now because I don’t know what it’s going to be. – Don’t get me wrong: Brexit will be disastrous on so many levels, especially now, piling onto the coronavirus crisis. And of course it’s also a little bit disappointing… I’ve lived in this country for 13 years and I feel like I made a nice contribution, doing science, paying taxes, playing music. And then all these people feel that someone like me shouldn’t be here because we’re a burden on the country and they’d rather pull up the drawbridge; and they think it’s worth taking all these economic consequences of a no-deal Brexit just to keep people like me out of their country. But if that’s what the majority voted for, then I just have to deal with this somehow. I’m reasonably optimistic that I’ll find some way to navigate these new circumstances!</p>



<p><strong>PR:</strong> I get the impression that you are quite optimistic in general. Do you think this is a requirement for being self-employed?</p>



<p><strong>BP: </strong>I think it’s probably a requirement if you don’t want to live a life in misery. You have to be somewhat optimistic or at least relaxed about what the future might hold because the future is kind of uncertain. You’re not going to know what’s going to happen. If you worry about it, it will not change the fact that the future is uncertain. So you might as well say “I’ll jump down that bridge when I get there”.</p>



<p><strong>PR:</strong> If you don’t mind, let’s talk about some technical questions … after you set up a two-photon microscope in somebody’s lab, how do you quickly check its performance? Do you have a specific routine?</p>



<p><strong>BP: </strong>The quickest performance check is to image a pollen grain slide. You check how the spiky pollen grains look like, whether you can section them nicely and how the field of view [FOV] is like. Once you’ve done it a few times, it is everything you need to get a quick qualitative idea of whether everything is working fine. If you want to do it more quantitatively then you obviously want to image beads, you want to check your field flatness, you want to get your precise FOV measurements with some grids, and so on. We have a routine that we’re working with that we constantly improve, but in the majority of cases that’s not even necessary.</p>



<p><strong>PR:</strong> I think there are some companies which sell special calibration slides or samples. When would this be useful, or do you think it is overkill?</p>



<p><strong>BP:</strong> I would love to use those, but they are not really suitable for 2P. You are talking about the Argolight probes?</p>



<p><strong>PR:</strong> Yes…</p>



<p><strong>BP:</strong> So, they specifically mention that you shouldn’t be using them with 2P, or you use them at your own risk. Also, they cost about 8’000 euros. I don’t really want to spend 8’000 euros on something where I can quickly exceed the damage threshold, and that’s why I haven’t used them. I would love to have something like that if it’s available for two photon. In the meantime, I’ll stick with these electron microscopy grids and beads and pollen grains. – What are your thoughts on those, have you tried anything like that?</p>



<p><strong>PR: </strong>Several years ago I also wanted to check the field curvature for a two-photon microscope and borrowed a quite expensive calibration slide from the confocal microscopy facility, but I managed to destroy it, and that’s when I stopped experimenting. Usually, I just use beads and fluorescent plastic slides. Not so much pollen grains, because I have destroyed the slides several times.</p>



<p><strong>BP: </strong><em>(curious) </em>How do you destroy a pollen grain slide?</p>



<p><strong>PR:</strong> Just by leaving the slide somewhere in the setup, until something makes the glass break; which happened to me twice so far. I also made some simple pollen samples in agar, but that’s not possible in winter or autumn. So I’m usually sticking to beads. But in principle I agree, pollen slides are ideal, you quickly find the samples and you can also check how the fluorescence yield changes across the FOV. Do you make your own pollen grain slides?</p>



<p><strong>BP:</strong> We’re using pollen slides from Carolina Biological Supply Company. They make these ready-made pollen grain slides for schools and educational settings and the slide is like five dollars or something.</p>



<p><strong>PR:</strong> I didn’t know they were so cheap! The first scanning confocal microscope that I used [a Leica SP5] had come with a pollen slide, and I had been instructed to treat the slide very carefully, because it was so expensive… So it’s good to know that it can be really cheap! – Just another question about two-photon microscopes: which preamplifier would you recommend for a standard resonant scanning two-photon microscope?</p>



<p><strong>BP:</strong> We often use the Thorlabs preamps, the TIA60, and we also use the Thorlabs PMTs with the built-in preamps, which is quite convenient. You control them through USB, and you can set the amplifier bandwidth in software.</p>



<p><strong>PR: </strong>I thought the bandwidth was fixed at 60 MHz?</p>



<p><strong>BP:</strong> Yes, for the TIA60 preamps, it’s fixed at 60 MHz. For the PMTs with the built-in preamplifiers, you can choose between, I think, 80 MHz, 2.5 MHz and 200 kHz. When we need higher bandwidth for something, then we would use Femto preamps.</p>



<p><strong>PR:</strong> Which one is your preferred preamp from Femto?</p>



<p><strong>BP: </strong>I use the 400 MHz one.</p>



<p class="has-blue-color has-text-color" style="font-size: 23px; line-height: 1.1;">“For me, cleaning always starts with these little rubber ball dust blowers.”</p>



<p><strong>PR:</strong> Let’s talk about objectives… If you were postdoc in a lab and could choose any objective for testing, which one would you choose?</p>



<p><strong>BP:</strong> I had a Nikon 25x NA1.1 when I was in Troy’s lab, and that’s a really nice objective. For the typical applications I was working at – population calcium imaging – that’s just a beautiful objective. I wouldn’t really need to try anything else. I’m sure there are other applications that would benefit from some of these newer Olympus long working distance objectives, but it’s so application specific, and there’s good uses for all of them. So, without having a particular experiment in mind, it would be difficult to answer the question.</p>



<p><strong>PR:</strong> For these Olympus objectives, I think the working distance is something like 4 or 8 mm. Does the 8 mm make any sense for neuroscience applications?</p>



<p><strong>BP:</strong> Again, it depends on your application, right? These objectives were primarily designed for cleared brains, where you don’t have much of a choice, you either use a long working distance or you’re not imaging all of it.</p>



<p><strong>PR:</strong> Ok, I didn’t know that it was for designed for cleared brains. Now, this makes much more sense to me. – Speaking about objectives, how do you usually clean optical elements? Do you use tap water or distilled water, or can you recommend any other protocols?</p>



<p><strong>BP:</strong> For me, cleaning always starts with these little rubber ball dust blowers. You just try to blow everything off that might be there. If that doesn’t work with the blower, you get out the compressed air can. From there, we’ll go to distilled water, and then Purosol. If I can’t get it off with that, I would go to isopropyl alcohol, and then to methanol. But we’re usually dealing with new microscopes, so in the vast majority of cases, we don’t have to go past the compressed air can.</p>



<p><strong>PR: </strong>What do you do with dichroics if they’re dirty or if there’s sticky dust on top of them? Is there anything you can do?</p>



<p><strong>BP:</strong> I wouldn’t really want to go far beyond the distilled water on a dichroic. If I can’t get it off with that, I might try the Purosol, but we don’t encounter dirty dichroics very often, because most of the optics we’re working with are brand new.</p>



<p><strong>PR: </strong>Another question about 2P microscopes: I was always wondering about a proper way to test the alignment and performance of collection optics. How do you check whether collection optics are properly aligned?</p>



<p><strong>BP:</strong> I want to capture all the light that’s coming out of the back aperture of the objective. So, if you just put some light source and a diffuser under the objective – that can be the LED on a phone with a bit of lens tissue on top as a diffuser –, you’ll get a large cone of light coming out the back aperture. Then you screw in a little target at the position where your PMT will be sitting. You should see a spot right in the center that has the size of the PMT sensor.</p>



<p><strong>PR:</strong> Just to repeat, it’s important to remove the PMT in this case, right?</p>



<p><strong>BP:</strong> Yes, you need to remove the PMT and put a target in its place. If you want to do it more quantitatively, it gets difficult. You could use a calibrated light source and count how many photons you get through and compare that over many microscopes and so on. But I don’t think anyone is doing that in practice.</p>



<p class="has-blue-color has-text-color" style="font-size: 23px; line-height: 1.1;">“I don’t want to tell someone how to align a laser, I rather want to be present when they figure it out themselves.”</p>



<p><strong>PR: </strong>Let’s assume a customer writes to you that there’s a problem with their two-photon system, “because the signal becomes weaker”. This is something I also often hear from less experienced colleagues or friends who ask for some help with their setup. What would be your first guess if you don’t know anything else?</p>



<p><strong>BP:</strong> In the first instance I would think of it as a great opportunity to help someone to think systematically about the problem. Because if all they tell me is that “the signal becomes weaker”, then they haven’t really thought about how to communicate a problem in such a way that the other person can do something with it. I would need to know so much more , for example: what’s the signal? what’s the system? what are you measuring? have you done the same experiment over a year, and every day it gets a little bit weaker?, or is that happening within the same animal, or within the same slice? … there’s a thousand different questions. I need to find out what the person means by “signal”, what the person means by “becomes”, what they mean by “weaker”. It’ll be beneficial for that person, and for me, if I can teach them how to clarify their thoughts to themselves, and then communicate them efficiently. Maybe next time they know immediately why it’s becoming weaker simply because they’ve changed the way they think.<br />I have to say that I enjoy it very much to help someone to clarify to themselves what the problem is. It’s very rewarding for the person to figure out the problem by themselves, and it’s rewarding for me to teach someone a problem-solving skill that they might not have had before.</p>



<p><strong>PR: </strong>I think you have also participated in some summer schools?</p>



<p><strong>BP: </strong>That’s right, I’ve been at the <a href="https://meetings.cshl.edu/courses.aspx?course=C-IMAG&amp;year=19">Cold Spring Harbor imaging course</a> five times – which is great fun, a great location and great teachers. I’m also participating every year at <a href="https://www.tenss.ro/">TENSS</a> in Romania, the Transylvanian Experimental Neuroscience Summer School, again a great team of people that are running it with great lecturers and great spirit among students and all the TAs and lecturers. I really enjoy teaching people and helping them to figure things out. I don’t want to tell someone how to align a laser, I rather want to be present when they figure it out themselves. I might nudge them in the right direction, but if I simply told them what to do, I feel I’d be depriving them of a joyful moment of revelation.</p>



<p><strong>PR: </strong>It can also be a bit dangerous to align laser beams, and especially invisible IR beams. To make the laser beam visible, do you use IR viewers?</p>



<p><strong>BP:</strong> I use them occasionally, but only when I have to, so only when I’m working with a fixed-wavelength laser. And even then I try to do as much as I can with viewing cards rather than the viewer itself. Although I tend to go back and forth a little bit between card and viewer.</p>



<p><strong>PR:</strong> For the tunable lasers, do you switch to visible wavelengths or what do you think about the pointing stability of those lasers?</p>



<p><strong>BP:</strong> I usually align everything in the visible range and then, once we switch to IR, I image a uniform slide and check if our alignment is nice and centered. The illumination on the slide tells you whether you’ve gone off a little bit.</p>



<p><strong>PR:</strong> To clarify, I was thinking more about pointing stability when changing the wavelength of the tunable laser for example from 700 nm to 900 nm…</p>



<p><strong>BP:</strong> I don’t think the changes are drastic. But we’re doing the final alignment through the actual scan head based on what we’re seeing on the computer screen from the fluorescent slide, and we’re doing that at 900 or 930 nm anyway. In that sense, the visible beam is only a first approximation.</p>



<p><strong>PR:</strong> But this also means that you have to be quite tall, because otherwise you cannot reach the adjustment screws of the mirrors and at the same time look at the screen to check the fluorescence of the slide…</p>



<p><strong>BP: </strong>Well, you need some access to those screws and a clear visual path to the computer monitor. You can walk around the table and do it from the back, as long as you can see the computer screen, right?</p>



<p><strong>PR: </strong>Yes… probably I was just thinking about some situations in the past where I tried to do this myself and needed to stretch quite far to reach the adjustment screw and at the same time look around the corner to see the screen …</p>



<p><strong>BP:</strong> Have you tried moving the screen?</p>



<p><strong>PR:</strong> Not really … okay, I think you’ve identified the problem, it’s just laziness from my side! – But one more question about objectives: what do you think about two-photon mesoscopes with FOVs of several millimeters? Are they more difficult to build or maintain? Do you think they will become more standard or is it just a trend?</p>



<p><strong>BP: </strong>It completely depends on the application. If there are experiments that you can’t do with a standard FOV microscope, you need a wide FOV microscope. If you want to image two areas simultaneously with cellular resolution that are too far apart for a normal FOV, you don’t really have that much of a choice. A microscope like that is certainly more difficult to build, because you need custom optics for it, which are really expensive, and that is something that will prevent them from becoming really standard in every lab very soon. A lot of experiments don’t require such large FOV microscopes.</p>



<p><strong>PR: </strong>So you don’t think that these objectives or lenses will become much cheaper in the future and allow them to become more standard?</p>



<p><strong>BP:</strong> I don’t think they’ll go down in price very much. And they’re also difficult to maintain, and you need custom pre-chirpers. You basically need a dedicated imaging engineer in the lab who’s maintaining those microscopes, and even if you buy it commercially, for example the <a href="https://www.thorlabs.com/newgrouppage9.cfm?objectgroup_id=10646">2P RAM mesoscope</a> from Thorlabs, you need someone who’s working with that microscope every day to monitor its performance and fine tune it and so on and so forth. I hope that we’ll see a few more mesoscopes popping up in the future, because there are very interesting questions that you can answer with them, and maybe the prices will come down a little bit. But I don’t think they’ll come down far enough for it to be a standard thing that everyone has.</p>



<p class="has-blue-color has-text-color" style="font-size: 23px; line-height: 1.1;">“I wouldn’t be surprised if a three-photon microscope is on the cards at some point. We haven’t done it yet, but if someone asks, I’ll be happy to build one.”</p>



<p><strong>PR: </strong>Do you also have any experience with setting up confocal microscopes or light-sheet microscopes and, if yes, how is this different from setting up two-photon microscopes?</p>



<p><strong>BP: </strong>I have not set up a confocal microscope so far, but I have set up a mesoSPIM light sheet microscope that your colleague Fabian [Voigt] in Fritjof [Helmchen]’s lab has designed. It was a very different experience in the sense that this was probably the first time that we’ve built something where we had basically no input in the design, and we were following someone else’s instructions. That was a little bit daunting, simply because I’d never done it before, but Fabian’s documentation is just so excellent that it turned out to be not a problem at all, and in that sense it was not much different to what we usually do when building a two-photon.</p>



<p><strong>PR:</strong> Do you also have any plans of building a three-photon microscope?</p>



<p><strong>BP:</strong> I’m going to build whatever people ask me to build. We’ve done a lot of 2p microscopes, but we’ve also built wide-field microscopes, we’ve built a mesoSPIM, we’re working on a microscope for in-situ sequencing, I’ve helped people with LabView coding. Whatever it is that people ask me, if I have time to do it and it sounds interesting, I’ll do it. And I wouldn’t be surprised if a three-photon microscope is on the cards at some point. We haven’t done it yet, but if someone asks, I’ll be happy to build one.</p>



<p><strong>PR:</strong> So, even if I gave you a lot of money to make you build a 3D AOD-based two-photon scanning microscope, would you give it a try? I’ve heard that it is extremely challenging to make this run stably.</p>



<p><strong>BP: </strong>I would certainly try it – and get the right people involved. I was actually a co-author on an AOD paper some ten years ago with people from Angus Silver’s lab. AOD systems are a little bit finicky, but with the right person, with the right project, with the right collaborators on board, I don’t see why someone who wants an AOD system shouldn’t attempt to build one. I’m sure that some of these teething problems that any new technology always has will be ironed out over the next few years</p>



<p><strong>PR: </strong>So you’re quite optimistic about the future role of AOD scopes for two-photon microscopy?</p>



<p><strong>BP: </strong>For the right applications – yes.</p>



<p><strong>PR: </strong>As we mentioned you also provide your service in order to help your customers save costs. If a lab really wants to save money, would you recommend to buy a fixed-wavelength laser for two-photon microscopy? I’m also not sure whether there are already some 920 nanometer lasers around …</p>



<p><strong>BP: </strong>There are now a few manufacturers that build fixed wavelength 920 nanometer lasers, and if someone says, all I’m going do with this microscope for the next three or four years is GCaMP imaging and I just want to have a workhorse for that, then that’s certainly a good option. If it’s a young lab that only has a single two-photon microscope in the lab, and they don’t know exactly what sort of projects might come along next year and what sort of dyes they might be using next year, then it’s a bit of a risk to bet all your money on a single wavelength. This is probably more something for labs that have another two-photon with a tunable laser, where they can do experiments in the red or where they can explore other dyes that aren’t excitable at 920 nm.</p>



<p><strong>PR:</strong> Do you have examples for companies which sell fixed wavelength lasers at 920 nm?</p>



<p><strong>BP:</strong> Coherent are selling one now, the <a href="https://www.coherent.com/lasers/laser/axon">Axon 920</a>; Spark Lasers have <a href="https://spark-lasers.com/compact-femtosecond-laser-biophotonics-alcor/">a few options</a> for 920 nm; there’s Menlo, a company in Munich that sells the <a href="https://www.menlosystems.com/products/femtosecond-lasers-and-amplifiers/ylmo930/">Ylmo-930</a>; Toptica have a <a href="https://www.toptica.com/products/psfs-fiber-lasers/femtofiber-ultra/femtofiber-ultra-920/">920 model</a>, also <a href="https://www.nktphotonics.com/lasers-fibers/product-category/koheras-single-frequency-lasers/">NKT Photonics</a> – there’s quite a few around now. I haven’t actually tried any of them yet, but it’s certainly going in a direction where we’ll be seeing these more often in the field.</p>



<p><strong>PR:</strong> Another technical question – you mentioned it already: what’s your opinion on multiplexed acquisition? Will it remain a niche product like the mesoscopes, or do you think it will become much more standard?</p>



<p><strong>BP:</strong> Again it depends completely on your application … if you want to image two areas simultaneously without having to jump between them – whether that’s on a mesoscope where you image two different brain areas that are millimeters apart, or whether you want to image a single neuron and you want to image soma and spines both with very zoomed-in resolutions, but without having to jump between them – then multiplexed acquisition can be the right technique. If you don’t have the right question for multiplexed acquisition, then there’s no point getting it. All of these things are only useful in a very particular context that depends on the scientific question that you want to answer.</p>



<p><strong>PR:</strong> I always thought that multiplexed acquisition might be particularly difficult to implement because it’s not only challenging in terms of hardware and optical alignment, but also the software to disentangle the two multiplexed photon streams is not trivial. I was thinking that this combination of both hardware and software challenges might be a bottleneck which prevents many people from doing it?</p>



<p><strong>BP: </strong>Well… you can also de-multiplex the channels in hardware using an analog system. Spencer Smith and Jeffrey Stirman used a nice system in their 2016 Nature Biotechnology paper with a wide FOV (<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27347754/">paper link</a>), where they actually had an analog photon-counting system and then just acquired with a standard data acquisition system. They didn’t need to change anything in software because all the photon counting was done in the analog domain. But now, with these gigahertz data acquisition systems, you can acquire the data fast enough, get the laser timing and then assign different acquisition time bins to different channels. Scanimage can do that now, so it’s not really a challenge any more.</p>



<p><strong>PR:</strong> Do you have an opinion about the new <a href="https://vidriotechnologies.com/vdaq/">vDAQ</a> system of Scanimage? I think it’s not based on National Instruments hardware any more.</p>



<p><strong>BP:</strong> We’ve built a couple of microscopes with those systems, and they seem very nice, very user-friendly. There’s no obvious downside, although I haven’t had a chance to really observe them over the same time periods as I have with National Instruments for over 20 years. But I have very high hopes for these systems, and we’re using them as standard now. The only situation where we’re not using them at the moment is when we have to count photons, because the data acquisition speed is currently 125 MHz max on the vDAQ. But there will be a new vDAQ version coming out later this year, with high-speed acquisition that will then be suitable for photon counting.</p>

<p><strong>PR:</strong> I see. Maybe, to finish up, some fun questions… or maybe not so much fun, let’s see. During your time at INSS, what was your most challenging project?</p>



<p><strong>BP: </strong>One of the first microscopes we built was in Okinawa, Japan. Shipping all the microscope parts to Okinawa was a bit of a challenge. Three of the four boxes arrived without problem, but the box with my toolkit didn’t arrive and was completely lost for about a week or so. UPS didn’t know where it was. They had scanned it in Tokyo, but then lost track of it and had absolutely no idea where it was. I had to fly to Okinawa to build a microscope, but I didn’t know whether my toolkit would be there, too. I had lots of spare parts in the toolkit, and all sorts of specialist tools that were difficult to replace in the shortness of time. That was a challenge to my otherwise unshakable optimism … In the end, the toolkit did arrive and everything was fine; I built the microscope, no problem with that. But then I needed to ship the toolkit back, and UPS kept cancelling the booking and no one on the customer service hotline knew why. We eventually shipped it back with Fedex. It was all very annoying, and I then decided to get a shipping agent who’s now managing all of our shipping for us, and he’s been brilliant.</p>



<p><strong>PR: </strong>Okay, this sounds like a rough start…</p>



<p><strong>BP: </strong>Yes … having these useful conversations with UPS customer service … It makes my blood boil just thinking about it.</p>



<p><strong>PR: </strong>What was the most expensive device you destroyed by accident?</p>



<p><strong>BP: </strong>I don’t really know, I don’t remember.</p>



<p><strong>PR:</strong> You never destroyed an objective?</p>



<p><strong>BP:</strong> I never destroyed an objective, never destroyed a laser; I’ve destroyed scan mirrors, ETLs, stuff like that, probably a few other items in that price range. But I move on from that pretty quickly. I always think of it as a tuition fee that I have to pay, and then I forget about the incident. But the knowledge of what not to do stays with me.</p>



<p><strong>PR: </strong>Which skill do you wish you have learned earlier that would be of use for your current job?</p>



<p><strong>BP: </strong>Hm, all of them! I would love to have university degrees in electronic engineering and optical physics and project management, computer science, business administration, and applied math. Almost every technical thing or business thing that you could learn at a university would be in some way useful to my current job. But I also have to be realistic about how much I can do with the available time. These disciplines have crossed my path sort of superficially, and I’ve picked up what I can. I wish I had a really solid foundation in all of them, but I have to live with my limitations.</p>



<p><strong>PR: </strong>This sounds quite modest, given your expertise in so many domains… if you had to pick one, what would you learn if you had one year for that?</p>



<p><strong>BP:</strong> Probably math. I’d really like to go back to undergraduate level math and learn all the foundations properly.</p>



<p><strong>PR:</strong> From your long experience in research and as a consultant, what kind of advice would you give to students or postdocs who want to learn the skills which are needed to understand a microscope or, more generally, to set up experiments?</p>



<p><strong>BP:</strong> You just have to start, just go and do it. If you want to set up a microscope, go online, google “how to set up a microscope”, and then click your way to the websites where you can find how to set up a microscope. Maybe someone recommends to go to a course, maybe someone recommends a particular Youtube video. You’ll find all the resources that you need. This is such a great time to be alive, because you can find everything that you need online. You can apply for courses like the CSHL course that we discussed about, or TENSS, or numerous other imaging courses. If you don’t get into any of those courses, you can still learn it all online and just start building. A lot of people now offer very simple 3D-printed parts to set up basic optics and teach yourself the skills. You don’t even have to wait until you’re a student or a postdoc, you can do that as a little school project when you’re 12 years old, because all the learning resources are online.</p>



<p class="has-blue-color has-text-color" style="font-size: 23px; line-height: 1.1;">“I would recommend to stop thinking about a career. I would recommend to think about just getting better and better at whatever it is that floats your boat.”</p>



<p><strong>PR: </strong>So you would encourage self-learning, because that’s the way to learn what you have learned yourself?</p>



<p><strong>BP: </strong>It’s one way that works for me. Other people have different working styles, and your own working style emerges when you start doing something.</p>



<p><strong>PR:</strong> What would be your advice for young scientists like PhD candidates or postdocs who think about a career like yours?</p>



<p><strong>BP: </strong>I would recommend to stop thinking about a career. I would recommend to think about just getting better and better at whatever it is that floats your boat; if you work more like an artist or an artisan and just focus on improving whatever your chosen art or your chosen craft is, then you’re going to get good at it, and then you’ll enjoy doing it. And if you keep an open mind, intriguing opportunities will pop up. And if you pursue these opportunities whenever they present themselves, then you’ll end up with the very tortuous career trajectory that I have, that doesn’t seem to make any obvious sense from outside. But for me, internally, it had a very natural flow. You’re obviously also going to need a massive amount of good luck; but I don’t really have any advice on how to get lucky.</p>



<p>On a side note, for anyone who’s considering starting their own business or doing something on their own, there’s an old blog post written by a banjo player called Danny Barnes. He writes about how to make a living by playing music (<a href="https://dannybarnes.com/blog/how-make-living-playing-music">https://dannybarnes.com/blog/how-make-living-playing-music</a>), and while the blog post is ostensibly about music, there’s a lot of advice that applies to any self-employed person, not just musicians; and also not just to self-employed people, it applies to anyone who is in some way in a largely self-directed job – which I guess is the case for most scientists. There are a few paragraphs in there that are more specific to music, but I think it’s just a very good read on how you want to conduct business and life with other people and make a living from it.</p>



<p><strong>PR:</strong> I’m curious, and I’ll check it out! … I think it has become obvious by now that you’re a big music aficionado. On Twitter, you describe yourself, among others, as ‘Bluegrass Dobroist’. Could you explain this to somebody without any clue, like myself?</p>



<p><strong>BP: </strong>A Dobro is an American instrument, it’s like an acoustic guitar that has an aluminium resonator cone built into the body. Originally, it was invented to make a normal guitar louder, a bit like a speaker cone that picks up the vibrations from the strings and projects them outward. The Dobro was invented in the 1920s to make the guitar <em>a little bit</em> louder to be heard over orchestras, and it was kind of popular for a few years, until someone invented an electric guitar that you could just very easily make <em>a lot</em> louder, and then the Dobro fell into obscurity. It’s played in a lap style, and you’re not fretting the strings with your fingers like on a normal guitar, but you use a steel bar that slides up and down the strings.</p>



<p><em>(Since I did not fully understand the following explanations, he pulls out a Dobro and simply shows to me via video how it works to play a Dobro.)</em></p>



<p><strong>PR: </strong>And what is the meaning of ‘bluegrass’?</p>



<p><strong>BP:</strong> Bluegrass originally comes from the American state of Kentucky. Kentucky has a certain type of grass that has a sort of a blue appearance, and that’s why Kentucky is called the bluegrass state. There was a band in the 1940s that came from Kentucky; the band leader was called Bill Monroe and this band was called the Bluegrass Boys. Bill Monroe and the Bluegrass Boys played a very new and unique style of acoustic country music, and then other people started copying that style, and eventually because of the name of the band the style became known as Bluegrass music, and that evolved into a whole genre of music. Now, there’s tons of bluegrass bands, and bluegrass music, bluegrass festivals, and there’s a Grammy for bluegrass music. So, from this one band in the 1940s a very huge branch of music has emerged.</p>

<p><strong>PR: </strong>Interesting, I didn’t know that.</p>



<p><strong>BP:</strong> I’ll be most happy to talk a lot more about bluegrass music all day long! I love it – I’ve been really involved in this scene for the last 12 years or so, going to festivals almost every weekend – obviously not now with the pandemic, and generally a little less since I started the company and since we had a baby two years ago. I’ve got a lot of other things to do now, but I’m still very much connected to the whole music scene and to the guys in the band and all that. Sometimes during the time when I worked at Scientifica, I was playing five, six, seven gigs a month even though I was living here in East Sussex and drove an hour and a half or two hours into London after work to play gigs and come back during the night to be back at Scientifica in the morning…</p>



<p><strong>PR: </strong>At the end, is there anything else you want to share?</p>



<p><strong>BP: </strong>I want to give a quick shout-out to my team, Angelos, Eleanor, Mark and Simon, who are just a massive pleasure to work with.<br />Other than that, if people want any sort of clarification on the things that I’ve mentioned, if people are thinking about transitioning from academia to industry and there are questions popping up, send me an email or hit me up on twitter and I’ll be quite happy to answer questions and give advice!</p>



<p><strong>PR: </strong>Thank you. I think you gave already a lot of good advice here!</p>



<p><strong>BP:</strong> I’m glad to hear that.</p>



<p><strong>PR: </strong>Thank you very much.</p>

<p>The arXiv development team is pleased to announce a major release of the arXiv TeX compilation system, which is based on the official <a href="https://www.tug.org/texlive/">TeX Live 2020</a> update. <a href="https://arxiv.org/help/tex">TeX</a> is an open source markup language that allows precision formatting of various aspects of academic writing, including mathematical formulas and bibliographies.</p>
<p>This update, set to release on October 1, 2020, provides enhanced local add-ons and support for newer font sets. The development team also used this opportunity to address bugs and feature requests and further modernize how the compilation system is packaged and run. arXiv’s previous major release was based on TeX Live 2016.</p>
<p>Authors should be aware that works submitted between now and September 30, 2020 must adhere to current arXiv TeX guidelines (<a href="https://arxiv.org/help/submit_tex">here</a> and <a href="https://arxiv.org/help/faq/#tex">here</a>). Works prepared in accordance with <a href="https://www.tug.org/texlive/">TeX Live 2020</a> are welcome starting after 8am EDT on October 1, 2020.</p>
<p>arXiv accepts more than ten thousand articles every month, and continues to provide access to all arXiv papers since the service was founded in 1991. A stable TeX compilation system is critical to reprocess articles from TeX sources from any point in time. arXiv maintains all past TeX trees so that existing papers are processed using the TeX tree that was in place when the article was originally submitted. This preserves the original presentation of the article.</p>
<p><a href="https://arxiv.org/help/faq/whytex">TeX has many advantages</a> that make it ideal for the archives: it is plain text, compact, and freely available for all platforms, and it also produces high-quality output.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coronavirus-covid-19-brazil-city-manaus-herd-immunity">A Brazilian city devastated by COVID-19 may have reached herd immunity</a></h4>

<p>The Brazilian city of Manaus was hit hard by COVID-19. At the peak of its epidemic in late spring, the city of over 2 million people had 4.5 times as many deaths as expected for that time of year. Hospitals and cemeteries struggled to keep up, and mass graves were dug to bury the dead. But then, cases and deaths steadily declined, despite a relaxing of social distancing measures. </p>



<p>That trajectory has prompted some researchers to suggest that Manaus has reached herd immunity. In a report posted September 21 at medRxiv.org that has yet to be peer reviewed, researchers suggest that herd immunity developed in the city after <a href="https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.09.16.20194787v1">44 to 52 percent of the population was infected</a> at the epidemic’s peak, and that slowed subsequent spread of the virus.</p>



<p>“These are the highest [infection] levels I’ve seen,” says Elitza Theel, a clinical microbiologist at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minn., who wasn’t involved in the study. That high infection rate may very well have impacted the trajectory of the epidemic. “That is how herd immunity works,” she says. “But it comes at a high cost … their death rate was very high.”</p>



<p><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/covid-19-when-will-coronavirus-pandemic-social-distancing-end">Herd immunity</a> occurs when enough people become immune to an infectious disease, either through infection or a vaccine, causing an epidemic to slow down as the pathogen is starved of susceptible hosts (<em>SN: 3/24/20</em>). Scientists are still working out what the herd immunity threshold would be for COVID-19; most estimates are around 40 to 60 percent of a population.</p>

<p>The precise threshold likely varies from region to region, but virtually all of the globe remains well below this threshold, experts say. Most of the United States remains in the single digits, though around 20 percent of the population in parts of New York City may have already contracted the virus.</p>



<p>To investigate whether herd immunity developed in Manaus, researchers from Brazil and the United Kingdom turned to blood donations, looking for antibodies to SARS-CoV-2, the coronavirus that causes COVID-19. Blood donations aren’t a random sample of the population. They tend to come from healthy, asymptomatic adults, and so could miss infections in older people who may be more vulnerable to infection, as well as in kids. Still, the donations offer a way to measure seroprevalence, the proportion of a population that’s been exposed to a virus and has developed antibodies against it.</p>



<p>Researchers tested about 800 to 1,000 blood donations each month from February to August, and attempted to control for potential confounding factors, such as the sensitivity of different tests and the fact that <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/covid-19-coronavirus-what-antibody-tests-tell-us">antibodies can wane over time</a> (<em>SN: 4/28/20</em>). They also tested blood donations from São Paolo, another Brazilian city. “This is one of the best papers that I’ve seen that really does try to account waning antibody levels over time” and other factors, Theel says.</p>



<p>In Manaus, the prevalence of antibodies to the coronavirus in blood donors hovered below 1 percent early on in the pandemic, the team found. In April, it rose to 4.8 percent and then rocketed to 44.2 percent in May and reached a peak of 51.8 percent in June, a trajectory that roughly followed the curve of accumulating deaths.</p>

<h4>
<a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/editors-picks/2019-novel-coronavirus-outbreak">See all our coverage of the coronavirus outbreak</a>
</h4>
</aside>



<p>After that peak, seroprevalence fell, reaching 30 percent in August, a consequence of both waning antibody levels in people already infected and lower transmission rates, the researchers say.</p>



<p>While social distancing measures probably helped slow the spread of the virus, the team argues that high population immunity played a bigger role in curbing the epidemic. As of August, the researchers estimate 66 percent of the population had been infected. Whether the city will avoid another outbreak remains to be seen, and will depend in part on how long protective immunity lasts.</p>



<p>The researchers warn that their findings can’t be directly translated to other cites because of differences in factors such as demographics, behavior and adherence to social distancing measures.</p>



<p>Why Manaus reached herd immunity when other cities haven’t remains unclear. São Paolo for instance, a bustling city of over 12 million, never topped 14 percent seroprevalence despite both cities implementing similar social distancing measures, the analyzed blood donations show. The study authors point to Manaus’ lower socioeconomic conditions, more crowded housing and reliance on boat travel, as factors that could have accelerated the spread of the virus there.</p>



<p>The researchers estimate close to 4,000 people died from COVID-19 in Manaus, a high death toll for a city where only <a href="https://cidades.ibge.gov.br/brasil/am/manaus/pesquisa/23/25888?detalhes=true">6 percent of the population is over 60</a>. The city had an infection fatality rate between 0.17 and 0.28 percent, the study suggests. The costs of reaching herd immunity via infection in other cities, especially where there are more older people could be much, much higher. Estimates of São Paolo’s infection fatality rate range as high as 0.72 percent.</p>



<p>Overall, Manaus’ experience reveals “that an unmitigated outbreak will lead to very significant morbidity and mortality,” says Bill Hanage, an epidemiologist at Harvard University, “which is basically what we’ve been saying since February.”</p>

<p><em>By</em> <a href="https://twitter.com/mattbwarren">Matthew Warren</a></p>



<p>Imagine that you are a high-achieving student at a school which, overall, doesn’t perform that well. You know that your grades are better than most of your peers’, so you probably rate your academic ability quite high. You are, in other words, a big fish in a small pond. </p>



<p>Now you transfer to a school in which the other students consistently get top marks, perhaps even better than yours. You’re now the small fish in a big pond, and although your own ability has remained the same, you begin to doubt yourself and actually rate yourself lower than you had before.</p>



<p>This “big-fish-little-pond” effect shows that our academic self-concept can be profoundly shaped by how we compare ourselves to our peers. Now a <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/1948550620956535">study in<em> Social Psychological and Personality Science</em></a> has found that the size of this comparison matters: the effect is even more pronounced when people are <em>extremely</em> high achieving in very low ranked groups, or vice-versa.</p>


<p><span id="more-40380"></span></p>


<p>It might seem obvious that when people make more extreme comparisons with their peers, their self-evaluations should receive more of a boost (or take more of a hit, depending on the direction of that comparison). But as Ethan Zell and Tara Lesick from the University of North Carolina note in their new paper, no-one had actually looked into this.</p>



<p>In the first study, the pair asked 187 people to complete a verbal reasoning test which involved completing sentences. Participants were then told that the same task had been completed by other students from their own university, as well as students from 39 other universities.</p>



<p>Participants received different information about how they had done relative to their peers at their university, and how well their university scored compared to the other institutions. There were four conditions: <em>big-fish-little-pond</em> (participants did better than 65% of peers; university ranked better than 35% of other institutions);<em> little-fish-big-pond</em> (participants did better than 35% of their peers; university ranked better than 65% of others); <em>huge-fish-tiny-pond</em> (participants did better than 85% of peers; university ranked above just 15% of others); and <em>tiny-fish-huge-pond</em> (participants did better than only 15% of peers; university outranked 85% of others).</p>



<p>Participants then rated their own verbal ability and performance on the test. As expected, big fish in little ponds — i.e. those who read that they were somewhat above average in a somewhat below average group — gave themselves better self-evaluations than little fish in big ponds. But this effect was accentuated for the other two conditions: huge fish in tiny ponds — i.e. those who read that they were <em>far</em> above average in a <em>far</em> below average group — rated themselves as even better than big fish. Tiny fish in huge ponds rated themselves as even worse than little fish.</p>



<p>In a subsequent study, the team looked at what happened to this effect when people also received information about their overall level of performance. This is important because in a group that is far above average, someone who scores well below average <em>for that group</em> could still have a pretty good objective performance. </p>



<p>In this study, some participants in the huge-fish-tiny-pond condition were told they had done better than 35% of all American test-takers, while some in the tiny-fish-huge-pond condition were told they had done better than 65% of Americans.  This meant that participants in the huge-fish-tiny-pond group were 30 percentile points lower than those in the tiny-fish-huge-pond group. And yet, the effect still occurred (albeit at a smaller scale): they rated their abilities as higher than those in the latter group.</p>



<p>Finally, the researchers found evidence that this effect is driven by people focussing on their own rank within a group, rather than on how their group compares to others. Participants ranked extremely highly in their group rated their abilities as high no matter whether the group was itself of high or low rank. Similarly, those who ranked low in their group rated their ability as low, regardless of their group’s rank.</p>



<p>Overall the work shows that even if you are a member of an elite group, it can be demoralising to learn that you are a “tiny fish” who is performing worse than your peers, the authors write. Further work is needed to see whether this effect extends to real-world situations, and explore what its repercussions are for people’s career and study choices.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/life-earth-origins-hostile-hot-springs-microbes">Life on Earth may have begun in hostile hot springs</a></h4>

<p>At Bumpass Hell in California’s Lassen Volcanic National Park, the ground is literally boiling, and the aroma of rotten eggs fills the air. Gas bubbles rise through puddles of mud, producing goopy popping sounds. Jets of scorching-hot steam blast from vents in the earth. The fearsome site was named for the cowboy Kendall Bumpass, who in 1865 got too close and stepped through the thin crust. Boiling, acidic water burned his leg so badly that it had to be amputated.</p>



<p>Some scientists contend that <a href="https://www.liebertpub.com/doi/10.1089/ast.2019.2045">life on our planet arose in such seemingly inhospitable conditions</a>. Long before creatures roamed the Earth, hot springs like Bumpass Hell may have promoted chemical reactions that linked together simple molecules in a first step toward complexity. Other scientists, however, place the starting point for Earth’s life underwater, at the deep hydrothermal vents where heated, mineral-rich water billows from cracks in the ocean floor.</p>



<p>As researchers study and debate where and how life on Earth first ignited, their findings offer an important bonus. Understanding the origins of life on this planet could offer hints about where to search for life elsewhere, says Natalie Batalha, an astrophysicist at the University of California, Santa Cruz. “It has very significant implications for the future of space exploration.” Chemist Wenonah Vercoutere agrees. “The rules of physics are the same throughout the whole universe,” says Vercoutere, of NASA’s Ames Research Center in Moffett Field, Calif. “So what is there to say that the rules of biology do not also carry through and are in place and active in the whole universe?”</p>

<h4>Lure of the land</h4>



<p>At its biochemical core, the recipe for life relies on only a few ingredients: chemical elements, water or other media where chemical reactions can occur and an energy source to power those reactions. On Earth, all of those ingredients exist at terrestrial hot springs, home to some hardy creatures. Great Boiling Spring in Nevada, for example, is a scalding 77° Celsius, yet <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/ncomms10476">microbes manage to eke out an existence in water</a> near the spring’s clay banks, researchers reported in 2016 in <em>Nature Communications</em>. Such conditions may reflect what it was like on early Earth, so these life-forms are most likely “related to some of the organisms that were originally on this planet,” says Jennifer Pett-Ridge, a microbial ecologist at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory in California.</p>





<p>Microorganisms at hot springs can form communities called microbial mats. Made up of layers of microbes, mats have been found in geothermal areas all over the world, including in Yellowstone National Park, the Garga hot spring in southern Russia and Lassen — home to Bumpass Hell.</p>



<p>Over time, microbial mats can form into stromatolites, structures of microbes and minerals that have accumulated on top of one another; the layered appearance of a stromatolite reflects the passage of time, like a tree’s growth rings. Researchers found <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/ncomms15263">evidence of stromatolites in the Dresser Formation</a>, a 3.5-billion–year-old rock feature in the Western Australia outback, along with evidence of hot spring mineral deposits, describing the findings in 2017 in <em>Nature Communications</em>. These findings, plus other signs of past microbes, led the team to suggest that some of the earliest life on Earth flourished in a hot spring environment.</p>



<p>David Deamer, a biophysicist at UC Santa Cruz, has spent four and a half decades exploring how life on our planet may have begun. He started out studying lipids, oily molecules that make up the membranes surrounding cells. Deamer, a big proponent of hot springs as the source of life’s start, has shown that conditions at terrestrial hot springs can produce bubblelike vesicles, with an outer layer made up of lipids. Such structures may have been <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/life-scratch-0">the ancestral precursors of modern-day cells</a> (<em>SN: 7/3/10, p. 22</em>).</p>



<p>Bruce Damer, an astrobiologist at UC Santa Cruz who brings a computer science approach to questions about the origins of life, worked with Deamer to test whether conditions at hot springs could drive condensation reactions, which join two molecules into one larger composite.</p>



<p>When water splashes out of a hot spring and evaporates, molecules that were in the liquid could undergo condensation reactions and link up. A subsequent splash would add more molecules that could undergo additional condensation reactions as liquid dries again. Repeated rounds of wetting and drying could produce chains of molecules.</p>



<p>In 2018, Damer set up shop at an active geothermal area in New Zealand, named along the usual theme — Hells Gate — to test that hypothesis. He prepared vials with ingredients needed to assemble strands of RNA, a nucleic acid that acts as a messenger during protein synthesis and may have <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/quite-switch">catalyzed chemical reactions involved in the origins of life on early Earth</a> (<em>SN: 4/10/04, p. 232</em>). The concoction included two of the four RNA building blocks — the nucleotides that link together to form RNA chains.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="alignright size-full"><img alt="" class="wp-image-3091427" src="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/092620_life-start_inline-4_680.jpg" /><span class="caption wp-caption-3091427">In February, astrobiologists Bruce Damer and Luke Steller (shown) performed wet-dry cycling experiments in acidic hot spring pools at Hells Gate in New Zealand.</span><span class="credit wp-credit-3091427">B. Damer</span></figure></div>



<p>Damer stood the open vials in a metal block, roughly the size of two CD cases stacked together, and set the contraption into a near-boiling hydrothermal pool. To simulate the sometimes-wet, sometimes-dry burbling of the primordial Earth, Damer squirted acidic hot spring water into the vials, let them dry out and then repeated the wet-dry cycle several more times. When he brought the vials back to the lab, he found that they contained RNA-like strands that were 100 to 200 nucleotides long.</p>



<p>These results, reported in December 2019 in <em>Astrobiology</em>, indicate that <a href="https://www.liebertpub.com/doi/abs/10.1089/ast.2018.1979">complex molecules can form at hot springs</a>, supporting the hypothesis that life on Earth may have developed in such an environment. In 2020, Damer returned to Hells Gate with Deamer and colleagues to confirm Damer’s results and do more wet-dry cycling studies.</p>



<p>Nicholas Hud, a chemist at Georgia Tech in Atlanta, studies the origins of life from a slightly different perspective: He explores how DNA and RNA nucleotides originated. He agrees that molecules are more likely to link together by condensation reactions on land, where wet-dry cycles can occur, than in the ocean. These reactions produce water; the formation of such a chemical bond isn’t energetically favorable when there’s already a lot of water around. “The best place to form that is in a hot, dry place,” Hud says. “The worst place to form it is in a wet, hot place.”</p>

<h4>Underwater visions</h4>



<p>Yet, wet, hot environs are just the place for life to originate, other evidence suggests. At <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/deep-sea-hydrothermal-vents-more-abundant-thought">hydrothermal vents on the deep, dark ocean floor</a>, heated water spews into seawater that’s just a few degrees Celsius above freezing (<em>SN: 7/23/16, p. 8</em>).</p>



<p>In 2017, researchers found fossils in 3.77-billion-year-old rocks from Quebec that originated from the ancient ocean floor and had signs of hydrothermal activity (<em>SN: 4/1/17, p. 6</em>). The researchers claim that the <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/oldest-microfossils-suggest-life-thrived-earth-about-4-billion-years-ago">distinct structures resemble those of microbes</a>, suggesting that deep-sea environments may have supported some of the earliest life on Earth.</p>



<p>These environments can be extreme: Some vents belch dark plumes of water as hot as 400° C. However, if vents played a role in nurturing early forms of life, it likely happened at milder vents. For example, Lost City is a hydrothermal area in the middle of the Atlantic Ocean where the fluid streaming from vents ranges in temperature from 40° to 90° C. The region is named for dramatic limestone chimneys that rise as much as 60 meters above the seafloor.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img alt="a photo of a limestone chimney" class="wp-image-3091431" src="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/092620_life-start_inline-7_1030.jpg" /><span class="caption wp-caption-3091431">The chemistry of vents like the limestone chimneys found at the Atlantic Ocean’s Lost City supports microbial life.</span><span class="credit wp-credit-3091431">Courtesy of Susan Lang/Univ. of S. Carolina, NSF, ROV Jason/2018 © Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution</span></figure>



<p>These spires are home to microbes that feed off the products of a chemical reaction known as serpentinization. “Hydrothermal vents are interesting because they are at the interface of water and rock,” says astrophysicist Laurie Barge of NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, Calif.</p>



<p>A chemical reaction between water and rock at sites like Lost City makes the water coming out of vents more alkaline than the water in the ocean, which has a higher concentration of positively charged hydrogen ions. The resulting gradient from alkaline to more acidic water is like the difference between the positive and negative ends of a battery and can serve as an energy source for chemical activity.</p>



<p>To study the conditions at underwater vents, Barge creates simulated environments in the lab that, she says, “can mimic what you see in the natural world.” To represent an ocean on early Earth, she fills an inverted glass bottle with an acidic mixture containing iron but no oxygen. One end of a plastic tube pokes through the narrow end of the bottle, connected to a steady supply of a basic, or alkaline, solution just like a vent.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="alignright size-full"><img alt="a still photo of a simulated alkaline hydrothermal vent" class="wp-image-3091428" src="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/092620_life-start_inline-5_680.jpg" /><span class="caption wp-caption-3091428">NASA’s Laurie Barge simulates an alkaline hydrothermal vent in an acidic ocean to explore the chemistry of ancient oceans. The conditions produce chimney structures like the one above. </span><span class="credit wp-credit-3091428">JPL-Caltech/NASA</span></figure></div>



<p>When Barge and colleagues injected an alkaline vent solution containing RNA nucleotides into an ocean-simulating bottle, <a href="https://www.liebertpub.com/doi/10.1089/ast.2014.1280">individual RNA nucleotides linked up into short chains</a>. These strands were only three or four nucleotides long, but the results suggest that the conditions at deep-sea vents could have supported reactions that led to the emergence of life on Earth, the researchers proposed in 2015 in <em>Astrobiology</em>.</p>



<h4>Problems with both</h4>



<p>To Deamer, there are big barriers to putting life’s pieces together near underwater vents: The vastness of the ocean would dilute molecules so they wouldn’t be concentrated enough to drive chemical reactions. Also, there are “no wet-dry cycles underwater.” In his view, repeated evaporation is needed to pull together enough molecules to bump into each other and react to form longer chains. Plus, unlike a hot spring’s freshwater, salty ocean water inhibits the formation of membranes and reactions that link together molecules, he says.</p>



<p>However, Deamer’s hot springs theory has its critics as well. DNA and RNA strands are composed of alternating phosphate and sugar molecules, but sugars “are profoundly unstable in hot spring environments,” says David Des Marais, an astrobiologist at NASA’s Ames Research Center.</p>



<p>And it may be too soon to rule out wet-dry cycles underwater. “You can have a little bit of water get stuck in a pore,” says Bill Brazelton, a marine microbiologist at the University of Utah in Salt Lake City. And then, because the serpentinization reaction at a vent uses up water in making other molecules, “you can have these cycles of dehydration inside a rock underneath the ocean.”</p>



<p>It may be impossible to nail down how life truly began on Earth: Most geologic records of what actually happened during Earth’s earliest days have long disappeared. There are numerous alternative hypotheses for where life began, beyond terrestrial hot springs and deep-sea vents. Recent research, for example, suggests that <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/chicxulub-collision-earth-crust-hot-water-microbes-million-years">asteroid impacts could have sent superheated seawater into the crust</a> to produce hydrothermal systems resembling hot springs (<em>SN: 7/4/20, p. 10</em>).</p>



<p>“I think we have to admit that there might be more than one little torturous path that might have been traversed in order for life to begin,” Des Marais says.</p>

<h4>Life beyond Earth</h4>



<p>Researchers are using what they’ve learned about how and where life may have originated on Earth to guide the search for biological signatures beyond our planet. There are several promising locales in our solar system.</p>



<p>“One of the things that NASA is really interested in knowing is whether or not there could be life in the subsurface oceans of the icy moons, like Europa and Enceladus,” says Batalha, of UC Santa Cruz. Scientists have evidence that the two moons, one orbiting Jupiter and the other, Saturn, have <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/table-salt-europa-jupiter-moon-underground-sea">oceans of salty, liquid water beneath their icy shells</a> (<em>SN Online: 6/14/19</em>).</p>



<p>These moons are intriguing because, along with liquid water, both have <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/another-hint-europa-watery-plumes-found-20-year-old-galileo-data">plumes of water erupting from their surfaces</a> (<em>SN: 6/9/18, p. 11</em>), suggesting ongoing hydrothermal activity. NASA’s Cassini space probe even identified compounds containing carbon, nitrogen and oxygen within Enceladus’ plumes, some of the ingredients of amino acids, the building blocks of proteins. Europa and Enceladus fascinate astronomers because activity on their ocean floors may <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/somethings-cooking-enceladus">resemble the hydrothermal vents found on our own planet</a> and may provide the chemical conditions to support life (<em>SN: 4/18/15, p. 10</em>).</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="plumes of water vapor seen above Enceladus" class="wp-image-3091432" src="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/092620_life-start_inline-8_1030-800x421.jpg" /><span class="caption wp-caption-3091432">Plumes of water vapor, plus compounds containing carbon, nitrogen and oxygen, spew from the frozen surface of Enceladus, a moon of Saturn, as captured by NASA’s Cassini spacecraft. Hydrogen in the plumes is evidence of hydrothermal activity in the ocean beneath the ice, similar to deep-sea vents on Earth.</span><span class="credit wp-credit-3091432">JPL-Caltech/NASA, Space Science Institute, Planetary Science Institute</span></figure>



<p>Icy moons may also promote condensation reactions. “Even if you were on an icy moon, you might have … freezing and thawing of ice,” Barge says. “So, I think it’s important to say, if wet-dry cycling is important, then we should look for any environment in the solar system that might be able to promote oscillating conditions of dehydration.”</p>



<p>But to find signs of past life, Damer and Deamer believe Mars is a more promising place to look. Mineral deposits indicate the presence of hot springs and hydrothermal activity in the planet’s past, which would have sustained the wetting and drying cycles that the two researchers see as crucial for condensation reactions to get life going.</p>



<p>Missions to the Red Planet are already under way. NASA’s Perseverance rover will be <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/nasa-perseverance-rover-mars-instruments-life">searching for signs of ancient life</a>, such as telltale minerals in rock samples, at Mars’ Jezero crater when the mission lands in February 2021 (<em>SN: 7/4/20 &amp; 7/18/20, p. 30</em>). Though at least 54.6 million kilometers separate them, Mars and Bumpass Hell may not be so different.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/cuviers-beaked-whale-longest-record-dive">A beaked whale’s nearly four-hour-long dive sets a new record</a></h4>

<p>To break the record for longest dive by a marine mammal, take a deep breath and jump in the water. Then don’t breathe in again for almost four hours.</p>



<p>Cuvier’s beaked whales (<em>Ziphius cavirostris) </em>are <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/beaked-whales-may-frequent-seabed-spot-marked-mining">master divers</a> (<em>SN: 08/21/18</em>). The creatures not only hold the record for deepest plunge by a marine mammal — measuring nearly 3,000 meters — but  also for the longest dives. In 2014, scientists documented one dive that lasted just over two hours at 137.5 minutes, setting <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0092633">a record</a>. Another Cuvier’s beaked whale has now shattered that record, going <a href="https://jeb.biologists.org/content/223/18/jeb222109">222 minutes</a>, or three hours and 42 minutes, without coming up for air, researchers report September 23 in the <em>Journal of Experimental Biology</em>.  </p>



<p>To last so long underwater, the mammals may rely on large stores of oxygen and a slow metabolism. Once oxygen runs out, the animals may have the ability to tolerate lactic acid building up in their muscles from anaerobic respiration — a method of generating energy that doesn’t rely on oxygen. “These guys blow our expectations,” says Nicola Quick, an animal behaviorist at Duke University Marine Laboratory in Beaufort, N.C.</p>



<p>Calculations based on a seal’s oxygen stores and diving time limits hinted that the whales should last only about half an hour before running out of oxygen. Seals can exceed their limit about 5 percent of the time, so Quick’s team analyzed 3,680 dives by 23 whales. While most dives lasted around an hour, 5 percent exceeded about 78 minutes, suggesting it takes more than twice as long as thought for the whales to switch to anaerobic respiration.</p>



<p>The researchers expected to find that the whales spend more time at the surface recovering after long dives, but the team did not see a clear pattern. “We know very little about [the whales] at all,” Quick says, “which is interesting and frustrating at once.”</p>

                <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/global-warming-practically-irreversible-antarctic-melting">Global warming may lead to practically irreversible Antarctic melting</a></h4>

<p>How is melting a continent-sized ice sheet like stirring milk into coffee? Both are, for all practical purposes, irreversible.</p>



<p>In a new study published in the Sept. 24 <em>Nature</em>, researchers outline <a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-020-2727-5" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">a series of temperature-related tipping points</a> for the Antarctic Ice Sheet. Once each tipping point is reached, changes to the ice sheet and subsequent melting can’t be truly reversed, even if temperatures drop back down to current levels, the scientists say.</p>



<p>The full mass of ice sitting on top of Antarctica holds enough water to create about 58 meters of sea level rise. Although the ice sheet won’t fully collapse tomorrow or even in the next century, Antarctic <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/antarctica-lost-3-trillion-metric-tons-ice-since-1992-sea-level-rise">ice loss is accelerating</a> (<em>SN: 6/13/18</em>). So scientists are keen to understand the processes by which such a collapse might occur.</p>



<p>“What we’re really interested in is the long-term stability” of the ice, says Ricarda Winkelmann, a climate scientist at Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research in Germany. In the new study, Winkelmann and her colleagues simulated how future temperature increases can lead to changes across Antarctica in the interplay between ice, oceans, atmosphere and land.</p>





<p>In addition to direct melting due to warming, numerous processes linked to climate change can speed up overall melting, called positive feedbacks, or slow it down, known as negative feedbacks.</p>



<p>For example, as the tops of the ice sheets slowly melt down to lower elevations, the air around them becomes progressively warmer, speeding up melting. Warming temperatures also soften the ice itself, so that it slides more quickly toward the sea. And ocean waters that have absorbed heat from the atmosphere can transfer that heat to the <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/antarctica-thwaites-glacier-warm-water-sea-level-climate">vulnerable underbellies of Antarctic glaciers</a> jutting into the sea, eating away at the buttresses of ice that keep the glaciers from sliding into the sea (<em>SN: 9/11/20</em>). The West Antarctic Ice Sheet is particularly vulnerable to such ocean interactions — but warm waters are also threatening sections of the East Antarctic Ice Sheet, such as <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/wind-may-be-driving-melting-east-antarctica-totten-glacier">Totten Glacier</a> (<em>SN: 11/1/17</em>).</p>



<p>In addition to these positive feedbacks, climate change can produce some negative feedbacks that delay the loss of ice. For example, warmer atmospheric temperatures also evaporate more ocean water, adding moisture to the air and producing <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/greenland-antarctica-are-gaining-ice-inland-losing-melting-overall">increased snowfall</a> (<em>SN: 4/30/20</em>).</p>



<p>The new study suggests that below 1 degree Celsius of warming relative to preindustrial times, increased snowfall slightly increases the mass of ice on the continent, briefly outpacing overall losses. But that’s where the good news ends. Simulations suggest that after about 2 degrees Celsius of warming, the West Antarctic Ice Sheet will become unstable and collapse, primarily due to its interactions with warm ocean waters, increasing sea levels by more than 2 meters. That’s a warming target that the signatories to the 2015 Paris Agreement pledged not to exceed, but which <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/united-nations-climate-report-finds-countries-urgently-need-reduce-emissions">the world is on track to surpass</a> by 2100 (<em>SN: 11/26/2019</em>).</p>



<p>As the planet continues to warm, some East Antarctic glaciers will follow suit. At 6 degrees Celsius of warming, “we reach a point where surface processes become dominant,” Winkelmann says. In other words, the ice surface is now at low enough elevation to accelerate melting. Between 6 and 9 degrees of warming, more than 70 percent of the total ice mass in Antarctica is loss, corresponding to an eventual sea level rise of more than 40 meters, the team found.</p>



<p>Those losses in ice can’t be regained, even if temperatures return to preindustrial levels, the study suggests. The simulations indicate that for the West Antarctic Ice Sheet to regrow to its modern extent, temperatures would need to drop to at least 1 degree Celsius below preindustrial times.</p>



<p>“What we lose might be lost forever,” Winkelmann says.</p>



<p>There are other possible feedback mechanisms, both positive and negative, that weren’t included in these simulations, Winklemann adds — either because the mechanisms are negligible or because their impacts aren’t yet well understood. These include interactions with ocean-climate patterns such as the El Niño Southern Oscillation and with ocean circulation patterns, including the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation.</p>



<p>Previous research suggested that meltwater from the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets might <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-019-0889-9">also play complicated feedback roles</a>. Nicholas Golledge, a climate scientist with Victoria University of Wellington in New Zealand, reported in <em>Nature</em> in 2019 that flows of Greenland meltwater can slow ocean circulation in the Atlantic, while cold, fresh Antarctic meltwater can act like a seal on the surface ocean around the continent, trapping warmer, saltier waters below, where they can continue to eat away at the underbelly of glaciers.</p>



<p>In a separate study published Sept. 23 in <em>Science Advances</em>, Shaina Sadai, a climate scientist at the University of Massachusetts Amherst, and her colleagues also examined the impact of Antarctic meltwater. In simulations that look out to the year 2250, the researchers found that in addition to a cool meltwater layer trapping warm water below it, that surface layer of freshwater would exert a strong cooling effect that could boost the volume of sea ice around Antarctica, which would in turn also keep the air there colder.</p>



<p>A large plug of such meltwater, such as due to the West Antarctic Ice Sheet’s sudden collapse, could even briefly <a href="https://advances.sciencemag.org/lookup/doi/10.1126/sciadv.%20eaaz1169">slow global warming</a>, the researchers found. But that boon would come at a terrible price: rapid sea level rise, Sadai says. “This is not good news,” she adds. “We do not want a delayed surface temperature rise at the cost of coastal communities.”</p>



<p>Because the volume and impact of meltwater is still uncertain, Winkelmann’s team didn’t include this factor. Robert DeConto, an atmospheric scientist also at the University of Massachusetts Amherst and a coauthor on the <em>Science Advances</em> study, notes that the effect depends on how scientists choose to simulate how the ice breaks apart. The study’s large meltwater volumes are the result of a controversial idea known as the <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/ice-sheets-collapse-sea-level-rise-climate-change">marine ice-cliff hypothesis</a>, which suggests that in a few centuries, tall ice cliffs in Antarctica might become brittle enough to suddenly crumble into the ocean like dominoes, raising sea levels catastrophically (<em>SN: 2/6/19</em>).</p>



<p>Despite lingering uncertainties over the magnitude of feedbacks, one emerging theme — highlighted by the <em>Nature</em> paper — is consistent, DeConto says: Once the ice is lost, we can’t go back.</p>



<p>“Even if we get our act together and reduce emissions dramatically, we will have already put a lot of heat into the ocean,” he adds. For ice to begin to grow back, “we’ll have to go back to a climate that’s colder than at the beginning of the Industrial Revolution, sort of like the next ice age. And that’s sobering.”</p>

                <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/mother-mouse-gut-microbes-microbiome-pup-brain">A mother mouse’s gut microbes help wire her pup’s brain</a></h4>

<p>New findings in mice suggest yet another role for gut microbes, even before birth.</p>



<p>The microbes residing in a female mouse’s gut <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2745-3">help shape the wiring of her offspring’s brain</a>, researchers report September 23 in <em>Nature. </em>While mouse and human development are worlds apart, the study hints at how a mother’s microbiome may have long-term consequences for her offspring.</p>



<p>Scientists have previously found links between a mouse mother’s microbiome and her young’s brain and behavior, but many of those studies worked with <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/vaginal-microbes-mice-transfer-stress-their-pups">animals that were stressed</a> (<em>SN: 7/9/18</em>) or sick. Instead, Helen Vuong, a neurobiologist at UCLA, and her colleagues looked at what a mother’s microbial mix normally does for her pups’ brains.</p>



<p>The new results point to the influence of specific microbes and the small molecules they produce, called metabolites. “Metabolites from the microbiome of the mother can influence the developing brain of the fetus,” says Cathryn Nagler, an immunologist at the University of Chicago who was not involved with the study. The metabolites do this by reaching a developing pup’s brain where they affect the growth of axons, she says. Axons are the threadlike signal-transmitters of nerve cells.</p>





<p>Vuong and her team looked at the brains of fetuses from pregnant mice — some with their usual gut bugs, some raised without microbes and others ridded of their gut bacteria with antibiotics. When a mother’s microbes were missing, fetuses had shorter and fewer axons extending from the brain’s “relay station” to the cortex, Vuong says. These connections are important for processing sensory information.</p>



<p>Those brain differences appear to have consequences for mice later in life. As adults, mice born to microbe-deficient mothers were less sensitive to touch than mice from mothers with a typical microbiome. For instance, in one of several sensory tests, mice from microbe-deficient mothers took longer to notice a small piece of tape stuck to one of their paws. But when microbe-lacking females were given <em>Clostridia</em> bacteria, their offspring’s brain and behavior developed normally. <em>Clostridia</em> are common gut microbes in humans and in mice, Nagler says, and their absence has been linked to some noncommunicable conditions, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/gut-bacteria-may-prevent-food-allergies">such as food allergies</a> (<em>SN: 8/26/14</em>).</p>



<p>Small molecules made by the gut bugs may account for this effect. The researchers found that levels of several metabolites in mom’s blood were linked to levels in the fetal blood and brain. “It’s kind of cool that it’s crossing different sites from the mom all the way to the fetus,” Vuong says. That suggests mom shares her gut metabolites with her young.</p>



<p>When pregnant mice with altered microbiomes received supplements of some of those metabolites, their pups’ behavior developed normally. It’s not clear yet how gut microbes and metabolites could be involved in human brain development. Still, this “points now to a way that one might think about intervening,” if pregnant women have deficient microbiomes, says Nagler, who is president of ClostraBio, a company that’s exploring metabolite treatments for diseases related to the immune system. Instead of trying to alter those microbiomes, which can be difficult, pregnant women could receive the needed metabolites directly.</p>



<p>“It will be really important to understand whether these negative effects also happen in humans and whether they lead to long-term medical concerns,” says Carolina Tropini, a microbiologist and biomedical engineer at the University of British Columbia in Vancouver who was not part of the work. Researchers will need to study how the short-term benefits of antibiotics stack up against potential risks, she says, but such research may also lead to therapies for pregnant women who need antibiotics.</p>

<p>Astrophysicists have gotten their first direct view of a supermassive black hole’s appearance changing over time. </p>



<p>The black hole at the center of the galaxy M87, about 55 million light-years away from Earth, was the <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/black-hole-first-picture-event-horizon-telescope">first black hole to get its picture taken</a> (<em>SN: 4/10/19</em>). That image, created using Event Horizon Telescope data from April 2017, showed a lopsided ring of light: the black hole’s shadow on the accretion disk of hot, glowing plasma swirling into it. A new comparison of that image with earlier Event Horizon Telescope data reveals that the <a href="https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/abac0d">brightest spot on the ring changes location</a>, due to turbulence in the violent eddy of material around the black hole, researchers report online September 23 in the <em>Astrophysical Journal</em>.</p>



<p>“It’s a very exciting result,” says astrophysicist Clifford Will of the University of Florida in Gainesville, who was not involved in the study. “The first image that they produced was just a snapshot. What we would really like to do is understand more of the dynamics of what’s going on at the center of that galaxy.”</p>



<p>The Event Horizon Telescope, or EHT, is a <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/event-horizon-telescope-black-hole-picture">network of radio telescopes</a> that, together, make much higher resolution observations than any observatory could alone (<em>SN: 4/10/19</em>). An early version of the EHT began observing M87’s black hole, dubbed M87*, in 2009. Back then, the network included telescopes at only three sites in Arizona, Hawaii and California. In 2013, an observatory in Chile joined the team. But the network did not have enough telescopes to create a complete black hole image until 2017, when the EHT peered at M87* with seven observatories across North America, South America, Hawaii and Europe.</p>





<p>Using the 2017 image of M87* as a starting point for the black hole’s appearance, along with preliminary data from 2009 to 2013 to fill in some of the details, the EHT team was able to get a rough idea of what M87* looked like during the early years of EHT observation.</p>



<p>Although the black hole’s diameter remained the same, the brightest spot on the ring swiveled. The ring’s right side was brightest in 2013, while the bottom was brightest in 2017. “I think many people in the [EHT] collaboration were surprised by the amount of variability,” says EHT team member Maciek Wielgus, an astrophysicist at Harvard University. The ring’s uneven glimmer arises from the tumultuous flow of superhot plasma around the black hole.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img alt="M87 black hole timeline" class="wp-image-3091698" src="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/092220_MT_m87_inline-680.jpg" /><span class="caption wp-caption-3091698">Preliminary Event Horizon Telescope data reveal how the brightest spot on the ring of light around M87’s black hole shifts over time. Researchers compared the real image (far right), created from observations taken in 2017, with simulations of what the black hole looked like earlier based on preliminary data from 2009 to 2013. The changes are due to turbulence in the tempest of material swirling into the black hole.</span><span class="credit wp-credit-3091698">M. Wielgus, D. Pesce</span></figure>



<p>This turbulence in the accretion disk — and therefore the variation in the ring’s appearance — is expected to depend on factors like <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/spin-may-reveal-black-hole-history">how fast the black hole is spinning</a>, the tilt of its rotation and the strength of its magnetic fields, says astrophysicist Priyamvada Natarajan of Yale University, who was not involved in the study (<em>SN: 1/30/17</em>). Monitoring changes in M87*’s appearance may reveal new information about the nature of the black hole.</p>



<p>The new results show the promise of using the EHT to probe the tempest around M87*, says Harvard University astrophysicist Avi Loeb, who was not involved in the work. But the rough sketches of the black hole’s appearance from 2009 to 2013 do not contain enough information to draw firm conclusions about what is going on in this chaotic region, he says.</p>



<p>The EHT team will need more full images of M87*, like the one created from 2017 data, to uncover detailed changes over time. That series of still images could also be used to <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/black-hole-image-event-horizon-telescope-top-science-stories-2019-yir">create an M87* movie</a> (<em>SN: 12/16/19</em>).</p>



<p>The EHT team is currently analyzing data collected in 2018, including observations from a newcomer to the EHT network, the Greenland Telescope. The EHT <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/first-black-hole-image-event-horizon-telescope-coronavirus">did not observe in 2019 or 2020</a>, but “we will be observing in 2021, COVID permitting,” says EHT team member Geoffrey Bower, an astrophysicist at the Academia Sinica Institute of Astronomy and Astrophysics in Hilo, Hawaii (<em>SN: 4/10/20</em>). “We expect to have incredible imaging quality out of those 2021 data,” he says, because by then the EHT will have two more eyes on the sky: the Kitt Peak observatory in Arizona and the NOEMA array in the French Alps. “I think that’s really going to get at the heart of turbulence in the accretion region,” he says.</p>

<p><em>By</em> <a href="https://emmayoung.net/">Emma Young</a></p>



<p>We all know that it’s vital that we take action to reduce the harm we do to the environment. So understanding the barriers to such action is critical, too. A <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/0146167220948712">new paper</a>, published in <em>Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin</em>, identifies a potentially important one: when people believe that it’s important to protect the environment, they’re less likely to act on those beliefs if they’re more religious.</p>


<p><span id="more-40369"></span></p>


<p>Kimin Eom at Singapore Management University and colleagues studied Americans — and when they talk about people being “religious”, they’re really talking about being Christian. These caveats are important to highlight up front.</p>



<p>In the first of three studies, the team analysed pre-existing data on a nationally representative sample of 3,052 US adults. They looked specifically at answers to three categories of questions. Firstly, questions assessed how strongly an individual endorsed the ideas that a) the world is getting hotter; and b) human activity is an important driver of this. Secondly, questions related to “religiosity” — a) their belief in the importance of religion; and b) how often they attend religious services. Finally, the team looked at responses to questions that assessed their level of support for pro-environmental policies.</p>



<p>The researchers found that climate change beliefs predicted support for pro-environmental policy less strongly among individuals higher in religiosity. In other words, “These results supported the idea that environmental beliefs are less in line with pro-environmental support among those who are more, relative to less, religious.” These results held even when team took into account/controlled for a range of demographic variables, including political orientation, gender, income, education, age and ethnicity.</p>



<p>In a second study, the team dug deeper into this finding. A total of 424 US students, half from a Christian college and half from a non-religious public university, both in California, completed a series of questionnaires. The first scale explored the extent to which they believed in climate change. The second measured religiosity. The third measured how strongly the participants believed in a “controlling god” — a god who has a plan and controls events in the world. They were then asked to report how often they would perform six environmentally friendly behaviours (such as buying green products instead of regular products and unplugging appliances at night) over the next six months.</p>



<p>The participants also gave demographic data — and a few potentially important differences between the groups stood out. Namely, the Christian college students were more likely to be Republican and there were fewer women in the Christian group. The team took these group differences into account in their analysis, which revealed that higher religiosity was associated with a stronger belief in a controlling god — and it was the strength of this belief (rather than religiosity per se) that affected their intentions to act in a more environmentally friendly way. (Those with the strongest beliefs in a controlling god were the least likely to indicate that they’d be engaging in such behaviours.)</p>



<p>Why should this be the case? The authors argue that, if you believe that a god controls what happens in the world, you are less likely to think that any actions that you take will change any given outcome — and so you are less likely to change your behaviour.</p>



<p>The results from these studies were correlational, however. To explore the idea that belief in a controlling god makes people less likely to act to help the environment, the team ran a third study with 730 Christians. The team measured their environmental beliefs as before. Half then read a passage that described God as the ultimate controller of the world. This was designed to prime them with the idea that God is controlling. The other read an article about why Pluto had been declassified as a planet (a text chosen to have no influence on attitudes to God). Participants also rated the extent to which four adjectives (controlling, commanding, caring, compassionate ) described a god. Next, their intentions to behave in a pro-environmental way were assessed (as in the previous study) and they provided demographic data.</p>



<p>Climate change beliefs predicted intentions to behave pro-environmentally less strongly when a participant had a stronger concept of God as being controlling. Or to put it another way, believing in a controlling god “weakens the association between environmental beliefs and pro-environmental support”. This study confirms that it’s the belief in a controlling god, rather than a belief in God per se, that weakens that association, the team argues.</p>



<p>As already noted, though, the religious people in this study were Christians, and they were all American. So the findings may or may not extend to people with other religious beliefs. Also, these studies featured a lot of self-report and assessments of “intention” to act. It would of course be interesting to know whether belief in a controlling god makes any difference to actual, real world behaviour.</p>



<p>However, as the researchers also point out, when it comes to understanding which sociocultural factors influence environmental attitudes and behaviour, there is still a lot to learn. This work at least starts to plug part of that gap.  </p>

                <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/early-immune-responses-young-people-covid19-coronavirus">Early immune responses may be why younger people get less sick from COVID-19</a></h4>

<p>One of the lingering questions of the pandemic is why COVID-19 symptoms tend to be milder in children and young adults than in older people. A new study suggests that the immune systems of people younger than 24 deal the coronavirus a strong first punch. Those early immune defenses, which set off alarm bells for the body to go on the attack no matter what the invader, may be weaker in older adults.</p>



<p>Having more muted frontline defenses could allow an infection with SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, get a foothold, resulting in <a href="https://stm.sciencemag.org/content/early/2020/09/21/scitranslmed.abd5487">worse symptoms for older people</a>, researchers report September 21 in <em>Science Translational Medicine</em>.</p>



<p>The results add to evidence that boosting early immune responses to the virus with a vaccine or drugs like <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/covid-19-coronavirus-immune-system-early-treatment-interferon">interferons</a> — which are based on proteins the body produces to stimulate immune cells — could help protect people (<em>SN: 8/6/20</em>).</p>



<p>Researchers have had some ideas why younger people generally get less sick. It’s possible that compared with adults and older kids, younger children have <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/covid-19-coronavirus-kids-schools-opening-when-how-risks">lower amounts of the ACE2 protein</a> in their upper respiratory tracts. That’s a protein that the virus uses to break into cells (<em>SN: 8/4/20</em>). Another explanation could have been that young people have less virus in their bodies, which could mean milder symptoms, although studies have shown that viral load is similar across people no matter their age. Or differences in the immune system, which tends to become less robust with age, could play a role.</p>

<p>In the new study, pediatric infectious diseases physician and virologist Betsy Herold and colleagues divided 125 COVID-19 patients hospitalized at Montefiore Medical Center in New York City into five categories. People younger than 24 were split into three groups: those with symptoms who did not need a ventilator, those that did need ventilation and a third group that included kids who developed a <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coronavirus-covid-19-kids-parents-summer">coronavirus-related inflammatory syndrome</a> that mainly affects children younger than 5 (<em>SN:6/3/20</em>). Adult patients older than 24 fell into two groups: people who needed a ventilator or died and those who recovered.</p>



<p>When the team compared the immune responses among groups, it found that younger people, including those with the inflammatory syndrome, had higher amounts of an immune signaling molecule called IL-17A than older adults. That protein is typically associated with T cells — immune cells that recognize fragments of specific viruses and can kill infected cells or help activate other parts of the immune system. T cells normally are part of a second wave of defense launched by the immune system.</p>



<p>But IL-17A is also produced by immune cells from the body’s first line of defense. Both older and younger people had similar numbers of T cells linked to the signaling molecule. That means the abundance of IL-17A seen in young people likely came from immune cells tied to the body’s early defenses against the virus, the researchers suggest.</p>



<p>Compared with adults who had severe COVID-19, younger patients who did not need a ventilator also had lower levels of other immune signaling proteins involved in inflammation, like one called IL-6 that has been linked to an overactive immune response. That overreaction is responsible for severe symptoms in many of the sickest COVID-19 patients.</p>





<p>One potential issue with the study is that the results weren’t adjusted for underlying conditions, says Mark Slifka, a viral immunologist at Oregon Health &amp; Science University in Portland. Adults in the study were more likely to have high-risk conditions like diabetes and <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coronavirus-covid-19-why-some-heart-patients-especially-vulnerable">high blood pressure</a>, which could help explain the differences in disease compared with younger people (<em>SN: 3/20/20</em>).</p>



<p>Older adults did ultimately mount a stronger virus-specific immune response later in infection, compared with younger people. How helpful that response actually is remains unknown. Older adults, especially those on a ventilator or who had died, had a stronger response of T cells that recognized a protein on the virus’ surface, called the spike, compared with younger people. People older than 24 also made more antibodies that prevent the virus from infecting new cells, called neutralizing antibodies.</p>



<p>“It’s not that [adults] can’t make a neutralizing antibody response,” says Herold, of the Albert Einstein College of Medicine and the Children’s Hospital at Montefiore in New York City. “It’s not that they can’t make a good T cell response. Maybe they make too much of [a late immune response] or a dysregulated one.”</p>



<p>The fact that severely ill adults had more T cells than younger people is interesting, Slifka says, in part because <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coronavirus-covid-19-t-cells-patients-immune-system">the role those immune cells</a> have in COVID-19 is still unclear (<em>SN: 5/15/20</em>). In the study, a high T cell response wasn’t associated with mild disease, hinting that those responses weren’t necessarily protective, Slifka says. But studies need to be done with more patients to know for sure. “We’re still trying to figure out if T cells play a role in protection,” he says.  </p>

                <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/covid-19-coronavirus-antibodies-lab-treatment-immune-system">Antibodies made in the lab show some promise for treating COVID-19</a></h4>

<p>Amid the rush to test and develop potential treatments for COVID-19, lab-made antibodies are showing hints of success. In news releases, two companies announced preliminary results, though shared only limited data, that suggest the experimental drugs may help patients both early and late in infection.</p>



<p>One clinical trial of monoclonal antibodies — human-made versions of immune system defenders produced by the body — suggests that the drugs can help keep people hospitalized with COVID-19 from needing a ventilator or from dying. And a second trial appears to show that the drugs can bring down levels of the coronavirus in recently infected people, and help reduce the chances that a person would need hospitalization.</p>



<p>Antibodies are part of the body’s natural defense against infectious pathogens. The proteins typically attach to parts of bacteria or viruses to fight off infection. In the lab, scientists can <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/new-coronavirus-vaccine-development-process-accelerating">engineer versions of antibodies</a> to recognize specific targets in order to hinder the virus’ replication or prevent the body’s immune system from overreacting to the virus (<em>SN: 2/21/20</em>).</p>

<p>A monoclonal antibody drug called tocilizumab is one of the latter types; it blocks a part of the immune response that can cause inflammation, a protein known as IL-6. By curbing inflammation, the drug could help people whose <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/covid-19-coronavirus-immune-system-early-treatment-interferon">immune systems have become overactive</a> through a process called a cytokine storm, which can cause severe COVID-19 symptoms (<em>SN: 8/6/20</em>).</p>



<p>In a Phase III clinical trial of 389 people hospitalized with COVID-19, those who received tocilizumab were <a href="https://www.gene.com/media/press-releases/14881/2020-09-17/genentechs-phase-iii-empacta-study-showe">44 percent less likely</a> to need a ventilator or die compared with people who got a placebo, San Francisco–based biotechnology company Genentech announced September 17 in a news release. Of those who received the drug, 12.2 percent of people needed a ventilator or died, compared with 19.3 percent of patients who received a placebo. Still, when the researchers looked at death alone, the drug did not result in a statistically significant difference in mortality between the groups.  </p>



<p>Saying that it was still analyzing the data, the company did not provide such specifics as how many people died in each group.</p>



<p> “A 44-percent decrease is definitely very intriguing,” says Abhijit Duggal, a critical care specialist at the Cleveland Clinic who has treated people with COVID-19. But because the results have been publicized in a news release, without key patient information, “I don’t know what to really make of that,” Duggal says. Only as more data come in will experts be able to conclusively say whether the drug might help people, he says. The announced results have not yet been vetted by outside experts or published in a peer-reviewed journal.</p>



<p>Unlike many other clinical trials of potential COVID-19 drugs and treatments, the Genentech trial focused on groups of people that have been <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coronavirus-why-african-americans-vulnerable-covid-19-health-race">disproportionately impacted</a> by the virus (<em>SN: 4/10/20</em>). Around 85 percent of people in the study are Black, Hispanic and Native American. People in these groups are more likely than white people to be infected or die from COVID-19, studies have shown. In part that’s due to high rates of underlying conditions like high blood pressure and jobs with a higher risk of exposure to the virus.</p>



<p>“It’s really important that [the researchers] are including a diverse population,” says Rajesh Gandhi, an infectious disease physician at Massachusetts General Hospital and Harvard Medical School in Boston. “That is critical as we do these trials.”</p>





<p>In a previous Genentech-related trial that included 452 people with severe COVID-19, tocilizumab <a href="https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.27.20183442v2">did not help improve symptoms</a> or prevent death, researchers reported in a preliminary study posted September 12 at medRxiv.org. Other trials of the drug have <a href="https://www.aphp.fr/contenu/tocilizumab-improves-significantly-clinical-outcomes-patients-moderate-or-severe-covid-19">reported improved outcomes</a> in people with moderate or severe COVID-19 symptoms.</p>



<p>Importantly, the new trial focused on hospitalized people before they required a ventilator, says Jamie Freedman, Genentech’s head of U.S. medical affairs. So differences among trials could be a timing issue. “If you give it too early, before cytokines are elevated, would there be a benefit there? When patients are already in the ICU, is it too late?… Or is there some sweet spot in the middle?” Freedman says. “Those are analyses that really need to continue.”    </p>



<p>Scientists working on another monoclonal antibody, which targets the coronavirus’ <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/new-coronavirus-vaccine-development-process-accelerating">spike protein</a>, also recently reported promising results (<em>SN: 2/21/20</em>). Called LY-CoV555, the drug can <a href="https://investor.lilly.com/news-releases/news-release-details/lilly-announces-proof-concept-data-neutralizing-antibody-ly">reduce the amount of virus</a> in the bodies in newly infected people and help prevent COVID-19 hospitalizations, Indianapolis-based pharmaceutical company Eli Lilly announced September 16 in a news release.  </p>



<p>People in this ongoing Phase II clinical trial to determine efficacy receive either a low, medium or high dose of the antibody or a placebo. So far, those who get a medium dose of LY-CoV555, which is based on an antibody from one of the first COVID-19 patients in the United States, appear to clear the virus faster than those on the placebo, according to the release. Fewer treated patients still had high viral loads later on in the study. Most people, including those on a placebo, cleared the virus from their bodies by day 11. Like Genentech, Eli Lilly released only limited data. The announced results have not yet been vetted by outside experts or published in a peer-reviewed journal.</p>

<p>“It’s really intriguing and tantalizing information,” Gandhi says. But without the full details of the study, like patient age or whether any people had underlying conditions, it’s difficult to know how solid the findings are, he says.</p>



<p>It’s surprising that people on the medium dose had a benefit from the drug but those on the higher dose didn’t, but that could be because the results are preliminary and could change as people are added to the trial, says Nina Luning Prak, an immunologist at the University of Pennsylvania. “But in principle, it looks hopeful,” she says.</p>



<p>What’s more, of 302 people treated with any amount of LY-CoV555, five, or 1.7 percent, landed in the hospital, while nine people, or 6 percent, in a control group of 150 patients who received a placebo, were hospitalized. It’s unclear based on the results included in the news release, however, whether the difference between the two groups is meaningful. But “if it’s borne out, we’ll see — hopefully soon — that this is important because it shows that an antibody is having an antiviral effect,” Gandhi says.</p>



<p>There are many other monoclonal antibody trials ongoing around the world, many of which feature drugs that bind to a variety of both virus and host proteins. Experts are carefully watching for results, keen to know for sure whether such treatments can help patients. Still, compared with where treatments were in March and April, “we’ve made progress,” Gandhi says. “I think that progress is going to just accelerate.”</p>

<p><em>By </em><a href="http://emilyoliviareynolds.com/">Emily Reynolds</a></p>



<p>Conversations about race are not always easy, as the writer Reni Eddo-Lodge has recently explored in her brilliant book <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/may/30/why-im-no-longer-talking-to-white-people-about-race"><em>Why I’m No Longer Talking To White People About Race</em></a>. But they’re no less necessary for it: not talking about racism is simply not an option, particularly for those of us who benefit from structural inequality.</p>



<p>We all have a part to play in this ongoing dialogue — including parents of children growing up in a world full of <a href="https://www.bps.org.uk/news-and-policy/bps-statement-racial-injustice">racial injustice</a>. Previous research has suggested that constructive conversations about race and ethnicity can have positive outcomes for children of all races — increased empathy, an ability to learn about and accept different perspectives, a better understanding of their own identity, and less racial bias.</p>



<p>But a <a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2020-57182-001">new paper</a> from Jessica Sullivan at Skidmore College and colleagues, published in the <em>Journal of Experimental Psychology</em>, suggests that those crucial conversations are being delayed — because parents are misjudging their children’s ability to process and understand race.</p>


<p><span id="more-40359"></span></p>


<p>In the first two studies, the researchers asked almost 1,200 participants to indicate on a sliding scale the earliest age at which they would talk to children about race. Participants also stated what age, in months, they believed children developed certain behaviours and abilities. These questions focused on three areas: development of behaviours around race (e.g. the age at which children begin to prefer faces from their own racial groups), social development (e.g. the age at which children can tell faces from non-faces), and general development (e.g. the age at which children can recognise their mother’s voice). Some were about relatively less complex processes, such as recognising faces of different races, while others concerned higher level processes, such as inferring the status of group members by race.</p>



<p>Compared to the best estimate from scientific research, participants were out by less than a year in their estimates of children’s general development and by two years for social development — but by four years for race questions, vastly overestimating the age that children begin to develop race-related capacities. Participants also stated that conversations about race should first happen around a child’s fifth birthday, and their beliefs weren’t influenced by their race, age, sex, experience with children or how diverse their everyday environment is.</p>



<p>The third study looked at the causal relationship between these factors — if participants had better knowledge of developmental milestones, would it increase their willingness to talk to children about race at an earlier age? To find out, the team randomly assigned 328 participants to one of three categories in which they saw pieces of information related to either children’s ability to understand race (e.g. “Babies spontaneously prefer faces from particular racial groups at around three months of age”), adult interpretation of race, and general child development.</p>



<p>It seemed to work. Those who read facts about children’s abilities to understand race estimated the age of development of these capacities at less than 18 months from the best scientific estimates — and they endorsed discussing race with children a year earlier than participants who learned about adults and race.</p>



<p>Of course, it’s unclear when the optimal age to start talking to children about race is, but given that increased knowledge was certainly good for adults, it makes sense that children would benefit from explicit conversations too, as previous research has shown.</p>



<p>A better understanding of <em>how</em> to talk about race with children might also help. Another recent paper, written by Katharine E. Scott and a team from the University of Wisconsin-Madison and published in <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/1745691620927702"><em>Perspectives on Psychological Science</em></a>, found scant evidence for the effectiveness of various parental interventions for reducing racial biases in children, and called for other researchers to develop “supported, specific, shareable suggestions” for parents wanting to engage their children in conversations about race.</p>



<p>It would also be useful to explore differences in approaches in such conversations between parents of different races: although in this study participant race made no difference to knowledge about children’s developmental milestones, the team acknowledges that a Black family is unlikely to talk about race in the same way as a White family.</p>



<p>What we know for sure is that children are growing up in a heavily racialised world — and it’s children of colour who are feeling the brunt of that, experiencing racial discrimination well before they even reach adolescence. Having simple conversations with your children can’t undo structural inequality — but it should be considered a vital part of children’s socialisation. </p>



<p>– <a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2020-57182-001">Adults delay conversations about race because they underestimate children’s processing of race.</a></p>

                <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/stellar-winds-how-planetary-nebulae-stunning-shapes">Stellar winds hint at how planetary nebulae get their stunning shapes</a></h4>

<p>In their dying throes, some stars leave behind <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/planetary-nebula-stars-death-mystery">beautiful planetary nebulae</a> — disk, spiral or even butterfly-shaped clouds of dust and gas (<em>SN: 5/17/18</em>).</p>



<p>How these fantastically shaped clouds arise from round stars is a mystery. New observations of red giant stars suggest that <a href="https://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/doi/10.1126/science.abb1229">massive planets or other objects orbiting dying stars help stir up stellar winds and shape planetary nebulae</a>, researchers report in the Sept. 18 <em>Science</em>.</p>



<p>“We were wondering how stars can get these beautiful shapes,” says Leen Decin, an astrophysicist at KU Leuven in Belgium. So she and her colleagues examined 14 stars in the red giant phase, before they become planetary nebulae. Data from the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array in Chile revealed that stellar winds — fast-moving flows of gas, dust and subatomic particles such as protons — ejected from the red giant stars have different shapes, including spirals, disks and cones.</p>



<p>Mathematical calculations revealed that the mass and orbit of nearby objects, such as planets or another star, could be shaping these stellar winds. The researchers also made 3-D simulations based on the calculations. Stellar wind shapes created in the simulations largely matched those seen in the observations, the team found. The speed of the winds and how quickly a red giant loses mass as it slowly dies also play a role in making those shapes.</p>



<p>Because planetary nebula shapes resemble these winds’ shapes, the researchers conclude that these same forces influence a nebula’s final shape, long before the nebula itself is created.  “The action of the shaping does not happen when the star becomes a planetary nebula,” Decin says, but is already happening hundreds of thousands to millions of years before, during the red giant phase. This means that it might be possible to predict the shapes of planetary nebulae long before they form, she says.</p>

Decin <em>et al/Science </em>2020, ALMA/ESO</span></figure>



<p>Capturing the new images with the same telescope in “great detail and high resolution” gives researchers a way to compare the winds of these dying stars one another, says Quentin Parker, an astrophysicist at the University of Hong Kong. Even when scientists look at different stars, there seem to be some common causes of the various shapes seen in the winds, he says.</p>



<p>Still, there’s sometimes too much time between the red giant phase and the planetary nebula phase to directly connect the two, Parker says. “Although companion objects may indeed play a major role in shaping both red giant winds and planetary nebula,” he says, it doesn’t mean that those stellar winds can always be used for “predicting what the planetary nebula will look like later.”</p>

<p>Calcium imaging is a powerful method to record from many neurons simultaneously. But what do the recorded signals really mean?</p>



<p>This question can only be properly addressed by experiments which record both calcium signals and action potentials from the same neuron (ground truth recordings). These recordings are technically quite challenging. So we assembled several existing ground truth datasets, and in addition recorded ground truth datasets ourselves, totaling &gt;200 neuronal recordings.</p>



<p>This blog blog posts contains raw movies together with recorded action potentials (black; also turn on your speakers for the spikes!) and the recorded ΔF/F of the calcium recording (blue). These ground truth data are a very direct way for everybody into calcium imaging to get an intuition about what is really going on. (Scroll down if you want to see recordings in zebrafish!)</p>

<p>Something completely different: recording from a pyramidal neuron in Ca3 with <strong>R-CaMP1.07</strong>, virally induced, recorded by Stefano Carta, from <a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.31.272450v1">Rupprecht et al., bioRxiv, 2020</a>. What appears as single events are actually bursts of 5-15 action potentials with inter-spike-intervals of &lt;6 ms.</p>

<p>A recording that I performed myself in adult zebrafish, in a subpart of the homolog of olfactory cortex (aDp) with <strong>GCaMP6f</strong>, tg(neuroD), in <a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.31.272450v1">Rupprecht et al., bioRxiv, 2020</a>. Around second 20, it is visible that even a single action potential can be seen in the calcium signal. However,this was not always the case in other neurons that I recorded from the same brain region.</p>

<p>What can you do if you want to detect single isolated action potentials with calcium imaging? GCaMP, due to its sigmoid non-linearity, is by often a bad choice and will be strongly biased towards bursts. Synthetic indicators, however, are very linear in the low-calcium regime. – This is a recording that I did myself in adult zebrafish, in a subpart of the homolog of olfactory cortex (pDp) with the injected synthetic indicator <strong>OGB-1</strong> in <a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.31.272450v1">Rupprecht et al., bioRxiv, 2020</a>. Although the temporal resolution of the calcium recording is rather low, the indicator clearly responds to single action potentials. As another asset, the indicator not only fills the cytoplasm of the neuron in a ring-like shape, which makes neuropil-contamination much less of an issue compared to GCaMPs.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-video wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-videopress"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">

</div></figure>



<p>Another recording that I performed in adult zebrafish, in a subpart of the homolog of olfactory cortex (pDp) with the injected synthetic indicator <strong>Cal-520</strong> in <a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.31.272450v1">Rupprecht et al., bioRxiv, 2020</a>. This indicator is much more sensitive compared to OGB-1, but also diffuses less well after bolus injection. – These two minutes of recording only contain 4 spikes (this brain region really is into low firing rates in general), but you can clearly see all of them. If this were a GCaMP recording, you would probably see only a flat line throughout the entire recording.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/ultraviolet-aurora-comet-67p-rosetta-space">Rosetta data reveal an invisible ultraviolet aurora around comet 67P</a></h4>

<p>Comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko has its own version of the northern lights.</p>



<p>Observations taken by the Rosetta spacecraft reveal the comet’s aurora, which — unlike Earth’s eye-catching light shows — shimmers in invisible ultraviolet light, researchers report online September 21 in <em>Nature Astronomy</em>. Comet 67P joins comet C/Hyakutake 1996 B2, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/martian-aurora-high-altitude-dust-clouds-surprise-scientists">Mars</a> (<em>SN: 3/19/15</em>), <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/saturn-auroras-may-explain-planet-weirdly-hot-upper-atmosphere">Saturn</a> (<em>SN: 4/6/20</em>) and moons of Jupiter as known hosts of extraterrestrial auroras.</p>



<p>Electrons in the solar wind — a stream of charged particles continually flowing from the sun — interact with the gas surrounding 67P to create the auroral glow, planetary scientist Marina Galand of Imperial College London and colleagues report. Solar wind electrons are drawn toward the comet by an electric field surrounding 67P, similar to the way electrons cascade into Earth’s atmosphere to produce the <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/wonders-northern-lights">northern and southern lights</a> (<em>SN: 7/25/14</em>).</p>



<p>Electrons strike oxygen in Earth’s atmosphere to paint the sky red and green. But solar wind electrons strike water molecules in 67P’s coma, or shroud of gas. That shatters the water molecules and makes some of the resulting oxygen and hydrogen atoms glow ultraviolet. A similar water-smashing interaction creates auroras on Jupiter’s moons Europa and <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/aurora-shift-confirms-ganymedes-ocean">Ganymede</a> (<em>SN: 3/12/15</em>).</p>



<p>Also unlike Earth, 67P has no magnetic field to steer incoming electrons toward the poles and form <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/auroras-dunes-pulsating-cusp-steve">auroras with distinct patterns in the sky</a> (<em>SN: 2/7/20</em>). If 67P’s ultraviolet aurora were visible, it would look like a diffuse halo around the comet.</p>



<p>Such cometary auroras could someday be used to probe variations in the solar wind, Galand says. That may lead to better forecasts for <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/nasa-parker-solar-probe-aiming-sun">space weather</a>, which can mess with satellites and power grids (<em>SN: 7/5/18</em>).</p>

<p><em>By</em> <a href="https://emmayoung.net/">Emma Young</a></p>



<p>Many of us are faced with daily temptations to cheat. You might be offered the chance to download pirated music, perhaps. Or you might wonder about passing your child off as younger than they are, to avoid buying them a ticket on public transport.</p>



<p>As the authors of a <a href="https://www.pnas.org/content/117/32/19080.short?rss=1">new paper</a>, published in <em>PNAS</em>, point out, several lines of research propose that cognitive control is needed for us to resolve the conflict between wanting to cheat and wanting to be honest. We need, in other words, to make an effort to rein in our impulses. However, the new work, led by Sebastian Speer at Erasmus University in the Netherlands, shows that this means different things for different people. If you’re typically honest, cognitive control can turn you into a cheat.</p>


<p><span id="more-40350"></span></p>


<p>The team recruited 40 young adults (aged 18-35) who were told they were taking part in a study into visual search (a later survey confirmed that none realised it was really about cheating). While in an MRI scanner, they were shown a series of pairs of “spot the difference” images — the sort you can find in any kids’ puzzle book. They were told that there were three differences between each pair (the colour in one region might be different in one of the images, for example, or an item included in one was missing from the other).</p>



<p>All that participants had to do was signal if and when they’d spotted these three differences, and they’d receive a small monetary reward. If they couldn’t find the three differences, they were not to signal. However, in only half the trials were there actually three differences. In a quarter of the trials, there were only two differences, and in the final quarter, there was only one. The participants had, then, regular opportunities to cheat — to report that they’d spotted three differences to gain the money, even though half the time this was impossible. The potential benefits weren’t small: a participant who cheated whenever they had the chance would earn about €35 vs €7.50 for someone who was always honest. And as far as the participants knew, the researchers would be oblivious to this cheating.</p>



<p>The researchers were, however, able to monitor not only all instances of cheating but also each participant’s brain activity through each of the trials. And their analysis of the data revealed a series of fascinating results:</p>



<ul><li> There was a big range in cheating behaviour: 17.5% of participants cheated on only one or two trials whereas 5% missed only one or two opportunities to cheat, with the rest falling somewhere in between.</li></ul>



<ul><li>The group was then divided into “honest” types (who cheated relatively infrequently) and “cheaters” (who cheated relatively often). And the team found that when faced with the opportunity to cheat, the honest ones showed greater activation of the “self-referential thinking network”. Our self-concepts are represented by this network, which includes the medial prefrontal cortex, posterior cingulate cortex and temporoparietal junctions. The results suggest, then, that a more honest individual’s self-concept as being an “honest” person became relevant to their decision about whether to cheat or not. There was stronger connectivity within this network when they actually then behaved honestly vs dishonestly.</li></ul>



<ul><li>Cheaters showed stronger sensitivity to the prospect of financial reward than the honest types (as indicated by higher levels of activity in the nucleus accumbens, which plays a central role in the reward circuit); as the team explains, this means that cheaters “were more strongly driven by reward when making the decision whether to cheat or not”.</li></ul>



<ul><li>For cheaters, more cognitive control (represented by higher levels of activity in the inferior frontal gyrus and anterior cingulate cortex) was needed to overcome their tendency to be dishonest, whereas for honest types, more cognitive control was needed for them to overcome their tendency not to cheat, and dishonestly claim a payment.</li></ul>



<p>Earlier studies into the role of cognitive control in regulating cheating behaviour have produced conflicting results. These new findings explain why: “Our results suggest that cognitive control is not needed to be honest or dishonest per se but that it depends on an individual’s moral default…cognitive control allows honest people to cheat at times, whereas it enables cheaters to sometimes be honest.”</p>



<p>Why would honest types want to overcome their honest impulses? Because, as the researchers note, it’s possible to strike a balance between being an “honest” person and also one who takes an opportunity to profit from cheating from time to time. But as we don’t like to change our self-concepts, and try to avoid this happening, honest people have to make an effort to overcome this barrier and cheat.</p>



<p>There are of course huge economic costs to dishonest behaviour, and major campaigns to discourage people from fare-dodging, for example. “These findings may prove to be useful for developing interventions targeted at reducing cheating and dishonesty,” the researchers write.</p>



<p>This may well be the case, but the results certainly suggest that there won’t be a one-size-fits-all solution. Clearly, different things can drive people towards honesty — or the reverse.</p>

<p>Ostracods look like nothing more than seeds with legs. But some species of these tiny crustaceans have an outsize claim to fame: giant sperm. In the most extreme case, it can stretch 1.18 centimeters, over three times the length of an adult.</p>



<p>A newfound collection of ostracods preserved in amber reveals that <a href="https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rspb.2020.1661">megasperm dates back to at least about 100 million years ago</a> during the time of the dinosaurs, researchers report online September 16 in <em>Proceedings of the Royal Society B</em>. A tangle of sperm found inside a female is among the oldest, if not the oldest, fossilized sperm ever found.</p>

<p>A single piece of amber from Myanmar held 39 ostracods, including many from a newly discovered species, <em>Myanmarcypris hui</em>. Using micro-CT scans, Dave Horne, a micropaleontologist at Queen Mary University of London, and colleagues peered inside a few of the tiny shelled animals.</p>



<p>“We knew from looking at the piece of amber with an ordinary light microscope that there were antennae and legs sticking out of the shell, so we were hopeful of finding internal organs,” Horne says. If delicate parts like legs and antennae are preserved, it’s likely that other soft parts are too, he says. “But what we saw … exceeded expectations.”</p>





<p>The layout of internal sex organs resembled that of their modern-day counterparts. And inside a <em>M. hui </em>female, the team found preserved giant sperm packing her seminal receptacles.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/tiny-creature-giant-sperm">Ostracods</a> aren’t the only animal with giant sperm (<em>SN: 7/23/12</em>). Some fruit flies, for example, also <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/fruit-flys-giant-sperm-quite-exaggeration">rely on megasperm</a> (<em>SN: 5/25/16</em>). In ostracods, giant sperm possibly resulted from “competition between sperms of two or more males trying to fertilize the eggs of the same female,” Horne says. “This must be a highly successful reproductive strategy to have lasted for a hundred million years.” Ostracod sperm must make a long, winding journey from the female’s vagina to her eggs, adds study coauthor Renate Matzke-Karasz, a geobiologist at Ludwig Maximilians University Munich. Spirals in the canal to the eggs make the distance longer than the entire length of the female. Shorter sperm might not be able to make the journey, Matzke-Karasz says.</p>

<p>Finding ancient preserved sperm is rare, as soft tissues often decompose. But a series of recent discoveries — <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/blog/science-ticker/giant-17-million-year-old-fossil-sperm-found">17-million-year-old ostracod sperm</a> reported in 2014 (<em>SN: 5/14/14</em>) and <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/50-million-year-old-fossil-sperm-discovered">50-million-year-old worm sperm</a> described in 2015 (<em>SN: 7/14/15</em>) — has expanded the sperm fossil record. The new find rivals the age of <a href="https://doi.org/10.1080/08912963.2018.1483362">reported fossilized sperm found in crickets</a> from the Cretaceous Period. But Horne, Matzke-Karasz and colleagues argue that the newfound ostracod sperm is “the oldest unequivocal fossil animal sperm.”</p>



<p>“The two bundles of filaments are in the correct position within the female,” says Robin Smith, a zoologist at Lake Biwa Museum in Shiga Prefecture, Japan, who was not involved in the study. “I have looked at a lot of ostracod spermatozoa over the years, and there is no question; these are preserved spermatozoa.” The evidence of ancient cricket sperm is less clear, he says. Matzke-Karasz and colleagues argue that the cricket fossil could be a sperm tube, used to transfer the sperm, rather than the sperm itself.</p>



<p>George Poinar, an entomologist and paleontologist at Oregon State University in Corvallis who described the ancient cricket, stands by his conclusions. But regardless of which fossil is the oldest, this new discovery shows that certain features — like giant sperm — have stood the test of time, Poinar says.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“It is not easy when people start listening to all the nonsense you talk. Suddenly, there are many more opportunities and enticements than one can ever manage.”</p>

</blockquote>
<p>In 1990 Glendon MacGregor, a restaurant waiter in Pretoria, South Africa, set up an elaborate hoax in which he posed as the crown prince of Liechtenstein to organize for himself a state visit to his own country. Amazingly, the ruse lasted for two weeks, and during that time MacGregor was wined and dined by numerous South African dignitaries. He had a blast in his home town, living it up in a posh hotel, and enjoying a trip to see the Blue Bulls in Loftus Versfeld stadium. The story is the subject of  the 1993 Afrikaans film “<a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0438954/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Die Prins van Pretoria</a>” (The Prince of Pretoria). Now, another Pretorian is at it, except this time not for two weeks but for several months. And, unlike MacGregor’s hoax, this one does not just embarrass a government and leave it with a handful of hotel and restaurant bills. This hoax risks lives.</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Levitt" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Michael Levitt</a>, a Stanford University Professor of structural biology and winner of  the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 2013, wants you to believe the COVID-19 pandemic is over in the US. He claimed it <a href="https://twitter.com/MLevitt_NP2013/status/1287036738565738496?s=20" rel="noopener" target="_blank">ended on August 22nd, with a total of 170,000 deaths</a> (there are now over 200,000 with hundreds of deaths per day). He claims those 170,000 deaths <a href="https://twitter.com/MLevitt_NP2013/status/1262799080402628608?s=20" rel="noopener" target="_blank">weren’t even COVID-19 deaths</a>, and since <a href="https://cdnwp.tonyrobbins.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/EuroMOMO_Influenza_and_COVID19_Have_Similar_Total_and_Age_Range_Excess_Deaths.pdf" rel="noopener" target="_blank">the virus is not very dangerous</a>, he suggests you infect yourself. How? <a href="https://twitter.com/MLevitt_NP2013/status/1278561306006691845?s=20" rel="noopener" target="_blank">He proposes you set sail on a COVID-19 cruise</a>.</p>
<p><img alt="Royal Caribbean Wonder of the Sea world's largest cruise ship under  construction - Business Insider" class="aligncenter" height="377" src="https://i.insider.com/5f5a54307ed0ee001e25e8b1?width=1100&amp;format=jpeg&amp;auto=webp" width="503" /></p>
<p>Levitt’s lunacy began with an attempt to save the world from epidemiologists. Levitt presumably figured this would not be a difficult undertaking, because, he has noted, <span style="font-size: inherit;">“<a href="https://twitter.com/gummibear737/status/1279167888038023170?s=20" rel="noopener" target="_blank">epidemiologists see their job not as getting things correct</a>“. I guess he figured that he could do better than <em>that</em>.</span> On<span style="font-size: inherit;"> February 25th of this year, at a time when there had already been 2,663 deaths due to the SARS-CoV-2 virus in China but before the World Health Organization had declared the COVID-19 outbreak a pandemic, he delivered what sounded like good news. </span><a href="https://global.chinadaily.com.cn/a/202002/25/WS5e545c76a310128217279f34.html" rel="noopener" style="font-size: inherit;" target="_blank">He predicted that the virus had almost run its course</a><span style="font-size: inherit;">, and that the final death toll in China would be 3,250. This turned out to be a somewhat optimistic prediction. As of the writing of this post (September 21, 2020), there have been 4,634 reported COVID-19 deaths in China, and there is reason to believe that the actual number of deaths has been far higher (see, e.g. </span><a href="https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.05.28.20116012v2" rel="noopener" style="font-size: inherit;" target="_blank">He et al., 2020</a><span style="font-size: inherit;">, </span><a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanpub/article/PIIS2468-2667(20)30089-X/fulltext" rel="noopener" style="font-size: inherit;" target="_blank">Tsang et al., 2020</a><span style="font-size: inherit;">, </span><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-04-01/china-concealed-extent-of-virus-outbreak-u-s-intelligence-says" rel="noopener" style="font-size: inherit;" target="_blank">Wadham and Jacobs, 2020</a><span style="font-size: inherit;">).</span></p>
<p>Instead of publishing his methods or waiting to evaluate the veracity of his claims, Levitt signed up for multiple media interviews. Emboldened by “interest in his work” (who doesn’t want to interview a Nobel laureate?), he started making more predictions of the form “COVID-19 is not a threat and the pandemic is over”. On March 20th he said that “<a href="https://www.jpost.com/israel-news/nobel-laureate-israel-will-have-no-more-than-ten-coronavirus-deaths-621407" rel="noopener" target="_blank">he will be surprised if the number of deaths in Israel surpasses 10</a>“. Unfortunately, there have been 1,256 COVID-19 deaths in Israel so far with a massive increase in cases over the past few weeks and no end to the pandemic in sight. On March 28th, when Switzerland had 197 deaths, he <a href="https://twitter.com/MLevitt_NP2013/status/1243929765876301825?s=20" rel="noopener" target="_blank">predicted the pandemic was almost over and would end with 250</a>. Switzerland are now seen 1,762 deaths and <a href="https://www.thelocal.ch/20200915/worst-infection-rate-in-switzerland-vaud-to-introduce-new-lockdown-measures-from-thursday" rel="noopener" target="_blank">a recent dramatic increase in cases has overwhelmed hospitals in some regions leading to new lockdown measures</a>. Levitt’s predictions have come loose and fast. On June 28th <a href="https://twitter.com/MLevitt_NP2013/status/1277278261979090945?s=20" rel="noopener" target="_blank">he predicted deaths in Brazil would plateau at 98,000</a>. There have been over 137,000 deaths in Brazil with hundreds of people dying every day now. In Italy he predicted on March 28th that <a href="https://twitter.com/MLevitt_NP2013/status/1243905625714831363?s=20" rel="noopener" target="_blank">the pandemic was past its midpoint and deaths would end at 17,000 – 20,000.</a> There have now been 35,707 deaths in Italy. The way he described the situation in the country at the time, when <a href="https://www.voanews.com/science-health/coronavirus-outbreak/surprising-reason-northern-italy-crematoria-are-overwhelmed" rel="noopener" target="_blank">crematoria were overwhelmed</a>, was “normal”.</p>
<p>I became aware of Levitt’s predictions via an email list of the <a href="https://www.iscb.org/iscb-fellows" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Fellows of the International Society of Computational Biology</a> on March 14th. I’ve been a Fellow for 3 years, and during this time I’ve received hardly any mail, except during Fellow nomination season. It was therefore somewhat of a surprise to start receiving emails from Michael Levitt regarding COVID-19, but it was a time when scientists were scrambling to figure out how they could help with the pandemic and I was excited at the prospect of all of us learning from each other and possibly helping out. Levitt began by sending around a <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/am2437ywxnh4b84/CURRENT.Analysis_of_Coronavirus-2019_Data_Michael_Levitt.pdf?dl=0" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PDF via a Dropbox link</a> and asked for feedback. I wrote back right away suggesting he distribute the code used to make the figures, make clear the exact versions of data he was scraping to get the results (with dates and copies so the work could be replicated), suggested he add references and noted there were several typos (e.g. the formula <img alt="D_n = C_nP_0 + C_{n-1}P_1 + C_{n-2}P_2 + \ldots + C_{n-29}P_2" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=D_n+%3D+C_nP_0+%2B+C_%7Bn-1%7DP_1+%2B+C_%7Bn-2%7DP_2+%2B+%5Cldots+%2B+C_%7Bn-29%7DP_2&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=545454&amp;s=0" title="D_n = C_nP_0 + C_{n-1}P_1 + C_{n-2}P_2 + \ldots + C_{n-29}P_2" /> clearly had wrong indices). I asked that he post it on the bioRxiv so it could receive community feedback, and suggested he fill in some details so I and others could better evaluate the methods (e.g. I pointed out that I thought the use of a Gaussian for <img alt="P_n" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=P_n&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=545454&amp;s=0" title="P_n" /> was problematic).</p>
<p>The initial correspondence rapidly turned into a flurry of email on the ISCB Fellows list. Levitt was full of advice. He suggested everyone wear a mask and I and others pushed back noting, as Dr. Anthony Fauci did at the time, that there was a severe shortage of masks and they should go to doctors first. Several exchanges centered on who to blame for the pandemic (one Fellow suggested immigrants in Italy). Among all of this, there was one constant: Levitt’s COVID-19 advice and predictions kept on coming, and without reflection or response to the well-meaning critiques. After Levitt said he’d be surprised if there were more than 10 deaths in Israel, and after he refused to send code reproducing his analyses, or post a preprint, I urged my fellow Fellows in ISCB to release a statement distancing our organization from his opinions, and emphasizing the need for rigorous, reproducible work. I was admonished by two colleagues and told, in so many words, to shut up. </p>
<p>Meanwhile, Levitt did not shut up. In March, after talking to Israeli newspapers about how he would be surprised if there were more than 10 deaths, <a href="https://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/.premium-the-expert-who-says-israel-is-overreacting-to-coronavirus-1.8689010" rel="noopener" target="_blank">he spoke directly to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu</a> to deliver his message that Israel was overreacting to the virus (<a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/stephaniemlee/ioannidis-trump-white-house-coronavirus-lockdowns" rel="noopener" target="_blank">he tried to speak to US president Donald Trump as well</a>). Israel is now in a very dangerous situation with COVID-19 out of control. It has the <a href="https://www.timesofisrael.com/israel-has-highest-rate-in-world-of-new-coronavirus-infections-per-capita-tv/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">highest number of cases per capita in the world</a>. Did Levitt play a role in this by helping to convince Netanyahu to ease restrictions in the country in May? We may never know. <a href="https://twitter.com/erlichya/status/1301637529406496770?s=20" rel="noopener" target="_blank">There were likely many factors</a> contributing to Israel’s current tragedy but Levitt, by virtue of speaking directly to Netanyahu, should be scrutinized for his actions. What we do know is that at the time, he was making predictions about the nature and expected course of the virus with unpublished methods (i.e. not even preprinted), poorly documented data, and without any possibility for anyone to reproduce any of his work. <span style="font-size: inherit;">His disgraceful scholarship has not improved in the subsequent months. He did, eventually post a <a href="https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.06.26.20140814v2" rel="noopener" target="_blank">preprint</a>, but the data tab states “all data to be made available” and there is the following paragraph relating to availability of code: </span></p>
<blockquote>
<p>We would like to make the computer codes we use available to all but these are currently written in a variety of languages that few would want to use. While Dr. Scaiewicz uses clean self-documenting Jupyter Python notebook code, Dr. Levitt still develops in a FORTRAN dialect call Mortran (Mortran 1975) that he has used since 1980. The Mortran preprocessor produces Fortran that is then converted to C-code using f2c. This code is at least a hundred-fold faster than Python code. His other favorite language is more modern, but involves the use of the now deprecated language Perl and Unix shell scripts.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, the methods proposed here are simple; they are easily and quickly implemented by a skilled programmer. Should there be interest, we would be happy to help others develop the code and test them against ours. We also realize that there is ample room for code optimization. Some of the things that we have considered are pre-calculating sums of terms to convert computation of the correlation coefficient from a sum over N terms to the difference of two sums. Another way to speed the code would be to use hierarchical step sizes in a binary search to find the value of lnN that gives the best straight line.</p>
<p>Our study involving as it did a small group working in different time zones and under extreme time pressure revealed that scientific computation nowadays faces a Babel of computer languages. In some ways this is good as we generally re-coded things rather than struggle with the favorite language of others. Still, we worry about the future of science when so many different tools are used. In this work we used Python for data wrangling and some plotting, Perl and Unix shell tools for data manipulation, Mortran (effectively C++) for the main calculations, xmgrace and gnuplot for other plotting, Excel (and Openoffice) for playing with data. And this diversity is for a group of three!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>tl;dr, there is no code. I’ve asked Michael Levitt repeatedly for the code to reproduce the figures in his paper and have not received it. I can’t reproduce his plots.</p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/mlevitt_np2013/status/1254853253457539072?lang=en" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Levitt now lies when confronted about his misguided and wrong prediction about COVID-19 in Israel</a>. He claims it is a “red herring”, and that he was talking about “excess deaths”. I guess he figures he can hide behind Hebrew. <a href="https://twitter.com/NuritBaytch/status/1256734540015587329?s=20" rel="noopener" target="_blank">There is a recording</a> where anyone can hear him being asked directly if he is saying he will be surprised with more than 10 COVID-19 deaths in Israel, and his answers is very clear: “I will be very surprised”. It is profoundly demoralizing to discover that a person you respected is a liar, a demagogue or worse. Sadly, <a href="https://liorpachter.wordpress.com/2018/05/18/james-watson-in-his-own-words/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">this has happened to me before</a>.</p>
<p>Levitt continues to put people’s lives at risk by spewing lethal nonsense. He is suggesting that we should let COVID-19 spread in the population so it will mutate to be less harmful. <a href="https://twitter.com/BillHanage/status/1307795936924577792?s=20" rel="noopener" target="_blank">This is nonsense</a>. He is promoting anti-vax conspiracy theories <a href="https://twitter.com/MLevitt_NP2013/status/1307634991325753344?s=20" rel="noopener" target="_blank">that are nonsense</a>. He is promoting <a href="https://twitter.com/MLevitt_NP2013/status/1305791799492071425?s=20" rel="noopener" target="_blank">nonsense conspiracy theories about scientists</a>. And yet, <a href="https://www.stuff.co.nz/national/health/coronavirus/122618622/nobel-prize-winner-weighs-in-on-nzs-covid-strategy-from-a-poolside-in-portugal" rel="noopener" target="_blank">he continues to have a prominent voice</a>. It’s not hard to see why. The article, similar to all the others where he is interviewed, begins with “Nobel Prize winner…”</p>


<p>In the Talmud, in Mishnah Sanhedrin 4:9, it is written “Whoever destroys a soul, it is considered as if he destroyed an entire world”. I thought of this when listening to an <a href="https://www.aier.org/article/nobel-laureate-michael-levitt-on-the-lockdowns-i-think-it-is-a-huge-mistake/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">interview with Michael Levitt</a> that took place in May, where he said:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>I am a real baby-boomer, I was born in 1947, and I think we’ve really screwed up. We cause pollution, we allowed the world’s population to increase three-fold, we’ve caused the problems of global warming, we’ve left your generation with a real mess in order to save a really small number of very old people. If I was a young person now, I would say, “now you guys are gonna pay for this.” </p></blockquote>

                <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/snake-bite-venom-cheap-innovative-treatments-save-thousands-victims">Cheap, innovative venom treatments could save tens of thousands of snakebite victims</a></h4>

<p>When Nigerian physician Garba Iliyasu was 10, a venomous snake bit a family member. The man survived, but “it was quite severe,” Iliyasu recalls. “[He] was bleeding profusely.… From the nose. From the mouth. From the ear.”</p>



<p>Since then, Iliyasu, a specialist in infectious and tropical diseases, has tended to hundreds of snakebite victims at Kaltungo General Hospital, a health care hub for the surrounding Gombe State. During the two annual peaks in snakebite cases — the spring planting and autumn harvest seasons — “we see like six, seven to 10 patients in a day, on average,” he says. The hospital has only a few dozen beds. “Most times, you see patients on the floor.”</p>



<p>In the Western world, snakebites are a minor issue. In the United States and Europe, cases are rare and hardly ever fatal. Even in Australia — notorious for its deadly, venomous snakes — bites account for just a handful of annual deaths.</p>



<p>But in sub-Saharan Africa, <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0041010118311802">about 270,000 people are bitten every year</a>, resulting in more than 55,000 cases of post-traumatic stress disorder, over 14,700 amputations and about 12,300 deaths, Iliyasu and colleagues estimated in <em>Toxicon</em> in March 2019. Add in India and other snakebite hot spots and the annual numbers rise to more than 2 million bites that need clinical treatment, according to the World Health Organization. Between 80,000 and 138,000 victims die, and about three times that number have a life–changing disability.</p>





<p>Snakebites are “a neglected disease that affects the neglected section of the society,” Iliyasu says. The worst effects occur in mostly poor, rural communities that depend on farming and herding. Visit these places, he says, and “you will see how devastating the effect of snakebite is.” Victims are often the primary breadwinners of their households, so every death and disability contributes to the cycle of poverty.</p>

</div>



<p>But snakebites are finally getting the attention they’ve long needed. In 2017, the WHO officially recognized snakebites as a neglected tropical disease. That designation has led to an influx of funding for innovative research; the largest, more than $100 million, <a href="https://wellcome.ac.uk/what-we-do/our-work/snakebites">came in 2019</a> from the Wellcome Trust.</p>



<p>Effective snakebite treatments do exist, and those antivenoms are considered the “gold standard” of care. If a victim receives the right antivenom soon after a bite — within an hour or two — then the chances of survival are “very, very high,” says Nicholas Casewell, a biomedical scientist at the Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine in England.</p>



<p>But that “if” looms large, with big challenges remaining, including the difficulties of speedy access to care and the fact that most anti-venoms work against just a few of the hundreds of dangerous species of venomous snakes. Antivenoms are also “a technology that has seen limited innovation for 120 years,” says Andreas Laustsen, a biotech researcher and entrepreneur at the Technical University of Denmark in Kongens Lyngby.</p>



<p>Now, researchers from disparate fields of science are coming together to reimagine the way snakebites are managed. Casewell, Laustsen and others are tweaking current treatments, repurposing pharmaceuticals and even engineering toxin-stopping nanoparticles. The work offers hope that people everywhere, even in remote areas, will eventually be able to safely coexist with snakes.</p>



<div class="wp-block-sciencenews-content-sidebar alignwide">
<h3>Clear danger </h3>



<p>Venomous snakebites, a neglected tropical disease, do the most damage in South and Southeast Asia, sub-Saharan Africa and parts of Central and South America. Recent data from India and Sub-Saharan Africa are still considered underestimates.</p>








</div>



<h4>A tarnished gold standard</h4>



<p>There’s a saying in snakebite care that “time is tissue.” The longer it takes to stop a snake’s venom from moving through the victim’s body, the more damage occurs. Destruction begins from the moment of a bite, and the cocktail of proteins and other molecules in the venom will continue to ravage until the immune system produces enough antibodies to remove or destroy those toxins. The problem is, by the time antibodies have ramped up, it’s often too late.</p>



<p>The tissue maxim is especially true for bites from vipers and other snakes with venoms that target the blood and soft tissues and thus tend to cause more physical damage. But speed is also important for bites from snakes with paralytic venoms, such as the Indian cobra (<em>Naja naja</em>) and southern Africa’s black mamba (<em>Dendroaspis polylepi</em>). Their nerve cell–targeting toxins will progressively slow muscles until the lungs and heart stop working.</p>



<p>That’s where antivenoms come in. They speed up the immune system’s clearance of toxins, because antivenoms are, themselves, antibodies pulled from the blood of large animals, usually horses, that have been injected with venom. When given soon after a snakebite, antivenoms work well.</p>



<p>But for myriad reasons, fast delivery often doesn’t happen.</p>



<p>In rural communities, there may be relatively few health care providers who can stock and administer the intravenously delivered drugs, which often require refrigeration. In India, for instance, the staff in rural public health clinics rarely have the resources or training to safely administer the drugs and monitor for treatment side effects.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="alignright size-full"><img alt="Spitting cobra bite wound" class="wp-image-3091464" src="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/092620_cw_snakebite_inline2_680.jpg" /><span class="caption wp-caption-3091464">Bit by a spitting cobra, this goat herder in Baringo County, Kenya, had to sell his herd to pay for treatment. Months later, the wound had not healed.</span><span class="credit wp-credit-3091464">N. Casewell</span></figure></div>



<p>Patients are often sent several hours away to larger regional hospitals with more expertise. “A lot of [bite victims] die on the way,” says Kartik Sunagar, an evolutionary biologist at the Indian Institute of Science in Bangalore. Sunagar <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0165614720301358">wrote about the challenges of developing antivenoms</a> with Casewell, Laustsen and venom scientist Timothy Jackson of Liverpool in the August <em>Trends in Pharmacological Sciences.</em></p>



<p>Once a patient arrives at a hospital, delays can still occur, Laustsen says, because medical staff wait until they’re completely sure someone needs antivenom before administering it. A large portion of snakebites are “dry,” which means no venom is injected, so antivenom isn’t always required.</p>



<p>Deciding which antivenom to use can be difficult. To glom on to and remove toxic substances, antibodies need to match their target almost exactly. And since each snake species makes its own unique blend of toxins, most venoms need a specific antivenom. Because bite victims can rarely reliably identify the species that bit them, doctors must wait for clear signs of damage to emerge to determine the right antivenom.</p>



<p>A “better safe than sorry” approach may seem warranted, but injecting antivenom when it’s not needed or if it’s the wrong kind can put the patient at even greater risk. As helpful as horse-derived antibodies can be, “the human immune system will recognize them as foreign,” Laustsen notes, and may launch an attack. This reaction to the antivenom itself can be life-threatening if not treated promptly.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img alt="Snakebite victim in a coma" class="wp-image-3091463" src="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/092620_cw_snakebite_inline1_680.jpg" /><span class="caption wp-caption-3091463">A snakebite victim is in a coma and on dialysis to remove excess fluid and toxins from the blood. </span><span class="credit wp-credit-3091463">Medicshots/Alamy Stock Photo</span></figure>



<h4>Friendlier options</h4>



<p>For the last decade or so, researchers have been working to take horses out of the equation to make antivenoms safer — and maybe more affordable. Laustsen is exploring a couple of approaches to avoiding the body’s reactions to horse-made antibodies.</p>



<p>One option is to produce “humanized” antibodies in the lab by replacing the ends of a human antibody gene with the venom-neutralizing parts from an effective equine antibody gene, so the patient’s body wouldn’t see the antibody proteins as foreign. But, even better, he hopes to discover effective fully human antibodies. With both approaches, he says, “you would remove at least 90 percent of all the side effects.”</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="alignright size-full"><img alt="Saw-scaled vipers being milked" class="wp-image-3091462" src="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/092620_cw_snakebite_inline_opener_tall_680.jpg" /><span class="caption wp-caption-3091462">Antivenom production currently relies on a century-old method: Snakes like these saw-scaled vipers are milked for venom, which is injected into horses and other animals. Neutralizing antibodies produced by the horses are then harvested for bite victims.</span><span class="credit wp-credit-3091462">Jeff Rotman/Alamy Stock Photo</span></figure></div>



<p>Taking horses out of the mix may also open the door for designing antibodies that work against venoms from more than a few species. Laustsen and colleagues <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-67654-7">described one promising approach</a> July 1 in <em>Scientific Reports</em>. The key is to take human antibody genes and insert them into bacteria-infecting viruses, which build the antibodies into their shells.</p>



<p>Since large databases of human antibody genes already exist, a whole variety of different human antibodies can be inserted into viruses for high-throughput testing to find antibodies that can bind to — and perhaps neutralize — venom toxins.</p>



<p>As a proof of concept, Laustsen’s team tested 40 billion antibodies from people, and identified one particularly exciting candidate: It protected human cells in lab dishes from more than a dozen lethal toxins from three cobra species.</p>



<p>Once the most broadly effective antibodies are found, Laustsen hopes to copy a page from the insulin-production handbook. For diabetes treatment, insulin used to be extracted from the pancreases of animals; now, it’s made by engineered bacteria in large fermentation tanks. A similar process could work to produce broad-spectrum antivenom, he says.</p>



<p>Moving antibody production out of animals could also have another important benefit: lower production costs. Right now, “antivenom is one of the most expensive drugs that you can find in the rural areas,” explains Muhammad Hamza, a medical doctor who, like Iliyasu, splits his time between research at Nigeria’s Aminu Kano Teaching Hospital and treating patients at the regional treatment center in Gombe State. Many of Hamza’s patients could be saved by antivenom, he says, but they can’t afford to pay for it. If the government hasn’t kept the clinic stocked with free medicine, patients die.</p>



<p>In Nigeria, a vial of antivenom costs around $60 to $70, Iliyasu says. He’s seen patients sell their animals, homes and farms to pay for treatment.</p>



<p>Antivenoms engineered without animals <a href="https://theconversation.com/how-biotechnology-could-offer-hope-for-snakebite-victims-68244">would save patients money</a> because the ideal mix of antibodies would be more potent. At least 70 percent of the antibodies in current antivenoms <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0041010118301144">don’t neutralize venom toxins at all</a>, Iliyasu notes. As a result, it often takes several vials of antivenom — sometimes as many as 10 — to treat a bite patient. Boosting the percentage of neutralizing antibodies in each vial would go a long way toward making antivenoms affordable, Iliyasu says — and that’s why he’s excited to see the move away from animal-based production.</p>

<h3>Mixed bag </h3>



<p>Snake venoms often contain dozens to hundreds of individual toxins. Two snakes’ venom blends are shown here. The carpet viper’s venom is heavy on metalloproteinase toxins, which can cause paralysis and tissue damage.</p>



<div style="width: 100%!; text-align: right!important;"><a class="flourish-credit" href="https://public.flourish.studio/visualisation/3765475/?utm_source=embed&amp;utm_campaign=visualisation/3765475" rel="noopener noreferrer" style="text-decoration: none!important;" target="_top"><img alt="Made with Flourish" src="https://public.flourish.studio/resources/made_with_flourish.svg" style="width: 105px!important; height: 16px!important;" /> </a></div>

<h4>A pill for snakebite</h4>



<p>Other researchers are turning to existing drugs to expand options for snakebite treatments.</p>



<p>Venom toxins generally cause harm by performing specific molecular actions, such as cutting up certain proteins or fats within cells. Targeted molecules that interfere with that nefarious work could potentially stop the toxins.</p>



<p>The idea of using drugs other than antibodies to inhibit venom toxins isn’t new. But it wasn’t until the molecular and genetic technology revolutions of the late 20th century that scientists could really deconstruct venoms to figure out which components are responsible for a venom’s worst effects. “We now have a very good handle on what the toxins are,” Casewell says.</p>



<p>It’s unlikely that one drug, or even a combination, would be able to neutralize the diversity of harmful toxins present in snake venoms and work as effectively as traditional antivenoms. But Casewell’s aim isn’t to replace antivenoms; he wants to safely slow down the most pernicious venom toxins to buy patients time to get to a clinic.</p>



<p>He and colleagues have so far focused on metalloproteinases — toxins that chop up proteins and are major players in the lethal and destructive nature of tissue-destroying venoms, such as those in saw-scaled vipers (<em>Echis</em> spp.). Casewell’s group picked a few drugs already on the market that bind up the metal ions that these proteinases need to function, and right off the bat, the drugs were surprisingly successful.</p>



<p>The group demonstrated that an existing small molecule drug used to treat heavy metal poisoning <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/snakebite-treatment-unithiol-heavy-metal-poisoning">could reduce the deadly damage of viper bites</a> in lab animals (<em>SN: 6/6/20, p. 12</em>). And when paired with another drug that inhibits a family of toxins that chew up certain fats, the drug was even more powerful. In animal tests, the combination <a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.05.13.094599v1">neutralized the venoms</a> of a more diverse collection of five snake species from all over the world.</p>

<h3>Drug duo</h3>



<p>Two drugs together — the PLA2 inhibitor varespladib, and the metallo­proteinase inhibitor marimastat — saved mice from lethal doses of five different snake venoms (results against two of the venoms shown below). Even when the drugs were given 15 minutes after the venom injection, the mice lived (blue lines). Mice that didn’t get the drugs died within four hours (red).</p>

<p>The work is “quite exciting,” Casewell says, because it means small molecule drugs might be able to overcome the problem of geographic fragmentation — each venom needs its own antidote — that keeps antivenom markets too small and nonlucrative for pharmaceutical companies to invest in.</p>



<p>As a bonus, such small molecules are available in pill form and don’t need refrigeration or expert administration, making them easier to distribute in rural communities. In that way, such drugs could become an important “bridge to care,” Iliyasu says.</p>



<h4>Next generation of treatments</h4>



<p>While pills alone may never be a stand-alone treatment for snakebites, there are other alternatives to conventional antivenoms, says Shih-Hui Lee of the University of California, Irvine. “We can use a polymer.”</p>



<p>Lee and colleague Kenneth Shea are new to the field of snakebite treatment. “We’re not snake venom people,” Shea admits. They’re not even biologists. The two are materials scientists. But their approach to overhauling antivenom is so out of the box that it’s getting noticed.</p>



<p>Both spent much of their careers designing carbon polymers — essentially, plastic nanoparticles — with specific, desirable properties. After a while, the duo started to wonder if their designer plastics, which could bind to certain parts of proteins, could mimic the actions of antibodies.</p>



<p>Shea started with melittin, a bee venom toxin. To his surprise, the <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2874824/">polymer nanoparticles worked</a>. When injected into mice shortly after the injection of a life-threatening dose of melittin, the particles bound up enough of the toxin to save the animals’ lives, Shea and colleagues reported in the <em>Journal of the American Chemical Society</em> in 2010.</p>



<p>Those results helped him recruit Lee to the antivenom project and convince well-respected snakebite expert José María Gutiérrez of the University of Costa Rica in San José to collaborate. With his help, Shea and Lee set their sights on phospholipase A2s, a large family of toxins found in many deadly snake venoms.</p>



<p>Once again, Lee says, the polymer nanoparticles <a href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/jacs.6b10950">neutralized the toxins</a>. In 2018, the particles proved effective against another family of snake toxins called three-finger toxins. The “plastic” antibodies <a href="https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pntd.0006736">saved mice from cobra venom</a>, and healthy mice that received them had no adverse reactions, the team reported in <em>PLOS Neglected Tropical Diseases</em>.</p>

<h3>Cobra combat </h3>



<p>When tested in mice, synthetic nanoparticle antibodies prevented skin tissue death caused by black-necked spitting cobra venom. The nanoparticles were most effective when injected into the wound right after the venom was injected (0 min); the longer the wait, the larger the wound.</p>

<p>There are still some design challenges to overcome before testing the polymers in people. The team wants to put these synthetic antibodies into injectable devices — much like an EpiPen — but right now, the nanoparticles are probably too big. So the next hurdle is to make them smaller and more able to travel from the injection site in a muscle to the surrounding tissues.</p>



<p>But the biggest challenge is convincing funding agencies that synthetic antibodies should be on the table. The hesitancy is understandable, Shea says, as there’s nothing like these nanoparticles on the market. “This is untested, so there has to be an element of faith in this,” he says.</p>



<p>Still, Shea and Lee believe in their creation. Producing a broad-spectrum antivenom with the nanoparticles “is technically much less challenging” than with biological antibodies, Shea says, so if the team can secure investors, he thinks the nanoparticles have the potential to be “a quite cheap antidote.”</p>



<p>Others are stepping out of the box, as well. Thanks to the influx of funding in the last few years, researchers around the world are trying all sorts of unconventional approaches to snakebite remedies. There are labs hoping to <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-017-07554-5">design DNA molecules</a> known as aptamers that act like antibodies. Others are turning to animals, such as opossums, <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6052786/">that are naturally immune to venoms</a> in the hopes of translating that immunity into new drugs. All of this work is leading to some truly exciting technological developments, Casewell says.</p>



<p>But none of it will matter if there aren’t also investments in infrastructure and education, Hamza warns. “It is one thing to have the drug.… It’s another thing to get it available to the remotest parts of the world.”</p>



<p>He’s more excited about smartphone apps that could tell people in remote areas where the closest available antivenom is, for instance. And something as simple as providing farmers solid boots with instructions on when and why to wear them could prevent countless snakebites from happening in the first place.</p>



<p>With millions of snakebites occurring every year, there’s certainly many opportunities to improve the situation — and all of them need attention, Casewell says. That attention is finally coming. “This is kind of a once-in-a-lifetime moment for snakebites,” he says.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/covid19-coronavirus-flu-season-fall">What will happen when COVID-19 and the flu collide this fall?</a></h4>

<p>The specter of a “twindemic” — two epidemics at the same time — looms as cold and flu season is set to start in October in the Northern Hemisphere. No one can predict what will happen when flu meets COVID-19, but public health officials are urging people to prepare for the worst.</p>



<p>In this case, the worst would be a bad year for influenza, which in the United States has killed 12,000 to 61,000 people annually and hospitalized between 140,000 and 810,000 each year since 2010, combined with a resurgence of coronavirus infections. Together, the two could stress health care and public health systems beyond their limits.</p>



<p>“We could see a perfect storm of accelerated COVID-19 activity as people gather more inside in particular, as they become increasingly fatigued with the mask wearing, social distancing and the hand hygiene, and as they are exposed to seasonal influenza,” said Jeanne Marrazzo, director of the infectious diseases division of the University of Alabama at Birmingham, during a <a href="https://www.idsociety.org/Podcasts/videos/idsa-media-briefing-september-10-2020/">news briefing</a> from the Infectious Diseases Society of America, or IDSA, on September 10.</p>



<p>Some states are getting coronavirus spread under control, but hospitalization levels haven’t gone down much, she said. “Overall, we still are on … a razor’s edge when it comes to COVID,” and influenza remains unpredictable. “We really can’t be complacent about this.”</p>

<p>Infectious diseases experts worry about a conjunction of influenza and coronavirus for multiple reasons, beyond overburdened health systems. Teasing out whether a person has flu or coronavirus — which have very similar symptoms — will require testing for both viruses, at a time when turnaround for COVID-19 tests is often slow. And some people may get infected with multiple viruses simultaneously, which could make symptoms more severe.</p>



<p>But hints from the Southern Hemisphere give hope that the worst may not happen. Scientists usually forecast flu seasons’ severity in the north by watching what happens south of the equator, where flu season falls in the middle of the year. This year, the preview held good news: a mild season for flu and some other respiratory viruses.</p>



<h4>Southern exposure</h4>



<p>Countries in the Southern Hemisphere normally start seeing flu cases in May, and the flu season typically peaks in July and peters out around October. For the past five to six years, flu seasons in Australia have been bad. For instance, in 2019, Australia got an early flu season that started in March and “went on for a very long time,” says Kanta Subbarao, a virologist who directs the World Health Organization’s Collaborating Centre for Reference and Research on Influenza at the Doherty Institute in Melbourne, Australia.</p>



<p>It wasn’t looking good for 2020 either. This year, flu season started even earlier, she says. “We started seeing some flu activity in January and February,” summer in the Southern Hemisphere. “Then it just completely stopped. It just fell off a cliff at the end of March, essentially when COVID-19 started appearing.”</p>



<p>From April through July, <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/69/wr/mm6937a6.htm">only 33 people had positive flu results in Australia</a> out of 60,031 people tested, an international group of influenza researchers report September 18 in <em>Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report</em> published by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The flu was also nearly nonexistent in South Africa and Chile in the late spring and early summer months. Together, the three countries recorded just 51 flu cases among 83,307 people tested, for a positivity rate of 0.06 percent. By contrast, over the April through July periods in 2017, 2018 and 2019, a total of 24,512 out of 178,690 people had positive flu tests, a positivity rate of 13.7 percent. </p>

<h3>Flu review</h3>



<p>The 2019–2020 flu season may have been cut short by public health measures to limit the spread of COVID-19. Compared with three previous flu seasons, the percent of flu tests that detected the virus dropped precipitously in March after the United States declared COVID-19 a national emergency. Some states had already instituted stay-at-home orders prior to the declaration. Surveillance for influenza typically starts at the end of September (around surveillance week 40) and continues until the beginning of April, though cases may occur year-round. These data go to early August (week 32).</p>

<p>Travel restrictions that closed Australia’s borders may have prevented influenza from being imported from elsewhere. Lockdowns, school closures, mask wearing, social distancing and hand washing — all measures taken to prevent the spread of COVID-19 — may have also quashed any influenza outbreaks that remained. Other Southern Hemisphere countries have also reported unexpectedly low levels of influenza and another common respiratory virus called respiratory syncytial virus, or RSV, she says.</p>



<p>Public health officials anticipated a resurgence of influenza and RSV once Australia reopened schools, but that hasn’t happened, Subbarao says. “We have looked very long and hard,” but have found very little of either disease, Subbarao says. Instead, “what we’re finding is rhinovirus,” which cause colds, Subbarao says, suggesting that rhinovirus hasn’t been fazed by all the public health measures.</p>



<h4>Northern predictions</h4>



<p>Flu season may also be lighter than usual in the Northern Hemisphere as a result of reduced travel, former CDC director Tom Frieden said in an IDSA <a href="https://www.idsociety.org/Podcasts/videos/idsa-media-briefing-september-15-2020/">news briefing</a> on September 15. Flu “gets around the world when people travel, and there’s not much traveling going on.” But COVID-19 remains a threat, he warned “If you doubted that COVID was more infectious than flu, look at South Africa or Chile, where COVID is spreading like wildfire and flu isn’t spreading at all.”</p>



<p>In the United States during the 2019–2020 flu season, flu cases also took a nose dive after public health measures were put in place to limit coronavirus spread. Flu cases started increasing in November 2019, and between December 15 and March 7, more than 20 percent of flu tests were coming back positive each week, according to the <em>MMWR</em> report. By the week of March 22, plenty of people were still getting flu tests, but only 2.3 percent of the results came back positive. Many of those influenza-like illnesses that weren’t due to flu <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coronavirus-covid-19-millions-cases-u-s-may-have-gone-undiagnosed-march">may have been COVID-19</a> (<em>SN: 6/25/20</em>).</p>



<p>Since the week of April 5, fewer than 1 percent of flu tests have detected the virus, and off-season flu counts are at historical lows. From May 17 to August 8, only 0.2 percent of flu tests gave positive results, compared with 2.35 percent last year, 1.04 percent in 2018 and 2.36 percent in 2017. The sharp drop-off of flu cases might just have been the natural end of the flu season. However, the decrease in percent positivity after March 1 “was dramatic, suggesting other factors were at play,” the researchers wrote.</p>



<p>If social distancing and other measures to contain COVID-19 remain in place, the flu season in the United States might be blunted or delayed, the researchers wrote. But don’t bank on it, other experts say. If there’s anything experts who try to predict influenza activity have learned is that flu is unpredictable.</p>





<h4>Battle for dominance</h4>



<p>Predicting how flu will play with COVID-19 is trickier still.</p>



<p>Richard Webby, a virologist at St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital in Memphis, Tenn., is involved in efforts to predict which flu strains will dominate so that vaccines can be designed accordingly. One pattern Webby and other flu researchers have seen over and over again is that when a new pandemic influenza strain arises, it pushes out another strain. For instance, when the 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic strain emerged, another H1N1 flu strain that had been circulating since 1977 disappeared.</p>



<p>SARS-CoV-2 — the virus that causes COVID-19 — and influenza will be competing for hosts to infect, which may result in one virus squeezing out the other, Webby says.</p>



<p> “I find it difficult to believe that there’s going to be widespread flu and widespread COVID activity at the same time. I think one of them will dominate. I couldn’t tell you which one it will be,” he says. Admittedly on the fence, he says that if asked to bet which disease will predominate, “I’d put a little bit of money each way.” He says the two diseases probably won’t both go gangbusters, “but I could easily be horribly wrong.”</p>



<h4>Getting a double dose</h4>



<p>In the battle for hosts, sometimes both viruses win, infecting a person at the same time.</p>



<p>As New York and New Jersey became hot spots of coronavirus spread in the spring, COVID-19 “patients were coming around the clock” to St. Joseph’s University Medical Center in Paterson, N.J., where Balraj Singh works. Singh, a hematologist and oncologist, was called in to treat the patients’ blood clots and plummeting blood cell counts. As he did so, he decided to also test his patients for infections with other viruses that produce similar symptoms. He and colleagues discovered that <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7437098/">three of their patients</a> were infected with SARS-CoV-2 and influenza at the same time. They reported the cases August 18 in <em>Cureus</em>.</p>



<p>Two of the patients had to be intubated, but Singh and colleagues can’t say whether the dual infections made their illnesses worse. All were eventually discharged. It was important to publish the case reports “so somebody else can have a little bit of a head start” in recognizing that some people may have double trouble from viruses, he says.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img alt="flue shot sign" class="wp-image-3091620" src="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/091820_TI_flue_inline-2.jpg" /><span class="caption wp-caption-3091620">There’s still no vaccine against COVID-19, but health officials are asking people to get vaccinated against influenza to help remove one deadly virus from circulation.</span><span class="credit wp-credit-3091620">E. Otwell</span></figure>



<p>Coinfections with SARS-CoV-2 and influenza will probably be uncommon, says David Morens, a virologist and infectious diseases doctor who is the senior scientific advisor to the director of the U.S. National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases in Bethesda, Md.</p>



<p>One analysis suggests only <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7255350/">about 3 percent</a> of COVID-19 patients were simultaneously infected with another virus, researchers reported online May 27 in the <em>Journal of Infection</em>. Those researchers examined 30 studies, mostly from China, that reported on dual infections with bacteria or viruses in people sick with COVID-19. The most common viruses to double up with SARS-CoV-2 were RSV and influenza A.</p>



<h4>Broad defenses</h4>



<p>It’s not impossible to catch viral infections at the same time or in quick succession, but getting one viral infection generally makes it harder to get another one, Morens says. That’s because viral infections tend to rev up the immune system’s generalized antiviral defense system, known as the innate immune system. Catching one virus sets off alarm bells in the form of virus-fighting immune chemicals known as <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/covid-19-coronavirus-immune-system-early-treatment-interferon">interferons</a> (<em>SN: 8/6/20</em>). For a short period after an infection, maybe weeks to months, the immune system stays on high alert with defenses at least partially raised to ward off any subsequent intruders.</p>



<p>That battening of the hatches against other viral invaders is different from the specific kind of immunity that comes from making antibodies against a particular virus. But it still might be useful. For instance, immunologist Ellen Foxman has long suspected that catching colds caused by <a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanmic/article/PIIS2666-5247(20)30114-2/fulltext">rhinovirus may have delayed the 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic </a>in Europe.</p>



<p>“For years I’ve been looking for a way to test” that idea, says Foxman, of Yale School of Medicine. She and colleagues confirmed that flu and rhinovirus don’t seem to mix by examining data from three later flu seasons, spanning November 2016 to March 2019. They found that people were less likely than expected to have dual infections with rhinovirus and influenza, the team reported September 4 in <em>Lancet Microbe</em>.</p>

<p>Infecting human lung cells growing in laboratory dishes provided some clues to why. First, the researchers infected the cells with rhinovirus. Then they tried a few days later to infect the same cells with flu virus. Rhinovirus infections turned up activity of genes involved in the interferon response, preventing flu viruses from replicating in rhinovirus-infected cells, the researchers found. Blocking interferon allowed the flu viruses to reproduce in cells already infected with the cold virus. But interferon response doesn’t last long, “maybe a week or two,” Foxman says.</p>



<p>And that type of protection isn’t perfect, Subbarao says. About 10 percent of the respiratory illnesses are coinfections with two or more viruses.</p>



<p>Some scientists theorize that vaccines against tuberculosis, measles or polio — which contain live, weakened virus or bacteria — might give some measure of protection against COVID-19 by generally toughening the immune system, Subbarao says. FluMist, a nasal spray flu vaccine mainly used for children, might also provide a little nonspecific armor against other viruses, though she cautions that the protection is short-lived and intended only as a stop-gap until there’s a safe, reliable and widely available coronavirus vaccine.</p>



<p>Injected flu vaccines are usually made with killed viruses and don’t offer the same generalized virus protection as live vaccines. But public health officials are urging people to get flu vaccines, to reduce the chances of getting infected with both viruses and hopefully ward off a nasty flu season.  </p>



<p>“If there’s ever a year you need to get your flu shot, get your kids vaccinated, this is the year,” Marrazzo said.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/wildfire-smoke-health-risks-air-quality-pollution">What we know and don’t know about wildfire smoke’s health risks</a></h4>

<p>Acrid smoke continues to pollute skies in the western United States. On some recent days, the air quality in Portland, Seattle, San Francisco and Los Angeles has been so hazardous, it’s ranked among the worst in the world. </p>



<p>It’s hard to predict when the smoke will fully clear. And with some parts of the West  having faced a week or more of extremely polluted air, the unusual, sustained nature of the assault is increasing worries about people’s health.</p>



<p>There’s plenty of evidence that air pollution — a broad category that includes soot, smog, and other pollutants from sources such as traffic, industry and fires — can harm health. The list of medical ailments associated with<a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/list-diseases-linked-air-pollution-growing"> exposure to dirty air</a> includes respiratory diseases, cardiovascular disease and diabetes (<em>SN: 9/19/17</em>).</p>



<p>Most of what’s known about the hazards of wildfire smoke has to do with particulate matter, the tiny bits of solids and liquids in polluted air. Wildfires are especially good at producing particles in a size range that can be dangerous to health. It isn’t clear yet if what fuels wildfire smoke — be it vegetation, a mix of trees and structures, or other human-made sources — affects the toxicity of particulate matter.</p>





<p>A growing body of evidence points to a range of risks to health during or soon after wildfires, such as increased trips to the emergency room for chronic lung conditions. But there are many more questions than answers about the long-term risks for people struggling to cope with day upon day of polluted air, and facing longer and fiercer fire seasons each year <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/2020-extreme-weather-climate-change-hurricane-derecho-wildfire">due to </a><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/2020-extreme-weather-climate-change-hurricane-derecho-wildfire">climate change </a>(<em>SN: 8/27/20</em>).</p>



<p><em>Science News</em> spoke with scientists about what’s in the air, the health risks and what more we need to learn.</p>



<h4>What’s in wildfire smoke?</h4>



<p>Wildfire smoke is a complex mixture of gases and particles that is similar to cigarette smoke but without the nicotine, says physician John Balmes of the University of California, San Francisco, who studies the effects of air pollution on health. “It has the same kind of mixture of nasty small particles and irritant gases.”</p>



<p>The precise chemical makeup of the smoke varies by fire. It depends on “the type of fuel burned — including structures, intensity of the fire, atmospheric mixing, and distance or age of smoke,” says Tania Busch Isaksen, who studies public health effects of wildfire smoke at the University of Washington in Seattle.</p>



<p>“Generally speaking, it’s a mixture of carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide, nitrogen oxides, particle matter — fine to coarse — hydrocarbons and other organic compounds,” she says. “<a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/us-neighborhoods-40-years-worst-air-quality-pollution">Fine particulate matter, PM<sub>2.5</sub></a>, is what we are primarily concerned about when we consider impacts on health” (<em>SN: 7/30/20</em>).</p>



<p><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/air-pollution-shaving-year-our-average-life-expectancy">Those particles</a> are 2.5 micrometers across or smaller, or about one-thirtieth the width of a human hair (<em>SN: 8/22/18</em>). Common in air pollution produced not only by wildfires, but also by power plants and cars, these particles are so tiny that they can be inhaled deeply into the lungs. There, they can trigger inflammation and possibly seep into the bloodstream.</p>



<h4>Can you see how much PM<sub>2.5 </sub>is in the air?</h4>



<p>No. These particles are so tiny and difficult to see that “even if the air seems clear, PM<sub>2.5 </sub>could be at levels that are dangerous,” says Perry Hystad, an environmental epidemiologist at Oregon State University in Corvallis. In the United States, the most reliable gauge of PM<sub>2.5</sub> is the Air Quality Index, or AQI, which is based on data from air quality monitoring stations that measure the concentrations of pollutants in the air.</p>



<p>The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency developed the index to grade levels of common air pollutants, such as ozone, PM<sub>2.5  </sub>and carbon monoxide. On a scale from 0 to 500, higher numbers indicate dirtier air. The EPA assigns AQI scores to different types of pollution based on studies of each contaminant’s health effects.</p>



<p>The EPA considers scores up to 100 — indicating an average 35.4 micrograms of particulate matter per cubic meter of air over 24 hours  — generally safe. Scores from 101 to 200 may pose particular risk to people in sensitive groups, such as children and those with heart or lung diseases. Those people are advised to limit or avoid prolonged or vigorous outdoor activity. Above 200, everyone should cut down on physical activity outside. At scores 300 or above, with at least 250.4 micrograms of PM<sub>2.5</sub> per cubic meter of air, everyone should avoid going outside.</p>



<p>Smoke blanketing the western United States has created hazardous, and at times off-the-chart, levels of pollution in many places. For instance, on the morning of September 17, areas of Oregon near Portland showed PM<sub>2.5</sub> AQI levels up to around a hazardous 380. In regions of central California northeast of Fresno, AQI levels reached a staggering 780.</p>



<p>“Especially under conditions that we’re experiencing here in the western United States, it would be wise to <a href="https://www.airnow.gov/">check the AQI</a> on a daily basis,” says Kent Pinkerton, a biologist at University of California, Davis.</p>

A color-coded image of the small particles and chemicals produced by the wildfires (right) indicates that some areas are cloaked in heavier pollution (red) than others.</p>

</div>



<h4>What happens when people breathe in wildfire smoke?</h4>



<p>“Wildfires, through the combustion process, create lots and lots of particles” in the size range of PM<sub>2.5</sub>, says Colleen Reid, an environmental epidemiologist and health geographer at the University of Colorado Boulder. A breath of these microscopic particles can send them all the way to the alveoli, the tiny sacs where the lungs and the blood swap oxygen and carbon dioxide.</p>



<p>Research in lab dishes has found that the particles can lead to inflammation and oxidative stress, in which reactive molecules that contain oxygen build up and can damage cells. The smallest pollution particles may make their way into the bloodstream, possibly causing harm to the cardiovascular system.</p>



<p>The research linking PM<sub>2.5</sub> with health generally does not consider what types of materials are burning, so “at this point we are concerned about all PM<sub>2.5</sub> regardless of source,” says Anthony Wexler, who studies particulate pollutants at the University of California, Davis. “But the source is likely important.”</p>



<p>Historically, wildfires have burned mostly plant matter. But many of the recent devastating fires in the western U.S., such as the Camp Fire that destroyed the town of Paradise, Calif., in 2018, have <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/development-near-natural-areas-puts-more-californians-path-wildfires">devoured human-made structures</a> (<em>SN: 11/15/18</em>). “Houses have paint and solvents and plastics and all this other terrible stuff going up in smoke, too, which may be increasing the toxicity of the material that’s being emitted,” says Wexler. He is currently preparing an experiment to compare the toxicity of the smoke from burnt household materials with that from woody materials.</p>



<p>The impact of extended exposures to wildfire smoke also needs more research. Wildfires put a lot of pollution into the air, more than what’s generally produced from industrial and traffic sources, Reid says. But it’s often for a short period of time. “What’s going on right now in Oregon and Washington and California, where they’ve had essentially a week of very unhealthy levels of air pollution, is less common,” she says.</p>

<h4>What are the immediate health risks from wildfire smoke?</h4>



<p>Breathing in smoky air can irritate the respiratory tract, leading to coughing, sore throats and itchy, watery eyes. The foul air can also cause headaches and fatigue.</p>



<p>Hospital visits for lung care go up during wildfires compared to periods without them, according to studies of emergency department traffic. For instance, an increase in PM<sub>2.5 </sub>exposure related to wildfires in northern California in 2008 was associated with an increase in risk for<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27318255/"> </a><a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27318255/">emergency department visits and hospitalizations for asthma</a>, Reid and colleagues reported in <em>Environmental Research</em> in 2016. The 2012 wildfires in Colorado were linked to a rise in emergency department visits for<a href="https://ehjournal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12940-016-0146-8"> </a><a href="https://ehjournal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12940-016-0146-8">asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease</a>, according to a 2016 study in <em>Environmental Health</em>. There’s some evidence of increased trips to the hospital for cardiovascular health problems during wildfires as well.</p>



<p>Medical visits for kids go up during wildfires too. During the 2017 Lilac Fire in San Diego county, <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31860802/">visits for respiratory problems</a> to a children’s hospital rose due to increased exposure to PM<sub>2.5</sub>, according to a 2020 study in the <em>Annals of the American Thoracic Society</em>.</p>



<p>Children, especially the very young and those with diseases like asthma, can be more vulnerable to health effects from wildfires. “They breathe more air per minute compared to adults” to meet their physiological needs, says Marissa Hauptman, a pediatrician at Boston Children’s Hospital. That can add up to more exposure. And developing lungs “are more susceptible to injury,” she says. </p>



<p>A developing fetus may also be at risk from exposure to PM<sub>2.5</sub>. In a 2012 study in <em>Environmental Health Perspectives, </em>Reid and colleagues reported a<a href="https://ehp.niehs.nih.gov/doi/10.1289/ehp.1104515?url_ver=Z39.88-2003&amp;rfr_id=ori:rid:crossref.org&amp;rfr_dat=cr_pub%20%200pubmed"> </a><a href="https://ehp.niehs.nih.gov/doi/10.1289/ehp.1104515?url_ver=Z39.88-2003&amp;rfr_id=ori:rid:crossref.org&amp;rfr_dat=cr_pub%20%200pubmed">slight decrease in birth weight</a> for infants from pregnancies that occurred during the 2003 wildfires in Southern California. Mothers exposed to smoke from Colorado wildfires during the second trimester were <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6801422/">more likely to give birth prematurely</a>, according to a 2019 study in the <em>International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health</em>. Infants born early or smaller than usual can face developmental delays.</p>



<h4>What’s known about long-term health risks from wildfire smoke?</h4>



<p>Not much. But a few studies provide some initial clues.</p>



<p>One examined how wildfires that scorched large areas of Indonesia in 1997 impacted health 10 years later. This population-wide study found that males and the elderly were worse off in 2007 for health measures such as lung function, the researchers reported in <em>Economics &amp; Human Biology</em> in 2017.</p>



<p>In the United States, the wildfire smoke that plagued the Seeley Lake community in Montana in 2017 has parallels to the prolonged, hazardous exposures happening now in the West. The wildfires produced extremely high levels of PM<sub>2.5</sub> from July 31 to September 18 that year; the daily average was 221 micrograms per cubic meter of air. Christopher Migliaccio, a respiratory immunology researcher at the University of Montana in Missoula, and his colleagues screened adults in the community right after the last day of increased smoke and two more times in each of the following two years.</p>



<p>Compared with members of a Montana community that hadn’t been exposed to the same levels of smoke, the participants from the Seeley Lake area <a href="https://www.mdpi.com/2305-6304/8/3/53">had poorer lung function one and two years out</a>, Migliaccio and his colleagues reported in <em>Toxics </em>in August. “I thought people might be worse right after,” he says, “but it’s a little bit of a delayed response.”</p>



<p>Migliaccio and colleagues had planned to screen the participants again this year, but COVID-19 got in the way. Eventually they hope to see whether, in participants that still have worse lung function, the condition is treatable or if it’s “the new normal.”</p>



<h4>Can a mask protect you from wildfire smoke?</h4>



<p>It depends on the type of mask. “Cloth masks, which <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/covid-19-coronavirus-why-wearing-masks-controversial">are effective at preventing transmission</a> of SARS-CoV-2 [the virus that causes COVID-19] … don’t do anything to protect the wearer from exposure to wildfire smoke,” Balmes says (<em>SN: 6/26/20</em>). Surgical masks provide some protection. But “an N95 is the best protection.” N95 masks are designed to filter out at least 95 percent of airborne particles.</p>



<p>But N95 masks are in short supply, and those masks have not been certified for use by children as they don’t fit properly. So the best protection is to avoid exposure. “People should stay indoors as much as possible with the windows closed,” Balmes says.</p>





<h4>How can people keep indoor air clean?</h4>



<p>“If they have central ventilation, they should turn that to recirculation,” Balmes says. That can reduce the amount of smoke that enters the home. People can also use a High Efficiency Particulate Air, or HEPA purifier to smoke-proof a single room. And those who cannot afford a HEPA cleaner can put together a makeshift purifier using a MERV-13 furnace filter and a box fan, Balmes says. “They’re not as good as the proper devices, but they do provide some protection.”</p>



<p>People hunkered down indoors can also keep the air clear by not burning gas stoves or candles, or even vacuuming — which can stir up particles inside the home.</p>



<p>But some people don’t have a home to escape to. King County in Washington announced on September 11 the opening of a <a href="https://www.kingcounty.gov/elected/executive/constantine/news/release/2020/September/11-smoke-shelter.aspx">clean air shelter</a> for people experiencing homelessness.</p>



<h4>How else might wildfires be harming health?</h4>



<p>The toll that the wildfires have on mental health could also be significant. The past month in the Pacific Northwest has brought images reminiscent of a science fiction novel: hazy, deep orange skies that sometimes completely obscured the sun, turning day to night.</p>



<p>Extreme wildfires, with the potential for long periods of time in which the air is a danger, can upend people’s lives and add to stress levels. One of the few respites to the COVID-19 pandemic — going out for a breath of fresh air — has been shut off for millions of people. And there are many that have no choice but to work or live outdoors, exposed to hazardous air. “There could be a psychological impact of that,” says Reid. “That needs to be explored.”</p>

<p><em>Our weekly round-up of the best psychology coverage from elsewhere on the web</em></p>



<p><strong>You’ve probably heard of ASMR — or maybe experienced it yourself from watching videos of people doing things like whispering or rustling paper.</strong> But although such videos are incredibly popular, there have been surprisingly few studies on the phenomenon. <a href="https://theconversation.com/asmr-what-we-know-so-far-about-this-unique-brain-phenomenon-and-what-we-dont-135106">Giulia Poerio explores</a> what the research has revealed so far at <em>The Conversation</em>.</p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator" />


<p><span id="more-40336"></span></p>


<p><strong>The feelings of “dissociation” caused by drugs like ketamine seem to be related to slow, rhythmic firing patterns of brain cells in an area called the retrosplenial cortex. </strong>Researchers identified this link first in rodents, <a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2020/09/16/913565163/scientists-discover-way-to-induce-altered-state-of-mind-without-drugs">reports Jon Hamilton</a> at <em>NPR</em>, but then found that similar patterns were seen in a patient with epilepsy when they experienced dissociation. The work could help develop drugs to prevent dissociation — or induce it when it may be beneficial.</p>

<p><strong>Scientists are trying to learn more about the neurological symptoms sometimes caused by COIVD-19. </strong>At <em>Nature</em>, <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-02599-5">Michael Marshall has written a useful overview</a> of what we do and don’t know.</p>

<p><strong>Talking to strangers is not always easy, but it can benefit our wellbeing, </strong><a href="https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20200914-the-surprising-benefits-of-talking-to-strangers">writes Emily Kasriel</a> at <em>BBC Future</em><strong>. </strong>Of course, it is much harder to have meaningful encounters with strangers during a pandemic, when so many of us are staying at home in our own bubbles. But, as Kasriel points out, there have also been plenty of examples of people helping out those they don’t know during the crisis.                        </p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator" />



<p><strong>Making friends can also be hard, especially as an adult. </strong>At <em>Psyche</em>, <a href="https://psyche.co/guides/how-to-make-new-friends-when-youre-busy-with-adulthood">Marisa G Franco has some great tips</a> for establishing — and maintaining — new friendships, based on psychological research.<strong>  </strong></p>

<p><strong>Bees with specialised diets, feeding off just specific kinds of flower, have larger brains than their less discerning cousins</strong>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/15/science/bees-brains.html">reports Elizabeth Preston</a> at <em>The New York Times</em><strong>. </strong>The researchers suggest that bigger brains help these species to home in on their preferred flower when there are many options to choose from.

<p><strong>Finally, this year’s <a href="https://www.improbable.com/ig-about/">Ig Nobel</a> prizes were announced at a virtual ceremony yesterday. </strong>The annual awards celebrate the quirkier side of science: winners this year included a group which investigated the viability of knives made of human faeces (they don’t work), and another which examined how frequency of kissing was related to a nation’s level of income inequality (more inequality is associated with more kissing, apparently). In the psychology category, Miranda Giacomin and Nicholas Rule won for <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/jopy.12396">a study</a> which found that people can identify narcissists based on their distinctive eyebrows. <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2020/09/bellowing-alligators-and-frozen-poop-knives-the-2020-ig-nobel-prizes/">Jennifer Ouellette has more</a> at <em>Ars Technica</em>.</p>

<p><strong>Amoebic killers</strong> <em>—</em> <em><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/amoebic-killers">Science News</a></em>, September 19, 1970</p>



<p>A fearsome [disease] has been recognized in recent years, produced by a one-cell organism…. Mercifully, human invasion is rare, for the invader, an amoeba, destroys the brain tissue and produces death in from four to seven days. Only 50 cases are known.… This free-living amoeba, <em>Naegleria gruberi</em>, is not confined to tropical countries…. Four deaths traced to <em>Naegleria </em>occurred in 1967–69 in Virginia.</p>



<h4>Update</h4>



<p>The brain-eating amoeba, <em>Naegleria fowleri</em> — misidentified as its harmless cousin <em>N. gruberi</em> in <em>Science News</em> — causes a rare but deadly brain infection. <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/parasites/naegleria/illness.html">Just four of 145 people</a> infected with <em>N. fowleri</em> in the United States from 1962 to 2018 survived, reports the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The amoeba primarily infects people swimming in lakes and rivers, though several reported cases have been linked to contaminated tap water. Scientists are still trying to understand how the amoeba kills. “Brain-eating” may be a misnomer, recent research hints. <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/death-brain-eating-amoeba-inside-job">Death could result from the immune system’s response</a> to <em>N. fowleri</em> (<em>SN: 8/22/15, p. 14</em>).</p>

<p><em>By</em> <a href="https://emmayoung.net/">Emma Young</a></p>



<p>If you were to play your favourite song right now, I imagine you’d have little difficulty clapping along with the beat. Our appreciation of beat allows us to clap, dance, march and sway in time with a piece of music — or just with each other. As the authors of a <a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2020-63318-001">new paper</a> published in the <em>Journal of Experimental Psychology: General </em>point out, these behaviours occur spontaneously across human cultures. But while moving to a beat seems effortless, it involves all kinds of perceptual processes.</p>



<p>The team, led by Jessica E. Nave-Blodgett at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas, now report that our ability to perceive beat becomes ever more refined and also nuanced through childhood and adolescence. It may seem like an instinctive ability, but it is learned — and training does make it better.</p>


<p><span id="more-40328"></span></p>


<p>The researchers set out to explore our perceptions of both a primary beat (think of a regular metronome) and also what’s known in music as “<a href="https://www.libertyparkmusic.com/musical-time-signatures/">meter</a>“. Meter refers to more complex patterns of beats within a piece. If you’ve ever studied music and seen <strong>4/4</strong>, for example, noted at the start of a piece, this indicates that all the notes in the measure, or bar, add up to four quarter notes. Imagine, then, a beat pattern of <strong>1</strong>, 2 3, 4; <strong>1</strong>, 2, 3, 4. The organisation of beats into regular measures like this represents another level of musical structure. </p>



<p>“Perceiving meter, by definition, entails grasping multiple hierarchical levels of beat simultaneously,” the researchers note, adding: “Like beat, meter is a musical universal and it is critical for coordinating complex patterns of music across multiple individuals….A major question is when perceptual sensitivity to both beat and meter emerge during development.”</p>



<p>To try to answer this question, the team ran studies on children of varying ages and also adults who either had or had not been musically trained.</p>



<p>For the first study, they recruited 32 adults with little or no musical training and 28 musicians. Through one ear, each participant was played a series of brief excerpts of ballroom dance music. These pieces had either a 3/4 or 4/4 meter. In the other ear, they heard a low-pitched metronome. This metronome either matched or mismatched the primary beat and also played a higher-pitched click that matched or mismatched the meter (i.e. by falling on the first beat of each bar, or not). The team were able, then, to create four conditions, in which the metronome matched the music at the level of the beat or the measure or both or neither. Each time, the participants had to indicate, using a four-point scale, “how well” the click track matched the music, from “not well at all” to “very well”.</p>



<p>All the adults were sensitive to both the beat and the meter of the music, and used both to make their matching judgements. They could, then, perceive beat- and measure-level information simultaneously in the music and metronomes. The musicians in the study were slightly better at this, but the non-musicians could still do it.</p>



<p>The team then ran a very similar study on 154 children aged between 5 and 17. (The instructions were made more child-friendly for the younger ages, but the children aged 11-plus performed the task exactly as the adults had.)</p>



<p>Even the youngest children could perceive the primary beat to some degree — all the children rated beat-matching metronomes as better fitting than beat-mismatching metronomes (kids with musical training were particularly good at this). But with age, the difference in ratings for matching vs mismatched metronomes increased. As the researchers write, this suggests that sensitivity to beat-level information develops with age. (Slowly developing beat perception might explain why young kids move so erratically — if cutely — to their favourite songs.) However, the meter-level data was much more inconsistent. “It is likely that meter perception emerges gradually in late adolescence,” the team concludes, only reaching full maturity in adulthood.</p>



<p>In a follow-up study in which beat-level information was removed, 5 to 8-year-olds still couldn’t perceive any measure-level information, while 9 to 13 year-olds could. So this ability is clearly developing around this age — but it’s not yet good enough for them to use it reliably to perceive meter in complex music.</p>



<p>What might account for this pattern of development of beat and meter-level perception? It might relate to age-related improvements in cognitive skills and abilities such as language learning and working memory. But exposure to music no doubt makes a difference, too: adults are <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4429809/">much better at synchronising their movements to culturally familiar</a> than unfamiliar music, suggesting that they are better at perceiving familiar beat hierarchies.</p>



<p>Some groups of people have more trouble than others at moving to a beat, including children with dyslexia. As the researchers note, there is growing body of work linking problems with rhythm processing to language-related difficulties. Both the type of complex music used in this study and natural language have multiple levels of beat. This experimental set-up might then be useful for exploring just how particular problems with beat and meter perception may relate to <a href="https://www.acamh.org/blog/dyslexia-developmental-language-disorder-different/">difficulties reading or with grammar in spoken language</a>, as well as for further exploring the development of beat perception in all of us.</p>

<p>Watching a Virtual Reality video was found to be an effective decision-making aid for people making an advance care plan. Advance care planning offers people the opportunity to plan their future care and support, including medical treatment, while they have the capacity to do so. Legislation allowing advance care planning is relatively new in Asia and has been recently introduced in Taiwan. Taiwanese people must complete a consultation before formally documenting their wishes. However, health and legal literacy can be a barrier to people making fully-informed decisions about their future care. Wan-Ting Hsieh showed 120 people a short video in virtual reality that documented typical scenarios in end-of-life care, such as hospice home care and the withdrawal of life support. After viewing the video, participant’s preferences for not accessing the medical treatments shown and the ability to make a decision about their future care increased. The study provides evidence for how VR tools could be further rolled out as decision-making aids and bridge gaps in health and legal literacy for important decisions about their future.</p>

<p><img alt="Watching TV" class="wp-image-12115 size-medium alignleft" height="200" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2020/09/Sedentary-300x200.jpg" width="300" />Sedentary behaviors rose between 2002 and 2017 in the European Union, particularly in men. Sedentary behavior is an important risk factor for mortality and continues to be a public health challenge with significant health, social and economic consequences. López-Valenciano <em>et al. </em>analyzed data that surveyed European Union adult citizen’s physical activity and sedentary behaviors. In 2002, half of those surveyed were inactive for more than 4.5 hours each day; by 2017 this had risen to 54.5%. The researchers suggested a number of factors could account for this increase in sedentary behavior, such as longer commutes and labor-saving devices at home and work. The authors also attributed people’s interaction with technology such as smartphones and streaming services with increasing physical inactivity. The study provides supporting data for strengthening public health policies and international efforts to tackle rises in sedentary behavior.</p>

Polar bears rapidly evolved several traits from its closest living relative, the brown bear, that has promoted the species’ survival in arctic environments. Castruita <em>et al. </em>studied the genomic mechanisms underpinning how these characteristics were selected in polar bears by analyzing the genomes of more than 100 polar bears and 33 brown bears. The analysis revealed that a combination of standing variation in ancestral gene pools and <em>de novo </em>mutations in polar bear lineages may have promoted the rapid adaption of polar bears to arctic environments. The study provides a comprehensive assessment of the genomic mechanisms behind how polar bears rapidly adapted to the Arctic.</p>

In an effort to flatten peaks of COVID-19 infections, governments have introduced various non-pharmaceutical interventions, such as social distancing, lockdowns, and the use of face-coverings. However, how much of a positive impact these interventions have relies on community understanding, engagement, and compliance. Seale <em>et al. </em>conducted a rapid review of the literature to study the factors that impact community engagement with government interventions. The emerging theme identified by the review was how can an environment be created that supports and promotes the adoption of non-pharmaceutical interventions in the community? The authors suggest integrating community co-design of supporting communications and materials to promote engagement and compliance with interventions.</p>

Registering a systematic review protocol promotes transparency, prevents bias, and duplication of work. Cochrane and other bodies recommend prospectively registering systematic review protocols but journals do not mandate it, contrasting with their registration requirements for clinical trials. Tawfik <em>et al. </em>surveyed 270 systematic review and meta-analysis authors to assess researchers’ knowledge and attitudes towards systematic review protocol registration.

                <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/footprints-oldest-evidence-humans-arabian-peninsula">Seven footprints may be the oldest evidence of humans on the Arabian Peninsula</a></h4>

<p>Footprints discovered at what was once a rain-fed lake in Saudi Arabia’s Nefud Desert suggest that humans on the move made a pit stop there more than 100,000 years ago. </p>



<p>The seven human footprints <a href="https://advances.sciencemag.org/lookup/doi/10.1126/sciadv.aba8940">are likely the oldest evidence of <em>Homo sapiens</em> on the Arabian Peninsula</a>, a new study finds. Dating sediment from above and below the foot impressions places them around 112,000 to 121,000 years old, researchers report September 18 in <em>Science Advances</em>. <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/finger-fossil-puts-people-arabia-least-86000-years-ago">The previous oldest evidence of humans in the region</a> dates to at least 86,000 years ago (<em>SN: 4/9/18</em>).</p>



<p>Elsewhere in Saudi Arabia, researchers have found <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/hints-earlier-human-exit-africa">stone tools like those made by African <em>H. sapiens</em></a> that date to around 125,000 years ago (<em>SN: 1/27/11</em>), raising the likelihood that the newly discovered footprints were made by humans.</p>



<p>Ancient <em>H. sapiens</em> groups likely used the site, known as Alathar, as a watering hole and place to forage for food in surrounding grasslands, say biologist Mathew Stewart of the Max Planck Institute for Chemical Ecology in Jena, Germany and colleagues. Sediment analyses suggest ancient people reached the lake during a dry stretch when the region’s rivers and lakes were shrinking.</p>



<p>Other finds at the site dating to the same period include 107 camel footprints and 43 elephant footprints. Those impressions were made by herds of juvenile and adult animals, the scientists say. Fossils eroding out of footprint-bearing sediment included remains of elephants and large gazelles called oryxes, but not humans.</p>

<p>Although humans might have hunted at the lake, the researchers found no stone tools or animal bones bearing butchery marks. Ancient people probably stopped briefly at Alathar, perhaps while following herds of elephants or other creatures through the region, the researchers say.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/underwater-earthquakes-sound-waves-ocean-warming-climate-change">Underwater earthquakes’ sound waves reveal changes in ocean warming</a></h4>

<p>Sound waves traveling thousands of kilometers through the ocean may help scientists monitor climate change.</p>



<p>As greenhouse gas emissions warm the planet, the ocean is absorbing vast amounts of that heat. To monitor the change, a global fleet of about 4,000 devices called Argo floats is collecting temperature data from the ocean’s upper 2,000 meters. But that data collection is scanty in some regions, including deeper reaches of the ocean and areas under sea ice.</p>



<p>So Wenbo Wu, a seismologist at Caltech, and colleagues are resurfacing a decades-old idea: using the speed of sound in seawater to estimate ocean temperatures. In a new study, Wu’s team developed and tested a way to use earthquake-generated sound waves traveling across the East Indian Ocean to estimate temperature changes in those waters from 2005 to 2016.</p>



<p>Comparing that data with similar information from Argo floats and computer models showed that the new results matched well. That finding suggests that <a href="https://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/doi/10.1126/science.abb9519">the technique, dubbed seismic ocean thermometry, holds promise</a> for tracking the impact of climate change on less well-studied ocean regions, the researchers report in the Sept. 18 <em>Science</em>.</p>





<p>Sound waves are carried through water by the vibration of water molecules, and at higher temperatures, those molecules vibrate more easily. As a result, the waves travel a bit faster when the water is warmer. But those changes are so small that, to be measurable, researchers need to track the waves over very long distances.</p>



<p>Fortunately, sound waves can travel great distances through the ocean, thanks to a curious phenomenon known as the SOFAR Channel, short for Sound Fixing and Ranging. Formed by different salinity and temperature layers within the water, the SOFAR channel is a horizontal layer that acts as a wave guide, guiding sound waves in much the same way that optical fibers guide light waves, Wu says. The waves bounce back and forth against the upper and lower boundaries of the channel, but can continue on their way, virtually unaltered, for <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/undersea-sounds-span-12000-miles">tens of thousands of kilometers</a> (<em>SN: 7/16/60</em>).</p>



<p>In 1979, physical oceanographers <a href="https://scripps.ucsd.edu/news/obituary-notice-walter-munk-world-renowned-oceanographer-revered-scientist">Walter Munk</a>, then at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography in La Jolla, Calif., and Carl Wunsch, now an emeritus professor at both MIT and Harvard University, came up with a plan to use these ocean properties to measure water temperatures from surface to seafloor, a technique they called “<a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/0198-0149(79)90073-6">ocean acoustic tomography</a>.” They would <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/climate-test-hum-heard-round-world">transmit sound signals through the SOFAR Channel</a> and measure the time that it took for the waves to arrive at receivers located 10,000 kilometers away. In this way, the researchers hoped to compile a global database of ocean temperatures (<em>SN: 1/26/1991</em>).</p>



<p>But <a href="https://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/doi/10.1126/science.abe0960">environmental groups lobbied against and ultimately halted the experiment</a>, stating that the human-made signals might have adverse effects on marine mammals, as Wunsch notes in a commentary in the same issue of <em>Science</em>.</p>



<p>Forty years later, scientists have determined that the ocean is in fact a very noisy place, and that the proposed human-made signals would have been faint compared with the rumbles of quakes, the belches of undersea volcanoes and the groans of colliding icebergs, says seismologist Emile Okal of Northwestern University in Evanston, Ill., who was not involved in the new study.</p>



<p>Still, Wu and colleagues have devised a work-around that sidesteps any environmental concerns: Rather than use human-made signals, they employ earthquakes. When an undersea earthquake rumbles, it releases energy as seismic waves known as P waves and S waves that vibrate through the seafloor. Some of that energy enters the water, and when it does, the seismic waves slow down, becoming T waves.</p>



<p>Those T waves can also travel along the SOFAR Channel. So, to track changes in ocean temperature, Wu and colleagues identified “repeaters” — earthquakes that the team determined to originate from the same location, but occurring at different times. The East Indian Ocean, Wu says, was chosen for this proof-of-concept study largely because it’s very seismically active, offering an abundance of such earthquakes. After identifying over 2,000 repeaters from 2005 to 2016, the team then measured differences in the sound waves’ travel time across the East Indian Ocean, a span of some 3,000 kilometers. </p>



<p>The data revealed a slight warming trend in the waters, of about 0.044 degrees Celsius per decade. That trend is similar to, though a bit faster than, the one indicated by real-time temperatures collected by Argo floats. Wu says the team next plans to test the technique with receivers that are farther away, including off of Australia’s west coast.</p>



<p>That extra distance will be important to prove that the new method works, Okal says. “It’s a fascinating study,” he says, but the distances involved are very short as far as T waves go, and the temperature changes being estimated are very small. That means that any uncertainty in matching the precise origins of two repeater quakes could translate to uncertainty in the travel times, and thus the temperature changes. But future studies over greater distances could help mitigate this concern, he says.</p>



<p>The new study is “really breaking new ground,” says Frederik Simons, a geophysicist at Princeton University, who was not involved in the research. “They’ve really worked out a good way to tease out very subtle, slow temporal changes. It’s technically really savvy.”</p>



<p>And, Simons adds, in many locations seismic records are decades older than the temperature records collected by Argo floats. That means that scientists may be able to use seismic ocean thermometry to come up with new estimates of past ocean temperatures. “The hunt will be on for high-quality archival records.”</p>

<p>To better understand how widely the coronavirus has spread in the United States, some researchers are turning to an unusual source of data: blood donations.</p>



<p>In an effort to encourage more donations, many blood collection centers have been offering to test donated blood for <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/covid-19-coronavirus-what-antibody-tests-tell-us">antibodies to the coronavirus</a>, which indicates a past infection with SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19. Of the nearly 1 million Americans who donated blood to the Red Cross from June 15 to August 23 and were tested, <a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2770771?alert=article">only 1.82 percent had the antibodies</a>. That finding suggests that the vast majority of Americans have yet to be infected with the virus, researchers report September 14 in <em>JAMA</em>.</p>



<p>Blood donations aren’t a random sample of the population, but the data can give researchers an idea how much of a population has been exposed to the virus, a concept known as seroprevalence, and how susceptible different populations remain to continuing outbreaks.</p>

<p>While seroprevalence was generally low across the country, there was variation among different demographic groups. African-American and Hispanic donors had slightly higher seroprevalence, compared with white donors, which matches patterns seen in clinical diagnoses of COVID-19.  </p>



<p>Seroprevalence varied by region too. All regions except the Northeast experienced modest increases in seroprevalence over the course of the summer. By August 23, the South had a seroprevalence of about 2.9 percent, higher than the Midwest (about 2.7 percent) or West (about 2.4 percent) or Northeast (about 2.1 percent).</p>

In England in 2017, more than 124,000 people died from CVD<a href="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/feed/#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1"><sup>[1]</sup></a>. Changing behaviors related to diet, physical activity, smoking and alcohol intake can reduce CVD risk. The delivery of interventions targeting these behaviors also often requires healthcare professional (HCP) behaviors to change.</p>
<p><strong>The NHS Health Check</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>It is important to understand the extent to which positive behaviors are influenced across the NHS Health Check pathway</p></blockquote>
<p>The NHS Health Check (NHSHC), introduced in the English National Health Service (NHS) in 2009, is a national prevention program offered to adults 40-74 years old with the aim of helping them reduce their chance of having a heart attack or stroke through behavior change and, where appropriate, clinical treatment. Since then, national evaluations have highlighted the need to maximize the program’s impact by improving coverage and outputs. To address these challenges, it is important to understand the extent to which positive behaviors are influenced across the NHS Health Check pathway and encourage the promotion or minimization of behavioral facilitators and barriers respectively.</p>
<p><strong>Our study</strong></p>
<p>To date research has tended to focus on single populations, e.g. patients or GPs, and specific behaviors, e.g. attending an NHS Health Check. A synthesis of these studies would provide an overarching behavioral picture of those involved in delivery and receipt of NHS Health Checks and so provide the foundations for intervention refinement and development. Our goal was to apply behavioral science frameworks to: i) identify behaviors and actors relevant to uptake, delivery and follow up of NHS Health Checks and influences on these behaviors and ii) signpost to example intervention content.</p>
<blockquote><p>The most frequently identified influences were physical opportunity including HCPs having space and time to deliver NHS Health Checks and patients having money to adhere to recommendations to change diet and physical activity.</p></blockquote>
<p>We identified 37 studies reporting nine behaviors and influences for eight of these. The most frequently identified influences were physical opportunity including HCPs having space and time to deliver NHS Health Checks and patients having money to adhere to recommendations to change diet and physical activity. Other key influences were motivational, such as beliefs about consequences about the value of NHS Health Checks and behavior change, and social, such as influences of others on behavior change. The following techniques are suggested for websites or smartphone apps: Adding objects to the environment, e.g. provide HCPs with electronic schedules to guide timely delivery of Health Checks to target physical opportunity, Social support (unspecified), e.g. include text suggesting patients to ask a colleague to agree in advance to join them in taking the ‘healthy option’ lunch at work; Information about health consequences, e.g. quotes and/or videos from patients talking about the health benefits of changes they have made.</p>
<p><strong>Future work</strong></p>
<p>It should be noted that the recommendations flowing from our findings reflect the types of interventions that we would expect on theoretical grounds to be effective, and this is not a review of effectiveness of interventions. Additional work needs to be done to investigate the extent to which interventions to promote NHS Health Check behaviors target the barriers and facilitators identified in this review. This work would identify any missed opportunities for intervention and inform intervention design and refinement.</p>
<blockquote><p>This is the first study, to our knowledge, to apply theoretical models to studies focusing solely on influences on NHS Health Check behaviors and to make specific evidence-informed recommendations</p></blockquote>
<p>This is the first study, to our knowledge, to apply theoretical models to studies focusing solely on influences on NHS Health Check behaviors and to make specific evidence-informed recommendations for commissioners and providers, which should be considered as part of the forthcoming NHS Health Check review in order to ensure the program is implemented as effectively as possible for the next 10 years and beyond.<a href="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/feed/#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1"><sup>[2]</sup></a></p>

<p><em>By</em> <a href="https://twitter.com/mattbwarren">Matthew Warren</a></p>



<p>Imagine that you’re an official faced with an unenviable decision: you must choose whether to establish a farm on existing land which can produce enough to feed 100 hungry families, or cut down an acre of rainforest to create a larger farm able to feed 500 hungry families. What choice would you make?</p>



<p>If you chose <em>not </em>to cut down the rainforest, you’re in the majority. In a <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/0956797620948821">new paper</a> in <em>Psychological Science</em>, participants tended to avoid choosing to harm the rainforest, despite the benefits it would bring. This isn’t surprising: time and again, researchers have found that we will <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2014/11/28/a-shocking-result-people-are-more-willing-to-hurt-themselves-than-others-for-profit/">avoid causing harm</a> if possible.</p>



<p>Now imagine that your choice is made harder. There’s no free land left; you <em>have </em>to cut down some of the rainforest. Would you cut down one acre to feed 100 families, or two acres to feed 500?</p>



<p>It’s an interesting question, because although researchers believe we’re generally averse to causing harm, they hadn’t really studied how we make decisions when some amount of harm is unavoidable.  And, perhaps surprisingly, in this second scenario almost 80% of people chose to do <em>more</em> damage, cutting down two acres of forest rather than one. In fact, across five other studies as well, Jonathan Berma from London Business School and Daniella Kupor from Boston University find that in situations where harm is unavoidable, people consistently try to maximise the social benefit, rather than minimise the amount of harm caused.</p>


<p><span id="more-40314"></span></p>


<p>Most of the studies followed the same method as the rainforest one: participants either saw a scenario in which harm was avoidable but choosing to cause harm produced greater social benefit, or one in which it was unavoidable and choosing to do<em> more </em>harm produced greater social benefit.</p>



<p>For instance, in one experiment participants imagined they were a doctor deciding whether to pull a dying child off life-support to save money for cancer research. In the “avoidable” condition, they could either choose to do nothing, or to pull life support from a single child to save $60,000. In the “unavoidable” condition, they could pull life support from a single child to save $800, or from two children to save $50,000. Only 29% chose to pull life support in the avoidable condition, but 70% pulled both children off life support in the unavoidable scenario.</p>



<p>It’s important to note that in the experiments the benefit of committing harm was similar in both the “avoidable” and “unavoidable” conditions. Consider the rainforest dilemma: in both cases, adding an extra one acre of destruction (from 0 to 1 acre in the first scenario or from 1 to 2 acres in the second) would help feed 400 more families. So if the gains associated with doing the most harm are similar in each scenario, why are people’s decisions so different?</p>



<p>To examine this further, the researchers explicitly asked participants how much they made their decisions based on a desire to do as little harm as possible versus a desire to ensure that the harm they inflicted provided sufficient benefits. They found that in the scenario where harm was avoidable, participants’ decisions were guided more by a desire to reduce harm — but this flipped in the unavoidable condition, in which decision-making was guided more by a desire to maximise the benefits of doing harm. “Thus, value trade-offs that decision-makers refuse to accept when it is possible to completely avoid committing harm can suddenly become desirable when some harm must be committed,” the authors write.</p>



<p>A final study found that even “protected values” — those that people consider absolute and unchangeable — can be overridden in situations where harm is unavoidable. People who believed that it was unacceptable to cut down tropical rainforest “no matter how great the benefits” tended to avoid destroying an acre of rainforest to build five water treatment facilities when the alternative was to build a single facility without harming the forest. But when it was a choice between destroying one acre for one facility versus two acres for five facilities, even this group went for the more damaging but more socially beneficial option.</p>



<p>Overall then, the paper suggests that we’re less harm-averse than previous studies have implied, at least when it comes to decisions where there is no possibility of avoiding harm altogether. Why does this matter? Well, the authors write, we are constantly faced with decisions that force us to choose between options that have harms as well as benefits. You want some ice cream but there’s no shop in walking distance: should you drive to the nearest supermarket, keeping your carbon emissions to a minimum? Or, as you have to drive anyway, why not go an extra couple of miles to that fancy supermarket with the really nice ice cream, increasing the amount of harm you are doing to the environment, but also maximising the benefits? The study suggests the latter decision might be more likely — so it will be interesting to see whether the findings do hold up for these kinds of real life decisions too.</p>

                <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/~r/plos/Blog/~3/GycEZabM7cM/">Transparency and Trust: Peer Review Week 2020</a></h4>

<p><em>This post is written by PLOS’ Chief Scientific Officer Veronique Kiermer</em></p>



<p>Peer Review Week is a time to celebrate the outstanding work of reviewers across the scholarly ecosystem. But it also serves as a call to action to examine the systems we have in place and opportunities to improve. </p>



<p>This peer review week, the theme couldn’t feel more timely. Trust in science, and peer review more specifically has taken the spotlight as doctors, researchers, and policymakers around the world collaborate to rapidly expand and communicate emerging knowledge about COVID-19. </p>



<p>At the same time, the advent of preprints in biomedical sciences has created <a href="https://doi.org/10.31222/osf.io/kabux">new challenges</a> to evaluate findings outside the traditional framework of journal peer review, and high profile journal retractions have contributed to raise doubts about the effectiveness of <a href="https://www.statnews.com/2020/06/04/lancet-retracts-major-covid-19-paper-that-raised-safety-concerns-about-malaria-drugs/">pre-publication peer review</a>. With the flood of information pouring in, public readers and researchers alike face the same question: how do I identify information I can trust? </p>



<p><strong>Does Peer Review Work?</strong></p>



<p>Peer review has long been a staple of the credibility of scientific findings for <a href="https://doi.org/10.1087/20140206">researchers </a>and for <a href="https://pewrsr.ch/2Hgq31S">the public</a>.  The process embodies the norm of organized skepticism that helps generate trust in scientific findings—by testing the rigor of thinking and experimentation, and by providing authors with expert feedback to build on. But importantly, peer review is more than the traditional view of pre-publication peer review conducted behind closed doors. Peer review does not stop with publication—in many ways, it only starts there. </p>



<p>Recently, in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, we’ve seen researchers rapidly come together <em>after</em> the publication of high-stake results and point out serious methodological flaws which have led to retractions of articles and withdrawals of preprints. Social media has been an unconventional, yet instrumental tool in coordinated reactions. Some have argued this is a failure of peer review, but we believe it’s actually a celebration of peer review in different forms. </p>



<p><strong>A broader view of peer review</strong></p>



<p>While post-publication peer review remains rare, preprints offer new opportunities to leverage the community in order to address the challenges and limitations of traditional peer review. For example, reviewers and editors commonly acknowledge that it is increasingly difficult to cover all the bases of expertise required to properly analyze articles that have become much more multidisciplinary. Preprint commenting while the article is under review is one possible solution <a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2019/11/community-comments-and-peer-review-a-preprint-commenting-pilot-at-plos/">we’ve encouraged</a> to address this gap, by opening up the opportunity for any researcher, anywhere in the world to volunteer their expertise, for consideration by the editor. While commenting on preprints is still rare, it could allow journals to channel within the traditional process the energy that the community already puts in scrutinizing new findings within their specialty before they are formally published in journals. </p>



<p>Preprints and preprint commenting can also help with another challenge of journal review: speed. PLOS journals offer authors the option to post preprints on their behalf at submission—after minimal checks for any content with potential to cause harm—so their findings can be disseminated while the journal curation process takes place.  We also participate in initiatives like Review Commons to provide journal-agnostic reviews that can <a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2019/09/partnering-to-streamline-review/">accelerate the peer review process</a> at the author’s destination journal and alleviate the strain of repeated reviews on the peer reviewer community.</p>



<p>Beyond these practical issues, we must consider systemic challenges and in particular the <a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/400515v1">documented biases</a> in peer review. At PLOS we acknowledge the need to improve the diversity of our reviewer pool to help mitigate such biases and we are <a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2020/07/our-commitment-to-diversity-equity-and-inclusion/">committed to this work</a>. </p>



<p><strong>Transparency, transparency, transparency </strong></p>



<p>An important prerequisite for all peer review mechanisms to work as effectively as they can is transparency. </p>



<p>Transparency facilitates trust. Working to make every step of the research and publication process as Open as possible gives journals, peer reviewers, and the scholarly community more broadly, the means for scrutiny, and a clear understanding of limitations. At the same time, it gives readers deeper insight into the scientific process and the various checkpoints that uphold it. </p>



<p>From an author’s perspective, increasing transparency means making all relevant data, code, methodologies, and reagents available so that the scholarly community—starting with reviewers—can validate and reproduce the findings independently. A <a href="https://osf.io/preprints/metaarxiv/kabux/">recent survey</a> by the Center for Open Science indicated that researchers judging preprint credibility were influenced by cues related to open data, code and other openness measures, as well as independent verification of authors claims. </p>



<p>Publishing peer review reports as well is important as it makes evident what aspects of the article were (and were not) thoroughly scrutinized pre-publication. All PLOS journals now encourage their authors to publish their peer review history alongside the article, and the <a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2020/06/published-peer-review-1-year-across-plos/">uptake is promising</a>.</p>



<p><strong>Peer review needs better recognition </strong></p>



<p>Transparency in peer review is also crucial to recognizing peer review as a first-rate academic output. It is time for this activity, essential to the scientific process, to be considered a scientific output in its own right and to take its due place in the context of research and researchers assessment. With published peer review reports, individual reviewers can choose to take credit by revealing their identity. But recognizing that there are circumstances that call for anonymity, even unnamed reviewers should have this opportunity, and tools like ORCID and Publons allow them to demonstrate their contributions as part of their academic profile. </p>



<p>There’s always more we can do to provide the motivation and support for reviewers’ work. Peer review transparency and other visual signs of recognition are a way to start helping researchers leverage their  peer review expertise to advance their careers. </p>



<p><strong>Earning trust in peer review</strong></p>



<p>Despite its challenges, the traditional journal peer review process offers important opportunities to ensure fairness in peer review. And journals have a collective responsibility to make use of these opportunities. First and foremost, we can ensure that every paper reporting a rigorously designed and executed study is peer reviewed—not only the high-stakes findings and the work of well known authors. We can also take proactive measures to limit bias, such as increasing the diversity of reviewer pools, and managing competing interests. We can foster consistent review criteria, and supplement the volunteer peer review reports with additional scrutiny for elements like statistics or ethical research practices. </p>



<p>In sum, I believe there are complementary benefits of journal-organized peer review and the process that can take place more organically in the research community post-publication—whether the publication is in a journal or on a preprint server. With more transparency in the system, we can take advantage of all mechanisms of peer review to decide what to trust, and importantly peer review itself can deserve our trust. </p>

<p><a href="https://amzn.to/3c2Lrqe">The Origins of You</a><br /><em>Jay Belsky, Avshalom Caspi, Terrie E. Moffitt and Richie Poulton<br />Harvard Univ., $35</em></p>



<p>Everyone has an opinion about what makes people, especially the troublemakers, who they are. Bad parents, bad genes, bad society, bad luck, bad decisions — pick your poison.</p>



<p>Starting several decades ago, four psychologists decided to examine how individuals flourish or flounder over the long run. Instead of jumping into a seemingly endless academic scrum over “nature versus nurture,” they studied how children actually develop over years and decades. Jay Belsky, Avshalom Caspi, Terrie Moffitt and Richie Poulton describe provocative insights from their investigations in <em>The Origins of You</em>.</p>





<p>Developmental researchers acknowledge that many personal and social factors interact throughout life. No single factor can explain, say, why one person pursues a life of crime and another excels in college. Life events and random circumstances tug kids in different directions, making various outcomes more or less probable but never dictating outcomes, the authors emphasize.</p>



<p>Only prospective studies can begin to illuminate the winding paths youngsters travel to become their adult selves. Much of <em>The Origins of You </em>concerns a project — now run by Caspi, Moffitt and Poulton — that has assessed about 1,000 New Zealanders in the town of Dunedin from birth to age 38 (data to age 45 is coming soon). The book also focuses on a study, started by Moffitt and Caspi, that has evaluated more than 1,000 pairs of British twins from ages 5 to 18, as well as another study, in which Belsky was involved, that followed about 1,300 U.S. children from birth to age 15. These investigations are among the few that have assessed a range of psychological and physical measures from childhood into adolescence and beyond.</p>





<p>One intriguing finding from these studies suggests that only certain childhood temperaments influence teenage personality and behavior. Dunedin kids deemed “undercontrolled,” irritable and distractible, at age 3 were typically impulsive and danger-seeking at age 18. “Inhibited” youngsters, however, tagged as shy, fearful and unresponsive to others at age 3, later were generally restrained and passive with others. Those two groups made up just 18 percent of the Dunedin sample.</p>



<p>Children play an active part in shaping their social worlds, likely explaining in large part why these particular childhood temperaments were so closely aligned with later personality, the authors suggest. Long-term Dunedin data indicate, for instance, that undercontrolled kids provoked hostility in parents, peers and teachers. A vicious cycle of rejection by others played out in which undercontrolled youngsters never had opportunities to learn social skills and self-control. Inhibited children, in contrast, avoided chances to make friends in new situations and to stand out academically or socially in school. By young adulthood, these kids had no clue how to influence or lead others.</p>



<p>For the remaining 82 percent of the Dunedin youngsters, the researchers found only weak links between age 3 temperament — say, being outgoing and confident or reserved but willing to interact with others — and personality 15 years later. In those cases, kids were able to connect with adults and peers throughout childhood regardless of temperament.</p>



<p>Later in life, the undercontrolled 3-year-olds faced the worst prospects. Those individuals had volatile, unstable relationships with family, friends, romantic partners and coworkers by age 21; males in that group were especially likely to develop gambling problems by age 32.</p>



<p>Other findings from the three studies cover a lot of ground. Consider the following: Good or bad parenting predicts how girls, but not boys, will relate as adults to their own 3-year-olds. Regular marijuana use starting in the teen years harms mental health far more than physical health. As physical abuse and other childhood adversities add up, individuals become more likely to suffer a rapid decline in many markers of biological age — including immune, kidney and heart function — by their 20s and to suffer from poor health by age 38.</p>



<p>Refreshingly, the authors acknowledge that the science of human development is not advanced enough to make pronouncements about how to raise children. Disappointingly, the authors offer few peeks at their personal backgrounds and how they ended up doing what they do. Despite that gap, and the inability of these findings to address development in non-Western cultures, after finishing the book, I couldn’t help but wonder what will happen as these people, tracked since childhood, enter the second half of their lives.</p>

<p class="">The subthalamic nucleus is a small collection of neurons situated <a href="https://www.neuroscientificallychallenged.com/directional-terms#ventral" target="_blank">ventral</a> to the <a href="https://www.neuroscientificallychallenged.com/glossary/thalamus" target="_blank">thalamus</a> (i.e., below the thalamus). It is a major component of the <a href="https://www.neuroscientificallychallenged.com/glossary/subthalamus" target="_blank">subthalamus</a>.</p><p class="" data-rte-preserve-empty="true"></p><h2>What is the subthalamic nucleus and what does it do?</h2><p class="">The subthalamic nucleus is considered part of the <a href="https://www.neuroscientificallychallenged.com/glossary/basal-ganglia" target="_blank">basal ganglia</a>. The basal ganglia are a group of <a href="https://www.neuroscientificallychallenged.com/glossary/subcortical" target="_blank">subcortical</a> nuclei that are involved in a variety of cognitive and emotional functions, but are best known for their role in movement. The precise contributions of the basal ganglia to movement still aren’t fully understood, but one popular hypothesis suggests that the basal ganglia play a critical role in facilitating desired movements, while at the same time inhibiting unwanted and/or competing movements. To read more about the basal ganglia and this purported function, see <a href="https://www.neuroscientificallychallenged.com/blog/what-are-basal-ganglia" target="_blank">this article</a>. </p><p class="">The subthalamic nucleus is considered a critical component of basal ganglia circuits that are devoted to the suppression of unwanted movements. These inhibitory circuits are known as the <a href="https://www.neuroscientificallychallenged.com/glossary/indirect-pathway" target="_blank">indirect pathway</a> and the <a href="https://www.neuroscientificallychallenged.com/glossary/hyperdirect-pathway" target="_blank">hyperdirect pathway</a>. In both pathways, the inhibition of movement is thought to be traceable back to excitatory <a href="https://www.neuroscientificallychallenged.com/glossary/glutamate" target="_blank">glutamate </a>neurons that extend from the subthalamic nucleus to stimulate <a href="https://www.neuroscientificallychallenged.com/glossary/gaba" target="_blank">GABA</a> neurons in the <a href="https://www.neuroscientificallychallenged.com/glossary/globus-pallidus" target="_blank">globus pallidus</a> and <a href="https://www.neuroscientificallychallenged.com/glossary/substantia-nigra" target="_blank">substantia nigra</a>; these GABA neurons in turn exert an inhibitory influence over neurons in the thalamus that typically prompt movement when they’re excited. </p><p class="">Watch this video to learn more about the indirect pathway, a circuit in the basal ganglia that includes the subthalamic nucleus and is thought to play an important role in the inhibition of movement.</p><p class="">The subthalamic nucleus’ role in suppressing unwanted movements may be critical even for the simplest movements. If, for example, you are reaching out to pick up a cup of coffee, your brain must not only activate the muscles necessary for the movement, but inhibit those that would counteract the desired movement. Indeed, even when you are sitting still, unwanted movements (like your hand jerking involuntarily up in the air) must continuously be subdued by your brain. It has been hypothesized that the subthalamic nucleus plays an important role in these types of movement inhibition.</p><p class="">It’s important to note, however, that the functions of the subthalamic nucleus (and basal ganglia as a whole) are not limited to movement. Recent research suggests the subthalamic nucleus may also contribute to <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16249050/" target="_blank">cognitive functions like decision-making, attention, and working memory</a> (among others). And the <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16249050/" target="_blank">subthalamic nucleus may be part of circuits that have important influences on emotion</a> as well. </p><p class="">Some of our understanding of these more extensive roles for the subthalamic nucleus come from studies involving <a href="https://www.neuroscientificallychallenged.com/glossary/deep-brain-stimulation-dbs" target="_blank">deep brain stimulation</a>, or DBS. DBS is a surgical procedure that involves implanting an electrode in the brain. Once the electrode is in place, it can be prompted to emit electrical impulses that are hypothesized to interfere with neural activity.</p><p class="">DBS has been found to be especially useful in the treatment of <a href="https://www.neuroscientificallychallenged.com/glossary/parkinsons-disease" target="_blank">Parkinson’s disease</a>. Parkinson’s disease is characterized by movement problems like slow, effortful movement, and difficulty initiating movements. It is believed that some of these movement-related symptoms stem from overactivity in the subthalamic nucleus. This increased subthalamic nucleus activity may lead to excessive inhibition of movement via the basal ganglia circuits mentioned above. </p><p class="">Thus, when the electrode in DBS is positioned in or near the subthalamic nucleus, turning the device on can disrupt the inhibitory actions of the subthalamic nucleus and facilitate movement. To learn more about DBS, <a href="https://www.neuroscientificallychallenged.com/blog//deep-brain-stimulation-parkinsons-disease-mechanism" target="_blank">see this article</a>.</p><p class="">As mentioned above, the use of DBS has also helped us to appreciate the complexity of the roles of the subthalamic nucleus. Many patients who receive DBS experience not only an improvement of their Parkinsonian symptoms, but also develop side effects that include cognitive and emotional changes <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12371602/" target="_blank">like memory disturbances and apathy</a>. It has been proposed that disruption of the function of the subthalamic nucleus might be responsible for these side effects of DBS. It should be said, however, that <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12371602/" target="_blank">variability in the side effects of DBS</a>—as well as a poor understanding of exactly how DBS affects brain activity—makes it difficult to say this with certainty.</p><p class="">Regardless, the evidence collected to date suggests that the subthalamic nucleus is an important area of the brain for motor control and a variety of other actions. Future research will be needed, however, to fully understand the functions of this small—but important—collection of neurons.<br /></p><h3><strong>References (in addition to linked text above):</strong></h3><p class="">Bonnevie T, Zaghloul KA.

<p><em>By</em> <a href="https://emmayoung.net/">Emma Young</a></p>



<p>As everyone knows, American undergrads are not representative of all humanity — and the perils of drawing conclusions about people in general from <a href="https://www.apa.org/monitor/2010/05/weird">WEIRD studies</a> have been well-publicised. To really understand which human experiences are universal, and which are a product of our individual cultures, we need big, well-conducted studies of people from many different cultures. Fortunately, there are studies like this. Here are some of their most fascinating insights…</p>


<p><span id="more-40304"></span></p>


<p><strong>Personal space</strong></p>



<p>How big is your “personal space”? As a Brit, I’d expect mine to be larger than that of the average Italian’s, say. That’s because I know there are studies finding that people living in cultures that favour physical contact tend to have smaller “personal bubbles”. However, until recently, decent cross-cultural analyses of this concept had been lacking. </p>



<p>That changed with a 2017 paper on “Preferred interpersonal distances” in the <a href="https://bib.irb.hr/datoteka/873645.sorokowska_et_al_2017.pdf"><em>Journal of Cross-Cultural Psychology</em></a> from authors representing a total of 59 institutions, based everywhere from Beijing to Uruguay to Iran. In total, the team, led by Agnieszka Sorokowska, collected data on almost 9000 participants from 42 countries. They looked at preferences for “social distance” (physical distance when interacting with a stranger), “personal distance” (when with an acquaintance), and “intimate distance” (when interacting with a family member, for example). </p>



<p>There were positive correlations between all three measures, but especially between the first two: people who preferred to stand closer to a stranger also tended to like being closer to an acquaintance. And when it came to country-by-country variations, the team found some big differences. People in Argentina had the smallest bubbles: they were happy for acquaintances to get within about 60 cm, and allowed close friends and family about another 15 cm nearer. England and the US fell about a third of the way up the acceptable distance chart — people in England preferred acquaintances to stay about 20 cm further away than Argentinians did, for example. The list was topped, though, by Romania, Hungary and Saudi Arabia. The average Hungarian’s preferred personal distance was almost <em>twice</em> that of the average Argentinian’s.</p>



<p>Exactly what might drive these country differences isn’t clear. But the team did note that, on the whole, women, older people and residents of colder countries preferred to keep strangers further at bay. Right now, however, Covid-19 means that of course we’re all used to more personal space than normal. But fear of the virus, along with long, stressful periods in lockdown, have led to a doubling in the personal distances perceived as comfortable among people in Lombardy, the region of Italy most affected by the virus, according to Tina Iachini at the University of Campania. “Social distance is like an invisible buffer around us that we always carry,” <a href="https://newseu.cgtn.com/news/2020-05-03/COVID-19-means-we-all-want-more-personal-space-Q9hylaKKcg/index.html">she’s been quoted as saying</a>. “It is our shield of safety and that is why we are so sensitive to the safety value of this space.”</p>



<p><strong>Emotion terms  </strong></p>



<p>What does “anger” or “happiness” mean to you? And do these, and other emotion labels, mean essentially the same thing to an English-speaker as their nearest translations do to people who speak other languages? </p>



<p>Earlier this year, a team led by Joshua Conrad Jackson at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill published a <a href="https://science.sciencemag.org/content/366/6472/1517">paper in <em>Science</em></a> that looked for variations in the meaning of 24 emotional concepts across 2474 languages. The team examined the pattern of “colexification” in the different languages: that is, the way that single words are used to describe multiple concepts. For instance, in Persian, <em>ænduh</em> means both grief and regret, while in the Dargwa dialect, spoken in Dagestan in Russia, <em>dard</em> means grief and anxiety. So speakers of the two languages might have slightly different understandings of what “grief” is.</p>



<p>The team found important variations between language families. For example, in some languages, “anger” was related to “envy”, whereas in others it was linked more with “hate” or “proud”. In some Austronesian languages, “pity” and “love” were associated, whereas in others, they were not. (In general, though, there was agreement about which emotions are “positive” and which are “negative”.) The work suggests that there are indeed shades of culturally-influenced emotional experience. </p>



<p><strong>Sensory perceptions</strong></p>



<p>The octave system is not only intrinsic to Western music, it’s also mathematically-based: move up an octave, and a given note doubles in frequency. Perhaps, then, Western music has come to use this system because it relates to the way that sound waves physically stimulate the cochlea in our inner ear — in other words, there’s something biologically fundamental, and universal, about the way we perceive pitch. </p>



<p>The problem with this suggestion is that, until recently, researchers hadn’t tested the musical perceptions of people who had not been exposed to Western music. In 2019, that changed. In a <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S096098221931036X">paper in <em>Current Biology</em></a>, a team led by Nori Jacoby at the Max Planck Institute for Empirical Aesthetics revealed that a remote group of people living in the Bolivian rainforest don’t process pitch in the same way as Americans. Unlike those of us used to listening to Western music, these people don’t perceive similarities between two notes occurring an octave apart. </p>



<p>This work adds to other research, notably in <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/18335">vision</a> and <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2014/01/13/studies-of-se-asian-tribes-force-a-re-think-on-the-psychology-of-language-and-smell/">smell</a>, revealing that, while of course we humans all possess the same hardware, culture influences our sensory perceptions. </p>



<p><strong>Mate preferences</strong></p>



<p>Back in 1989, the American psychologist David Buss published <a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/behavioral-and-brain-sciences/article/sex-differences-in-human-mate-preferences-evolutionary-hypotheses-tested-in-37-cultures/0E112ACEB2E7BC877805E3AC11ABC889">an influential paper</a> concluding that there are some clear gender differences in mate preferences. Based on a study of data from more than 10,000 participants from 37 different cultures, he and his team suggested that women tend to be more interested in “good financial prospects” than men, and that men, more than women, consider “good looks” to be important in a mate. Cue a heated debate, and all kinds of follow-up studies. The big question was this: if these differences indeed exist, are they driven by biology, or by culture — and specifically by gender inequality? In cultures with markedly greater gender equality, might these differences disappear? </p>



<p>In 2020, against a backdrop of old data and conflicting methods and conclusions, a huge international team, led by Kathryn Walter at the University of California, Santa Barbara, published a <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0956797620904154?journalCode=pssa">large-scale replication study</a> on more than 14,000 participants across 45 countries. Across groups, men were more interested in physical attractiveness than women, who in turn preferred older mates with good financial prospects. In countries with greater gender equality, couples tended to be more closely matched in age, but beyond this, levels of gender equality did not have an impact. The researchers concluded: “Support for universal sex differences in preferences remains robust.”</p>



<p><strong>Human values </strong></p>



<p>Do we all fundamentally value the same things? And do these values vary at all with age — or between genders? </p>



<p>These are more than theoretically important questions. As the team behind a <a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2018.00849/full">recent paper in <em>Frontiers in Psychology</em></a> led by Paul Hanel (Cardiff University) note, immigration is triggering some conflicts over perceptions of value. For example, a 2016 poll reported that three quarters of people living in Ontario, Canada, felt that <a href="https://www.thestar.com/news/immigration/2016/07/04/ontario-facing-epidemic-of-islamophobia-survey-finds.html">Muslim immigrants have fundamentally different values to their own</a>. </p>



<p>However, other surveys have found that people around the world agree on values. In <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0022022101032003002">one study</a> by Shalom Schwartz and Anat Bardi, people from 50 different countries tended to agree that benevolence, universalism and self-direction are highly important; tradition and power were valued least. </p>



<p>So what can explain these discrepancies? Hanel and his colleagues <a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2018.00849/full">recently studied</a> people living in three different cultures: Brazil, India and the UK. They concluded that people in different nations can differ in the behaviours associated with certain values, while still holding similar ideas about the meaning and importance of those values. </p>



<p>In 2020, a <a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2020-16473-001">separate team led by Roosevelt Vilar</a> looked at age and gender differences in values among more than 20,000 people living across 20 countries with “substantial” cultural variability. They found slight differences between men and women through most life stages. In general, women were more focused on social and ‘central’ goals (helping others, for example) whereas men were more focused on personal goals (excitement and promotion). Older people, too, valued social and central goals more than younger people, who were more enamoured of personal goals. </p>



<p>However, the team reports, culture had virtually no impact on the results. This, they argue, “supports the lifespan developmental psychological idea that values reflect a universal pattern of human agency in facing challenges over the life span”.</p>



<p>Broadly, then, this study, at least, argues that we are all driven to have fundamentally the same values — and the same slightly diverging values, according to age and gender — no matter where we live in the world.</p>



<p>While all these studies help us to understand which aspects of the human experience are universal, they don’t actually fix the WEIRD problem, of course. What we really need are for researchers to include non-WEIRD participants in studies as <em>standard</em>. But while this should make results more generalisable, clearly there could also be situations in which there <em>are</em> meaningful differences in results between cultures — and these should be appreciated, too.</p>

<p>To record the activity from a  population of neurons, calcium imaging and extracellular recordings with small electrodes are the two most widely used methods that are still  able to disentangle the contributions from single units. Here, I would like to briefly mention two papers that try to connect these two approaches by comparing them more or less directly.</p>



<ol><li>Wei et al., <a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/840686v1">A comparison of neuronal population dynamics measured with calcium imaging and electrophysiology</a>, bioRxiv, 2019<br />[<strong>Update, 2020-09-15</strong>: The paper just came out in <a href="https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1008198">PLoS Comp Biology</a> just one day after the blog post!]<br /></li><li>Siegle, Ledochowitsch et al., <a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.10.244723v1">Reconciling functional differences in populations of neurons recorded with two-photon imaging and electrophysiology</a>, bioRxiv, 2020<br /></li></ol>



<p>Both papers compare calcium imaging datasets and extracellular ephys datasets, try to connect the results and point out the difficulties in reconciling the approaches.</p>



<p><strong>Wei et al. </strong>use datasets recorded in mouse anterio-lateral motor cortex (ALM). They first focus on approaches to reconstruct spike rates from calcium imaging data (deconvolution) and find several limitations of this approach. On the other hand, they find that a forward model that transforms spiking activity to calcium fluorescence data can reconcile most of these differences.</p>



<p>The authors also provide a user-friendly website which can be used to explore the transformations between ephys and imaging data (also including datasets with simultaneous ephys-imaging): <a href="http://im-phys.org">http://im-phys.org</a>. (Understanding the figures of the paper is however quite useful before exploring the website.)</p>

<p>A large part of the paper focuses on high-level analyses (principal component analysis, decoding of behavior and decision). I would take it as an educational tale of caution which highlights wrong conclusions that could be made based on standard analyses. For example, the slow and variable decay times of calcium imaging data can lead to a dispersion of peak activity that was absent in the ephys data. This dispersion can smear out clearly timed activations of neuronal population into something more similar to a sequence (see Figure 7, of which I have pasted an excerpt above).</p>



<p></p>



<p><strong>Siegle, Ledochowitsch et al.</strong> from the Allen Institute, rather than investigating the effects on higher-level population analyses, focus their attention on the effects seen in single neurons. When comparing a calcium imaging and an ephys dataset recorded in the same brain region (visual cortex V1) in mice that do the same standardized tasks, what differences can be seen in the firing properties of single neurons?</p>



<p>Due to the high standardization requirements at the Allen Institute, their datasets are probably uniquely qualified to be the basis for such a comparison. Interestingly, they find a couple of clear differences. For example, extracellular ephys data suggest typical firing rates of around 3 Hz (see Figure 2A), which is almost an order of magnitude higher than what has been recorded and estimated from calcium imaging data (see also <a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.31.272450v1">Figure 7 in our preprint</a>, which estimates spike rates of the same dataset).</p>



<p>The authors go to great lengths to use forward transformations (similar to Wei et al.) in order to reconcile differences seen for various response metrics (responsiveness, tuning preference, selectivity). However, their conclusion seemed to me quite a bit less optimistic compared to the Wei et al. paper. The authors go into more detail when discussing the potential reasons for the discrepancies, and focus on the recording methods themselves rather than on methods to transform between them. In particular their analysis of inter-spike-interval (ISI) violations in ephys recordings (which indicate that spikes from different neurons contaminate the recording of the neuron of interest) was, in my opinion, particularly interesting and convincing. I also really recommend to anybody the last paragraph of their discussion, from which I only want to cite their note of caution about extracellular ephys recordings:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>From this study, we have learned that extracellular electrophysiology overestimates the fraction of neurons that elevate their activity in response to visual stimuli, in a manner that is consistent with the effects of selection bias and contamination. – Siegle, Ledochowitsch et al.</p></blockquote>



<p>One of the reasons why I am writing about these two studies is that I have been working at the interface of calcium imaging and ephys myself, addressing the question, <a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.31.272450v1">How much information about spike rates can we get out of calcium imaging data?</a> Wei et al. and Siegle, Ledochowitsch et al. take a slightly broader perspective. And, in some way, they show how hard it is to reconcile two (methodological) perspectives on the same phenomenon. (I noticed this in my <a href="https://www.fmi.ch/research-groups/groupleader.html?group=119">PhD lab</a> as well, when it came to reconciling results from EM reconstructions of neuronal anatomy and calcium measurements of the same neurons.) Since almost any method in systems neuroscience is technically challenging, we often have in a single lab only a single perspective of a phenomenon, and I think it’s important to always be aware that the conclusions drawn from this perspective might be strongly biased.</p>



<p>In general, calcium imaging and extracellular ephys are extremely valuable tools to observe the living brain, and we better do anything to understand the properties and limitations of these tools. These studies sometimes might feel a bit like negative results and therefore not very attractive to those who want to advance neuroscience, and I therefore understand why not many are willing to undertake these projects. So I am glad to be able to highlight these two publications here.</p>

<p><em>By </em><a href="http://emilyoliviareynolds.com/">Emily Reynolds</a></p>



<p>When Usain Bolt or Serena Williams step out for their latest race or match, the world waits with bated breath. As some of the best athletes in the world, their unbelievable winning streaks have been met by almost universal acclaim — and plenty of people hoping that streak isn’t broken.</p>



<p>But <a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2020-59201-001">according to</a> Jesse Walker from Ohio State University and Thomas Gilovich from Cornell University, that investment and goodwill just isn’t the same when it comes to teams: we’re far less impressed by consecutive wins by groups of people than those by individuals. They call this phenomenon the “Streaking Star Effect” in their new paper in the <em>Journal of Personality and Social Psychology</em>.  </p>


<p><span id="more-40296"></span></p>


<p>In the first study, 207 participants read about the history and rules of Calcio Fiorentino, an obscure amateur Italian sport combining aspects of football, rugby and martial arts. Participants in the “team” condition were told the Milan team were the best in the world, winning six championships in a row; those in the “individual” condition read about Robert Moretti, the best player in the world, on the same streak. They then rated how much they would be rooting for either Milan or Moretti to win the championship and how much they would want the streak to come to an end.</p>



<p>Participants wanted to see Roberto Moretti continue his winning streak significantly more than they wanted the Milan team to do the same. Given that participants were American, they likely were not familiar with either the game or Moretti, suggesting that the results couldn’t be explained by a desire to see a beloved figure succeed. </p>



<p>The same results held in a second study using the similarly obscure example of a British quizzing competition. A third, in which the pool of competitors was exactly the same size for individuals and teams, showed that the Streaking Star Effect couldn’t be explained by the fact individual participants were likely to have beaten more competitors than teams would have.</p>



<p>The fourth study looked more closely at the underlying causes of the Streaking Star Effect. A total of 205 participants read about the National Association of Police Organizations, which gives awards each year to both individual police officers and departments. In the individual condition, participants read about an award given to the best homicide detective in the USA, and were told that Edwin Sorenson had won the award four years in a row. Participants in the group condition read about an award for the best homicide department in the country, learning that either the Kansas City or Los Angeles Police Department had, again, won four years in a row.</p>



<p>As well as answering the questions from the first three studies, participants also indicated how much they would feel awe, amazement and wonder if either Sorenson’s or the police department’s streak were to continue. To distinguish awe from other positive emotions, participants also stated how happy, amused and compassionate they would feel.</p>



<p>Again, participants were significantly more keen to see the individual (Detective Sorenson) extend his winning streak than the team (the police department). Furthermore, participants felt more wonder at the prospect of Detective Sorenson’s continued success and more positive emotion overall, suggesting that feelings of awe can lead to a greater desire to see an individual winning streak continue.</p>



<p>In a later study, participants were asked to explain why they felt either an individual or a team was on a winning streak. Success was more often chalked up to disposition or personal characteristics (rather than circumstances) for individuals than it was for teams. Greater dispositional attributions were also linked to increased feelings of awe. In other words, credit was given to an individual and their talents more than their situation, creating far more emotional attachment and investment than for team achievements, which tended to be attributed to circumstances.</p>



<p>A final study confirmed that the Streaking Star Effect holds even outside of sports: when a company’s success was attributed to an individual CEO, participants felt that the company deserved a greater market share than when it had been guided by a group of executives. This makes sense: companies like Microsoft and Apple have famously benefited from charismatic founders and CEOs, while those without a focus on an individual leader often hold less emotional resonance for the general public.</p>



<p>This final study hints at wider repercussions too, and in a follow-up survey the team found participants far less tolerant of wealth inequality when those at the top were described in group rather than individual terms: when <em>individuals</em> were perceived to be at the top, participants were more likely to believe they deserved it. Stretching beyond sport, the Streaking Star Effect may even, as Walker and Gilovich put it, change the way we think about “the rich and poor, the powerful and powerless”.</p>

<img alt="" class="attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image" height="110" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2020/09/Tinnitus-140x110.jpg" style="display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;" width="140" /><p>Let’s be honest, when most of us attend or take part in noisy recreational activities (e.g., nightclubs, concerts, playing musical instruments, indoor/outdoor sporting activities, motorsports) the last thing we reach for are hearing protection devices (e.g., earplugs and earmuffs). This is despite the fact that these activities can often range in loudness levels over 100 dBA, with the potential to <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nceh/hearing_loss/what_noises_cause_hearing_loss.html">cause hearing symptoms (e.g., dullness in hearing/tinnitus) after 15 minutes</a> of continuous exposure. This is one of the reasons why the <a href="https://www.who.int/mediacentre/news/releases/2015/ear-care/en/">World Health Organization</a> estimates that over a billion teenagers and young adults are at risk of hearing symptoms due to recreational noise exposure.</p>
<p>The use of hearing protection devices is recognized as a method of reducing noise exposure. However, the amount of people using these devices within recreational contexts just ‘some of the time’ can be <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3722160/">as low as ~5%</a>, and even fewer people ‘always’ using them. Some people do tend to walk away from loud sources of noise, or go and take a break on a night out (e.g., regeneration break), and this is another method of protecting your hearing.</p>
<p>In order to improve hearing protection behaviors (e.g., earplugs, earmuffs, regeneration breaks) through interventions it would be beneficial to know how effective previous interventions have been in recreational contexts, and what were the active ingredients (<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK327617/">behavior change techniques</a> (BCTs)) of these interventions trying to bring about the change.  Knowing what BCTs have been applied previously, or perhaps not, can help future designers of hearing protection interventions to potentially improve uptake. We conducted a systematic review of any intervention studies that measured a deliberate attempt to increase hearing protection behaviors during noisy recreational activities.</p>
<p>So what did we find? We found eight studies measuring behavior post-intervention, of which only three were experimental post-test designs (two randomized controlled studies and one quasi). The most common behavior reported was the use of earplugs, seen in all eight studies, with five having a small to medium effect (d ≥ 0·3 ≤ 0·5) at measuring an increase, or difference in earplug use – including all three experimental studies. The overall increase or difference in earplugs being used ‘some of the time’ across all eight studies ranged from 3% -14.6%, but with very few ‘always’ using earplugs people are at risk of acquiring hearing symptoms.</p>
<p>In terms of BCTs, across all studies we found a total of 17 different techniques had been deployed out of a possible 93 available from within the ‘<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23512568/">behavior change technique taxonomy version 1</a>’, with the majority serving an intervention category of ‘education’ (e.g., information about health consequences). With so few BCTs coded it leaves a large scope to test previously unused techniques. However, all three experimental studies restructured the environment by providing free earplugs (e.g., adding objects to the environment), and each measured a small to medium effect for at least one recreational context – perhaps indicating that this should be at least considered for future interventions.</p>
<p>Overall the results tell us there are very few hearing protection interventions addressing recreational noise exposure, a global hearing health concern, and those that have tackled the issue have had mixed success. Further intervention studies should be conducted that employ randomized controlled designs, with use of systematic approaches to intervention development (e.g. <a href="https://implementationscience.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1748-5908-6-42">the behavior change wheel</a>), as this will help target specific behavior change techniques in an effort to increase hearing protection behaviors and raise effect sizes.</p>
<p>Will you be reaching for your earplugs the next time?</p>

The caprine participants had lived at the sanctuary for at least two years and were fully habituated to humans. Heart rate and respiration were recorded as indicators of arousal, so this dimension of emotion could be considered separately from valence (positive/negative). For conditions #1-3, the goats were tested in pairs (adjacent pens) to avoid the stress of social isolation. They were habituated to the general set-up, to the Frustration and Isolation scenarios, and to the heart rate monitor before the actual experimental sessions, which were run on separate days.

In the animal literature, a similar head-orienting response is a standard experimental procedure.

<p><strong>When it comes to text messages, a single full stop can be loaded with meaning. </strong>A simple “OK”, for example, might be fine by itself — but suddenly takes on a passive-aggressive tone when it becomes “OK.” <a href="https://www.npr.org/2020/09/05/909969004/before-texting-your-kid-make-sure-to-double-check-your-punctuation">Danny Hensel explores why this is the case</a> at <em>NPR.</em></p>

<p><strong>Some people who have been infected with Covid-19 continue to have physical symptoms for months — and this can take its toll on their mental health. </strong>Recent research has suggested that between one third and one half of Covid “long-haulers” may experience mental health problems like anxiety, depression or fatigue, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/07/health/coronavirus-mental-health-long-hauler.html">writes Emma Goldberg</a> at the <em>New York Times</em>.</p>

<p><strong>After we lose someone, our feelings of grief don’t follow the fixed timeline of discrete stages often depicted in popular culture. </strong>Instead, the course of grief can be messy and manifest differently for different people, <a href="https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/akz9ee/we-want-grief-to-follow-a-timeline-it-doesnt">writes Shayla Love</a> at <em>Vice</em>. </p>

<p><strong>The use of polygraph machines — also known as lie detectors — is “creeping into UK policing”</strong>, according to a <a href="https://www.wired.co.uk/article/uk-police-polygraph-lie-detector-terrorism">story from Amit Katwala at <em>WIRED</em></a>.  In a recent study, few UK police forces would confirm or deny that they used polygraphs, and some appeared to be using them in “covert” or “investigatory” contexts. Yet a large body of research has shown that polygraphs are not a reliable way of telling whether someone is lying.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://liorpachter.wordpress.com/2020/09/10/sexual-harassment-case-number-1052/">Sexual harassment case number 1,052</a></h4>

<p>Despite much ado about the #metoo movement in recent years, the crisis of sexual harassment in academia persists without an end in sight. The <a href="https://academic-sexual-misconduct-database.org/index.php/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">academic sexual misconduct database</a> now lists 1,051 cases, each of them a tragedy of trauma, unspeakable violations of victims, and dreams destroyed. I’ve written previously about two cases listed in the database (<a href="https://liorpachter.wordpress.com/2018/11/28/yuval-peres/">Yuval Peres</a> and <a href="https://liorpachter.wordpress.com/2018/01/17/terry-speed-a-male-feminist/">Terry Speed</a>). Now, I feel compelled to write about yet another sexual harassment case.</p>



<p><a href="https://uwm.edu/engineering/people/dumitrescu-ph-d-adrian/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">Adrian Dumitrescu</a> is a professor in the Department of Mathematical Sciences at the University of Wisconsin, Milwaukee. I have known of his work for many years, as we have a shared interest in extremal combinatorics, having both worked on <a href="https://www.ams.org/journals/bull/2000-37-04/S0273-0979-00-00877-6/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">the Erdös-Szekeres “Happy Ending Problem”</a>. Last week a Facebook post was brought to my attention, in which a graduate student describes a horrible case of sexual harassment by Prof. Dumitrescu that occurred during a conference in Boston in 2016.</p>



<p>This student filed a Title IX complaint with the University of Wisconsin, and I have a copy of the report. The Office of Equity and Diversity (EDS) that investigated the case found that “Based on the totality of the circumstances, the information obtained pursuant to this investigation, and for all the reasons set forth above, EDS concludes that there is sufficient evidence to support a finding, by preponderance of the evidence, of sexual harassment against the Respondent [Prof. Dumitrescu].” Furthermore, the report states that “based on the seriousness of the Respondent’s conduct, EDS believes that disciplinary action is warranted in this matter, and recommends that the Provost refer this case for imposition of discipline”. As I write this post, Prof. Dumitrescu is still listed as a professor at the University of Wisconsin, Milwaukee.</p>



<p>Notably, after being sexually harassed by the Respondent, and before filing a report with Title IX, the student consulted her Ph.D. advisor. The report describes his response as follows: “[he] told her that the Respondent had a ‘high reputation’ in the field and it was better to ‘avoid trouble’ and not to report her concerns.” And yet she had the courage to report the case, despite the attempt to silence her, and having being threatened by the Respondent, as he coerced her to sleep with him, that if she did not acquiesce to his demands he would not conduct research with her and he might prevent senior scholars at her university from working with her.</p>



<p>The report details how the sexual harassment impacted the complainant’s research progress and mental well-being. Yet again, a talented young scientist finds herself with debilitating trauma, a career in jeopardy, and powerless in the face of an establishment that excuses harassers.</p>



<p>The details of this case are of course different than every other sexual harassment case. Each is tragic in its own way. And yet elements of what happened here are to be found in all sexual harassment cases. Power imbalance. Coercion. Threats. Silencing of the victim. Inaction. Banal injustice. This will be case number 1,052 in the <a href="https://academic-sexual-misconduct-database.org/index.php/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">academic sexual misconduct database</a>.</p>



<p>We must do better.</p>

<p><em>By</em> <a href="https://emmayoung.net/">Emma Young</a></p>



<p>The COVID-19 pandemic has transformed all our lives. For those of us fortunate enough to avoid unemployment, our work lives have still changed drastically. So how long should it take employees to recover psychologically, and settle into a “new normal”? According to a <a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/fulltext/2020-61814-001.html">new paper,</a> published in the <em>Journal of Applied Psychology</em>, this process actually began very early on. This is among the first work to show that psychological recovery can start <em>during</em> a stressful experience.</p>


<p><span id="more-40268"></span></p>


<p>The pandemic has threatened workers’ wellbeing in all kinds of ways. As Eric Anicich at the University of Southern California and his colleagues point out, it has increased personal economic uncertainty (through furloughs and lay-offs and the prospect of more redundancies), constrained our physical movements and forced many of us to suddenly start working from home — as well as of course threatening our health, even our lives. All of these factors have challenged our autonomy, which is important for wellbeing because it entails feeling in control of our own actions, and seeing an alignment between our behaviour and our personal values and goals. (This particular aspect of autonomy is often referred to as “authenticity”).</p>



<p>The researchers set out therefore to explore how the pandemic might affect both feelings of powerlessnesss and authenticity. They focused on workers — specifically on full-time employees of 41 community colleges on the West Coast of the US.</p>



<p>One of the remarkable aspects of the study was its timing. The 117 participants completed background surveys during March 9 – 15, 2020. At this point, they were assessed for the personality trait of neuroticism and also gave demographic data. The main data collection then ran over two consecutive work weeks, starting March 16. It began, then, on the Monday after COVID-19 was declared a global pandemic by the WHO and a “national emergency” by the US government.</p>



<p>Three times a day — in the morning, early afternoon and late afternoon — during those ten days, the participants used five-point scales to indicate their level of agreement with two statements: “Right now, I feel powerless” and “I feel like I am able to be truly myself right now”. They also rated their “current stress level regarding the COVID-19 situation”. (These surveys were purposefully very brief, in a bid to maintain participation over the fortnight.)</p>



<p>The analysis revealed two trends: over this period, the employees reported feeling <em>decreasingly</em> powerless and <em>more</em> authentic. However, their high stress levels did not change.</p>



<p>The team were able to compare this group’s responses with very similar types of data that they had collected from a different group in September 2019. They found that (unsurprisingly) the COVID-era group started out feeling more powerless and less authentic than the pre-COVID group. But for this 2019 group, there were no clear trends in changes over time for either measure. As the researchers write: “these results provide additional evidence that the temporal trajectories of powerlessness and authenticity observed in our focal dataset are unique to the time period associated with the COVID-19 outbreak.”</p>



<p>Previous studies exploring psychological recovery from a major stressor have tended to begin after the stressor has ended, and noted changes over months or even years. In contrast, this study shows that recovery (in relation to these two measures, at least) can begin almost immediately after the start of an ongoing stressful event. “Interestingly, these effects emerged while neither the objective situation nor the subjective stress reactions to it were improving,” the researchers note.</p>



<p>Also interestingly, those participants who’d scored relatively highly for neuroticism (which entails an increased tendency to feel anxious, depressed and vulnerable) at the start of the study showed the steepest decreases in powerlessness and increases in authenticity. Why? Perhaps, the team suggests, because during difficult times, people who tend to worry a good deal anyway suddenly have just cause — there’s a greater match between the state of the world and how they feel — and this is psychologically beneficial for them.</p>



<p>But how did these employees, as a group, manage to start this aspect of recovery immediately, when their stress levels were still high?</p>



<p>We are strongly motivated to tackle threats to our autonomy, the team notes. The study couldn’t reveal what changes, if any, the participants made in their lives. But they might have benefitted from a number of strategies, such as active detachment (spending time with pets, perhaps), relaxation, fostering a sense of mastery (if only through learning how to use Zoom…), even suddenly being able to wear whatever they wanted while working.</p>



<p>Still, as the participants’ stress levels were still high, their recovery was only partial. More research is clearly needed to explore what remedial strategies can help to rebuild autonomy — and to explore what happens to this marker of wellbeing (as well as others) into the longer term. But the study does  at least reveal that (for people with jobs, and of course that’s worth stressing) our psychological immune system is able to rally against at least some aspects of an attack like COVID-19.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/635333678/0/oupblogpsychology/">The role of masculinity in reforming police departments</a></h4>

<p>For decades there have been murders of unarmed black people by the police, which in recent years has been exposed and protested by the #BlackLivesMatter movement. This summer, unprecedented numbers of protesters have voiced their outrage in response to the murders of George Floyd and Breonna Taylor, the very recent and utterly senseless shooting of Jacob Black, and countless other acts of violence. Many mayors have announced plans for reform. The protests have rightly focused on the roles of race and racism in police brutality, but more attention needs to be given to the role of gender, particularly as municipalities seek to repair the police force to avoid this unnecessary use of force and violence.</p><p>Using data from the Riverside County Sheriff’s Department in California, a <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0093854807313995?journalCode=cjbb&amp;">2008 study</a> found that male officers were three times more likely to commit unwarranted shootings than their female counterparts. Additionally, white male police officers were 57% more likely than Latino male officers to commit such a shooting. These statistics refer to the group that constitutes the majority of police officers in America—white men.</p><p>But even more importantly, the culture of police departments tends to be macho and hyper-masculine—<a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1300/J012v16n03_01">a culture which glorifies violence</a>. This has always been the case but it has intensified as police departments across the county have moved from the community policing approach to militarization, aided by federal grants.</p><p>While among the general public masculinity is seen as synonymous with being male, psychologists view it differently—as a set of social norms, in this case norms for how boys and men should think, act, and feel. Masculinity is problematic in that that most boys are made to feel that they must conform to gender norms—that is, act in ways consistent with their gender. Masculinity is presented as obligatory for most boys, and most <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://doi.org/10.1037/a0037262">boys feel they have no other choice but to conform to masculine norms</a>. This is not true for girls, who are given much more flexibility and latitude when it comes to their performance of gender than are boys. Furthermore, one of the principal functions of masculinity is to establish several hierarchies: of men over women, of white men over men of color, and of straight cisgender men over gay, bisexual, and transgender men.</p><p>To move away from the macho and hyper-masculine culture, police forces must diversify—not only in race but in gender—their ranks and leadership. The presence of many more women, openly LGBTQ people, and non-white officers on the police force, and deploying training designed to heighten awareness of masculinity and its relationship to violence, will be crucial in this regard.</p><p>Although most boys are expected to conform to masculinity norms, most adult men come to accept who they are, even if they do not meet the masculinity ideals. Masculinity is, after all, a tough standard. That is, they come to terms with the messages from their childhoods and recognize that their unique personalities do not fit or need to fit the ideal in all ways, perhaps saying to themselves “I am not the most masculine guy in the world but that’s OK.” A smaller group feels deeply ashamed of themselves for violating the masculine norms. Experimental research using the “precarious manhood” paradigm has shown that <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0963721411402669">such men, when their masculinity is threatened, tend to respond with aggression</a>.</p><p>The research that has been conducted over the past 40+ years shows that one or another scale that measures masculinity is correlated with one or another harmful outcome, many related to violence. Since most adult men do not conform to masculine norms, what accounts for these harmful outcomes? One source is the group of men who respond to threats to their masculinity aggressively. In addition, masculinity’s destructive outcomes also arise from those men who “check all the boxes,” and conform to masculine norms to the greatest extent. These are the men whom we might label as hyper-masculine. Both groups of men tend to populate police departments as currently constituted. Their influence must be diluted by diversifying police forces.</p><p><em>Featured image by Free-Photos from <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://pixabay.com/photos/squad-car-police-lights-city-urban-1209719/">Pixabay</a></em></p><p>The post <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://blog.oup.com/2020/09/the-role-of-masculinity-in-reforming-police-departments/">The role of masculinity in reforming police departments</a> appeared first on <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://blog.oup.com">OUPblog</a>.</p><img align="left" border="0" height="1" hspace="0" src="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/i/635333678/0/oupblogpsychology" style="border: 0; float: left; margin: 0; padding: 0; width: 1px!important; height: 1px!important;" width="1" /><div style="clear: both; padding-top: 0.2em;"><a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/2/635333678/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/fbshare20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/28/635333678/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/fblike20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/30/635333678/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/googleplus20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/16/635333678/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/linkedin20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/29/635333678/oupblogpsychology,"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/pinterest20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/1/635333678/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/reddit20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/24/635333678/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/twitter20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/19/635333678/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/email20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/20/635333678/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/rss20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a><h3 style="clear: left; padding-top: 10px;">Related Stories</h3><ul><li><a href="https://blog.oup.com/2020/09/do-you-feel-sorry-for-first-year-university-students/" rel="nofollow">Do you feel sorry for first year university students?</a></li><li><a href="https://blog.oup.com/2020/09/smaller-prisons-are-smarter/" rel="nofollow">Smaller prisons are smarter</a></li><li><a href="https://blog.oup.com/2020/09/campus-activists-show-us-how-to-end-gender-based-violence/" rel="nofollow">Campus activists show us how to end gender-based violence</a></li></ul> </div>

<img alt="" class="attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image" height="110" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2020/09/little-boy-1635065_640-140x110.jpg" style="display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;" width="140" /><p><strong>Adverse childhood experiences related to negative health outcomes</strong></p>
<p>As researchers, we often try to pinpoint the causes of negative outcomes in adults. What factors contribute to obesity? What about heart disease? Why are some people more prone to depression and anxiety while others are not? Surely it is not random chance why some individuals are more prone to these outcomes while others are not.</p>
<p>While each outcome may be linked to something specific (i.e., a person’s chance of getting lung cancer increases exponentially if they smoke), there is one factor that has been linked to a variety of negative outcomes like lung cancer, heart disease, anxiety, depression, obesity, unemployment, divorce, and even poor athletic performance.</p>
<p>What’s the factor that is linked to all of these outcomes?  The term is called “adverse childhood experiences,” or ACEs for short.</p>
<p>In the 1980s, a researcher named Vincent Felitti ran an obesity clinic in California. Around 50% of the participants dropped out, while the other 50% successfully completed the program. He decided to interview many of the dropouts, and found a common theme: Nearly all of them experienced some form of sexual, physical, or mental abuse as children. Interviews from the group that completed the program revealed only a very small percentage reported the same abuse.</p>
<p>Felitti eventually collaborated with a colleague, Robert Anda, in a large study of 17,000 individuals. In that study, Felitti and Anda identified eight domains of ACEs: physical abuse, sexual abuse, emotional abuse, parental separation/divorce, interpersonal violence, incarcerated family member, family mental illness, and family substance use.</p>
<p>Regardless of the event, Felitti and Anda found that the more numerical experiences an individual had, the more likely they were to have negative outcomes as adults.  Essentially, every person has an ACE score, ranging from 0 (no adverse events before the age of 18) to 8 (adverse events in all 8 categories).</p>
<p>All this said, public health researchers and practitioners in all areas of prevention/intervention (e.g., mental health professionals, substance abuse counselors, etc.), have been trying to develop programs which either 1. Limit the number of ACEs people have, or 2. Help people deal with their ACEs as adults in order to help lessen their effect.</p>
<p><strong>Our study</strong></p>
<p>This is where our recent article titled, “The Frequencies and Disparities of Adverse Childhood Experiences in the U.S.” published in <a href="https://bmcpublichealth.biomedcentral.com/"><em>BMC Public Health</em></a> helps advance the field of ACEs.  In the article, we collected the most comprehensive ACEs dataset to date: 211,376 adults across 34 states.</p>
<blockquote><p>Over half (58%) of all participants experienced at least one ACE.</p></blockquote>
<p>The study helps shed light on precisely who is at-risk for higher ACEs. We report several noteworthy findings.</p>
<ol>
<li>Over half (58%) of all participants experienced at least one ACE.</li>
<li>Almost one-quarter (22%) experienced three or more ACEs.</li>
<li>Women were more likely to experience ACEs compared to men</li>
<li>Black, Hispanic, and Multi-racial individuals were more likely to have more ACEs compared to White individuals.</li>
<li>People who identify as a sexual minority (lesbian, gay, or bisexual) were more likely to have more ACEs compared to heterosexual individuals.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Future implications</strong></p>
<p>So what does this all mean? There are several implications to the study. First, the more we know about ACEs, the greater the chances we have in both preventing ACEs and lessening their effect.  Next, ACEs are not equally distributed amongst the general population.  Some groups have a higher likelihood of experiencing ACEs, making them uniquely more prone to negative outcomes due to ACEs. Having insight into which groups are particularly vulnerable to ACEs is helpful for professionals that work in fields dealing with the repercussions of ACEs (like mental health counselors). Knowledge about which groups have a higher likelihood of ACE exposure will aid in tailoring programmatic responses to these groups.</p>

<img alt="" class="attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image" height="110" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2020/09/BNEP-blog-140x110.png" style="display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;" width="140" /><p>It is known that chronic kidney disease (CKD) and end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) patients are at an extremely high risk for cardiovascular disease, stroke, and peripheral vascular disease.  In addition, most patients have additional risk factors including diabetes, hypertension, and obesity. Should more be done to help improve their risk and overall health? What if clinicians could prescribe an exercise regimen? Are there additional hemodialysis specific benefits to exercising?</p>
<p>In a recent <em>BMC Nephrology </em>publication, <a href="https://bmcnephrol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12882-020-02021-2">Bogataj et al.</a> performed a randomised controlled trial to examines the effects of intradialytic cycling and functional training on dialysis adequacy and other biochemical parameters. Participants were divided into a functional training intervention group (with intradialytic cycling) and an intradialytic cycling only control group. For the first eight weeks, participants in the intervention group performed guided functional exercise training three times a week before each dialysis session and additional intradialytic cycling exercise. This included a warm-up, full range of motion exercises with additional weights, and a cool-down with stretching.  For the second eight weeks the same group took the functional training home to do on non-dialysis days. The authors concluded that in both groups the dialysis adequacy improved and was sustained through the entire study; however, additional benefits were found in the intervention group, with promising improvements in the participants’ total cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol.</p>
<p>The improvement in dialysis adequacy with exercise during hemodialysis is not new. In 2004, <a href="https://www.dustri.com/article_response_page.html?artId=480&amp;doi=10.5414/CNP61261&amp;L=0">Parsons et al.</a> also conducted an eight week study looking at intradialytic exercise and found that there was enhanced dialysate urea removal. The physiology of how improved dialysis adequacy occurs is thought to be through an increase in muscle blood flow and increase in oxygen extraction, which increases capillary surface area and increases the exchange of substances from the tissue to the vascular compartment. This increased diffusion into the vascular compartment allows for substances like urea to be removed by dialysis.  Therefore, improved dialysis adequacy. <a href="https://academic.oup.com/ndt/article/14/12/2927/1818764">Kong et al.</a> demonstrated a 14% increase in dialysis adequacy from 60 minutes of intradialytic exercise.  This increase is equivalent to increasing a dialysis session by 20 minutes. It would be interesting to find out how many of my patients would prefer cycling during dialysis for an hour rather than increasing their dialysis time. Would it be more cost effective to have everyone perform intradialytic exercise rather than increasing dialyzer size or time?</p>
<blockquote><p>Would it be more cost effective to have everyone perform intradialytic exercise rather than increasing dialyzer size or time?</p></blockquote>
<p>With the Bogataj et al article, there was also improvement in total cholesterol and LDL for the intervention group. There is clear evidence for preventing major cardiovascular events and mortality with lowering LDL for those with normal or slightly abnormal kidney function. For patients with CKD and ESKD, it can still be controversial. Our guidelines do not advocate starting every ESKD patient on a statin but what about lowering cholesterol with exercise? This type of intervention for cholesterol improvement still needs to be studied over a longer period with examining cardiovascular outcomes.</p>
<p>If budget was not an issue, I might consider purchasing customized cycling equipment for my in-center hemodialysis patients and hiring a kinesiologist or personal trainer to perform rounds in the dialysis unit like our dietician and social worker. With time, I imagine we will have larger, longer duration studies that will further support the idea that a novel exercise prescription strategy has specific health benefits for patients with CKD.</p>

<p><em>By </em><a href="http://emilyoliviareynolds.com/">Emily Reynolds</a></p>



<p>Not all confessions are created equal. In a criminal justice setting, some admissions of guilt are both sincere and corroborated — but others are not, having been coerced, given by vulnerable or underage defendants, or unreliably reported secondhand. Yet mock jury trials have shown that lay people often tend to take a confession at face value, handing down a guilty verdict without considering other potential evidence.</p>



<p>It’s with this in mind that Fabiana Alceste from City University of New York and colleagues question just how well people really understand the existing body of evidence on reliable, admissible confessions in a <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/epdf/10.1002/acp.3735">new paper in <em>Applied Cognitive Psychology</em></a>. The answer to that question could have ramifications not only for those on juries but also for the people they’re deciding whether to convict.</p>


<p><span id="more-40254"></span></p>


<p>To examine lay beliefs, the researchers presented 151 participants with thirty statements related to interviews, interrogations and confessions, some true and some false. These statements had previously been presented to a panel of confession experts, and related to one of four areas: general principles of psychology (e.g. “compared to most adults, adolescents exhibit immaturity of judgment in their decision-making”), truth and deception detection (e.g. “trained police can distinguish between truths and lies at high levels of accuracy”), police interrogation tactics (e.g. “threats of physical violence during interrogation can lead an innocent person to confess to a crime”), and confessions (e.g. “confessions can be verified as true by the details that they contain about the crime”).</p>



<p>After viewing each statement, participants indicated how reliable they thought the evidence behind it was, responding with either: “the reverse is probably true”, “the evidence does not support it”, “the evidence is inconclusive”, “the evidence tends to favour it”, “the evidence is generally reliable”, “the evidence is very reliable”, or “I don’t know”. Participants also indicated whether or not they <em>personally</em> agreed or disagreed with each assertion, as well as stating whether or not they believed a jury would benefit from hearing testimony from an expert in a trial involving a disputed confession.</p>



<p>A majority of participants correctly endorsed all of the statements relating to psychological principles — the effects of reward and punishment on behaviour, adolescent decision-making and sleep deprivation, for example. Experts and laypeople were generally in agreement on these statements, though experts endorsed them at significantly higher rates.</p>



<p>When it came to deception detection, however, a majority of participants endorsed <em>unsupported</em> statements — that trained experts can accurately judge truth or lies from facial microexpressions, for example, or through non-verbal behavioural cues. The panel of experts, on the other hand, correctly rejected these propositions.</p>



<p>There were also some large discrepancies when it came to interrogation tactics. While 84% of participants correctly identified that torture can get innocent people to confess, only 56% believed that false claims of evidence implicating the suspect in the crime can do the same — versus 94% of experts who asserted that it can. Worryingly, significantly more participants believed Miranda rights (your “right to remain silent”) adequately protected against false confessions — 49% to the experts’ 25%.</p>



<p>When the team looked at beliefs about <em>reliability</em> of research, however, the gap between participants and experts widened further. Both laypeople and experts personally disagreed with the statement “innocent people never provide false confessions voluntarily”, for instance — but while nearly every expert indicated the research did not support the statement, many laypeople believed the evidence was still inconclusive or even supported the statement.. The same disparity was  found for a number of other statements about confessions.</p>



<p>Almost all participants — 94% — believed that juries would benefit from hearing expert testimony. Yet they rarely answered “I don’t know” to the questions, suggesting that they were not particularly clear on their <em>own</em> lack of knowledge. Future research could explore this  gap further by looking at participants’ confidence in each answer — working out whether people don’t know what they don’t know, in other words.</p>



<p>Despite the clear value of expert knowledge on confessions, many courtrooms do not accept it as admissible testimony, instead relying on juries using common sense. But that “common sense”, as this study highlights, does not always match up to the body of evidence surrounding confessions.</p>



<p>The team suggests that confession experts <em>should</em> be permitted to give testimony to juries, who may not possess reliable information about admissible evidence and instead harbour incorrect beliefs. Understanding interview, interrogation and confession isn’t just an intellectual matter — the serious ramifications that emerge from a lack of knowledge can literally be a matter of life and death.</p>

<p><em>By </em><a href="http://emilyoliviareynolds.com/">Emily Reynolds</a></p>



<p>Finishing off a big task can be memorable, whether you sincerely feel you’ve achieved something or are just relieved to have got it out of the way. Everyday tasks, however, are much more mundane: taking your daily medication or typing in a password are unlikely to be particularly noteworthy events.</p>



<p>You may also have found a gap between your <em>intention</em> to do a particular mundane task and actually enacting it — meaning you either can’t remember whether you actually did it, or misremember having done it entirely. It’s this phenomenon that Dolores Albarracin and colleagues from the University of Illinois explore for the first time in a new <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0146167220929203">paper</a> in <em>Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin</em>. </p>


<p><span id="more-40236"></span></p>


<p>In the first part of the study, participants played the part of a manager reviewing applications to model for a clothing brochure. In some cases, participants were asked whether they wanted to hire the applicant immediately; in others, they were asked to state whether they <em>intended</em> to hire the applicant later; and in a control condition, were asked to state whether the gender listed in a form about the applicant matched the gender of their photo.</p>



<p>After a brief break, participants saw each applicant again and indicated whether or not they had made a final hire decision in the previous part of the study. As anticipated, participants were more likely to mistakenly believe they had already hired (or rejected) applicants in the “intention” condition than those in the control condition — suggesting that we sometimes mistake having intended to do something with having actually done it.</p>



<p>Next, using the same process, the team showed that  this effect was more pronounced when there are physical similarities between behaviour and intention — in short, when doing something and intending to do something feel or look the same.</p>



<p>Participants in the high similarity condition pressed a key on their keyboard for both the “behaviour” (the definite hiring decisions) and “intention”  (the intended hiring decisions), while those in the low similarity condition enacted <em>behaviour</em> with a keystroke but <em>intention</em> mentally, simply thinking about their intention rather than logging it.</p>



<p>Those in the high similarity condition were more likely to confuse intention with behaviour than those in the low similarity condition, indicating that a similarity in expression may increase the odds of falsely remembering having completed a task (opening an email you intend to respond to later, for example, rather than leaving it unread or adding it to a to do list, may make you more likely to misremember having sent your response).</p>



<p>In the next study, participants judged some candidates by attractiveness and others by competence. As before, participants used these criteria to either register their intention to do something or actually enact behaviour.  Again, intentions were misreported as enactments far more than the other way around; similarly, misreports were far more likely within the same hiring criteria than in a different one (i.e. an intention to hire based on attractiveness was more likely to be misremembered as having actually hired the candidate based on attractiveness than as having actually hired them based on competence). As in the keystroke study, this suggests that similarities in the cognitive processes involved in behaviour and intentions are a key part of mistaken beliefs.</p>



<p>Mistaking intentions for behaviours, even for mundane actions, is not insignificant. Small acts  can be important in many areas of our life: the actual act of taking medication, for instance, may be routine and uninteresting, but its impact is often far from it. Results from this study suggest, however, that it’s something we may frequently misremember doing because the physical actions are so samey.</p>



<p>Results from a final study may indicate a fairly useful — and pretty simple — solution to the problem of misremembering behaviours: active monitoring. Participants who physically wrote down their final hiring decision or their intention to hire were less likely to misremember what they’d done. Writing things down or checking them off a list might not be failsafe — and it might not be very exciting itself — but it could be a good way to ensure that things are getting done.</p>

<p>It’s one of the best-known and also controversial experiments in psychology: in 1963, Stanley Milgram reported that, when instructed, many people are surprisingly willing to deliver apparently dangerous electrical shocks to others. For some researchers, this — along with follow-up studies by the team — reveals how acting “under orders” can undermine our moral compass.</p>



<p>Milgram’s interpretation of his findings, and the methods, too, <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2015/10/13/social-psychology-textbooks-ignore-all-modern-criticisms-of-milgrams-obedience-experiments/">have been criticised</a>. However, the results have largely been replicated in experiments run in <a href="https://thepsychologist.bps.org.uk/volume-21/edition-9/news-and-media">the US</a>, <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2017/05/05/new-milgram-replication-finds-90-per-cent-of-polish-participants-willing-to-deliver-highest-shock/">Poland</a>, and elsewhere. And in 2016, a brain-scanning study revealed that when we perform an act under coercion vs freely, our brain processes it more like a passive action rather than a voluntary one.</p>



<p>Now a new study, from a group that specialises in the neuroscience of empathy, takes this further: Emilie Caspar at the Social Brain Lab at the Netherlands Institute for Neuroscience and colleagues report in <em>NeuroImage</em> that when we follow orders to hurt someone, there is <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1053811920307370?via=ihub">reduced activity in brain networks involved in our ability to feel another’s pain</a>. What’s more, this leads us to perceive pain that we inflict as being less severe. This process could, then, help to explain the dark side of obedience.</p>


<p><span id="more-40226"></span></p>


<p>Most of the 40 participants recruited for the new work were women, and their average age was about 25. None knew each other before arriving at the lab, where they were studied in gender-matched pairs. Within each pair, one person was randomly chosen to first be the “agent”, and the other the “victim” (they would later switch roles). The agent was taken to an MRI scanner in one room, while the victim was seated in another, electrodes attached to their hand. While in the scanner, the agent could see a live video of the victim’s hand, so they could observe the (genuine) impact of their actions.</p>



<p>The task itself was split into four blocks of 30 trials each. During two of the blocks, the agent was told “you can decide” whether or not to press a button to inflict a mildly painful electrical shock to the victim. During the other two blocks, half the time they were given the instruction “Shock”, and half the time “No Shock”. Each shock the agent gave was “rewarded” with €0.05.</p>



<p>The team found that, on average, people were less likely to administer a shock when it was up to them. (Still, the number of shocks was not negligible: an average of 23 out of the 60 “you decide” trials vs 30 of the 60 instructed trials. Statistically, there’s a significant difference between the two figures, but there clearly isn’t a chasm.)</p>



<p>Caspar and her colleagues used the brain imaging data to look closely at three distinct patterns of activity: the “vicarious pain signature” (associated with feeling other people’s pain); the “neurologic pain signature” (associated with experiencing pain directly) and the “interpersonal guilt signature” (observable when we feel guilt over a harmful impact on another person). The team found that when someone was obeying orders to administer a shock, rather than choosing to do so, both the vicarious pain signature and the interpersonal guilt signature were less intense.</p>



<p>Tallying with the brain imaging results, the participants reported feeling less bad, and less sorry, about inflicting pain when acting under orders — and they reported that these shocks looked less severe on the video. As the researchers note, this was despite the fact that the participants had been told the shocks would always be of the same intensity. “Obeying orders has such a strong influence on the perception of pain felt by others that it even impacts perceptual reports of observed shock intensity,” the researchers write.</p>



<p>All in all, the results imply that when we’re acting under orders to hurt someone, we don’t find it as personally unpleasant as when we hurt someone freely. Part of the reason we normally don’t hurt other people is because we’d feel at least some of their pain ourselves, but when obeying orders this vicarious response is reduced — so we’re more likely to harm them.</p>



<p>The team argues that a sense of responsibility and/or agency (feeling that we are the author of our own actions) is key: when these are reduced, so too is our empathy for pain that we inflict, with potentially dire results. The results “highlight how obeying an order relaxes our aversion against harming others, despite still being the author of the action that led to the pain,” they write.</p>



<p>But why might this happen? Is there something more fundamental going on?</p>



<p>Remember that in this study — as in other similar studies — the participants were acting under the clear orders of an authority figure with an electric shock machine at their disposal. As for all living things, our prime directives are to survive and thrive. Imagine in the real world being ordered by someone in authority to harm another person. You might recognise (even unconsciously) that your choice is either to obey, or disobey and risk being hurt yourself — either physically, or in terms of your career. An evolved ability to dial down your empathy for someone else’s pain in such a situation could be of benefit to you.</p>

<p>A new study in <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/1948550620937937?journalCode=sppa"><em>Social Psychological and Personality Science</em></a><em><u> </u></em>backs this up, finding that such biases can tangibly affect Black women’s chances with potential employers. Christy Zhou Koval at Michigan State University and Ashleigh Shelby Rosette at Duke University found that Black women with natural hairstyles were seen as less competent and less professional than White female applicants or Black applicants with straightened hair — and that they were less likely to get job interviews, too.</p>


<p><span id="more-40194"></span></p>


<p>In the first study, 480 participants imagined themselves as a recruiter, tasked with evaluating job applicants based on their Facebook profile. The applicants themselves had a wide range of different hairstyles, but fell into one of four groups: White women with curly or straight hair, and Black women with natural or straightened hair. Participants rated each applicant on professionalism and competence, and indicated how likely they would be to select the applicant for an interview.</p>



<p>As expected, Black women with natural hairstyles were rated as less professional and less competent than Black women with straightened hair and White women with both curly and straight hair (though curly-haired White women were ranked as less professional than their straight-haired counterparts). Black women with natural hair were also the group least likely to be recommended for interview.</p>



<p>A second study replicated this process — except this time, participants saw multiple pictures of the same women with different hairstyles. The effect held: Black women were seen as less professional, less competent and less likely to be invited to interview when they were depicted with natural hair.</p>



<p>A further study looked at the role of industry in perception of natural hair. This time, participants were told they were recruiting either for the <em>consulting</em> industry (traditionally more conservative) or the <em>advertising industry </em>(more laidback). In the consulting condition, Black women with natural hair were again considered less professional and less competent and again received fewer recommendations for interview than Black women with straightened hair. In advertising, however, there was no difference in either professionalism or interview recommendations. A further study replicated these findings.</p>



<p>The results highlight the need for an intersectional approach to understanding workplace discrimination. It’s obviously true that women often experience <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2019/11/19/companies-are-judged-more-harshly-for-their-ethical-failures-if-the-ceo-is-a-woman/">extensive</a> <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2020/06/02/women-are-more-likely-than-men-to-be-told-white-lies-in-performance-reviews/">biases</a> at work because of their gender — but these biases can be compounded or experienced in completely different ways by women of colour. The discrimination outlined in this study is certainly not the only kind experienced by Black women — and, as the team notes, other women of colour experience stigma around their appearance too. Headscarves, to use just one example, may also affect hiring practices.     </p>



<p>Future research could look at more natural scenarios — although some employers do look at social media profiles while hiring, examining biases during in-person interviews could provide further insights.</p>



<p>The findings from the second part of the study suggest that differing norms between sectors may play a key part in perpetuating inequality. It follows that addressing such systemic racism is an important part in addressing these sorts of biases. Public policies, as <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/10/us/army-ban-on-dreadlocks-black-servicewomen.html">seen</a> in some parts of the US, may also help to protect Black women from employment discrimination: in four US states, for example, it’s now <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/mar/06/virginia-hair-discrimination-ban">illegal to discriminate</a> based on someone’s hairstyle.</p>



<p>It’s also important to note that although this study was conducted in an American context, the problem exists across the world — as Irish writer Emma Dabiri points out in her <a href="https://www.change.org/p/uk-government-protect-afro-textured-hair-amend-the-uk-equality-act-to-include-hair">petition</a> to amend the UK Equality Act to include hair discrimination. Research looking at exactly how these biases operate in other countries is key to understanding and tackling such practices.</p>

<p><strong>What can we do to stay connected in the middle of a pandemic? </strong>We’ve all played our part in fighting COVID-19, and for many of us that has meant staying away from our friends and families. In this episode, our presenter <a href="https://www.ginnysmithscience.com/">Ginny Smith</a> explores how this unprecedented period of separation has reinforced the importance of connection. Ginny looks at how video chats compare to in-person interaction, and how psychology could help improve virtual communication in the future. She also examines the importance of touch for reducing stress — and asks whether interactions with our furry friends could make up for a lack of human contact.</p>


<p><span id="more-40170"></span></p>


<p>Our guests, in order of appearance, are Dr Shane Rogers, lecturer in psychology at Edith Cowan University, Australia, and Professor Patricia Pendry, from Washington State University.</p>

                <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/~r/plos/Blog/~3/5xUm1rHSfOw/">Theme of 2020 Open Access Week to be Open with Purpose: Taking Action to Build Structural Equity and Inclusion</a></h4>

<p>This post was written by Nick Shockey and first appeared on <a href="http://openaccessweek.org/profiles/blogs/2020-theme-announcement-english">openaccessweek.org</a> and has since been reposted on <a href="https://sparcopen.org/">sparcopen.org.</a> Nick is the Director of Programs and Engagement for SPARC.</p>



<p>The 2020 Open Access Week Advisory Committee is pleased to announce that the theme for this year’s International Open Access Week, to be held October 19-25, will be “Open with Purpose: Taking Action to Build Structural Equity and Inclusion.”</p>



<p>Openness can be a powerful tool for building more equitable systems of sharing knowledge. Rebuilding research and scholarship to be open by default presents a unique opportunity to construct a foundation that is fundamentally more equitable. Yet today, structural racism, discrimination, and exclusion are present and persistent in places where openness is a core value. As a global community, it is important to understand that the systems and spaces of the present are often built upon legacies of historic injustice and that addressing these inequities is a necessity.  </p>



<p>We need to examine who these spaces and systems are designed for, who is missing, who is excluded by the business models we use, and whose interests are prioritized. As we work together to rebuild these structures, we need to commit to moving from conversations to concrete commitments and to hold one another accountable for making real progress.</p>



<p>Building on our discussions in 2018 (“Designing Equitable Foundations for Open Knowledge”) and 2019 (“Open for Whom? Equity in Open Knowledge”), 2020 marks the third consecutive year the theme for International Open Access Week will focus on the urgent need for action on equity and inclusion, underscoring the urgency of continuing to center this work.</p>



<p>International Open Access Week is a time for the wider community to coordinate in taking action to make openness the default for research and to ensure that equity is at the center of this work. This year’s Open Access Week will be held from October 19th through the 25th; however, organizers are encouraged to host discussions and take action around this year’s theme whenever is most suitable during the year and to adapt the theme and activities to their local context. This is especially true for this year with the varying levels of disruption due to COVID-19.</p>



<p>Diversity, equity, and inclusion must be consistently prioritized year-round and integrated into the fabric of the open community, from how our infrastructure is built to how we organize community discussions to the governance structures we use. International Open Access Week is an important opportunity to catalyze new conversations, create connections across and between communities that can facilitate this co-design, and advance progress to build more equitable foundations for opening knowledge—discussions and actions that need to be continued, year in and year out. </p>

<p><strong>Psychologists interested in dreams spend a lot of time analysing dream diaries — but what if they could have a computer do all that laborious work for them? </strong>That’s the promise of a new algorithm that uses text analysis to look for patterns in people’s dream reports, <a href="https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2020/08/new-algorithm-can-find-hidden-patterns-your-dreams">writes Charlotte Hartley</a> at <em>Science</em>. The tool could help researchers understand how dreams differ in different populations, or how the content of dreams relates to wellbeing.<span id="more-40144"></span></p>

<p><strong>Many people who live with eating disorders have experienced an exacerbation of their symptoms during the coronavirus pandemic,</strong> <a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/covid-19-era-isolation-is-making-dangerous-eating-disorders-worse/?utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+sciam%2Fmind-and-brain+%28Topic%3A+Mind+%26+Brain%29">reports Michelle Konstantinovsky</a> at <em>Scientific American</em>. There could be many reasons for this, including reduced social support and face-to-face therapy, a lack of structure, and increased feelings of anxiety.</p>

<p><strong>Another study has found that there has been a <em>reduction</em> in anxiety among year nine students in southwest England during lockdown. </strong>While stuck at home, kids may have been protected from aspects of school which negatively affect their wellbeing, such as pressures associated with schoolwork and the need to navigate social relationships, <a href="https://theconversation.com/school-closures-had-positive-effects-on-some-teenagers-mental-health-our-new-research-suggests-144884">writes researcher Emily Widnall</a> at <em>The Conversation</em>.

<p><strong>Finally, acronyms are becoming increasingly common in scientific papers, creating barriers for science communication, </strong><a href="https://www.popsci.com/story/science/science-journals-acronyms-communication/">reports Hannah Seo</a> at <em>Popular Science</em>. Researchers analysed 25 million papers published in the past 70 years, finding that abstracts and titles contained more than 1 million unique acronyms, most of which were only used a handful of times. More recent papers also contained a greater proportion of acronyms. There is clearly a place for acronyms, Seo writes, but overuse can make science less accessible to the public and even to scientists from different fields.</p>

<p><em>By</em> <a href="https://twitter.com/mattbwarren">Matthew Warren</a></p>



<p>One of the classic findings in memory research is that we’re better at remembering information when we’re in a similar context to that in which we learned it. This was perhaps most famously demonstrated in <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/epdf/10.1111/j.2044-8295.1975.tb01468.x?saml_referrer">a 1975 study</a>, which found that people who learned a list of words while scuba diving had better memory for the words when again underwater, compared to when on land (similarly, those who had learned the list on land were better at remembering it on land).</p>



<p>But it’s not just the external environment that matters: our internal states can also provide memory cues. For instance, people who were intoxicated when learning information were <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/5774177/">better at recalling that information when drunk</a> than when sober, and there’s also evidence that our recall is better <a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/record/1994-32292-001">when our mood matches how we felt at learning</a>.</p>



<p>Now a <a href="https://srcd.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/cdev.13444">new study published in <em>Child Development</em></a> has found that the same is true even of babies in their first year of life. The findings have implications for understanding infant memory — and could even help to explain why we can’t remember anything from our early years.</p>


<p><span id="more-40135"></span></p>


<p>To look at state-dependent memory in babies, Sabine Seehagen and colleagues from Ruhr University Bochum in Germany recruited 96 nine-month-old infants and their caregivers. In the learning phase of the experiment, the babies watched a researcher perform a series of actions with an animal puppet: removing the puppet’s mitten, shaking it three times, then replacing it. </p>



<p>After a short break, there was a test phase where the infant had the opportunity to play with the puppet themselves. They had 90 seconds to do any of the three actions — i.e. remove the mitten, shake it, and replace it — though they weren’t prompted to do so in any way.</p>



<p>Crucially, immediately before the learning and testing phases, the babies had a 5 minute play session designed to put them in a specific state of mind. Sometimes caregivers were instructed to play as calmly as possible with their infant and they were given quiet toys like a book and soft toy. Other times they were instructed to play as animatedly as possible, and given more active toys like a ball and swing.</p>



<p>For one group of infants, the play sessions were the same before both learning and testing phases (i.e. calm both times, or animated both times). In another group, the play sessions were different (i.e. calm at learning and animated at testing, or vice-versa). And a third group only did the testing phase, without the learning part (this allowed the researchers to look at how often the babies performed the actions just by chance).  </p>



<p>The team found that infants who had the same kind of play before both learning and testing made an average of 1.47 actions during testing. This was significantly more than those whose play sessions were different, who only made an average of 0.59 actions. In fact, the babies in the latter condition didn’t seem to remember the actions at all: they performed no better than the babies who hadn’t even done the learning part of the study.</p>



<p>The findings suggest that internal states do provide important cues for babies when they’re retrieving memories. And that seems to make sense: while older children and adults have a wealth of knowledge and experiences which allow them to use a variety of cues to trigger memories, young infants haven’t yet formed those connections. Relying on internal states to aid recall is therefore “highly adaptive”, the authors say.</p>



<p>This reliance on internal cues might also contribute to “infantile amnesia”, the fact that we’re unable to recall anything from our earliest years. As we grow our internal state changes considerably, and is never again going to match that of our first years of life — so, like the babies in the “different state” condition, we’re not able to access our memories.  </p>



<p>It’s worth pointing out that the research didn’t directly measure babies’ internal states, as the team acknowledges. During the animated play sessions, the babies did show significantly more movement and active behaviour than during the calm sessions. But further work will be required to see whether memory recall is truly dependent on infants’ emotions — it could be that the matching types of activity were somehow providing cues to the babies even without influencing their mood.</p>

                <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/~r/plos/Blog/~3/-NFg9bVWp4w/">Author Interview: Arunima Malik on Global Effects of the Coronavirus Pandemic</a></h4>

<p>Arunima Malik and an international team of researchers recently assessed how the Coronavirus pandemic has caused worldwide consumption losses amounting to more than US$3.8 trillion while simultaneously spawning the largest recorded drop in greenhouse gas emissions. Their <em>PLOS ONE </em>paper, “<a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0235654"><em>Global socio-economic losses and environmental gains from the Coronavirus pandemic</em>,</a>” highlights the inherent dilemma of the global socio-economic system and the need for increased global cooperation and solidarity. Read on to see their thoughts on the need to move beyond discipline boundaries, the effects of their research on policy and more. </p>



<p><em><strong>The list of authors on this article spans the globe, with researchers affiliated with Australia, Japan, Ecuador, China, Indonesia, United States, and the United Kingdom. Can you speak on how this team was formed?</strong></em></p>



<p>AM: The assessment presented in our published study was undertaken in the Global Industrial Ecological Virtual Laboratory — a cloud computing environment that brings together researchers from multiple disciplines and universities to foster new and innovative research.</p>



<p>We formed the multi-regional multi-disciplinary team to allow us to capture insights and data related to COVID-19 for not just English, but also for a range of languages. We followed a three-tier approach to enable us to best capture global events related to the pandemic. We note in the manuscript: “In addition to English, and in alphabetical order, Arabic, Chinese, Farsi, French, German, Hindi, Indonesian, Italian, Japanese, Portuguese and Spanish were used in our search, thus covering languages spoken by over 5 billion people.”</p>



<p><em><strong>What drives you in your field of research, and why do you believe your research is important?</strong></em></p>



<p>AM: I am passionate about understanding impacts embodied in complex supply chains. It’s important to be able to understand how systems are interconnected, and how effects in one system ripple through other systems. Sustainability applies to us all, and I enjoy being able to contribute to this evolving field of research. Regarding the current pandemic, these ripple effects have been further emphasized on a global scale. </p>



<p><em><strong>How crucial are structures that support interdisciplinary review to the publication and dissemination of your research? </strong></em></p>



<p>AM: My research is interdisciplinary as it brings together concepts and methodologies from a range of disciplines. It is therefore important to have structures that support interdisciplinary review and dissemination of results. There is a need to move beyond disciplinary boundaries to facilitate and promote interdisciplinary research for understanding complex sustainability-related issues.</p>



<p><em><strong>What impact is your research having in your scientific community, in the media, and more widely? </strong></em></p>



<p>AM: Research in supply chain analysis is definitely gaining relevance, and we are now starting to see the use of input-output tables by organisations for sustainability assessments. Input output analysis has been used in the reports published by the United Nations Sustainable Development Solutions Network and the Stockholm Environment Institute — such as the report on the <a href="https://www.sei.org/publications/spillovers-sdg-implementation-soy-argentina/">Argentina-EU soy supply chain</a> regarding impacts on Sustainable Development Goals.</p>



<h4>Comments from the Editor</h4>



<p><em>Dr.</em> <em><a href="https://www.iass-potsdam.de/en/people/bing-xue">Bing Xue</a>, PLOS ONE Academic Editor from the Institute for Advanced Sustainability Studies in Germany, speaks on the importance of Arunima’s research and supply chain analyses. </em></p>



<p>BX: The spread of COVID-19 has impacted the global economy, triggering a great debate in the economic circles on the impact of the epidemic. As a result of the lockdown and other measures taken by various countries to deal with the pandemic, the supply chain at the enterprise level was disrupted, which led to the shutdown of global value chain trade, specifically in terms of consumption loss, income loss and employment loss. At the same time, due to the ripple effect of supply chain disruption, some polluting companies have reduced output, reducing GHG and SO<sub>2</sub> emissions, which has a positive impact on the environment. </p>



<p>Looking at the world as a cohesive whole, global MRIO-based supply-chain analyses helps to clearly understand the different impacts on countries in different positions of global value chain. The coronavirus pandemic has had a significant impact on some important conditions for the rise and rapid progress of economic globalization, stimulating the restructuring of global value chains. </p>



<p>What is more important is the orderly development of economic globalization after the pandemic. Based on the perspective of the global industrial chain, how to cope with the impact of the outbreak and spread of the pandemic on the supply chain is an issue that should be concerned by the scientific community.</p>



<p><em>I would like to thank Arunima and Bing for their research and for taking the time to provide their thoughtful comments. </em></p>

<p><em>By</em> <a href="https://twitter.com/mattbwarren">Matthew Warren</a></p>



<p>We’ve all had the experience of losing our temper when being treated unfairly by someone else. And while anger isn’t the most pleasant emotion, it can be a useful social tool to signal to another person that we’re not happy with how they’re acting towards us.</p>



<p>But what about when we suffer because of bad luck, rather someone else’s actions? In that case it would seem to make little sense to get mad. And yet, a <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0191886920304967">new study</a> in <em>Personality and Individual Differences </em>finds that a certain group of people are more likely to show anger in such situations: those who feel like they are particularly entitled in the first place.</p>


<p><span id="more-40124"></span></p>


<p>Psychological entitlement is essentially a belief that you deserve more than others. People who score highly in entitlement tend to think that others should be accommodating of their own needs and schedules, for instance, and are more likely to see themselves as being mistreated. When their high expectations aren’t met, they can experience reduced wellbeing and feelings of anger.</p>



<p>In a series of studies, Emily Zitek from Cornell University and Alexander Jordan from Harvard Medical School looked at whether these emotional effects of entitlement extend to situations solely involving bad luck. First, the pair asked 162 participants to fill in the Psychological Entitlement Scale, which asks respondents to rate their agreement with statements like “I honestly feel I’m just more deserving than others”.  Participants were also asked how good they would expect their luck to normally be when rolling dice.</p>



<p>Participants were then told that they would be randomly allocated by dice roll to either a fun task (rating comic strips) or a boring task (counting the letters in a paragraph). In reality, all participants were told they had had “bad luck” and been assigned to the boring task. They then rated how unjust they felt this was, and indicated how angry they were.</p>



<p>The team found that those higher in entitlement had a stronger feeling of injustice and greater levels of anger. More entitled participants also generally expected to experience better luck when rolling dice, suggesting this is another instance where entitled people have (unrealistically) high expectations.</p>



<p>In a second study, participants were asked to recall either a time when something bad had happened to them solely because of bad luck, or when someone had treated them unfairly. They then indicated how fair and just they felt the event was, and rated their feelings of anger. </p>



<p>People high in entitlement again showed greater anger than those low in entitlement when recalling an instance of bad luck. But when remembering an instance of unfair treatment, those high and low in entitlement showed similar levels of anger. That is, entitlement again seemed to be an important factor in determining anger after bad luck, but not when there was a specific individual to blame.</p>



<p>Finally, the researchers looked at how entitlement related to feelings of anger and pity when <em>someone else</em> experiences bad luck. Participants read a scenario in which their flight had been cancelled and the airline was randomly selecting a customer to hop onto another plane with a spare seat. In one scenario they were told that they had been unlucky and someone else had been picked; in another they were the lucky one.</p>



<p>When the participants read that they had had bad luck, higher entitlement was once again related to greater feelings of anger. Unsurprisingly, participants didn’t feel much anger when they were assigned the seat and the other person was unlucky. But they did experience pity towards that person — and interestingly, those with a greater sense of entitlement reported <em>less</em> pity.</p>



<p>Overall, then, the studies suggest that entitled people expect to have good luck, and get angry after experiencing bad luck — even though by definition there is no-one to direct that anger towards. (The authors do acknowledge it’s possible that people implicitly blame God or some higher power for their bad luck).</p>



<p>So what are the consequences of experiencing anger in those situations? The researchers suggest that feelings of anger and injustice could reinforce people’s sense of entitlement, though they add that there could be benefits too — if anger motivates someone to try and improve their performance in the future, for instance (though that may be difficult in cases where a bad result is purely down to luck).</p>



<p>Similarly, it remains to be seen how the results translate to the real world. In most cases an instance of “bad luck” doesn’t occur in isolation, but often in a social setting — so it would seem prudent to examine whether this kind of anger is taken out on others.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/634481516/0/oupblogpsychology/">Communicating and connecting with your teenager leaving for college</a></h4>

<p>In a previous <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://blog.oup.com/2020/08/how-parents-can-support-their-teenagers-starting-college-in-uncertain-times/">post</a> I described topics of conversations to have with a teenager leaving home for college. Equally, if not more important, is the process of communication.</p><p><strong>Understand the positive power of a strong family foundation</strong>. The power of a supportive family is almost unlimited.  Let me be clear that a family does not need to consist of a heterosexual mother and father, 2.5 children, and a golden retriever. A family is a group of people who are committed to one another for the long run, based on their love. If students understand that no matter what, they can depend on their family, any transition will be easier. Research supports this view: the same study of anxiety and depression during the pandemic revealed that family support was associated with fewer psychological disorders.</p><p><strong>Develop your family communication skills.</strong>  The first step in the communication process may sound simple at first: listen. Too many parents, especially when anxious, tend to lecture, perhaps the worst possible strategy for communicating with teens.  You can express your emotions first, not to meet your needs but to normalize a conversation about feelings.  A parent can open a conversation with a statement like,  “I know this is a hard time for most of us, and I know I’m a bit worried. How are you feeling?” In this way, you acknowledge that it is OK to be frightened or anxious. Listening takes time, accepting some silence, and it isn’t always easy. Your teen may brush you off at first—that’s okay, there will be other opportunities. Keep the lines of communication.</p><p><strong>Accept that communication may change</strong>. Flexibility will be key for a positive transition to college.  You may hear from your child less often: embrace that as growth. He is learning to depend on other people for support, expanding his social world.  He may primarily use texting or short phone calls when he’s walking.  You also have the right to let your child know that you need to hear from them now and then.  But don’t invade their space by reading their Instagram or Twitter. You can respect their privacy and if you want to learn more about campus life, subscribe to the student newspaper or check the college website. Other students, especially during these uncertain times, may want to stay connected and text or call often. If you already text or talk on the phone with your teen frequently, the contact may stay the same or increase. They are letting you know what they need. There is no absolute right or wrong rate of communication, especially during the first few months of the college transition.</p><p><strong>Take care of yourself</strong>. It is axiomatic in mental health that if a parent feels psychologically healthy, so will a child.  To support your student, they need to feel that you are OK, that they can leave knowing that the situation at home is solid. This doesn’t mean that your family will be free of stress, but that you will be able to cope or find solutions to problems that arise. This is called “self-efficacy.” You may have lost your job or suffered financial setbacks during this time, or worse, lost a loved one to COVID-19. And you are probably going to miss your child. You may be under additional pressure if you are a single parent, a member of a minority group, or if you work on the front lines of healthcare or a service industry. It also appears that mothers who work outside the home may also be doing the lion’s share of the housework and educational needs of their children. Try to take time for yourself by establishing <strong>daily</strong> relaxing rituals, like short meditations or breathing exercises or listening to music. Reach out to your partner, a close friend or relative for support. Just as your child needs care, so do you.</p><p>This is a time for all of us to focus on values, on what matters most. For most of us, family and education are fundamental. Parents can help their college-age children move through this unexpectedly difficult transition, and we all need to take care of one another.</p><p><em>Featured Image Credit:<a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://www.freepik.com/free-photo/lovely-teenage-with-grandmother-home_5432734.htm"> Image</a> by jcomp via Freepik</em></p><p>The post <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://blog.oup.com/2020/08/communicating-and-connecting-with-your-teenager-leaving-for-college/">Communicating and connecting with your teenager leaving for college</a> appeared first on <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://blog.oup.com">OUPblog</a>.</p><img align="left" border="0" height="1" hspace="0" src="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/i/634481516/0/oupblogpsychology" style="border: 0; float: left; margin: 0; padding: 0; width: 1px!important; height: 1px!important;" width="1" /><div style="clear: both; padding-top: 0.2em;"><a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/2/634481516/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/fbshare20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/28/634481516/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/fblike20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/30/634481516/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/googleplus20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/16/634481516/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/linkedin20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/29/634481516/oupblogpsychology,"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/pinterest20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/1/634481516/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/reddit20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/24/634481516/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/twitter20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/19/634481516/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/email20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/20/634481516/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/rss20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a><h3 style="clear: left; padding-top: 10px;">Related Stories</h3><ul><li><a href="https://blog.oup.com/2020/08/how-parents-can-support-their-teenagers-starting-college-in-uncertain-times/" rel="nofollow">How parents can support their teenagers starting college in uncertain times</a></li><li><a href="https://blog.oup.com/2020/09/do-you-feel-sorry-for-first-year-university-students/" rel="nofollow">Do you feel sorry for first year university students?</a></li><li><a href="https://blog.oup.com/2020/09/searching-for-magic-bullet-antibodies-to-combat-covid-19/" rel="nofollow">Searching for “magic bullet” antibodies to combat COVID-19</a></li></ul> </div>

<p><strong>PhD in Computational &amp; Cognitive Neuroscience</strong></p>
<p>An exciting full-time funded PhD opportunity has arisen at the University of Hertfordshire associated to a collaborative project with King’s College London and Brunel University London funded by the US Air Force.</p>
<p>The project aims to build an explorative and predictive model of the brain that is sensitive to the transitions between sustained attention and mind-wandering states using an already collected simultaneously acquired EEG/fMRI dataset. Towards this goal, novel methods for characterizing, sequencing, and predicting neural dynamics at two complementary spatio-temporal resolution levels will be developed: level 1) electroencephalography (EEG) microstates, which are short quasi-stable topographies of brain electrical activity as measured at the scalp; and level 2) functional connectivity maps derived from the functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) data.</p>
<p>We are seeking to appoint a graduate in Computer Science, Bioengineering, Physics, Mathematics, Neuroscience, or related fields, with an interest in cognitive neuroscience and neuroimaging, who has proven programming skills (e.g., Python, Matlab,  C++).  Knowledge of signal processing, time-series analysis, and machine learning would be an advantage. Previous experience of EEG and/or fMRI data analysis is highly desirable.</p>

<p>Dogs are much more than just pets. With an innately acute sense of smell up to 100,000 times greater than ours, dogs can be trained to detect not only drugs and explosives but also the scent of individuals with cancer, malaria and other diseases. Now, as this pilot <a href="https://bmcinfectdis.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12879-020-05281-3/?utm_source=bmc_blogs&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=null&amp;utm_campaign=blog_2020_bmcseriesblog">randomized controlled trial</a> in <em><a href="https://bmcinfectdis.biomedcentral.com/?utm_source=bmc_blogs&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=null&amp;utm_campaign=blog_2020_bmcseriesblog">BMC Infectious Diseases</a></em> shows, they can also be trained to detect those with coronavirus.<img alt="" class="size-medium wp-image-12087 alignright" height="200" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2020/08/neil-fedorowycz-hHCDldR1ZcQ-unsplash-300x200.jpg" width="300" /></p>
<p>In their study, Prof. Holger Volk and colleagues at the University of Veterinary Medicine Hannover presented dogs with samples from PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2-positive or –negative nasopharyngeal swabs taken from symptomatic COVID-19 patients or healthy controls. Samples were presented in a randomized, automated and blinded manner and dogs were rewarded with a treat or ball when a positive sample was successfully sniffed out. After only seven days of training, the cohort of eight dogs achieved an average detection rate of 94%, with 157 correctly identified positive samples, 792 rejected negative samples and only 33 false positives and 30 false negatives.</p>
<p>This remarkable ability likely relies on the different patterns of volatile compounds given off by infected cells compared to uninfected cells in the body. This preliminary study helps to pave the way for larger trials on the use of dogs to detect SARS-CoV-2 infection, which may be particularly useful in countries with limited access to lab-based diagnostics.</p>

<p>With our lives seemingly getting busier and busier, our health can suffer. In their recently published study in <a href="https://bmcpublichealth.biomedcentral.com/?utm_source=bmc_blogs&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=null&amp;utm_campaign=blog_2020_bmcseriesblog"><em>BMC Public Health</em></a>, Mensah and Adjei look at how gender and the level of welfare provision by the state impact the association between work-life balance and self-reported health. The results of the study indicate that the impact of a poor work-life balance on health is generally more pronounced in women, apart from in Conservative states (such as Germany and Switzerland) where the effect is greater in men. States with welfare regimes that are considered Conservative or Liberal (i.e. the UK and Ireland) show the strongest association between work-life conflict and poor health, which the authors suggest may be a result of differences in employment regulation, weaker trade unions and less generous provision of state welfare than other countries such as the Nordic states. The findings of this study show that governments and policymakers must carefully consider how working practices and state welfare policies differentially affect women and men’s health.

<p>Investigators for the Emergency Laparotomy and Frailty (ELF) Study set up a Twitter handle (@ELFStudy) to promote site registration in preparation for the trial and to promote patient recruitment once the trial commenced. The authors tracked engagement with their tweets over time and found that an increased number of tweets over time correlated with increased patient recruitment, with each individual tweet associated with an additional 1.66 patients recruited. The authors propose that their eye-catching branding (in this case Christmas themed thanks to the study’s acronym!) enabled them to engage with their target audience and ‘market’ the trial, allowing them to reach their intended recruitment target in half the time predicted.</p>

<blockquote><p>The most promising interventions involved persuasion, enablement, feedback on behavior and restructuring of the social environment</p></blockquote>
<p>Antibiotic resistance is emerging as a major public health problem and is particularly worrying in long-term care facilities for older adults, where residents are vulnerable to serious infections and poor outcomes. In <a href="https://bmcgeriatr.biomedcentral.com/?utm_source=bmc_blogs&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=null&amp;utm_campaign=blog_2020_bmcseriesblog"><em>BMC Geriatrics</em></a>, Clayton <em>et al. </em>systematically review antimicrobial stewardship interventions, which aim to reduce overuse of antibiotics, and assess the types of behavior change techniques associated with positive outcomes. Of over 10,000 records initially screened, the authors assess 72 articles for eligibility with only 20 of those suitable for in-depth analysis. In the majority of those 20 studies, the behavior targeted was antibiotic prescribing by healthcare professionals. The most promising interventions involved persuasion, enablement, feedback on behavior and restructuring of the social environment, for example assigning a staff member as an antimicrobial stewardship champion. The least promising interventions, on the other hand, used problem solving techniques or provided feedback on outcomes of behavior, such as local antimicrobial resistance patterns. The results of this secondary analysis may help to guide the design or refinement of interventions to tackle antibiotic resistance in this community setting.</p>

<p>High salt levels can cause osmotic, nutritional and metabolic stress in plants, leading to poor crop yield and poor crop quality. Some plants, such as sugar beet – an important source of sucrose – have evolved tolerance mechanisms to cope with salt stress. In this article in <a href="https://bmcplantbiol.biomedcentral.com/?utm_source=bmc_blogs&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=null&amp;utm_campaign=blog_2020_bmcseriesblog"><em>BMC Plant Biology</em></a>, Li <em>et al.</em> use quantitative proteomics to study salt stress coping mechanisms in different parts of the sugar beet plant.</p>
<p>Both leaves and roots were sampled from plants grown in high salt vs. control conditions, with global changes in protein levels profiled in these samples by mass spectrometry. Using this approach, 70 and 76 differentially abundant proteins were identified in leaves and roots respectively, only three of which were found in both sample types.</p>
<p>Oxidation-reduction was found to be the most enriched biological process in the salt-regulated proteome in both leaves and roots, highlighting a potential role for redox homeostasis in stress tolerance. However, the precise molecular and metabolic pathways up- and down-regulated by salt stress were largely different between leaves and roots, suggesting that the two plant organs exploit different coping mechanisms. An understanding of these mechanisms may prove useful in future efforts to promote stress tolerance in commercially important crops like sugar beet.</p>

<p>Befriending, whereby volunteers provide support and companionship for individuals living with mental or physical illnesses, can help to reduce symptoms, reduce social isolation and improve quality of life. Befriending programmes may be particularly beneficial for individuals with psychosis, who commonly experience social isolation. However, such programmes can be difficult to implement and outcomes can be mixed. This qualitative study, published in <a href="https://bmcpsychiatry.biomedcentral.com/?utm_source=bmc_blogs&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=null&amp;utm_campaign=blog_2020_bmcseriesblog"><em>BMC Psychiatry</em></a>, looks at the experiences of both befrienders and patients who took part in a befriending programme for individuals with psychosis.</p>
<blockquote><p>befriending allowed them to develop a genuine relationship over time and provided an opportunity to ‘bridge the gap’ between those living with mental illness and wider society</p></blockquote>
<p>The authors highlight several key themes in their data from interviews with participants. Both volunteers and patients reported that befriending allowed them to develop a genuine relationship over time and provided an opportunity to ‘bridge the gap’ between those living with mental illness and wider society, challenging befrienders’ false preconceptions about psychosis. However, some volunteers also reported that the commitment was greater than anticipated and both befrienders and patients said that a flexible approach was required to meet the individual needs of those taking part. Studies such as this one help to recognize and maximize the benefits of befriending whilst also acknowledging its challenges.</p>

<p>Jeffrey Arnett describes <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://oxford.universitypressscholarship.com/view/10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199929382.001.0001/acprof-9780199929382">emerging adulthood</a> as a distinct stage of development from the late teens through the twenties; a life stage in which explorations and instability are the norm. As they focus on their self-development, emerging adults feel in-between, on the way to adulthood but not there yet. Nevertheless, they have a high level of optimism about what the future holds for them.</p><p>In the current climate, emerging adults are facing more instability than ever before. Whether it’s starting university, forging new relationships, or entering the job market – the uncertainty surrounding these milestones has presented many new challenges, and exacerbated the more common anxieties of adjusting to change. We’ve put together a reading list of books that address some of the key issues facing emerging adults – in areas such as education, work, relationships, and mental health – and provide advice and approaches for managing this turbulent stage of life.</p><p><a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://global.oup.com/academic/product/mood-prep-101-9780190914301"><strong>Mood Prep 101: A Parent’s Guide to Preventing Depression and Anxiety in College-Bound Teens</strong></a> by Carol Landau</p><p>This book answers the question most parents have – “What can we do?” – when it comes to college-bound teens who may be vulnerable to anxiety and depression. This timely book empowers parents by providing strategies for helping their children psychologically prepare for college and adulthood, as well as by addressing and alleviating the anxiety parents themselves may feel about kids leaving home for the first time. Landau shows parents how they can promote healthy communication and problem-solving skills, and how they can help young people learn to better regulate emotions and tolerate distress.</p><p><img height="408" src="https://d1pawtlfzz7188.cloudfront.net/60fafaa33598a1337dec1988d6b2b205e4f5afc8fe35371270bc309699f96bf0/EU7D-9nEPVo.jpg?response-content-disposition=inline&amp;Expires=1597332007&amp;Signature=SXf8uEz8myKuqHlBLgClWW+G8TKK7TVXOHfJbqG9kk4llzm8IRJBjQ94rVp0mmB/D7on4h1u9kSNivVLy8eDlLv5RQS17/QsvsnbswWEhejZ2QP/oJ1x0wuyH/1UswcF48Xa2yP9als7Huv+94mHpXo0i8R7L8F6UXuyCE2iGw3Md6F+wHLX+if+FblEwCEV4dfZ8++DR5kgDZ6CsimN8YTBGi538phOrug9biJAOeZpxHcL1K4dLPFXuhJ1Qwt4of4VzkknlgFTYivA5l84vM1n7VGg72BIfbkC+iWqV7T75dD0JZMjERo6qqVbPpF+NYJNUcgwNxfXR4lBGrDDpw==&amp;Key-Pair-Id=APKAJAX54V4IT7A2GGEA" width="272" /></p><p><a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://global.oup.com/academic/product/cognitive-skills-you-need-for-the-21st-century-9780197529003"><strong>Cognitive Skills You Need for the 21st Century</strong></a> by Stephen Reed</p><p>How can young people today prepare for the workplace of the future?

                <h4><a href="https://ptrrupprecht.wordpress.com/2020/08/19/alignment-tools/">Alignment tools</a></h4>

<p>This blog posts covers some tools and techniques that I’m typically using to align two-photon microscopes. If you’re an expert, you will probably find nothing new, but if you haven’t been doing this for years, this might offer you some pieces of inspiration.</p>



<p>Aligning a microscope is the process of optimizing the parts to produce better images than before. A useful overview of basic alignment procedures for two-photon microscopes has been put together in this <a href="https://www.scientifica.uk.com/neurowire/labhacks-how-to-align-your-laser-for-two-photon-imaging">#LabHacks blog post</a> by Scientifica. It also includes safety advice (which I will not repeat here; keep in mind that lasers, especially pulsed IR-laser, are really dangerous, and all safety instructions of your institute and lab must always be obeyed!)</p>



<p>Microscope alignment still seems to be a secret art that most microscope users are afraid of. It is not by principle difficult to learn, but it is a practical skill and requires both patience and a mentor who shows where to buy stuff and how to touch the mechanical and optical elements. Most people working with microscopes are prevented from learning because they are afraid to touch anything. This blog post is intended to help lower the fear of optical alignment – by showing that the tools used for alignment can be very simple.</p>



<p></p>



<p><strong>1. Adjust the beam to a given height above the optical breadboard</strong></p>



<p>After the beam comes out of the laser, you often want to keep the beam in one single plane parallel to the table, in order to keep things simple. In other words, the distance of the beam from the optical table should be the same everywhere. One way to achieve this is to use mounted pinholes (e.g., <a href="https://www.thorlabs.com/newgrouppage9.cfm?objectgroup_id=206">these ones from Thorlabs</a>). However, it is sometimes difficult to properly see where the beams hits the pinhole, which results in imprecise alignment and unnecessary uncertainty. When I worked with <a href="https://www.embl.de/research/units/cbb/prevedel/members/index.php?s_personId=CP-60022898">Robert Prevedel </a>in 2013/2014, he showed me a simple trick which makes it very easy to adjust all beam positions to the same height. He used a small hex key and two washers to clamp it horizontally onto an inverted post with a screw, as shown below. The surfaces of the hex key lead to a very nice horizontal alignment, and the precise height indicated by the hex key can be used to (1) adjust the beam itself or (2) to consistently adjust the height of a set of pin holes. It is useful to have and very simple to make.</p>

<p></p>



<p><strong>2.</strong> <strong>Printed-out resolution targets</strong></p>



<p>Is the beam centered in a given aperture, for example the cage system of the microscope’s tube lens? Normally, I would use a threaded or cage-mounted iris (e.g., <a href="https://www.thorlabs.com/newgrouppage9.cfm?objectgroup_id=1479">this one</a>), but in other cases spatial constraints do not allow this, or the beam can only be viewed from an angle, and it can be difficult to judge whether the beam scattering from the iris is centered or not. </p>



<p>However, if the laser power is low enough not to burn paper, I simply paint resolution targets with Powerpoint or Inkscape and print them out on a sheet of paper resolution targets. When I’m in a hurry, I simply draw it with a pen.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="" class="wp-image-6490" data-attachment-id="6490" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-description="" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="target" data-large-file="https://ptrrupprecht.files.wordpress.com/2020/06/target.jpg?w=640" data-medium-file="https://ptrrupprecht.files.wordpress.com/2020/06/target.jpg?w=300" data-orig-file="https://ptrrupprecht.files.wordpress.com/2020/06/target.jpg" data-orig-size="1300,975" data-permalink="https://ptrrupprecht.wordpress.com/target/" src="https://ptrrupprecht.files.wordpress.com/2020/06/target.jpg?w=1024" /></figure>



<p>For example, if I want to check whether a beam is collimated (that means, the beam does not change its diameter a lot over the distance), I use these alignment targets as a reference and as a guide for the eye.</p>



<p>Or I use some scotch to fix it into a given aperture, allowing me to check whether the beam is centered or not. Here illustrated for the aperture which is approximately located at the back focal plane of the objective. Does not require much work but is quite helpful.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="" class="wp-image-6485" data-attachment-id="6485" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-description="" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="target_1" data-large-file="https://ptrrupprecht.files.wordpress.com/2020/06/target_1.jpg?w=640" data-medium-file="https://ptrrupprecht.files.wordpress.com/2020/06/target_1.jpg?w=300" data-orig-file="https://ptrrupprecht.files.wordpress.com/2020/06/target_1.jpg" data-orig-size="3264,2448" data-permalink="https://ptrrupprecht.wordpress.com/target_1/" src="https://ptrrupprecht.files.wordpress.com/2020/06/target_1.jpg?w=1024" /></figure>

<p><strong>3. Using mirrors to look around corners</strong></p>



<p>One more practical problem in the above case is the viewing angle. Ideally, I would like to look at the alignment target from the top, but this would at the same time block the beam. To solve this (and many very similar problems), you can simply use a mirror shard. The photo below (left) shows a hand-held piece of <strong>mirror</strong> which allows to look at the alignment target in a relaxed way. It is difficult to see this from a single picture, but mirrors like this one (either hand-held or fixed in the setup) often make life much easier.</p>



<p>For more convenience, <strong>dental mirrors</strong> like <a href="https://www.the-lash-shop.com/products/milimeter-metal-dental-mirror-handheld-black-and-gold-plasma">this mirror</a> (photo below, right) are designed to conveniently look around corners and are of great use to look at pinholes from angles that are difficult to get at without mirrors.</p>



<p>However, be very careful with hand-held and any other moving mirrors! By chance, you might reflect the laser beam into your own eyes! Always be careful and think three times whether there is any chance that any reflection might hit your eyes.</p>

<p><strong>4. Retro-reflecting mirrors and lenses</strong></p>



<p>Usually, the laser beam should hit a lens at its center and at a 90° angle. To ensure that the beam is centered, one can use a) a cage system with a pinhole, or b) a <a href="https://www.thorlabs.com/newgrouppage9.cfm?objectgroup_id=1479">threaded pinhole</a> that can be screwed onto the lens directly, or c) a printed-out removable resolution target (see above). To make sure that, in addition, the laser beam hits the lens with a 90° angle, it is helpful to use back-reflections of the beam. Since a small fraction of the beam is back-reflected by the lens surface, it should ideally coincide with the incoming beam. This can be checked with an IR detection card or, for a visible beam, a piece of paper held close to (but not hiding the) incoming beam path.</p>



<p>Sometimes it is necessary to align a caged element or something similar without lenses that provide back-reflecting surfaces. In this case, you can simply use a mirror that reflects the entire beam back. This mirror can be screwed into a thread of a cage system. More often, it suffices to put a small and flat mirror shard at the flat back of the caged system. This does not provide the highest precision alignment, but is usually good enough for most purposes.</p>



<p>Be aware that back-reflections that go directly back into the laser can make the laser unstable. If a pulsed laser stops pulsing, first check whether any back-reflections could be the reason for it. </p>



<p></p>



<p><strong>5. Retro-reflecting gratings</strong></p>



<p>The main problem with back-reflections from lenses and mirrors is that the beam is often small and coincides with the incoming beam, making it difficult to properly identify.</p>



<p>In my <a href="https://www.fmi.ch/research-groups/groupleader.html?group=119">PhD lab</a>, I inherited a really cool tool that was used for alignment of a Sutter MOM scope and which I was, unfortunately, unable to find afterwards on the internet. It is basically a mirror, but with a sort of grating scratched into the mirror surface. Due to interference, the back-reflections were not simply a single beam, but a symmetric diffraction pattern that extended over several centimeters and could be conveniently used for alignment – much more useful and easier to use than the back-reflections of a lens or mirror. I guess that any flat reflective gratings (maybe even compact discs? I have to tried that) could be used for this same purpose.</p>



<p></p>



<p><strong>6. Wedge plates</strong></p>



<p>At several points of the beam path (before entering the back of the objective; after exiting a beam expander) the laser beam should ideally be <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collimated_beam">collimated</a>. The standard method that I used for years was to print out a resolution target made of paper (described above). I used it to check whether the beam changes its diameter when propagating freely over several meters. To this end, it is often necessary to deflect the beam with a mirror that must be temporarily inserted into the beam path.</p>



<p><a href="https://twitter.com/mesospim">Fabian Voigt</a> from my <a href="https://www.hifo.uzh.ch/en/research/helmchen.html">current lab in Zürich</a> also showed me the more professional way to check for collimation, using a wedge plate. Wedge plates can be used for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shearing_interferometer">shearing interferometers</a> (<a href="https://www.thorlabs.com/newgrouppage9.cfm?objectgroup_id=2970">Thorlabs product</a>, <a href="https://www.edmundoptics.com/f/paralinetrade-collimation-tester/11575/">EO product</a>). They generate an interference pattern which can be used to very precisely check the collimation of the beam.</p>

<p>Fabian also kindly pointed me to a paper (<a href="https://www.osapublishing.org/oe/abstract.cfm?uri=oe-23-11-13833">Tsai et al., 2015</a>) which mentions that the pattern seen from a shearing interferometer can also be used to analyze less obvious properties of the beam, like coma and astigmatism aberrations (<a href="https://www.osapublishing.org/ao/abstract.cfm?uri=ao-39-28-5179">Okuda et al., 2000</a>). It would be cool to have a look-up table of typical interferograms and the corresponding wavefront shapes and aberrations!</p>



<p></p>



<p><strong>7. Alignment lasers</strong></p>



<p>Another tool that Fabian showed to me was an alignment laser.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="" class="wp-image-6503" data-attachment-id="6503" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-description="" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;2.4&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;iPhone 5&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;1571242397&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;4.12&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;400&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0.05&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;1&quot;}" data-image-title="img_3787" data-large-file="https://ptrrupprecht.files.wordpress.com/2020/08/img_3787.jpg?w=640" data-medium-file="https://ptrrupprecht.files.wordpress.com/2020/08/img_3787.jpg?w=300" data-orig-file="https://ptrrupprecht.files.wordpress.com/2020/08/img_3787.jpg" data-orig-size="3264,2448" data-permalink="https://ptrrupprecht.wordpress.com/img_3787/" src="https://ptrrupprecht.files.wordpress.com/2020/08/img_3787.jpg?w=1024" /></figure>



<p>This alignment laser is basically a continuous wave-visible light laser that goes through a optical fiber and afterwards enters a beam coupler. I used a shearing interferometer (described above) to make sure that the outgoing beam was collimated, and then used the collimated beam for backward alignment.</p>



<p>Backward alignment means to insert the collimated beam of the alignment laser at the location of the microscope’s back focal plane and then aligning the microscope’s components in a backward manner (tube lens -&gt; scan lens -&gt; scanners -&gt; etc.; instead of forward alignment, which starts at the pulsed laser and goes forward until it ends up at the objective). This is helpful for example when two or more separate incoming beams are combined. A second advantage of the alignment laser is that the laser beam is, unlike the near-IR pulsed laser, visible to the human eye.</p>



<p></p>



<p><strong>8. Continuous wave (cw) mode for a pulsed Ti:Sa laser</strong></p>



<p>Standard two-photon microscopes are based on pulsed lasers that have a center wavelength adjusted between 800 and 1000 nm. The light is therefore invisible to the human eye (except for some faint spectral components when the center wavelength is adjusted to 800 nm) and comes with high average power (&gt;1 W, or often much more) and in ultra-short high-energy pulses, making it a very dangerous thing to deal with. IR viewer cards and IR viewers, or less expensive solutions based on <a href="https://labrigger.com/blog/2015/04/20/inexpensive-ir-viewer-options/">simple cameras/webcams</a>, can make the beam visible to our human eye, but I always found this very exhausting to work with. And being exhausted is not a good pre-condition for optical alignment, which requires the ability to stay focused and a sharp mind. Therefore, it would be great if it was possible to make the laser less dangerous: by preventing it from pulsing, by lowering the overall power, and by making it visible…</p>



<p>Fortunately, all of this is possible for the tunable wavelength Ti:Sa lasers (although not for the fixed 1040 nm lasers). For the Spectra Physics MaiTai lasers, the slightly old-fashioned user-interface (screenshot below) allows to manually lower the pump power (also called the “green power”). Change the wavelength to something visible (something between 700 and 750 nm), lower the green power until the pulsing (indicated by the green light in the main control window) stops and continue lowering the green power until the output IR power reaches something like 30-40 mW. This is still much more than the average laser pointer and still dangerous, but less so than a pulsed invisible beam.</p>



<p>It is however important to keep in mind that the control panel is not always 100% reliable. It switches between pulsing and non-pulsing as if these were binary states. But there is a sometimes continuous transition between the two, and sometimes the laser also becomes a bit unstable and oscillates between states – so, better watch the laser for a while before you start working with the beam.</p>

<p>I once talked to a laser engineer from Spectra Physics who told me that it would not be ideal to leave the laser in this non-pulsing state for too long (&gt;&gt; 1 hours). Probably this has something to do with inefficient energy conversion and the heat generated in this process. But I have to admit that I follow this recommendation simply because I don’t know it better. Lasers are complex things, and I mostly treat them in a pragmatic way, like a black box.</p>



<p></p>



<p><strong>9. Improvised test samples</strong></p>



<p>One of the most common mistakes that I keep seeing is to set up a microscope and then try to test it with a real sample, like a living brain of a transgenic mouse. That’s really not the best way to proceed. Instead, always test your microscope with a simple, bright and dead sample. (And, ideally in addtion also with sub-diffraction beads.)</p>



<p>For example, you can use colored plastic items (for example <a href="https://www.chroma.com/products/accessories/92001-autofluorescent-plastic-slides">plastic slides</a>), perfect to test how homogeneous the FOV is. Or <a href="https://ptrrupprecht.wordpress.com/2018/04/25/springtime-for-two-photon-microscopy/">pollen grains</a> from any flowers outdoors during the pollen season. Or dead, small insects that you caught from your desk. Their surface will often be super bright under a two-photon microscope, especially if you remove the emission filters. Or simply a single strand of your hair (especially if you have still some pigments in them).</p>



<p>In general, most solid things are somehow autofluorescent, and it can be really fun to look at random things below the two-photon microscope. Pay attention not to kill the PMT detector (lower the initial PMT gain), since autofluorescence of natural things can be very bright.</p>

<p class="">The fusiform face area, or FFA, is a small region found on the <a href="https://www.neuroscientificallychallenged.com/directional-terms#inferior" target="_blank">inferior</a> (bottom) surface of the <a href="https://www.neuroscientificallychallenged.com/glossary/temporal-lobe" target="_blank">temporal lobe</a>.

This research led neuroscientists to hypothesize that certain <a href="https://www.neuroscientificallychallenged.com/glossary/neuron" target="_blank">neurons</a> are specialized to process information about faces, and that these neurons are essential to normal face perception. According to this view, the parts of the brain involved in face perception might be distinct from the parts of the brain involved in perceiving other things like objects. </p><p class="">In 1997, <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9151747/" target="_blank">researchers published a groundbreaking study</a> that not only supported the idea of face-specific processing in the brain, but also added some important anatomical detail. The study, by Nancy Kanwisher and colleagues, used <a href="https://www.neuroscientificallychallenged.com/glossary/functional-magnetic-resonance-imaging-fmri" target="_blank">functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI)</a> to identify areas of the brain that were highly active when participants looked at faces. In the process, the researchers found a region about the size of a blueberry on the <a href="https://www.neuroscientificallychallenged.com/directional-terms#inferior" target="_blank">inferior</a> (bottom) surface of the temporal lobe that displayed a disproportionate amount of activity when participants viewed faces—but not when they viewed other things like houses, hands, or cars. In most patients, this activity was seen predominantly on the right side of the brain.</p><p class="">The data suggested to Kanwisher and her fellow researchers that this region—found in a <a href="https://www.neuroscientificallychallenged.com/glossary/gyrus" target="_blank">gyrus</a> known as the <a href="https://www.neuroscientificallychallenged.com/glossary/fusiform-gyrus" target="_blank">fusiform gyrus</a>—was specialized for processing information about faces; they called it the <em>fusiform face area</em>, or FFA. The hypothesis that the FFA is a face-processing module aligned with previous imaging studies that had also linked face perception to this general area of the brain, as well as with cases of patients who had experienced damage to the FFA and subsequently developed a condition known as <em>prosopagnosia</em>, which involves an impairment in the ability to recognize faces.</p><p class="">Further studies also supported the hypothesis of Kanwisher et al. For example, an experiment with monkeys that recorded the activity of neurons in the FFA <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16456083/" target="_blank">found that 97% of the neurons in the area were active in response to facial imagery</a>, but not in response to images of things like objects or other body parts. And another study found that delivering short bursts of electrical charge to the FFA <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3517886/" target="_blank">caused disruptions in the perception of faces</a>. Today—over 20 years after the initial publication by Kanwisher et al. that coined the term <em>fusiform face area</em>—it’s safe to say there is convincing evidence that the FFA is involved in perceiving faces.</p><p class="">Nevertheless, there is still a great deal of debate about the details surrounding the anatomy and function of the FFA. For instance, <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22481071/">some argue</a> that while parts of the FFA may play a role in face perception, the region probably consists of multiple visual areas that should be considered as distinct (both anatomically and functionally) rather than as one structure devoted to face perception. Additionally, some argue that—rather than being localized primarily to the FFA—face recognition involves <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5345271/">a network of brain regions that extends beyond just the FFA to include other parts of the occipital and temporal lobes as well</a>. According to both of these perspectives, attributing such a large role in face perception to the FFA alone may be a bit of an oversimplification. </p><p class="">But probably the loudest critique of the idea that the FFA is a primary face-processing area of the brain is the suggestion that the FFA is not only specialized for the perception of faces, but also for the perception of all objects we have a high level of familiarity and experience with. This idea is sometimes referred to as the <em>expertise hypothesis</em>, and it suggests that the FFA is activated in response to faces because we are, to some degree, face experts. For example, <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10649576/" target="_blank">one study found activity in the FFA to also be increased</a> in response to objects like cars and birds, and the increase was correlated with the degree of expertise someone had in identifying these objects (birdwatchers and car aficionados displayed greater activity). <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21752997/" target="_blank">Another study found the FFA to be active when chess experts</a> viewed chess positions on a chessboard, and yet <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25452573/" target="_blank">another found that experienced radiologists had more activity in the FFA</a> when viewing x-rays than med students did. </p><p class="">The expertise hypothesis, however, has also faced its fair share of criticism. The studies supporting the expertise hypothesis have tended to be small, and often the effects seen in those studies have not been very large. Nevertheless, <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31276714/" target="_blank">a 2019 analysis of the results of 18 studies</a> found that, even when the methodological concerns stated above are taken into consideration, the evidence strongly favors the expertise hypothesis. Thus, the precise role of the FFA in face perception continues to be debated. </p><p class=""><strong>References (in addition to linked text above):</strong></p><p class="">Burns EJ, Arnold T, Bukach CM.

                <h4><a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/633749722/0/oupblogpsychology/">How parents can support their teenagers starting college in uncertain times</a></h4>

<p>How do you reassure and prepare for college during this time of crisis?  I have been treating high school and college students for over 30 years and this is a season like no other. Previously, parents were often ambivalent; melancholy about their children growing up and moving away but happy for the privilege of college education. They wonder, how will my child do on their own? Teenagers are often excited, but anxious about social adjustment and new academic demands. Now, in this time of pandemic, financial crisis, and urgency about racial justice, all those typical emotions are overshadowed by a deep uncertainty about the future. Parents are emotionally exhausted and trying to cope with their own fears; this makes the college goodbye talk much more complicated. There is no clear path for the first year or even the first few months of college. Will there be on-campus, in-person classes, distance learning or a hybrid? Many students will not even be leaving in the fall, due to health or financial concerns, or universities’ new schedules with staggered start times. Or will parents say goodbye to their child, only to have colleges close a few months later?</p><p>Students will need more support this year. Symptoms of anxiety and depression, already extremely prevalent among teenagers, have risen significantly during the pandemic. Before the pandemic, the rate of major depressive disorder in teens was 13% overall. A recent sample of college-age people revealed that now over 40% were experiencing depression or anxiety. We need to be concerned about all our teenagers, especially those who were suffering from a psychological disorder before the pandemic.</p><p>So, how to proceed?  Here are some things it’s important for parents to do.</p><p>First, provide validation and positive framing. Parents can confirm their children’s feelings that this is a challenging time but still frame the situation positively. The message to a child should be, “We believe that you are ready. Yes, the situation is uncertain. There may well be disappointments or sudden changes and we will all need to be flexible, but we have confidence in you and will still be here for you.” It’s important for parents to approach the situation with an openness and a mindset toward growth. Parents should help teenagers not to fear failure as it is can be part of the ongoing educational process. This type of framing can and increase confidence.</p><p>Parents should also emphasize distress tolerance. Many parents, in the hopes of protecting children from pain, do not help them develop distress tolerance and rush to reassure them or solve their problems. Teenagers are often aware of their strengths and weaknesses, but during a stressful time like this one, they may overlook the coping skills that served them well in the past. Parents should remind their children that negative emotions do not need to be avoided or feared; that they experienced sadness or fear in their lives before and may well again, but they cope and grow. If teens do not avoid negative emotions, they will experience them and see that feelings are temporary. Similarly, parents need to accept that you’re their children will have some bad days but parent do not need to “fix” the situation.</p><p>Parents must also clarify that the college experience fosters the joy of engagement.<strong> </strong>I see engagement—with a professor, other students, a course of study or an extracurricular activity—as key to a positive college experience. Parents can help children her appreciate that college, even though it may be different from what they imagined, can be an exciting time to explore interests. Engagement is not strictly academic. For LGBTQI teens, college may offer greater acceptance and opportunity. Minority and first generation students, as well as those with learning differences, can find student groups and programs that may help address their needs.</p><p>Parents should identify the ways to obtain psychological help.  There are counseling centers on most campuses and psychotherapy is viewed by most people as not only acceptable but common and normal. Don’t let shame get in the way. Deans and chaplains can provide guidance and also facilitate referrals and many centers offer online scheduling. Parents with children who have  been treated for a psychological problem should plan ahead for ongoing.</p><p>Finally, parents should use their expertise as parents to identify additional specific areas of concern. Parents know their own children<strong> </strong>better than anyone else and after years of living together, they can probably enumerate what types of issues worry them, whether social anxiety, academic limitations, sex, body image, substance use and many other issues. Important for parents to let this information guide their conversations. Their teenagers will feel validated and supported.</p><p><em>Featured Image Credit: <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://www.freepik.com/free-photo/student-leaving-school-after-classes_1314101.htm">Image</a> by Freepik</em></p><p>The post <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://blog.oup.com/2020/08/how-parents-can-support-their-teenagers-starting-college-in-uncertain-times/">How parents can support their teenagers starting college in uncertain times</a> appeared first on <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://blog.oup.com">OUPblog</a>.</p><img align="left" border="0" height="1" hspace="0" src="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/i/633749722/0/oupblogpsychology" style="border: 0; float: left; margin: 0; padding: 0; width: 1px!important; height: 1px!important;" width="1" /><div style="clear: both; padding-top: 0.2em;"><a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/2/633749722/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/fbshare20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/28/633749722/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/fblike20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/30/633749722/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/googleplus20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/16/633749722/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/linkedin20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/29/633749722/oupblogpsychology,"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/pinterest20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/1/633749722/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/reddit20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/24/633749722/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/twitter20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/19/633749722/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/email20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/20/633749722/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/rss20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a><h3 style="clear: left; padding-top: 10px;">Related Stories</h3><ul><li><a href="https://blog.oup.com/2020/08/communicating-and-connecting-with-your-teenager-leaving-for-college/" rel="nofollow">Communicating and connecting with your teenager leaving for college</a></li><li><a href="https://blog.oup.com/2020/09/do-you-feel-sorry-for-first-year-university-students/" rel="nofollow">Do you feel sorry for first year university students?</a></li><li><a href="https://blog.oup.com/2020/09/searching-for-magic-bullet-antibodies-to-combat-covid-19/" rel="nofollow">Searching for “magic bullet” antibodies to combat COVID-19</a></li></ul> </div>

<p>In 2004, 16-year-old Cyntoia Brown shot and killed a man who paid her for sex – a position she was forced into by an older man who took advantage of her. Brown never denied shooting the man (in fact, she was the one who called the police the next day), but she claimed it was an act of self-defense because she believed the man was grabbing a gun to shoot her. Brown was charged and convicted of aggravated robbery and first-degree murder and sentenced to life in prison. In 2017 her case gained national attention when celebrities and others <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://www.npr.org/2017/12/01/567789605/cyntoia-brown-case-highlights-how-child-sex-trafficking-victims-are-prosecuted">petitioned</a> for her clemency. In 2019 the Governor of Tennessee <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://www.npr.org/2019/08/07/749025458/cyntoia-brown-released-after-15-years-in-prison-for-murder">granted clemency</a> and Brown was released from prison.</p><p>As a Black girl, Brown ’s case, and others like hers, ultimately reflect the legacy of racism in the United States—a long legacy that can shape the life trajectory of racial minority youth, <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://www.oxfordclinicalpsych.com/view/10.1093/med-psych/9780190056742.001.0001/med-9780190056742">leading them at a vastly disproportionate rate toward involvement in the legal system</a>.</p><p>A history of race-based oppression, intergenerational trauma, and resulting poverty puts racial minorities at risk for becoming victims. <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://www.oxfordclinicalpsych.com/view/10.1093/med-psych/9780190056742.001.0001/med-9780190056742-chapter-2">Child sex traffickers prey on already-vulnerable child victims</a>, convincing them that they have no other options in life than to sell their bodies and that no one else will want them. Brown’s childhood was difficult. She was in and out of the juvenile justice system and eventually ran away and began living on the streets. There she began a relationship with an older man who abused, raped, and sold her as a prostitute. She was manipulated and disparaged by this man, who <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://www.oxfordclinicalpsych.com/view/10.1093/med-psych/9780190056742.001.0001/med-9780190056742-chapter-2">told</a> her “some people were born whores, and that [she] was one… and nobody’d want [her] but him.” Fearing the beating and rape she expected if she returned to her abuser without money, Brown stole from the man she shot in self-defense.</p><p>Once racial minority juveniles come into contact with the legal system, racism can exacerbate negative outcomes at many levels. For example, like laypeople, police officers’ stereotypes <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://www.oxfordclinicalpsych.com/view/10.1093/med-psych/9780190056742.001.0001/med-9780190056742-chapter-9">can influence how they perceive and respond to juveniles of color</a>, including the way officers interrogate those suspected of committing crimes. Racial minorities suffer from the added stress and anxiety associated with stereotype threat (i.e., concerns about being stereotyped as criminal because of their race), <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://www.oxfordclinicalpsych.com/view/10.1093/med-psych/9780190056742.001.0001/med-9780190056742-chapter-10">which may impair their ability to understand their Miranda Rights<em> </em>and pressure them to waive their rights</a>—exactly what Brown did. She did not understand the value of having an attorney during her initial interrogations.</p><p>Racism’s legacy has also been fear and suspicion—the fear that white Americans have of African Americans in particular, even youngsters. Compared to white adolescents, racial minorities are <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://www.oxfordclinicalpsych.com/view/10.1093/med-psych/9780190056742.001.0001/med-9780190056742-chapter-9">often perceived</a> as older and more mature than they actually are, and they are in turn blamed more for their actions. Psychological research has established that cognitive and psychosocial development is not fully developed until adulthood, leaving youth of all races more likely to engage in impulsive, risky decision making without considering the long-term consequences of their actions. But whereas white juveniles’ actions may be attributed to these developmental limitations, minority youth do not receive the same benefit of the doubt. Brown was not only Black and mature looking, but she also suffered from vulnerabilities that further impaired her cognitive functioning: Alcohol-Related Neurodevelopmental Disorder (a form of Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder), which impaired and delayed the development of various cognitive abilities, including her ability to control her behavior and to understand the consequences of her actions. She was cognitively not even as old as she actually was, and far younger than she appeared.</p><p>Not only are racial minority youth perceived as older and more culpable than white youth, but minority girls are stereotyped as promiscuous and deviant. As a result, girls of color who are subjected to sexual exploitation are <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://www.oxfordclinicalpsych.com/view/10.1093/med-psych/9780190056742.001.0001/med-9780190056742-chapter-2">often blamed</a> for their own victimization and labeled as offenders, not victims. Moreover, when they are charged with crimes, they are also <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://www.oxfordclinicalpsych.com/view/10.1093/med-psych/9780190056742.001.0001/med-9780190056742-chapter-11">more likely to be tried in adult criminal court</a> rather than a rehabilitation-oriented juvenile court. Brown’s case was no different—rather than consider her a child victim of sexual exploitation, <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2019/oct/23/cyntoia-brown-long-trafficked-enslaved-jailed-for-life-at-16-and-fighting-back">Brown was labeled a teen prostitute and tried as an adult.</a></p><p>Cyntoia Brown’s case illustrates the multifaceted ways in which racism influences minority youth’s life experiences as well as their interactions with the legal system. Although much progress has been made to end racism in the United States, there is still much that needs to be done to ensure that all children, regardless of race or ethnicity, have an equal opportunity to live and thrive in society. Meanwhile, social science has much to offer in exposing the legacies of racism in the legal context, and developing ways to combat it.</p><p><em>Featured Image Credit: <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://pixabay.com/photos/fence-freedom-prison-hands-fingers-2163951/">Image</a> by Fifaliana-joy via Pixabay</em></p><p>The post <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://blog.oup.com/2020/08/cyntoia-brown-and-the-legacy-of-racism-for-children-in-the-legal-system/">Cyntoia Brown and the legacy of racism for children in the legal system</a> appeared first on <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://blog.oup.com">OUPblog</a>.</p><img align="left" border="0" height="1" hspace="0" src="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/i/633364024/0/oupblogpsychology" style="border: 0; float: left; margin: 0; padding: 0; width: 1px!important; height: 1px!important;" width="1" /><div style="clear: both; padding-top: 0.2em;"><a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/2/633364024/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/fbshare20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/28/633364024/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/fblike20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/30/633364024/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/googleplus20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/16/633364024/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/linkedin20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/29/633364024/oupblogpsychology,"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/pinterest20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/1/633364024/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/reddit20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/24/633364024/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/twitter20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/19/633364024/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/email20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/20/633364024/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/rss20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a><h3 style="clear: left; padding-top: 10px;">Related Stories</h3><ul><li><a href="https://blog.oup.com/2020/07/how-education-could-reduce-corruption/" rel="nofollow">How education could reduce corruption</a></li><li><a href="https://blog.oup.com/2020/09/do-you-feel-sorry-for-first-year-university-students/" rel="nofollow">Do you feel sorry for first year university students?</a></li><li><a href="https://blog.oup.com/2020/09/smaller-prisons-are-smarter/" rel="nofollow">Smaller prisons are smarter</a></li></ul> </div>

<img alt="" class="attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image" height="110" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2020/08/food-140x110.jpg" style="display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;" width="140" /><p><a href="https://www.ers.usda.gov/webdocs/publications/94849/err-270.pdf?v=963.1">Food security</a> – or “access by all people at all times to enough food for an active, healthy life” – is a leading determinant of health. Food insecure adults (i.e., those without access to adequate food) experience poor nutrition, obesity, and chronic inflammation. Perhaps, unsurprisingly, food insecurity is associated with leading causes of death and disability—including cancer, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, stroke, and diabetes.</p>
<p>Women disproportionately experience food insecurity, and sexual minority women (i.e., lesbian, bisexual, and heterosexual women reporting same-sex behavior; SMW) may be at greater risk. SMW experience discrimination due to their minority gender and sexual orientation that depletes their access to employment, living wages, and social supports. The systematic disruption of these economic resources may place SMW at greater risk for experiencing economic instability and related concerns, including food insecurity.</p>
<p>Several solutions exist to alleviate food insecurity in the general population. In the United States (U.S.), the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (formerly, “food stamps”; SNAP) is a means-based program that provides financial assistance to participating low- and no- income households. SNAP participation reduces food insecurity in the general population, and may be an effective tool to reduce food insecurity in SMW. At the local level, emergency food assistance (e.g., food pantries, soup kitchens) are provided by non-profit and religious organizations to provide in-kind nutrition assistance to individuals and families in need, regardless of income. However, emergency food assistance is not associated with long-term reductions in food insecurity. Few studies have investigated differences in SNAP use and emergency food assistance by sexual orientation; as such, it is not known how these resources may be leveraged to address food insecurity in SMW.</p>
<p><strong>Our study</strong></p>
<p>We used publicly available data from the 2005-2014 <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/index.htm">National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey</a> (NHANES) to investigate the prevalence of food insecurity and food assistance (SNAP use and emergency food assistance) in women, by sexual orientation. Data collected from 7,279 women was weighted to derive U.S. population-representative estimates. Of all respondents, 90.4% identified as exclusively heterosexual, 5.1% identified as heterosexual but also reported having sex with women, 3.4% identified as bisexual, and 1.2% identified as lesbian.</p>
<p><strong>Food insecurity</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>Bisexual women reported the highest prevalence of food insecurity</p></blockquote>
<p>Over 25% of SMW experienced food insecurity over the past 12-months (vs 13.1% of exclusively heterosexual women). Bisexual women reported the highest prevalence of food insecurity (27.3%) followed by lesbian women (25.5%). Alarmingly, compared to exclusively heterosexual women, SMW were 50-84% more likely to experience at least one period during the past 12-months where eating patterns were disrupted and food intake was reduced due to lack of money or other resources.</p>
<p><strong>Food assistance</strong></p>
<p>Over 20% of SMW reported using the federal Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP, formerly referred to as “food stamps”) in the past 12-months; however, in fully adjusted models, the prevalence rate of women using SNAP did not differ by sexual orientation. This finding is in contrast to <a href="https://williamsinstitute.law.ucla.edu/publications/lgbt-food-insecurity-snap/">prior studies</a> that have found differences in SNAP use by sexual orientation.</p>
<blockquote><p>Lesbians reported highest prevalence of emergency food assistance (17.5%), and they were 89% more likely to use emergency food assistance than exclusively heterosexual women</p></blockquote>
<p>Emergency food participation has not been explored in previous population-based studies of food insecurity in sexual minority populations. In our study, lesbians reported highest prevalence of emergency food assistance (17.5%), and they were 89% more likely to use emergency food assistance than exclusively heterosexual women. However, heterosexual women reporting same-sex behavior were also 43% more likely to report past 12-month use of emergency food assistance than exclusively heterosexual women.</p>
<p><strong>Reducing disparities</strong></p>
<p>This study is among the first to document disparities in food insecurity and emergency food assistance in SMW. Our results highlight inequities faced by SMW in accessing adequate and nutritious food. This is especially concerning as SMW’s increased rates of food insecurity may contribute to chronic disease disparities—including cancer and diabetes—seen in this population.</p>
<p>Results suggest a need for culturally-specific interventions to reduce food insecurity disparities. One solution is to increase SNAP participation by SMW. By partnering with lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) organizations, public health departments may use targeted marketing and outreach to increase awareness of SNAP requirements and enrollment among food insecure SMW. For SMW who do not qualify for SNAP, local solutions may include increasing access to LGBT-specific food pantries sponsored by community-based organizations and improving the variety, amount, and nutrition of food distributed by these resources.</p>

                <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/~r/plos/Blog/~3/ihd7XnvNt8g/">PLOS and LibLynx Partner to Develop Open Access Analytics</a></h4>

<p><em>The following press release was issued on Wednesday, August 12 at 8am Pacific.</em></p>



<p>SAN FRANCISCO (August 12, 2020) — The Public Library of Science (PLOS) and LibLynx announced a partnership today to develop ground-breaking analytics that better communicate the usage and impact of Open Access (OA) content.</p>



<p>A critical component in the development of sustainable funding models for OA is the ability to communicate impact in ways that are meaningful to a diverse range of internal and external stakeholders, including institutional partners, funders, and authors.</p>



<p>While traditional paywall publishers can take advantage of industry standard COUNTER reports to communicate usage to subscribing libraries, no similar standard exists for OA content.</p>



<p>“One of the great benefits of our Open Access agreements with institutions is the development of next generation metrics for native-OA content,” said Sara Rouhi, Director of Strategic Partnerships, PLOS. “LibLynx is a crucial collaborator and thought leader in this space and we’re eager to build upon existing COUNTER-compliant metrics and share new approaches to reporting with the broader OA community”</p>



<p>These new approaches will provide stakeholders with reports customized to meet their changing needs and underpin the development of new business models. Reports will be trialed and piloted with the PLOS community over the next 6 to 12 months, contributing to the development of future standards in this area.</p>



<p>“Together LibLynx and PLOS have a unique opportunity to develop new metrics for evaluating open access content — an emerging need for libraries and consortia as they work to evaluate the benefits of transformative and native-open access publishing agreements,” said Tim Lloyd, CEO, LibLynx. “Our depth and breadth of experience in this arena, along with the organizational data available from PSI Metrics, will help provide PLOS and their partners access to real-time, on-demand reporting on the impact of their content.”</p>

                <h4><a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/633090054/0/oupblogpsychology/">How the healthcare system is failing people with eating disorders</a></h4>

<p>One death every 52 minutes occurs in the United States as a direct result of an eating disorder, according to a <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/striped/report-economic-costs-of-eating-disorders/">report</a> by the Strategic Training Initiative for the Prevention of Eating Disorders, the Academy for Eating Disorders, and Deloitte Access Economics. I have studied eating disorders for over 30 years, and I was shocked by this finding. From 2018-2019, roughly 6,910 females and 3,290 males between the ages of 15 and 64 years lost their lives due to an eating disorder. The personal tragedy for each family member and friend is beyond the scope of even the most comprehensive study of social and economic costs of eating disorders. But the economic cost of these deaths came to $8.8 billion dollars ($8,800,000,000.00), dwarfing the $4.6 billion dollar investment our nation makes to understand and treat eating disorders. If I were an economist, I might try to explain how the difference between investment and costs represents a margin, but I’m not. Instead, I want to focus on how these deaths occur in the margins of our health care system and the steps needed to prevent these fatalities.</p><p>The report includes a case study of Hannah and demonstrates the need for better health care coverage for eating disorders. When Hannah was 13-years old, she developed anorexia, lost a third of her body weight and developed a serious heart problem that required hospitalization. After approximately six months of inpatient treatment, she was discharged and experienced a relapse that required intensive outpatient care. This was not covered by her parents’ insurance. Her mother estimated spending $10,000 in a single month to keep her daughter alive. Hannah is now recovered and advocates for better insurance coverage for eating disorder treatment, particularly for military families, like her own.</p><p>This story does not represent an isolated case. Two weeks after the report was released, the following crossed my Twitter feed: “Friend diagnosed with AN (female in midlife). Kaiser wrongfully denying her authorization to a higher LOC [level of care]. Although she’s suffered for many years, she is not treatment resistant, as Kaiser claims. Resting heart rate is 35.”</p><p>A resting heart rate of 35 beats per minute meets <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://www.aedweb.org/resources/online-library/publications/medical-care-standards">criteria</a> for hospitalization. Low heart rate signifies that the body is shutting down. Denying medical care to an eating disorder patient in medical crisis is wrong. But it happens too often in a health care system that interprets parity for mental health as only applying to brain-based disorders. The <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://www.aedweb.org/resources/online-library/publications/nine-truths">myth</a> that people choose to have an eating disorder is as misguided as the idea that someone would choose to have cancer.</p><p>Researchers and advocates have made huge efforts to increase recognition that eating disorders are <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/eat.20589">biologically-based disorders</a>, with genetic make-up contributing as much to their development as it does to the development of schizophrenia or asthma. If this stops a single person from being denied treatment to save their lives, good. But I’m still waiting for any explanation for why the cause of an eating disorder has anything to do with whether or not we should try to save a person’s life. In <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamapsychiatry/fullarticle/207163">one study</a>, we found that the leading cause of death in anorexia nervosa was suicide. If treatment prevents a person from taking her life, that saved life is easily worth the investment. It makes no difference whether the prevented death would have been caused by self-poisoning, self-starvation, or self-induced vomiting.</p><p>We need more money in research funding to find better treatments, preventions, and cures for eating disorders. In 2019, the single largest funder of research, the <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://report.nih.gov/categorical_spending.aspx">National Institutes of Health</a>, invested roughly $8/person with an eating disorder compared to $60,831/person with <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://www.cdc.gov/tb/statistics/tbcases.htm">tuberculosis</a>. The gap between funding for mental health and almost any other domain of health is well-known. But beyond that gap, eating disorders are marginalized within the field of mental health, receiving $8/person compared to $33/person for <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/statistics/major-depression.shtml">depression</a> and <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://cdn1.sph.harvard.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/1267/2020/07/Social-Economic-Cost-of-Eating-Disorders-in-US.pdf">$69/person for schizophrenia</a> research in 2019. This funding gap contributes to the gaping difference between <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://www.fda.gov/consumers/free-publications-women/depression-medicines">28 FDA-approved medications for depression</a> versus 0 for anorexia. Without greater funding to produce better treatments, we won’t see better outcomes. And the best time intervene is at the first sign of a problem. Catching any disease in its earliest stages produces the best outcomes.</p><p>We need universal screening to promote early identification and intervention before the eating disorder progresses to a critical stage. While eating disorders lurk in the margins of awareness, we won’t see who is affected, we won’t see how they are affected, and we won’t know the full cost we pay for our ignorance. In the absence of universal screening, we will never know the true number of people killed by their eating disorder. No pathologist will ever “see” the eating disorder in a post-mortem exam, no matter how obvious the signs may be. In that same <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamapsychiatry/fullarticle/207163">study</a> where we found that suicide was the leading cause of death, we found that an eating disorder was never listed as the cause of death on the death certificate. Instead, we saw causes such as heart and liver failure in a 39-year-old woman who weighed less than half what a woman her age and height should weigh – less than half. In the absence of universal screening, we lose our best opportunity to prevent those deaths.</p><blockquote><p>We need to recognize eating disorders as serious mental illnesses that pose a threat to the health of our nation.</p><p>We need better health care coverage.</p><p>We need more funding for research.</p><p>We need universal screening.</p></blockquote><p><em>Featured Image Credit: </em><em>by Daan Stevens via <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://unsplash.com/photos/yGUuMIqjIrU">Unsplash</a></em></p><p>The post <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://blog.oup.com/2020/08/how-the-healthcare-system-is-failing-people-with-eating-disorders/">How the healthcare system is failing people with eating disorders</a> appeared first on <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://blog.oup.com">OUPblog</a>.</p><img align="left" border="0" height="1" hspace="0" src="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/i/633090054/0/oupblogpsychology" style="border: 0; float: left; margin: 0; padding: 0; width: 1px!important; height: 1px!important;" width="1" /><div style="clear: both; padding-top: 0.2em;"><a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/2/633090054/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/fbshare20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/28/633090054/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/fblike20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/30/633090054/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/googleplus20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/16/633090054/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/linkedin20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/29/633090054/oupblogpsychology,"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/pinterest20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/1/633090054/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/reddit20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/24/633090054/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/twitter20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/19/633090054/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/email20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/20/633090054/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/rss20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a><h3 style="clear: left; padding-top: 10px;">Related Stories</h3><ul><li><a href="https://blog.oup.com/2020/08/raising-a-teenager-with-an-eating-disorder-in-a-pandemic/" rel="nofollow">Raising a teenager with an eating disorder in a pandemic</a></li><li><a href="https://blog.oup.com/2020/09/do-you-feel-sorry-for-first-year-university-students/" rel="nofollow">Do you feel sorry for first year university students?</a></li><li><a href="https://blog.oup.com/2020/09/searching-for-magic-bullet-antibodies-to-combat-covid-19/" rel="nofollow">Searching for “magic bullet” antibodies to combat COVID-19</a></li></ul> </div>

                <h4><a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/632979100/0/oupblogpsychology/">How to prepare students for jobs in the 21st century</a></h4>

<p>A common goal for educators is to identify, and then teach, cognitive skills that are needed for the workplace. In 2017 a group of investigators at the Educational Testing Service in Princeton, New Jersey, <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.3102/0013189X19890600">investigated</a> which skills are needed as a result of the rapid changes occurring as the United States shifted from an industrial to an information-based economy. The organization analyzed 142,000 online job advertisements that were posted between February and April of that year. The most highly requested skills were oral communication (28%), written communication (23%), collaboration (22%), and problem solving (19%). The Educational Testing Service decided to label them “21<sup>st</sup>-century skills.” These skills are a combination of cognitive (nonroutine problem solving, critical thinking, metacognition), interpersonal (social), and intrapersonal (emotional, self-regulation) talents.</p><p>The World Economic Forum’s <em><a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~www3.weforum.org/docs/WEF_Future_of_Jobs_2018.pdf">Future of Jobs Report 2018</a></em> took a different approach by asking executives of some of the world’s largest employers to report on the latest employment, skills, and human investment trends across their industries. The survey revealed an accelerating demand for new specialist roles related to understanding and using the latest emerging technologies – AI and machine learning specialists, big data specialists, process automation experts, information security analysts, human-machine interaction designers, and robotics engineers. Skills such as creativity, originality, critical thinking, negotiation, and complex problem solving will, according to the report, become more valuable. The World Economic Forum predicted that there will also be more demand for leadership, emotional intelligence, and social influence skills.</p><p>These cognitive skills should be incorporated within courses taught at high schools, community colleges, and universities. An introduction to technological skills can begin in high school. In 2016, the College Board’s Advanced Placement Program oversaw the largest course launch in the program’s 60-year history with the release of <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://apcentral.collegeboard.org/pdf/ap-computer-science-principles-course-and-exam-description.pdf?course=ap-computer-science-principles">AP Computer Science Principles</a>. The course introduces students to the foundational concepts of the field and challenges them to explore how computing and technology can impact the world. In the 2018-19 school year more than 5,000 schools were offering the course. A second course, AP Computer Science A, focuses on computing skills related to programming in Java. The course teaches the foundational concepts of computer science to encourage broader participation. Its big ideas are creativity, abstraction, data and information, algorithms, programming, the internet, and global impact.</p><p>The College Board <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://www.collegeboard.org/releases/2019/participation-csp-nearly-doubles">announced</a> that nearly 100,000 students took the AP Computer Science Principles Exam in 2019, more than double the participation since the course launched during 2016-17 school year. During that period the number of female students, the number of Black/African American students, and the number of Hispanic/Latino students more than doubled.</p><p>A challenge for community colleges and universities is to design instruction for the increasing number of students who enter higher education without a declared major. A 2019 <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://www-chronicle-com.libproxy.sdsu.edu/article/How-Some-Colleges-Are-Helping/246913/?key=HngGmpmDh1Ozp8Ik-2G6XFI1SVT7LuhTKYD-bCGURaIwoJii8aqjFMQgzE4V6mzHbS1aVXR1NU9Xdmc4dEd5T0ZOVERfejRzVkRPVWx1NnV3OVBnOS1wdXVJQQ#.Xw8uKR9LEa0.gmail">article</a> in <em>The Chronicle of Higher Education</em> discussed how some institutions are preventing these students from wandering among courses. One solution is to ask incoming students to select an academic focus area or meta-major to help them explore topics that should appeal to them. In the fall of 2019, the entire University System of Georgia asked incoming freshmen to declare an academic focus area if unable to select a major. The University of Houston has a similar program based on the same concept.  These programs have been influenced by studies that find college students have trouble succeeding because they are faced with an overwhelming number of options.</p><p>Community colleges are evaluating a related project. The Association of American Colleges and Universities <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://www.aacu.org/press/press-releases/aacu-announces-twenty-institutions-new-guided-pathways-project">announced</a> that it had selected 20 colleges to participate in a two-year evaluation project. The goals of the project are to map students’ goals to pathways, help students choose and enter a program pathway, keep students on the path, and ensure that students are learning.</p><p>A guided approach can also be helpful for reducing changes in majors. Within three years of their initial enrollment <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://nces.ed.gov/pubs2018/2018434.pdf">approximately 30%</a> of undergraduates in associate and bachelor’s degree programs change their major at least once. But Georgia State University reduced changes in a major by 30 percent since it began its meta-majors program seven years ago. Those students who did change majors were more likely to have crossover credits.</p><p>Although clustering courses around a meta-major may be helpful for students with undeclared majors, the courses do not necessarily teach skills that are important for the future workplace. These skills include oral communication, written communication, collaboration, and problem solving. They also include creativity, originality, critical thinking, negotiation, and complex problem solving. These cognitive skills should be incorporated within cluster courses to prepare freshmen for skills that are likely to be in demand when they graduate. The creation of generic courses for all majors should also focus on these skills because they are relevant to all college graduates. Such generic courses have the advantage that they do not require students to select a major or even a cluster area.</p><p><em>Featured Image credit: <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://pixabay.com/photos/businesswoman-skills-ability-can-3641630/">Image</a> by Gerd Altmann via Pixabay</em>.</p><p>The post <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://blog.oup.com/2020/08/how-to-prepare-students-for-jobs-in-the-21st-century/">How to prepare students for jobs in the 21st century</a> appeared first on <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://blog.oup.com">OUPblog</a>.</p><img align="left" border="0" height="1" hspace="0" src="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/i/632979100/0/oupblogpsychology" style="border: 0; float: left; margin: 0; padding: 0; width: 1px!important; height: 1px!important;" width="1" /><div style="clear: both; padding-top: 0.2em;"><a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/2/632979100/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/fbshare20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/28/632979100/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/fblike20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/30/632979100/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/googleplus20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/16/632979100/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/linkedin20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/29/632979100/oupblogpsychology,"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/pinterest20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/1/632979100/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/reddit20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/24/632979100/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/twitter20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/19/632979100/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/email20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/20/632979100/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/rss20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a><h3 style="clear: left; padding-top: 10px;">Related Stories</h3><ul><li><a href="https://blog.oup.com/2020/09/do-you-feel-sorry-for-first-year-university-students/" rel="nofollow">Do you feel sorry for first year university students?</a></li><li><a href="https://blog.oup.com/2020/07/its-cheaper-to-preserve-the-amazon-than-we-might-think/" rel="nofollow">It’s cheaper to preserve the Amazon than we might think</a></li><li><a href="https://blog.oup.com/2020/09/the-role-of-masculinity-in-reforming-police-departments/" rel="nofollow">The role of masculinity in reforming police departments</a></li></ul> </div>

                <h4><a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/632789194/0/oupblogpsychology/">Raising a teenager with an eating disorder in a pandemic</a></h4>

<p>Many people have already written about the difficulties we’re having in the midst of COVID-19 – they are numerous and far-reaching, some as insidious as the disease itself. As researchers and clinicians in the field of eating disorders, we are now challenged to consider how we can best help those who are quarantined with a loved one experiencing symptoms of an eating problem. But for the family of a young person with an eating disorder, there are some specific concerns worth addressing.</p><p>First, families need to make sure underweight teens are eating enough.<strong> </strong>Family meals, in which support is provided by the household, are a mainstay of <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26092743/">Family Based Therapy</a>, the <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://www.jahonline.org/article/S1054-139X%2814%2900686-7/fulltext">treatment approach of choice</a> for many teens in need of weight restoration. In this therapy, parents take charge of meal planning, preparation, and supervision, until they can hand responsibility back to the teen. While this typically represents a big change from normal for teens, during these unusual pandemic times, families are eating more meals together than ever before. This may help make the process just a little easier. Because intake needs tend to be high to achieve renourishment, it is important for parents to have a stock of calorically dense foods in the pantry or fridge. To counteract the rigidity and stereotyped eating behavior characteristic of restrictive-type disorders, it’s critical to frequently include challenging foods. Parents can talk with their children about what is most helpful during mealtimes – maybe it’s cheerleading with encouragement or reminding them how important to their goals in sports or in school eating well and getting better is.</p><p>Families should also minimize the risk of binge eating.<strong> </strong>Parents may wonder, “if we are in the house so much now, should we get rid of foods that will tempt my teen to overdo it?” The truth is that binge eating is less about the food being eaten during the loss-of-control moment than it is a reflection of someone’s overall eating pattern, or a reaction to stressors (like feeling sad or anxious, or fighting with a friend or sibling) or circumstance (such as eating while watching Netflix or having constant, easy access to the kitchen). For these reasons, it’s more helpful to promote sticking with a pattern of eating regular meals and snacks, with a balance of nutritious, tasty foods. Parents can model non-eating-related coping strategies when feeling stressed, such as taking a walk, listening to upbeat music, or talking about it with someone. Parents can also initiate an activity and encourage a teen to join if it’s clear that he or she is having a hard time. Portioning food from large bags or serving containers in advance, having snack-size items on hand, and encouraging eating to happen at a table (rather than on the sofa) can also help minimize the chance of mindless overeating.</p><p>Additionally, it is important to be aware of body image concerns.<strong> </strong>The pandemic lifestyle may  lead to people feeling worse about how they look, exacerbating a negative body image. For example, it’s more tempting to dress down when socially distancing, and there may be fewer opportunities to get out and be active depending on the summer heat and humidity.</p><p>Research has shown that the amount of time spent on social media, especially in curating an online persona or posting selfies, is <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23453676/">negatively associated with body image, and disordered eating attitudes and behaviors</a>. In addition, some people with eating disorders describe difficulty inhibiting self-scrutiny as they are repeatedly confronted with their image while on Zoom or FaceTime. Parents should talk with their teenagers to determine if they’d like to work treating the experiences on social media or video chat platforms like exposures, leaning into the discomfort, or if they’d prefer to adjust video settings to minimize their image until they are ready to take on an exposure mindset. It’s also important to look for occasions for all family members to dress up to encourage variety in clothing choices. Unconditional body positivity need not be the goal – for most of us, <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://thefeedblog.com/2020/02/05/body-image-good-bad-and-in-between/">body neutral is the place to aim</a>.<strong> </strong></p><p>Just how much to talk about the eating disorder is a common problem for parents supporting children through recovery. And given the restrictions placed on us currently, parents might be noticing a lot and feel tempted to point out every concern. It <em>is</em> important to flag troublesome, observable behaviors, and to clearly communicate expectations around particular goals – be it completing a meal, varying exercise routines, or trying a new food. However, these conversations are sometimes best had at a calm moment outside of mealtime. And it is equally important to continue to talk to teens about other topics – for example, popular shows, the latest goings on in a friend group, or reactions to current events in the world. Part of moving beyond an eating problem is developing and investing in other aspects of identity; this can be cultivated in conversation that reminds a teen subtly that a parent knows that the teenage is <em>not </em>their eating disorder. He or she is so much more.</p><p>Coping with the COVID pandemic is challenging for all of us on many levels. This is equally or more true for parents of a youngster with an eating disorder. Although the basic strategies for helping do not change, there may be new opportunities to implement them and new situations to grapple with. And it is possible that increased time together as a family may yield some surprising benefits.</p><p><em>Featured Image Credit: </em><a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://www.freepik.com/free-photo/mother-with-daughter-cafe_3586578.htm"><em>Image</em></a><em> by prostooleh via Freepik</em>.</p><p>The post <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://blog.oup.com/2020/08/raising-a-teenager-with-an-eating-disorder-in-a-pandemic/">Raising a teenager with an eating disorder in a pandemic</a> appeared first on <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://blog.oup.com">OUPblog</a>.</p><img align="left" border="0" height="1" hspace="0" src="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/i/632789194/0/oupblogpsychology" style="border: 0; float: left; margin: 0; padding: 0; width: 1px!important; height: 1px!important;" width="1" /><div style="clear: both; padding-top: 0.2em;"><a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/2/632789194/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/fbshare20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/28/632789194/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/fblike20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/30/632789194/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/googleplus20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/16/632789194/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/linkedin20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/29/632789194/oupblogpsychology,"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/pinterest20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/1/632789194/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/reddit20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/24/632789194/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/twitter20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/19/632789194/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/email20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a> <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/20/632789194/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/rss20.png" style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;" /></a><h3 style="clear: left; padding-top: 10px;">Related Stories</h3><ul><li><a href="https://blog.oup.com/2020/09/the-role-of-masculinity-in-reforming-police-departments/" rel="nofollow">The role of masculinity in reforming police departments</a></li><li><a href="https://blog.oup.com/2020/09/searching-for-magic-bullet-antibodies-to-combat-covid-19/" rel="nofollow">Searching for “magic bullet” antibodies to combat COVID-19</a></li><li><a href="https://blog.oup.com/2020/08/coping-with-covid-deaths-and-what-cinema-tells-us/" rel="nofollow">Coping with COVID deaths and what cinema tells us</a></li></ul> </div>

<p>Here are our winning images:</p>
<h2><strong>Overall winner:</strong></h2>
<figure class="wp-caption alignnone" id="attachment_12056" style="width: 582px;"><img alt="" class=" wp-image-12056" height="368" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2020/07/Sick-2-300x193.jpg" width="572" /><div class="attachment-image--caption">Attribution: David Costantini</div><div class="attachment-image--source"></div></figure>
<p>Our overall winning image was taken by David Costantini from the Muséum National d’Histoire Naturelle, Paris, France. Viruses are a significant ecological concern because they are responsible for a variety of pathological effects in wildlife. This photograph is of a magnificent frigatebird (<em>Fregata magnificens</em>) chick, suffering from a viral infection from which, unfortunately,  it isn’t likely to recover.</p>
<h2><strong>Runner up:</strong></h2>
<figure class="wp-caption alignnone" id="attachment_12057" style="width: 592px;"><img alt="" class=" wp-image-12057" height="388" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2020/07/Forest-green-lizard-2-300x200.jpg" width="582" /><div class="attachment-image--caption">Attribution: S S Suresh.</div><div class="attachment-image--source"></div></figure>
<p>Our runner up, in sharp contrast to our overall winner, is an image showcasing the vibrant colors of a forest green lizard (<em>Calotes calotes</em>). Dr S S Suresh from the Ibri Regional Referral Hospital in Oman captured this stunning photograph after spotting a pair of the iguanian lizards in their breeding plumage.</p>
<h2><strong>Behavioral and Physiological Ecology</strong></h2>
<figure class="wp-caption alignnone" id="attachment_12058" style="width: 457px;"><img alt="" class=" wp-image-12058" height="671" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2020/07/zombie-fungus-2-200x300.jpeg" width="447" /><div class="attachment-image--caption">Attribution: Damien Esquerré</div><div class="attachment-image--source"></div></figure>
<p>Our winner in this category, taken by Damien Esquerré from the Australian National University, is entitled “Zombie fungus” and with good reason. The unfortunate weevil shown has been infected by Cordyceps, a fungus that infects insects, controls their behavior and then kills them.</p>
<h2><strong>Community, population and macro-ecology</strong></h2>
<figure class="wp-caption alignnone" id="attachment_12059" style="width: 555px;"><img alt="" class=" wp-image-12059" height="363" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2020/07/ghost-crab-2-300x200.jpg" width="545" /><div class="attachment-image--caption">Attribution: HaoYun Zhuang</div><div class="attachment-image--source"></div></figure>
<p>This delightful winning image was captured  by HaoYun Zhuang from Fuzhou University. This is a ghost crab, hiding in a human footprint on a beach in China. These animals are usually pale in color, blending into the sand, and can move very quickly to escape from predators.</p>

<p>During adulthood, roughly from 18 to 65 years, we pass through several life phases, with every life phase having specific behaviors and goals that are normative for that phase. Being in your twenties or early thirties, for instance, means that you might have to have an active, blossoming social life and be preparing for your dream job. Moreover, during your mid-thirties and your forties, you might be trying hard to balance your career, the upbringing of your children and the care for aging parents. After reaching the age of 50, the importance of and focus on your career might decrease, while the time with your loved ones will become more important.</p>
<blockquote><p>In general, if a person cannot meet his or her age-normative behaviors and goals, they may perceive loneliness.</p></blockquote>
<p>In general, if a person cannot meet his or her age-normative behaviors and goals, they may perceive loneliness. One could expect that if the behaviors and goals differ per life phase, the factors associated with loneliness might follow the same pattern.</p>
<p>To explore whether the factors associated with loneliness change as people age, we used data from a large regional health survey, the Adult Health Monitor. Participants of this survey were asked about their subjective feelings of loneliness, demographic factors, social and health-related factors. Differences between three groups, young adults (19-34), early middle-aged adults (35-49) and late middle-aged adults (50-65), were analyzed.</p>
<p><strong>The study</strong></p>
<p>In line with what we expected, we found that some of the factors associated with loneliness differ for the various life phases. Firstly, for young adults a stronger association between frequency of contact with friends and lower levels of loneliness was observed, compared to early and late middle-aged adults. This is exactly what was expected as, in your twenties, friends are some of the most important people in your life. Secondly, having a job was associated with lower levels of loneliness only for early middle-aged adults, which links to the career ambitions people might have at this age. For late middle-aged adults, those who were married experienced lower levels of loneliness. Again, we expected to find this, considering that emotional closeness increases with age.</p>
<blockquote><p>Some factors associated with loneliness were not influenced by age, such as social exclusion and perceiving psychological distress.</p></blockquote>
<p>In addition, our study has demonstrated that some factors associated with loneliness were not influenced by age, such as social exclusion and perceiving psychological distress. Remarkably, most of these factors are indicators for psychological health. This seems to demonstrate that psychological problems are associated with loneliness, no matter what age you are.</p>
<p>Particularly during the current COVID-19 pandemic, psychological health may be threatened. And on top of that, COVID-19 impacts adults differently according to the important factors of their life phase as well. For example, young adults are not able to interact with their friends or classmates face to face anymore. Early middle-aged adults have to work from home, while supervising their children and worrying about their aging parents, whereas for late middle-aged adults visiting their loved ones has become impossible.</p>
<p>So, whatever age you are, the risk of loneliness is always there, lurking in the background. And maybe now more than ever.</p>
<p><strong>The best way to deal with loneliness</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>There is no ‘one-size-fits-all’ approach to prevent or combat loneliness</p></blockquote>
<p>If the factors associated with loneliness change when people age, then what are the implications for combatting loneliness? Currently, most interventions have limited effects and are largely universal and focused on all adults, without making distinctions between young adults and late middle-aged adults. The results of our study suggest that there is no ‘one-size-fits-all’ approach to prevent or combat loneliness, but that approaches tailored to age and life phase might be advisable.</p>

<p>For nearly 30 years, <a href="https://arxiv.org/">arXiv</a> has served the public and research communities by providing open access to scholarly articles, from the vast branches of physics to the many subdisciplines of computer science to everything in between, including math, statistics, electrical engineering, quantitative biology, and economics.</p>
<p>The sheer number of arXiv research papers is both beneficial and challenging. Whether it’s a graduate student ramping up in her respective field, an established professor delving into adjacent ones, or researchers searching for big picture insights for the public good, this rich corpus of information offers significant, but sometimes overwhelming, depth.</p>
<p>To help make the arXiv more accessible, <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/Cornell-University/arxiv">we present a free, open pipeline on Kaggle to the machine-readable arXiv dataset: a repository of 1.7 million articles</a>, with relevant features such as article titles, authors, categories, abstracts, full text PDFs, and more.</p>
<p>“Having the entire arXiv corpus on Kaggle grows the potential of arXiv articles immensely,” said Eleonora Presani, arXiv Executive Director. “By offering the dataset on Kaggle we go beyond what humans can learn by reading all these articles and we make the data and information behind arXiv available to the public in a machine-readable format.”</p>
<p>Kaggle is a destination for data scientists and machine learning engineers seeking interesting datasets, public notebooks, and competitions. Researchers can utilize Kaggle’s extensive data exploration tools and easily share their relevant scripts and output with others.</p>
<p>“arXiv is more than a repository of articles, it’s a platform for knowledge sharing,” said Presani. “This requires constant innovation on how we present and interpret the knowledge we make available. Kaggle users can help push the limits of this innovation and it can be a new outlet for our community to collaborate.”</p>
<p>“With large data sets, there is generally an expectation that there are likely to be overlooked discoveries, connections, innovative tools or perspectives, which may lead to additional insights, not just in the original subject, but across other fields of study, enabling yet more discovery and innovation,” said Steinn Sigurdsson, arXiv Scientific Director.</p>
<p><b>Call to Action</b></p>
<p>Our hope is to empower new use cases that can lead to the exploration of richer machine learning techniques that combine multi-modal features towards applications like trend analysis, paper recommender engines, category prediction, co-citation networks, knowledge graph construction, and semantic search interfaces.</p>
<p>An example of such a semantic search application built on top of a specific corpus would be <a href="https://ai.googleblog.com/2020/05/an-nlu-powered-tool-to-explore-covid-19.html">Google’s COVID-19 Research Explorer</a>, a tool that helps researchers pore through the <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/allen-institute-for-ai/CORD-19-research-challenge">CORD-19 dataset</a> – a repository of 190,000+ science articles on COVID-19. Interfaces built on datasets such as this leverage advanced NLU techniques to understand a user’s <i>intent</i> behind a query. Ultimately, this can enable more efficient research by surfacing relevant data and evidence to complex, scientific questions. We hope the release of the machine-readable arXiv dataset will inspire the creation of similar NLU tools over this new corpus.</p>
<p>Alex Alemi, Senior Research Scientist at Google, has also pursued more exciting applications of ML using the arXiv. As described in the paper, <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1905.00075.pdf"><i>On the Use of arXiv as a Dataset</i></a> , Alex and his colleagues sought to propel the arXiv as a benchmark for large scale, multi-relational tasks, such as with graph neural networks.  “I’m excited to see the research community rise to the challenge of a rich, multifaceted dataset with so much real-world practicality, and the new questions this will raise,” says Alex.</p>
<p><b>Access</b></p>
<p><a href="https://www.kaggle.com/Cornell-University/arxiv">The dataset is now available on Kaggle</a> and will be updated weekly. Please send us your feedback and stay tuned for additional updates!</p>
