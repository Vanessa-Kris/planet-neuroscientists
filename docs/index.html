              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/dwarf-galaxy-m81-astronomy-space">Seven newfound dwarf galaxies sit on just one side of a larger galaxy</a></h4>

              
                <p><strong>PASADENA, Calif.</strong> — The faint dwarf galaxies in a nearby galaxy group seem to have missed the memo. Instead of being dispersed evenly around the group’s most massive galaxy, which is what happens in our own galaxy group, these newly found dwarfs cluster in one region. And astronomers don’t know why.</p>



<p>“This satellite distribution is just weird,” astronomer Eric Bell said June 13 at the American Astronomical Society meeting.</p>



<p>Bell, of the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor, and colleagues used the Subaru telescope in Hawaii to hunt for faint clumps of stars, indicating dwarf galaxies, around the galaxy M81. This Milky Way–like galaxy is the most prominent member in a relatively nearby group of galaxies, all about 12 million light-years from Earth. The team found one definite dwarf galaxy and six possible fainter ones.</p>

<p>“The part that’s just bananas,” Bell said, is that the newfound satellite galaxies all sit on one side of M81.</p>



<p>Computer simulations of galaxy evolution suggest that the largest galaxies have many faint, small galaxies sprinkled uniformly throughout the outer part of the dominant galaxy’s diffuse cloudlike halo. Observations in our galaxy group back this up: The <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/many-nine-new-dwarf-galaxies-found-outside-milky-way">dozens of dwarf galaxies</a> known to <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/eight-more-galaxies-found-orbiting-milky-way">orbit in the Milky Way</a>’s outskirts are distributed evenly around the galaxy, as are most of the dwarf galaxies seen around our nearest large neighbor, the Andromeda Galaxy (<em>SN: 3/11/15</em>; <em>SN: 8/19/15</em>).</p>



<p>But in the M81 group, the seven newly identified star clumps appear to surround a smaller member of that group, NGC 3077, which is about one-tenth the mass of M81. “The fact that the bigger thing doesn’t have more satellites,” Bell says, “nobody expects that.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/wildfire-health-risks-air-smoke-west-east-united-states">Western wildfires’ health risks extend across the country</a></h4>

              
                <p>After a relaxing day at the Jersey Shore last July, Jessica Reeder and her son and daughter headed back home to Philadelphia. As they crested a bridge from New Jersey into Pennsylvania, they were greeted with a hazy, yellow-gray sky. It reminded Reeder of the smoky skies she saw growing up in Southern California on days when fires burned in the dry canyons.</p>



<p>Smelling smoke and worried about her asthma and her kids, Reeder flipped the switch to recirculate the air inside the car instead of drawing from the outside. At home, the family closed all the windows and turned their air purifiers on high.</p>





<p>The smoke had traveled from fires raging on the other side of the continent, in the western United States and Canada. Although air quality in Philadelphia didn’t come close to the record-bad air quality that some western cities experienced, it was bad enough to trigger air quality warnings — and not just for people with asthma or heart problems.</p>



<p>Most large U.S. wildfires occur in the West. But the smoke doesn’t stay there. It travels eastward, affecting communities hundreds to thousands of kilometers away from the fires. In fact, the majority of <a href="https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/2021GH000457">asthma-related deaths and emergency room visits attributed to fire smoke</a> in the United States occur in eastern cities, according to a study in the September 2021 <em>GeoHealth</em>.</p>

<p>The big problem is fine particulate matter, tiny particles also known as PM<sub>2.5</sub>. These bits of ash, gases and other detritus suspended in smoke are no more than 2.5 micrometers wide, small enough to lodge in the lungs and cause permanent damage. PM<sub>2.5</sub> exacerbates respiratory and cardiovascular problems and can lead to premature death. The particles can also <a href="https://www.epa.gov/sciencematters/links-between-air-pollution-and-childhood-asthma">cause asthma and other chronic conditions in otherwise healthy adults and children</a>.</p>



<p>Over the last few decades, U.S. clean air regulations have cut down on particulate matter from industrial pollution, so the air has been getting cleaner, especially in the populous eastern cities. But the regulations don’t address particulate matter from wildfire smoke, which recent studies show is chemically different from industrial air pollution, potentially more hazardous to humans and increasing significantly.</p>



<p>So far, a lot of the research on how wildfire PM<sub>2.5</sub> can make people sick has been based on people living or working near fires in the West. Now, researchers are turning their attention to how PM<sub>2.5</sub> from smoke affects the big population centers in the East, far from the wildfires. One thing is clear: With the <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/climate-change-wildfires-heat-waves-hurricanes-records-2020">intensity and frequency of wildfires increasing</a> due to climate change (<em>SN: 12/19/20 &amp; 1/2/21, p. 32</em>), people across North America need to be concerned about the health impacts, says Katelyn O’Dell, an atmospheric scientist at George Washington University in Washington, D.C.</p>





<h4>Bad air travels</h4>



<p>Air pollution regulations limit PM<sub>2.5</sub> from exhaust-emitting cars and trucks and fossil fuel–burning factories and power plants. These regulations have done “a really good job” reducing anthropogenic air pollution in the last couple of decades, says Rosana Aguilera, an environmental scientist at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography in La Jolla, Calif. In the United States, concentrations of six of the most common air pollutants have <a href="https://gispub.epa.gov/air/trendsreport/2021/#home">dropped by 78 percent</a> since the Clean Air Act of 1970, according to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. PM<sub>2.5</sub> concentrations have come down as well — at least until recently.</p>



<p>Western wildfires, which are growing more frequent, more severe and larger, are erasing some of the gains made in reducing industrial pollution, says Rebecca Buchholz, an atmospheric chemist at the National Center for Atmospheric Research in Boulder, Colo.</p>



<p>Fires in the Pacific Northwest are <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-022-29623-8">“driving an upward trend” in particulate matter air pollution</a>, Buchholz and colleagues wrote April 19 in <em>Nature Communications</em>. Such smoke pollution peaks in August when fires in the region tend to spike and the atmosphere’s ability to clean itself through, say, rain, is limited. This spike of late-summer air pollution is new, Buchholz says. It’s especially noticeable since 2012.</p>

<p>And, as Reeder and her family experienced last year, transported wildfire pollution is causing substantial particulate matter spikes in the central United States and northeastern North America, Buchholz and colleagues found. Pacific Northwest wildfires thus “have the potential to impact surface air quality, even at large distances downwind of the wildfires,” the team wrote, putting some 23 million people in the central United States and 72 million in northeastern North America at increased risk of health impacts from the imported wildfire smoke.</p>



<p>How far and where PM<sub>2.5</sub> travels depends on weather patterns and how high wildfire smoke reaches — the stronger the fire, the longer it can last and the farther smoke can go, and thus the farther particulate matter can reach. Last year, far-away wildfires created unhealthy air quality conditions in locations from the Great Plains to New York City and Washington, D.C.</p>



<p>New York City saw some of its worst air quality in two decades. Philadelphia had two “code red” days — meaning air quality was unhealthy for all — because of the U.S. West and Canadian fires. In 2019, 2020 and 2021, those fires pushed PM<sub>2.5</sub> to unhealthy levels in much of Minnesota. In fact, a 2018 study showed that <a href="https://acp.copernicus.org/articles/18/1745/2018/">wildfire smoke plumes now waft above Minnesota for eight to 12 days per month</a> between June and September.</p>



<div class="wp-block-sciencenews-content-sidebar alignwide">
<h3>Air safety yardstick</h3>

<h4>Human impacts</h4>



<p>Smoke in the West is already having a tangible effect on human health in the East, says O’Dell, lead author of the 2021 <em>GeoHealth</em> study.</p>



<p>Reviewing smoke and health data from 2006 to 2018, O’Dell and colleagues found that more people visit emergency rooms and are hospitalized in the East than in the West from asthma problems attributable to smoke PM<sub>2.5</sub>. Asthma-related ER visits and hospitalizations were higher east of the Rockies in 11 of the 13 years.</p>



<p>Over the study period, an average of 74 percent of asthma-related deaths and 75 percent of asthma ER visits and hospitalizations attributable to smoke occurred east of the Rockies. Of the estimated 6,300 excess deaths from asthma complications due to smoke PM<sub>2.5</sub> that occurred annually over the study period, more than 4,600 were in the East.</p>



<p>Smoke affects so many more people in the East primarily because more people live there, O’Dell notes. Her team defined “West” as west of the Rockies, with a population of 64 million, and “East” as east of the Rockies, home to 226 million people. In the West, smoke PM<sub>2.5</sub> causes a higher portion of regional asthma deaths. In the East, it’s a lower portion of the total population, but a far higher total number of people affected.</p>



<p>“We may be already seeing the consequences of these fires on the health of residents who live hundreds or even thousands of miles downwind,” Buchholz said in a press release.</p>

<h3>August peaks</h3>



<p>Although aerosols, including fine particulate matter, from Pacific Northwest fires have been increasing since 2002, they began a sharp increase in 2012, spiking in the warm, dry summer months. As smoke from the Northwest wafted eastward, similar smaller spikes were seen in the central United States and northeastern North America. </p>

<h4>Vulnerable youth</h4>



<p>“Asthma is a very widespread, common health condition,” says Yang Liu, an environmental scientist at Emory University in Atlanta. In the United States, about 25 million people have asthma, or 8 percent of adults and 7 percent of children, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.</p>



<p>Fine particulate matter can spark asthma attacks, but it can also be a danger to people without the condition. Children are especially vulnerable primarily because of physiology. Children breathe faster so they end up taking in more particulate matter, plus their lungs are smaller so more of their lung surface is likely to be damaged when they breathe in particulate matter. And their lungs are still developing, says Jennifer Stowell, an environmental epidemiologist at Boston University School of Public Health.</p>



<p>Stowell led a study, reported in the January <em>Environmental Research Letters</em>, <a href="https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/ac4138">estimating how much wildfire smoke will exacerbate asthma attacks in the West</a>. Stowell, Liu and colleagues estimate that, in the 2050s, there will be an additional 155,000 asthma-related ER visits and hospitalizations per wildfire season in the West just from smoke PM<sub>2.5</sub>. The biggest concern, Stowell says, is for children and younger adults.</p>



<p>Aguilera, of Scripps, and her colleagues found associations between wildfire-specific PM<sub>2.5</sub> and pediatric respiratory-related ER and urgent care visits. In San Diego County from 2011 to 2017, <a href="https://publications.aap.org/pediatrics/article/147/4/e2020027128/180791/Fine-Particles-in-Wildfire-Smoke-and-Pediatric">wildfire-specific PM<sub>2.5</sub> was 10 times as harmful to respiratory health</a> in children 5 and younger as ambient PM<sub>2.5</sub>, the researchers reported in 2021 in <em>Pediatrics</em>. In fact, the same increase in levels of PM<sub>2.5</sub> from smoke versus ambient sources caused a 26 percent higher rate of ER or urgent care visits. The researchers didn’t note whether the children had preexisting asthma.</p>



<p>And even when a <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31860802/">wildfire increased PM<sub>2.5</sub> by a small amount</a>, respiratory ER and urgent care visits in kids 12 and under increased, Aguilera and colleagues reported in 2020 in the <em>Annals of the American Thoracic Society</em>. “Even relatively smaller wildfires can still generate quite an impact on the pediatric population,” Aguilera says. “And really, any amount of PM or air pollution is harmful.”</p>



<p>Studies of nonhuman primates have also shown permanent effects of smoke on the young — results researchers expect would also apply to humans, given genetic similarities. In 2008, a group of infant rhesus macaques at the California National Primate Research Center at the University of California, Davis was exposed to high PM<sub>2.5</sub> levels from a series of devastating wildfires in Northern California. Researchers have been comparing those monkeys with macaques born a year later that weren’t exposed to smoke.</p>

<p>At around age 3, <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28208028/">macaques exposed to smoke displayed immune disorders</a> and reduced lung capacity, lung function and lung volume, says Hong Ji, a molecular biologist at UC Davis and the primate center who wasn’t involved with this study. The lungs look like they had fibrosis, Ji says. “Early life smoke exposure &#8230; changed the trajectory of lung development,” and it doesn’t appear to be reversible, she says.</p>



<p>The monkeys exposed to wildfire PM<sub>2.5</sub> also <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0160412021006188?via%3Dihub">have important changes to how their DNA works</a>, Ji and colleagues reported in the January <em>Environment International</em>. Exposure to wildfire smoke in infancy can cause life-altering, long-term changes to the monkeys’ nervous and immune systems, as well as brain development, Ji says. Even worse, she says, the DNA changes are the type that can be passed down and may result in generational damage.</p>



<p>Even <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-022-29436-9">macaques born after in utero exposure to wildfire smoke can suffer cognitive, immune and hormone problems</a>, primate center researchers reported April 1 in <em>Nature Communications</em>.</p>



<p>Now, Ji and colleagues have teamed with Rebecca Schmidt, a molecular epidemiologist at UC Davis who’s leading a study on the effects of wildfire smoke exposure on pregnant women and young children. This research group, as well as other teams, is also looking into whether PM<sub>2.5</sub> is causing genetic changes to babies exposed to smoke in utero, Ji says. The more results gathered on the effects of wildfire PM<sub>2.5</sub> on babies and children — and even in pregnancy — the more dangerous we realize it is, Ji says.</p>



<h4>Chemical differences</h4>



<p>Particulate matter changes as it travels through the atmosphere, both in volume and in chemistry. Some PM<sub>2.5</sub> is emitted directly from fires, and some is born from chemicals and trace gases emitted from fires that get chemically processed in the atmosphere, Buchholz says. Reactions that happen in the smoke plume, combined with sunlight, can create even more PM<sub>2.5</sub> downwind of the fires. How these particulates change chemically — through interactions between the atmosphere and the particulate matter, and between fire pollution and human pollution — and what that means for human health “is a really active area of research right now,” she says. “It’s super complicated.”</p>



<p>Epidemiological and atmospheric chemistry studies indicate that wildfire PM<sub>2.5</sub> is more hazardous to human health than ambient PM<sub>2.5</sub>, says Stowell, the Boston epidemiologist. One such study compared particulate matter from Amazonian fires with urban sources such as vehicle exhaust in Atlanta. Nga Lee Ng, an atmospheric chemist at Georgia Tech, and colleagues found that <a href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.estlett.9b00060">smoke particulate matter is more toxic than urban particulate matter</a>, “inducing about five times higher cellular oxidative stress,” Ng says. Oxidative stress damages cells and DNA in the body.</p>



<p>In addition, as smoke travels through the atmosphere and ages, it seems to become even more toxic, Ng says. Reactions between the particulate matter and sunlight and atmospheric gases change the particulate matter’s chemical and physical properties, rendering it even more potentially harmful. So, even though particulate matter dissipates over time and distance, “the health effects per gram are greater,” says Daniel Jaffe, an atmospheric chemist at the University of Washington Bothell.</p>



<p>That means that the studies of health effects near wildfires in the West may not represent the full story of how smoke from distant fires affects people in the East.</p>



<p>Liu, at Emory, hopes to see the U.S. government revisit policies related to what PM<sub>2.5</sub> levels are dangerous, since they’re based on ambient and not wildfire-related PM<sub>2.5</sub>. In March, an EPA advisory panel recommended just that. <a href="https://www.lawandenvironment.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2022/03/casac-review-of-the-epas-policy-assessment-for-the-reconsideration-of-the-national-ambient-air-quality-standards-for-particulate-matter-external-review-draft-october-2021.pdf">In a letter to the agency</a>, the Clean Air Scientific Advisory Committee wrote: “Regarding the annual PM<sub>2.5</sub> standard, all CASAC members agree that the current level of the annual standard is not sufficiently protective of public health and should be lowered.” The committee added, “There is substantial epidemiologic evidence from both morbidity and mortality studies that the current standard is not adequately protective.”</p>



<p>Local communities throughout the country need to determine when to close schools or at least keep kids inside, Liu says, as well as when to advise people to close windows and turn on air purifiers. Good masks — N95 and KN95 — can help too (yes, masks that block viruses can also block particulate matter).</p>



<p>City, county and state governments also need to prepare the health care system to respond to increased asthma issues, Liu says. Some states are starting to respond. In 2017, for example, the Minnesota Pollution Control Agency increased its air quality monitoring stations around the state from two to 18. The agency is also working with the National Weather Service, the Minnesota Department of Health and the Minnesota Department of Transportation to better communicate air quality warnings.</p>

<p>In the meantime, much more research is needed into the human health implications of increasing wildfire smoke, Buchholz says, as well as the chemical interactions in the atmosphere, how climate is changing fires, how fires change year after year, and how they impact the atmosphere, not to mention how different trees, buildings and other fuels affect particulate matter.</p>



<p>“Wildfires are perhaps one of the most visible ways that [climate change] is linked to health,” Stowell says. And the reality is, she says, “we’re going to see it remain as bad or worse for a while.”</p>



<div class="wp-block-sciencenews-content-sidebar">
<h4>Smoke gets on the brain</h4>



<p>Health impact studies of air pollution, including wildfire smoke, have mostly focused on the lungs. But toxicologist Matthew Campen of the University of New Mexico in Albuquerque is looking at the brain.</p>



<p>In a study of the inflammatory effects of smoke PM<sub>2.5</sub> on the brains of mice, Campen and colleagues found that inflammation in the lungs was modest compared with the “profound” inflammation in the brain, Campen says. Given what’s known about how damaging smoke can be in the lungs, to find even greater effects on the brain is troubling, he says.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/covid-19-vaccine-kids-babies-under-5-fda-united-states">Pfizer’s and Moderna’s COVID-19 vaccines are OK’d for the youngest kids</a></h4>

              
                <p>The littlest kids in the United States are done waiting for their own COVID-19 vaccine.</p>



<p>On June 18, an advisory committee to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention unanimously recommended Moderna’s and Pfizer-BioNTech’s mRNA vaccines for babies, toddlers and preschoolers. CDC director Rochelle Walensky endorsed that recommendation hours later. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration had<a href="https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/coronavirus-covid-19-update-fda-authorizes-moderna-and-pfizer-biontech-covid-19-vaccines-children"> granted emergency use authorization</a> of the vaccines on June 17, two days after the FDA’s advisory committee had voted unanimously in favor of the authorization.</p>





<p>The recommendation — a relief to many families of young children who&#8217;ve endured multiple COVID-19 surges, restricted outings and daycare disruptions — comes two and a half years after<a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/covid-19-coronavirus-moderna-vaccine-fda-approval"> adults were first vaccinated</a> against COVID-19 in December 2020 (<em>SN: 12/18/20</em>). This young age group consists of approximately 18.7 million children.</p>



<p>“This recommendation does fill a significant unmet need for a really ignored younger population,” said FDA committee member Michael Nelson, an allergist and immunologist at the University of Virginia School of Medicine in Charlottesville. He hopes every child in the United States “gets vaccinated in the near future.”</p>



<p>The first shots for the littlest kids could be available as early as June 21. According to<a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2022/06/09/fact-sheetbiden-administration-announces-operational-plan-for-covid-19-vaccinations-for-children-under-5/"> plans released by the Biden administration</a>, an initial 10 million doses for young children will come first, with millions more arriving in the following weeks. Families will be able to get the shots at pediatrician offices, community health centers, public health clinics, children’s hospitals and pharmacies, among other locations. The goal is that 85 percent of kids under 5 will be within 5 miles of a vaccination site.</p>



<p>The FDA and CDC advisory committee meetings were a reminder yet again that the youngest are not free of risk from COVID-19. Among children, those 0 to 4 years old have the highest number of deaths compared with those who are older:<a href="https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#demographics"> &nbsp;485 kids ages 0 to 4 have died</a>, topping the 366, 384 and 311 reported in the 5–11, 12–15 and 16–17 year age groups, respectively, according to the CDC’s COVID Data Tracker as of June 17.</p>



<p>From March 2020 through April 2022, COVID-19 was the <a href="https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.05.23.22275458v2">fourth leading cause of death for children under 1 year old and the fifth leading cause for kids ages 1 through 4</a>. COVID-19 is the only infectious disease among the top five. The burden of deaths from COVID-19 is similar to or greater than that of other pediatric vaccine-preventable diseases, said Sara Oliver, a medical officer with the CDC’s National Center for Immunizations and Respiratory Diseases, during a presentation at CDC’s advisory committee meeting.</p>



<p>The winter<a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/covid-coronavirus-omicron-variant-mutation-infectious"> surge driven by the omicron variant</a> of the coronavirus was especially hard on the littlest kids (<em>SN: 3/1/22</em>). For children under 5, there were<a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/71/wr/mm7111e2.htm"> 14.5 hospitalizations per 100,000</a> children in the United States during the peak of omicron, a rate five times as high as that seen during the delta variant’s peak, researchers reported in March in the <em>Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report</em>.</p>



<p>Roughly 1 in 4 children under 5 hospitalized with COVID-19 end up in the intensive care unit, said pediatrician Evan Anderson of Emory University School of Medicine in Atlanta during a presentation at the FDA’s advisory committee meeting. “Having cared for many children that have been in the ICU on ventilators for COVID … and having cared for several children that have died of COVID, we need to be able to prevent COVID-19,” Anderson said.</p>



<p>The seriousness of the illness means that “prevention is really the way to go,” said FDA committee member and pediatric infectious disease specialist Hayley Gans of Stanford University School of Medicine. The COVID-19 vaccine is “a breakthrough that has allowed us to move through the pandemic … [with] less suffering and disease.”</p>



<p>The benefits of vaccination also extend to young children with a prior COVID-19 infection, Oliver said during the CDC’s advisory committee meeting. An estimated 71 percent of 6 month to 4-year-olds in the United States have evidence of a past bout of COVID-19 as of this spring. But the protection from infection-induced antibodies is not as robust as that from antibodies produced after COVID-19 vaccination, research has found. In children and adolescents, those <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-022-30649-1">vaccinated twice had higher levels of virus-blocking antibodies</a> against different coronavirus variants, including omicron, than did those who only had a SARS-CoV-2 infection, researchers reported in May in <em>Nature Communications</em>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Vaccination against COVID-19 even in those previously infected is still important to help protect against future infections and prevent severe disease, Oliver said.</p>



<p>At both advisory committee meetings, members reviewed immunity and safety data for&nbsp; Moderna’s and Pfizer’s shots for the youngest children. The two vaccines have different dosing and timelines. Moderna’s mRNA COVID-19 vaccine for kids 6 months through 5 years is a two-dose series, 25 micrograms per dose, given four weeks apart. (Adults get two 100 microgram doses for their initial two-dose series of shots.)&nbsp;</p>



<p>Pfizer’s option, for kids 6 months through 4 years, is a three-dose series with 3 micrograms per dose. The first two shots are given three weeks apart, followed by a third dose at least eight weeks later. (The initial two-shot series for adults consists of 30-microgram doses.) Younger<a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coronavirus-covid-19-vaccines-children-kids-teens-ready-summer"> kids tend to get smaller doses</a> of vaccines because of the need to balance their robust response to the shots with keeping expected side effects, like fever, manageable (<em>SN: 2/25/21</em>).</p>



<p>Determining how well a vaccine is expected to work in children is tested differently than in adults. The adult COVID-19 vaccine trials included tens of thousands of people per trial, enough to<a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coronavirus-what-does-covid-19-vaccine-efficacy-mean"> determine the efficacy of the vaccines</a> (<em>SN: 10/4/20</em>). That’s a measure of how well the shots protect those in the vaccinated group compared with those given a placebo, based on how many cases occur in each group. For kids, it would have taken even larger trials to have enough COVID-19 cases (since overall totals among kids have been lower than for adults) for a close read on efficacy.</p>



<p>So as a proxy for efficacy, the trials compared the antibody response kids generate to the shots with what was measured for the youngest adults in the efficacy trials. For Moderna, the comparison group is 18- to 25-year-olds, while for Pfizer, the response is matched against those 16 to 25 years old (Pfizer included older teens in their adult trial).</p>



<p>Among more than 6,600 participants, Moderna reported that the little kids’ antibody response to its two-dose series met that seen among the young adult comparison group. Pfizer reported the same for the more than 4,500 participants in its young kids’ trial: the three-dose series produced antibody levels that reached that seen among the 16- to 25-year-old comparison group, which had gotten two shots.</p>



<p>The advisory committee also reviewed the safety of the vaccines for little kids. There were no alarming allergic reactions to the shots, no deaths and no cases of heart inflammation,<a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/covid-coronavirus-mrna-vaccines-heart-inflammation-myocarditis"> a very rare side effect</a> of COVID-19 mRNA vaccines (<em>SN: 6/23/21</em>) that poses a<a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/71/wr/mm7114e1.htm?s_cid=mm7114e1_w"> much higher risk during COVID-19 illness</a>. Common side effects for both vaccines included sore arms, crying, irritability, sleepiness and fever. It’s fine to give pain relievers after vaccination for children with fever or soreness, Oliver said at the CDC’s advisory committee meeting.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Once the vaccines get the go-ahead,<a href="https://www.kff.org/coronavirus-covid-19/poll-finding/kff-covid-19-vaccine-monitor-april-2022/"> close to 20 percent of parents of the very young plan to be in line right away</a>, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation’s COVID-19 Vaccine Monitor. The survey from mid-April reported that another 38 percent plan to wait and see how things go with the vaccine rollout before deciding, while 11 percent say they will get their youngest immunized only if the shots are required. That leaves 27 percent in the “definitely not” category, which is similar to the percentage of parents who say they won’t vaccinate kids 5 and up.</p>



<p>An issue that remains is whether the littlest kids will need boosters added to the initial series of shots, as adults and older kids have. For immunocompromised children, a third dose of Moderna would be included in the initial series of shots, based on data for older children and adults who are immunocompromised and were vaccinated with Moderna. There isn’t yet data on whether another dose should be added for the Pfizer series of three shots for young children who are immunocompromised. </p>



<p>Safety monitoring for COVID-19 vaccines will also continue, through different U.S. surveillance systems such as the<a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccinesafety/ensuringsafety/monitoring/vaers/index.html"> Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System</a>. So far, around 600 million doses of the COVID-19 vaccines have been given in the United States, and the safety demonstrated is reassuring, said FDA committee member Henry Bernstein, a pediatrician at Cohen Children’s Medical Center in New Hyde Park, N.Y. “I think having a COVID vaccine available for this younger population is critically important, given that pediatric cases can be, [have] been and may be problematic in the future.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/kangaroo-island-dunnart-marsupial-extinction-feral-cats-wildfires">These tiny marsupials survived wildfires only to face extinction from feral cats</a></h4>

              
                <p>Few marsupials have gone from miraculous survival to the brink of extinction as quickly as the Kangaroo Island dunnart.</p>



<p>In 2019 and 2020, devastating fires burned nearly 10 million hectares of southeastern Australia. The flames threatened hundreds of species with extinction, but the Kangaroo Island dunnart (<em>Sminthopsis aitkeni</em>) — which already numbered less than 500 before the fires — seemed to be <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/australia-wildfires-extinction-threat-species-one-year-later">one that defied expectations</a> in the aftermath (<em>SN: 3/9/21).</em></p>



<p>But now these rare creatures <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-022-11383-6">may be more at risk than ever</a>, researchers say June 16 in <em>Scientific Reports</em>. The danger, as domestic as it sounds, is getting eaten by a cat.</p>





<p>As of 2008, invasive <a href="https://abcbirds.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Medina_et_al_2011-Global_review_of_invasive_cat_impacts_on_endangered_vertebrates.pdf">feral cats had contributed to at least 13 percent of extinctions worldwide</a>. That&#8217;s one reason the government has been euthanizing cats on Kangaroo Island for years. The scientists who conducted the dunnart study knew all this — but when they studied the remains of cats euthanized in 2020, they were still surprised by what they saw: Seven out of 86 cats had recently dined on dunnart.</p>



<p>“We were not expecting to find so many,” says Louis Lignereux, a field researcher at the University of Adelaide School of Animal and Veterinary Science. It’s particularly bad news, he says, if you think of what was in the cats as only a snapshot of what they ate in the last 36 hours. Taking that into account, those seven cats alone could have eaten enough to wipe out the Kangaroo Island dunnart within a few months, if they had survived — and there are hundreds of other cats on the island.</p>



<p>A small habitat makes the dunnarts especially vulnerable. It’s like putting all your eggs in one basket, Lignereux says. Since <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/australian-fires-incinerated-habitats-threatened-species-ecological-disaster">the fires</a>, the Kangaroo Island dunnart is thought to now live in an area about one-tenth of the size of Manhattan <em>(SN: 1/13/20)</em>.</p>



<p>“If something happened to this spot,” he says, “then [the dunnart] is gone forever.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/polar-bear-greeland-sea-ice-glacial-melange-climate-change">Some polar bears in Greenland survive on surprisingly little sea ice</a></h4>

              
                <p>“Pihoqahiak” means “ever-wandering one,” and is an Inuit name for the polar bear, a creature known to roam vast expanses of sea ice, sometimes plodding thousands of kilometers a year in search of seals.</p>



<p>But along the fjord-cut coastline of southeast Greenland, where the sea freezes over for just a few months of the year, some isolated polar bears are surviving as homebodies.</p>



<p>Unlike most polar bears, these bears don’t follow the sea ice during its annual recession or move onto land to hunt. Instead, the crafty ursids <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.abq5267">stalk seals on nearby glacial mélange</a> — a floating mishmash of icebergs, sea ice fragments and snow that persists year-round near the front of glaciers in the fjords, researchers report in the June 17 <em>Science</em>.</p>





<p>“They’re residents in fjords that are sea ice–free for more than eight months of the year,” says Kristin Laidre, a biologist at the University of Washington in Seattle. “Normally, a polar bear wouldn&#8217;t be able to survive without sea ice for that long.”</p>



<p>For polar bears (<em>Ursus maritimus</em>), sea ice isn’t just frozen seawater; it’s the platform they usually use to hunt their preferred prey — seals. But as human-caused climate change raises Earth’s global temperature, <a href="https://tc.copernicus.org/articles/15/233/2021/tc-15-233-2021.html">that ice is disappearing</a>. The number of polar bears that live on sea ice in the Beaufort Sea in the Arctic Ocean and Canada’s Hudson Bay is already declining. Researchers estimate that <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41558-020-0818-9">most other subpopulations of the bears will collapse by 2100</a> unless greenhouse gas emissions are curbed. The International Union for Conservation of Nature classifies the species as “vulnerable.”</p>



<p>The fjords of southeast Greenland and similar, limited areas could become a last, temporary refuge for a small number of bears, though only curbing climate change can save the ice-dependent species, Laidre and her colleagues say. Glacial mélange isn’t widespread in the Arctic, and what exists could disappear if temperatures rise too much.</p>



<p>Laidre and her colleagues estimate that several hundred bears may dwell in the fjords of southeast Greenland, though further work is needed to obtain a more precise count.</p>



<p>The southeast Greenland group came to the researchers’ attention while they were studying polar bears along east Greenland’s coast to provide advice to the Indigenous peoples who hunt the bears for subsistence. An analysis of 83 receiver-tagged polar bears from 1993 to 2021 revealed that, for the most part, bears living south of about 64° N latitude don’t interact with bears to the north, and vice versa.</p>



<p>Southeast Greenland bears may be mostly isolated by Greenland’s ice sheet to the west and a rapid current to the east, which could sweep seafaring bears south and stifle northward movement, the researchers say.</p>



<p>In northeast Greenland, the median distance traveled by tagged bears was 40 kilometers every four days. But in the southeast region, the median distance traveled was just 10 kilometers every four days, with bears sometimes traveling between neighboring fjords and sometimes remaining in the same fjord all year.</p>



<p>“For a polar bear, that&#8217;s nothing,” says Steven Amstrup, a zoologist and chief scientist of the conservation organization Polar Bears International, based in Bozeman, Mont., who was not involved in the study. “Apparently they&#8217;re finding enough resources there that they don&#8217;t have to make these huge, big movements.”</p>



<p>Southeast Greenland bears hunted on sea ice when it was present during a few months in winter and spring, the researchers found. For the rest of the year, the ursids used the glacial mélange that packed the fjords as hunting grounds. <a></a></p>



<p>“They use it just like sea ice,” Laidre says. “They&#8217;re able to walk [and hunt] on the mélange … and they can swim around between the pieces of ice and ambush seals.”</p>

<p>It’s not entirely surprising that polar bears have settled at the fronts — or toes — of glaciers in the fjords, Amstrup says. “Oftentimes, the toes of these glaciers are very productive areas,” he says, because glacial meltwater can flush nutrients from deeper in the ocean up toward the water’s surface. “You might expect that they would have seal populations [that] could support bears.”</p>



<p>The researchers also analyzed rare genetic variations in the southeast Greenland bears. That work revealed that the sampled animals shared a common ancestor about 200 years ago and have essentially kept to themselves since. “They’re the most genetically isolated polar bears in the world,” Laidre says. Conserving the distinctive bears will be important for protecting the species’ genetic diversity, which is already low, she says.</p>



<p>But for all their peculiarity, even southeast Greenland polar bears will perish without <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/climate-action-could-save-polar-bears">human climate action</a>, Laidre and Amstrup agree (<em>SN: 12/15/10</em>). “Loss of Arctic sea ice is still the primary threat to all polar bears,” Laidre says. “This study does not change that.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/neutrino-sun-carbon-nitrogen-metals-elements">Neutrinos hint the sun has more carbon and nitrogen than previously thought</a></h4>

              
                <p>After two decades of debate, scientists are getting closer to figuring out exactly what the sun — and thus the whole universe — is made of.</p>



<p>The sun is mostly composed of hydrogen and helium. There are also heavier elements such as oxygen and carbon, but just how much is controversial. New observations of ghostly subatomic particles known as neutrinos suggest that <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.15975">the sun has an ample supply of “metals,”</a> the term astronomers use for all elements heavier than hydrogen and helium, researchers report May 31 at arXiv.org.</p>





<p>The results “are fully compatible with [a] high metallicity” for the sun, says Livia Ludhova, a physicist at Research Center Jülich in Germany.</p>



<p>Elements heavier than hydrogen and helium are crucial for creating rock-iron planets like Earth and sustaining life-forms like humans. By far the most abundant of these elements in the universe is oxygen, followed by carbon, neon and nitrogen.</p>



<p>But astronomers don’t know exactly how much of these elements exist relative to hydrogen, the most common element in the cosmos. That’s because astronomers typically use the sun as a reference point to gauge elemental abundances in other stars and galaxies, and two techniques imply very different chemical compositions for our star.</p>



<p>One technique exploits vibrations inside the sun to deduce its internal structure and favors a high metal content. The second technique determines the sun’s composition from how atoms on its surface absorb certain wavelengths of light. Two decades ago, <a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/link_gateway/2009ARA&amp;A..47..481A/doi:10.1146/annurev.astro.46.060407.145222">a use of this second technique</a> suggested that oxygen, carbon, neon and nitrogen levels in the sun were 26 to 42 percent lower than <a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/link_gateway/1989GeCoA..53..197A/doi:10.1016/0016-7037(89)90286-X">an earlier determination found</a>, creating the current conflict.</p>



<p>Another technique has now emerged that could decide the long-standing debate: using solar neutrinos.</p>



<p>These particles arise from nuclear reactions in the sun’s core that turn hydrogen into helium. About 1 percent of the sun’s energy comes from reactions involving carbon, nitrogen and oxygen, which convert hydrogen into helium but do not get used up in the process. So the more carbon, nitrogen and oxygen the sun actually has, the more neutrinos this CNO cycle should emit.</p>



<p>In 2020, scientists announced that Borexino, an underground detector in Italy, had spotted <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/neutrinos-sun-core-nuclear-fusion-reactions-borexino">these CNO neutrinos</a> (<em>SN: 6/24/20</em>). Now Ludhova and her colleagues have recorded enough neutrinos to calculate that carbon and nitrogen atoms together are about 0.06 percent as abundant as hydrogen atoms in the sun — the first use of neutrinos to determine the sun’s makeup.</p>



<p>And though that number sounds small, it’s even higher than the one favored by astronomers who support a high-metal sun. And it’s 70 percent greater than the number a low-metal sun should have.</p>



<p>“This is a great result,” says Marc Pinsonneault, an astronomer at Ohio State University in Columbus who has long advocated for a high-metal sun. “They’ve been able to demonstrate robustly that the current low-metallicity solution is inconsistent with the data.”</p>



<p>Still, because of uncertainties in both the observed and predicted neutrino numbers, Borexino can’t fully rule out a low-metal sun, Ludhova says.</p>



<p>The new work is “a significant improvement,” says Gaël Buldgen, an astrophysicist at Geneva University in Switzerland who favors a low-metal sun. But the predicted numbers of CNO neutrinos come from models of the sun that he criticizes as too simplified. Those models neglect the sun’s spin, which could induce mixing of chemical elements over its life and change the amount of carbon, nitrogen and oxygen near the sun’s center, thereby changing the predicted number of CNO neutrinos, Buldgen says.</p>



<p>Additional neutrino observations are needed for a final verdict, Ludhova says. Borexino shut down in 2021, but future experiments could fill the void.</p>



<p>The stakes are high. “We’re arguing about what the universe is made of,” Pinsonneault says, because “the sun is the benchmark for all of our studies.”</p>



<p>So if the sun has much more carbon, nitrogen and oxygen than currently thought, so does the whole universe. “That changes our understanding about how the chemical elements are made. It changes our understanding of how stars evolve and how they live and die,” Pinsonneault says. And, he adds, it&#8217;s a reminder that even the best-studied star — our sun — still has secrets.</p>

                <p>This week on Journal Club session Reinoud Maex will talk about a his paper &quot;Effect of Extracellular Volume on the Energy Stored in Transmembrane Concentration Gradients&quot;.</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>The amount of energy that can be retrieved from a concentration gradient across
a membrane separating two compartments depends on the relative size of the
compartments. Having a larger low-concentration compartment is in general
beneficial. It is shown here analytically that the retrieved energy further
increases when the high- concentration compartment shrinks during the mixing
process, and a general formula is derived for the energy when the ratio of
transported solvent to solute varies. These calculations are then applied to
the interstitial compartment of the brain, which is rich in Na+ and Cl- ions
and poor in K+. The reported shrinkage of this compartment, and swelling of the
neurons, during oxygen deprivation is shown to enhance the energy recovered
from NaCl entering the neurons. The slight loss of energy on the part of K+ can
be compensated for by the uptake of K+ ions by glial cells. In conclusion, the
present study proposes that the reported fluctuations in the size of the
interstitial compartment of the brain (expansion during sleep and contraction
during oxygen deprivation) optimize the amount of energy that neurons can store
in, and retrieve from, their ionic concentration gradients.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/pumpkin-toadlets-jump-brachycephalus">Here’s why pumpkin toadlets are such clumsy jumpers</a></h4>

              
                <p>Some frogs just can’t stick the landing.</p>



<p>After launching into a leap, pumpkin toadlets careen through the air as if flung from a toddler’s fist. They roll, cartwheel or backflip and then plummet to the ground, often belly flopping or crash-landing on their backs.</p>



<p>“I’ve looked at a lot of frogs and these are the weirdest things I’ve ever seen,” says Richard Essner, Jr., a vertebrate zoologist at Southern Illinois University Edwardsville.</p>



<p>Essner and colleagues now propose an explanation for <a href="http://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.abn1104">why the tiny frogs are such clumsy jumpers</a>. The animals lack the proper gyroscopic equipment to sense small changes in rotation, the team suggests June 15 in&nbsp;<em>Science Advances</em>.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">

</div><figcaption><em>Brachycephalus pernix</em>&nbsp;frogs have trouble sensing small changes in rotation, which makes landing jumps difficult, a new study suggests. The frogs can roll, cartwheel or backflip through the air, and then hit the ground on their backs or bellies.</figcaption></figure>



<p>When&nbsp;Essner saw videos of&nbsp;<em>Brachycephalus</em>&nbsp;frogs’ awkward aerial maneuvers, he was so shocked that he hopped on a plane to study the animals with his colleagues in Brazil. Small enough to fit on a person’s thumbnail, the frogs are tricky to find in the wild. Scientists listen for the amphibians’ high-pitched, buzzy calls and then scoop leaf litter into a bag, hoping to find a few toadlets.</p>





<p>In the lab, the team used high-speed video to record more than 100 tiny frog jumps. The klutzy tumbles suggested that the toadlets have trouble orienting themselves in space.</p>



<p>Typically, fluid sloshing through bony tubes in the inner ear help vertebrates sense their body’s position. CT scans revealed that the frogs’ tubes are the smallest ever recorded for adult vertebrates. Studies of other tiny animals suggest that the tubes don’t work so well in miniature. It’s difficult for the fluid to flow freely, Essner says. That means the frogs probably can’t sense how they’re twirling through the air, making it tough to prep for landing.</p>



<p>It’s possible that <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/pumpkin-toadlets-glowing-bony-plates">bony back plates</a> offer some species crash protection, but the animals may stay grounded for safety (<em>SN: 4/3/19</em>). As Essner observed, the frogs are “almost always crawling really slowly.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/plague-black-death-ancient-dna-bacteria-europe-origin-asia">Ancient bacterial DNA hints Europe’s Black Death started in Central Asia</a></h4>

              
                <p>Although best known as a plague that killed millions of Europeans from 1346 to 1353, the Black Death originated about a decade earlier in Central Asia, a new study suggests.</p>



<p>A strain of the plague-causing <em>Yersinia pestis</em> bacterium that killed people in what’s now Kyrgyzstan in 1338 and 1339 was a common ancestor of four <em>Y. pestis</em> strains previously linked to the deadly European outbreak, say archaeogeneticist Maria Spyrou of Eberhard Karls University of Tübingen in Germany and colleagues.</p>





<p>Spyrou’s group identified <em>Y. pestis</em> DNA in teeth of three individuals from an ancient Central Asian cemetery where tombstone inscriptions say that they, as well as many others buried there, died in 1338 and 1339 from an unspecified “pestilence.” Comparisons of that genetic material to modern and historic samples of <em>Y. pestis</em> DNA indicate that the <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-022-04800-3">Central Asian folks perished from an initial version of the plague bacterium that would wreak havoc on Europe</a>, the Middle East and northern Africa until the early 1800s, the scientists report June 15 in <em>Nature</em>.</p>



<p>“The source location and time when this plague emerged was most likely in Central Asia in the first half of the 14th century,” Spyrou said in a June 14 news briefing.</p>



<p>Origins of the Black Death, or bubonic plague, have long been debated. What’s certain is that <em>Y. pestis</em> gets transmitted to humans by fleas that live on rodents. <a href="https://academic.oup.com/ahr/article-abstract/125/5/1601/6040962">One current proposal holds that the plague bacterium originated in East Asia</a> and was carried across the continent starting in the 1200s as the Mongol Empire expanded. That scenario leaned on genetic evidence from European Black Death victims and written accounts of an unidentified plague outbreak encountered by Mongol invaders of Baghdad in the 1200s.</p>



<p>But the first archaeological and genetic clues to the Black Death’s place and time of birth come from Central Asia, Spyrou says. Excavations at two cemeteries in northern Kyrgyzstan almost 140 years ago revealed tombstones indicating that many people buried there in 1338 and 1339 had died of an unknown epidemic. The cemeteries were used from the mid-1200s to the mid-1300s, but tombstone inscriptions indicated that deaths spiked in 1338 and 1339. Of 467 dated tombstones, 118 mark deaths in those two years.</p>

<p>Spyrou’s group was able to reconstruct the entire <em>Y. pestis</em> genome for two of three Central Asian individuals who died in 1338 or 1339 and whose teeth contained remnants of bacterial DNA. Comparisons with the genetic instructions of 203 modern <em>Y. pestis</em> samples and 47 <em>Y. pestis</em> samples dating from the 14th to 19th centuries pegged the Central Asian genomes as a single strain that was a direct ancestor of Black Death strains.</p>



<p>The researchers also found that marmots and other rodents now living in the same region of Central Asia carry forms of <em>Y. pestis</em> closely related to the ancient variant. The <em>Y. pestis</em> variant that killed Central Asians in 1338 and 1339 may thus have emerged locally, the investigators suggest.</p>



<p>Reasons for the rise of a particularly deadly form of <em>Y. pestis</em> in Central Asia during the early 1300s remain unclear. The <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/oldest-plague-bacteria-strain-human-victim-bones">earliest known <em>Y. pestis</em> strain</a>, which dates to around 7,100 years ago in Eastern Europe, lacked a plague-inducing gene that enables rapid transmission from fleas to humans (<em>SN: 6/29/21</em>).</p>



<p>Spyrou’s group convincingly traces the origin of <em>Y. pestis</em> strains involved in Europe’s Black Death to Central Asia, says evolutionary biologist Nils Stenseth of the University of Oslo, who did not participate in the study. He regards the new findings as consistent with a scenario in which <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/bubonic-plague-was-serial-visitor-european-middle-ages">periods of warm weather in Central Asia triggered repeated plague outbreaks</a> in Europe starting in the 1300s (<em>SN: 2/23/15</em>). Troops, travelers and merchants moving along <a href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2101940118">trade routes from Asia kept bringing the plague into Europe</a>, Stenseth suspects.</p>



<p>While the newly identified <em>Y. pestis</em> strain appears to be an ancestor of later European strains, clear-cut origins of the Black Death — and other pandemics, including COVID-19 — are notoriously hard to pin down, says evolutionary geneticist Hendrik Poinar of McMaster University in Hamilton, Canada.</p>



<p>For instance, it will be challenging to determine whether the ancient <em>Y. pestis</em> strain from Central Asia existed even earlier across a broad swath of the continent, he says. If so, then a precursor strain of the Black Death may have arisen prior to 1338 in an as-yet-undetermined part of Asia. Temptations to translate ancient DNA findings into a story of the Black Death’s precise place and time of origin “need to be tempered,” he says.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/butterfly-wing-tail-loss-break-birds-escape">Butterflies may lose their ‘tails’ like lizards</a></h4>

              
                <p>On some butterfly wings, “tails” may be more than just elegant adornments. They’re survival tools too, a study suggests.</p>



<p>The tails seem to attract the attention of attacking birds, <a href="https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rspb.2022.0562">keeping them away from a butterfly’s more vital body parts</a>, researchers report May 25 in the <em>Proceedings of the Royal Society B</em>. The finding could help explain why wing tails have independently evolved multiple times across different moth and butterfly groups.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Evolutionary biologist Ariane Chotard of the National Museum of Natural History in Paris studies the wings of swallowtail butterflies, which make up the hundreds of species in the family Papilionidae.&nbsp;“A lot of these butterflies display tails,” Chotard says. “And we don&#8217;t really know why.”</p>





<p>Some butterfly species with false head or eyespot patterns on their wings are known to receive more attacks from predators in those regions. And Chotard and her colleagues wondered if tails were also a target.</p>



<p>So in the summer of 2020, the researchers collected 138 sail swallowtail butterflies (<a><em>Iphiclides podalirius</em></a>) from the wild in Ariege, France. Sail swallowtails — found throughout Eurasia — sport two, conspicuous black tails on hind wings with some blue and orange spotting, contrasting greatly with the rest of the insects’ yellow, striped coloration.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Among the collected swallowtails, 65, or 41 percent, had damaged wings, all of which had at least one tail damaged. When all 130 wings in this group of damaged butterflies were counted, more than 82 percent of the wings had damaged tails, suggesting that predators may be targeting the spindly parts.</p>



<p>To test that idea, the team kept wild-caught songbirds called great tits (<em>Parus major</em>) in cages. The researchers then showed the birds dummy butterflies made from gluing real swallowtail wings to a fake body made of small pieces of black cardboard, and filmed the birds’ attacks on the faux insects.</p>



<p>Forty-three out of 59 beak strikes, or nearly 73 percent, were on the hind wings. Twenty-three, or 39 percent, of the strikes touched both a tail and colored areas on the upper part of a hind wing simultaneously, more than any other body area on the dummies.&nbsp;</p>

</div><figcaption>A captive great tit (<em>Parus major</em>) attacks the hind wings and “tails” of a dummy made with real wings from a sail swallowtail butterfly (<em>Iphiclides podalirius</em>). A new study suggests that the tails deflect attacks away from key body parts to brittle extensions that easily tear off, allowing the insect to flee.</figcaption></figure>



<p>Chotard and her colleagues also measured how much force was needed to tear various sections of the swallowtail wing. They found that the vein of the hind wing tail was the most fragile part of the wing and is probably the location most apt to break off in a hungry bird’s beak.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Taken together, the findings suggest that swallowtail tails deflect attacks away from the butterfly’s vulnerable body to brittle extensions that easily tear off, allowing the insect to escape, the researchers say. This may be similar to the strategy some lizards use when sacrificing their detachable tails to hungry predators.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It’s unclear if there are any costs to losing one or two tails, Chotard says. “You survived, you escaped from a predator, but maybe there&#8217;s a trade-off and maybe your flight will be [slower].”</p>



<p>Some moth tails can <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/fooled-you-whirling-tails-luna-moths-deflect-bat-attacks">deflect the attacks of echolocating bats</a> (<em>SN</em><em>: 2/16/15</em>). “Now we have evidence that butterfly tails provide a similar benefit against visual predators,” says evolutionary biologist Juliette Rubin of the University of Florida in Gainesville who was not involved with the study.</p>



<p>Future work determining the survival benefits of the tails could be one next step, Rubin says. “It would be informative to see how live swallowtail butterflies — both with and without tails — fare against bird predators.”</p>

<p><a href="https://bookshop.org/a/21798/9781541674899">Bitch</a><br><em>Lucy Cooke</em><br><em>Basic Books, $30</em></p>



<p>To Charles Darwin, nature had a certain order. And in that order, males always came out on top. They were the leaders, the innovators, the wooers and the doers.</p>



<p>“The males of almost all animals have stronger passions than the females,” Darwin wrote in 1871. “The female, on the other hand, with the rarest of exceptions, is less eager.” The founder of evolutionary theory posited that throughout the animal kingdom, males are active, females are passive, and that’s pretty much that. Females, in sum, are boring.</p>





<p>That’s poppycock, Lucy Cooke writes in her latest book, <em>Bitch</em>. This blinkered view of nature as a man’s world was conceived and promulgated by Victorian men who imposed their values and world view on animals, she says. Cooke, a documentary filmmaker and the author of <em><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/truth-about-animals-isnt-always-pretty">The Truth About Animals</a></em> and two children’s books (<em>SN: 4/14/18, p. 26</em>), has traveled the world and met scientists who are exposing the truth about the sexes. She takes readers on a wild ride as she observes the ridiculous mating rituals of sage grouse, searches for orca poop (to monitor sex hormones) and watches female lemurs boss around males.</p>



<p>Through such adventures, Cooke learns that females are anything but boring. “Female animals are just as promiscuous, competitive, aggressive, dominant and dynamic as males,” she writes.</p>



<p>That may not sound radical to today’s feminists, but in the field of evolutionary biology, such a pronouncement has long bordered on the heretical. Generations of biologists have focused on male behavior and physiology, on the assumption that females are little more than baby-making machines to be won over by the strongest, showiest males.</p>





<p>Historically, when females did something potentially interesting, like exercise leadership over their social groups, many scientists scratched their heads and chalked it up as an aberration. When behavior didn’t fit the mold, like female-dominant spotted hyenas or peaceable male pinyon jays, it was either ignored or shoehorned into existing theory. For instance, ornithologists posited that aggressive female pinyon jays must suffer “the avian equivalent of PMS,” Cooke writes. The reality is that pinyon jays have a complex social hierarchy that doesn’t include the “alpha male” that scientists had expected. In recent years, scientists (many, but not all of them, female themselves) have begun to challenge Darwinian dogma about the sexes and submit it to rigorous testing.</p>



<p>Cooke draws on this recent science to systematically take down myths about females. She begins by asking what biological sex actually is — what makes a male a male, and a female a female — and shows that it’s far less black-and-white than we’ve been led to believe. Take the case of the European mole, in which the female sports gonads called ovotestes that produce eggs during the short breeding season, and testosterone the rest of the time. As a result, the female’s genitalia look just like the male’s, with a penislike clitoris and a vagina that vanishes after the breeding season.</p>



<p>The mole is just one example of sexual ambiguity among many that Cooke outlines. As the science of recent decades has revealed, even the genetics of sex is far more complicated than having either XX or XY chromosomes (which themselves are just one of many genetic systems for determining sex across the animal kingdom). In humans, males and females have the same set of about 60 sex-determining genes, which can create either testes or ovaries. Because of shared biology, the sexes are far more alike than they are different, and they exist in more of a continuum of bodies and behaviors than many people may be comfortable with.</p>



<p>Cooke also takes on many other ways scientists have misread sexual dynamics over the years, such as the myth that males benefit evolutionarily from promiscuity and females from monogamy. She addresses misconceptions about sexual cannibalism and animal genitals, complete with silicone replicas of animal vaginas. And she challenges ideas about the maternal instinct. As Cooke points out, males and females share the same neural circuitry, leading to fascinating experiments that stimulate certain nerve cells to flip male mice from infanticidal to doting dads.</p>



<p>In short, Cooke demolishes much of what you probably learned about the sexes in biology class. This may be disconcerting, even confronting for those who feel comfortable in the warm embrace of Darwinian order. But it’s also exciting, and fascinating, and very well might change the way you see the world. </p>

              <h4><a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2022/06/observations-on-published-peer-review-history/">Published Peer Review History at PLOS: Observations from the past three years</a></h4>

              
                <p>Written by <a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/author/lmorton/">Lindsay Morton</a></p>



<p><a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2019/05/plos-journals-now-open-for-published-peer-review/">Three years ago</a> PLOS implemented our version of open peer review, which we named with our typical scrupulous precision and total disregard for word count: <a href="https://plos.org/published-peer-review-history/">Published Peer Review History</a>. Since then, the PLOS journals have together published over 18,000 articles with accompanying peer review history. We&rsquo;re pleased to share more preliminary observations based on <a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2022/06/observations-on-published-peer-review-history#numbers">our first three years of data below</a>. But first, a bit of background&hellip;</p>



<h2>How published peer review works at PLOS</h2>



<p>Open peer review can mean many different things. The main unifying feature is an element of openness somewhere in the peer review process, which can range from public comments on all submissions, to an open decision letter after acceptance. PLOS&rsquo; version of open peer review is simple, flexible and modular, dictated by the choices reviewers and authors make during the peer review and publication process.</p>



<p>All PLOS journals default to anonymous peer review. Reviewers have the option to sign their peer reviews if they wish to do so, and are advised of the potential for the review to be published. After an article has been accepted for publication, authors can opt-in to publish the Peer Review History, which includes the key documents from the peer review assessment:</p>



<ul><li>Editor decision letters</li><li>Peer reviews (with reviewers&rsquo; signatures, if applicable)</li><li>Authors&rsquo; responses to reviews</li></ul>



<p>The result is four possible gradations of openness in peer review.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="862" src="https://theplosblog.plos.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2022/06/Peer-Review-options_update-2022-copy-1-1024x862.png" alt="" class="wp-image-20442" srcset="https://theplosblog.plos.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2022/06/Peer-Review-options_update-2022-copy-1-1024x862.png 1024w, https://theplosblog.plos.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2022/06/Peer-Review-options_update-2022-copy-1-300x253.png 300w, https://theplosblog.plos.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2022/06/Peer-Review-options_update-2022-copy-1-768x647.png 768w, https://theplosblog.plos.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2022/06/Peer-Review-options_update-2022-copy-1-1536x1293.png 1536w, https://theplosblog.plos.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2022/06/Peer-Review-options_update-2022-copy-1-2048x1725.png 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></figure>



<p>It is very important, we think, to note that the benefits of Published Peer Review History are by no means predicated on reviewers signing their reviews. While reviewers have the opportunity to claim credit if they so choose, the value to the wider scholarly community stems from the availability of their comments. We want to make this absolutely clear because, too often, critique of open peer review can focus on signing, missing the more vital aspect of constructive feedback.</p>



<p>PLOS Peer Review History is organized, time stamped, and machine readable, with the goal of enabling future meta-research. Each element of the history package has a sub-DOI and is tagged and indexed, making it easy to discover and cite, even if you&rsquo;re not reading it on one of the PLOS journal websites. It&rsquo;s also included in <a href="https://plos.org/text-and-data-mining/">AllofPLOS</a> for easier mining and analysis.</p>

<h2>What makes PLOS Published Peer Review History different?</h2>



<p>You might be thinking <em>&lsquo;so what?&rsquo; </em>When PLOS introduced Peer Review History in 2019, various versions of public review had been available in the scholarly marketplace for a decade or more&mdash;at BMJ, EMBO Press, and <em>eLife</em>, just to name a few.&nbsp;</p>



<p>All implementations of open review&mdash;signed and unsigned, posted as public commentary or published after the fact&mdash;serve to improve transparency and accountability, to demonstrate the quality of peer review and reinforce the validity of the published research, to acknowledge and honor peer reviewers&rsquo; contributions to the literature, and to enrich the scientific record with more expertise.</p>



<p>Our own particular version emphasizes flexibility and author control. After acceptance, PLOS authors must click a check box and <strong>opt-in</strong> to have their peer reviews published. As a large international publisher with a very broad scope, our goal with Published Peer Review History, as with Open Science in general, has been to bring openness within easy reach for all, while at the same time respecting researchers&rsquo; different values and requirements across disciplines, career stages, and regions. Opt-in works at scale for all the researchers across our portfolio.</p>



<p>The opt-in model is somewhat unusual, as compared to the more established pioneers in Open Peer Review, many of whom mandate openness (e.g. BMJ) or use an opt-out model (e.g. EMBO Press). PLOS&rsquo; opt-in approach results in lower uptake: on average, 40% of PLOS authors opt-in, as compared to the reported greater than 95% of EMBO Press authors who <a href="https://www.embo.org/features/a-decade-of-transparent-peer-review/">don&rsquo;t opt-out</a>. At the same time, PLOS&rsquo; large publication volume means that, even with a lower rate of uptake, the journals contribute significantly to the total number of articles with public peer reviews available across the published literature. (PLOS journals together published nearly 18,000 articles in 2020. For comparison, the same year <a href="https://elifesciences.org/inside-elife/6771f3db/annual-report-2020-in-review"><em>eLife </em>published</a> 1,870 articles, <em>BMJ Open</em> published 3,610<a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2022/06/observations-on-published-peer-review-history#asterisk">*</a>, and the five EMBO Press journals published 1,063*.) This absolute scale is helpful with normalizing practices and behaviors.</p>



<p>The opt-in model, in combination with our size and breadth of scope also produces a wealth of data, which we hope can help us to better understand the communities we serve, and inform our future direction with regard to published review.</p>



<h2 id="numbers">Published Peer Review History by the numbers, May 2019 to May 2022</h2>



<p>Since PLOS Published Peer Review History was first introduced, opt-in has remained a remarkably consistent 40%, year after year.<a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2022/06/observations-on-published-peer-review-history#asterisk">**</a></p>



<figure class="wp-block-table"><table><tbody><tr><td><strong>Year of acceptance</strong></td><td><strong>Opt-ins</strong></td><td><strong>Total eligible articles&nbsp;</strong></td><td><strong>Percent opt-in</strong></td></tr><tr><td>2019</td><td>1,300</td><td>3,383</td><td>38%</td></tr><tr><td>2020</td><td>7,107</td><td>17,775</td><td>40%</td></tr><tr><td>2021</td><td>7,585</td><td>18,923</td><td>40%</td></tr><tr><td>2022</td><td>2,387</td><td>5,983</td><td>40%</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<p>PLOS&rsquo; two highly selective journals, <em>PLOS Biology</em> and <em>PLOS Medicine</em>, also saw the highest rates of Published Peer Review opt-in&nbsp; among accepted authors, followed by two of the four community journals, <em>PLOS Computational Biology</em>, and <em>PLOS Genetics</em>.<em> PLOS ONE</em> and the remaining two community journals,<em> PLOS Pathogens</em> and <em>PLOS NTDs</em> saw the lowest opt-in rates. <em>PLOS ONE</em>&rsquo;s broad scope and high publication volume accounts for its lower average opt-in rate. Lower adoption among <em>Pathogens </em>and <em>NTDs </em>authors as compared with the other community journals may likewise relate to subject-specific norms and preferences.&nbsp;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-table"><table><tbody><tr><td><strong>Journal</strong></td><td><strong>Opt-ins</strong></td><td><strong>Total eligible articles</strong></td><td><strong>Percent opt-in</strong></td></tr><tr><td>Biology</td><td>294</td><td>463</td><td>63%</td></tr><tr><td>Medicine</td><td>425</td><td>688</td><td>62%</td></tr><tr><td>Computational&nbsp; Biology</td><td>1,038</td><td>1,883</td><td>55%</td></tr><tr><td>Genetics</td><td>561</td><td>1,129</td><td>50%</td></tr><tr><td>Pathogens</td><td>532</td><td>1,369</td><td>39%</td></tr><tr><td>ONE</td><td>14,911</td><td>38,918</td><td>38%</td></tr><tr><td>NTDs</td><td>618</td><td>1,614</td><td>38%</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<p>When <em>PLOS ONE </em>opt-in rates are broken out by discipline a pattern of subject-area preference becomes apparent. In fields with more than 100 published articles in the time period, opt-ins were strongest in computational biology, public health fields (women&rsquo;s health, public health, mental health), research on caregiving (healthcare, nursing), and specific medical disciplines (emergency medicine, neurology, obstetrics, urology, anesthesiology, pulmonology, clinical trials, etc.). Lower opt-in rates were observed in engineering, math, chemistry, materials science, earth science, geography and various branches of biology (molecular biology, microbiology, cell biology, biotechnology), as well as in fields where medical and bench science intersect, such as basic cancer research.&nbsp;</p>



<p>While clinical in their potential translational applications, <em>PLOS NTDs </em>and <em>PLOS Pathogens</em> frequently publish research on the molecular and cellular aspects of disease, and therefore might expect commensurately lower opt-in rates.</p>



<p>However, <em>PLOS Biology</em> also publishes in the biological fields where <em>PLOS ONE</em> opt-in tends to be weaker&mdash;yet it has the highest opt-in rate of any journal. Why is that? Perhaps, the journal&rsquo;s hands-on, personalized editorial and peer review process influences author opt-in. This would be a fascinating area for investigation.</p>



<h2>Observations on peer review signing&nbsp;</h2>



<p>PLOS has always allowed reviewers to sign their reviews if they choose, but it wasn&rsquo;t until the system updates introduced at the same time as Published Peer Review History (May 22, 2019) that we gained the ability to easily and systematically measure signing. Since then, we&rsquo;ve received 49,555 signed reviews (17.81% of all completed reviews). Those signed reviews were performed by 40,276 individuals (about 19.26% of active reviewers) and were linked to 32,869 manuscripts (35.55% of manuscripts considered).</p>



<p>Overall, reviewers&rsquo; decisions to sign reviews are distributed across journals and subject areas in a pattern similar to authors&rsquo; decisions to publish reviews. Signing rates were higher in public health, medicine, and related disciplines and less common in some branches of biology, as well as the physical sciences, earth sciences, engineering and math. Of articles with published peer reviews, 44% also had at least one signed review.</p>



<p>The clearest determinant of signed review was the reviewer&rsquo;s recommendation (although reviewer recommendations are visible only to Academic Editors and the journal office). Signing rates were highest among reviewers recommending accept or revise decisions. For that reason, rates of signing on published articles (42.19%) are higher than for manuscripts generally.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-table"><table><tbody><tr><td><strong>Journal Name</strong></td><td><strong>Accept</strong></td><td><strong>Minor</strong><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;Revision</strong></td><td><strong>Major Revision</strong></td><td><strong>Reject</strong></td></tr><tr><td>Biology</td><td>19.74%</td><td>17.32%</td><td>11.59%</td><td>3.62%</td></tr><tr><td>Computational Biology</td><td>16.49%</td><td>16.15%</td><td>12.30%</td><td>4.59%</td></tr><tr><td>Genetics</td><td>12.15%</td><td>11.23%</td><td>7.60%</td><td>3.19%</td></tr><tr><td>Medicine</td><td>35.03%</td><td>35.23%</td><td>31.99%</td><td>25.50%</td></tr><tr><td>NTDs</td><td>18.29%</td><td>19.20%</td><td>13.01%</td><td>5.30%</td></tr><tr><td>ONE</td><td>17.42%</td><td>17.48%</td><td>14.38%</td><td>7.85%</td></tr><tr><td>Pathogens</td><td>8.40%</td><td>7.89%</td><td>5.56%</td><td>1.71%&nbsp;</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<h2>Listening to authors and reviewers</h2>



<p>At PLOS we have formal and informal conversations with our stakeholders and community members; we gather feedback in person and by email; we conduct surveys and structured interviews; we do meta-research; we observe.</p>



<p>Three years ago, PLOS chose an opt-in over an opt-out model of published review for a number of reasons. Our in-house editorial teams and editorial boards alike were committed to open peer review, and committed to ensuring it was only received positively by giving authors a real choice in the decision. More practically, PLOS serves more than 200 communities of research, each with their own needs and priorities. Open peer review is too important a development to force on those who have concerns and need to see a community embrace it first. Therefore, we chose to make openness easy. By leaving the door open, hopefully we can learn more from those who choose to walk through. And, it&rsquo;s our hope that information like this can help inform the next round of discussions, innovations, and policies, leading ultimately to a more efficient, equitable, and trustworthy peer review system.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/black-hole-rogue-wandering-mass-sun-gravity-neutron-star">A celestial loner might be the first known rogue black hole</a></h4>

              
                <p>A solitary celestial object — more massive than the sun, yet far smaller — is wandering the galaxy a few thousand light-years from Earth. It might be the first isolated stellar-mass black hole to be detected in the Milky Way. Or it might be one of the heaviest neutron stars known.</p>



<p>The interstellar wanderer first revealed itself in 2011, when its gravity briefly magnified the light from a more distant star. But at the time, its true nature eluded researchers. Now, two teams of astronomers have analyzed Hubble Space Telescope images to unmask the traveler’s identity — and have come to somewhat different conclusions.</p>





<p>The mysterious rogue is <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.13296">a black hole roughly seven times as massive as the sun</a>, one team reports in a study in press in the <em>Astrophysical Journal</em>. <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.01903">Or it’s a bit lighter</a> — a mere two to four times the weight of our nearest star — and therefore either an unusually lightweight black hole or a curiously hefty neutron star, another group reports in a study in press in the <em>Astrophysical Journal Letters</em>. &nbsp;</p>



<p>Neutron stars and stellar-mass black holes form when massive stars — at least several times the heft of the sun — collapse under their own gravity at the end of their lives. Astronomers believe that about a billion neutron stars and roughly 100 million stellar-mass black holes <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/we-share-milky-way-100-million-black-holes">lurk in our galaxy</a> (<em>SN: 8/18/17</em>). But these objects aren’t easy to spot. Neutron stars are so tiny — about the size of a city — that they don’t produce much light. And black holes emit no light at all.</p>



<p>To detect these kinds of objects, scientists typically observe how they affect their surroundings. “The only way that we can find them is if they influence something else,” says Kailash Sahu, an astronomer at the Space Telescope Science Institute in Baltimore.</p>



<p>To date, scientists have detected nearly two dozen stellar-mass black holes. (These relatively lightweight black holes are puny compared to the <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/most-ancient-supermassive-black-hole-quasar-bafflingly-big">supermassive behemoths that sit at the center of most galaxies</a>, including our own (<em>SN: 1/18/21</em>).) To do so, researchers have watched how these objects interact with their nearby celestial neighbors. When a black hole is locked in a gravitational dance with another star, it rips away matter from its partner. As that material falls onto the black hole, it emits X-rays, which telescopes orbiting the Earth can detect.</p>



<p>But finding black holes in binary systems doesn’t paint a whole picture of the black hole kingdom. Because these objects are continually accreting matter, it’s challenging to determine the mass at which they formed. And since birthweight is a key characteristic of a black hole, that’s a significant drawback to looking at binary systems, Sahu says. “If we want to understand the properties of black holes, it’s best to find isolated ones.”</p>



<p>For more than a decade, researchers have been scanning the heavens for solitary black holes. The searches have hinged on <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/einstein-theory-general-relativity-gravity-black-holes-cosmos">Einstein’s theory of general relativity</a>, which states that any massive object, even an unseen one, bends space in its vicinity (<em>SN: 2/3/21</em>). That bending causes light from background stars to be magnified and distorted, a phenomenon known as gravitational microlensing. By measuring changes in the brightness and apparent position of stars, scientists can calculate the mass of the intervening object that’s acting like a lens — a technique that’s <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/fewer-big-rogue-planets-roam-galaxy-recount-shows">rounded up a few extrasolar planets</a> as well (<em>SN: 7/24/17</em>).</p>



<p>In 2011, researchers announced that they had spotted a star <a href="http://ogle.astrouw.edu.pl/ogle4/ews/2011/blg-0462.html">that suddenly had gotten more than 200 times brighter</a>. But those initial observations, made using telescopes in Chile and New Zealand, were unable to reveal whether the star’s apparent position was also changing. And that information is key to pinning down the mass of the intervening object. If it’s a heavyweight, its gravity would distort space so much that the star would appear to move. But even a “big” shift in the star’s position would have been extremely small and hard to detect. And unfortunately fine details in astronomical images captured by ground-based telescopes <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/antarctic-ice-dome-world-clearest-views-night-sky-milky-way">tend to be blurred out</a> because of our planet’s turbulent atmosphere (<em>SN: 7/29/20</em>).</p>



<p>To circumvent this Earthly limitation, two independent teams of astronomers turned to the Hubble Space Telescope. This observatory can capture extremely detailed images since it orbits above most of Earth’s atmosphere. &nbsp;</p>



<p>Both groups found that the star’s location shifted over the course of several years. One of the teams, led by Sahu, concluded that the star’s apparent dance was caused by an object roughly seven times as hefty as the sun. A star of that mass would have been blazingly bright in the Hubble images, but the researchers saw nothing. Something that heavy and dark must be a black hole, the team reports.</p>



<p>But another group of researchers, led by astronomer Casey Lam at the University of California, Berkeley, found different results. Lam and her colleagues calculated that the mass of the lensing object was lower, only about two to four times the mass of the sun. It could therefore be either a neutron star or a black hole, the group concluded.</p>



<p>Whatever it is, it’s an intriguing object, says astronomer Jessica Lu, a member of Lam’s team also at UC Berkeley. That’s because it’s a bit of an oddball in terms of mass. It’s either one of the most massive neutron stars discovered to date, or it’s one of the least massive black holes known, Lu says. “It falls within this strange region we call the mass gap.”</p>



<p>Despite the disagreement, these are thrilling results, says Will M. Farr, an astrophysicist at Stony Brook University in New York not involved in either study. “To be working at the instrumental limit at the real forefront of what’s measurable is very exciting.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/supersonic-sonic-booms-acoustics-cities">Why even small sonic booms are more annoying in cities</a></h4>

              
                <p>Sonic booms can be particularly annoying in cities, where tall buildings and narrow streets boost noise levels and cause the noise to linger, new research shows.</p>



<p>Planes traveling faster than the speed of sound create a shock wave in the form of a short-lived boom. These intense sonic booms have harmed people’s hearing, shattered windows and caused other <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/supersonic-transports-come-closer-reality">physical damage to homes and buildings</a> (<em>SN: 12/19/64</em>). NASA is developing aircraft with more subdued booms, but the sound won’t go away entirely. Even modest booms might be a problem in cities.</p>





<p>“The noise levels induced by these lower-level booms are still expected to be significant,” says study coauthor Didier Dragna of the École Centre de Lyon in France.</p>



<p>Dragna and colleagues simulated booms from supersonic planes passing over buildings. For a building standing out in the open, boom-induced noise lasted about a tenth of a second. Sound reflecting from the building boosts noise levels slightly for the side facing an approaching plane and reduces it on the side facing away.</p>



<p>For packed cityscapes, however, noise reflected from buildings following a sonic boom fills in the regions between buildings and <a href="https://asa.scitation.org/doi/full/10.1121/10.0010452?dm_i=3Q4Y%2C1G8HT%2C68V2ZI%2C5B8ET%2C1">resonates like the echoes of a hand clap in an empty hall</a>, the team reports in the June <em>Journal of the Acoustical Society of America</em>. Their simulations showed that even after the initial boom has passed the noise persists for several seconds, creating what Dragna describes as a thunderous, window- and door-rattling rumble.<br><br>Civilian aircraft in the United States are generally prohibited from traveling over land at supersonic speeds. But NASA will begin test flights of its “quiet” <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/specials/Quesst/">X-59 supersonic aircraft</a> over cities in 2024. “It is important to predict what will be the noise levels and the annoyance due to these supersonic planes,” Dragna says.</p>

<p>People who can afford luxury goods tend to buy them, and to show them off.  “This is unsurprising given the myriad social benefits associated with being perceived as well-off and high status,” note the authors of a<a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2022-53095-001"> new study</a>, led by Shalena Srna at the University of Michigan. But in some situations, there might be downsides to conspicuous consumption. After all, as the team writes: “it conveys a boastful self-interest, which is incompatible, in people’s minds, with pro-sociality”.</p>



<p>So what happens when — as is so often the case — it’s in our interests to work with others? Given the opportunity, do we show off, and signal high status — or do we choose to be more modest? The team’s findings, reported in the <em>Journal of Personality and Social Psychology: Attitudes and Social Cognition</em>, contain some important insights.</p>



<span id="more-46394"></span>



<p>In an initial online study, the team adopted a version of the widely used <a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/prisoner-dilemma/">Prisoner’s Dilemma (PD)</a> game. Participants were told that they’d have to decide whether to co-operate with a partner to do half each of 60 units of work (solving captchas) — or to defect. If both partners chose to defect, they’d have to complete 60 units of work each. If only one did, the co-operator would have to do 90 units, while the defector wouldn’t do any.</p>



<p>Before they made their decision, they were shown an avatar that was purportedly made by their partner. They were informed that their partner had chosen the hairstyle, skin tone and clothing — and also whether to include a luxury logo on the clothing, or to opt for unbranded clothing. In fact, the partners were fictional and the avatars were created by the team. They generated one male and one female avatar (the gender was matched to the participant’s gender), which were identical, except that some wore a shirt featuring a Gucci, Louis Vuitton or Burberry logo, while the other had an unbranded shirt.</p>



<p>The results showed that participants elected to co-operate with partners whose avatars had unbranded clothing 57% of the time, but when the avatar sported a luxury logo, this figure dropped to 45%. A subsequent questionnaire revealed that the participants indeed perceived partners with logo-wearing avatars as trying harder to signal status and wealth (and indeed to have more status and wealth) — and expected them to be less co-operative, and more self-interested.</p>



<p>A second study, in which participants could first choose the design of their own avatar, found that those who chose branded rather than unbranded clothing themselves were still less likely to choose to co-operate with partners with brand-boasting vs logo-free avatars.</p>



<p>The team then switched to a more real-world setting — social network profiles. They found further support for these initial results: participants who saw (fictional) profiles that used status-signalling posts and hashtags were less likely to recommend that individual for admittance into a group that prioritized co-operation, selflessness and generosity.</p>



<p>The work also produced another key result: when it was useful to appear co-operative  — when a group that participants wanted to join stressed its desire for co-operative, prosocial people — the participants tended to become strategically modest; when choosing from prewritten social media posts that described various activities, they were less likely to go for posts that signalled status. (It’s worth noting, however, that when the goal was to be perceived as <em>competitive</em>, status-signalling was beneficial.)</p>



<p>This last finding suggests that we’re aware that status-signalling can be counter-productive, and understand when to avoid it. However, we surely all know people who get this wrong. Many people show off their status to &#8220;friends&#8221; through posts on Instagram, Facebook and Twitter, the team notes. “Such posts may be beneficial for communicating one’s wealth and status, but as we have shown, they can also have negative effects.” In 2019, Stephen M. Garcia and colleagues even found that people <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/1948550618783712">believe signalling status will make them more attractive potential friends — but when seeking friends, we in fact prefer people who are more modest</a>. So while we might have some implicit understanding of when not to signal status, it’s clearly not perfect.</p>



<p>Garcia’s research was in the US and the new work was on participants mostly from Western countries. Clearly, non-WEIRD work in this area is needed.  But this new paper certainly highlights a clear disadvantage of status signalling in Western contexts, and suggests that we should be more careful. There are all kinds of environments, including schools and workplaces, where this could clearly have implications for relationships. There’s an ongoing debate about the pros and cons of school uniforms, for example. In schools without uniforms, kids who choose to wear luxury brands might think that they’re benefitting from signalling high status — but if this makes the rest of the class view them as less co-operative and more self-interested, that’s a clear downside for everyone.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/new-asteroid-gaia-map-milky-way-galaxy-stars">New Gaia data paint the most detailed picture yet of the Milky Way</a></h4>

              
                <p>1.6 billion stars. 11.4 million galaxies. 158,000 asteroids.</p>



<p>One spacecraft.</p>



<p>The European Space Agency’s Gaia space observatory, which launched in 2013, has long surpassed its goal of charting more than a billion <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/gaia-missions-milky-way-map-pinpoints-locations-billion-plus-stars">stars in the Milky Way</a> (<em>SN: 10/15/16)</em>. On June 13, the mission extended that map into new dimensions, releasing more detailed measurements of hundreds of millions of stars, plus — for the first time — asteroids, galaxies and the dusty medium between stars.</p>





<p>“Suddenly you have a flood of data,” says Laurent Eyer, an astrophysicist at the University of Geneva who has worked on Gaia for years. For some topics in astronomy, the new results effectively replace all the observations that were taken before, Eyer says. “The data is better. It’s amazing.”</p>



<p>Data in the new survey, which were collected from 2014 to 2017, are already leading to some discoveries — including the presence of surprisingly massive&nbsp; <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/stars-may-keep-spinning-fast-long-old-age">“starquakes”</a> on the surfaces of thousands of stars (<em>SN: 8/2/19</em>). But more than anything, the release is a new tool for astronomers, one that will aid their efforts to understand how stars, planets and entire galaxies form and evolve.</p>



<p>Here are a few of the long-standing puzzles the data could help solve.&nbsp;</p>



<h4>Asteroid mishmash</h4>



<p>The asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter is a mess of history. After the Earth and other planets formed, the rocky building blocks that were left over smashed into each other, leaving behind jumbled fragments. But if scientists know enough about individual asteroids, they can reconstruct when and <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/ryugu-came-two-other-asteroids">where they came from</a> <em>(SN: 4/13/19)</em>. And that can provide a peek into the solar system’s earliest days.</p>

<p>Gaia’s massive new dataset may help solve this puzzle, says Federica Spoto, an astrophysicist at the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics in Cambridge, Mass. It includes data on the chemical makeup of over 60,000 asteroids — six times more than researchers had such details on before using other tools. That information can be essential for tracing asteroids back to their shattering origins.</p>



<p>“You can go back in time and try to understand all the formation and evolution of the solar system,” says Spoto, a Gaia collaborator.<strong> “</strong>That’s something huge that before Gaia we couldn’t even think about.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Asteroids aren’t just pieces of the past, though; they’re also dangerous. The new data could reveal asteroids that are <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/first-time-asteroid-has-been-found-nearer-sun-than-venus">next to impossible to spot</a> from Earth because they orbit too close to the sun, says Thomas Burbine, a planetary scientist at Mount Holyoke College in South Hadley, Mass., who is not involved with the mission <em>(SN: 2/15/20)</em>. Since these asteroids would have originally come from farther out (say, the asteroid belt), they can tell us about the rocks going past Earth that can potentially hit us. “We’ll know our neighborhood better,” Burbine says.</p>



<h4>Dating a star</h4>



<p>It is notoriously difficult to measure <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/star-age-calculation-astronomy-life-cycle">the age of stars</a> (<em>SN: 7/23/21)</em>. “It’s not uncommon to have uncertainty of more than a billion years,” says Alessandro Savino, an astrophysicist at the University of California, Berkeley who is not involved with Gaia. Unlike brightness or location, age is not directly visible. Astronomers have to rely on theories of how stars evolve to predict ages from what they can measure.</p>



<p>If past versions of the Gaia survey were like a photograph of stars, the new release is like shifting the photograph from black and white to color. It provides a deeper look at hundreds of millions of stars by measuring their temperature, gravity and chemistry. “You imagine the star as this point in space, but then they have so many properties,” Spoto says. “That’s what Gaia is giving you.”</p>



<p>Although these kinds of measurements are far from new, they have never been collected in the Milky Way on such a scale before. Those data could provide more insight into how stars evolve. “We can improve the resolution of our clocks,” Savino says.&nbsp;</p>



<h4>Milky Way snacks</h4>



<p>Though it may seem unchanging, the Milky Way is actually gorging on a steady diet of smaller galaxies —it’s even in the process of eating one right now. But for decades, predictions of when and how these cosmic mergers happen have been at odds with evidence from our galaxy, says Bertrand Goldman, an astrophysicist at the International Space University in Strasbourg, France, who is not involved in the Gaia data release. &nbsp;“That has been controversial for a long time,” Goldman says, “but I think that Gaia will certainly shed light.”</p>



<p>The key is to be able to pick apart <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/giant-wave-gas-star-nursery-lurks-near-our-solar-system">different structures in the Milky Way</a> and see how old they are (<em>SN: 1/10/20)</em>. Gaia’s latest release helps in two ways: By mapping the chemistry of stars and by measuring their motion. Previous versions of the survey described how millions of stars were moving, but mostly in two dimensions. The new catalog quadruples the number of stars with full 3-D trajectories from 7 million to 33 million.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This has implications beyond our neighborhood. Most of the mass in the universe is contained in galaxies like the Milky Way, so knowing how our own galaxy works goes a long way to understanding space on the largest scales. And the more scientists understand the parts of galaxies they can see, the more they can learn about <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/dark-matter-milky-way-galaxy-central-bar-stars-slow-rotation">dark matter</a>, the mysterious substance that exerts gravity but doesn’t interact with light (<em>SN: 6/25/21)</em>.</p>



<p>Even as astronomers mine this latest dataset, they are already looking ahead to future treasure hunts. The next round is years off, but it is expected to enable the discovery of thousands of exoplanets, produce rare measurements of black holes and help astronomers clock how fast the universe is expanding. In part, this is because Gaia is designed to track the motion of objects in space, and that gets easier as more time passes. So Gaia’s observations can only get more powerful. “Like good wine, they age very, very well,” Savino says.</p>

Barlow sent a forthcoming book chapter from his 2016 retrospective, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Barlow-Neurotic-Paradox-Routledge-Library/dp/1138850799" target="_blank"><i>The Neurotic Paradox, Volume 1: Progress in Understanding and Treating Anxiety and Related Disorders</i></a>. A sort-of not-really apology appeared on p. 6-7:</p><blockquote>But it was also during this time [late 60s-early 70s] that I undertook what has come to be from my own personal point of view the most regrettable initiative in my clinical research career. Specifically ... I began treating and evaluating the effects of [covert sensitization]&nbsp; treatment in individuals with what came to be called paraphilias but what was then called sexual deviation (Barlow, 1974a). While our focus was mostly on pedophilia (e.g. Barlow, Leitenberg, &amp; Agras, 1969), the aggressive behavior of rapists (e.g. Abel, Barlow, Blanchard, &amp; Guild, 1977), and other paraphilias (e.g. Hayes, Brownell, &amp; Barlow, 1978), included in this series of studies were participants presenting with same-sex arousal patterns with consenting adults. (e.g., Barlow, Leitenberg, &amp; Agras, 1969). At that time homosexuality was considered a disorder in all systems of nosology and, under extreme pressures from society and the associated stigma, these individuals sought out treatment; so very few clinicians even gave it a second thought.

<h4>Particle perspectives</h4>



<p><em>Scientists are tracking the movements of subatomic particles called muons to reveal the inner worlds of pyramids, volcanoes and more, <strong>Emily Conover</strong> reported in “<a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/muon-subatomic-particle-volcano-pyramid-physics">Muons open doors</a>” (</em>SN: 4/23/22, p. 22<em>).</em></p>



<p>Reader and longtime subscriber<strong> John Ewald</strong> praised <strong>Conover’s</strong> “enjoyable and detailed” reporting. “She alerted us to concepts and investigations that are honestly new to me,” <strong>Ewald</strong> wrote. “She carried us through those things with a pace that let me emerge [at the end] to say, ‘No particle like it.’ ”</p>





<p><strong>Ewald</strong> also appreciated that <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/to-solve-mysteries-scientists-look-to-muons">the issue’s editor’s note</a> gave an inside look into how the idea for <strong>Conover’s</strong> feature bloomed (<em>SN: 4/23/22, p. 2</em>). Editor in chief <strong>Nancy Shute</strong> wrote that physicists sometimes consider muons a nuisance because they get in the way of many experiments. But <strong>Conover</strong> noticed an exciting trend: scientists reimagining the pesky particles as useful tools for discovery. <strong>Shute</strong> “added information, so I learned from her writing too,” <strong>Ewald </strong>wrote.</p>



<h4>A dynamic brain</h4>



<p><em>A study linked COVID-19 with reduced gray matter in parts of the brain associated with the sense of smell, but it’s still unclear if the changes are harmful or permanent, <strong>Laura S­anders</strong> reported in “<a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coronavirus-covid-brain-change-size-shape">COVID-19 can change a person’s brain</a>” (</em>SN: 4/23/22, p. 8<em>).</em></p>



<p>News coverage of the study, with headlines about brain damage and shrinkage, concerned many in the public, <strong>Sanders</strong> reported. But the brain typically transforms throughout life — including during adolescence and pregnancy — and those changes are not necessarily a cause for alarm. Some readers were relieved to learn that the brain is not so static. “The fact that the brain is constantly changing shape due to various stimuli makes me feel less worried about COVID changes,” Facebook user <strong>Bel Vedere</strong> wrote. “It would certainly be interesting to see the long-term follow-up to these studies.”</p>



<p>The story also eased the mind of reader <strong>Lynne Mullins</strong>. After seeing some alarming coverage of the study’s results, “it is reassuring that answers won’t be available for a while,” <strong>Mullins </strong>wrote.</p>

<h4>Online corner</h4>



<p><em>As part of </em>Science News<em>’ centennial celebration, we created a quiz to test our readers’ knowledge of 100 years of science stories. The quiz, posted on our website in late April, asked people to guess <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/science-news-history-headline-quiz">when in the last century 15 headlines were published</a>.</em></p>



<p>An article featured in the quiz, “<a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/science-news-history-headline-quiz">The Earth is a soup-kettle</a>,” was published in (spoiler alert!) 1932 and reported on geologist Arthur Holmes’ idea for how continents could float atop “boiling” rock (<em>SN: 9/10/32, p. 162</em>). At the time, the theory of plate tectonics did not yet exist. Reader <strong>Martin Kappeyne</strong> asked why the piece didn’t reference meteorologist Alfred Wegener’s continental drift theory, which dates back to 1912.</p>



<p>That story, written by Frank Thone, “focused primarily on the question of Earth losing heat — and not the idea of continental drift,” says special projects editor <strong>Elizabeth Quill</strong>.</p>



<p>But Thone <em>did</em> slip in a mention of the theory: “Thus are mountain folds thrown up on the edge of continents, Prof. Holmes thinks; for he is one of those geologists who believe in the theory of shifting and migrating continents, most notably advocated by the great German scientist, von Wegener.”</p>



<p><strong>Quill </strong>doesn’t claim to know what was going on in Thone’s mind, “and his coverage choices probably had a lot to do with what was occupying the attention of scientists in his circle at that snapshot in time,” she says. “But the lack of emphasis on continental drift might have something to do with how contentious the idea was.” In a look back at <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/earth-plate-tectonics-volcanoes-earthquakes-faults">the emergence of plate tectonics</a> as a unifying theory, <strong>Carolyn Gramling</strong> reported that debates between “mobilists” who supported continental drift and “fixists” who opposed it were raging in the 1920s. In the next decades, many geologists turned their attention to other matters until interest in the idea rekindled in the 1950s, when new data surfaced from the bottom of the oceans (<em>SN: 1/16/21, p. 16</em>).</p>



<p>Online readers scored an average of 7.8 out of 15 on the headline quiz. Think you’ll get more? <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/science-news-history-headline-quiz">Take the quiz yourself</a>. </p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/predicting-damage-caused-by-extreme-storms">Predicting the damage caused by extreme storms</a></h4>

              
                <p>Growing up in Miami, <em>Science News</em> earth and climate writer Carolyn Gramling knew that hurricanes were a part of life. When Hurricane Andrew hit in 1992, she and her mom huddled in the innermost room of their house, listening all night to a battery-powered radio as winds of more than 250 kilometers per hour shook the house. “I was listening to people calling and saying the hurricane was in their house, what do they do?” Gramling told me.</p>



<p>Her family’s house survived, but many other families weren’t as lucky. The Category 5 storm destroyed or damaged more than 125,000 homes, leaving 160,000 people homeless. “It was transformational for Miami,” Gramling says. After the storm, Florida adopted some of the nation’s strictest building codes to reduce wind damage.</p>





<p>The winds and rain from tropical storms are expected to get more intense as the planet warms. Hurricane Dorian hit the Bahamas in 2019 with winds up to 300 km/h, flattening entire neighborhoods. And as Gramling reports in this issue, scientists are racing to figure out what communities will need to do to survive the coming megastorms fueled by climate change.</p>



<p>To learn more about that effort, Gramling visited the Wall of Wind at Florida International University, or FIU, her alma mater, while on a recent trip to Miami. It’s an airplane hangar kitted out with humongous fans that can generate wind speeds of up to 252 km/h. Engineers from around the world visit the Wall of Wind to test how models of buildings and landscapes fare in the blast, with the goal of designing and developing infrastructure that can better withstand extreme forces.</p>



<p>A new facility to be built at FIU, funded by the National Science Foundation, will be an even more powerful tool. It will test structures <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/hurricane-season-testing-extreme-wind-water-conditions">against stronger winds and against water</a>, adding giant water tanks to the mix. That’s essential since storm surges cause much of a hurricane’s damage and loss of life. “We really don’t know what Mother Nature is going to do,” Gramling says. Researchers will be able to combine data from the facility, which is still in the planning stages, with field observations after natural disasters and computer simulations to predict how different regions could be affected.</p>



<p>Experiencing Hurricane Andrew helped shape her career as a scientist, Gramling says. She studied geology in college, and then oceanography in graduate school. “Living in Miami, climate and ocean are part of your formative experience,” she says. “I wanted to understand it, and I wanted to help other people understand it.” </p>



<p>I’m glad Gramling has put her scientific chops and reporting skills to work for <em>Science News</em> and our readers. Earth’s climate and weather systems are dauntingly complex, and so is the research about them. Gramling has a knack for describing that science in a way that even this lowly magazine editor can understand, while also sharing her fascination with how the world around us works (see, for instance, her admiration for the epic story of mammals in <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/mammal-world-evolution-innovation-dinosaurs-paleontology">this book review</a>). And if a visit to the Wall of Wind helps us grasp it, so much the better.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/covid-19-nasal-vaccines-pfizer-moderna-fluenz-tetra-flumist">Nasal vaccines for COVID-19 offer hope and face hurdles</a></h4>

              
                <p>A few weeks ago, I was obsessed with my nose and throat. I was on a trip to Seattle to speak at a small, masks-required virology meeting about being a journalist during a pandemic. I went to graduate school there, so I was thrilled to see old friends and colleagues. But the irony that I was risking getting infected amid rising COVID-19 cases to get on a plane to talk with virologists about the pandemic didn’t escape me. I spent the whole week on high alert for the slightest hint of a sore throat or a runny nose. Despite masking, I worried that I’d get sick and be stuck thousands of miles from home or that I’d unknowingly pass the virus on to someone else.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Luckily, this story has a happy ending. I didn’t catch the coronavirus. None of my friends or former colleagues got sick. Although I didn’t escape completely unscathed; I did come down with a mystery, non-COVID cold that I suspect I caught from a friend’s baby. Still, the experience made me wonder ​​— what if I didn’t have to worry so much about becoming a disease spreader because there were COVID-19 vaccines that helped my body control the virus in my nose?</p>





<aside class="wp-block-sciencenews-inline-related-post alignleft"><h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/sign-up-for-e-mail-updates-on-the-coronavirus-outbreak">Sign up for e-mail updates on the latest coronavirus news and research</a></h4></aside>



<p>Researchers are working on vaccines that would hopefully do just that. You squirt these vaccines into your nostrils, rather than inject them into your arm muscle like the current COVID-19 shots. Sprayed up the nose, the vaccines teach our immune systems to fortify our nostrils against coronavirus, perhaps meaning we get less sick or making us less likely to transmit the virus to other people.</p>



<p>Jabs in the arm may not be as good at preventing transmission as nasal spray vaccines, some scientists suspect. The shots <em>are</em> better at building defenses that circulate in the blood or fluid that surrounds cells, which makes them great at protecting the lungs. And they have done what they are designed to do: <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/covid-coronavirus-vaccines-hospital-cases-rates-unvaccinated">curb severe disease and death</a> (<em>SN: 8/31/21</em>). <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/covid-19-second-booster-shot-vaccine-immune-system">Booster doses help fend off severe COVID-19</a> better than the first two shots — especially for older people, studies show (<em>SN: 4/29/22</em>). But even with death rates down, that doesn’t mean our fight with coronavirus is over. Waning immune defenses combined with slippery versions of the coronavirus that can evade parts of our immune systems leave vaccinated people susceptible to infection. So we still need additional protection.</p>



<p>A panel of experts advising the U.S. Food and Drug Administration will meet later this month to weigh in on whether we might need a vaccine update for the fall. Updated shots may indeed be on the horizon: Preliminary data from vaccine developer Moderna show that its latest vaccine, which includes both omicron and the original virus, <a href="https://investors.modernatx.com/news/news-details/2022/Moderna-Announces-Omicron-Containing-Bivalent-Booster-Candidate-mRNA-1273.214-Demonstrates-Superior-Antibody-Response-Against-Omicron/default.aspx">boosts the immune response against omicron</a> as well as other variants such as delta, the company announced on June 8.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And on June 7 the FDA advisory committee recommended that the agency authorize a new COVID-19 vaccine for emergency use. This one, developed by the company Novavax, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/covid-19-coronavirus-novavax-vaccine-results-south-africa-variant">is based on a traditional method</a> —&nbsp; showing the immune system purified viral proteins — which may be appealing to still unvaccinated people who are hesitant about the novel mRNA technology in Moderna’s and Pfizer’s shots (<em>SN: 1/28/21</em>). Other experts are working on vaccines that might hold up against an onslaught of variants, both present and future.&nbsp;</p>

<p>And then, there are the nasal spray vaccines. They could not only protect our lungs, but also the mucous membranes that line the upper regions of our respiratory tracts such as the nose. Such sprays would give us not only a motion detector ready to sense an intruder in an inner room of a building but also an alarm system that goes off the second the front door opens.</p>



<p>That type of alarm system isn’t a brand-new tool. For example, there is a nasal influenza vaccine available in the United States called FluMist, which teaches the body to recognize four different strains. And there is a similar one in Europe called Fluenz Tetra. Each flu virus included in these vaccines is weakened but can replicate in the body. The attenuated viruses grow best at<a href="https://www.cdc.gov/flu/prevent/nasalspray.htm"> cooler temperatures found in our noses</a>, not the warm environment of our lungs, a barrier that keeps them from making it to the lungs and causing influenza. But by taking off in the nose, replicating viruses kick off an immune response, so our bodies learn to set up reinforcements there.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Already<a href="https://www.thelancet.com/action/showPdf?pii=S2352-3964%2822%2900025-1"> roughly a dozen potential COVID-19 nasal vaccines have made it to clinical trials</a> around the world. One developed by a company called Altimmune was abandoned after <a href="https://ir.altimmune.com/news-releases/news-release-details/altimmune-announces-update-adcovidtm-phase-1-clinical-trial">early results showed the vaccine didn’t prompt a good immune response</a> in healthy participants. Others have<a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.05.16.492138v1"> shown promise when tested in animals</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The prospect of having nasal vaccines that may be able to curb transmission better than existing shots is understandably exciting. But these types of vaccines still have a way to go before hitting local pharmacies or doctors’ offices.</p>



<p>First, it’s crucial for the nasal vaccines to strike the right balance. Their sprays must be strong enough to provoke our immune systems, but still weak enough that there aren’t unwelcome symptoms or side effects. It’s also of course important to ensure the safety of vaccine candidates that include live, weakened viruses.&nbsp;</p>





<p>Some nasal vaccine candidates are similar to the influenza vaccine and include live, weakened viruses. Most of these viruses aren’t the coronavirus itself, but rather harmless-to-human viruses that sport one coronavirus protein for our bodies to recognize. Others may not need a virus to grow in the body to work. One team is developing a nasal spray that includes only the coronavirus spike protein, which helps the virus break into cells. That spike spray <a href="https://medicine.yale.edu/news-article/nasal-approach-to-covid-vaccination-gains-traction-at-yale/">could serve as a boost for people who received one of the mRNA vaccines</a>, coaxing important immune cells to come live in the nose and other parts of the respiratory tract. Once there, those immune cells would be poised to kick into high gear if the coronavirus invades.</p>



<p>Second, nasal sprays face the same problem as current COVID-19 vaccines. What happens when the virus evolves in ways that help it hide from our immune system? We’ve already seen the consequences of that thanks to the delta and omicron waves that raced around the globe. And from 2016 to 2018, FluMist <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/flu/prevent/nasalspray.htm">stumbled in the face of tweaked versions of some influenza viruses</a>. Experts recommended that people get a different type of flu shot in those seasons. Just as researchers are considering updating existing COVID-19 shots to better mimic the viral variants currently wreaking havoc, nasal vaccines may also need regular updating.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>If I had a choice, I would never catch coronavirus. But in the grand scheme of things, it’d be nice if a spray up my nose could drastically lower my chances of passing it on to someone else if I did get infected. If they make it to consumers, the nasal vaccines could make future COVID-19 waves much smaller than they are now. And after more than two years of navigating ever-larger waves, wouldn’t that be nice?</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/vortex-smoke-ring-light">Scientists created ‘smoke rings’ of light</a></h4>

              
                <p>Smoke rings are being seen in a new light.</p>



<p>Doughnut-shaped structures called vortex rings are sometimes seen swirling through fluids. Smokers can form them with their mouths, volcanoes can spit them out during eruptions and dolphins can blow them as bubble rings. Now, scientists can create the rings with light.</p>



<p>A standard vortex is <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/vortex-gets-tied-knots">an eddy</a> in a liquid or gas, like a whirlpool (<em>SN: 3/5/13</em>). Imagine taking that swirling eddy, stretching it out and bending it into a circle and attaching it end-to-end. That’s a vortex ring. These rings travel through the liquid or gas as they swirl — for example, smoke rings float through the air away from a smoker’s head. In <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41566-022-01013-y">the new vortex rings</a>, described June 2 in <em>Nature Photonics</em>, light behaves similarly: The flow of energy swirls as the ring moves.</p>





<p>Optics researcher Qiwen Zhan and colleagues started from a vortex tube, a hurricanelike structure they already knew how to create using laser light. The team used optics techniques to bend the tube into a circular shape, creating a vortex ring.</p>



<p>The light rings aren’t that different from smoke or bubble rings, says Zhan, of the University of Shanghai for Science and Technology. “That’s kind of cool.”</p>



<p>Zhan is interested in seeing whether scientists could create vortex rings out of electric current or a magnetic field. And further study of the light rings might help scientists better understand how topology — the geometry of doughnuts, knots and similar shapes — affects light and how it interacts with matter.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2022/06/10/heres-how-our-visual-system-decides-how-cute-a-baby-is/">Here’s how our visual system decides how cute a baby is</a></h4>

              
                <p><em>By</em>&nbsp;<a href="https://emmayoung.net/">Emma Young</a></p>



<p>What makes one baby seem cuter than another (parental bias aside)? Large and round eyes, a small nose and mouth, a high and protruding forehead, chubby cheeks and soft skin have all been associated with cuteness, not just in <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2011/07/07/men-are-as-motivated-by-cute-baby-faces-as-women/">babies</a> but <a href="https://www.sciencefocus.com/nature/why-do-we-find-puppies-so-cute/">puppies</a>, kittens, dolls and Japanese anime and manga characters. But now a <a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2022-53880-001">new paper</a> in <em>Emotion</em> suggests that another factor has an impact: the &#8220;spatial frequency&#8221; of what we see.</p>



<span id="more-46387"></span>



<p>Our visual system uses spatial frequencies to rapidly process variations in relative light and dark in an image. &#8220;Low&#8221; spatial frequencies convey coarse information — the location of a dark eye against pale skin, for example. &#8220;High&#8221; spatial frequencies convey fine detail such as edges. But other frequencies are important, too; research shows that medium spatial frequencies are most useful for recognising faces, for example. Spatial frequency (SF) processing is the basic mechanism for visual analysis, write Mengni Zhou at Okayama University, Japan, and colleagues. “Therefore understanding the effect of SFs is essential for a better understanding of the processing of cuteness,” they argue.</p>



<p>The team first asked 32 participants from Okayama University to rate the cuteness of 40 black and white images of infant faces (aged up to one). Using these ratings, the researchers assembled a set of four faces from the bottom cuteness quartile. They did the same for the second, third and top cuteness quartiles, generating a total of four sets. (Fourteen of the infants were identified as ‘Caucasian’, one ‘Asian’ and one ‘Indian’).  The team then manipulated the spatial frequency of each of the faces, generating four filtered versions, ranging from low to high SF. </p>

From <a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2022-53880-001">Zhou et al (2022)</a></figcaption></figure></div>


<p>In the next stage of the study, a fresh group of 30 students from the same university used a 7-point scale to rate each of these filtered images, as well as the originals, for cuteness.</p>



<p>As the team expected, the unfiltered original photos got higher cuteness ratings than their filtered versions. But within the filtered versions, some were seen as cuter than others.</p>



<p>The analysis showed that faces with the lowest SF always got the lowest cuteness ratings. When the team talked to participants after the study, some said that these faces looked “eyeless with dark empty orbits.” These versions were seen as “distasteful, even scary,” the team writes</p>



<p>In comparison with low SF, faces with medium and high SF got relatively high cuteness ratings. This is probably because the facial features associated with cuteness (small nose, chubby cheeks, etc) are more obvious at relatively high spatial frequencies, the team notes.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But when the cuteness of the <em>unfiltered</em> faces was high, the medium SF versions got better ratings than the high SF versions. This might relate to earlier findings that medium SFs are most important for facial recognition, the team suggests. &#8220;One possible explanation is that the processing mechanism of positive cuteness&#8221; — i.e. finding a baby’s face definitely cute — &#8220;is strongly related to face identity,&#8221; they suggest.</p>



<p>“In the future, eye tracking and neuroimaging studies are also necessary to verify these results and explore the mechanism of cuteness processing in depth,” they add. For now, though, the team argues that this work provides “direct evidence that the perception of infant facial cuteness is affected by SF information”.</p>



<p>It’s hard to see how this finding might have any real world impacts — except perhaps in the production of cartoon, manga and anime characters. My own kids enjoy manga and anime. I — no doubt like the participants in this study, who were all at a Japanese university — am well aware of <a href="https://www.ranker.com/list/cutest-anime-characters/anna-lindwasser">anime caricatures of cuteness</a>. But perhaps SF could be manipulated to influence our perceptions of a character’s cuteness, too. </p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/asteroid-ryugu-ryugu-hayabusa2-meteorite-sample-carbonaceous-chondrite">Samples of the asteroid Ryugu are scientists’ purest pieces of the solar system</a></h4>

              
                <p>Samples of the asteroid Ryugu are the most pristine pieces of the solar system that scientists have in their possession.</p>



<p>A new analysis of Ryugu material confirms the <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/asteroid-ryugu-texture-instant-coffee">porous rubble-pile asteroid</a> is rich in carbon and finds it is extraordinarily primitive (<em>SN: 3/16/20</em>). It is also a <a href="http://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.abn7850">member of a rare class of space rocks</a> known as CI-type, researchers report online June 9 in <em>Science</em>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Their analysis looked at material from the Japanese mission Hayabusa2, which collected 5.4 grams of dust and small rocks from <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/hayabusa2-touchdown-asteroid-ryugu-second-sample-subsurface">multiple locations</a> on the surface of Ryugu and <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/japan-hayabusa2-asteroid-dirt-sample-clues-early-solar-system">brought that material to Earth</a> in December 2020 (<em>SN: 7/11/19</em>; <em>SN: 12/7/20</em>). Using 95 milligrams of the asteroid’s debris, the researchers measured dozens of chemical elements in the sample and then compared abundances of several of those elements to those measured in rare meteorites classified as CI-type chondrites. Fewer than 10 meteorites found on Earth are CI chondrites.</p>





<p>This comparison confirmed Ryugu is a CI-type chondrite. But it also showed that unlike Ryugu, the meteorites appear to have been altered, or contaminated, by Earth’s atmosphere or even human handling over time. “The Ryugu sample is a much more fresh sample,” says Hisayoshi Yurimoto, a geochemist at Hokkaido University in Sapporo, Japan.</p>



<p>The researchers also measured the abundances of manganese-53 and chromium-53 in the asteroid and determined that melted water ice reacted with most of the minerals around 5 million years after the solar system’s start, altering those minerals, says Yurimoto. That water has since evaporated, but those altered minerals are still present in the samples. By studying them, the researchers can learn more about the asteroid’s history. &nbsp;</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/quantum-physics-machine-learning-google-computer">Quantum physics exponentially improves some types of machine learning</a></h4>

              
                <p>Machine learning can get a boost from quantum physics.</p>



<p>On certain types of machine learning tasks, <a href="http://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.abn7293">quantum computers have an exponential advantage</a> over standard computation, scientists report in the June 10 <em>Science</em>. The researchers proved that, according to quantum math, the advantage applies when using machine learning to understand quantum systems. And the team showed that the advantage holds up in real-world tests.</p>



<p>“People are very excited about the potential of using quantum technology to improve our learning ability,” says theoretical physicist and computer scientist Hsin-Yuan Huang of Caltech. But it wasn’t entirely clear if machine learning could benefit from quantum physics in practice.</p>





<p>In certain machine learning tasks, scientists attempt to glean information about a quantum system — say a molecule or a group of particles — by performing repeated experiments, and analyzing data from those experiments to learn about the system. </p>



<p>Huang and colleagues studied several such tasks. In one, scientists aim to discern properties of the quantum system, such as the position and momentum of particles within. Quantum data from multiple experiments could be input into a quantum computer’s memory, and the computer would process the data jointly to learn the quantum system’s characteristics.</p>



<p>The researchers proved theoretically that doing the same characterization with standard, or classical, techniques would require exponentially more experiments in order to learn the same information. Unlike a classical computer, a quantum computer can exploit entanglement — ethereal quantum linkages — to better analyze the results of multiple experiments.</p>



<p>But the new work goes beyond just the theoretical. “It’s crucial to understand if this is realistic, if this is something we could see in the lab or if this is just theoretical,” says Dorit Aharonov of Hebrew University in Jerusalem, who was not involved with the research.</p>



<p>So the researchers tested machine learning tasks with <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/google-quantum-computer-supremacy-claim">Google’s quantum computer</a>, Sycamore (<em>SN: 10/23/19</em>). Rather than measuring a real quantum system, the team used simulated quantum data, and analyzed it using either quantum or classical techniques.</p>



<p>Quantum machine learning won out there, too, even though Google’s quantum computer is noisy, meaning errors can slip into calculations. Eventually, scientists plan to build quantum computers that can <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/quantum-computers-hype-supremacy-error-correction-problems">correct their own errors</a> (<em>SN: 6/22/20</em>). But for now, even without that error correction, quantum machine learning prevailed.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/antarctic-glaciers-antarctica-pine-island-melting-climate-change-global-warming">Ancient penguin bones reveal unprecedented shrinkage in key Antarctic glaciers</a></h4>

              
                <p>Antarctica’s Pine Island and Thwaites glaciers are losing ice more quickly than they have at any time in the last few thousand years, ancient penguin bones and limpet shells suggest.</p>



<p>Scientists are worried that the glaciers, two of Antarctica’s fastest-shrinking ones, are in the process of unstable, runaway retreat. By <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41561-022-00961-y">reconstructing the history of the glaciers</a> using the old bones and shells, researchers wanted to find out whether these glaciers have ever been smaller than they are today.</p>





<p>“If the ice has been smaller in the past, and did readvance, that shows that we’re not necessarily in runaway retreat” right now, says glacial geologist Brenda Hall of the University of Maine in Orono. The new result, described June 9 in <em>Nature Geoscience,</em> “doesn’t give us any comfort,” Hall says. “We can’t refute the hypothesis of a runaway retreat.”</p>



<p>Pine Island and Thwaites glaciers sit in a broad ocean basin shaped like a bowl, deepening toward the middle. This makes <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/climate-thwaites-glacier-under-ice-shelf-risks-warm-water">the ice vulnerable to warm currents</a> of dense, salty water that hug the ocean floor (<em>SN: 4/9/21</em>). Scientists have speculated that as the glaciers retreat  farther inland, they could <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/antarctica-thwaites-glacier-ice-shelf-collapse-climate-5-years">tip into an irreversible collapse</a> (<em>SN: 12/13/21</em>). &nbsp;That collapse could play out over centuries and raise the sea level by roughly a meter.</p>

<p>To reconstruct how the glaciers have changed over thousands of years, the researchers turned to old penguin bones and shells, collected by Scott Braddock, a glacial geologist in Hall’s lab, during a research cruise in 2019 on the U.S. icebreaker <em>Nathaniel B. Palmer</em>.</p>



<p>One afternoon, Braddock clambered from a bobbing inflatable boat onto the barren shores of Lindsey 1 — one of a dozen or more rocky islands that sit roughly 100 kilometers from where Pine Island Glacier terminates in the ocean. As he climbed the slope, his boots slipped over rocks covered in penguin guano and dotted with dingy white feathers. Then, he came upon a series of ridges — rocks and pebbles that were piled up by waves during storms thousands of years before — that marked ancient shorelines.</p>



<p>Twelve thousand years ago, just as the last ice age was ending, this island would have been entirely submerged in the ocean. But as nearby glaciers shed billions of metric tons of ice, the removal of that weight allowed Earth’s crust to spring up like a bed mattress — pushing Lindsey 1 and other nearby islands out of the water, a few millimeters per year.</p>



<p>As Lindsey 1 rose, a series of shorelines formed on the edges of the island — and then were lifted, one after another, out of reach of the waves. By measuring the ages and heights of those stranded shorelines, the researchers could tell how quickly the island had risen. Because the rate of uplift is determined by the amount of ice being lost from nearby glaciers, this would reveal how quickly Pine Island and Thwaites glaciers had retreated — and whether they had gotten smaller than they are today and then readvanced.</p>



<p>Braddock dug into the pebbly ridges, collecting ancient cone-shaped limpet shells and marble-sized fragments of penguin bones deposited when the shorelines formed. Back in Maine, he and his colleagues radiocarbon dated those objects to estimate the ages of the shorelines. Ultimately, the researchers dated nearly two dozen shorelines, spread across several islands in the region.</p>



<p>These dates showed that the oldest and highest beach formed 5,500 years ago. Since that time, up until the last few decades, the islands have risen at a steady rate of about 3.5 millimeters per year. This is far slower than the 20 to 40 millimeters per year that the land around Pine Island and Thwaites is currently rising, suggesting that the rate of ice loss from nearby glaciers has skyrocketed due to the onset of rapid human-caused warming, after thousands of years of relative stability.</p>



<p>“We’re going into unknown territory,” Braddock says. “We don’t have an analog to compare what’s going on today with what happened in the past.”</p>



<p>Slawek Tulaczyk, a glaciologist at the University of California, Santa Cruz, sees the newly dated shorelines as “an important piece of information.” But he cautions against overinterpreting the results. While these islands are 100 kilometers from Pine Island and Thwaites, they are less than 50 kilometers from several smaller glaciers — and changes in these closer glaciers might have obscured whatever was happening at Pine Island and Thwaites long ago. He suspects that Pine Island and Thwaites could still have retreated and then readvanced a few dozen kilometers: “I don’t think this study settles it.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/robotic-finger-human-skin-self-healing">Scientists grew living human skin around a robotic finger</a></h4>

              
                <p>The Terminator may be one step closer to reality.</p>



<p>Researchers at the University of Tokyo have built a robotic finger that, much like Arnold Schwarzenegger’s titular cyborg assassin, is <a href="https://www.cell.com/matter/fulltext/S2590-2385(22)00239-9">covered in living human skin</a>. The goal is to someday build robots that look like real people — albeit for more altruistic applications.</p>



<p>Super realistic-looking robots could more seamlessly interact with humans in medical care and service industries, say biohybrid engineer Shoji Takeuchi and his colleagues June 9 in <em>Matter</em>. (Whether cyborgs masked in living tissue would be more congenial or creepy is probably in the eye of the beholder.)</p>





<p>To cover the finger in skin, Takeuchi and colleagues submerged the robotic digit in a blend of collagen and human skin cells called dermal fibroblasts. The mixture settled into a base layer of skin, or dermis, covering the finger. The team then poured a liquid containing human keratinocyte cells onto the finger, which formed an outer skin layer, or epidermis. After two weeks, skin covering the finger measured a few millimeters thick — comparable to the thickness of human skin.</p>



<p>The lab-made skin was strong and stretchy enough to withstand the robotic finger bending. It could also heal itself: When researchers made a small cut on the robotic finger and covered it with a collagen bandage, the skin’s fibroblast cells merged the bandage with the rest of the skin within a week.</p>

<p>“This is very interesting work and an important step forward in the field,” says Ritu Raman, an MIT engineer who also builds machines with living components. “Biological materials are appealing because they can dynamically sense and adapt to their environments.” For instance, she’d like to see a future version of the living robot skin embedded with nerve cells to make robots more aware of their surroundings.</p>



<p>But a robot can’t wear this lab-grown skin suit out and about just yet, Raman notes. The skin-covered robotic finger spent most of its time soaking in sugar, amino acids and other ingredients that skin cells need to survive. A Terminator or other cyborg wearing this skin would have to bathe often in a broth of nutrients or use some other complex skin care routine.</p>

                <p><em>By guest blogger</em>&nbsp;<a href="https://twitter.com/E_Barratt">Emma L. Barratt</a></p>



<p>In many countries, including the United Kingdom and United States, people from non-White communities have been hardest hit by Covid-19. Those from non-White communities generally have less access to good healthcare, are more likely to be essential workers, and are more likely to die from Covid than their White counterparts.</p>



<p>And though many of us are aware of this, <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S027795362200257X">new research</a> suggests that within the White demographic, simply hearing the reasons for these facts may be enough to make Covid seem like less of a threat, and reduce support for public health measures.</p>



<span id="more-46380"></span>



<p>In the first study, the team from the University of Georgia, US, looked at how White US residents’ perception of Covid racial disparities was related to their fear of Covid and support for Covid-centric safety precautions.</p>



<p>In September 2020, the researchers asked 498 White adult participants across 48 US states whether they felt White people or people of colour were more impacted in terms of infection rates and deaths. The team also probed participants’ knowledge of systemic factors that created said disparities, asking the extent to which they agreed with several factual statements, such as “people of colour in the U.S. are less likely to have access to drive-through testing services (relative to White people), which increases the spread of COVID-19 among people of colour”.</p>



<p>The participants were then presented with several measures in a randomised order, which looked at their fear of Covid, support for safety precautions (such as wearing a mask and social distancing), intentions to socially distance from those of different races, and racial attitudes. Participants also provided demographic data.</p>



<p>Somewhat in line with the team’s expectations, those that perceived greater Covid disparities between races reported less fear of the disease, though no less endorsement of Covid-related public health measures. In contrast, those with more knowledge of the systemic factors responsible for these disparities showed increased fear of Covid, as well as more support for Covid-related safety precautions. Perhaps unsurprisingly, those who were more conservative were less likely to support Covid public health measures.</p>



<p>The team took these findings further in their second study, investigating whether exposure to information about Covid racial disparities might move the needle in similar ways. For this leg of their research, 1,505 newly recruited White participants were randomly presented with one of three articles. Two of these referred to racial disparities in Covid outcomes, only one of which provided an explanation: that these disparities were the product of long-standing healthcare inequalities. A control article didn’t mention racial disparities at all. Participants then completed the same measures as in study one, with the addition of a measure of empathy.</p>



<p>This study again showed that having more knowledge about racial disparities led to less concern about Covid. However, this effect seemed to be strongest for the group presented with information about the role of systemic issues in producing these disparities. Reduced concern in this group in turn led them to show less support for safety precautions. In essence, it seems as though the more the participants knew, the less they cared.</p>



<p>The authors speculate that explaining how Covid racial disparities are a product of enduring health inequalities affecting non-White communities may have made White participants feel that they were unlikely to be similarly affected. This psychological distance may be part of the problem.</p>



<p>In their paper, the team draws lines between several psychological factors that may also contribute to this surprising outcome. Firstly, when faced with a threatening health situation, people are likely to contrast their own situation with that of people more at risk as a method of coping, drawing distance between the two for comfort. Perceiving a group and their situation as psychologically distant from one’s own (i.e. an out-group rather than an in-group) can make threats facing other groups also seem distant from oneself, and therefore less of a threat. The combination of these factors is likely to leave White people with reduced empathy for members of those at-risk racial minorities, while also reducing engagement with public health precautions.</p>



<p>Future efforts to create practical strategies and programs which lessen these particular psychological quirks may prove important in future public health efforts. In the meantime, the authors believe that additional care should be taken when reporting on racial disparities during the pandemic, as fuelling this phenomenon may perpetuate inequalities and have damaging effects on public health behaviour.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/mental-health-care-workers-nonviolent-police-calls-crime-denver-star">How having health care workers handle nonviolent police calls may impact crime</a></h4>

              
                <p>For the last two years, a person acting erratically in downtown Denver has likely first encountered unarmed health care workers rather than police. That shift stems from the rollout of a program known as Support Team Assisted Response, or STAR, which sends a mental health clinician and paramedic to respond to certain 911 calls about nonviolent behavior.</p>



<p>The program, and others like it, aim to defuse the tensions that can arise when police officers confront civilians in distress. Critics of these experimental programs have suggested that such reduced police involvement could allow crime to flourish. Now, researchers have found that during its pilot phase, <a href="http://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.abm2106">the STAR program did not appear to lead to more violent crime</a>. And reports of minor crimes substantially decreased, the researchers conclude June 8 in <em>Science Advances</em>.</p>





<p>Much of that reduction occurred because the health responders <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/police-racial-bias-data-missing-flawed-nonevents">do not issue citations</a> or make arrests <em>(SN: 12/18/21</em>). But even that reduction in reported crime is beneficial, says economist Thomas Dee of Stanford University. “That person is getting health care instead of being arrested.”</p>



<p>Following the death of George Floyd at the hands of a white police officer and the subsequent rise of the Black Lives Matter movement in the summer of 2020, cities throughout the country have been rolling out programs like STAR. “We cannot police our way out of every social problem,” says Temitope Oriola, a sociologist at the University of Alberta in Edmonton, Canada. But so far there have been <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/police-reform-why-little-evidence-data-body-cameras-implicit-bias">few studies</a> of these programs’ effects on crime, let alone on the reduction of violence between police and the public (<em>SN: 7/9/20</em>).</p>



<p>Dee and Jayme Pyne, a sociologist also at Stanford, looked at the STAR program’s impact on crime reports. The duo investigated the program&#8217;s pilot phase, which ran from June to November 2020 and encompassed eight of the city’s 36 police precincts. Police officers and 911 operators in those eight precincts redirected calls for minor and non-dangerous complaints to STAR providers. These calls included concerns about trespassing, indecent exposure, intoxication and similar low-level offenses. During the six-month pilot, STAR providers responded to 748 calls, averaging roughly six incidents per eight-hour shift.</p>



<p>Dee and Pyne analyzed criminal offenses in all 36 precincts from December 2019 to November 2020. They then compared the change in crime rates in the eight precincts receiving STAR services with the change in crime rates in the other 28 precincts. The rate of violent crime remained unchanged across the board, including in the precincts where the STAR program was active, the researchers found. But there was a 34 percent drop in reports of minor offenses in the STAR precincts, from an average of about 84 offenses per month in each district to an average of about 56 citations.</p>



<p>The data also suggest that the actual level of minor crimes and complaints dropped too — that is, the drop wasn’t just due to a lack of reporting, the researchers say. Prior to the pilot, minor offenses in the eight precincts receiving STAR services resulted in an average of 1.4 citations per incident. So having health care workers rather than police respond to 748 such calls should generate roughly 1,000 fewer citations, the authors calculate. Instead, citations dropped by almost 1,400. Providing people in crisis with access to health services may be preventing them from reoffending, Dee says.</p>



<p>Research into these sorts of programs is crucial, says Michael Vermeer, a justice policy researcher with the RAND Corporation, a public policy research organization headquartered in Santa Monica, Calif. &nbsp;But he cautions against drawing firm conclusions from a single study launched at the onset of the COVID-19 crisis, which dramatically changed crime rates and patterns across the country. “They just got confounded by the pandemic,” Vermeer says.</p>



<p>Dee agrees that he and other researchers now need to replicate this study across more cities, and also scale up in Denver. The city has since expanded the STAR program beyond the initial pilot.</p>



<p>Even if researchers eventually find that STAR and similar programs don’t budge crime rates much, that doesn’t mean that the programs are unsuccessful, says sociologist Brenden Beck of the University of Colorado Denver. He points to the potential to save taxpayer dollars. Dee and Pyne estimate that a single offense processed through STAR costs about $150, compared with the roughly $600 it costs to process one through the criminal justice system.</p>



<p>What’s more, helping people having nonviolent mental health crises get help and stay out of jail lets these individuals hold onto their jobs and stay present in their family members’ lives, Beck says. “I would hope we as a research community move on to study the benefit of these programs not just in terms of crime but also in terms of human welfare.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/chemistry-pigments-paint-arsenic-yellow-rose-mignon-still-life">A pigment’s shift in chemistry robbed a painted yellow rose of its brilliance</a></h4>

              
                <p>The fading of a once-vibrant yellow rose reveals how the ravages of time and chemical alteration can dampen the visual power of a painting<em>.</em></p>



<p>Most of the flowers in Abraham Mignon’s 17th century painting <em>Still Life with Flowers and a Watch </em>seem to leap off the canvas. But one yellow rose, painted with arsenic sulfide–based orpiment pigment, is a flat, jarring element. That wasn’t Mignon’s intention: The rose lost its luster due to <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.abn6344">the chemical transformation of some of its original bright pigment into colorless lead arsenates</a>, researchers report June 8 in <em>Science Advances</em>.</p>





<p>Paintings conservator Nouchka De Keyser of the Rijksmuseum in Amsterdam and colleagues analyzed the rose using <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/marie-antoinette-letters-ink-analysis-hidden-words-censor">noninvasive techniques including X-ray fluorescence imaging</a> and X-ray powder diffraction (<em>SN: 10/1/21</em>). The team first mapped the lingering traces of arsenic, lead, calcium and other chemical elements in the layers of paint to reveal how Mignon carefully layered paint to create a nearly three-dimensional rose out of light and shadow.</p>



<p>The analyses also revealed two newer crystals on the rose containing both lead and arsenic. Called mimetite and schultenite, the crystals are the product of a series of chemical reactions. First, the reaction of orpiment with light created a highly mobile type of arsenic called arsenolite. That mobilized arsenolite then found its way to an underlying layer of lead white paint and chemically reacted with it to produce the mimetite and schultenite. The crystals lack the bright color of the orpiment — instead, they are colorless and flatten the flower’s appearance.</p>

Not only can such reconstructions reveal now-faded elements in other paintings — they might also appear in museums, allowing visitors a ghostly glimpse of a painting’s true past.</p>

                <p><em>By </em>Emily Reynolds</p>



<p>A new study has cast doubt on historic research suggesting that the season or month of someone’s birth is associated with an increased risk of certain mental health conditions.</p>



<p>The <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-022-10892-8">paper</a>, published in<em> Scientific Reports, </em>looks at symptoms of anxiety and depression among more than 70,000 older adults in Europe. And it finds that there is no relationship between when they were born and the likelihood that they experience anxiety or depression.</p>



<span id="more-46363"></span>



<p>A number of past studies have found a link between season of birth and mental health diagnoses: research <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8885042/#:~:text=Results%3A%20'Process'%20schizophrenia%2C,was%205.8%25%20for%20bipolar%20disorder.">has linked bipolar disorder and schizophrenia with birth month</a>, for example. Researchers have suggested that such links could arise from nutrient intake and disease exposure varying across the course of the year. However, evidence has been mixed and more recent studies have suggested that confounding factors, particularly socioeconomic background, has more to do with these diagnoses than month of birth.</p>



<p>To see whether season of birth does make a difference to mental health, the team used data from a survey of 72,370 older adults from across Europe, who had been asked questions on their health. Information gathered for this study included their month and season of birth (winter, spring, summer or autumn), and the extent to which they experienced symptoms of depression or anxiety.</p>



<p>Overall, there was no significant relationship between participants’ month of birth and symptoms of depression or anxiety. There was some variability in some countries — for example in Hungary and Poland, depressive symptoms fluctuated a little depending on birth month, and in the Czech Republic the same was true of anxiety symptoms — but, on the whole, there was no systematic pattern.</p>



<p>The team also compared younger and older participants (below and above the ages of 65), male and female participants, and those from different regions of Europe. And again, there was no meaningful effect of month of birth, regardless of how participants were split up.</p>



<p>As noted, previous research had suggested that season of birth had a strong association with mental health. This has largely been attributed to the impact of climate, differences in sunlight and vitamin D exposure, nutrition and other factors. The team suggests that an improvement in access to healthy food — and an understanding of the nutrients pregnant women and children need — may therefore be able to explain why there was no link between month of birth and mental health symptoms in this study.</p>



<p>The study, therefore, indicates that season of birth may not be a good predictor of mental health later in life. However, the social and environmental factors that potentially drove the links previously found between season of birth and mental health, such as nutrition and maternal health, are still worth considering when it comes to the physical and mental health of whole families.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/mosquito-sleep-deprivation-blood-disease">Mosquitoes prefer dozing over dining when they are sleep-deprived</a></h4>

              
                <p>Turns out there <em>is</em> rest for the wicked: Sleepy mosquitoes are more likely to catch up on missed z’s than drink blood, a new study finds.</p>



<p>Most people are familiar with the aftermath of a poor night’s sleep. Insects also suffer; for instance, drowsy honeybees struggle to perform their signature waggle dance, and weary fruit flies show signs of memory loss. In the case of sleep-deprived mosquitoes, they <a href="https://journals.biologists.com/jeb/article-abstract/225/11/jeb244032/275550/Behavioral-and-postural-analyses-establish-sleep">give up valuable time for feeding in favor of sleeping overtime</a>, researchers report June 1 in <em>Journal of Experimental Biology</em>.</p>





<p>The preference for dozing over dining is surprising given that “we know that mosquitoes love blood a lot,” says Oluwaseun Ajayi, a disease ecologist at the University of Cincinnati.</p>



<p>Scientists have long been interested in mosquitoes’ <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/cracking-body-clock-code-wins-trio-nobel-prize">circadian rhythms</a>, the internal clock that determines their sleep and awake times (<em>SN: 10/2/17</em>). Knowing when a mosquito is awake —&nbsp;and biting — is important for understanding and limiting disease transmission. For instance, malaria, often transmitted by nocturnal mosquitoes, is kept under control by slinging netting around beds. But new research suggests that <a href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2104282119">mosquitoes that feed during the day may also spread</a> the disease.</p>



<p>It’s challenging to study sleeping bloodsuckers in the lab. That’s partly because awake mosquitoes are aroused by the presence of a meal — the experimenter. And when mosquitoes do fall asleep, they look rather similar to peers that are merely resting to conserve energy.&nbsp;</p>



<p>That’s the tricky — and often species-specific — question: “How can you tell [when] an insect is sleeping?” says Samuel Rund, a mosquito circadian biologist at the University of Notre Dame in Indiana who was not involved in the research.</p>



<p>One way to tell is by tracking the insect’s behavior. So Ajayi and colleagues watched mosquitoes sleep. The team focused on three species known to carry diseases, including malaria: <em>Aedes aegypti</em>, which are active during the day; <em>Culex pipiens</em>, which prefer dusk; and the nocturnal <em>Anopheles stephensi</em>. The mosquitoes were left alone in a room in small enclosures, where the team used cameras and infrared sensors to spy on them.</p>



<p>After about two hours, the mosquitoes appeared to nod off. Their abdomens lowered to the ground and their hind legs drooped, the footage showed. As time went on, <em>C. pipiens </em>and <em>A. aegypti</em> showed a reduced response when the experimenter walked in the room, suggesting a tasty smell was less likely to wake those species when in a deep sleep. Taken together, the change in posture, periods of inactivity and lower arousal were determined to identify a snoozing mosquito.</p>



<p>What started as a relaxing experiment for the mosquitoes quickly changed gears. The insects were placed in clear tubes that received vibration pulses every few minutes, preventing them from falling into deep sleep. After four to 12 hours of this sleep deprivation, the team mimicked the presence of a host with a pad of heated artificial sweat. In another experiment, a plucky human volunteer offered up a leg to be fed on for five minutes by sleep-deprived and well-rested <em>A. aegypti </em>in batches of 10 insects.</p>



<p>In both cases, the mosquitoes that had had a full night’s rest were much more likely to land on the host than those that had been deprived of sleep. And the leg exposed to sleepy mosquitoes fared much better than when it was exposed to the control group: In eight tests, on average 77 percent of the well-rested mosquitoes went for a blood meal, compared with only 23 percent of sleepy mosquitoes.</p>



<p>The findings, Rund says, open avenues for research into controlling mosquito populations and reducing disease using the insects’ circadian rhythms.</p>

                <p>Written by <a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/author/lmorton/">Lindsay Morton</a></p>



<p>A year ago, in response to <a href="https://osf.io/f73a6/">community desire</a> for a strong position on code sharing, and in acknowledgement of the <a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2022/05/uphold-the-code/">immense value</a> that code adds to the scientific literature, <em>PLOS Computational Biology</em> introduced a new <a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2021/03/supporting-community-needs-with-an-enhanced-code-policy-on-plos-computational-biology/">code-sharing policy</a>. The policy requires that any code supporting a publication be shared (unless there are ethical or legal restrictions that prevent sharing).</p>



<p>Now, a new <a href="https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1010193">editorial</a> reports the results of an analysis of code-sharing behavior at the journal both before and after the policy implementation. The investigation found that, &ldquo;the rate of code sharing for research articles published in <em>PLOS Computational Biology</em> before the policy was implemented was 53% in 2019 and 61% in 2020. This rose to 73% for research articles published in 2021, which includes a high proportion of research articles that were submitted before the policy was implemented.&rdquo; When looking only at articles submitted after the introduction of the policy, the code-sharing rate is 87%. For comparison, it is estimated that more than 99.5% of research articles published in the journal between 2019 and 2022 generated code that supported the research presented.</p>

<p>This remarkable increase demonstrates the efficacy of a policy-based approach to code-sharing. &ldquo;These results show that the mandatory code sharing policy is such a great fit for the computational biology community. Many researchers were already showing great commitment to openness and transparency by voluntarily sharing code before the policy came into effect and now the policy just helps to cement this as the norm for the field.&rdquo; said Lauren Cadwallader, Open Research Manager at PLOS and one of the authors of the editorial.&nbsp;</p>

<p><a href="https://bookshop.org/a/21798/9780062951519">The Rise and Reign of the Mammals</a><br><em>Steve Brusatte</em><br><em>Mariner Books, $29.99</em></p>



<p>In my opinion, the most satisfying science documentary TV series ever made was a 1970s British production called <em>Connections</em>. Hosted by impish historian James Burke, wearing bell-bottoms and thick-framed tortoiseshell glasses, each episode revealed how one small innovation from earlier human civilizations led to another and then another and another, culminating in the invention of some ultramodern (for the 1970s) technology.</p>



<p>Watching these pieces of the past come together was deeply gratifying, if not a little dizzying. The present is so familiar that it feels inevitable. But it was striking to see modern civilization, even modern humans, in context, to recognize how all that we are now actually hinges on countless moments of invention, improvement and experimentation in the deep past.</p>





<p>I had a similar reaction to <em>The Rise and Reign of the Mammals</em>, paleontologist Steve Brusatte’s sweeping history of the animals that have, for the moment, inherited the Earth. Moving generally forward in time, the book describes how the mammalian line progressively acquired a range of features that have come to define what a mammal is.</p>



<p>Some of the moments of evolutionary invention that led to what we now think of as a mammal are remarkably subtle. There’s the hard roof of the mouth that created a dedicated airway to the lungs, allowing mammal ancestors to eat and breathe at the same time. There’s the change from a spine that bends from left to right (which produces the classically reptilian side-to-side gait) to one that enables bending up and down, which ultimately allowed mammals to take in more oxygen as they moved, helping them run faster. And there’s the variety of tooth shapes — incisors, canines, premolars and molars — that made it possible for mammals to eat many kinds of food. A reptile, by contrast, tends to have just one tooth type.</p>



<p>Some mammalian characteristics are very familiar: milk production, warm-bloodedness, hair. But there’s one less–well-known evolutionary advance that was in its humble way quite profound, setting “us apart from amphibians, reptiles, and birds,” Brusatte writes. It’s a <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/flexible-bone-helps-mammals-chew-dates-back-jurassic-period">joint in the jaw that makes chewing possible</a> (<em>SN: 8/17/19, p. 8</em>). The ability to chew was “a major evolutionary turning point,” he writes. “It triggered a domino chain of changes to mammalian feeding, intelligence, and reproduction.”</p>





<p>Brusatte also describes a second small, curious adaptation: the transformation of two bones in the reptile jaw, which migrated to the inner ear to become two members of a famous trio, the hammer and anvil (the third is the stirrup). These inner ear bones are the basis for yet another key mammalian feature: <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/ancient-critter-may-shed-light-when-mammals-middle-ear-evolved">the ability to hear a wide range of frequencies</a>, particularly in the upper register (<em>SN Online: 12/6/19</em>).</p>



<p>The story of the Age of Mammals is often told as the flip side to the dinosaurs’ demise. But the fossil record reveals that mammals were hardly newcomers: They arose around the same time as the dinosaurs, over 200 million years ago. Even during the Age of Dinosaurs, “in the smaller and hidden niches, it was already the Age of Mammals,” Brusatte writes. “Mammals were <em>better</em> than the dinosaurs at being small.”</p>



<p>Within just a few hundred thousand years of the asteroid impact that wiped out all nonbird dinos some 66 million years ago, mammals moved in to fill the vacancy, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/fossils-capture-mammals-recovery-after-dinosaur-killing-asteroid">rapidly getting a lot bigger</a>, ballooning from, say, mouse-sized to beaver-sized (<em>SN: 12/7/19, p. 32</em>). Pretty soon, they got a lot smarter too. In a geologic blink — a scant 10 million years — <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/mammal-big-bodies-small-brains-dinosaur-extinction-fossils">mammals’ brains caught up with their brawn</a>, and then the Age of Mammals was off to the races (<em>SN: 5/7/22 &amp; 5/21/22, p. 18</em>).</p>



<p>Paleontology narratives often require refocusing a story’s lens in a way that can be jarring, zooming out to encompass Earth-wide climate cataclysms and mass extinctions and then in again to describe tiny bones and obscure species. Brusatte, though, is a nimble storyteller and he’s chosen an engrossing story to tell.</p>



<p>As a science writer, I often find myself focusing on minute advances, studying tiny threads. So it’s satisfying to sit back and admire the full tapestry as presented in <em>The Rise and Reign of the Mammals</em>. Reading this book reminded me what I most enjoy about geology, paleontology and the evolution of life on Earth: This planet has got some epic stories.</p>
