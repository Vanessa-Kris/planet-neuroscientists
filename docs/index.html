Is peer review a good way to weed out problematic papers? And if it is, which kinds of peer review? In a new paper in Scientometrics, Willem Halffman, of Radboud University, and Serge Horbach, of Radboud University and Leiden University, used our database of retractions to try to find out. We asked them several questions about … <a class="more-link" href="http://retractionwatch.com/2018/12/20/which-kind-of-peer-review-is-best-for-catching-fraud/">Continue reading <span class="screen-reader-text">Which kind of peer review is best for catching fraud?</span></a>

Frontiers is a somewhat unconventional open access publisher, which likes to have it both ways: playing scientific elite while accepting almost anything from paying customers. My regular contributor Smut Clyde will tell you below how some anti-vaccine scare-mongers managed to sneak in some rather dangerous works thanks to Frontiers' unofficial "we don't judge, we just charge" quasi-policy.

So, any infant born between 23 and 37 weeks gestation is considered premature and many of these infants are hospitalized in the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU) until they reach the equivalent of 37 weeks gestational age. The organ systems of these infants are not fully developed, and, the more premature, the less developed.

<h4>Time to torch the textbooks</h4><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*v489KmVg2nP9MDfsu9i3pw.png" /></figure><p>Welcome all to the third annual review of the year in neuroscience from The Spike. We’ve made it to the end of 2018. Who saw that coming?</p><p>Which means it’s time to take stock, and admire the great strides we’ve made in understanding the brain this year. Pfft. There, done that. Now for the actual review, this year a sampling of three pieces of beautiful or provocative work that shows us we understand less than we thought.</p><h4>1/ Neurons “transmit” RNA</h4><p>January started with a bang: Jason Shepherd and his team <a href="https://www.cell.com/cell/fulltext/S0092-8674(17)31504-0?_returnURL=https%3A%2F%2Flinkinghub.elsevier.com%2Fretrieve%2Fpii%2FS0092867417315040%3Fshowall%3Dtrue">published a paper </a>showing that messenger RNA (mRNA) is transmitted between neurons. I’ll say right upfront that molecular biology is not one of my strengths. But then neither is elephant juggling, and I gave that a damn good try until the hernia. And the findings in this paper are so outlandish that if you missed it then, you need to know about it know.</p><p>It all starts with the Arc gene, and the protein it encodes. We know Arc is needed for learning. Delete the Arc gene in mice and learning is screwed. The Arc gene shows up in those big fishing expeditions for genes related to disorders of learning and development. And for once we even know something about what the Arc protein does — it’s involved in building synapses, possibly by moving AMPA receptors into position.</p><p>So far, so genetics. The Arc gene is read-out by a string of Arc mRNA, which in turn specifies an Arc protein, and the Arc protein alters synapses. A lot of mechanism, but no function. That mucking about with a gene that affects synapses in turn affects learning is a bit of no-brainer. We already know a lot about when and why synapses between neurons get weaker or stronger; knowing this gene-to-protein pathway gives us a better understanding of how synapses get stronger or weaker, but doesn’t tell us a lot more about the why or when. As systems neuroscientists we only get out of bed for something that tells us about how neurons talk to each other.</p><p>It turns out neurons can talk to each other using Arc. I’m out of bed now.</p><p>The Shepherd lab’s paper in January showed that the Arc protein makes a virus-like shell, and inside this shell is wrapped Arc’s own mRNA — the mRNA that encodes the protein itself. This shell is then in turn shoved in the kind of bag — a vesicle — that neurons use to transmit stuff to each other at synapses. Except this type of vesicle isn’t released at a synapse, its simply released from wherever on the neuron’s skin it happened to form.</p><p>The big question the Shepherd lab then faced down was: if this bag containing a bit of Arc’s mRNA is released outside the neuron, does it get taken up by other neurons? And if it does get taken up, what does it do? They tackled this in a really elegant way. Take a bunch of neurons in a dish that have no Arc in them, as it’s been knocked-out. Then dump some of those Arc mRNA filled bags into that dish, special ones that have been altered to glow. And watch: do the glowing bags end up inside the neurons? Yes, they did.</p><p>And the clincher was when Shepherd’s team then looked inside these Arc-less neurons, now filled with glowing bags, and found huge quantities of the Arc protein. The mRNA had been taken up, and proteins manufactured from it.</p><p>The ramifications of this work are potentially huge. For one thing, we have this startling evidence of non-canonical transmission between neurons. But more important is what was transmitted: this is a neuron sending a recipe for how to construct a protein to another neuron. A protein that is heavily involved in controlling learning. We now have evidence that internal instructions to change one neuron’s synapses can be sent to other nearby neurons, and potentially change theirs too. Understanding how neurons learn just got a whole lot more complicated.</p><p>Oh, and <a href="https://www.cell.com/cell/fulltext/S0092-8674(17)31502-7">the same thing happens in flies too</a>.</p><h4>2/ Who watches the watch-people?</h4><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*j9etcIMb-wa1qU5JqSKo3w.png" /></figure><p>Say I was the annoying kind of father who doled out sweets one at a time in a slow tedious game for my own amusement. I’ve got a bowl of sweets and grapes all mixed together, and a 5 year old who would very much like a sweet, actually daddy. So the game goes as follows — I look in the bowl, and pick something out and show it to the irritated child. With my left hand I always take and show a grape, with my right hand a chocolate; I repeat that pick-and-show a few times to hammer home the message. Then I pick one item in each fist so they can’t see, and ask my 5 year old to choose a hand to open. Which would they pick? Right hand, yes?</p><p>But if I then put both hands in the bowl without looking in the bowl, which would they pick? If my 5 year old understood how the world works, then they now know that I was not able to see what I chose — so they should pick a hand at random. Or yell for mummy to get daddy to pack in this idiotic game.</p><p>To pick a hand, the 5 year old needs some pretty advanced knowledge of what others know — a model of the world that includes inferring what others themselves know about the world.</p><p><a href="https://www.cell.com/current-biology/fulltext/S0960-9822(18)30549-9?_returnURL=https%3A%2F%2Flinkinghub.elsevier.com%2Fretrieve%2Fpii%2FS0960982218305499%3Fshowall%3Dtrue">Work by Johanna Eckert and colleagues</a> this year showed chimps have exactly this knowledge — about humans.</p><p>Each chimp had to deal with two such annoying humans. Two buckets were in view, both mixes of carrots and peanuts; one heavy on the carrots, one heavy on the peanuts. The buckets were transparent, so the chimp could see which was carrot-heavy, and which peanut-heavy. The humans deliberately picked the rare options: Human 1 picked peanuts from the carrot-heavy bucket; Human 2 picked carrots from the peanut-heavy bucket. Each showed these picks to the chimp.</p><p>After showing this a few times, and presumably as the chimp grew tired of these annoying humans and their tedious game, then came the test. On some trials, the humans looked in the bucket as they were picking. On other trials, the could not see the bucket, and picked blindly. The chimp could see all this. On each trial it was offered both fists, and asked to choose one. Which did it choose?</p><p>The tension here is between the chimp’s knowledge of what is in the buckets, and the knowledge of what the humans know. The chimp knows which bucket is full of carrots (ugh) and which is full of peanuts (woohoo!). But it may also know that Human 1 keeps picking peanuts from the carrot bucket, and Human 2 irritatingly picks carrots from the peanut bucket. So if it knew this, then the chimp should choose the fist of Human 1 and collect its peanut.</p><p>Ah, but wait: if Humans 1 and 2 did not look into the bucket, then surely it was more likely that Human 1 now has a carrot and Human 2 now has a peanut, because that’s what their buckets were filled with. In which case, the chimp should choose the fist of Human 2, as they were more likely to have a peanut.</p><p>Amazingly, the chimps worked all this out. On trials where the humans looked into the buckets, the chimps chose the fist of Human 1 — the peanut picker — vastly more often than chance. On trials where the humans could not see into the buckets, and picked at random, the chimps chose the fist of Human 2 more often. The chimps’ choices reflected not only their knowledge of the world, but also what they inferred the humans knew about the world. And used this knowledge to adjust the probability of their decisions.</p><p>Face it, a chimp is a better statistician than you.</p><h4>3/ Misplaced childhood</h4><p>You remember when you were one, charging about the place with a very full nappy (diaper, if you insist), slipped, and landed so hard on your bum that the nappy lost containment and the resulting pooh tsunami covered Grandma? No? Well, that’s because of infant amnesia — we lay down no long term memories of our early childhood.</p><p>Infant amnesia seems fairly self-evident: we cannot remember anything about our early childhood, so there must be no memory stored in our brain. Or is it? For what if instead we simply can’t access the memories. <a href="https://www.cell.com/current-biology/fulltext/S0960-9822(18)30695-X?_returnURL=https%3A%2F%2Flinkinghub.elsevier.com%2Fretrieve%2Fpii%2FS096098221830695X%3Fshowall%3Dtrue">Work from Paul Frankland’s lab</a>, led by Axel Guskjolen, has now shown us that actually there may well memories of your infancy still in there somewhere.</p><p>Mice can’t remember stuff from their early childhood either. Frankland’s lab showed this by testing a mouse’s memory for fear of a bad place — put a mouse in a special box, apply a mild electric shock, repeat a couple of times. Then next day put it back in that box, and the mouse freezes, remembering the box, what it means, and anticipating a shock.</p><p>Do this to adult mice — 60 days old — and that memory lasts for more than 90 days. They freeze just as much if put back into the box after 90 days as they do after one day — even if they’ve never seen the box in the intervening 89 days. They have a clear memory of the bad place that lasts for longer than they’d been alive when they first saw it. Pretty convincing long-term memory.</p><p>But do this to infant mice — 14 days old — and all memory of the bad place is gone by 15 days later. Put them back in the box after 30 days, say, and no freezing at all. Is the memory gone, or hidden?</p><p>We know that the hippocampus is strongly involved in these kinds of place memories. So it’s a great candidate for finding the memory of the bad place. Frankland’s lab took the elegant approach of injecting into the hippocampus a gene that tags neurons when they are active. The idea here was that neurons laying down the memory during training in the bad place will be most active, so will be the most strongly tagged. The crucial part is that the tagging causes the neurons to express a light-sensitive ion channel. Then if you were to later shine a laser into that same part of hippocampus, the laser will re-activate just those tagged neurons. In theory, re-activating whatever those neurons represent.</p><p>Frankland’s lab did just this in their 14 day old mice: tagged the active neurons while training them to learn about the bad place. When they put them back in the box after 15 days, they did not freeze, showing no memory, as expected. But then the laser in hippocampus was switched on: and the mice froze. Just as though re-activating the tagged neurons switched on a lost memory of the bad place.</p><p>As with all good scientists, the team did a lot of control experiments to make this convincing. They turned the laser on without tagging the neurons, and no freezing. They tagged the neurons, but only turned the laser on in other locations, like their cage, not the special box: and no freezing. This control is actually very important. Activating so many neurons in hippocampus at the same time could cause an epilepsy-like absence seizure, where the mice would freeze in place. But as the freezing was only in the bad place, and not wherever the laser was switched on, that’s pretty convincing evidence that freezing in the bad place wasn’t just a seizure.</p><p>Activating the tagged neurons still worked after 30 days between training and testing. It worked after 60 days. An infant mouse’s memory of what happened in the bad place could be turned back on at will. It was there, but they could not access it. Which opens up the slightly worrying idea that infant amnesia is not the erasure of memory, but the hiding of memory.</p><h4>Plan S</h4><p>If we’re going to discuss science in 2018, I suppose we have to mention <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plan_S">Plan S</a>. A bold plan to get published works from across the European Union freely and immediately available for all to read. And to do get the plan launched in a mere couple of years. A worthy idea, but one that caused no end of arguing.</p><p>From one perspective, this is a long-needed action, whether you believe that science paid for by taxpayers should be available to those taxpayers, or that the vast profits of scientific publishing houses are obscene. From another perspective, this is a draconian laying down of the law, with a narrow, muddled view of what constitutes open-access (no pre-prints, no free access with a short delay), and little thought for institutions that depend on revenue from publishing journals for their existence (such as learned societies). Who is right?</p><p>Everyone, of course. We need a Plan S of some kind; the version we got was not thought through well enough before being announced. Prioritising paid-for open-access over all others risks giving more, not less, power to established publishers. And I saw strangely little discussion of the UK’s long experience with our own version of Plan S: we’ve had mandated gold open-access publication of work funded by our Research Councils since 2014, when a central fund was established to pay for it (and the Wellcome Trust made a similar mandate with their own money). Each university is given its share of this central fund each year, with a simple mission: pay for each paper funded by the Research Councils to be published “open to all”.</p><p>Result? With no caps on how much journals will charge to publish an open-to-all paper, this costs an absolute fortune . The funds held by each university are rapidly run down each financial year. To stem the flood, some universities put their own local rules in place about what kinds of paper will qualify for funding (e.g. no funds for hybrid journals) so there are big inconsistencies between universities in how they implement this apparently simple policy. Worse, some universities simply run out of funding, and turn down the mandated requests for pay for papers. In short, an expensive mess.</p><p>I look forward to the Plan S architects answering the simple question: if implemented, where will people publish when the money runs out?</p><h4><strong>Hey, 2018 wasn’t all bad.</strong></h4><p>We had Peter Dayan and Demis Hassabis elected as Fellows of the Royal Society, in recognition of their ground-breaking work in artificial intelligence and neuroscience. <a href="http://www.mousemotorlab.org/deeplabcut/">DeepLabCut </a>brought automated, general purpose movement tracking to the masses.<br />We got compelling evidence that the tiny groups of mid-brain neurons housing the brain’s key neuromodulators are home to extraordinary diversity, in a flurry of papers within what seemed a week of each other, on <a href="https://www.cell.com/cell/fulltext/S0092-8674(18)30971-1#.W3_cq2FUTcg.twitter">serotonin</a>, on <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41593-018-0203-4">dopamine</a>, and on <a href="https://www.cell.com/neuron/fulltext/S0896-6273(18)30635-4">noradrenaline</a>.</p><p>Hugo Spiers and colleagues <a href="https://www.cell.com/current-biology/fulltext/S0960-9822(18)30771-1">showed us</a> that the difference in navigation ability between the men and women of a country correlates rather stunningly well with the level of gender inequality in that country: the more unequal the genders are treated, the bigger the gap in the ability to navigate. To the extent that countries with minor gender inequality — your Norways and your Finlands — show no difference in navigation ability between men and women.</p><p>And it would be remiss of me not to mention that <a href="https://medium.com/the-spike">The Spike</a> itself had an exciting year, as it morphed from one-man show to a platform for a rich variety of voices in systems neuroscience.

A paper about the role of hippocampus in memory. Unlike most strange papers, this one was strange for what was <strong>not</strong> in it. No flashy genetics; no tricksy optogenetics to make neurons do unworldly things; no DREADDs to control specific neurons with designer chemicals; no Neuropixels or calcium imaging to record hundreds or thousands of neurons; no unit recording of any kind, in fact. Just behaviour, chemical lesions for causality, and EEG/LFP to track sleep states. Like something from the late 80s. As were the statistical analyses (seriously <em>Nature</em>, bar charts with single sided error bars in 2018?).</p><p>But it made an interesting case for scientific insight, and there it is, in <em>Nature</em>. Freak occurrence, or turning point to prizing scientific insight over flash? Onwards to 2019 to find out. See you there!</p><p><em>Want more?

<p>End of year festivities are now in full swing with our focus on friends, family and food. In this blog, I look at how diet can affect your mental health, and share some healthy eating tips to get you through the silly season without the mood swings and guilt.</p>
<h2>Does diet affect mental health?</h2>
<p>If you’re in a negative mood, you’re more likely to choose indulgent, comfort foods that are sugary, fatty or salty instead of opting for nutritious options.</p>
<p>We have anecdotal evidence to support the notion that how you feel affects the foods you choose to eat.</p>
<p>Until recently, what was less understood was the causal relationship between food and how it affected mood.</p>
<h2>The SMILES trial – evidence at last!</h2>
<p>Associate Professor Felice Jacka, Deakin University researcher and founder of the International Society for Nutritional Psychiatry, and her team have recently conducted a small <a href="https://bmcmedicine.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12916-017-0791-y">clinical trial</a> of 67 people suffering symptoms of depression and found a link between diet and their mental health.</p>
<p>In the study, half of the participants were encouraged to follow a Modified Mediterranean Diet, which was constructed using existing dietary guidelines from Greece and Australia, <em>traditional</em> Mediterranean diet principles. Everyone was coached by a dietician. A comparison group of people with the same symptoms, were offered social support only.</p>
<p>The results of the <a href="https://foodandmoodcentre.com.au/media/smiles-trial/">SMILES study,</a> published in the international journal <em>BMC Medicine</em>, showed that participants in the dietary intervention group had a much greater reduction in their depressive symptoms over the three-month period, compared to those in the social support group.</p>
<p>At the end of the trial, a third of those in the dietary support group met criteria for remission of major depression, compared to 8 percent of those in the social support group.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.abc.net.au/radionational/programs/rnfirstbite/diet-for-mental-health/5802234" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Jacka says</a>,</p>
<blockquote><p>“Research now suggests that depression and dementia are affected by the quality of our diets across the life course. Research also shows that adults who eat more unhealthy junk foods are at increased risk of depression.”</p></blockquote>
<p>This is also the case in teenagers.</p>
<blockquote><p>“We see a pretty clear dose-response relationships between their diet and level of mental health and wellbeing. In particular, those that had low scores on what we call an unhealthy dietary pattern were worse off, and those who had a higher score on the nutrient-dense dietary pattern were better off.”</p></blockquote>
<h2>What foods should I choose to improve mood?</h2>
<p>The ‘bad-mood food’ culprits are what you might expect. As Jacka <a href="http://www.abc.net.au/health/talkinghealth/factbuster/stories/2014/10/02/4098166.htm" rel="noopener" target="_blank">explains</a>,</p>
<blockquote><p>“Highly-processed snack and takeaway food products, rich in tasty fat and sugar, have now displaced much of the fruit, vegetables and other nutritious, unprocessed foods in our diets.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Healthy, nutrient-dense dietary patterns, such as the Mediterranean diet, seem to protect against developing depression, and also dementia. Jacka says,</p>
<blockquote><p>“The strongest evidence-base we have is for the Mediterranean diet, and it is what we should be advocating for everyone.”</p></blockquote>
<p>A Mediterranean type diet (which is <em>not</em> red wine based!) is characterised by high consumption of plants (vegetables, fruits, legumes, nuts, and whole grains), is rich in healthy fats from generous consumption of fish and olive oil, is low in red meat and dairy, and allows for moderate consumption of red wine with meals.</p>
<h2>Tips for healthy eating over the festive season.</h2>
<p>Tis the season to be jolly!</p>
<p>Here are some easy brain-healthy choices you can make to keep you feeling joyful at your next BBQ or end of year party:</p>
<ul>
<li>Instead of only snacking on chips, try a few raw nuts too (just not the salted and roasted kind!).</li>
<li>Load up your plate with salad or veggies first — you’ll leave less room for meat, bread or potatoes.</li>
<li>Swap the BBQ lamb chop or steak for salmon. Omega-3 fats in fish reduce inflammation, which may contribute to an increased risk of depression or anxiety.</li>
<li>Add some legumes (beans, chickpeas or lentils) to your plate. Your gut will love the extra fibre, and evidence is building that a healthy gut microbiome is linked to better mental health.</li>
<li>High-quality extra-virgin olive oil seasoned with balsamic vinegar is delicious for dipping wholegrain bread, and is a healthy alternative to butter or margarine.</li>
<li>Enjoy prawns and turkey. Both are rich in tryptophan an essential amino acid that is the precursor for the neurotransmitter (brain chemical) serotonin.</li>
<li>Swap the pavlova for fresh fruit (or at least choose both!). Or, if you must indulge, save the sweet treats for a special occasion like Christmas day.</li>
<li>Cheers! Enjoy a glass of red wine with friends and family. Social connection is one of the best protective factors against mental health problems and cognitive decline.</li>
</ul>

Are current classification systems for research misconduct adequate?

In a new paper in Accountability in Research, Kuroki — who has published on research misconduct before … <a class="more-link" href="http://retractionwatch.com/2018/12/17/is-it-time-for-a-new-classification-system-for-scientific-misconduct/">Continue reading <span class="screen-reader-text">Is it time for a new classification system for scientific misconduct?</span></a>

Ego depletion is one of the most well-known concepts in social psychology. A recent study can’t confirm an old one showing it exists.  Who is right? Probably everyone.

This time last year I wrote(1,2) about a Swedish company called Emotra. Emotra make a device that is supposed to measure suicide risk in people with mental illness. The test is called EDOR® and according to Emotra's website and materials, it has been shown to be highly effective. Last year, I explained why I disagree with that assessment.



Now, a year later, I'm revisting the EDOR® story, because there have been a number of developments that I find quite disturbing. It seems that EDOR® has

<p>Psychologists, philosophers and poets have devoted many years reflecting on the meaning of love for another. A less-explored question – the focus of <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/0265407517724600">a study</a> to appear in the January 2019 issue of <em>Journal of Social and Personal Relationships</em> – is what makes us feel loved by others?</p>
<p>More specifically, the study investigated whether there is widespread agreement about the everyday experiences, romantic and non-romantic, that lead us (or US citizens, at least) to feel loved. Some of the results are obvious – many participants agreed that making love, being hugged, receiving compliments and gifts, make us feel loved. But there was even stronger agreement that mundane yet touching gestures make us feel loved, such as our pets being happy to see us, a child snuggling up to us, or someone showing us compassion.</p>
<p><span id="more-35619"></span></p>
<p>Employing an approach known as “cultural consensus theory”, Saeideh Heshmati at Penn State University and her colleagues presented nearly 500 online participants (men and women aged 18 to 93 selected to be representative of the US population as a whole) with 60 everyday scenarios, and for each one asked them to indicate whether it was true or false that most people would feel loved in that situation (or to pass if they didn’t know).</p>
<p>Other scenarios for which there was particularly strong agreement that the situation would provoke felt love included being cared for when sick; being told “I love you”; spending time with one’s children; being made to feel special; and spending quality time with someone.</p>
<p>There was far less agreement around whether situations that do not involve other people prompt feelings of being loved or not, such as the sun shining or eating one’s favourite food.</p>
<p>In terms of the everyday situations that do <em>not</em> provoke feelings of being loved, there was striking agreement that this is the case for any behaviours by others that imply they are being overly controlling or possessive, such as wanting to know where you are at all times, or wanting to spend all their time with you. The researchers speculated this might be a reflection of the individualistic culture in America with its celebration of personal liberty, and that findings in other cultures may differ.</p>
<p>Another angle on their results the researchers looked at was whether there are particular groups who are more at odds with the consensus on felt love than others. They found that men seemed less attuned to the consensus than women. Perhaps, they suggested, this is a reflection of men’s greater focus on passionate, sexual love (as revealed by earlier research) and the fact women may have found it easier to reflect on the everyday, nonsexual love explored in the current study. Also, people currently in a romantic relationship showed more awareness of the consensus on felt love (perhaps because they experience the emotion more often, the researchers surmised), as did white people (perhaps because, being the ethnic majority, their beliefs formed more of the consensus).</p>
<p>In terms of personality, participants higher in trait agreeableness were more in tune with the collective views on felt love, which seems intuitive, but so too were participants higher in neuroticism (i.e. with low emotional stability, who are known to go through more relationship difficulties on average), which is harder to explain. This last finding may reflect that “individuals high in neuroticism still experience love, they simply do not have lasting love experiences…,” the researchers said.</p>
<p>The main take-away from the research, Heshmati and her team added, is that “people feel loved in a range of settings much wider than just romantic relationships ..”, and “although knowledge of love can differ between people, there is a consensus within the US culture about which scenarios elicit love in most people.”</p>
<p>An important caveat to remember when interpreting these results is that participants  were sharing their beliefs about the times they believed “most people” feel loved – they weren’t actually reporting their <em>own</em> experiences (though they may have extrapolated from their own experiences to make inferences about people in general). It would be intriguing to see how the results might differ if participants were simply asked to report their own experiences. For now this fascinating research lays the groundwork for future investigations to explore felt love in other cultures and to see how it interacts with other psychological traits not measured here, such as attachment style.</p>

<img alt="" class="attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image" height="110" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2018/12/8935858-140x110.jpg" style="display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;" width="140" /><p>The Polio Eradication Programme in Nigeria is making positive strides towards interruption of wild poliovirus (WPV). The past two decades were marked with surges in WPV cases that saw Nigeria accounting for almost half of the global burden of WPV in 2005. During 2003-2013, the Global Polio Eradication Initiative (GPEI) faced a serious challenge with resurgence of polio virus originating from Nigeria in twenty-six previously polio-free countries in sub Saharan Africa and beyond.</p>
<p>WPV cases increased from 202 in 2002 to a peak of 1,122 in 2006 following suspension of immunization campaigns in northern Nigeria due to unfounded rumors of oral polio vaccine (OPV) safety. Through an aggressive effort, the suspension was lifted and the campaigns reinstated.</p>
<p>Another surge in WPV cases was recorded in 2012 with 122 cases, up from 63 cases in 2011. In 2012, the Nigerian government launched the national polio eradication emergency plan (NPEEP) to intensify efforts to interrupt WPV transmission. A progressive decline in WPV1 cases was thereafter achieved from 122 in 2012 to 0 in 2015.</p>
<p>The strong leadership of the program by the Government of Nigeria at Federal and State level, the engagement of the traditional institutions, establishment of an Incident Management System through Emergency Operation Centres (EOC) to coordinate all efforts of government and partners at Federal level and in high risk states, and the localized innovative strategies to address the outbreak were some of the major contributing factors to the progress registered.</p>
<p>The program came close to marking two years without WPV1 in 2016. After twenty-three months without detection of WPV1, four cases were detected from areas that had not been accessible to the program for over three years due to insecurity in Borno state, north eastern Nigeria. Genetic sequencing of the viruses revealed the closest known link to a virus last detected in Borno in 2011, indicating prolonged undetected circulation for over four years.</p>
<blockquote><p>At the time of publishing this supplement in 2018, the country has marked just over two years without WPV1.</p></blockquote>
<p>While the resurgence of WPV1 in 2016 paused a major setback to the country and regional progress, it provided an opportunity for the program to stretch its innovative capacity to mount a response in a complex environment. The outbreak in Borno demonstrated the necessity of ensuring accessibility, particularly for surveillance to rule out any undetected presence of the virus.</p>
<p>Innovative strategies for surveillance and vaccination, and strengthening of partnerships with non-traditional actors have been instrumental to the progress registered so far in the response to the 2016 outbreak. At the time of publishing this supplement in 2018, the country has marked just over two years without WPV1. However, an estimated 70,000 under-five children remain trapped in insecure areas of Borno state, and therefore the progress is acknowledged with caution. Nigeria still remains among the three WPV endemic countries globally, along with Afghanistan and Pakistan.</p>
<p>This supplement presents some of the innovations, lessons learned and best practices that the Nigerian government and its polio partners implemented during 2014-2016 towards interruption of WPV transmission. The programmatic interventions described here include innovative strategies such as directly observed vaccination (DOPV), addressing unmet needs of non-compliant households, use of mobile hard-to-reach teams, focus on nomadic groups and engagement of security personnel to interrupt polio virus transmission in polio sanctuaries in northern Nigeria, along rivers of interest and security compromised areas respectively.</p>
<p>Ensuring sensitive and quality surveillance to detect any suspect viruses is a key aspect of the NPEEP. Initiatives to intensify surveillance at field level, evaluate the quality of documentation and profile of polio compatible cases have been implemented in Nigeria. Furthermore, innovations such as Auto-Visual AFP Detection and Reporting (AVADAR), and use of mobile technology for monitoring program performance have facilitated reporting in real-time for decision making and timely action.</p>
<p>In line with the strategic focus of the Global Polio End Game Strategy and Plan, the switch from tOPV to bOPV was successfully implemented in April 2016 and some lessons from the field have been documented. In addition, laboratory containment activities, in conformity with the Global Action Plan III, were implemented.</p>
<p>We believe that these public health interventions, among other activities, have contributed to the progress registered for far in the polio eradication program in Nigeria and will further enable Nigeria achieve and sustain polio-free status. The ongoing effort to utilize the lessons learned and assets available to improve routine immunization, integrated disease surveillance and response, and primary health care will be maximized to ensure a smooth transition towards certification of polio eradication. It is our hope that these interventions and experiences will be of interest to public health and other stakeholders.</p>

Yes, if it’s in the morning, they have longer to work out what to do about it, but you might be better off plumping for the evening because according to a <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/epdf/10.1002/npr2.12042">new study</a>, published open-access in <i>Neuropsychopharmacology,</i> they’re likely to suffer less of a physiological stress response at this time.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

<p>If a threat – whether physical or psychological – doesn’t quickly vanish, communication between a trio of brain regions – the hypothalamus, the pituitary glands and the adrenal cortex (known collectively as the HPA axis) – causes, among other things, an increase in levels of the hormone cortisol, which triggers the release of glucose, for energy, into the bloodstream. This stress response effectively provides our muscles with extra fuel to fight or flee.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>However, there’s also a daily pattern to our baseline levels of cortisol production – healthy people typically experience a spike around waking, and a steady decrease in levels throughout the day.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>All kinds of other factors also influence an individual’s cortisol levels at any given time, including age, sex, sleep/wake time preferences, exercise patterns and general stress levels. This raises the possibility that how we respond physically to stress might vary depending on the time of day.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>To find out, Yujiro Yamanaka at Hokkaido University and colleagues recruited 20 male and 7 female healthy young subjects with similar typical sleep durations and average wake/sleep times (in other words, they were not “larks” or “owls”); also none of them had a history of hormonal, psychiatric or sleep problems. The participants first gave saliva samples every two hours for one day, so their typical daily cortisol levels could be assessed.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>They were then randomised to undergo a stressful experience either two hours after they typically woke up, or ten hours afterwards. For the stress experience, the researchers used the widely-used Trier Social Stress test, which requires people to give a presentation and perform mental arithmetic in front of interviewers, while being videoed. Saliva samples were collected from all the participants before their test, immediately afterwards and then every ten minutes for half an hour.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>The researchers found that the group that were stressed in the morning showed a statistically significant increase in their cortisol levels after the test, compared with before (a sign of a large stress response). In contrast, the cortisol increase in the evening group was smaller and did not reach statistical significance.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>The researchers said it seems that the HPA axis “has a powerful response to acute psychological stress in the morning rather than in the evening”. Animal research suggests that this might be because the adrenal cortex typically becomes less sensitive to ACTH, the hormone produced by the pituitary gland that triggers the release of cortisol, as the day wears on.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>What are the implications of all this?<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Given all the factors that affect an individual’s cortisol levels and their response to stress, the real-world impact of experiencing morning vs. evening stress is far from clear. There’s another complication – the researchers explained that if stress in the evening doesn’t significantly hike cortisol levels, and so does not increase glucose availability, we might in fact be <i>more</i> vulnerable to any threat, because we might find it harder to mount a useful response. On the other hand, if that stressor is something we can’t immediately combat, and we’re frequently stressed, arguably it might be better to have a lower cortisol response, because chronically elevated levels of cortisol are associated with ill health. In other words, the short answer to the question of whether to share bad news in the morning or evening is: “it depends!”.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, for other researchers interested in stress, these new results (while they need replicating with larger samples) also have implications: the time of day of experiments investigating stress could, it seems, affect the results in important ways.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

                <h4><a href="http://romainbrette.fr/epistemologie-politique-i-introduction/">Epistémologie politique (I) Introduction</a></h4>

<p>Dans cette série, je m’intéresse à l’épistémologie de la pensée politique. J’entends ici par épistémologie la théorie de la connaissance de manière générale, c’est-à-dire pas seulement la connaissance scientifique mais la connaissance du monde, plus généralement. Dans la pensée politique, il y a bien sûr un aspect normatif (comment la société devrait être organisée et dans quel but) mais cette normativité prend toujours appui sur une théorie du monde : comment fonctionnent la société, l’économie, les structures de pouvoir. Elle inclut également toujours un certain nombre de présupposés sur la psychologie humaine. Par exemple, selon une théorie typiquement associée à la droite conservatrice, l’homme est un loup pour l’homme (Hobbes) ; il s’ensuit que des institutions doivent être créées pour protéger l’homme de ses congénères. Une variante (droite libérale) est que l’homme cherche avant tout à maximiser à son intérêt personnel ; il s’ensuit que les institutions sociales doivent être organisées de façon à ce que l’intérêt personnel coïncide avec l’intérêt collectif. Selon une autre théorie ancrée à gauche, l’homme est naturellement altruiste (Rousseau) ; il s’ensuit que la société doit être organisée pour faciliter la coopération entre les hommes (avec bien sûr de nombreuses variantes ; anarchismes, communismes, etc).</p>
<p>Ainsi les doctrines politiques sont en grande partie déterminées par des théories sous-jacentes de l’homme et du monde. Par conséquent, les désaccords politiques sont très souvent liés à des désaccords sur ces théories et se manifestent donc sur le plan épistémologique. Par exemple, les discours de droite tendent à se présenter comme « réalistes » ; la droite libérale comme « rationnelle » ; par opposition à une gauche qui serait « utopiste ». En utilisant ces mots, on se place non sur le plan de la finalité politique mais sur celui de la connaissance : on admet que la finalité des systèmes politiques critiqués est louable, mais on prétend qu’ils reposent sur une vision fausse de la façon dont le monde fonctionne. C’est donc réellement sur la connaissance que porte le jugement, sur la validité empirique des théories sous-jacentes.</p>
<p>Le système politique néolibéral, par exemple (habituellement classé au centre droit), refuse généralement l’appellation « néolibéral », pourquoi ? Parce que ses partisans ne pensent pas suivre une doctrine particulière, mais simplement exprimer ce qui est rationnel, « logique ». D’un point de vue épistémologique, cette posture est critiquable, puisque la logique s’exprime dans un cadre formel, et donc dans un modèle particulier. Autrement dit, la rationalité s’exerce au sein d’une théorie particulière du monde, ce qui fait que deux discours contradictoires peuvent être rationnels, mais relatifs à des théories différentes. Par exemple, les discours Keynésiens et néoclassiques sont deux discours rationnels contradictoires, parce qu’ils reposent sur des modèles différents. Conformément à cette posture rationaliste, la pensée néolibérale ou néoclassique repose largement sur une connaissance mathématisée, c’est-à-dire dont les questions portent sur des aspects formels plutôt que sur la validité empirique du modèle sous-jacent (comme le concept de l’agent rationnel). La théorie tend par conséquent à ignorer les champs du savoir permettant de questionner empiriquement les modèles socio-économiques, tels que l’histoire, la sociologie, l’anthropologie. On peut donc formuler une critique épistémologique de cette pensée politique.</p>
<p>De manière symétrique, le discours de gauche tend à dépeindre la pensée politique de droite comme la manifestation sournoise de mauvaises intentions. Par exemple, le discours économique de droite tend à promouvoir la réduction de l’impôt, en particulier sur les plus riches. Ceci est vu par la critique de gauche comme la défense des intérêts d’une classe dominante. Pourquoi ? Encore une fois, on peut analyser la question sous l’angle épistémologique. Selon les théories de gauche, l’impôt est ce qui permet de répartir équitablement les richesses. Par conséquent, une mesure tendant à réduire l’impôt favorise les classes riches de la population. Il s’ensuit qu’un système politique qui promeut cette mesure doit avoir pour but de favoriser ces classes. Il s’agit encore une fois de la simple expression de la rationalité au sein d’un cadre théorique. On a donc dans le discours néolibéral et dans sa critique deux discours rationnels au sein de cadres théoriques différents.</p>
<p>Ce dernier exemple soulève un autre point épistémologique intéressant, qui est la façon dont les partisans d’une théorie jugent ceux d’une autre théorie. On voit dans cet exemple l’opposition de deux mépris : le néolibéral considère son critique comme idiot (irrationnel) ; le critique considère le néolibéral comme égoïste et de mauvaise foi. Dans les deux cas, le partisan juge son adversaire en utilisant son propre cadre théorique, c’est-à-dire comme si l’adversaire utilisait le même cadre théorique. En effet, le néolibéral juge son critique idiot, parce que ce critique serait effectivement idiot s’il adoptait le cadre théorique néolibéral mais n’en tirait pas les conclusions logiques (d’où le discours récurrent des gouvernants face à leur opposition qu’il faut « faire de la pédagogie », ce qui est perçu à juste titre comme du mépris). De même, l’opposant juge le néolibéral de mauvaise foi, c’est-à-dire qu’il considère que celui-ci est tout à fait conscient que ses propositions politiques favorisent la classe dominante. Or ceci suppose qu’il a adopté le cadre théorique alternatif de l’opposant. Dans les deux cas donc, chacun semble négliger la possibilité que son propre cadre de pensée est une théorie dont il est convaincu, et non une vérité évidente et universelle. Il en résulte une critique relativement stérile, en cela qu’elle ne porte pas sur les fondements (notamment empiriques) des théories en compétition mais sur les supposées compétences des interlocuteurs d’un côté (arguments d’autorité) et sur les intérêts personnels ou de classe de l’autre (invectives).</p>
<p>On touche ici à deux points distincts. D’une part, au statut épistémologique des théories (est-ce qu’elles se valent toutes et ne sont que des points de vue ? ou peut-on les juger empiriquement ou théoriquement ?). Sur ce point, on peut s’appuyer sur une riche littérature en philosophie des sciences. D’autre part, à la psychologie des croyances : qu’est-ce qui fait que l’on croit à certaines théories plutôt qu’à d’autres, et qu’éventuellement on change d’avis ? Sur ce deuxième point, on peut s’appuyer également sur une riche littérature en psychologie sociale, comme la <a href="https://www.psychologie-sociale.com/index.php/fr/theories/influence/6-la-theorie-de-la-dissonance-cognitive">théorie de la dissonance cognitive</a> dont je parlerai dans un prochain texte. Celle-ci propose que l’on cherche à rendre nos actes et nos croyances cohérents non seulement en agissant conformément à nos croyances, mais également dans de nombreux cas en adaptant nos croyances à nos actes (entre autres). Par exemple, une personne qui gagne beaucoup d’argent peut se convaincre qu’un système politique qui favorise l’inégalité est plus efficace. Ceci explique l’alignement entre catégories sociologiques et croyances politiques, qui est plus satisfaisante que la théorie de la mauvaise foi. Ce n’est effectivement pas un hasard si les classes supérieures tendent à adopter une théorie qui justifie leur position sociale (e.g. la théorie néolibérale), mais cela ne veut pas dire pour autant que cette adoption est cynique. Au contraire, ces croyances sont sincères. Simplement, différentes catégories sociologiques et culturelles sont plus ou moins susceptibles d’adopter différentes croyances.</p>
<p>Dans cette série, je compte donc développer une critique épistémologique du discours politique.</p>

<p>In this paper we introduce three methods for re-scaling data sets aiming at improving the likelihood of clustering validity indexes to return the true number of spherical Gaussian clusters with additional noise features. Our method obtains feature re-scaling factors taking into account the structure of a given data set and the intuitive idea that different features may have different degrees of relevance at different clusters. We experiment with the Silhouette (using squared Euclidean, Manhattan, and the pth power of the Minkowski distance), Dunn’s, Calinski–Harabasz and Hartigan indexes on data sets with spherical Gaussian clusters with and without noise features. We conclude that our methods indeed increase the chances of estimating the true number of clusters in a data set.</p>

<p>The issue of determining “the right number of clusters” in K-Means has attracted considerable interest, especially in the recent years. Cluster intermix appears to be a factor most affecting the clustering results. This paper proposes an experimental setting for comparison of different approaches at data generated from Gaussian clusters with the controlled parameters of between- and within-cluster spread to model cluster intermix. The setting allows for evaluating the centroid recovery on par with conventional evaluation of the cluster recovery. The subjects of our interest are two versions of the “intelligent” K-Means method, ik-Means, that find the “right” number of clusters by extracting “anomalous patterns” from the data one-by-one. We compare them with seven other methods, including Hartigan’s rule, averaged Silhouette width and Gap statistic, under different between- and within-cluster spread-shape conditions. There are several consistent patterns in the results of our experiments, such as that the right K is reproduced best by Hartigan’s rule – but not clusters or their centroids. This leads us to propose an adjusted version of iK-Means, which performs well in the current experiment setting.</p>

<p>“Learning styles” – there can be few ideas that have created such a stark disconnect between the experts on the ground and the evidence published in scholarly journals. Endorsed by the overwhelming majority of teachers, yet dismissed by most psychologists and educational neuroscientists as a “neuromyth”, the basis of learning styles is that people learn better when taught via their preferred learning modality, usually (but not always) described as either visual, auditory or kinaesthetic.</p>
<p>Many studies have already uncovered <a href="https://www.wired.com/2015/01/need-know-learning-styles-myth-two-minutes/">serious problems with the learning styles concept</a>, such as that measures of learning styles are invalid and that students do not in fact learn better via their preferred modality. Now further evidence against learning styles comes from Greece, in one of the first investigations on the topic to involve primary school pupils.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/feduc.2018.00105/full">Writing in <em>Frontiers in Education</em></a>, Marietta Papadatou-Pastou and her colleagues report that teachers and pupils did not agree on the pupils’ preferred learning modality – a significant blow for the learning styles concept since “teachers typically adopt learning styles within a classroom context by relying on their own assessment of students’ learning styles.”</p>
<p><span id="more-35587"></span></p>
<p>The study was simple enough – nearly 200 fifth- and sixth-grade pupils (average age 11 years) from five schools chose which was their preferred learning style out of visual, auditory or kinaesthetic. They also completed a short IQ test (the Raven’s matrices). Next, their teachers – 19 took part – first provided an open-ended answer to the question “Does teaching that is tailor-made to the students’ learning style reinforce the students’ performance?”, then they were asked to identify each of their pupils’ favoured style (such that each child was rated by one teacher).</p>
<p>All of the participating teachers endorsed the concept of learning styles. However, there was not a statistically significant correlation between the teachers’ judgments of their pupils’ favoured learning style and the pupils’ own declaration of their preference. “We posit that identifying preferred learning style can be a hit-and-miss process, with no agreement between the assessment made by teachers and students,” the researchers said.</p>
<p>There was also no association between the teachers’ judgments of pupils’ learning style and the pupils’ IQ, suggesting the teachers were not using IQ as a proxy for learning style.</p>
<p>A weakness of the study was that the teachers were not asked specifically about the kind of learning styles approach they used or favoured, so it’s possible they were not familiar with the visual, auditory, kinaesthetic breakdown, though this seems unlikely since this so-called VARK model is the most popular.</p>
<p>Papadatou-Pastou and her team concluded that “… if the identification of learning styles … is unreliable, as evidence by the findings of the present study, this should constitute an additional reason why teachers should abandon the use of learning styles in instruction.”</p>

Also contentious is its demand that all research papers funded by cOAlition S members must be published under the most liberal Creative Commons licence (<span class="MsoHyperlink"><a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/">CC BY</a></span> or equivalent). </span></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><span>While cOAlition S <span class="MsoHyperlink"><a href="https://www.coalition-s.org/feedback/">subsequently announced</a></span> that hybrid OA will get a <span class="MsoHyperlink"><a href="https://www.timeshighereducation.com/news/plan-s-three-year-transition-period-hybrid-journals">three-year stay of execution</a></span>, <i>Nature </i><span class="MsoHyperlink"><a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-06178-7">calculates</a></span> that banning hybrid OA means that European researchers will be unable to publish in 85% of the journals they currently submit too. Rather they will need to publish in “pure” gold OA journals, which in most cases will require paying article-processing charges (APCs).

<p><i>By</i> <a href="https://emmayoung.net/">Emma Young</a></p>
<p>We make all kinds of snap decisions about a person based on their facial appearance. How trustworthy we think they are is one of the most important, as it can have many social and financial consequences, from influencing our decisions about whether to lend someone money to <a href="http://www.acrwebsite.org/volumes/1019689/volumes/v43/NA-43">which Airbnb property to book</a>.</p>
<p>However, as the authors of a <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/bjop.12357">new study</a>, published in the <i>British Journal of Psychology</i>, note, “Although facial impressions of trustworthiness are formed automatically, they are not especially accurate predictors of trustworthy behaviour.” People who are less susceptible to forming these impressions could, then, be at an advantage. And, as Jasmine Hooper at the University of Western of Australia and colleagues now report, men with high levels of autistic traits fall into this category.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><span id="more-35584"></span></p>
<p><a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/1362361314559431">Earlier work</a> (involving two authors of the new study) already hinted that autism might have a bearing on whether people act on first impressions in a typical way. The researchers found that when they prompted boys diagnosed with autism to judge trustworthiness from photographs, they formed the same kinds of impressions as non-autistic boys, but unlike them, they did not use these judgments in their decision-making in an economic trust game.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>To explore whether higher levels of autistic-like traits, such as increased attention to detail, might also affect the use of first impressions even among the general population, the researchers recruited 46 men without autism, who completed the Autism-Spectrum Quotient (a symptom-based scale which is typically used by clinicians to diagnose autism) and a facial trustworthiness impressions task. The researchers found that, as they predicted, when prompted to make trustworthiness judgements from faces, people with high or low levels of autistic traits made similar judgements. But the next phase of the study showed some important differences between the two groups.</p>
<p>All the participants also took part in an adult version of the economic trust game used in the earlier research with boys, in which they interacted with virtual “partners”, who had been independently rated as looking either trustworthy or untrustworthy. Over a series of trials, these partners were consistently fair or selfish, and crucially this behaviour pattern was <i>not</i> related to their facial appearance. Therefore the best strategy for predicting future behaviour – and making money, because participants could keep their winnings – was for the participants to ignore appearances and focus solely on their partner’s behaviour in previous money allocation trials.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Again as the researchers predicted, the men with relatively low levels of autistic traits were influenced by how trustworthy or not the partners looked. The men who scored relatively high on the AQ scale were influenced too, but to a significantly lesser extent – they were more influenced by their partners’ actual behaviour.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Only between 1 and 1.5 per cent of people in the UK are thought to meet the criteria for a diagnosis of autism spectrum disorder. However, many other people do not meet the diagnostic criteria for autism but do have relatively high levels of autistic traits – there may therefore be a sizeable subset of people who are able to form trustworthiness judgements based on people’s faces when prompted, but who don’t do this automatically, and also aren’t so inclined to use these judgments in their social decisions (and so are less swayed by potentially misleading facial impressions than the rest of the population).<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>As the researchers note, “If facial impressions are not especially accurate predictions of actual trustworthiness, failure to use them to guide trust decisions may actually represent highly rational social behaviour.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

<p>A drop in the number of medical students entering the field of obstetrics and gynecology in the United States led to teaching institutions making a number of changes. It was hoped that the changes would encourage students to enter the field and now, nearly 15 years later that strategy appears to have worked.</p>
<p>In a recent publication by <a href="https://bmcmededuc.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12909-018-1362-4" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Isabel C. Green and colleagues</a>, the authors looked into which factors were the most important in determining students’ choice of an OB GYN career. Through interviews with students who had chosen to specialize in obstetrics and gynecology, Green et al. discovered which aspects of teaching and which pre-medical school experiences were most likely to lead to an interest in the field.</p>

The trial will be using an internet-based support program to help survivors meet recommended guidelines for activity.</p>
<p>Improving physical activity levels for those who have completed cancer treatment has been shown to help the overall wellbeing of survivors and raise their quality of life. If the PABLO trial can show that this approach can help cancer survivors in real terms and is cost-effective, it may become a part of standard care.</p>

<p>As winter approaches, the public is often encouraged to seek influenza vaccination, especially for young children and the elderly. However, another high risk population which can be overlooked is health professionals. Health professionals are exposed to unique risk factors and so ensuring that they are vaccinated is especially important.</p>

<img alt="" class="attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image" height="110" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2018/12/iStock_67365777_XXXLARGE-140x110.jpg" style="display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;" width="140" /><h3><strong>Physicians’ involvement in human rights</strong></h3>
<p>As physicians we’re often confronted with different issues of ethics and human rights at different levels. Physicians can on the one hand be involved in the treatment of injuries related to war, but also in different forms of human rights violations.</p>
<p>Salvador Allende and Che Guevara were physicians seen as heroes and social reformers by many, even outside of their respective countries: <a href="http://content.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,991268,00.html">Time magazine</a> claimed Guevara to be one of most influential personalities of the 20th century. On the other hand there have been physicians like Mengele or Illig working actively and by their own free decision without regard for medical ethics in the German and Austrian National Socialist regime performing dubious “research” in the <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26749461">spirit of that ideology</a>.</p>
<p>Physicians can also be convinced to <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15776476">violate ethical standards</a> in a situation of “<a href="https://www.bmj.com/content/350/bmj.h589.long">dual obligations</a>”, common in situations such as prisons. Dr. Wendy Orr, a former District Surgeon in Port Elizabeth in South Africa, wrote in her foreword to the British Medical Association’s handbook on medicine and human rights, about her work with detainees during the <a href="https://europepmc.org/backend/ptpmcrender.fcgi?accid=PMC1733645&amp;blobtype=pdf">apartheid regime</a>. She describes how she became aware of the systematic abuse of detainees by the security forces and the silence and complicity of her medical colleagues. She recounts her growing moral disorientation as she realized she was expected to declare patients “fit” for corporal punishment.</p>
<p>Similar situations have recently been reported in asylum cases even in countries with better earlier human rights track records. US physicians and psychologists have further been involved in planning and observation of <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosmedicine/article?id=10.1371/journal.pmed.1001027">torturing prisoners in Guantanamo</a>.</p>
<h3><strong>Upholding human rights</strong></h3>
<p>Human rights systems such as the universal prohibition of torture, outlined in <a href="https://www.ohchr.org/en/professionalinterest/pages/cat.aspx">UN Convention against Torture</a> are so fundamental that they cannot be suspended under any circumstances, they are “non-derogable”, and their violation can and must be investigated and prosecuted. Physicians should have a special positive role in this process.</p>
<p>The “<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10509518">Istanbul Protocol</a>” supported equally by the UN, and the World Medical Association, is an interdisciplinary standard that guides physicians and legal professionals to collaborate in ethical and humanitarian standards, forensic documentation, reporting, and investigation of <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosmedicine/article?id=10.1371/journal.pmed.1001027">alleged torture</a>. It can also contribute to new strategies in the <a href="https://europepmc.org/abstract/med/28748402">protection of survivors</a> applying for asylum and for <a href="https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007%2F978-3-319-72914-5.pdf">prosecution of perpetrators</a>.</p>
<p>Physicians can put themselves at risk for upholding these legal and ethical standards. For instance, it’s been <a href="http://persian2english.com/?p=16713">reported</a> that those who have witnessed torture in Kahrizak prison in Iran have been killed.</p>

<p>An Iranian physician, Ahmadreza Jalali, has been <a href="https://www.nature.com/news/iranian-scholar-sentenced-to-death-1.22875">sentenced to death</a> in Iran because of allegations of spying for other countries. Up to now none of international protests and activities for his unconditional release have proven to lead to any significant positive development.</p>
<p>All over the world health professionals put themselves in danger by being involved in activities to maintain human rights through organizations such as Physician for Human Rights, Physicians without Borders, the International Rehabilitation Council for Torture Survivors. Without involvement of these organizations many areas of the world crisis regions would have <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5950640/">no access to medical care</a>.</p>
<p>The basic background of these activities are international standards and treaties along with ethical guidelines of the medical profession. The 1948 Universal Declaration of Human Rights already mentions <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22166259">health as part of the right to an adequate standard of living</a> (art. 25). The right to health was again recognized as a human right in the 1966 <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28559680">International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights</a>. There are international instances of shortage of access to medical services, because of military conflicts or secondary to sanctions against a country.</p>
<h3><strong>New challenges to ethics</strong></h3>
<p>Recently, the practice of medicine has been subject to several transformations with unprecedented ethical challenges. One is the exponential increase in the sophistication and reach of medical technology. From genetic manipulation to in-vitro fertilization, <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4727252/">data</a> and <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17106632">confidentiality protection</a> to the ethical risks enclosed at times in the <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25951678">enormous advances</a> in life-saving research and treatment, medicine has given rise to moral challenges of huge social significance that medicine itself, and the Hippocratic tradition, have on their own not sufficiently responded to. Instead medicine has formed a fertile relationship with other disciplines, such as moral philosophy and medical law, to seek philosophically coherent and socially and legally <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23093515">acceptable responses to these questions</a>.</p>
<p>Given that the most serious threats to medical impartiality have come largely from interference by governmental agencies, but also by excessively powerful commercial companies or political groups, a critical aspect of medical impartiality is the doctors’ ability to <a href="https://bmcmedethics.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1472-6939-15-24">speak out about health-related aspects of conflicts</a>.</p>
<p>Where, for example, doctors are seeing patients who have sustained injuries as a result of state responses to civil unrest, the documentation and reporting of those injuries is a core part of the medical response. If doctors cannot speak out, if they cannot draw attention to the health-related impacts of conflicts, they risk the loss of their professional independence.</p>
<p>If they voluntarily violate fundamental standards, they should not be permitted to practice and medical associations and governments should take care to take all necessary steps to ensure this principle, while on the other hand <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/3517401">supporting human rights defenders</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Friedrich_Schiller">Friedrich Schiller</a>, also a physician, was against any restriction of personal or political freedom and emphasizes in the following poem in a way that could be extrapolated to the duties of physicians that we should focus our work on the needs of our patients:</p>
<p>Live with your century;</p>
<p>but do not be its creature.</p>
<p>Work for your contemporaries;</p>
<p>but create what they need,</p>
<p>not what they praise</p>

<p><em>By guest blogger</em> <a href="http://www.jessesingal.com/">Jesse Singal</a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For a long time, some psychologists have understood that their field has an issue with WEIRDness. That is, psychology experiments disproportionately involve participants who are Western, Educated, and hail from Industrialised, Rich Democracies, which means many findings may not generalise to other populations, such as, say, rural Samoan villagers. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a <a href="https://www.pnas.org/content/115/45/11401">new paper</a> in </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">PNAS</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a team of researchers led by Mostafa Salari Rad decided to zoom in on a leading psychology journal to better understand the field’s WEIRD problem, evaluate whether things are improving, and come up with some possible changes in practice that could help spur things along.</span><span id="more-35572"></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For their paper, nicely titled, </span><a href="http://www.pnas.org/content/115/45/11401"><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Toward a psychology of Homo sapiens: Making psychological science more representative of the human population,”</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Rad and his colleagues pulled two samples of articles published in </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Psychological Science</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">: all articles published in 2014, and the last three issues from 2017. Unfortunately for the field of psychology, they found little evidence to suggest that </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Psychological Science</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, published by the US-based Association for Psychological Science, has addressed the WEIRD problem. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Looking at the participant groups in the subset of the 2014 articles in which authors included demographic information, “57.76% were drawn from the US, 71.25% were drawn from English-speaking countries (including the US and UK), and 94.15% … sampled Western countries (including English-speaking countries, Europe, and Israel).” The 2017 numbers weren’t much better.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So there’s clearly a problem. But, Rad’s team added, “[p]erhaps the most disturbing aspect of our analysis was the lack of information given about WEIRDness of samples, and the lack of consideration given to issues of cultural diversity in bounding the conclusions”. That is, the articles they examined all too often omitted information that could help other researchers note WEIRDness when it occurs, and all too often explicitly over-extrapolated findings drawn from WEIRD samples. Summing up these problems in the 2014 sample, Rad and his colleagues said: “</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Over 72% of abstracts contained no information about the population sampled, 83% of studies did not report analysis of any effects of the diversity of their sample (e.g., gender effects), over 85% of studies neglected to discuss the possible effects of culture and context on their findings, and 84% failed to simply recommend studying the phenomena concerned in other cultures, implying that the results indicated something generalizable to humans outside specific cultural contexts.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The authors don’t just grumble about the problem – they offer some concrete potential fixes based on their findings:</span></p>
<p><b>“Required Reporting of Sample Characteristics”</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> — It’s already the norm to report the gender breakdowns of experimental samples; Rad and his colleagues think that authors should be “required to report [other characteristics including] age, SES, ethnicity, religion, and nationality,” when it is practical and realistic to do so.</span></p>
<p><b>“Explicitly Tie Findings to Populations” </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">— Less “We discovered X about people”, and more “We discovered X about a small group of undergraduates with the following demographic characteristics in New Haven, Connecticut.” </span></p>
<p><b>“Justify the Sampled Population” </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">— Authors should have to explain why they chose the population they chose – and sometimes, as Rad et al note, yes, the answer will be </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">convenience</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">. That’s fine, within reason: The problem isn’t that college students are studied </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">sometimes</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, it’s that they’re studied </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">far too often</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><b>“Discuss generalisability of the Finding” </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">– Similar to the point about populations above, the idea is simply that authors should explicitly discuss whether they expect a given finding will generalise beyond the experimented-upon population, and why.</span></p>
<p><b>“Analytical Investigation of Existing Diversity” </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">– Even WEIRD samples often have </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">some</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> degree of diversity to them along certain dimensions, so here Rad and his colleagues are suggesting that authors check for the presence of diversity-related moderators, both gender (which is already reported, usually) and other characteristics like race (which often aren’t). In other words, even if your experimental sample is mostly WEIRD, it could be informative to check whether, for example, the small handful of black participants produced different data than the rest of the group.</span></p>
<p><b>Recommendations for editors and reviewers</b></p>
<p><b>“Non-WEIRD = Novel and Important”</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> – “Journal editors should instruct reviewers to treat non-WEIRDness as a marker of the interest and importance of a paper.”</span></p>
<p><b>“Diversity Badges” </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">– Some journals already award “badges” when authors pre-register or engage in other open-science best-practices. Badges for research centered on under-studied populations could be a nice little incentive-nudge.</span></p>
<p><b>“Diversity Targets” </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">– It would be reasonable, argue the authors, to have at least 50 per cent of published papers analyse non-WEIRD populations. Ideally, it would be higher, but as the numbers above show the situation at the moment is pretty dire, 50 per cent would be a major improvement.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">***</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The above suggestions provide a solid jumping-off-point for solving the WEIRD problem: Any one of them could be debated, discussed, and potentially modified or implemented. The next step, then, will be to see whether journals – the most important deciders when it comes scientific standard – will take up the mantle. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At the risk of getting overly meta-psychological – discussing the psychological science of how psychological science is conducted – a great deal of human behaviour can be boiled down to the path of least resistance and to incentives. Often it’s not a deep-seated bias or a lack of concern about other groups that causes researchers to overlook non-WEIRD samples (though I’m sure both are </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">sometimes</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> factors), but rather it’s because college students are </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">right there</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">. As in, literally in the same buildings as the ones where most psych researchers work. You can just put up some flyers, and </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">boom</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, you have a group you can experiment on! It’s all too tempting. And it’ll take some incentive-shifting – shifts to editors’ behaviour, or the possibility of earning badges, or whatever else – to get researchers out of their WEIRD rut.</span></p>

An intriguing new study uses the 2016 US Presidential election as a tool to examine the organization of human memory.

The results show that events that occur around the same time are linked in memory. Remembering one past event tends to trigger the recall of other memories from that time. This chronological clustering makes intuitive sense, but it's a theory that's been debated in psychology for a while, under the name of the temporal-contiguity effect (TCE).

<p>It is better to ask a student to see if they can explain something to themselves, than for a teacher or book to always explain it to them. That’s according to a new meta-analysis of the findings from 64 prior studies involving nearly 6000 participants that compared learning outcomes from prompted self-explanation compared to instructor explanation, or compared to time spent using other study techniques such as taking notes, summarising, thinking out loud (without the reflection and elaboration involved in self-explanation), or solving more problems.</p>
<p>The authors of the meta-analysis, <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs10648-018-9434-x">published recently in </a><a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs10648-018-9434-x"><em>Educational Psychology Review</em></a>, say that self-explanation is a powerful learning strategy because learners “generate inferences about causal connections and conceptual relationships that enhance understanding”. The process of self-explanation also helps the learner realise what they don’t know, “to fill in missing information, monitor understanding, and modify fusions of new information with prior knowledge when discrepancies or deficiencies are detected”.</p>
<p><span id="more-35529"></span></p>
<p>Past research already established that more effective learners are more inclined to self-explain spontaneously. The meta-analysis confirms that, importantly, prompted self-explanation is also beneficial. Overall, Kiran Bisra and her team at Simon Fraser University found that when students are prompted to self-explain (usually this is in written form, though a few studies involved spoken self-explanation) this improves their learning outcomes with an average effect size of 0.55 (using Hedge’s g), which in a learning context is impressive – “a potentially powerful” intervention in the authors’ words, similar in effectiveness to “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mastery_learning">mastery learning</a>” and “peer tutoring”.</p>
<p>Self-explanation was more effective than instructor explanation (explanation given by a teacher or teaching materials), but instructor explanation was better than no explanation, which suggests that part of the benefit of self-explanation comes from the content (which could be provided elsewhere) while a second aspect comes from the unique process of generating an explanation oneself (prompting the student to recognise links between the knowledge or skills they’ve learned, and allowing them to identity and address gaps in their understanding).</p>
<p>The researchers checked and the benefits of self-explanation are not due to the technique simply leading to more time being spent in study, though the researchers said more investigations do need to do a better job of controlling for this confound.</p>
<p>The researchers also looked to see if any particular aspects of the practice of self-explanation make a difference to its effectiveness. They found some limited evidence that a multiple-choice format (in which the student chooses a range of explanations from a list) to be the least effective, perhaps because it lacks the self-generated elaboration that is usually involved in more open-ended self-explanation.</p>
<p>On this last point, the researchers suggested that the ideal degree of guidance and prompting (such as whether learners are cued to self-explain specific concepts or left to choose) may depend on their proficiency: as students develop their knowledge and skill, the more freedom to choose what and how they self-explain, the better.</p>
<p>Regarding other factors – such as, the timing of the self-explanation in the learning process; the kind of self-explanation that was elicited (such as justifying an argument or explaining a concept); the nature of the to-be-learned material; the subject matter; and how knowledge was subsequently tested – the researchers found little evidence that any of this made much difference to the benefit of self-explanation. One exception was that it was generally less effective when students were asked to self-explain their own state of knowledge and understanding (a form of so-called “meta-cognitive explanation”), which is logical because this would not involve the student elaborating on and forming connections among the to-be-learned material.</p>
<p>Bisra and her colleagues said that a “major implication” of their findings was that “…beneficial effects of inducing self-explanation seem to be available for most subject areas studied in school, and for both conceptual (declarative) and procedural knowledge.”</p>
<p>The results of this meta-analysis provide an encouraging and straightforward take-away for learners and teachers alike. Just one gripe: I would have liked to see more detailed discussion of the exact kinds of other study technique that self-explanation was compared against, to better identify any unique “ingredients” that make self-explanation apparently so effective. In fairness, Bisra and her colleagues recognise this knowledge gap, concluding: “There is now a need for clearer mapping of the unique cognitive benefits self-explanation may promote, the specific effects of different types of self-explanations and prompts, and how self-explanation might be optimally combined and sequenced with other instructional features such as extended practice, explanation modeling, and inquiry-based learning.”</p>
