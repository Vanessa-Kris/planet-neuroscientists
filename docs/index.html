<p>"Having lots of options is a wonderful thing – right up until you have to pick one.  Have you ever been torn among the two dozen entrées on a restaurant menu? Blanched at the sight of 120 different sedans on a used-car lot? If you have, you might also wonder how on earth you’re going to choose a journal to grace with your latest manuscript.  There are, quite literally, thousands of scientific journals out there – probably tens of thousands – and even within a single field there will be hundreds of options.  (Scimago lists 352 journals in ecology, for example, but that list is far from comprehensive.) What follows are some of things I think you might consider when you choose a journal.  There’s  no single “right” choice for any manuscript, because there are multiple factors at play and how you weight them will depend on things like your career stage, your budget, your coauthors, and more.  But a little systematic thought can at least narrow the field. By the way: I’m pretty sure that parts of this post will make some people very, very angry.  I’ll be mentioning impact factor, and open-access publication, and a couple of other things, and I may not stick entirely to the sacredly anointed proper positions on them.  Failure to stick to those sacredly anointed proper positions seems to provoke incoherent rage rather than thoughtful argument in a few people.  If you’re one of those people, you might prefer to read something else.  Here’s one of my least controversial posts....</p>

<p>Open-access vs. subscription. There are two fundamentally different ways in which journals distribute papers. If your paper is published “open-access”, it’s released free (online) to anyone at any time; but if your paper is in a subscription journal, it’s released (directly) only to those who pay for a journal subscription***.  (To make this a little more complicated, many subscription journals have open-access publishing options, although usually at substantial cost.)  It seems like an obvious proposition that open-access is better, and all else being equal, it would be.  All else is rarely equal.  Publication costs must be recouped one way or the other, so open-access publication is generally more expensive than subscription-based publication.  A decision to publish open-access, then, is a decision to forgo spending the same research dollars elsewhere.  Which brings us to…..."</p>

<p>On 15 and 16 June 2018, one of four OERcamps organized in Germany took place at the vocational school for media and communication (BMK) in Hamburg: the OERcamp Nord 2018. The TUHH library was represented with the project "Open scientific work".</p>

<p>What is an OERcamp?</p>

<p>Behind the term is a meeting for creators and multipliers of free learning and teaching materials, which are published under open and open licenses (Open Educational Resources). The program is not dominated by frontal lectures but numerous practical workshops. The variety of topics is great. There were workshops on active media design, cultural change at universities and technology potential in the context of the actual OER production. From general introductions to various topics to more in-depth discussions, participants can put together their program according to individual interests. In the session part you can bring in your own questions and ideas and discuss them with other camp participants.</p>

<p>The tub. has participated this year in the OERcamp North program with the workshop "Open University: Shaping the Future Together". In the course of the workshop, various projects of the Hamburg Open Online University (HOOU) illustrated possible answers to the question "What can 'university open' mean?"

<p>Google English: "Are repositories the way to open access?</p>

<p>If it is up to the big scientific funds, short-term research must be completely open and accessible to everyone. For the open access discussion, this means, among other things, that publications, theses and inaugural speeches must be made accessible. More than once large online repositories are designated as a solution, but are they?</p>

<p>The European Commission recently presented the new plans for the successor of Horizon 2020 . These plans show that it is serious about the intention to make the scientific process more transparent and accessible. Between 2521 and 2027, no less than € 25.8 billion will be made available for open science. At the national level, NWO also plays a major role in its new open science strategy , based on the conviction that this will improve the innovative power.</p>

<p>Open science does not only mean that articles are freely accessible, but also methods, data, software, peer review and teaching materials. A substantial amount of (research) data, which in one way or another will have to be shared with each other. NWO explains the following about how this should be done: "Open Science requires a new infrastructure with data repositories for the storage of research data in a safe and reliable manner."</p>

<p>A major job that first of all raises the question of what exactly is meant by a repository. What makes a repository different from a large hard disk? Which standards does it have to meet to really add value? And the next not insignificant question: who keeps it? Who is responsible?..."</p>

<p>"Abstract</p>

<p>Background</p>

<p>Platforms for sharing genomic and phenotype data have been developed to promote genomic research, while maximizing the utility of existing datasets and minimizing the burden on participants. The value of genomic analysis of trios or family members has increased, especially in rare diseases and cancers. This article aims to argue the necessity of protection when sharing data from both patients and family members.</p>

<p>Main text</p>

<p>Sharing patients’ and family members’ data collectively raises an ethical tension between the value of datasets and the rights of participants, and increases the risk of re-identification. However, current data-sharing policies have no specific safeguards or provisions for familial data sharing. A quantitative survey conducted on 10,881 general adults in Japan indicated that they expected stronger protection mechanisms when their family members’ clinical and/or genomic data were shared together, as compared to when only their data were shared. A framework that respects decision-making and the right of withdrawal of participants, including family members, along with ensuring usefulness and security of data is needed. To enable this, we propose recommendations on ancillary safeguards for familial data sharing according to the stakeholders, namely, initial researchers, genomic researchers, data submitters, database operators, institutional review boards, and the public and participants.</p>

<p>Conclusions</p>

<p>Families have played significant roles in genetic research, and its value is re-illuminated in the era of genomic medicine. It is important to make progress in data sharing while simultaneously protecting the privacy and interests of patients and families, and return its benefits to them.</p>

<p>"DH6033: Conceptual Introduction to Digital Humanities</p>

<p>Name: Gillian Morrissey                                             </p>

<p>In the pursuit of the development of knowledge, academic scholars need regular and easy access to relevent, independent and scholarly literature. By it’s very nature and functionality this literature is seen as interdisciplinary. It is also defined as expensive, of a global nature and has digital applications. Increasingly it is more difficult to access specific sites using licence restrictions. These restrictions do not just apply to members of the public who face problematic stone walling in securing knowledge. it is indiscriminate in nature, as even scholars at the most prestigious universities find accessing certain literature problematic. As a result of their status, they have some access, while the poorest in society have little or no access at all. The prevalance of Google and other internet sites have seen certain types of sites opened up under the pressures to create an open community with unlimited access. This was not a societal inclusion issue, internet sites and other forums of information provision would not charge for access to specific sites, but users would be bombarded with adverts for products and services they didn’t want or need which were related to specific searches. So, in that respect open access was not entirely open or free without obligation. There is no suggestion that fundamental changes will be made to the traditional scholarly communications system. Alterations made are done with the objective of transforming its limited availabilty of site technology in the digital environment. A major problem in the last few years has been the adoption of a core definition of what open access actually meanas in theoretical/practical terms. There is no universally accepted definition as such. The difficulty is that the concept is an evolving one. It is also subjective and means different things to different people. In 2001, The Budapest Open Initiative defined open access..."</p>

<p>"Jaime Adams and Anne Mims Adrian, PhD shares their views on advancing open access and open data in higher education</p>

<p>Every year, the U.S. Government provides billions of dollars to U.S. universities to conduct scientific research. In 2013, the U.S. Government began the process to increase public access to the results of research funded by the federal government, to ensure these results were made available to the American taxpayer. Opening research results may lead to many advancements, including accelerating scientific discovery, stimulating innovation, reducing duplication of effort and enhancing economic growth and job creation. As the U.S. Government continues to fine-tune open access requirements, many universities are finding themselves at a crossroads. U.S. universities often receive funding from various sources including the U.S. Government. Many funders are instituting open data requirements, which often vary creating a very challenging situation. To explore the issue further, a consortium of universities from around the world known as Presidents United to Solve Hunger – or PUSH – conducted a study assessing open access and open data policies and practices...."</p>

The organization reminds is that we face the challenge of feeding nearly 10 billion people by 2050. What is open data? Open data is data that is freely available to anyone in terms of its use (the chance to apply analytics to it) and rights to republish without restrictions from copyright, patents or other mechanisms of control.

<p>"In the preprint version of her chapter on the performance of Twitter as a metric of scholarly impact that scientific articles have, which Stefanie Haustein wrote for the Handbook of Quantitative Science and Technology Research, a discussion on the validity of altmetrics is broached.</p>

<p>Guest-authoring a post, published on June 12, 2018, for the Altmetric Blog, Stefanie Haustein, an information science scholar from the University of Ottawa and Université du Québec à Montréal, Canada, has drawn attention to the mixed findings on the connection between Twitter mentions and citation counts of recently published articles. While social media, such as Facebook, can be assumed to contribute to the visibility of scientific research results, the collection of essays on Internet-based indicators for the impact of science edited by Wolfgang Glänzel, Henk Moed, Ulrich Schmoch and Mike Thelwall, to be published later in 2018, incidentally opens the discussion on the degree to which altmetrics can be helpful for the assessment of article-level impact. This can be related to a relatively minor degree, estimated to range from 10% to 15%, to which Twitter is taken up by scholars. Moreover, as is characteristic of other social networks, Twitter use continues to be informal, rather than professional, for the majority of its contributors and audience, which can contribute to the nascence of its utilization for increasing the visibility of scholarly articles. Thus, whereas according to the non-representative, mixed-method study of Jason Priem and Kaithlin Light Costello published in October 2010, in which 28 scholars took part and 46,515 tweets were analyzed, scientists tend to make an indirect use of Twitter for article citation, based on the quantitative empirical findings of Stefanie Haustein, Rodrigo Costas and Vincent Larivière published on March 17, 2015, Twitter is the most important social media platform for spreading the word about academic publications...."</p>

<p>"With the recent announcement by the MIT libraries and the Royal Society of Chemistry (RSC), the “read and publish” (RAP) model has come to the U.S. We have seen this model or close variants (“publish and read”) before, in Europe, where national consortia have been working toward “flipping” traditional models to fully open access (OA) models. In such models, institutions and consortia pay a fee to make all their authors’ work immediately OA. We should expect to see more deals like this. (See Roger Schonfeld’s post on some of the limitations on a full and speedy rollout.) Indeed, this would appear to be the implication of the quotation ascribed to Emma Wilson of RSC in the press release: We are a not-for-profit publisher of high-quality chemical science content, our aim is to sustainably disseminate this research and information. As part of our commitment to sustainable open access publishing, we work with individual institutions to agree [sic] content deals specific to their needs. My personal alarm system, which is designed to provide an early warning when idealists and utopians are in the neighborhood, was triggered by the word “sustainable,” and so I placed a call to my old friend, the God of Unintended Consequences, to see what he has in store for us...."</p>

<p>Transmission of signals within the brain is essential for cognitive function, but it is not clear how neural circuits support reliable and accurate signal propagation over a sufficiently large dynamic range. Two modes of propagation have been studied: synfire chains, in which synchronous activity travels through feedforward layers of a neuronal network, and the propagation of fluctuations in firing rate
across these layers. In both cases, a sufficient amount of noise, which was added to previous models from an external source, had to be included to support stable propagation. Sparse, randomly connected networks of spiking model neurons can generate chaotic patterns of activity. We investigate whether this activity, which is a more realistic noise source, is sufficient to allow for signal transmission. We find that, for rate-coded signals but not for synfire chains, such networks support robust and accurate signal reproduction through up to six layers if appropriate adjustments are made in synaptic strengths. We investigate the factors affecting transmission and show that multiple signals can propagate simultaneously along different pathways. Using this feature, we show how different types of logic gates can arise within the architecture of the random network through the strengthening of specific synapses.</p>

                <h4><a href="http://brainblogger.com/2018/06/20/are-dyslexics-more-entrepreneurial/">Are Dyslexics More Entrepreneurial?</a></h4>

<p>Dyslexia is rather common: it is estimated that around 5-10% of individuals are dyslexic. Despite an apparent disability, some are famous, like Tom Cruise or Richard Branson. Obviously, they do not suffer from a lack of intelligence and are, in fact, quite successful in the business world. So what is going on in their brains? Are they developing some compensatory mechanisms that help them to do things better?</p>
<p>Epidemiological research studies indicate that dyslexics develop coping strategies to compensate for their weaknesses, which helps them in later life. The resilience that they acquire while in school often helps them to be more successful in developing a business, in being an entrepreneur.</p>
<p>Statistics show that there are twice more dyslexics among entrepreneurs when compared to the general population. However, dyslexics are uncommon in higher management. They also tend to have a different business management style. Thus, they do better in startups and are better at handling particular types of businesses.</p>
<p>Dyslexia is usually first identified when a child goes to school and struggles with scrambled text. Dyslexic children have difficulty in reading texts, interpreting them, and explaining the meaning of the text to others, even though they can be very intelligent otherwise. Dyslexia often results in poor academic performance, undue pressure, and psychological trauma. Each dyslexic child needs to learn to cope with these challenges.</p>
<p>Although dyslexic children are as intelligent as their peers at school, they are often labeled as less capable. Children with dyslexia are often targets of <a href="http://brainblogger.com/2015/07/03/school-bullying-forgive-ignore-or-revenge/">bullying in school</a>. Poor self-image at school often leads to worsening of self-esteem in many of these kids. As helping dyslexic children is not easy, they are often left to themselves.</p>
<h2>What’s going on in the dyslexic brain? Neurological basis of dyslexia</h2>
<p>As a common disorder, dyslexia is the subject of multiple studies. Researchers agree that those living with dyslexia may have differences in the brain relative to non-dyslexic children, and these differences are the subject of intense clinical research. The recent explosion in brain imaging technology is helping us gain a deeper understanding of the matter.</p>
<p>The neurological theory of dyslexia is one of the earliest. The theory was proposed about a century ago when British physicians Morgan and Hinshelwood described dyslexia as a “visual word blindness.”</p>
<p>The study of adults <a href="http://brainblogger.com/2008/07/14/living-with-traumatic-brain-injury/">living with brain trauma</a> in the left parietal region demonstrated that many of these people develop reading difficulties. They find it challenging to process the optical image of letters. Thus, the early theory was that those with dyslexia have developmental defects in the parietal region of the brain.</p>
<p>Left parietal involvement was also somewhat confirmed during pathological examination of the brains of those who died at an earlier age and were known to be dyslexic. </p>
<p>Another important theory focuses on delayed brain lateralization in dyslexia. It is thought that some people have weak or insufficient brain lateralization that hinders the understanding of languages. This theory was the subject of multiple studies in the second half of last century.</p>
<p>The latest research into the neurophysiology of those living with dyslexia seems to indicate that dyslexia is phonological in nature: dyslexics have difficulty in manipulating the phoneme parts of speech. It is possible that there are developmental issues in the visual tract or other visual mechanisms in the brain may be contributing to the difficulty.</p>
<p>Apart from defects in a specific subsystem of the vision pathway, researchers think that there are other brain developmental issues involved as well. It is entirely possible that people with dyslexia have temporal processing impairment, and therefore they are not able to process information fast enough. Thus, dyslexia is considered the result of multi-system deficits</p>
<p><strong>In conclusion</strong></p>
<p>Dyslexia is probably the result of deficits in the brain at multiple levels. There is an impaired phoneme discrimination resulting in difficulty in understanding spelling. Visual perceptual impairment leads to further worsening of word recognition, and phonological awareness impairment causes speech disturbances. In the center of all this is delayed temporal processing. The end result is delayed speech development, difficulties in reading and comprehending texts, and poor academic performance.</p>
<h2>What makes a dyslexic a successful person?</h2>
<p>From Leonardo da Vinci to Einstein, <a href="http://brainblogger.com/2015/04/16/opening-the-classroom-door-for-children-with-autism/">children with learning disabilities</a> prove that there is a limited link between disability and intelligence. Children with dyslexia are at least equally intelligent to non-dyslexic children.</p>
<p>The higher success of individuals with dyslexia in certain professions is probably the result of resilience or compensatory mechanisms that they cultivate during the school days to overcome their difficulties.</p>
<p>Some of these kids may develop better skills for interacting with others. They may focus more on specific arts or sciences. Many of them may not concentrate on studies and instead start doing business at an early age. This means that they can be found in any profession, and in the long run they are equally successful.</p>
<p>The compensatory mechanisms developed at a young age may provide an edge over others in specific areas when the children grow up. Even though dyslexics may score poorly in school, they may outscore other children in practical life since they spend more time perfecting their verbal skills.</p>
<p>As an entrepreneur, dyslexics are known to be good at delegating tasks, they are excellent mentors, and they are often creative. All of these qualities usually make them more successful entrepreneurs, though they may not be that good in roles where there is less space for creativity.</p>
<p>Achieving success with dyslexia is perhaps about learning different skills, mastering different approaches to solving the tasks, and developing strategies to compensate for certain limitations. </p>

<p>Aerobic exercise – any activity that gets your heart pumping harder – improves <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2017/04/19/10-ways-that-running-changes-your-mind-and-brain/">mood, anxiety and memory.</a> It can help people with major depressive disorder, bipolar disorder and anxiety disorder. Now there’s evidence, from a <a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyt.2018.00167/full">randomised controlled trial</a> published in <i>Frontiers in Psychiatry</i>, that a programme of regular aerobic exercise also reduces psychopathology in people diagnosed with schizophrenia. And it seems to have a particular impact on so-called “negative” symptoms, such as apathy and loss of emotional feeling, which are <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25528757">not improved by standard drug treatments</a>.</p>
<p>“[W]hile antipsychotics [drug treatments] are essential in treating schizophrenia, interventions other than antipsychotic treatment…may be needed to achieve better outcomes,” write the authors of the new study, led by Peng-Wei Wang at Kaohsiung Medical University Hospital in Taiwan.</p>
<p><span id="more-34066"></span></p>
<p>The researchers recruited 62 patients, all of whom had received a diagnosis of schizophrenia at least a year ago, and whose antipsychotic medication dosage had been stable for at least three months. These participants were randomly allocated into either an aerobic exercise group (30 minutes of “vigorous” aerobic exercise, taking into account each participant’s maximum heart rate) or a control group who performed stretching exercises (25 minutes of flexibility, toning and balance exercises), with a goal of five sessions a week, for 12 weeks. Not all participants managed to stick to the minimum requirement of three sessions per week for the full three months. But 24 in the exercise group and 22 in the control group did complete the study.  (There were no significant differences in gender make-up, age of onset of schizophrenia, or mean dosage of antipsychotics between the two groups.)</p>
<p>A psychiatrist who was blind to the group allocations used a standard schizophrenia symptom evaluation scale to interview and evaluate all the participants at the start of the study; at the end of the 12 week intervention; and again, three months on. The control group showed no improvements in positive (e.g. hallucinations and delusions) or negative symptoms, or general psychopathology, during the intervention or the follow-up period. But for the aerobic exercise group, it was a different story.</p>
<p>Over the 12-week intervention, their overall psychopathology and level of negative and positive symptoms decreased. Three months later, these improvements had been maintained (and, in the case of negative symptoms, actually continued to improve). Also, the more severe their negative symptoms and general psychopathology at the start of the study, the bigger their improvements by the end.</p>
<p>“These results imply that [aerobic exercise] could be a good non-pharmacotherapeutic intervention for antipsychotic-treated patients with schizophrenia,” the researchers conclude.</p>
<p>There are various possible explanations for the effects. Vigorous exercise can boost levels of the neurotransmitter glutamate (other work has found that enhancing glutamate function can improve negative symptoms of schizophrenia); increase levels of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (which is involved in repairing damaged brain cells and triggering the growth of new ones; low levels of BDNF are associated with symptoms of schizophrenia); and also help regulate the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis – the stress response system. “HPA dysfunction is an important characteristic in schizophrenia,” the authors note.</p>
<p>But is a one-off 12-week programme really enough to produce lasting – and even escalating – improvements?</p>
<p>The researchers did not collect data on how much exercise the aerobic group did in the three months between the end of the 12-week intervention and the final assessment. If the participants continued to exercise, this may have accounted for the ongoing improvements. Future research will have to explore this. But if an exercise programme does have to be maintained, given all the manifold benefits, surely that’s no bad thing.</p>

To illustrate, U.S. Health and Human Services (HHS) unveiled a new initiative called DRIVe (Division of Research, Innovation, and Ventures) to come up with new solutions to some of the toughest health security challenges we are faced with such as early detection of illness and sepsis. Another announcement that caught everyone’s attention was a five-year alliance between Johnson &amp; Johnson (J&amp;J) and Boston University – an attempt to change the way we detect and treat lung cancer today. J&amp;J will fund a Lung Cancer Center at Boston University Medical Center as part of this new alliance. Just as important, the Henri A. Termeer Biotechnology Visionary Award was given to Dr. Sue Desmond-Hellmann, CEO of the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation, for the innovative spirit and transformative impact on patients’ lives. This is the first-ever award created in honor of the late Genzyme CEO who was instrumental in transforming Boston into a thriving hub of life science research, development and innovation.</p><p style="font-family: 'Open Sans', brandon-grotesque, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, Arial, sans-serif; text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: bolder;">WORLD AT BIO</span></p><p style="font-family: 'Open Sans', brandon-grotesque, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, Arial, sans-serif; text-align: left;">Thousands of attendees from over 74 different countries participated in the event, and most of the essential biotech hubs and nations had a presence in the form of pavilions and summits at the event. For example, a “conference-within-a-conference” called the China Summit was one of the country-specific meetings at BIO which highlighted the complexities of the world’s second-largest biotech market, and among other vital issues focused on the importance of collaboration between U.S. and China in the scientific research and business.</p><p></p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-dnt="true" data-width="550"><p dir="ltr" lang="en">Great turnout at the China Summit at <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/BIO2018?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#BIO2018</a> - great timing too given news flow like CStone/Blueprint deal <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%24BPMC&amp;src=ctag&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">$BPMC</a> <a href="https://t.co/ST1PnJjCsJ">https://t.co/ST1PnJjCsJ</a> <a href="https://t.co/sq13t1Gpxw">pic.twitter.com/sq13t1Gpxw</a></p>— Josh Berlin (@BioPharmaJosh) <a href="https://twitter.com/BioPharmaJosh/status/1003683091515396102?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 4, 2018</a></blockquote><p></p><p style="font-family: 'Open Sans', brandon-grotesque, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, Arial, sans-serif; text-align: left;"><i>Tweet gives a</i> <i>glimpse of the China Summit.</i></p><p style="font-family: 'Open Sans', brandon-grotesque, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, Arial, sans-serif; text-align: left;"><span style="font-size: 1rem;">Canada’s presence at BIO couldn’t be ignored</span><span style="font-size: 1rem;"> </span><span style="font-size: 1rem;">either.</span><span style="font-size: 1rem;"> </span><span style="font-size: 1rem;">Economic development and tech transfer teams, businesses, scientists, and government officials from The Great White North were seen everywhere.

The organization is a non-profit spinoff of the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation — the world’s wealthiest charity. Dr. Penny Heaton described the mission and approach of the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Medical Research Institute and discussed the roles of both organizations and their strategies to combat infectious diseases globally.

During the <i>Fireside Chats</i> at <i>BIO 2018,</i> the FDA commissioner expressed his thoughts on developing lower-cost generics and biosimilars. He also shed light on other things such as gene therapy, the opioid crisis, more opportunities for patients, and the new Right to Try law.</p><p style="font-family: 'Open Sans', brandon-grotesque, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, Arial, sans-serif; text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: bolder;">SPOTTED INNOVATIONS</span><span style="font-weight: bolder;"><br /></span>Many innovative technologies and businesses also caught our attention. To illustrate, innovations like real-time patient monitoring, video collaboration tools, 3D cell cultures, AI-enabled knowledge databases, microfluidic platforms, virtual reality 3D molecular visualization, and new inventive liquid biopsy technologies were big head-turners at the event.</p><p style="font-family: 'Open Sans', brandon-grotesque, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, Arial, sans-serif; text-align: left;">In addition, we learned about new innovative initiatives by biotech companies, big and small alike. One such company is Recombinetics; they employ gene-editing technology not just to improve human health but also to improve the health, well-being and productivity of animals. The company’s gene-editing technology can potentially be used to create animals with welfare traits, such as pigs that don’t need to be castrated, hornless cattle, heat-tolerant livestock and other disease-resistant animals.  </p><p style="font-family: 'Open Sans', brandon-grotesque, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, Arial, sans-serif; text-align: left;">Another example is Alnylam Pharmaceuticals. In his “Bio Buzz” Interview, John Maraganore, the company’s CEO, talked about an entirely new class of medicines derived from the Nobel Prize-winning discovery of advances in RNA interference (RNAi). With investigational RNAi therapeutics, it is possible to block the production of disease-causing proteins.</p><p style="font-family: 'Open Sans', brandon-grotesque, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, Arial, sans-serif; text-align: left;">Just as important, Amgen shared its approach to treating migraines. The company believes a new method of theirs can treat a problem that affects nearly one billion people across the globe – migraines!</p><p style="font-family: 'Open Sans', brandon-grotesque, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, Arial, sans-serif; text-align: left;">If you couldn’t attend, we hope our coverage of this year’s BIO convention gave you a sense of its scale, history and importance.</p></div>

<p>If personality traits are a genuine concept and not merely an artefact of psychologists’ imagination, then how people choose to spend their time ought to correlate with their scores on personality questionnaires, notwithstanding the constraints of life that prevent us from doing what we want. In fact, there are relatively few studies that have looked at correlations between traits and everyday behaviour, and of those that have, many relied on student volunteers (see <a href="http://www.bbc.com/future/story/20170518-the-everyday-habits-that-reveal-our-personalities">here</a> for an overview).</p>
<p>A <a href="https://www.collabra.org/articles/10.1525/collabra.112/">study</a> published earlier this year in <em>Collabra</em> helps plug this research gap – Julia Rohrer and Richard Lucas analysed the “Big Five” trait personality scores of over 1,300 German volunteers (part of a nationally representative sample), average age 51 years, who on three successive years completed detailed diaries of what they had been up to the day before. Specifically, they indicated whether they had spent any time, and if so how much, on nine key activities the previous day, including socialising, work, chores and watching TV.</p>
<p><span id="more-34060"></span></p>
<p>The findings, controlling for age and gender, will mostly make comfortable reading for personality psychologists. For instance, consistent with trait theory, high scorers on conscientiousness spent more time working and studying, whether they were full-time employed or not. Similarly, strong extraverts, the highly agreeable and open-minded were more likely to report socialising.</p>
<p>A few other findings are more nuanced and intriguing. For instance, the highly conscientiousness were no more or less likely to report watching TV the previous day, but they reported watching it for less time. Meanwhile, extraversion, emotional stability, agreeableness and conscientiousness all went together with less time spent reading. In contrast, openness to experience was correlated with reading, and a trend toward reading for longer. Openness also correlated with time spent playing sports. Cultural activities, which typically correlate with openness, were not assessed in this study.</p>

<p>The most intriguing findings concerned chores – against trait theory, the highly conscientiousness were no more likely to say they’d spent time on chores (even though orderliness is a key facet of conscientiousness), perhaps because they had everything in order already, whereas the highly neurotic (i.e. people with low emotional stability who typically experience more low moods) were more likely to say they’d done some chores the previous day, and for longer. Again it’s speculation, but perhaps this is because the emotionally unstable find disorder and clutter more upsetting, while at the same time not necessarily being particularly adept at keeping order.</p>
<p>There was also a trend toward agreeableness correlating with doing chores. This chimes with a <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0191886917303094">previous study</a> that found, more specifically, that agreeableness correlated with spending more time ironing and washing up. The likely explanation in both cases is that highly agreeable people are more concerned with doing things that benefit others.</p>
<p>The approach of asking people whether they’d performed an activity at all, and if so, for how long, also threw up some interesting contradictions. For instance, high scorers on openness were more likely to report socialising, yet at the same time, they tended to report doing so for less time than low scorers, perhaps because they had so many other competing demands on their time.</p>
<p>The main weakness of this new data is its reliance (as in so much personality research) on people’s self-reports of their traits and behaviour, and the memory challenge for them of recalling what they’d been doing the previous day and for how long. Nonetheless, the findings serve to complement similar efforts using different approaches. “Our study suggests that even under the constraints of everyday life, personality shows modest [effect sizes were in the range of .1 to .2] but meaningful associations with daily patterns,” Rohrer and Lucas concluded. “Personality therefore qualifies as a real-world phenomenon, exerting its influence beyond the context of the research laboratory and allowing for strong descriptions of human life.”</p>

<p>Psychology can help people one person at a time, but it also holds the promise of changing society at a mass scale, through campaigns to change attitudes and behaviour. One such endeavour is the development of programmes to reduce the rates of sexual assault of women on university campuses. But in a <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1359178917303646">literature review</a> in <em>Aggression and Violent Behavior</em>, researchers from the University of California make the case that such programmes may not just be ineffective, but counterproductive.</p>
<p><span id="more-34047"></span></p>
<p>In 2013 the US passed its Violence Against Women Act; in response most US university campuses launched programmes that aimed to reduce sexual assault by raising awareness, changing attitudes and behaviours and encouraging bystanders to take a stand. But there has been little systematic evaluation of these programmes, and the evidence for any benefits is thus far thin. Of the 140 college-based behaviour change programmes studied by the Center for Disease Control, it recommended only three on the balance of evidence; all three focused on changing bystander action and two of the three merely showed “promise of effectiveness”. Other reviews have produced slightly more positive conclusions but often with weak effects or without evidence of actual behaviour change.</p>

<p>It’s certainly become clear that well-meaning interventions in other contexts can have the opposite effect to that intended; we’ve previously covered instances of backfiring interventions that aimed to <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2016/07/08/the-imagined-contact-intervention-for-reducing-prejudice-can-backfire/">reduce prejudice</a>, <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2015/02/23/the-backfire-effect-correcting-false-beliefs-about-vaccines-can-be-surprisingly-counterproductive/">correct false beliefs on vaccine</a>, or <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2017/05/11/pressuring-employees-to-be-do-gooders-can-backfire-badly/">encourage employees to behave better in the workplace</a>.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>The reason boomerang effects are such a concern in the domain of sexual assault is that most interventions are being designed and evaluated around a broad target group – men – rather than looking at effects on the most high-risk individuals. Yet we know from previous evidence that the people most likely to respond contrarily are those most disposed to the problem behaviour in the first place. For instance, an <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0193841X16666196">intervention intended to reduce acceptance of violent video games</a> in students was effective for many participants, but post-intervention, those who had been classified as living a delinquent lifestyle became more enthusiastic about playing the games.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span><a href="http://refhub.elsevier.com/S1359-1789(17)30364-6/rf0040">Another study</a> demonstrated that an anti-violence campaign was effective in increasing opposition to violence in people low in trait aggression, but those who were highly aggressive became more enthusiastic about violence.</p>
<p>Boomerang effects seem to happen when participants experience reactance: anger stemming from the sense that a mode of life or thinking is threatened combined with “motivated reasoning” – like finding reasons to doubt the source of the message. In the midst of reactance, the person sees themselves as defiantly resisting preachy attempts to deny them their entitlement.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Is reactance likely to happen with the men most likely to commit sexual assault? Well, consider this profile of high-risk individuals: they tend to have hostility towards women, experience sexual arousal when physical force is involved, and have an impersonal sexual orientation (intimacy is not a prerequisite for what they seek in sex). As well as these sex-related factors, they tend to be anti-social, highly entitled and narcissistic. Evidence suggests these individuals are less likely to respond to cues of sexual disinterest, feeling that women are really into them or will be eventually, and they react more aggressively to interpersonal rejection. This seems a potent recipe for reactance.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

Messages promoting gender equality and greater consideration for women lead to lower aggressive tendencies for men already low in sexist attitudes, but more aggression among those who held more sexist attitudes from the start. A video intended to reduce acceptance of rape myths and increase victim empathy worked for men who had no history of sexually aggressive behaviour, but the high-risk men showed a boomerang effect. On the other hand, some experimental studies have shown some intervention content can have the desired effect on high-risk individuals, e.g. improving victim empathy. But if you hit the target on some occasions, and shoot yourself in the foot on others, you would want to take a good look at your technique before rolling it out nationwide.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>The danger is that interventions could produce impressive-seeming results simply because the low-risk majority perceive sexual assault as even more deplorable than they already did – while the (roughly 30 per cent) of higher-risk men become even more intent on their agenda. Of course, such interventions may prevent certain sexual assaults – for example, through limiting predation opportunities through galvanising bystanders to act. But surely we should be working to maximise impact on those likely to commit the bulk of the assaults, rather than fire up their motivation still further.</p>

<p>The neurotransmitter Oxytocin is widely known for its role in the regulation of social bonding as well as romantic attachment. It was initially discovered over 100 years ago after an extract derived from the human posterior pituitary gland was found to cause uterine contractions in pregnant cats. Since 1909 our understanding of this nonapeptide has somewhat progressed.</p>
<blockquote><p>Impairment of methylation appeared to suggest increased prevalence of mood and anxiety disorders.</p></blockquote>
<p>Oxytocin binds a G protein coupled receptor that is coded for by the OXTR gene. Binding of oxytocin to its receptor unleashes a signalling cascade within the cell, leading to both psychological and physiological changes.  Much attention has been given to the OXTR gene as its expression essentially controls the rate limiting step in the oxytocin signalling process.</p>
<p>A meta-analysis published in <em>BMC Psychiatry</em> this month looks at the possibility of a link between OXTR gene methylation and corresponding changes in social and emotional behaviour in human populations.</p>
<p>While there is still insufficient evidence to draw strong conclusions, early findings point towards a correlation between specific elevated patterns of methylation and impaired cognitive and social emotional behaviour. Conversely, impairment of methylation appeared to suggest increased prevalence of mood and anxiety disorders.</p>
<p>To establish these patterns with greater certainty, more research is required to understand the relationship between OXTR gene methylation and OXTR expression.</p>
<p><strong><em>BMC Public Health</em>: <a href="https://bmcpublichealth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12889-018-5399-4">Sound pressure levels generated at risk volume steps of portable listening devices: types of smartphone and genres of music.</a> </strong></p>
<p><img alt="" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-10261" height="201" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2018/06/headphones-300x201.jpg" width="300" />It is thought that approximately 36% of the world’s population currently use a smart phone, with around 2.1 billion worldwide users reported in 2016. A significant number of these smartphone owning individuals are likely to take advantage of music playing applications found ubiquitously across most smartphone models.</p>
<p>However, listening to music on a smartphone or personal listening device comes with a risk.</p>
<p>The World Health Organisation (WHO) have warned many young adults are at risk of developing recreational noise induced hearing loss due to frequent exposure to noisy environments. It is thought that nearly 50% of young people aged from 12- 35 years of age in developed counties are exposed to dangerously high levels of music through their personal listening devices.</p>
<p>Smartphone manufacturers have now implemented their own recommendations for minimum volumes at which hearing loss may occur. However these volumes vary, even within different smartphone models issued by the same company.</p>
<p>In <em>BMC Public Health</em>, authors Gibbeum Kim and Woojae Han put 6 smartphones to the test, using four genres of Korean pop music to determine the first risk volume level as defined by each device.</p>
<p>The results indicated a considerable 8-dB difference in sound pressure levels detected across the six devices, with dance-pop music having the highest output level of the genres tested. Based on these conclusions, the implementation of an international standard for safe use output volume is suggested across all devices.</p>
<p><em><strong>BMC International Health and Human Rights:</strong></em> <strong><u><a href="https://bmcinthealthhumrights.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12914-018-0160-8">Causes of death among street-connected children and youth in Eldoret, Kenya.</a></u></strong></p>
<p>It is common knowledge that homeless people will have lower life expectancy on average than their housed and settled counterparts. One recent study estimated the homeless youth of San Francisco to have a mortality rate that was 10 times that of the general population. Drug related deaths and suicide featured as the most common causes.</p>
<p>However, little information exists on the causes of youth mortality in low and middle-income countries. A recent study published <em>in BMC International Health and Human Rights</em> has documented the causes of death among street connected youth in Eldoret, Western Kenya.</p>
<p>The causes of death of in Eldoret differ considerably from those in San Francisco. In Eldoret, HIV accounted for 37% of all deaths, killing 59% of females included in the study and roughly a quarter of all men. Among the male population, the greatest cause of death was assault, accounting for nearly 50% of recorded deaths in men.</p>
<p>Deaths for reasons such as these are largely preventable. The authors advocate appropriate responses such as targeted HIV treatment programs and child protection systems to decrease the prevalence of assault and HIV and thus avoidable youth mortality in these areas.</p>
<p><strong><em>BMC Evolutionary Biology:</em><u><a href="https://bmcevolbiol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12862-018-1155-8">Phylogenomic analysis of Apoidea sheds new light on the sister group of bees</a></u></strong></p>
<p><img alt="" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-10262" height="298" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2018/06/wasp-300x298.jpg" width="300" />This study published in <em>BMC Evolutionary Biology</em> investigates the evolutionary history of apoidea, a superfamily that includes apoid wasps and bees. A barrier to understanding the evolution of apoidea has been the difficulty in determining the geological age of bees as well as their phylogenetic origin.</p>
<p>Michael Ohl’s group from the Institute for Evolution and Biodiversity Science in Berlin have pooled and analysed target DNA enrichment sites and transcriptomic sequence data, covering all major lineages in the apoidea superfamily.</p>
<p>The Ammoplanina, a family of predatory wasps, began to lose their taste for thrips around 128 million years ago. Over time, they acquired a plant-based diet and evolved into what we now know as the modern bee. Further research must be done to understand the specific traits that enabled this radical dietary change.</p>
<p><strong><em>BMC Medical Ethics: </em><u><a href="https://bmcmedethics.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12910-018-0268-3">Conscientious objection to participation in abortion by midwives and nurses: a systematic review of reasons</a></u></strong></p>
<p>Enshrined in the European Convention on Human Rights, is the right to freedom of thought conscience and religion. The freedom to manifest these beliefs, however, can be limited by law if thought to pose a risk to public health for example, or infringe on the rights and freedoms of others.</p>
<blockquote><p>Conscientious objection was widely accepted, despite largely polarised viewpoints on either side of the debate.</p></blockquote>
<p>Under most abortion laws enacted across the developed world, a conscience clause is included, permitting the conscientious objection of healthcare professionals to opt out of providing such services on moral grounds.</p>
<p>Heated debate has ensued regarding the extent to which the rights of healthcare professionals to refuse provision of abortion services should be limited, in case this should infringe on a woman’s legal right to the service.</p>
<p>This review, published in <em>BMC Medical Ethics</em>, aims to elucidate the reasons given for declining to participate in abortion on grounds of conscience. Surprisingly, it was found the viewpoints of midwives and nurses were largely absent from this debate, despite being the recommended providers of abortion services by the WHO. Across the literature studied, conscientious objection was widely accepted, despite largely polarised viewpoints on either side of the debate.</p>
<p>Going forward, better representation of all relevant healthcare professionals in the debate and the consideration of all viewpoints is necessary when discussing such a sensitive topic, in order to inform beneficial health policy in this area.</p>

<figure class="wp-caption alignleft" id="attachment_10263" style="width: 310px;"><img alt="" class="size-medium wp-image-10263" height="267" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2018/06/skull-300x267.gif" width="300" /><div class="attachment-image--caption">Image taken from manuscript</div><div class="attachment-image--source"></div></figure>
<p>Between the ages of 35 to 44, 69% of US citizens are reported to have lost at least one tooth. 15 million of this population will have undergone crown and bridge replacements for missing teeth, while only 3 million of these have been reported to have had dental implants. However this number is said to be growing by half a million every year.</p>
<p>Dental implants may be surgically inserted into a patient’s jaw, in order to support the introduction of a prosthetic element such as a crown or bridge. Cone beam computed tomography (CBCT) is a useful tool, providng high-quality, 3-dimensional images of surrounding tissues to aid this process. The low cost and reasonable dose of radiation administered has caused the popularity of this method to increase over recent years.</p>
<p>In <em>BMC Oral Health</em> this month, Michael Bornstein’s group from the University of Leuven in Belgium review current literature to provide recommendations for the future use of CBCT imaging. Due to relatively high radiation doses, its clinical usage should be justified. For example, the authors advise to limit CBCT to cases involving post-operative complications following dental implant insertion, as well as the avoidance of this procedure in long term maintenance and follow up of dental implants.</p>
<p>A lack of standardisation of radiation dose and image quality between different CBCT machines further prompted calls for more research to consistently achieve the lowest diagnostically acceptable radiation dose possible.</p>

                <h4><a href="http://brainblogger.com/2018/06/18/how-weather-influences-the-brain/">How Weather Influences the Brain?</a></h4>

<p>We all know that the weather can strongly influence our mood and productivity. Many people feel better when the weather is nice and sunny. It is thus not surprising that people more often feel unhappy and depressed in winter. There is even a medical condition known as <a href="http://brainblogger.com/2016/02/08/winter-depression-new-discoveries-in-treatment-of-seasonal-affective-disorder/">winter depression</a>. Still, some researchers believe that our brain functions better during the cold days. In this article, I’ll briefly analyze what happens in our brain in relation to weather-related mood and mind changes.</p>
<p>Scientific studies indicate that weather conditions such as high temperature and humidity can impair mental performance by affecting brain neurochemistry. For instance, it is believed that thermal stress can cause cognitive impairment.</p>
<p>One recent study has investigated the impact of thermal stress on cognitive functions in soldiers spending at least one year in desert conditions. The evaluation of memory and cognitive functions indicated there is a decline in cognitive performance in hot climates when compared to normal weather. The decline was most pronounced for attention, concentration, verbal memory, and psychomotor performance.</p>
<p>Another recent study has investigated the impact of sand and dust storms on children’s cognitive function. Using mathematical analysis and word-recognition test scores, how prenatal exposure to sand and dust storms affects the <a href="http://brainblogger.com/2017/12/13/how-does-starting-school-early-impact-educational-attainment/">cognitive performance of children </a>was evaluated. The authors found a decline in both test scores, as well as a later beginning of counting and speaking in whole sentences in children prenatally exposed to storms. The findings imply that this kind of weather jeopardizes the cognitive functions of the next generation.</p>
<p>However, results from scientific research on the effects of temperature on cognitive functions are quite mixed and contradictory.</p>
<p>One study investigated <a href="http://brainblogger.com/2014/09/13/how-temperature-affects-people-with-multiple-sclerosis/">how temperature affects the cognitive performance of subjects with multiple sclerosis</a>. Healthy subjects were included as controls. The researchers correlated cognitive status with temperature in both study groups. In patients with multiple sclerosis, unlike in healthy subjects, the higher temperatures were associated with worsening cognitive status. These findings confirmed that warmer outdoor temperatures lead to a higher incidence of clinical exacerbation and T2 lesion activity in subjects with this condition (T2 lesions represent the white spots observed by MRI that are used to diagnose and track the progress of multiple sclerosis).</p>
<p>With regard to cognitive functions in cold weather, studies have shown both impairments and improvements.</p>
<p>For instance, one study investigated the impact of exposure to the cold and the following rewarming on working memory and executive functions in 10 young males. The results demonstrated a decline in the test results when the subjects were exposed to 10°C, and these impairments persisted for one hour during the rewarming period. Although the underlying mechanisms were not tested, the authors suggested that acute vascular changes in the brain could explain the observed changes. According to the authors, another explanation could be a deregulation of catecholamine levels, particularly important for complex attentional functions.</p>
<p>Other findings suggest that winter helps to wake up our mind and makes us think more clearly. It is well known that the brain utilizes glucose as its main energy source. Thus, when glucose is depleted, brain functioning is jeopardized. Energy, i.e., glucose, is also used for the regulation of body temperature, especially in extremely hot or cold conditions. It seems that more energy (glucose) is needed to cool down than to warm up the body. Thus, warm temperatures are more likely to deplete glucose levels and thus impair brain function and clarity of thinking.</p>
<p>It has been suggested that high temperatures increase the risk of mental disorders, especially in the elderly.</p>
<p>One recent study has analyzed data on emergency admissions linked to mental diseases and daily temperatures over a period of more than 10 years in 6 different cities. The results indicated that high temperatures might jeopardize mental health and be responsible for the exacerbation of symptoms of mental diseases. For instance, according to the results, more than 30% of admissions for anxiety were attributed to hot temperatures. Exposure to hot temperatures leads to reactions in the body that may cause an increase in stress hormone levels and brain temperature. Additionally, extremely hot weather may deregulate the <a href="http://brainblogger.com/2018/01/10/tryptophan-in-mood-anxiety-and-depression/">dopamine and serotonin levels</a> (these neuromediators are important for the feeling of happiness).</p>
<p>According to widespread belief, weather can affect our mood. Although a lack of sunshine is commonly linked to seasonal depression, some researchers believe that not all individuals respond similarly to weather changes.</p>
<p>Research has linked an individual’s self-reported daily mood with the objective weather over a 30 day period. Large individual differences have been found in how people react to the weather. Accordingly, four distinct types of weather responders have been identified: summer lovers (i.e., a better mood with warmer weather and more sun), summer haters (i.e., a worse mood with warmer weather and more sun), rain haters (i.e.,  a bad mood on rainy days), and unaffected (i.e., no particular association between weather and mood). Interestingly, adolescents and their mothers are often the same type, suggestive of familial weather reactivity.</p>
<p>The analysis of both scientific and popular literature permits the conclusion that extreme weather conditions can affect our cognitive function and mood. Most likely, this is caused by a decline in the brain’s energy source (glucose), which needs to be used for thermoregulation. Also, it is evident that extreme temperatures affect the level of catecholamines in the brain (such as dopamine and serotonin). Still, it seems that there is some individual variability in the brain’s response to weather, and it may run in the family.</p>

<p>From <i>You’ve Lost that Lovin’ Feeling</i> to <i>Nothing Compares 2 U</i>, there’s no shortage of songs about heartbreak. None, I suspect, contains the line, “Now it’s time to give negative reappraisal a go.” But whether you’ve just been dumped or you’ve done the dumping, if you’re still in love with your ex, this could be your best strategy for falling out of love and moving on, according to a <a href="http://psycnet.apa.org/buy/2017-37800-001">new paper</a> published in the <em>Journal of Experimental Psychology</em>.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>“Romantic break-ups can have serious consequences including insomnia, reduced immune function, broken heart syndrome, depression and suicide,” note the authors, Sandra Langeslag and Michelle Sanchez at the University of Missouri, St Louis. Strategies that help people to fall out of love could relieve the agony of unrequited love or make it easier to get out of a dysfunctional relationship.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><span id="more-34035"></span></p>
<p>Langeslag and Sanchez recruited 20 women and four men for their study. (As it was hard to get male volunteers, they decided to sacrifice gender balance in favour of having enough participants for the statistical analysis). All these people had experienced a romantic break-up, were still upset about it, and could supply 28 digital pictures of their ex. These pictures had to include a range of facial expressions, and show the ex-partner in different situations (all non-intimate), to mimic the kinds of real-world reminders the participants might endure – seeing their ex on the street, or on social media, for example.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>In the lab, the researchers showed the participants their full collection of pictures four times over. In between seeing each shot, they were prompted to engage in one of three potential strategies to down-regulate love, and then report on a sliding scale how “in love” and how generally positive or negative they felt. One strategy was “love reappraisal” (they were presented with statements such as “It’s okay to love someone I’m no longer with”, for example.) Another involved simple distractions (between photos, they were asked to think about their favourite food, for example). There was also a control, in which they were asked to think about nothing in particular. And finally, there was “negative reappraisal” which involved reminding themselves of the negative qualities of their ex partners (prompts included ‘What is an annoying habit of your ex?’ for instance).</p>
<p>While neither love reappraisal or distraction changed how in love the participants reported feeling, negative reappraisal of the ex did. Negative reappraisal also made the participants feel more negative in the moment – but such short-term discomfort may be worth enduring if this strategy helps people to get over a break-up, the researchers write.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>That is an “if”, however. As Langeslag and Sanchez concede, this study only looked at feelings of love immediately after each photo was presented. The practicalities of the strategy also remain unclear. If you know you’re going to bump into your ex at work, say, should you be focusing on their negative qualities during every commute in – or would an occasional bout of negative reappraisal have the same effect? And what exactly would using the negative reappraisal strategy mean in terms of how long it takes you to get over the relationship?<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>“To evaluate which regulation strategies would best help people cope with a break-up, it would be essential to consider both the short-term and long-term effects,” the researchers write. It will also be important to study more men.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

Over the years, we have written about a number of the sleuths who, on their own time and often at great risks to their careers or finances, have looked for issues in the scientific literature. Here’s a sampling: Elisabeth “Eagle Eyes” Bik showed that one in 25 papers she examined had evidence of inappropriate image manipulation. … <a class="more-link" href="https://retractionwatch.com/2018/06/17/meet-the-scientific-sleuths-ten-whove-had-an-impact-on-the-scientific-literature/">Continue reading <span class="screen-reader-text">Meet the scientific sleuths: A dozen who’ve had an impact on the scientific literature</span></a>

A traditional Amazonian psychedelic brew is an effective and rapid-acting antidepressant, according to a paper just published. But the new study revives some long-standing questions.



Ayahuasca is a mixture of herbs, traditionally used for spiritual and therapeutic purposes. The main active ingredients are N,N-DMT, a potent psychedelic, and several molecules that inhibit the enzyme MAO. The MAO inhibitors serve to prevent the N,N-DMT from being broken down by the digestive system, allowing

<h4>The project will focus on applying advanced imaging technologies paired with precise genetic techniques to disentangle how inhibitory circuits in the cortex are constructed.</h4>
<p>Dr. Hiroki Taniguchi, Ph.D., a Research Group Leader at the Max Planck Florida Institute for Neuroscience (MPFI) has been awarded a $2.4 million five-year grant by the National Institutes of Health (NIH). Over the life of the grant the Taniguchi Lab will take a closer look at a class of brain cells known as inhibitory interneurons, studying how members of this diverse cell type assemble into specific circuits in various regions of the cerebral cortex.</p>
<p>The cerebral cortex is arguably the brain’s most complex structure, endowing us with extraordinary abilities such as sensory perception, language, and cognition. Underlying these capabilities are the intricate connections made by the neurons that reside within, enabling complex encoding and processing of information. Interneurons in the cortex normally act to balance, refine and shape information processing, but their dysfunction has been implicated in a wide array of brain disorders such as autism, schizophrenia and epilepsy.</p>
<p>Despite their critical importance, comprehensive wiring diagrams of interneuron circuits and the exact principles that guide their assembly have remained rather elusive. One challenging aspect hindering the design of a concrete cortical blueprint, is the sheer diversity of interneurons and principle neurons they form connections with. Each individual type of interneuron is thought to make specific connections depending on a principle neuron’s location, function, and depth within the cortex. Until very recently, neuroscientists lacked readily available tools sensitive enough to study these connections at a cell-type specific resolution. Overcoming this obstacle, the Taniguchi lab has designed novel genetic tools and incorporated them into the established technique of retrograde monosynaptic labeling, producing unprecedented results.</p>
<p>Their powerful technique now allows for the precise tracing of connections from individual types of interneurons. MPFI scientists will be able to determine how inhibitory connections form during development and elucidate the organization of specific inhibitory inputs on varying types of principle neurons. Uncovering these principles will dramatically improve our understanding of cortical circuits as well as pioneer novel approaches for the diagnosis and treatment of prominent brain disorders.<br />
“Cortical interneurons are a unique cell class with rich diversity, containing numerous types with distinctive features and functional properties.” Notes Dr. Taniguchi, “This crucial funding will allow us to probe individual types of interneurons, better establishing the principles behind their wiring. Addressing this critical topic will lead to a better understanding of inhibitory circuit design and the future development of novel therapies for neuropsychiatric disorders.”</p>

<img alt="" class="attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image" height="110" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2017/08/Figure-1_Overall-winner_Podocnemis-expansa_Ana-Carolina-Lima​-140x110.jpg" style="display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;" width="140" /><p>We are delighted to announce that the 6th annual <em>BMC Ecology</em> image competition launches today! We are calling for ecologists around the world to submit their images.</p>
<p>We created the competition as a chance for ecologists to share their research and photographic skills, and celebrate the intersection of art and science.</p>
<p>The three previous competitions (the overall winners of which can be seen on this page) have certainly achieved this, providing us with superb images demonstrating the complex web of interactions that ecologists are dedicated to unraveling.</p>
<p>The winning images from previous years have attracted substantial attention not just from ecologists but also from the wider public, featuring in international media outlets such as the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/gallery/2017/aug/18/bmc-ecology-image-competition-2017-in-pictures">Guardian</a>, <a href="http://www.iflscience.com/editors-blog/awardwinning-photos-taken-during-actual-scientific-research-this-year/">IFL</a> Science, <a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/getting-big-picture-bmc-ecology-image-competition-winners/">Scientific American</a>, and <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-33718151">the BBC</a>.</p>
<p>Judging the competition will be the <a href="http://bmcecol.biomedcentral.com/about/editorial-board"><em>BMC Ecology</em> Section Editors</a>, who are experts in biodiversity, ecosystems, ecological models, and behavioral ecology. The overall winner will be chosen by a special guest judge, whose identity will be announced later in the year.</p>
<p>The overall winner will receive a cash prize of £250 (~ €300/$325), while the runner-up will receive £100 (€125/$150). Additional prizes of £50 (€65/$75) will be awarded for those images selected by the Section Editors that best represent their section.</p>

<p><i>Veteran marketing and business development executives join Science Exchange to help lead the company through its next phase of growth</i></p>
<p><b>PALO ALTO CA, June 14, 2018 –</b>(<a href="https://www.businesswire.com/" rel="nofollow">BUSINESS WIRE</a>)–Science Exchange, the<i> leading marketplace for outsourced R&amp;D<img alt="™" class="wp-smiley" src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/2.4/72x72/2122.png" style="height: 1em;" /></i>, has appointed senior team members Rob Mihalko as Vice President of Marketing and Alex Slater as Vice President of Business Development and General Manager Europe. Both executives, reporting to Science Exchange CEO Elizabeth Iorns, Ph.D., will add to an already talented management team that is driving industry-leading solutions to improve the quality and efficiency of scientific research around the world.</p>
<p>Rob Mihalko is a leading expert in business commerce and procurement and has extensive experience in successfully implementing go-to-market strategies for business-to-business marketplaces on a global scale. As VP of Marketing, Mihalko will be responsible for Science Exchange’s worldwide marketing activities. He will lead the way in aligning Science Exchange’s brand and product positioning with global marketing programs to boost awareness, sales and adoption of the company’s industry-leading R&amp;D marketplace.</p>
<p>Prior to joining Science Exchange, Mihalko was Global Vice President of Solution &amp; Customer Marketing for SAP Ariba, where he led marketing and product initiatives that transformed SAP Ariba into the world’s leading procurement and business commerce company. He also has held several senior marketing, product and finance roles with leading technology companies, including Microsoft, and was a management consultant with A.T. Kearney, advising senior executives on strategy, sourcing and supply chain transformation initiatives.</p>
<p>“I’m delighted to have joined such a passionate and mission-driven team at Science Exchange,” said Mihalko. “I’m looking forward to helping the company build on its leadership position in the outsourced research market and support its growth in new verticals and geographies.”</p>
<p>As a VP of Business Development and General Manager Europe, Alex Slater will be spearheading Science Exchange’s continued expansion into the European market. Slater brings 23 years of business development experience within contract research organizations to Science Exchange, spanning the entirety of drug discovery, from basic research to clinical development. He has also led business development teams in Europe and Asia for Covance and, most recently, was the VP Global Business Development at Eurofins Pharma Discovery Services.</p>
<p>In his new role, Slater will provide key leadership and support of Science Exchange’s business development and expansion efforts in Europe. He will work with the global business development team to stimulate provider and researcher recruitment and expand the European support team that will give researchers the personalized scientific support they expect.</p>
<p>“From my initial interactions with Elizabeth Iorns and the team at Science Exchange, I was impressed by their passion and commitment to simplifying researchers’ access to the services they need,” said Slater. “I look forward to working with such a driven team and helping expand the company’s European presence.”</p>
<p>“We work in a rapidly changing environment, and so it’s critical for us to hire people that share our ambitious vision and have the expertise to help us execute it successfully,” said Elizabeth Iorns, CEO of Science Exchange. “I’m thrilled to be welcoming our two new team members, who each bring vast experience to Science Exchange, and I look forward to working closely with them in our mission to enable scientific breakthroughs through connections.”</p>

<img alt="" class="attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image" height="110" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2018/06/smoothies-2253430_640-140x110.jpg" style="display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;" width="140" /><p>How do we make sure that nutrition labels making the 5-a-day claim aren’t being used to falsely give the impression that a product is healthy?</p>
<p>The WHO 5-a-day fruit and vegetable (FV) guidelines generally recommend consideration of fruit juice as only one FV portion regardless of quantity, for reasons based on processing and fiber breakdown.</p>
<p>If a product claims to contain two or more portions of your 5-a-day FV, this should come from more than one fruit or vegetable and it should also be ensured that that the serving size is appropriate and the amounts of saturated fat, salt and sugar are limited.</p>
<p>Although there are government schemes in place in various countries, manufacturers will sometimes make their own claims on food packaging, which are not covered by government regulations. Provided that manufacturers are following the best practice guidelines for the industry, this should mean that the product contains 80g (or more) of fruit or vegetables in one serving.</p>
<p>Food product labels which highlight the healthy component of a product can have positive impacts of healthy dietary profiles. However, if the ‘healthy component’ of a product is exaggerated, this could lead to negative effects.</p>
<p>With this in mind, researchers from Bournemouth University carried out a study, recently published in <a href="https://bmcpublichealth.biomedcentral.com/"><em>BMC Public Health</em></a>, which investigated the impact of a ‘3 of your 5-a-day’ versus a ‘1 of your 5-a-day’ smoothie product label on subsequent FV consumption. Using an acute experimental design, 194 participants (90 males, 104 females) were randomized to consume a smoothie labelled as either ‘3 of your 5-a-day’ or ‘1 of your 5-a-day’ in full, following a usual breakfast.</p>
<p>Two FV product labels were used. Each product label stated the product as a ‘smoothie’, included the smoothie flavor, and stated either ‘3 of your 5-a-day’ or ‘1 of your 5-a-day’, using the recognized national UK logo for the 5-a-day FV message. All participants were asked to look at their smoothie before consumption and were required to consume their smoothie in full, although neither the label nor the message were mentioned</p>
<p>Subsequent FV consumption was assessed using 24-h recalls.</p>
<p>The authors found that exposure to a ‘3 of your 5-a-day’ FV label following a usual breakfast resulted in reduced subsequent FV consumption compared to exposure to a ‘1 of your 5-a-day’ label. This can probably be explained by the fact that consumers felt they had achieved higher adherence to the dietary goal by consuming the product with this label and therefore allowed themselves lower adherence with subsequent FV consumption.</p>
<p>The effect viewed was largely driven by changes in consumption in usual high FV consumers, in females, and in vegetable as opposed to fruit consumption.</p>
<p>The results of this study indicate the potentials dangers of providing exaggerated information on food product labels with regards to FV provision. Greater regulation may be required to ensure accuracy in these types of messages.</p>

At the time (February 2010) I <a href="https://poynder.blogspot.com/2010/02/open-access-linked-to-alabama-shooting.html">wrote an article</a> about the incident in which I raised the issue of ownership and transparency, and quoted Peter Suber saying, “I am deeply suspicious of publishers who are unwilling to disclose their owners. We need that kind of transparency to be able to investigate whether the owners have financial interests, e.g. with pharma companies, that might compromise the integrity of their journals.” When I asked OASPA for the reason Dove had withdrawn I was told, “We had a few exchanges by email following your article and they then withdrew their membership. I asked them if they could give me a reason but they gave none.”</i></span></b></div><div class="MsoPlainText"><br /></div><div class="MsoPlainText"><b><i><span>Here it is worth noting that co-founder of OASPA Gunther Eysenbach <a href="https://oaspa.org/response-to-the-recent-article-in-science/#comment-5201">has repeatedly alleged</a> that Dove engages in “questionable publishing practices”. And at the time when OASPA terminated Dove’s membership in 2013 he referred back to the Amy Bishop paper and said that it had disappeared from its website without “any proper retraction notice/process”. (The <a href="https://www.dovepress.com/effects-of-selective-serotonin-reuptake-inhibitors-on-motor-neuron-sur-peer-reviewed-article-IJGM">paper</a> appears to have been reposted later, again with no indication of its disappearance and reappearance).

As I mentioned earlier, Dove also continue to enhance those processes. </span></div><div class="MsoPlainText"><br /></div><div class="MsoPlainText"><b><i><span>RP: While we are on the historical issues, in 2011 I was contacted by a US-based publisher who said that Dove had on two occasions launched a journal “identical or nearly identical” to this publisher’s own journals. The publisher added that only after a great deal of pressure from them did Dove change the titles of the two copycat journals. The publisher also pointed out that nine of Dove’s journals had the same EiC, many of which journals were unrelated to that EiC’s specialism.

<img alt="" class="attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image" height="110" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2018/06/sleep-140x110.jpg" style="display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;" width="140" /><p>Like good diet and exercise, sleep is a critical component to overall health. Current sleep guidelines recommend that adults between the ages of 26 and 64 sleep 7-8 hours per night and practice healthy sleep hygiene which includes limiting daytime naps to 30 minutes, avoiding stimulants such as caffeine and energy drinks before bedtime and avoiding heavy or rich foods before bedtime.</p>
<p>Previous research has shown that insufficient as well as excessive sleep are associated with health-related conditions such as hypertension, obesity, diabetes, cardiovascular events or mortality and stroke.</p>
<p>Metabolic syndrome, which is highly prevalent in Korea, is defined as a metabolic disorder consisting of at least three of the following: elevated waist circumference, high triglyceride levels, low high-density ‘good’ cholesterol levels (HDL-C), hypertension and high fasting glucose.</p>
<p>Researchers at Seoul National University College of Medicine have carried out the largest study examining a dose-response relationship between sleep duration and metabolic syndrome and its components in 133,608 Korean men and women aged 40-69 years. To do this, they used data from the HEXA study, a large-scale community-based study conducted in Korea during the years 2004-2013, which included information on socio-demographic characteristics, medical history, medication use, family history, lifestyle factors, diet, physical activity, and reproductive factors for women.</p>
<p>Sleep duration was assessed by asking the question: “In the past year, on average, how many hours/minutes of sleep (including daytime naps) did you take per day?”</p>
<p><img alt="" class="alignright wp-image-10227 size-medium" height="200" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2018/06/slimming-2728331_640-300x200.jpg" width="300" />The study, published today in <a href="https://bmcpublichealth.biomedcentral.com/"><em>BMC Public Health</em></a>, finds that compared to individuals who sleep six to seven hours per day, men who sleep fewer than six hours are more likely to have metabolic syndrome and higher waist circumference. Women who sleep fewer than six hours are more likely to have higher waist circumference. Furthermore, sleeping more than ten hours per day was associated with metabolic syndrome and increased levels of triglycerides in men, and with metabolic syndrome, higher waist circumference, higher levels of triglycerides and blood sugar, as well as low HDL-C in women.</p>
<p>The exact mechanisms for the gender differences observed are unclear but a possible explanation is that women experiencing menopausal transition face erratic fluctuations and eventual decline in estrogens as well as ovarian estradiol which may lead to frequent sleep disruptions, a common characteristic of long sleep duration. Another theory is that women may have shorter circadian periods which contributes to higher insomnia.</p>
<p><img alt="" class="size-medium wp-image-10228 alignleft" height="169" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2018/06/macaron-2462247_640-300x169.jpg" width="300" />The biological mechanisms that underlie the association between sleep duration and metabolic syndrome are also unclear but potential factors include levels of hormones which increase appetite and caloric intake or reduce energy expenditure in people who sleep less than seven hours per day, which may lead to increased waist circumference and development of obesity.</p>
<p>It’s important to note that the cross-sectional, observational nature of this study does not allow for conclusions about cause and effect. Estimates of sleep duration were based on self-report data rather than objective measures and may reflect ‘time in bed’, actual time spent asleep or time people believed they slept. Also, as the study did not distinguish between daytime naps and nighttime sleep, their impact on health could not be assessed separately.</p>
