<p>It’s well-known that physical exercise is beneficial not just to physical health but also our mental health. Yet whereas most countries have detailed, evidence-backed guidelines on the type and intensity of exercise required for various physical health benefits, such guidelines do not yet exist for exercise and mood. This is partly due to a lack of necessary evidence. However, a <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/00223980.2018.1470487">new systematic review</a> in <em>The Journal of Psychology Interdisciplinary and Applied </em>brings us usefully up-to-date on the current findings in this area, collating evidence from 38 relevant studies that examined the associations between exercise intensity, duration and modality and any effects on mood.</p>
<p><span id="more-35492"></span></p>
<p>Before dipping into some of the key take-aways, an important distinction made in the review is between aerobic exercise and anaerobic. The former involves such things as walking, jogging and cycling and means exercising in such a way that your body is able to use oxygen to burn fat for energy. In contrast, anaerobic exercise – such as lifting heavy weights or sprinting – is of such vigorous intensity that your body does not have time to use oxygen to create energy and so instead it breaks down glucose in your blood or muscles.</p>
<p>Beginning first with the influence of exercise intensity on the mood benefits of aerobic exercise, the researchers, led by John Chan at Shenzhen University, found contradictory results from 19 relevant studies. Some favoured higher intensity, others low, while seven studies found that intensity made no difference to mood benefits.</p>
<p>In relation to the intensity of anaerobic exercise, however, the results were far clearer – the optimum for improving mood is moderate intensity, perhaps because low intensity is too dull while high intensity is too unpleasant.</p>
<p>Next, Chan’s team considered exercise duration. The main finding here was that 10 minutes often appears sufficient to achieve gains in mood (although one study found that 30 minutes was required to achieve feelings of increased vigour). Overall, there was little evidence that going beyond 30 minutes leads to any further gains in mood, which is good to know for anyone who struggles to find much time for exercise in their daily schedule.</p>
<p>Finally, the researchers considered studies that have compared the mood benefits of aerobic and anaerobic exercise (they noted that mindfulness-based physical exercise, such as Yoga and Thai-Chi, have also shown promise for boosting mood, but that there is too little evidence to draw any firm conclusions). The picture here was that the beneficial mood effects of aerobic exercise are less consistent than is found with anaerobic exercise, and anaerobic exercise appears especially to be more beneficial for beating stress and anxiety (the researchers suggested this may be because with many forms of anaerobic exercise, such as weight training, it is easier to see your progress, leading to more immediate, rewarding feelings of mastery; also anaerobic exercise is associated with increases in BDNF – brain-derived neurotrophic factor – which may help foster beneficial structural and functional changes in the brain).</p>
<p>These headline results from several decades of research come with some hefty caveats. The studies were mostly lab based, used different ways of measuring intensity, and they recruited extremely varied volunteers. You can easily imagine how study findings could differ a lot depending on people’s past experience with exercise, their age and health, and even their personality and interests.</p>
<p>This makes it difficult to extrapolate from the findings to our own lives. However, when reflecting on the optimum type of exercise for your own mood, the common sense message is probably to take into consideration your own fitness level and preferences, to find that sweet spot, such that the exercise is enough of a challenge without being unpleasant.</p>
<p>Perhaps the most important lesson from this review, though, is that we clearly need much more research into how different types and intensities of exercise affect our mood in real life, and how this varies according to our own characteristics. The sophistication and ubiquity of modern fitness trackers should open up exciting new opportunities for psychology research that can address these questions.</p>

<p>Curiosity is a welcome trait in many respects and is the fuel that powers science. Yet literature is filled with fables that warn of the seductive danger of curiosity (think of how Orpheus loses his wife Eurydice forever after he succumbs to the temptation to glimpse at the underworld). In real life too, we all know the regret that can follow if we give in to curiosity – glancing at a private message that we shouldn’t have, for instance, reading a TV review when we know it contains spoilers, or trying out what happens if you put metal in a microwave (tip: don’t).</p>
<p>From whence does curiosity derive such power over us? One answer lies in the brain. In a pair of brain-imaging studies <a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2018/11/22/473975">published as a preprint at <em>bioRxiv</em></a> – aptly titled <em>Hunger For Knowledge: How The Irresistible Lure of Curiosity Is Generated In the Brain</em> – Johnny King Lau and his colleagues have shown that curiosity appears to be driven by the same neurobiological process as physical hunger.</p>
<p><span id="more-35453"></span></p>
<p>The researchers laid the groundwork for their brain-scan research with a small behavioural experiment in which hungry volunteers were shown either magic tricks or pictures of tempting food, and then presented with a lottery wheel. This wheel provided a visual presentation of the odds of a gamble (which varied from trial to trial) – if they won, they would have an increased chance at the end of the experiment to learn how the trick was done or to eat the food; if they lost, it was more likely they would suffer a mild but unpleasant electric shock at the end of the experiment. Each trial the volunteers rated their curiosity about the trick or the desirability of the food, and then chose whether to take the gamble or not.</p>
<p>The main finding here was that curiosity and hunger both swayed the volunteers’ decision-making. Above and beyond the actual odds on any trial, the volunteers were more likely to take gambles when they were more curious about the magic or more tempted by the food, even at the risk of suffering an electric shock.</p>
<p>This led Lau and his colleagues to hypothesise that curiosity fuels a physiological wanting or craving, similar to hunger. To test this, they repeated the set-up with more volunteers and this time scanned their brains too. The results showed that, whether influenced by hunger or curiosity, when their participants opted to take the gamble, activity was greater in a key region of the brain known as the striatum, which is known to be associated with motivation and reward. Moreover, when driven to make the gamble, the participants showed a greater disconnect between the striatum and the sensorimotor cortex, indicative perhaps of a discounting of the physical risks of their decision (I would add a caveat: it is always difficult to interpret the functional meaning of brain activity, especially in exploratory work of this kind, so this interpretation should probably be considered tentative).</p>
<p>Similar findings emerged from a second brain-imaging study in which curiosity was provoked by obscure, intriguing trivia quiz questions rather than by magic (a typical question was “What is the only food that never spoils?”). In this case, if the participants opted to gamble, and won, then they increased their chance of finding out the answer later. Again, opting to gamble to satisfy curiosity, or hunger, was associated with greater activity in the striatum, and a greater disconnect between striatum and sensorimotor cortex.</p>
<p>Lau’s team said their findings show that “curiosity biases our decision-making by recruiting the same incentive motivation process as extrinsic rewards (e.g. foods).” If you’re curious to find out more, <a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2018/11/22/473975">the full paper</a>, which has not yet be finalised, is currently free to view online.</p>

<div class="section" id="packaging-matlab-tool-boxes">
<h2>Packaging MATLab tool boxes</h2>
<p>The use of MATLab tool boxes is quite common in data-analysis. There's a
noticeable movement in the scientific community towards using Python, but the
work that has already been done, and the eco-systems that have developed around
MATlab will take time to migrate to a Python based eco-system.</p>
<p>A majority of the tool boxes in use are Free/Open Source, but MATLab itself is
not. As supporters of Free/Open source, we will not attempt to include MATLab
in Fedora, but the question remains on whether we provide the toolboxes.  We've
begun discussing this in the SIG, and we'll reach out to the broader Fedora
community before we decide on how to proceed.</p>
<div class="section" id="personal-views">
<h3>Personal views</h3>
<p>Personally, I'd prefer if we only provided software that support Free/Open
source eco systems. The use of proprietary software in science, while currently
necessary, should be avoided.  Yes, it may make things a little harder to start
with, but the Free/Open source tools that will be used will be accessible by
all. Overtime, just like the Free software community, the eco system will
mature.</p>
<p>A example case is the use of Microsoft products that is common in developed
countries where universities can afford their licenses. In developing
countries, this is not the case. They cannot always afford these fees. A
solution, of course, is to use <a class="reference external" href="https://www.latex-project.org">LaTeX</a> which is free for all to use, extend,
study, and share. Similarly, while universities and laboratories in developed
countries may be able to pay for MATlab licenses, this financial requirement
can hold back others---smaller labs and independent researchers.</p>
<p>If proprietary tools such as MATlab are the norm, then science is not open to
all. It should be.</p>

It's far from clear yet whether the gene-editing that He described has actually taken place - no data has yet been presented.  The very prospect of genetically-modifying human beings has, however, led to widespread c

<p><em>By guest blogger</em> <a href="http://www.jessesingal.com/">Jesse Singal</a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Replicating a study isn’t easy. Just knowing how the original was conducted isn’t enough. Just having access to a sample of experimental participants isn’t enough. As psychological researchers have known for a long time, all sorts of subtle cues can affect how individuals respond in experimental settings. A failure to replicate, then, doesn’t always mean that the effect being studied isn’t there – it can simply mean the new study was conducted a bit differently.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Many Labs 2, a project of the Center for Open Science at the University of Virginia, embarked on one of the most ambitious replication efforts in psychology yet – and did so in a way designed to address these sorts of critiques, which have in some cases hampered past efforts. The resultant paper, a preprint of which can be viewed </span><a href="https://www.psychologicalscience.org/redesign/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/ManyLabs2.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400;">here</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, is lead-authored by Richard A. Klein of the Université Grenoble Alpes. Klein and his very, very large team – it takes almost four pages of the preprint just to list all the contributors – “conducted preregistered replications of 28 classic and contemporary published findings with protocols that were peer-reviewed in advance to examine variation in effect magnitudes across sample and setting.”</span></p>
<p><span id="more-35469"></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Many Labs included 79 samples of participants tested in-person and 46 samples tested online, and of these, 39 were from the U.S. and 86 came from a variety of other countries. Among the previously published findings the researchers tried to replicate were: one in which study participants who read about structure in nature said they were more likely to pursue their goals than those who read about randomness in nature (as if exposure to structure, even if unrelated, somehow motivates us); a famous example of a “framing effect” by the behavioural-economics pioneers Amos Tversky and Danny Kahneman, in which respondents were more willing to drive further to get a discount on a cheap item than to get an equal-sized discount on an expensive item (which doesn’t make sense, “rationally” speaking, when the discounts are the same size); and another famous finding, this one from a team led by the leading social psychologist Jonathan Haidt, that showed that, among survey respondents, “Items that emphasised concerns of harm or fairness… were deemed more relevant for moral judgment by the political left than right.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Overall, 15 of the 28 attempted replications “worked,” in the sense of delivering the same finding in the same direction at a statistically significant level (p &lt; .05). When the threshold for significance was bumped up a couple orders of magnitude to p &lt; .0001 – a stricter standard some researchers have advocated as a countermeasure against </span><a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2011/12/01/questionable-research-practices-are-rife-in-psychology-survey-suggests/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">questionable research practices</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> like </span><a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2012/08/09/made-it-an-uncanny-number-of-psychology-findings-manage-to-scrape-into-statistical-significance/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">p-hacking</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> – that number dropped to 14. So in total, only about half the studies replicated, and on average, the effect sizes were significantly smaller. This is not encouraging. (The study about nature-stories and goals failed to replicate, but the Tversky/Kahneman and Haidt ones did replicate, albeit with smaller effect sizes than in the originals.)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Many Labs 2 was designed to address some of the problems, perceived and real, with previous replication efforts. After the Open Science Collaboration </span><a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2015/08/27/this-is-what-happened-when-psychologists-tried-to-replicate-100-previously-published-findings/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">published the “Reproducibility Project”</span></a>, <span style="font-weight: 400;">which was only able to successfully replicate about 40 percent of 100 then-recent papers in August 2015, for example, a team – including the famous social psychologist Dan Gilbert (a replication-crisis sceptic) and the leading quantitative social scientist Gary King – argued that there were statistical errors in that effort, and also that in some cases the replicators hadn’t followed the same procedures, or used the same sorts of samples, as the original experimenters. (The whole thing got rather tangled and included responses to responses to responses – you can read my writeup for </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">New York</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> magazine </span><a href="https://www.thecut.com/2016/03/is-psychologys-replication-crisis-really-overblown.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">here</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The question of whether replications are “close enough” to the original is especially important. When replications differ enough from the original studies, this introduces legitimate methodological concerns into the equation and gives those whose work fails to replicate an “out” – “You weren’t really replicating </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">my</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> study – you changed too much stuff.” But researchers in Many Labs 2 were more careful to follow the original studies quite closely. As a result, they argue, “variability in observed effect sizes was more attributable to the effect being studied than the sample or setting in which it was studied.” Specifically, “task order, administration in lab versus online, and exploratory WEIRD versus less WEIRD culture comparisons” – that is, whether the experiment participants were western, educated, and from industrialised rich democratic countries (a </span><a href="https://psmag.com/social-justice/joe-henrich-weird-ultimatum-game-shaking-up-psychology-economics-53135"><span style="font-weight: 400;">major concern in psych research</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, where it’s often much easier to find WEIRD study participants than non-WEIRD ones) – all failed to account for much of the differences in effect strength observed in the studies. This partially undercuts the idea that these sorts of differences might have mattered or account for failures to replicate, and it also shows that psychology can be conducted in a robust way such that the findings – whether positive or negative – are not unduly influenced by the circumstances.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Moreover, </span><a href="https://twitter.com/BrianNosek/status/1064548916862099456"><span style="font-weight: 400;">explained</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Brian Nosek, head of the Open Science Center and a coauthor on the paper, on Twitter, this time around researchers “minimised boring reasons for failure. First, using original materials &amp; </span><a href="http://cos.io/rr"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Registered Reports</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> all 28 replications met expert reviewed quality control standards. Failure to replicate not easily dismissed as replication incompetence.” He </span><a href="https://twitter.com/BrianNosek/status/1064548910872580101"><span style="font-weight: 400;">also pointed out</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that the “Replication median sample size (n = 7157) was 64x original median sample size (n = 112). If there was an effect to detect, even a much smaller one, we would detect it. Ultimate estimates have very high precision.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Of course, a single failed replication – even a big, robust one – should not cause us to confidently rule </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">out</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> an effect any more than a single positive result should cause us to believe it is definitely real. But this big, impressive effort advances the replication conversation in two important ways: It adds to the pile of evidence that there </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">is</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> a replication crisis, and it offers a useful, replicable (sorry) set of guidelines for how to conduct rigorous replications that actually measure what experts are interested in, rather than accidentally sweeping up other stuff.</span></p>

Paediatric surgeon Paolo De Coppi claims to grow all possible internal organs in his lab at UCL. Though his career started with his association with Macchiarini, and their regenerative medicine ideas sound strangely similar, De Coppi is celebrated as a modest genius poised to save lives of uncounted children, and the funding money flows.

<p>After a trauma many people have the sense it has changed them for the better, such as granting them a new appreciation for life or improving their relationships. This has given rise to the appealing notion that there is such a thing as “post-traumatic growth”. However, the majority of investigations into this phenomenon have relied on asking people whether they believe they have changed; very few have assessed people prior to a trauma and then re-assessed them afterwards to see if positive changes have actually occurred.</p>
<p>A new <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0265407518811662">study</a> in the <em>Journal of Social and Personal Relationships</em> is the first to apply this kind of “prospective design” in the context of relationship breakups in young adults, and – unfortunately for anyone who found comfort and inspiration in the principle of post-traumatic growth – the authors Meghan Owenz and Blaine Fowers say their findings are more consistent with the idea that such growth is mostly illusory, the result of a positive re-appraisal of the breakup and one’s current situation.</p>
<p><span id="more-35452"></span></p>
<p>The researchers recruited 599 undergrads currently in a romantic relationship and assessed them twice on a range of measures: at the beginning, and near the end of the semester. During that time, 100 of them lived through their relationship breaking up, an experience that, typically for their age group, they found extremely distressing (in fact, on a formal scale they rated their feelings of distress on a par with those reported by survivors of natural disasters and cardiac surgery).</p>
<p>At the start of the semester, all the participants completed a version of the commonly used “post-traumatic growth inventory” that had been slightly reworked to refer to their feelings over the last couple of weeks – such as whether they had experienced a sense of closeness with others over that time or had an appreciation for each day.</p>
<p>Near the end of the semester, all the participants re-took this same revamped version of the growth inventory, thus providing a before and after measure of their general outlook and behaviour. Importantly, the 100 students who’d been through a breakup also took the classic version of the inventory, rating how much they felt they had changed for the better in the same domains (such as closeness to others and life appreciation, among others) but specifically as a result of their relationship trauma.</p>
<p>Comparing early- and late-semester scores on the revamped growth inventory, there was no evidence for positive change, and no evidence that the students who’d been through a break-up showed any more improvement than the students who had not. In contrast, the break-up students did report feeling that the trauma had changed them for the better. Moreover, this perception of growth was higher for students who previously described themselves as more optimistic and who found their breakup more distressing.</p>
<p>Owenz and Fowers believe these findings are consistent with the idea that the perception of growth after trauma is illusory, arising from a (positive) re-appraisal of the situation. Colloquially we might invoke Freud and call this a defence mechanism – looking on the bright side as a way to cope (something that the more optimistic students, and more distressed students, were more inclined to do). More generally, the researchers acknowledge that <em>actual</em> positive growth may be a reality for some people, but they think it unlikely for most.</p>
<p>Future research might paint a different picture. The current findings pertain to young people in a specific culture going through a specific kind of trauma, and they were tested over a relatively short time frame. For now, though, these authors and others believe the burden is on advocates of the existence of post-traumatic growth to provide more robust evidence for their claims, especially using study designs that do not rely purely on people’s subjective and retrospective reports of change. The current situation – where post-traumatic growth is considered a reality based on limited research – Owenz and Fowers find  “…particularly worrisome, given the rapid move from research ‘documenting’ post-traumatic growth to interventions and self-help books designed to promote an approach to trauma that remains questionable.”</p>

<img alt="" class="attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image" height="110" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2018/11/SPL_11691261_HiRes-1-140x110.jpg" style="display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;" width="140" /><p>Cancer of the pancreas continues to be an active area of research. It is a common cancer all over the world and continues to be one of the most lethal. About 99% of patients with cancer of the pancreas have adenocarcinoma, a type of malignant tumor, and the 5-year survival rate for patients with adenocarcinoma of the pancreas is about 3-5%.</p>
<p>The survival rate has improved somewhat in recent years because of developments in surgery and surgical critical care, resulting in better results after resection. However, despite aggressive surgical resection, 95-97% of these patients still die within 5 years. One of the problems is that there are no adjuvant treatments (therapy applied after surgery) which are routinely effective. Surgery is most effective in patients with early stage disease but approximately 90% of patients with the disease already have metastases at the time of diagnosis and surgery will not benefit them.</p>
<p>There are many investigators studying the characteristics and growth of pancreatic cancer at the cellular and sub-cellular levels. This approach may eventually result in the development of effective therapies, although this may take a long time. It is hoped, for example that immunotherapies could be developed to attack specific, but as yet unidentified, markers on the cell surface of pancreas cancer cells. Understanding malignancies at the cellular and sub-cellular level is essential for the development of effective therapies.</p>
<h3><strong>Complementing cellular research with computer models</strong></h3>
<blockquote><p>The computer models we are developing may assist in identifying the best time to administer a yet to be developed agent that is effective against pancreas cancer.</p></blockquote>
<p>Another approach is the one we are taking, to study the growth of the entire tumor in the patient, using data from computed tomography imaging. We are obtaining this data and fitting it to innovative models of cancer growth. This approach is complementary to cellular research to develop an effective adjuvant therapy for this disease.</p>
<p>The computer models we are developing may assist in identifying the best time to administer a yet to be developed agent that is effective against pancreas cancer. Our expectation is that we can use a computer model to understand the growth of the entire tumor based on data from other patients. Ultimately this approach may contribute to the effectiveness of future agents against pancreatic cancer.</p>
<p>The approach we are taking to treating pancreatic cancer should also help to improve awareness and understanding of this disease. We are using computer models, which is a new approach to cancer therapy. One aspect of this approach is that people will be able to understand exactly where their own tumors fit into the pattern of data from many other patients. This results in a form of “personalized therapy” where the timing of administration of the anticancer agent would depend on the growth pattern of the patient’s individual tumor growth pattern.</p>
<p>There is little question that the current outlook for therapy given to patients with cancer of the pancreas is bleak. The only curative treatment is surgery but only 10% of patients with the disease are even eligible for surgery. We must continue to develop new approaches to therapy. The research we are doing may help to guide optimal administration of these new treatments, with a personalized approach based on the growth characteristics of a patient’s own unique tumor.</p>

<p>It feels selfish to fret – it’s the other person who is suffering – but agonising over what to say to a friend in need can be incredibly anxiety provoking. If you want to be supportive (and not make matters worse), what are the right words to say to someone who has experienced a relationship break-up, for instance, or lost their job? Should you express sympathy, downplay the situation, say you know how they feel, or something else entirely? A series of studies <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/01973533.2018.1509341">in <em>Basic and Applied Social Psychology</em></a> will offer relief to anyone who has ever agonised over this predicament – the findings suggest that in fact there are few, if any, “magic statements that, if spoken, would provide lasting comfort to the recipient.”</p>
<p>Shawna Tanner at Wayne State University and her colleagues propose that in all likelihood trying too hard to say the right thing could actually lead you to make “clumsy statements that do more harm than good”. They advise that as long as your friend or relative sees you as supportive, then your “mere presence and sympathy is likely enough”.</p>
<p><span id="more-35430"></span></p>
<p>Tanner’s team first re-analysed data published in 2008 that involved nearly 300 schoolchildren (aged 10 to 15) rating the supportiveness of six statements. These were ostensibly made by one friend to another, who had either had an academic set-back or been rejected from a group picnic. The six statements represented different supportive strategies such as offering sympathy, being optimistic or minimising the seriousness of the situation. There was barely any agreement between the children in their ratings of the supportiveness of the statements. A more important factor was the children’s own tendencies – some of them, more than others, were inclined to see the statements as generally more supportive. Comfort, then, is in the ears of the listener, not the words themselves.</p>
<p>A new study backed this up. The researchers asked 54 undergrads to rate the supportiveness of 96 statements across eight hypothetical situations, deliberately composed to appeal to people with certain personality traits – for example, there were positive-thinking type statements designed to appeal to optimists (e.g. “things have a funny way of working out for the best”) and community-minded statements designed to appeal to people with a sociable, collegiate disposition (e.g. “Well, your friends like you better anyway and now you can spend more time with us”). Once again, there was very little agreement between the students in which statements were considered the more supportive, and this was the case even when restricting the analysis to sub-groups of the students with similar personality traits. Instead, more relevant were participants’ own idiosyncrasies – how they happened to like some supportive statements but not others.</p>
<p>Finally, in an effort to increase the realism of their investigation, the researchers asked 33 clinical psychologists, undergrad and graduate clinical trainees to rate the supportiveness of statements made by therapists in therapy training videos. Once more there was little agreement about which statements were the more supportive, even among the sub-groups (for instance, among the qualified clinical psychologists specifically).</p>
<p>The background to these new findings is that past research has shown there is also little agreement between people about the trait supportiveness, or not, of other individuals. Tanner’s team reasoned that this subjectivity need not necessarily apply to supportive utterances, but it seems it does. There is not something about certain people, nor certain carefully chosen words, that makes them universally comforting. Rather – and likely for highly complex reasons – we each have an idiosyncratic take on who is supportive and which words we find most helpful. While further research is needed to confirm this take – including studies in more realistic situations and involving people from varied cultures – for now this message should bring reassurance to anyone who has worried about saying the right thing to a friend or relative in need.</p>

<p>The brightest STEM high school students can now work side-by-side with preeminent scientists at one of the world’s leading neuroscience research institutions. The Florida Atlantic University Max Planck Academy on the John D. MacArthur Campus in Jupiter stands to redefine approaches to STEM (science-technology-engineering and math) education, not just in South Florida, but nationwide.</p>
<p>“Based on historical educational reform efforts, the FAU Max Planck Academy will be the most consequential shift in the delivery of education in the United States in decades,” said Joel Herbst, Ed.D., superintendent of FAU PK-12 schools and educational programs. “This is a significant pivot from the traditional model of delivering education. We are offering exceptional high school students an extraordinary opportunity to work alongside renowned scientists. As the only program of its kind in the world, the Academy will serve as the new model for STEM education delivery.”</p>
<p>The FAU Max Planck Academy is the latest partnership between FAU, the Max Planck Florida Institute for Neuroscience (MPFI) and the Germany-based Max Planck Society, expanding on similar opportunities for FAU’s <span><a href="http://www.fau.edu/newsdesk/articles/BratiDas-IBAN.php">graduate</a></span> and <span><a href="https://www.fau.edu/newsdesk/articles/fau-max-planck-society-undergraduate-honors-program.php">undergraduate students</a></span>. This unprecedented program will open the laboratories of Max Planck to high school students, allowing them to participate in world-class research and scientific discoveries as part of their curriculum.  Six high-achieving FAU High students currently are dual-enrolled in an Academy pilot program, directly learning from scientists – including Nobel Laureates – and spending time in MPFI labs.  The students were selected based on the following criteria: National Merit Scholars, strong academic achievement as measured by a high grade point average and an expressed interest in data science.</p>
<p>The Academy will be organized as a standalone extension of FAU High School – a nationally recognized, public “Blue Ribbon School” located on FAU’s Boca Raton campus that offers an accelerated pre-collegiate program where students work toward a cost-free bachelor’s degree and high school diploma simultaneously. The Academy in Jupiter will offer a unique and individualized program for students, starting in their junior year of high school. Enriched, honors academic pathways in STEM will be pursued, including neuroscience, biological sciences, chemistry, engineering and computer science. These students will ultimately gain priority admission into the undergraduate Max Planck Honors program which was launched last spring.</p>
<p>FAU Max Planck Academy students will assist MPFI researchers in a number of ways, such as engaging in laboratory research, organizing and analyzing big data using machine learning and other advanced computational techniques, or assisting in MPFI’s state-of-the-art Scientific Core facilities, such as electron microscopy, molecular biology, and the Imaging Center. Benefiting from the international presence of MPFI and the Max Planck Society, the Academy experience will lead to extraordinary international networking, mentorship, and study abroad opportunities.</p>
<p>“The Max Planck Society has a long history of investing in the education of the next generation of scientists. Our ideal has always to been to provide the most promising minds with state-of-the-art resources and opportunities. We have proudly educated thousands of junior scientists at the college, Ph.D. and postdoctoral level, and are now excited to extend the Max Planck model of scientific excellence to the high-school level,” said David Fitzpatrick, Ph.D., CEO and scientific director of MPFI.</p>
<p>Four years ago, FAU President John Kelly explored expanding the FAU High program to offer targeted educational tracks for specific disciplines.</p>
<p>“We explored how we could scale and replicate FAU High, as well as build specific pipelines to various disciplines for our best students,” said Kelly. “Just a few years later, FAU High has gone from 78 students to 570. We’ve since launched the <span><a href="https://www.fau.edu/newsdesk/articles/fau-launches-first-md-pipeline-program.php">M.D. Direct pipeline</a></span>, securing seats in our Schmidt College of Medicine for high school students interested in becoming physicians, and now we’re launching the FAU Max Planck Academy for the brightest STEM students. This new program could not have happened without the hard work of our superintendent Joel Herbst and his team, and a shared vision with the leadership at Max Planck.”</p>
<p>Approximately 35-50 students will be admitted in the inaugural class, eventually scaling up to about 50 students. Beginning in 2019, the highly selective application process will target National Merit semifinalists, as well as the best STEM students from around the world. The first class is slated to begin in fall 2020 and to graduate in spring 2022. Students who successfully complete this exceptional program will earn a high school diploma embossed with both the FAU and Max Planck seals, and at least two years of accelerated college credit – tuition free – leading to elite research experiences and distinction through the FAU Max Planck Honors program and accelerated bachelor’s degree at FAU.</p>
<p>“This new STEM education model can be replicated with other elite research organizations to help them find new talent, which is needed as many studies point to a looming shortfall in STEM degrees verses STEM workforce needs,” said Herbst. “We believe the best evidence-based strategy to help combat the STEM employment gap is the early college, high school approach.”</p>

<p>A new survey of beliefs held by social psychologists (335 mostly US-based members of the Society of Experimental Social Psychology) has confirmed previous reports that the field is overwhelmingly populated by researchers of a left-wing, liberal bent. What’s more, David Buss and William von Hippel – the evolutionary social psychologists who conducted and analysed the survey – say their findings, <a href="http://psycnet.apa.org/record/2018-57934-001">published open-access in <em>Archives of Scientific Psychology</em></a>, suggest that some social psychologists may be opposed, for ideological reasons, to insights rooted in evolutionary psychology.</p>
<p>Buss and von Hippel add that compounding matters is an irony – the desire of some researchers to signal their ideological stance and commitment to others who share their political views, which is a manifestation of the evolved human adaptation to form coalitions. “Part of this virtue signalling entails rejecting a caricature of evolutionary psychology that no scientist actually holds,” they write.</p>
<p><span id="more-35417"></span></p>
<p>In terms of the political bias among social psychologists, Buss and von Hippel found that 95 per cent were mostly liberal and left-wing in their views (also, among the US respondents, only 4 had voted Republican in the prior Presidential election while 305 had voted Democrat).</p>
<p>Quizzing the social psychologists on their views of evolutionary theory, Buss and von Hippel found that they overwhelmingly accepted the principles of Darwinian evolution and also that it applied to humans, but when it came to whether evolutionary theory applies to human psychology and behaviour, the sample was split, with many social psychologists rejecting this notion.</p>
<p>Digging deeper into the survey results, there was no evidence that the social psychologists were averse to evolutionary psychology for religious reasons, but many did reject the idea that humans might be inherently violent (in certain situations) or that some people are widely considered more physically attractive than others due to universal evolved standards of attractiveness – perhaps, Buss and von Hippel suggested, this is because “they dislike the implications regarding <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2018/10/12/what-are-we-like-10-psychology-findings-that-reveal-the-worst-of-human-nature/">the dark side of human nature</a>.”</p>
<p>Next, Buss and von Hippel asked the social psychologists about their views on the truth of five hot button statements related to the biological basis of average sex differences, such as whether such differences are primarily genetic rather than environmental, whether sex-differentiated hormones play a role, and whether it might be more difficult for men than women to stay faithful in long-term romantic relationships.</p>
<p>Answers to three of these five hot-button questions accounted for a small but statistically significant amount of the variance in the social psychologists’ position on whether evolutionary theory applies to human psychology and their self-reported political ideology. This pattern is consistent with the idea that, while the relation between political ideology and scientific beliefs is complex, some social psychologists are inclined to reject evolutionary psychology findings on ideological grounds (in keeping with this interpretation, a substantial portion of the sample said it would be bad if the hot-button findings were widely reported).</p>
<p>As a case in point, Buss and von Hippel highlight the recent book <em>Testosterone Rex:</em> <em>Unmaking the Myths of Our Gendered Minds</em> by psychologist Cordelia Fine – a text that argues against biological differences between the sexes (and in favour of sociological explanations) and which won wide <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/jan/18/testosterone-rex-review-cordelia-fine">praise from journalists</a> and <a href="https://royalsociety.org/news/2017/09/cordelia-fine-wins-30th-anniversary-royal-society-insight-investment-science-book-prize/">left-leaning scientists</a> around the globe, while at the same time receiving scathing criticism from <a href="https://whyevolutionistrue.wordpress.com/2017/09/28/a-new-critique-of-cordelia-fines-testosterone-rex/">evolutionary biologists</a> and <a href="https://quillette.com/2017/03/21/cordelia-fines-testosterone-rex-a-review/">psychologists</a> with relevant expertise in evolutionary science.</p>
<p>Buss and von Hippel argue that Fine and others are motivated by social justice goals (in this case gender equality) to reject findings from evolutionary biology and psychology – or a caricature of them. But they believe this is a mistake, not only for the obvious reason that it is wrong to misrepresent the evidence, but also because important moral principles – such as equality – should not be founded on the the idea that there are no biological differences between women and men. Here they quote the author and evolutionary psychologist Steven Pinker, who argued, “… equality is not the empirical claim that all groups of humans are interchangeable; it is the moral principle that individuals should not be judged or constrained by the average properties of their group.”</p>
<p>Buss and von Hippel think that, motivated by principles of social justice, many social psychologists are ideologically opposed to what they mistakenly think evolutionary psychology argues for – namely genetic determinism, environmental irrelevance, and the idea that attempts to change human behaviour are doomed to fail. In fact, these are erroneous caricatures and evolutionary psychology does not espouse any of these beliefs. It does though recognise that we are not blank slates and that our minds and behaviour have been shaped by evolution in important ways.</p>
<p>Critically, Buss and von Hippel make the point that recognising our evolved psychological adaptations and predilections will actually lead to more effective efforts toward social justice (on the other hand, denying the biological roots of human nature will surely blind researchers from understanding some of the important factors at play in the social injustices that they seek to address). The pair add that, ironically, it is the evolved human tendency to form coalitions that leads “…social scientists to signal ideological commitments to their presumptive coalitions rather than to ferret out the most compelling scientific theories and empirical findings.”</p>
<p>On an optimistic note, Buss and von Hippel point out that their survey found that a substantial minority of social psychologists <em>did</em> endorse findings rooted in evolutionary biology. But still there is a long way to go until the schism in psychological and theoretical perspectives is bridged – a situation they believe is likely made worse by the lack of proper training in evolutionary sciences in psychology*. “Not a single degree-granting institution in the United States, to our knowledge, requires even a single course in evolutionary biology as part of a degree in psychology,” they write, adding that this is “an astonishing educational gap that disconnects psychology from the rest of the life sciences.”</p>

<h4>When cortex is useless, what do we learn?</h4><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/938/1*DbFF6adUhl5a8u_yOaec5g.png" />Chameleon Designs / Noun Project</figure><p>The cortex, that many layered cake of neurons, occupies a special place in neuroscience. Our best guess at the root of our prodigious intellectual abilities — of language, of sculpture, of base-jumping in a kilt — is that our cortex is far more dense with neurons than any other species. Our dominant sense, sight, commands a third or more of the entire cortex. And its exquisite circuitry hints at devilishly complex computations, of probabilities, of inference, of algorithms that AIs can only dream of. If we want to understand the brain from a human perspective, the cortex is where we must start.</p><p>(The fact that it is also by far the easiest part of the brain to record from in both animals and humans, as it’s right at the top, is <strong>entirely coincidental</strong>, and shall not detain us further here.)</p><p>So it’s a right bugger when it turns out cortex is essentially useless. <br /><a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-018-0527-y">Writing in <em>Nature</em></a>, Kate Hong and colleagues in Randy Bruno’s lab have reported just that: a mouse can happily use a single whisker to solve a problem even when the special bit of cortex representing that specific whisker is missing. Worse, the mouse can even learn to solve the problem from scratch, without apparently noticing it has a hole in its cortex where lots of important stuff should be happening.</p><p>Is cortex then just a blanket to keep the rest of the brain warm? (Peter Redgrave, on innumerable occasions). No, but damn we have to be careful about what we claim cortex is necessary for.</p><p>Hong and friends set out to answer a different question: what is the difference between temporarily and permanently turning off a bit of cortex? If you want to do such complex monkeying around with a bit of cortex, then you need a simple behaviour to study, and you need to be able to turn off a bit of cortex that should be involved in that behaviour.</p><p>Now you may know that mice have whiskers. The nice thing about whiskers is that each big whisker has a set of dedicated neurons in cortex, which tend to be active only when that big whisker is tweaked, dabbed, or smacks into something. And it is (relatively) easy to find those neurons, because you can tweak the whisker and find which bit of cortex lights up. The bit of cortex representing one big whisker is then a juicy target for turning it off to see what happens.</p><p>So Hong and friends set their mice the task of detecting a pole with one big whisker. On each trial, the mouse held down a lever to say it was ready to take the test. Then either the pole swung within range of their big whisker, or it swung the other way, out of reach. When the pole was in range, it meant reward was available. If the pole was out range it meant there was no reward available right now, and the mouse had to keep holding down the lever until the pole reset — then it could let go and, in its own time, start again.</p><p>The mouse’s test was thus to swish its whisker and see if it hit the pole. A hit should mean to the mouse “aha! I can go and get a reward”; a miss should mean “aha! There is no reward; I’ll wait right here and keep pressing down this lever for some arbitrary reason known only to those dorks over there in white coats”.</p><p>Mice had to learn all this by trial and error — pressing a lever, swishing the whisker, hitting a pole (or not), and letting go of the lever (or not). They learn this quickly. Quicker than some of us, I’d wager.</p><p>Once the mice had learnt, Hong and friends permanently turned off the big whisker’s cortical neurons by removing them. And lo, performance immediately went to pot. The mice made the wrong decisions about whether the pole was hit or not, and got far fewer rewards as a result.</p><p>Nothing unexpected there. Monkey around in cortex and it makes a mess of performance, big whoop. But now the kicker: the terrible performance was on the first day after removing the neurons. On the second day after removal, the mice recovered completely. They performed just as well as they’d done before anyone monkeyed around with their cortex. And carried on doing so for all the following days.</p><p>Which led Hong and colleagues to the crucial question: er, if mice can apparently re-learn the task in a matter of a day, did they need this bit of cortex to learn in the first place?</p><p>No, they didn’t. Removing the big whisker’s neurons from cortex before any training had no effect on learning at all. Mice learnt equally fast and equally well with or without that bit of cortex. Sheesh.</p><p>The result of this study may seem simple, but it has many ramifications. There are lessons here for any serious student of how brains work.</p><p>Lesson one is that establishing causality is a pain. You’d think that turning off a part of the brain and seeing that a behaviour breaks would be big kahuna levels of evidence that the brain part in question causes that behaviour. But no. Here Hong and co have shown us, again, that turning off some brain bit does not establish causality.</p><p>To reinforce how misleading this turning off can be, in a separate set of experiments Hong used the terrific toolbox of modern neuroscience to temporarily turn off the cortical neurons representing that big whisker, but only on some, randomly chosen, trials (AKA they expressed a light-sensitive opsin in the pyramidal cells of barrel C2, which suppressed spiking in those neurons when activated with a light). And performance went to pot on just the trials when the neurons were turned off, remaining just fine on the rest of the trials. Read uncritically, this would imply that the big whisker neurons were essential for doing the task — after all, whenever you turn them off, performance tanks. But we know this is not true: the same bit of cortex could be turned off completely, and yet the mice still could do the task.</p><p>Lesson two is that establishing causality is a <strong>pain</strong>. Even when the big whisker’s neurons were turned off or removed, the dip in performance was not back to random guessing. The mice still did better than chance, so something else in the brain was still able to cope with the task a bit. Indeed when Hong and co temporarily removed the big whisker itself, then the performance of the mice collapsed completely, and they did no better than guessing randomly where the pole was. Which, of course, is what they were doing.</p><p>Lesson three is that establishing causality is a PAIN. Notice that removing the big whisker neurons immediately impaired the mice who had already learnt the task. But removing the big whisker neurons before learning did not have any effect on learning itself. Just because a brain region seems to be involved in performing a task does not mean it is critical to learn that task. And vice versa: a brain region may be necessary to learn it, but not do it.</p><p>Lesson four is that ESTABLISHING CAUSALITY IS A PAIN. As previously noted <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nature16442">by Otchy and co</a>, when performance tanks because you’ve shut down a bit of brain, but recovers quickly, then it actually establishes the opposite of what you wanted to do. It means that turning of that bit of cortex interfered with the normal function of a different bit of the brain — the bit that could do the task perfectly well without cortex. So all you’ve shown is that the bit of cortex you turned off is annoying a different part of the brain. And when you shut off the normal signals from that bit of cortex, it throws another bit of brain out of whack.</p><p>Our final lesson is the deepest: degeneracy. Or, the brain has multiple solutions to the same problem. Signals from the whisker go to many places in the brain, not just cortex. They go to various bits of thalamus and brainstem, that then send the signals on to other complex bits of brain that aren’t cortex (like striatum or the superior colliculus). Hong and co’s data tells us that a task as simple as “is the pole there or not” doesn’t need the big whisker signals to be routed to the big whisker parts of cortex — there are other bits of brain that are equally capable of solving the problem.</p><p>It seems we’ve learnt a simple rule about the mouse brain: if cortex is there, use that; if not, something else can cope. The question is, how complex does a task have to be before only cortex can cope? The answer is almost certainly Jean-Pipsqueak Sartre’s hell: dealing with other mice.</p><p><em>Want more?

<p>For people diagnosed with what’s known as “treatment-resistant major depressive disorder” the prognosis is not good – the low mood and emotional pain for these individuals has not lifted even though they are on a combination of antidepressant medications and may also have participated in psychotherapy. However a glimmer of hope comes via a research group in Portugal who reported recently <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S002239561830164X#mmc1">in the <em>Journal of Psychiatric Research</em></a> that adopting a pet “enhanced” the effects of anti-depressant medication for a significant minority of their participants with previously treatment-resistant depression.</p>
<p><span id="more-35366"></span></p>
<p><span class="content"><span class="text given-name">Jorge </span><span class="text surname">Mota Pereira and </span></span><span class="content"><span class="text given-name">Daniela </span><span class="text surname">Fonte at the Clínica Médico-Psiquiátrica da Ordem in Porto recruited 80 outpatients with severe treatment-resistant depression and invited them to adopt a pet as part of a study into the effects of pet adoption on depression. Thirty-three of them agreed to do so (20 adopted a dog or dogs, 7 a cat); another 33 who declined were allocated to form a control group. </span></span></p>
<p><span class="content"><span class="text surname">All the participants were assessed for their depression symptoms and general functioning at baseline and then again at 4, 8 and 12-week follow-up. Thirty individuals in each group successfully attended all the required assessments. </span></span></p>
<p>The main finding is that by the end of the study (at the 12-week assessment), just over a third of the pet-adoption group had remitted – that is, their scores on the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale and the Global Assessment of Functioning Scale had reduced to the point that their problems were now considered only mild. By contrast, none of the control group had entered remission or in fact showed any signs of change in their symptoms at all. These improvements in the pet group actually began manifesting by week 4 follow-up, suggesting the apparent benefits of pet ownership were rapid.</p>
<p>Pereira and Fonte said that looking after a pet involves “a strong affinity and companionship that strongly contributes to mental health” and that their results show that people with treatment-resistant depression “that are willing to have a pet should be encouraged to do so”.</p>
<p>A major weakness of the study is that it depended on participants volunteering to adopt a pet (rather than on random allocation to the pet adoption condition) – so, although pet-adopters and the controls were matched for baseline depression symptoms, there may have been other ways that they differed. For instance, perhaps there was something different about the personalities or social circumstances of the pet adopters that contributed to their willingness to adopt a pet and to their higher remission rates (raising the possibility that the pet adoption itself was not the main “active ingredient” in their recovery).

                <h4><a href="https://poynder.blogspot.com/2018/11/the-oa-interviews-frances-pinter.html">The OA Interviews: Frances Pinter</a></h4>

<div class="MsoNormal">In 2012 serial entrepreneur <span class="MsoHyperlink"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frances_Pinter">Frances Pinter</a></span> founded a new company called Knowledge Unlatched (<span class="MsoHyperlink"><a href="http://www.knowledgeunlatched.org/">KU</a></span>). The goal, she <span class="MsoHyperlink"><a href="http://www.knowledgeunlatched.org/2013/01/an-interview-with-frances-pinter/">explained</a></span> in 2013, was to “change the way we fund the publishing of quality content” for book-length publications, and in a way that would allow them to be made open access. </div><div class="MsoNormal"></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-4vy_LNeyZxU/W_pLzl39-QI/AAAAAAAAiDM/_wUrVuaKTjgkvdG_8Uq5LPHF4Po5sQM6gCLcBGAs/s1600/steamer-trunk-3414018_640.jpg" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" data-original-height="428" data-original-width="640" height="133" src="https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-4vy_LNeyZxU/W_pLzl39-QI/AAAAAAAAiDM/_wUrVuaKTjgkvdG_8Uq5LPHF4Po5sQM6gCLcBGAs/s200/steamer-trunk-3414018_640.jpg" width="200" /></a></div><br /><div class="MsoNormal">With that end in mind, Pinter launched a pilot project in which research libraries were invited to pool money to fund the “fixed costs” of publishing monographs. By doing so, Pinter reasoned, PDF and HTML versions of these “unlatched” books could be made freely available on the Web, but print and other premium versions would continue to be sold in the traditional manner. And those libraries that contributed to the pool would earn the right to buy the premium versions at a discounted price. </div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal">In a spirit of civic-mindedness Pinter created Knowledge Unlatched as a UK non-profit Community Interest Company (<span class="MsoHyperlink"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Community_interest_company">CIC</a></span>). And with Pinter’s formidable reputation as a publisher, KU quickly acquired mindshare and influence, and went on to play an important role in the thinking about the scope and opportunities for OA monographs, as well as in policy development – both in the UK and globally. </div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal">Above all, says Pinter below, KU went on to provide proof of concept for a new way of funding OA monographs, and perhaps of funding OA more generally. </div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><h3><span style="font-size: large;">Sustainability</span></h3><h2></h2><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span class="MsoHyperlink"><a href="https://www.thebookseller.com/news/knowledge-unlatched-moves-second-phase-314212">Initial funding</a></span> for KU came from (amongst others) the <span class="MsoHyperlink"><a href="https://www.bl.uk/aboutus/stratpolprog/trust/">British Library Trust</a></span>, <span class="MsoHyperlink"><a href="https://www.opensocietyfoundations.org/">Open Society Foundations</a></span>, <span class="MsoHyperlink"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Higher_Education_Funding_Council_for_England">HEFCE</a></span>, as well as a number of Australian libraries. </div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal">When that funding ended, however, as a non-profit CIC, KU struggled to raise further funds or capital. And with few assets to offer as collateral, commercial loans were equally hard to come by. Consequently, it was not immediately clear how KU could become financially sustainable, or even whether it could. Faced with this truth, says Pinter, she was minded to call it day.</div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal">Supporters, however, were urging her to continue and so Pinter drew down a six-figure sum from her pension savings and, with some additional funding from Australia’s Curtin University, she proceeded to a second pilot round. This saw increased support from publishers and a larger number of books offered for unlatching. But while this was encouraging, the sustainability issue had not gone away.</div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">At this point, Pinter was approached by former <a href="https://www.degruyter.com/">De Gruyter</a> CEO <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/svenfund/">Sven Fund</a> and invited to sell some of KU’s assets. She agreed, and Fund acquired the bulk of KU.</div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal">As a result, KU was transformed from a UK non-profit CIC to a for-profit GmbH based in Berlin, and KU is now owned by another Sven Fund for-profit company called <span class="MsoHyperlink"><a href="http://fullstopp.com/">fullstopp</a></span>. </div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal">After acquiring KU, Sven Fund moved quickly to develop and launch a raft of new products and initiatives, including a <span class="MsoHyperlink"><a href="http://www.knowledgeunlatched.org/ku-journals/">journal collection</a></span>, <span class="MsoHyperlink"><a href="http://knowledgeunlatched.org/ku-partners/">KU Partners,</a></span> <span class="MsoHyperlink"><a href="http://www.knowledgeunlatched.org/ku-select-library-info/">KU Select</a></span> and <span class="MsoHyperlink"><a href="http://www.knowledgeunlatched.org/book-processing-charge-calculator/">KU Open Funding</a></span>. The latter is a platform designed to act as a broker between research institutions, publishers, and authors who want to make their monographs OA.</div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><h3><span style="font-size: large;">Criticism</span></h3><h2></h2><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal">However, KU’s change of status and its more aggressive stance in the marketplace has attracted criticism from the research community. This came to a head last month when former KU employee Marcel Knöchelmann published a <span class="MsoHyperlink"><a href="http://blogs.lse.ac.uk/impactofsocialsciences/2018/10/03/knowledge-unlatched-failed-transparency-and-the-commercialisation-of-open-access-book-publishing/">post</a></span> on the <span class="MsoHyperlink"><a href="http://blogs.lse.ac.uk/impactofsocialsciences/2017/08/15/scholarly-communications-shouldnt-just-be-open-but-non-profit-too/">LSE Impact Blog</a></span> in which he complained that KU had undergone a process of silent commercialisation. He also suggested that the decision by UK funder <span class="MsoHyperlink"><a href="https://re.ukri.org/">Research England</a></span> to <span class="MsoHyperlink"><a href="https://re.ukri.org/blog/helen-snaith/open-access-and-monographs/">contract</a></span> KU parent fullstopp to undertake a survey of the OA monograph landscape raised conflict of interest issues. </div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal">The problem, he said, is that “The parent company of the commercial entity which stands to profit from a future of open access book publishing is advising on what the future of open access book publishing in the UK should be”. </div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal">In a separate <span class="MsoHyperlink"><a href="https://blogs.openbookpublishers.com/why-obp-is-not-participating-in-ku-open-funding-and-why-libraries-should-understand-the-reasons/">post</a></span> two days later the Director of Open Book Publishers <span class="MsoHyperlink"><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/rupert-gatti-113b3620/?originalSubdomain=uk">Rupert Gatti</a></span> complained that KU was insisting that those publishers who use the KU Open Funding platform must sign an exclusive contract. </div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal">As a result, said Gatti, OBP would not be participating in KU Open Funding. “These types of exclusivity contracts can be used by digital ‘platforms’ as a strategy to monopolise and dominate an industry.”</div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal">Other OA monograph publishers have indicated that they too plan to boycott the KU Open Funding platform, including members of the <span class="MsoHyperlink"><a href="https://scholarled.org/">ScholarLed</a></span> consortium of academic-led, not-for-profit, open access book publishers.  </div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal">In response, KU has agreed to cease insisting on exclusive contracts and Research England and fullstopp have said that both the survey questions and (some of ) the responses fullstopp receives to that survey will be made publicly available (more from Research England <a href="https://plus.google.com/+RichardPoynder/posts/Ek8Wg2oQiLz">here</a>). </div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal">Nevertheless, it is not clear that critics are yet convinced that KU’s business model is the right one. Nor have they come to terms with its new for-profit status. “I feel crowdfunding from libraries to unlock back- and front-list titles merely funnels more money to conventional academic publishers, who don’t have to change their broken business models at all,”<span class="MsoHyperlink"> <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/eileen-joy-b6a06a5/">Eileen Joy</a></span> of non-profit <span class="MsoHyperlink"><a href="https://punctumbooks.com/">punctum books</a></span> told me on Twitter. “In other words, it’s not a transformative approach to OA and it keeps broken systems in place.”</div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal">She added, “We don’t want to see too many for-profit ‘middlemen’ between publishers and librarians. We want to build partnerships with libraries (and have already done that; e.g. punctum just inaugurated a two-year pilot partnership with UCSB Library at UC Santa Barbara).”</div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal">Eileen Joy concludes: “We are also troubled by the transfer of KU from a non-profit directed by Frances Pinter to a for-profit directed by Sven Fund in Berlin. Does anyone know anything about the details of that transaction / hand-over? Did Sven Fund buy KU from Pinter and for how much? What is her role now? Isn’t Fund a venture capitalist? Does he really have a commitment to the long-term health of a more equitable ecosystem for OA and scholarly communications or is KU a business venture for him?”</div><div class="MsoNormal"></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br />Hopefully, the interview below with Pinter (and what I have said above) will go some way to answering these questions.</div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /><a name="more"></a></div><h3><span style="font-size: large;">Logical and inevitable?</span></h3><h2></h2><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal">We should also note that some view KU’s transformation as both logical and inevitable. “I’m not terribly surprised to see KU shifting to a more – shall we say – corporate model,” says <span class="MsoHyperlink"><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/rick-anderson-1475689/">Rick Anderson</a></span>, Associate Dean for Collections &amp; Scholarly Communication at the University of Utah’s J. Willard Marriott Library. “I think it had two choices: either continue trying to do something that its marketplace can’t really support (and do it at a loss) or shift to a mode that recognises market realities but upsets the ‘free everything all the time’ ideologues. Unsurprisingly, KU seems to have chosen the sustainable path rather than the politically correct one.”</div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal">Anderson adds, “Now, is the sustainable path they’ve chosen the right one? I don’t know. But I will say this: pearl-clutching reactions to the ‘commercialisation’ of OA book publishing are disingenuous at best. If the OA community objected to commercialisation they wouldn’t insist on CC BY.” </div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal">Nevertheless, Anderson too is sceptical about KU’s business model. “I have to confess that the KU plan has never made much sense to me from the very beginning”.</div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal">The KU story is an interesting one. More importantly, however, I think it is instructional, since it invites wider questions about open access and the open access movement. For instance, it draws our attention to the <span class="MsoHyperlink"><a href="http://blogs.lse.ac.uk/impactofsocialsciences/2017/08/15/scholarly-communications-shouldnt-just-be-open-but-non-profit-too/">growing anxiety</a></span> amongst OA advocates about the role of for-profit companies in scholarly communication. </div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal">It is striking, for instance, that an organisation whose founder was just three years ago on the verge of calling it a day is now viewed as a dangerous shark in the OA waters bent on monopolising the monograph business. But perhaps there are good reasons for OA advocates to be anxious: we have learned that in an online world first movers in any new platform market can quickly come to dominate and control that market (and we have a new term for this: “<span class="MsoHyperlink"><a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Platform-Capitalism-Theory-Redux-Srnicek/dp/1509504877">platform capitalism</a></span>”). </div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal">At the same time a view has emerged that says that the real issue here is not whether an organisation is for- or non-profit, but the degree to which it is willing to embrace openness. And many now believe that openness in scholarly communication needs to encompass not just the <i>content</i> being distributed, but all parts of the <i>infrastructure</i> that allows that distribution to take place. </div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal">Thus, we can see growing calls for “open infrastructures”. This is necessary, the authors of <span class="MsoHyperlink"><a href="https://cameronneylon.net/blog/principles-for-open-scholarly-infrastructures/">this 2015 piece</a></span> explain, because, “Everything we have gained by opening content and data will be under threat if we allow the enclosure of scholarly infrastructures.” </div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal">Interestingly, one of the authors of that document was <span class="MsoHyperlink"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cameron_Neylon">Cameron Neylon</a></span>, the new Executive Director of that part of KU that Sven Fund did not acquire – <span class="MsoHyperlink"><a href="http://www.kuresearch.org/">KU Research</a></span>.</div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal">We could also note that one of those advocating for this greater openness today is<span class="MsoHyperlink"><a href="https://about.hindawi.com/team/paul-peters/"> Paul Peters</a></span>, the CEO of for-profit OA publisher Hindawi. Last year Peters made a case for the necessity of what he refers to as <span class="MsoHyperlink"><a href="https://about.hindawi.com/blog/a-radically-open-approach-to-developing-infrastructure-for-open-science/">four basic principles of openness</a></span> in any model where commercial providers develop and maintain open scholarly communications infrastructure. These are: open source, open data, open integrations, and open contracts.</div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal">I hope to cover <span style="font-family: inherit;">these</span> wider issues in a future post.</div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal">Above all, the KU story is a timely reminder that we live in uncertain times, and we don’t know what the future holds. We certainly don’t know what the fate of the KU business model will be, or how successful the company will prove in its new for-profit status. </div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal">Whatever the future holds, Frances Pinter, through her work with KU, has surely helped move our thinking forward. She has also conducted a real-life experiment at a time when experimentation is vital. If she risked some of her own pension in order to do that then it is to her greater credit.</div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal">But please read the interview with Frances Pinter below for a fuller picture of the KU story. </div><div class="MsoNormal"></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-B5pWIHDTsR8/W_pME3Tw8cI/AAAAAAAAiDU/FBQXtGF9BO4Hfhj5lbEbogRIasAZEZLEgCLcBGAs/s1600/FP%2BCropped.jpg" style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;"><img border="0" data-original-height="514" data-original-width="439" height="200" src="https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-B5pWIHDTsR8/W_pME3Tw8cI/AAAAAAAAiDU/FBQXtGF9BO4Hfhj5lbEbogRIasAZEZLEgCLcBGAs/s200/FP%2BCropped.jpg" width="170" /></a></div><br /><h2><a href="https://www.blogger.com/null" name="_Hlk530666633"><span style="font-size: large;">The interview begins …</span></a></h2><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal"><b><i>RP: I understand that you founded Knowledge Unlatched (KU) in 2012 in order to, as you </i></b><a href="http://www.knowledgeunlatched.org/2013/01/an-interview-with-frances-pinter/"><b><i>put it</i></b></a><b><i>, “change the way we fund the publishing of quality content” for book-length publications. To this end KU began inviting research libraries to pool money in order to fund the “fixed costs” of publishing OA<span style="font-family: inherit;"> mono</span>graphs. The idea is that this allows PDF and HTML versions of “unlatched” books to be made freely available on the Web, with premium versions sold in the traditional way. And those libraries who have contributed to the pool are able to buy the premium versions (including, presumably, print copies) of the books at a special discounted price. Is that an accurate description? </i></b></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal"><b>FP: </b>A full explanation of the original concept for the Knowledge Unlatched model can be found in the detailed <a href="https://culturalscience.org/articles/abstract/10.5334/csci.68/">report on the pilot project</a>. The description you give is accurate as far as it goes but misses important details.</div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal">Knowledge Unlatched was conceived as a crowdfunding model. In its early stages, it was focused on libraries. This was to ensure that we understood, and were able to respond to, the needs of a clearly defined community. </div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal">Initially, libraries indicated a preference for the OA version of titles to be made available as a fully downloadable PDF. ePub is now more widely used and the OA versions of Knowledge Unlatched titles are now often available in ePub format. Print and retail ebooks continue to remain available through the normal commercial channels.</div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal">As Knowledge Unlatched moved beyond the proof of concept and pilot it has been exploring a wider range of constituencies. Supporters of OA through Knowledge Unlatched now include learned societies, and even individuals. An example is <a href="http://langsci-press.org/">Language Science Press</a>, which works with Knowledge Unlatched as its crowdfunding agent.</div><div class="MsoListParagraphCxSpFirst" style="line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;"><br /></div><div class="MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle" style="line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;"><b><i><span>RP: The formula appears to have </span><span style="font-family: inherit; font-size: 12.0pt;">been</span><span> successful: I understand KU is now the largest gatekeeper to OA scholarly books. What aspect of KU’s success do you take particular pride in and why?</span></i></b></div><div class="MsoListParagraphCxSpLast" style="line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal"><b>FP:</b> The term ‘gatekeeper’ is an odd choice of word. I’ve always thought of KU as a ‘facilitator’ of OA. Knowledge Unlatched facilitates OA for books that have already passed the editorial threshold for a monograph publisher. Knowledge Unlatched should certainly not be the only model for funding OA monographs. </div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal">I would suggest that ‘largest’ is also misleading. Knowledge Unlatched has succeeded in crowdfunding OA for a few hundred front-list and a similar number of backlist titles each year. In the context of around 30 thousand monographs published annually in English (an estimate from <a href="https://royalhistsoc.org/person/richard-fisher/">Richard Fisher</a> and others) <a href="http://www.oapen.org/search?f1-language=English">over 4,000 English language monographs in the OAPEN index</a>, and well over 10,000 listed in DOAB, Knowledge Unlatched is a small part of the overall landscape. </div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal">I am most proud of the fact that we changed people’s thinking about possible approaches to funding OA publishing. Regardless of whether or not the core Knowledge Unlatched model ultimately turns out to be one of the better models for supporting OA, Knowledge Unlatched has encouraged people to think about new approaches to supporting the costs of high-quality OA publishing. </div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal">Rick Anderson has described <a href="https://scholarlykitchen.sspnet.org/2015/09/22/proof-of-concept-proof-of-program-and-proof-of-scale-in-scholarly-communication/">three levels of proof</a> for ongoing projects or initiatives in scholarly communication – they are proof of concept, proof of program and proof of scalability. I succeeded in providing the scholarly communications community with a proof of concept for a new approach. It is now up to others to adapt and learn from this proof of concept – and to continue driving the OA agenda forward.</div><div class="MsoListParagraphCxSpFirst" style="line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;"><br /></div><div class="MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle" style="line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;"><b><i><span>RP: In addition to enabling OA the expectation was that the KU model would lower the costs of monograph publishing. I am wondering how this works. Production costs aside, there is still an intermediary to be paid (KU), which is presumably charging both libraries and publishers for the services it provides. So, there are still intermediary costs to factor in. Have we yet seen prices fall? If so, by how much do you estimate they have fallen? </span></i></b></div><div class="MsoListParagraphCxSpLast" style="line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal"><b>FP: </b>We know from <a href="https://academicbookfuture.org/discoverability-demand-and-access-the-role-of-intermediaries-in-the-uk-supply-chain-for-academic-books-richard-fisher-and-michael-jubb/">work by Michael Jubb and Richard Fisher</a> that intermediaries can take as much as 50% of the cost of a book that is paid by libraries. Knowledge Unlatched charges 15% of the BPC [<a href="https://www.nature.com/openresearch/publishing-with-palgrave-macmillan/publication-charges/">Book Publication Charge</a>] equivalent to cover coordination costs. This is used to pay staff and to market the packages to potential contributors.</div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal">An important principle and contributor to the success of the Knowledge Unlatched pilot mode was to not interfere with, or set, input costs. <a href="https://sr.ithaka.org/publications/the-costs-of-publishing-monographs/">The Maron Report</a> shows there are huge variations in ‘getting to first copy’ publishing costs. </div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal">In the longer term, it is possible to speculate that both the coordination costs and the input costs could fall. To achieve a reduction of the coordination costs requires substantial scaling up which was not feasible with the capital available to KU as originally constituted. </div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal">An important contribution of the Knowledge Unlatched model is that it makes it possible for publishers to receive an upfront payment. By helping publishers to recoup the costs of publishing a monograph early in its life-cycle the Knowledge Unlatched model reduces the risks associated with publishing. </div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal">For instance, publishers may then choose to produce paperback versions at lower prices as soon as a book is published – where they might otherwise have had to stick to the hardback format in order to recover their input costs before making paperback versions of a title available.

After the proof of concept phase our financial modelling showed that if Knowledge Unlatched was able to achieve a sufficient volume to support core overhead and marketing costs, it could be sustainable. What was required was a capital investment to reach this scale.</div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal">This capital was hard to raise. As a not-for-profit CIC with few assets, we were not able to take on commercial loans. Grant-giving bodies and philanthropic funders regarded the proof of concept as a success – and therefore not requiring further funding from them. <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/lucy-montgomery-8929a41/?originalSubdomain=au">Lucy Montgomery’s</a> ability to continue working full time on Knowledge Unlatched had come to an end (she had been funded by a Vice Chancellor’s Research Fellowship from an Australian University, and her fellowship term had concluded). </div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal">Like many such efforts seeking funding to expand to sustainability, Knowledge Unlatched was neither fish nor fowl – not seen as an investment opportunity with future returns, nor appropriate for grants. Despite approaching several players with both capital and a potential strategic interest we could not raise the necessary funding. </div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal">I was at the point of calling it a day, and in any case was seriously stretched myself as CEO of Manchester University Press. </div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal">However, others urged us to continue beyond proof of concept. I therefore provided the capital personally by loaning the CIC a small six-figure amount of money (obtained from my pension savings) to continue covering costs. That is, I provided a loan to KU CIC to cover the running costs of the second round, which was launched in 2015.</div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal">We also secured some additional funding from <a href="https://www.curtin.edu.au/">Curtin University</a> in Australia and in the second pilot round we doubled the number of publishers and tripled the number of books. </div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal">Then in late 2015 Sven Fund – who had already left de Gruyter and was setting up fullstopp – made an offer for some of the Knowledge Unlatched CIC assets, which we accepted. The agreement with fullstopp was completed at the end of March 2016.<br /><br />At that point, I handed over Knowledge Unlatched operations to manage the coordination of monograph funding to Sven. I helped out a bit in the next 12 transition months, in order to maximise the chances that Knowledge Unlatched would scale successfully.</div><div class="MsoNormal"></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal">After the sale, in 2016 the GmbH paid for some CIC staff time (including a small amount of my time) for assistance over a transition period of a year. </div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal">The only person permanently on the payroll of the CIC was the partnership manager who continued working for Knowledge Unlatched CIC part-time from 2016 through to early 2017.</div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoListParagraphCxSpFirst" style="line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;"><b><i><span>RP: You say Sven Fund made an offer for some of the Knowledge Unlatched CIC assets and you accepted.

<p><em>By</em> <a href="http://www.psychologywriter.org.uk/">Christian Jarrett</a></p>
<p>Writing in the last century, Abraham Maslow (pictured left), one of the founders of Humanistic Psychology, proposed that the path to self-transcendence, and ultimately a greater compassion for all of humanity, requires “<a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2018/05/17/there-are-a-lot-of-myths-and-misconceptions-about-abraham-maslow-and-self-actualisation-a-new-paper-puts-the-record-straight/">self-actualisation</a>” – that is, fulfilling your true potential and becoming your authentic self.</p>
<p>Now Scott Barry Kaufman, a psychologist at Barnard College, Columbia University, believes it is time to revive the concept and link it with contemporary psychological theory. “We live in times of increasing divides, selfish concerns, and individualistic pursuits of power,” Kaufman wrote recently in <i>Scientific American </i>in a <a href="https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/beautiful-minds/what-does-it-mean-to-be-self-actualized-in-the-21st-century/">blog post</a> introducing his new research. He hopes that rediscovering the principles of self-actualisation may be just the tonic that the modern world is crying out for. To this end, he’s used modern statistical methods to create a test of self-actualisation, or more specifically, of the 10 characteristics exhibited by self-actualised people, and it’s <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0022167818809187">published in the <em>Journal of Humanistic Psychology</em></a>.</p>
<p><span id="more-35345"></span></p>
<p>Kaufman first surveyed online participants using the 17 characteristics that Maslow believed were shared by self-actualised people, but he found 7 of these were redundant or irrelevant and did not correlate with others, leaving 10 key characteristics of self-actualisation.</p>
<p>Next, he reworded some of Maslow’s original language and labelling to compile a modern 30-item questionnaire featuring 3 items tapping each of these 10 remaining characteristics: Continued freshness of appreciation; Acceptance; Authenticity; Equanimity; Purpose; Efficient perception of reality; Humanitarianism; Peak Experiences; Good moral intuition; and Creative Spirit (see the full questionnaire below and <a href="https://www.scottbarrykaufman.com/characteristics-of-self-actualization-scale/">take the test on Kaufman’s website</a>; our report on the findings continues underneath).</p>

<p>In a survey of over 500 people on Amazon’s Mechanical Turk website, Kaufman found that scores on each of these 10 characteristics tended to correlate, but also that they each made a unique contribution to a unifying factor of self-actualisation – suggesting that this is a valid concept that is comprised of 10 sub-traits.</p>
<p>Participants’ total scores on the test also correlated with their scores on the main five personality traits (that is, with higher extraversion, agreeableness, emotional stability, openness and conscientiousness) and with the meta-trait of “stability”, indicative of an ability to avoid impulses in the pursuit of one’s goals. That the new test corresponded in this way with established personality measures provides further evidence of its validity.</p>
<p>Next, Kaufman turned to modern theories of well-being, such as self-determination theory, to see if people’s scores on his self-actualisation scale correlated with these contemporary measures. Sure enough, he found that people with more characteristics of self-actualisation also tended to score higher on curiosity, life-satisfaction, self-acceptance, personal growth and autonomy, among other factors – just as Maslow would have predicted.</p>
<p>“Taken together, this total pattern of data supports Maslow’s contention that self-actualised individuals are more motivated by growth and exploration than by fulfilling deficiencies in basic needs,” Kaufman writes. He adds that the new empirical support for Maslow’s ideas is “quite remarkable” given that Maslow put them together with “a paucity of actual evidence”.</p>
<p>A criticism often levelled at Maslow’s notion of self-actualisation is that its pursuit encourages an ego-centric, selfish focus on one’s own goals and needs. However, Maslow always contended that it is only through becoming our true, authentic selves that we can transcend the self and look outward with compassion to the rest of humanity. Kaufman explored this too and found that higher scorers on his characteristics of self-actualisation scale tended to also score higher on feelings of oneness with the world, but not on decreased self-salience (the two main factors in a modern measure of self-transcendence developed by David Yaden).</p>
<p>Kaufman said this last finding supports “…Maslow’s contention that self-actualising individuals are able to paradoxically merge with a common humanity while at the same time able to maintain a strong identity and sense of self.”</p>
<p>Where the new data contradict Maslow is on the demographic factors that correlate with characteristics of self-actualisation – he thought that self-actualisation was rare and almost impossible for young people. Kaufman, by contrast, found scores on his new scale to be normally distributed through his sample (that is spread evenly like height or weight) and unrelated to factors like age, gender and educational attainment (although in personal correspondence, Kaufman informs me that newer data – over 3000 people have now taken the new test – is showing a small, but statistically significant association between older age and having more characteristics of self-actualisation).</p>
<p>Concluding his paper, Kaufman writes that “[H]opefully the current study … brings Maslow’s motivational framework and the central personality characteristics described by the founding humanistic psychologists, into the 21st century.”</p>
<p>The new test is sure to reinvigorate Maslow’s ideas, but if this is to help heal our divided world, then the characteristics required for self-actualisation, rather than being a permanent feature of our personalities, must be something we can develop deliberately. I put this point to Kaufman and he is optimistic. “I think there is significant room to develop these characteristics [by changing your habits],” he told me. “A good way to start with that,” he added, “is by first identifying where you stand on those characteristics and assessing your weakest links. Capitalize on your highest characteristics but also don’t forget to intentionally be mindful about what might be blocking your self-actualization. … Identify your patterns and make a concerted effort to change. I do think it’s possible with conscientiousness and willpower.”</p>

<p>A picture is worth a thousand words…. When it comes to conveying a concept, this sentiment can<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>certainly be true. But it may also be the case for memory. At least that’s the message from Myra Fernandes and colleagues at the University of Waterloo, Canada – <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/0963721418755385">writing in</a> <em>Current Directions in Psychological Science</em>, they argue that their research programme shows that drawing has a “surprisingly powerful influence” on memory, and as a mnemonic technique, it could be particularly useful for older adults – and even people with dementia.</p>

<p>Fernandes and her colleagues first established what they call the “<a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2016/04/08/want-to-remember-something-draw-it/">drawing effect</a>” – getting people to draw quick pictures of words in a list (such as “truck” or “pear”) led to much better recall of those words than writing them out multiple times. Creating just a four-second drawing was also superior to imagining the items or viewing pictures of the words.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>This was proof of principle type work. The researchers next looked at whether drawing aids memory of more complex terms and concepts. They found that study participants who had a minute to draw an image representing “isotope” or “spore”, for example, were more likely to remember the meaning than people who were asked to copy out the definitions instead. “As with single words, we reasoned that drawing facilitates retention, at least in part, because it requires elaboration on the meaning of the term and translating the definition to a new form (a picture),” the researchers write.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>In fact, there are various components to the process of drawing a picture of a word or concept, each of which seem to cumulatively aid memory. Getting people to trace over an existing drawing (so getting them to make relevant arm and hand movements, but not allowing personal elaboration), or to create a drawing which they were then not allowed to see (so allowing the physical movements and personal elaboration, but depriving them of the visual memory of the end result) both improved memory – but not as much as when all of these stages were allowed. “Memory scaled up as components were added to the encoding task,” the researchers note.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Fernandes and her colleagues went on to find that although older adults performed worse than younger adults at remembering words they had learned by writing, there was no difference between the two age groups in their ability to remember words they had drawn. Encouraged by these results, the team then asked 13 people diagnosed with dementia and living in a long-term care facility to either draw or write 60 words that were read aloud by an experimenter. The results showed a “massive” memory benefit for words that had been drawn rather than written. If it can be shown that drawing also helps with other sorts of memory – for where things are kept, perhaps –<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>this strategy could be practically useful for people with dementia.</p>
<p>In some cases, the patients’ drawings looked just like scribbles. But how good – or bad – the drawings were didn’t seem to matter. In fact, in most of the experiments, the researchers assessed their participants’ ability to create vivid images and also their experience at drawing, and neither was correlated with memory performance. Even people who struggle to create a stick figure should, then, get memory benefits from drawing.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>There’s still plenty of work to be done to investigate whether drawing terms, events or concepts that you want to recall can bring real-world benefits – whether in the classroom or in a care home. But this is a comprehensive set of studies, all pointing in the same direction. “Taken together, the evidence…demonstrates that drawing is a robust encoding strategy that can, and does, improve memory performance dramatically,” the researchers conclude.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

Death? Pain? A painful death?<br /><br />Devils, demons, ghosts, witches, and other supernatural apparitions? This latter category (haunting, demon possession) is common among many cultures with religious or spiritual practices, and can evoke primal fear.

It can feel like you're frozen in bed, aware of your surroundings yet completely paralyzed. This  is because the complete muscle atonia typically experienced during <a class="mw-redirect" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/REM_sleep" title="Rapid Eye Movement sleep">REM sleep</a> has oozed into lighter stages of <a class="mw-redirect" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-REM_sleep" title="Non-REM sleep">non-REM sleep</a>. Scary dream imagery can intrude while in this state, making it even worse.<br /><br />A fascinating new paper covers interpretations of this frightening phenomenon across different cultures (<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6082011/?report=printable" target="_blank">Olunu et al., 2018</a>). A common theme is being attacked, visited, or sat upon by supernatural beings, such as demons, witches, ghosts, and spirits.<br /><br /><br /><div style="text-align: center;"><b><span><span style="font-size: x-small;">-- click on image for a larger view --</span></span></b></div><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-Korm5YY50fQ/W-iJLfAyx8I/AAAAAAAAMro/Y9Z08I30EYYU3JGq65tKcOR1VaOA3jnjACLcBGAs/s1600/Sleep%2Bparalysis_edit.png" style="margin-left: 0em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" data-original-height="1050" data-original-width="1050" height="400" src="https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-Korm5YY50fQ/W-iJLfAyx8I/AAAAAAAAMro/Y9Z08I30EYYU3JGq65tKcOR1VaOA3jnjACLcBGAs/s400/Sleep%2Bparalysis_edit.png" width="400" /></a></div><br />The eerie presences are called <i>Jinn</i> in Egypt, <i>Kabus</i> in Iran, <i>Phi Um</i> in Thailand, <i>Old Hag</i> in lots of places, and the especially horrifying <i>Kokma</i>  in Saint Lucia, which are “attacks by dead spirits or unbaptized babies that jump into a body and squeeze the throat”. In Nigeria, believers in supernatural explanations exist alongside others who hold rational explanations: <br /><blockquote class="tr_bq">Nigerians describe it as “visitation of an evil spirit, witches, or some form of spiritual attack.” Others have beliefs that it may be due to anxiety or emotions associated with family problems. </blockquote>The Wikipedia page on the folklore of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Night_hag#Folklore" target="_blank">night hag</a> also has a pretty good listing.<br /><br /><br />Interestingly, sleep paralysis was considered as a partial explanation for “demonic possession” in the case of Louisa Muskovits (<a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2018/12/catholic-exorcisms-on-the-rise/573943/" target="_blank"><i>Atlantic</i></a>): <br /><blockquote class="tr_bq">Louisa seemed to vacillate between this unhinged state and her normal  self. One minute she would snarl and bare her teeth, and the next she  would beg for help. “It definitely had this appearance where she was  fighting within herself,” Harp [her former therapist] told me.<br /><br />. . . <br />[Another time] Louisa ... woke  up abruptly, only to find her body locked in place—but with the added  shock of what seemed to be visual hallucinations, including one of a  giant spider crawling into her bedroom. Louisa was so jolted that she  barely ate or slept for three days. “I didn’t feel safe,” she said. “I felt violated.” <br /><br />. . .<br />Sleep paralysis seemed like a promising explanation. A phenomenon in which sufferers move too quickly in and out of rem sleep for the body to keep up, sleep paralysis causes a person’s mind to wake up before the body can shake off the effects of sleep. Hovering near full consciousness, the person can experience paralysis and hallucinations.<br /><br />But Louisa didn’t think this could account for the hand on her collarbone, which she swore she’d felt while she was completely awake [<i>oh of course it can account for this phenomenology!</i>].</blockquote><br /><br /><span style="font-size: large;">What are your experiences of sleep paralysis?</span><br /><br /><br /><b>Further Reading</b><br /><br /><a href="http://neurocritic.blogspot.com/2013/12/when-waking-up-becomes-nightmare.html">When Waking Up Becomes the Nightmare: Hypnopompic Hallucinatory Pain</a><br /><br /><a href="http://neurocritic.blogspot.com/2011/09/phenomenology-of-pain-during-rem-sleep.html">The Phenomenology of Pain During REM Sleep</a><br /><br /><a href="http://neurocritic.blogspot.com/2011/09/neurophysiology-of-pain-during-rem.html">The Neurophysiology of Pain During REM Sleep</a><br /><br /><a href="http://neurocritic.blogspot.com/2013/01/possession-trance-disorder-in-dsm-5.html">Possession Trance Disorder in DSM-5</a><br /><br /><a href="http://neurocritic.blogspot.com/2013/01/spirit-possession-as-trauma-related.html">Spirit Possession as a Trauma-Related Disorder in Uganda</a><br /><br /><a href="http://neurocritic.blogspot.com/2013/01/the-spirit-came-for-me-when-i-went-to.html">"The spirit came for me when I went to fetch firewood" - Personal Narrative of Spirit Possession in Uganda</a><br /><br /><a href="http://neurocritic.blogspot.com/2013/08/possession-trance-disorder-caused-by.html">Possession Trance Disorder Caused by Door-to-Door Sales</a><br /><br /><a href="http://neurocritic.blogspot.com/2012/05/fatal-hypernatraemia-from-exessive-salt.html">Fatal Hypernatraemia from Excessive Salt Ingestion During Exorcism</a><br /><br /><a href="http://neurocritic.blogspot.com/2010/10/diagnostic-criteria-for-demonic.html">Diagnostic Criteria for Demonic Possession</a><br /><br /><a href="http://neurocritic.blogspot.com/2017/10/the-devilish-side-of-psychiatry.html">The Devilish Side of Psychiatry</a><br /><br /><br /><b>Reference</b><br /><br />Olunu E, Kimo R, Onigbinde EO, Akpanobong MU, Enang IE, Osanakpo M, Monday IT, Otohinoyi DA, John Fakoya AO.

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><em>By guest blogger</em> <a href="http://www.jessesingal.com/">Jesse Singal</a></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">How important is your country, really? It’s a pointed question, especially with Brexit looming and the reinvigoration of nationalistic movements in the U.S. and EU. So it feels like a fitting time to look at a creative study that evaluated differences in, well, national self-importance.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In </span><a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2211368118300202"><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We Made History: Citizens of 35 Countries Overestimate Their Nation’s Role in World History”</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, published in the </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Journal of Applied Research in Memory and Cognition</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a team led by Franklin M. Zaromb of Israel’s National Authority for Measurement and Evaluation in Education surveyed thousands of students across the world to better gauge their beliefs about world history and their countries’ place in it. (You can view the survey itself </span><a href="https://osf.io/wj378/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">here</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.)</span></p>
<p><span id="more-35348"></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A subset of the students — 6,185 from 35 countries once fishy and incomplete responses were excluded — were asked “What contribution do you think the country you are living in has made to world history?” They were instructed to respond with a percentage from 0 to 100. (“Participants were all citizens of their respective countries,” the authors note — no exchange students here.)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As Zaromb’s team acknowledge, this is a somewhat odd question. There is of course no way to assign a percentage of history-making to a given country in anything like an objective or rigorous way (how many </span><a href="https://singingrevolution.com/about-the-history"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Singing Revolutions</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> equals one Pearl Harbour?). But that was sort of the point: The goal of the survey was to better understand students’ potential feelings of “</span><a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2016/12/09/theres-such-a-thing-as-collective-narcissism-and-it-might-explain-a-lot-thats-going-on-at-the-moment/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">collective narcissism</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">” or “the phenomenon of people showing excessive pride in one’s own group”, as well as the biases that go into making numerically noisy judgements. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One could be forgiven for imagining that my fellow Americans, more than the citizens of other nations, would be the ones to view their country as the most historically important. After all, the concept of “American exceptionalism” is pretty baked into U.S. culture. But as it turned out, Americans were in the bottom half — on average, those students, who were from Washington University in St. Louis, estimated that their country contributed 29.6 per cent of world history. That’s of course a ridiculous overestimate — especially given that the U.S., having been founded as an independent nation in 1776, has only been around for a tiny fraction of human history — but 29.6 per cent was a positively humble estimate relative to those made by students from the countries with the three highest average estimates: Russia (60.8 per cent), the U.K. (54.6 per cent), and India (53.9 per cent). The three humblest (relatively speaking) countries were Switzerland (11.3 per cent), Norway (12.3 per cent), and New Zealand (17.7 per cent). By any conceivably reasonable standard, of course, these are </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">all</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> overestimates. The researchers dubbed this apparently universal (at least among these samples) tendency to overrate the historical importance of one’s country’s </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">national narcissism</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The researchers also asked the respondents questions geared at measuring their levels of national pride and loyalty to see how that was related to their level of national narcissism. And while there was a statistically significant correlation between the two, it wasn’t all that large (r = .2, meaning national pride/loyalty could explain 4 per cent of the variance in the estimates of national narcissism), and it was quite heterogeneous: For many countries it was significantly larger or smaller than r = .2, or wasn’t statistically significant at all (for what it’s worth, there was no country where the correlation was both negative and significant).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While the findings here are certainly interesting, there are many limitations to keep in mind. These aren’t true national averages, for one thing, since the samples, all drawn from a single university per country, are quite susceptible to selection bias: In the U.S., for example, Washington University in St. Louis is a highly ranked school known for having a fairly wealthy student body. Students there might have a very different view about America’s contributions to history than what one might find surveying a different slice of Americans (in case you’re wondering, the U.K. sample attended Brunel University, London). The study’s entire sample also skewed rather female (60.2 per cent), for what that’s worth.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But it’s still interesting that students from 35 nations calculated that their nations were, in sum, responsible for 1,156.4 per cent of human history. What can this tell us?</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A couple of things, potentially. As Zaromb and his colleagues point out, this could be seen as an example of the availability heuristic — a cognitive error in which we overestimate certain things because we can so easily call examples to mind. In this case, the respondents, being students, were likely able to come up with many examples of historically important things that involved their country — Norwegian students learn Norwegian history, after all — and as a result overestimated the historical importance of their homelands. Now, as the authors note, the question about percentages did come near the end of a longer survey in which respondents were also “asked about their knowledge of important historical figures and events from around the world”, based on a “list of 40 people and events [that were] distributed throughout the world, with no one country dominant”. In theory, this might have reduced the impact of the availability heuristic, since it would prime respondents to think of events in </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">other</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> countries. But by that same token, citizens of the biggest countries saw their countries </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">over-represented</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on that list. By my count, for example, 10 of the 20 events directly involved the U.S. For an American student, then, the list could run the risk of actually exacerbating the availability heuristic, since it contains so many examples of historical events that directly involved the U.S. (A Swiss or Norwegian student, on the other hand, wouldn’t be similarly primed, though perhaps being exposed to many historical events could cause them to think about </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">their countries’</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> responses to those events.) </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This study could also be seen as evidence for a cousin of the famous </span><a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/culture-conscious/201205/occupy-lake-wobegon"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lake Wobegon effect</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, or the tendency of people to overestimate their abilities, leading a majority of individuals to view themselves as “above average” in various domains. It shouldn’t be surprising, given what we know about in-group psychology, that people often err similarly when evaluating their own groups relative to others.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It would be fascinating to see a study like this repeated on a larger, more cross-nationally representative group of respondents. One could make a case for more highly educated people both overestimating or underestimating their countries’ historical importance, relative to less educated ones (maybe the highly educated, knowing more history, are hit harder by the availability heuristic — or maybe they’re simply better with numbers, so the less educated would make even </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">higher </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">estimates).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As of now, the researchers admit they aren’t quite sure why they found what they found. “None of our measures accounted for much of the variance [in national narcissism], nor were estimates especially inflated in individualistic societies compared to collectivistic societies… National narcissism was higher in materialistic, more collectivistic and hierarchical cultures, but explained variance was small.” There’s a lot more work to be done to better understand this phenomenon, in other words, and the first step will be to harvest data from bigger, more nationally representative samples.</span></p>

<img alt="" class="attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image" height="110" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2018/11/laptop-140x110.jpg" style="display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;" width="140" /><p>Health professionals express concern when we see patients influenced by medical misinformation. We know that poor-quality information is convenient and widespread. We worry that it will lead people down pathways that diverge from professional guidance. We are uneasy when we consider the potentially devastating health effects of such deviations. We have seen first-hand howmisinformation can negatively influence health behaviors in areas like <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/health-45990874">vaccines</a> and <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/kavinsenapathy/2016/12/23/naturalnonsense-friends-dont-let-friends-read-natural-news/">cancer</a> treatment.</p>
<p>Educators express <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/education/2013/may/13/should-university-students-use-wikipedia">frustration</a> when we see students use abundant, lower quality sources of information while they are training. We watch as they collectively cut corners, meaning the trails of their habits are self-reinforced. With health professional students, we fear the resulting lack of practice in using high quality evidence will influence medical decision-making in patient care. Furthermore, we find that after graduation, even those who can use strong health evidence often cannot adapt medical terminology to meet the literacy needs of their patients.</p>
<p>What can we do about these challenges? We can sigh, grumble, and finger point. We can lecture our patients and our trainees about the woes of seeking medical information from the same sources they use to find information about their hobbies, pop culture, politics, and the like. We can shout that clinicians don’t communicate information at a level appropriate to the lay public, driving the most vulnerable to the sources that do. We can keep teaching the way we have been teaching, watching the distance between educators and students grow.</p>
<p>Or we can respect that patients, health professionals, and students have chosen their preferred route. <a href="https://wikiedu.org/blog/2016/10/27/new-videos-feature-ucsf-faculty-encouraging-others-to-teach-with-wikipedia/">We can advocate for new methods</a>. Wikipedia is the most used online resource for health information worldwide. Although it was not originally intended to provide health information, it has proved to be what transportation planners call a “desire path,” i.e., an informal shortcut created to more easily arrive at a destination (see Figure 1). This desire path has become well-trodden. So why not legitimize and strengthen it by teaching health professional students to edit and improve Wikipedia pages? Why not use tools designed specifically for that purpose to monitor the impact of their edits? When we pave this desire path, we have the potential for <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29683009">dual benefits</a> – both students and patients can learn.</p>
<figure class="wp-caption alignleft" id="attachment_10687" style="width: 411px;"><img alt="" class=" wp-image-10687" height="267" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2018/11/walking-trail-1031654_1920-300x200.jpg" width="401" /><div class="attachment-image--caption">Pixabay</div><div class="attachment-image--source"></div></figure>
<p>Building on the example of an innovative <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2013/09/30/business/media/editing-wikipedia-pages-for-med-school-credit.html">Wikipedia editing elective</a> at the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF) School of Medicine, we saw an opportunity to improve a traditional educational activity in the UCSF School of Pharmacy. Instead of the usual academic practice of having pharmacy students write and edit summaries of key information about new medicines, we had them improve information about specific medicines posted on Wikipedia. We then evaluated whether they developed the professional communication skills expected, and at the same time provided better information to a wider audience.</p>
<p>The project we used as a role model, which involved UCSF medical students, included up to a dozen self-selected students completing an intensive elective unit, in which individual Wikipedia editing was the only academic commitment. For our pharmacy project, we were interested in determining whether similar outcomes were achievable on a larger scale. Our study enlisted an entire class cohort of more than 100 students. Wikipedia editing was only one of many assignments the students completed in across multiple classes during that term. To compensate for these competing demands, the pharmacy students worked in small groups and received support through peer training. For a summary of the Wikipedia-inclusive medical and pharmacy courses at UCSF, see Figure 2.</p>
<p>Our results suggest that editing medicines-related Wikipedia pages as an educational activity can improve both public-facing information and student communication skills. The impact of the student edits on the Wikipedia pages was substantial; demonstrated by improvements in the accuracy and comprehensiveness of the medicines pages and increased page views, which amplified the results of the intervention.</p>
<figure class="wp-caption alignright" id="attachment_10689" style="width: 337px;"><img alt="" class=" wp-image-10689" height="218" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2018/11/office-594132_1920-300x200.jpg" width="327" /><div class="attachment-image--caption">Pixabay</div><div class="attachment-image--source"></div></figure>
<p>We also found that students learned more about the inner workings of Wikipedia and, as a result, many viewed this resource differently. A few said that they would consider editing Wikipedia pages again in the future, suggesting that this type of assignment can motivate continued efforts to improve public health information outside of formal assignments.</p>
<p>Encouraging pharmacy students to play a role in improving health-related Wikipedia pages is both valuable and feasible. We suspect the dual benefit to students and to society is not limited to pharmacy. We call on other health professional education programs to embrace these “<a href="http://www.litsl.com/personal/commercial_success_by_looking_for_desire_lines.pdf">perfect expressions of natural purpose</a>” by adapting traditional health information assignments to include Wikipedia editing.</p>

<p>In western nations, the vast majority of sexually active women take the birth control pill at some point in their lives, usually to avoid becoming pregnant. Of increasing interest to some psychologists, the hormone-stabilising effects of the pill may have other important effects, including on the psyche and personal relationships, and these are the focus of a <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0941950018301763">new study</a> in <em>Neurology, Psychiatry and Brain Research. </em></p>

There also appear to be what Tenille Taggart at San Diego State University and her colleagues refer to as “downstream benefits” of taking the pill, including greater relationship <a href="http://rspb.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/279/1732/1430">stability</a> and <a href="https://web.a.ebscohost.com/abstract?direct=true&amp;profile=ehost&amp;scope=site&amp;authtype=crawler&amp;jrnl=21648204&amp;AN=117856159&amp;h=e2MK%2bOQRmwi2fc0xMPPeE7Rtzt2GS36ly0qPhqxROMh8PLDMh6K73yoHLT%2b1cTd2MOQQ9eQMknltLe0lzARNcQ%3d%3d&amp;crl=c&amp;resultNs=AdminWebAuth&amp;resultLocal=ErrCrlNotAuth&amp;crlhashurl=login.aspx%3fdirect%3dtrue%26profile%3dehost%26scope%3dsite%26authtype%3dcrawler%26jrnl%3d21648204%26AN%3d117856159">satisfaction</a>.</p>
<p>However, before now, no study has measured these two outcomes (emotional stability and relationship satisfaction) simultaneously. Taggart’s team have done this and their results suggest that a key reason that women who take the pill (oral contraceptives; OCs) tend to enjoy more satisfying relationships is because they have more stable emotions.</p>
<p>“Our results support previous findings that OCs may confer positive psychological benefits, and that one of these, mood stability, may have diffuse effects on women’s broader wellbeing and functioning,” they write.</p>
<p><span id="more-35240"></span></p>
<p>The research involved 282 women (average age 26-27 years) recruited via Amazon’s Mechanical Turk survey website. One hundred and ninety-nine of the women were not taking the oral contraceptive pill, while the remaining 83 were (and had been for an average of 33 months).</p>
<p>The women reported whether they experience mood swings, how often and how severely. They also answered questions about their relationship satisfaction.</p>
<p>Consistent with previous research, on average the women taking the pill reported fewer and less severe mood swings, and they had more satisfying relationships. Statistically speaking, Taggart and her team described the size of these group differences as “notable”.</p>
<p>The novel finding was that the greater emotional stability among the women on the pill mediated the greater relationship satisfaction they reported – that is, statistical analysis suggested that the greater relationship satisfaction in the group on the pill was partly explained by their also tending to have more stable emotions. In fact, 44 per cent of the variance in the women’s relationship satisfaction was accounted for by differences in their emotional stability.</p>
<p>Deeper analysis suggested it was specifically having fewer and less serious up and down mood swings that was related to relationship satisfaction, not having less negative emotion or more positive emotion per se. The researchers speculated that intensity and frequency of negative emotion may be more akin to a personality trait, and that it is specifically emotional lability (mood swings) that is reduced by the birth control pill.</p>
<p>The researchers said their findings “support public policy efforts aimed at providing broad, affordable access to contraceptives, including for non-contraceptive benefits, and discussing OCs as a potential treatment with all women, including those not at imminent risk for pregnancy”.</p>
<p>Others may worry that any potential benefits from this line of research would be outweighed by the stigmatising effect of spreading the idea that women’s emotions (rather than, say, gender inequality) are a problem that needs addressing.</p>
<p>Even for supporters of this research endeavour, more data is clearly needed, especially long-term studies that follow women (and ideally their partners too) over time, so that causal factors can be identified with more confidence. With the current cross-sectional design other interpretations of the results are feasible – for instance, perhaps it is relationship satisfaction that influences women’s choice to take the pill and also reduces their emotional lability.</p>

<img alt="" class="webfeedsFeaturedVisual wp-post-image" height="150" src="https://blogs.plos.org/plos/files/2018/04/Power-to-the-Preprint_blog-image-002-150x150.png" style="display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;" width="150" /><p><em>Dedicated team of Editorial Board Members are now actively seeking manuscripts in the Earth Sciences from preprint servers <a href="https://eartharxiv.org/">EarthArXiv</a> and <a href="https://www.essoar.org/">ESSoar</a>.</em></p>
<p>Preprint servers offer a myriad of <a href="https://www.plos.org/why-preprint">benefits</a> to authors who are excited to share their work with the community as soon as possible, so we’ve offered our authors the ease of automatically posting their life science submissions on <a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/">bioRxiv</a>. But <em><a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/">PLOS ONE</a></em> is a community of many different voices and we want to help promote preprints in all disciplines. This includes providing authors with more reasons to post a preprint – on top of the advantages that posting a preprint already offer such as faster dissemination and allowing for input from the whole community. We’re therefore delighted to announce the introduction of a new program to invite submissions of posted preprint manuscripts specifically in the Earth and Space sciences. Our aim is to support authors posting their papers with a fast and efficient peer review process and journal publication of their work.</p>
<p><strong>Introducing PLOS ONE Preprint Editors</strong></p>
<p>Going forward, we’ve tasked a small group of <em>PLOS ONE</em> Editorial Board members with reviewing and inviting preprint submissions from EarthArXiv and ESSOAr that they feel would be a good fit for the journal. This group will be led by Section Editors Guy Schumann (Bristol University, UK) and Juan Añel (University of Vigo, Spain) along with dedicated Preprint Editors, Xialoe Sun (Stockholm University, Sweden) and Julien Bouchez (Institut de Physique du Globe de Paris, France).</p>
<p><a href="http://blogs.plos.org/plos/files/2018/11/Preprint-editors_with-background.png"><img alt="" class="aligncenter wp-image-8389" height="132" src="http://blogs.plos.org/plos/files/2018/11/Preprint-editors_with-background.png" width="285" /></a></p>
<p>As part of this program, submissions invited through preprint servers will receive special attention from the staff editors which may include extra promotion on social media. Climate change papers may also be recommended to the “Responding to Climate Change” Channel, of which Juan Añel is also an editor.</p>
<p><em>“As a preprint editor one can have a substantial positive impact and contribute a potentially very high added-value to the scientific community of a particular research field.”</em></p>
<ul>
<li><em>Guy Schumann, Section Editor PLOS ONE</em></li>
</ul>
<p>We are truly excited to place this program in the hands of these individuals who’ve proven their dedication to their communities and eagerness to advance scholarly outputs for scientific communication in the Earth and Space sciences.</p>
<p><strong>Why we choose preprints</strong></p>
<p>Recruiting research from preprint servers is nothing new in academic publishing, other journals like <em>PLOS Genetics</em> and <em>eLife</em> already do so. Preprints represent huge opportunities for improvement on slow publication times. When it comes to critical issues like climate change and others, getting results out sooner can have a dramatic impact on our ability to advance science and foster early collaboration and debate on new research results.</p>
<p><em>“For me, a main advantage of preprints is that they can help to advance science faster, with public exposure of what is going on, what is cutting-edge”</em></p>
<ul>
<li><em>Juan Añel, Section Editor PLOS ONE</em></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>I’ve never posted a preprint before, should I?</strong></p>
<p>Yes! The benefits are endless. Preprints are an easy way to generate exposure for your research before you even decide where to submit (ESSOAr also accepts uploads of conference posters and other materials). When you post a preprint, you have immediate and unlimited reach allowing you stake the first claim on your methods and results, and even get early feedback from your community. Sounds great, right? Preprints are also beneficial for early career researchers who need discoverable, citable content that speaks to their academic contributions and can help advance their careers.</p>
<p><em>“Particularly for young scientists, who are the major driving force for science today and need a… good publication record to look for their next job, preprints would be a very [good] choice for them to publicize their findings in a timely way and “decorate” their CV”.</em></p>
<ul>
<li><em>Xiaole Sun, Preprint Editor PLOS ONE</em></li>
</ul>
<p>We encourage you to join us in our support of preprints, not just in the earth sciences but across all disciplines. Preprints are already one of the fastest growing research outputs, and we can all do our part to making it an even more successful outlet for new communities that are just beginning to explore its potential.</p>

<p><i>By</i> <a href="https://emmayoung.net/">Emma Young</a></p>
<p>Almost half of people with Obsessive Compulsive Disorder (OCD) have extreme fears about touching something they feel is “contaminated”. This can mean that after touching a doorknob, say, they then feel compelled to scrub their hands, in some cases even until they bleed.</p>
<p>Conventional treatments, which often involve a combination of a prescription drug (typically an “SSRI”, such as Prozac) plus cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT), help <a href="https://jonathanhaverkampf.ie/wp/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Treatment-Resistant-OCD-CJ-Haverkampf-J-Psychiatry-Psychotherapy-Communication-2014-Sep-30-3391-94.pdf">only about 60 per cent of people</a> with OCD, so there’s an urgent need for additional treatments. Now <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-33142-2">in <i>Scientific Reports</i></a>, Baland Jalal at the University of Cambridge and colleagues present initial data suggesting that a simple video intervention, delivered via a phone app, might help.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><span id="more-35289"></span></p>
<p>For this exploratory study, the researchers recruited 93 people from the local community with higher than average fears about contamination but without a diagnosis of OCD. The researchers made this recruitment decision in case their experimental treatment inadvertently worsened their participants’ symptoms, which would likely have been more serious for people with full OCD. But thankfully, as hoped, their intervention was helpful – after just a week, participants in the two intervention groups showed significant improvements, whereas members of the control group did not.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>The trial began with all the participants completing an initial battery of questionnaires and a clinical interview. The participants in the two intervention groups were then videoed for 30 seconds either touching toilet paper inside a bedpan that had been mocked up to look and smell as though it contained faeces, or washing their hands in a sink. The control participants were videoed making arbitrary hand gestures. These videos were then loaded into a smart-phone app, and on four occasions each day over the next 7 days, all the participants were then prompted, via the app, to watch their personalised video.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Watching the bedpan video was designed to be a potentially much less confronting, less time-consuming (and also less expensive) version of standard exposure-based CBT therapy. This involves progressively exposing the client to a “contaminated” object (like a toilet seat), which generates anxiety – but preventing them from washing themselves. By allowing clients to feel the eventual decrease in their anxiety levels, even in the absence of the washing, therapists help them to learn to overcome their contamination fears. The hand-washing video was designed with the hope that it would allow a kind of vicarious cleansing, assuaging the individual’s concerns about contamination without them having to actually go and wash their hands.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>On the eighth day, all the participants came back into the lab for follow-up testing. Both intervention groups showed a significant decrease in OCD symptoms, measured using the Yale-Brown Obsessive-Compulsive Scale. They also got better at a test of cognitive flexibility, which entails being able to shift attention as a situation changes. Their scores on the contamination fears scale did not decrease, but that might be because a week wasn’t long enough for them to recognise changes within themselves, the researchers suggest. (Members of the control group showed no changes on any of the measures.)<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Several participants described their own experiences. One in the hand-washing condition reported: “It felt as if I had washed my hands, so I didn’t need to wash my hands anymore…my hands were clean after using the app”. A member of the bedpan group said: “I have become desensitised to the video and other things as well. If I normally were to wipe a kitchen worktop, I would throw the cloth away because I felt it was disgusting to clean that cloth for another time. But since using the app I now use the cloth, clean it, and use it again another time.”</p>
<p>The next step is of course to investigate whether these interventions really can work as a treatment for OCD. As the researchers write, they are certainly worth investigating further, in part because they “are not only inexpensive and accessible but can be tailored for individual patients. They also have the potential for widespread implementation and could potentially reach communities that do not have access to adequate mental health care.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

<img alt="" class="attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image" height="110" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2018/11/AdobeStock_86183613-1-140x110.jpg" style="display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;" width="140" /><h3><strong>Lifestyle and healthcare interaction</strong></h3>
<p>We know that modifiable lifestyle factors such as smoking, being overweight or obese and drinking alcohol are related to <a href="https://scienceblog.cancerresearchuk.org/2018/03/23/new-calculations-confirm-lifestyle-changes-could-prevent-4-in-10-cancer-cases/">4 out of 10 cancers</a> and men are more likely to have at least one or more of these risk factors. Taking tobacco as an example, smoking in men has had a significant impact on the rates of certain cancer types, particularly lung, head and neck, bowel, bladder, pancreatic – cancers that can have particularly poor outcomes. Fortunately, smoking rates in men are now steadily falling and we’re starting to see a subsequent decline in the incidence of some of these cancers.</p>
<p>Another potential reason is that men are less likely to have as many opportunities for contact with health professionals across their lifetime in order to obtain health information or to report possible cancer-related symptoms. Women are more likely to have frequent contact on matters relating to contraception, pregnancy, child rearing or menopause and they have also had exposure to healthcare professional through participating in breast (and cervical) cancer screening for the past three decades.</p>
<p>In contrast, men have only recently had the opportunity to participate in such programs in the form of <a href="https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/bowel-cancer-screening/">bowel cancer screening</a>, but the test is conducted at home, which further limits opportunities for healthcare professional contact.</p>
<h3><strong>Sex differences</strong></h3>
<p>But what about inherent differences between the sexes, could they be responsible for some of these differences in cancer rates? Sex hormones, including oestrogens (the primary female sex hormone) and testosterone (the primary male sex hormone), are related to sex-specific cancers such as breast in women and prostate in men but surprisingly, little research has been conducted to see if they are involved in the development of cancers that affect both sexes.</p>
<blockquote><p>It’s unclear whether these observations represent a potentially protective effect for oestrogen or a detrimental effect for testosterone – or both.</p></blockquote>
<p>Cancers of the oesophagus (or food pipe) and stomach are particularly more common in <a href="https://bmccancer.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1471-2407-12-11">men than in women</a> and are cancers which are linked to poor outcomes. The difference in rates between the sexes is especially pronounced for <a href="https://www.cancer.gov/publications/dictionaries/cancer-terms/def/adenocarcinoma">adenocarcinomas</a>, the type that most commonly occurs in developed countries, with reports estimating up to a 7-fold difference in men compared to women.</p>
<p>The variation by sex is not fully explained by known risk factors such as smoking, obesity and gastroesophageal reflux and the male-to-female ratio is highest during female reproductive years, when oestrogen concentrations are highest. But it’s unclear whether these observations represent a potentially protective effect for oestrogen or a detrimental effect for testosterone – or both.</p>
<p>In the first study of reproductive and hormonal factors in men, we recently found that male pattern balding (used as a proxy for higher testosterone levels) was associated with a small increase in risk of <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ijc.31375">stomach cancer</a> and was more marked for adenocarcinomas among men enrolled in the <a href="https://www.ukbiobank.ac.uk/">UK Biobank</a>, a large UK cohort study. To investigate this further, we are conducting studies to examine the use of common hormone-modulating medications, in addition to circulating blood levels of sex hormones, in both men and women to see how these may impact subsequent risk of these cancers.</p>
<p>This research, along with the work of others, will provide insights into the possible biological reasons for the difference in oesophageal and stomach cancer rates between men and women and in the future, could lead to the identification of potentially exploitable prevention strategies. It’s important to point out though that this work is still very much in the early stages and additional research is required before any firm conclusions can be drawn.</p>
<h3><strong>What can men do to reduce cancer risk?</strong></h3>
<p>Unfortunately, it is unlikely that there is one single cause as to why men develop cancer more frequently compared to women. In addition to the investigation of potential biological factors, it’s clear that we need a focus on cancer prevention and early diagnosis and campaigns such as <a href="https://www.nhs.uk/be-clear-on-cancer">Be Clear on Cancer</a> in the UK are trying to address this – but increased and sustained efforts are needed.</p>
<p>So on this International Men’s Day, what can men do to reduce their overall risk of developing cancer in the future? The <a href="https://www.wcrf.org/dietandcancer/cancer-prevention-recommendations">World Cancer Research Fund</a>’s evidence-based recommendations for healthy lifestyle choices include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Be a healthy weight</li>
<li>Be physically active</li>
<li>Eat wholegrains, vegetables, fruits and beans</li>
<li>Limit the consumption of “fast-foods”</li>
<li>Limit consumption of red and processed meats</li>
<li>Limit alcohol intake</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition to healthy lifestyle choices, it’s important to <a href="https://www.cancer.org/healthy/find-cancer-early/mens-health/cancer-facts-for-men.html">know yourself</a>, your family history, and to tell your doctor if you notice a <a href="https://www.cancerresearchuk.org/about-cancer/cancer-symptoms/spot-cancer-early">change</a> which isn’t normal for you, such as a persistent cough, change in bowel movements or difficulty swallowing.</p>
