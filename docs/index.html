              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/venus-surface-photo-parker-solar-probe-space-nasa">These are the first visible-light images of Venus’ surface captured from space</a></h4>

              
                <p>By serendipity, scientists have photographed Venus’ surface from space for the first time.</p>



<p>Though the planet’s rocky body is concealed beneath a thick veil of clouds, telescopes aboard NASA’s Parker Solar Probe managed to capture the <a href="https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/2021GL096302">first visible-light images of the surface taken from space</a>, researchers report in the Feb. 16 <em>Geophysical Research Letters</em>.</p>



<p>“We&#8217;ve never actually seen the surface through the clouds at these wavelengths before,” said Lori Glaze, Director of NASA&#8217;s Planetary Science Division, on February 10 during a live broadcast on Twitter.</p>



<p>Though the Parker Solar Probe was built to study the sun, it must make regular flybys of Venus. The planet’s gravity tugs on the probe, tightening its orbit and <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/nasa-parker-solar-probe-sun-next-close-pass-esa-orbiter">bringing it closer to the sun</a> (<em>SN: 1/15/21</em>). Those assists from Venus helped the spacecraft make headlines when it became the first probe <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/parker-solar-probe-sun-atmosphere-first-spacecraft">to enter the sun’s atmosphere</a> (<em>SN: 12/15/21</em>).</p>

</div><figcaption>The Parker Solar Probe travels around the sun in a highly elliptical orbit, as illustrated in this video. To tighten its loops and bring it nearer to the blazing star, the probe slows itself down by flying near Venus, using the planet’s gravity as a brake.</figcaption></figure>



<p>It was during two such flybys in July 2020 and February 2021 that the probe’s WISPR telescopes captured the new images. While WISPR found Venus’ dayside too bright to image, it was able to discern large-scale surface features, such as the vast highland region called Aphrodite Terra, through the clouds on the nightside.</p>





<p>Clouds tend to scatter and absorb light. But some wavelengths of light get through, depending on the clouds’ chemical makeup, says Paul Byrne, a planetary scientist at Washington University in St. Louis who was not involved in the study.</p>



<p>Though scientists knew such spectral windows exist in Venus’ thick clouds of sulfuric acid, the researchers didn’t expect light visible to human eyes would break through so intensely. And while WISPR was designed to study the sun’s atmosphere, its construction also happens to allow it to detect this unanticipated window of light in Venus’ clouds. “It’s fortuitous that they happened to have an instrument that could see through the clouds,” Byrne says.</p>

<p>The photographs show a planet so hot that it glows, much like red-hot iron, said Brian Wood, an astrophysicist at the U.S. Naval Research Laboratory in Washington, D.C., and a coauthor of the paper, during the social media event.</p>



<p>“The pattern of bright and dark that you see is basically a temperature map,” he said — brighter regions are hotter and darker regions are cooler. This pattern correlates well with topographic maps previously produced from radar and infrared surveys. Highlands appear dark and lowlands appear bright, Wood said.</p>



<p>The images come as NASA prepares to launch <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/nasa-venus-mission-davinci-veritas-space-planetary-science">two missions</a> to Venus (<em>SN: 6/2/21</em>). The new photographs, Wood said, “may help in the interpretation of the observations taken in the future from these new missions.”</p>

<p>Venus’ perpetually cloud-shrouded surface remains penetrable only by radio waves. A planetary radar group now reports results of an extended series of radar measurements of the topography of Venus that for the first time provides a view of surface height variations around the entire circumference of the planet.</p>



<h4>Update</h4>



<p><br>Those observations were taken by the Arecibo radio telescope in Puerto Rico, which was the most powerful radar system for mapping rocky bodies in outer space until its <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/arecibo-telescope-collapse-astronomy-discoveries">sudden collapse</a> in December 2020 (<em>SN: 12/19/20&nbsp;&amp; 1/2/21, p.&nbsp;8</em>). The observatory also revealed <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/radar-image-venus-hints-tectonism/">ancient lava flows</a> on Venus and <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/icy-clues-gleaned-mercurys-other-half">ice on Mercury</a> (<em>SN:&nbsp;9/18/76, p.&nbsp;181</em>; <em>SN: 11/9/91, p.&nbsp;295</em>). Arecibo’s maps of Mars and the asteroid Bennu helped NASA plan the <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/mars-landing-message-puerto-rico">Viking</a> and <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/nasa-osiris-rex-spacecraft-asteroid-bennu-sample-collection">OSIRIS-REx missions</a>. Some other facilities have planetary radar systems, but they are not as powerful as Arecibo’s was. Astronomers are adding a radar transmitter to West&nbsp;Virginia’s Green Bank Telescope that is expected to rival or exceed Arecibo’s.</p>

                <p><em>By</em> <a href="https://emmayoung.net/">Emma Young</a></p>



<p>How similar do you think humans are to other animals? The answer might reveal more than you think: according to <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/01461672211063260">new research</a>, people who perceive themselves as being <em>more</em> similar to other animals are more likely to care about being creative, and to engage with the arts. Why? It’s all to do with how we manage death anxiety, argue Uri Lifshin at Reichman University, Israel, and colleagues, in <em>Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin</em>.</p>



<span id="more-45348"></span>



<p>We all know that at some point, sooner or later, we are going to die. It’s not exactly an uplifting thought. According to Terror Management Theory, to assuage death anxiety, we created cultural belief systems that allow us to see ourselves as more than mortal animals. Belief in an afterlife and a strong identification with one’s national culture are two such systems. But there are also other ways to get a sense of immortality: by becoming famous, say, or via creative pursuits, which might leave a lasting mark.</p>



<p>To explore individual differences in feeling that people are more than mortal animals, the team used a four-item &#8220;perceived similarity of the self to animals&#8221; (PSSA) scale. (Participants had to rate &#8220;how similar you think you are to other animals&#8221;, for example.) And in an initial study on almost 900 American students, they found a correlation between higher PSSA scores and scores on other measures, including being less invested in national identity and feeling that &#8220;being creative&#8221; was important. Another study on a broader range of American adults found a link between higher PSSA scores and greater engagement with and enjoyment of the arts.</p>



<p>In a subsequent online experiment on 189 Jewish Israeli participants, one group was asked to reflect on their own death, while a control group was asked to think about experiences of physical pain instead. The researchers found that among those with relatively high PSSA scores, those who got the death reminder reported caring more about being creative (about &#8220;thinking outside the box&#8221;, for example) than those in the control group. They interpret this as supporting the idea that people who think they are more similar to other animals are more motivated to use creativity as a way to manage their death anxiety. I have to note, though, that within the control group, people with low PSSA scores actually reported caring more about creativity than those with higher PSSA scores — contrary to the team’s expectations. And indeed, other results from some further studies were mixed, too. </p>



<p>The researchers maintain that data from their total of six studies support the idea that seeing ourselves as similar to other animals is directly linked with death anxiety and the pursuit of creativity. This link can’t be explained by other variables including religiosity, personality factors, belief in human evolution and political orientation.</p>



<p>However, statistical trends and marginally significant results do feature pretty heavily in their paper. And in one study, people with higher PSSA scores also scored higher on the personality trait of Openness. <a href="https://scottbarrykaufman.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/Kaufman-2013.pdf">More open people are more interested in the arts (among other things), more creative and less conventional</a> — so less likely to adopt a nationalistic or religious belief system. Are high PSSA scores just tapping into Openness, then?</p>



<p>The team thinks that people’s perceived similarity to animals is important in and of itself. “Our findings suggest that PSSA may be an important factor in understanding investment in creativity,” they write. But while it’s an interesting idea, it’s also one that certainly needs more work.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/gene-therapy-sickle-cell-disease-esrick-genetics">Gene therapies for sickle cell disease come with hope and challenges</a></h4>

              
                <p>Today, it’s clear that our genes not only cause many diseases, but also hold potential cures. But that wasn’t always the case. It wasn’t until 1949 that scientists first found the molecular culprit of a disease — its roots in the genetic code. The disease was the blood disorder known as sickle cell disease, an inherited disorder that causes severe and debilitating pain. Now, nearly 75 years later, researchers are developing gene therapies to cure it.</p>



<p>Sickle cell disease results from<a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/science-fields-1044"> a change in a key protein in hemoglobin</a>, which helps transport oxygen in red blood cells. Hemoglobin normally allows “red blood cells to be very floppy and pliable, and slip and slide through the blood vessels easily,” says pediatrician Erica Esrick. But a mutation in a single gene, the <em>HBB </em>gene, makes hemoglobin stack in long strings inside blood cells, giving them an inflexible, sickle shape. Instead of being “squishy,” the stiff red blood cells get stuck inside blood vessels, blocking blood flow.</p>



<p>Sickle cell affects millions of people around the world, particularly those whose ancestors come from sub-Saharan Africa, parts of the Middle East and Southeast Asia. In the United States, for instance, <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/ncbddd/sicklecell/data.html">approximately 100,000 people live with the disease</a>, most of them Black or Latino. People with sickle cell disease have a shortened life expectancy, living only into their late 40s on average, in large part due to strokes or organ damage from blocked blood vessels. Esrick, of Boston Children’s Hospital and Harvard Medical School, and others are trying to fight the disease through gene therapy.</p>

<p>Gene therapies seek to manipulate the very information of life by replacing, inactivating or fixing missing or broken genes — and so curing patients. But the journey to today’s handful of approved gene therapies, including for diseases like severe combined immunodeficiency syndrome, or SCID, certain blood <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/car-t-cell-gene-therapy-top-science-stories-2017-yir">cancers</a> and spinal muscular atrophy, has been rocky. <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/first-human-gene-therapy-test-begun">Early clinical trials</a> in the 1990s weren’t effective, and the 2000s brought unintended and sometimes deadly consequences, including a leukemia-like illness.</p>



<p>Despite gene therapy’s challenges, many researchers believe sickle cell is a good target because the molecular pathways are well understood and straightforward. What’s more, every copy of the gene doesn’t need to be mended to have an effect. (Individuals who inherit the mutated gene from only one parent, for example, don’t develop sickle cell disease.)</p>



<p>Esrick is co-leading a clinical trial testing a gene therapy that attempts to encourage the body to make more of a healthy type of hemoglobin produced by fetuses and young babies — but not adults — called fetal hemoglobin. DNA for making a short string of genetic material called a microRNA is delivered by a virus into cells from a patient’s bone marrow. The virus, called a vector, permanently inserts the DNA into the cell’s genetic blueprint. The microRNA then interferes with the production of a protein that prevents fetal hemoglobin from being made. Once that protein is blocked, fetal hemoglobin production turns back on. Like turning on a faucet, a steady stream of the healthy hemoglobin can flow into the bloodstream, making up for the faulty form.</p>



<p>Preliminary data released in January 2021 showed that the treatment helped <a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/10.1056/NEJMoa2029392?url_ver=Z39.88-2003">six sickle cell patients make fetal hemoglobin</a>, Esrick and colleagues reported in the <em>New England Journal of Medicine</em>. During the follow-up period, ranging from several months to more than two years, the patients’ symptoms were reduced or eliminated. The team has expanded the trial to include more patients and further test the treatment.</p>

<p>Scientists are testing other ways to tackle sickle cell via gene therapy, too. A biotechnology company called bluebird bio is testing an approach that delivers a functional copy of the <em>HBB </em>gene to patients. Another team is preparing to begin a trial that will edit that gene directly using CRISPR/Cas9.</p>



<p><em>Science News</em> staff writer <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/author/erin-garcia-de-jesus">Erin Garcia de Jesús</a> spoke with Esrick about the ongoing fetal hemoglobin clinical trial, including the hurdles and the hope. The conversation has been edited for length and clarity.</p>



<p><strong>Garcia de Jesús: What tools do we currently have to treat sickle cell?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Esrick</strong>: The only curative treatment is a bone marrow transplant. The bone marrow is like the factory for the blood cells. If you can get bone marrow from somebody who doesn’t have sickle cell disease, then you can grow your own healthy red blood cells that don’t sickle. But that is a major procedure, and it’s really only standard if you have what’s called a matched sibling [a brother or sister without sickle cell whose key white blood cell proteins match yours].</p>



<p>Less than 20 percent of people with sickle cell have a matched sibling available. If a matched sibling is available, then that’s a really good potential treatment option, but it is still a risky procedure. It comes along with some up-front risk of mortality and a lot of potential side effects, such as graft-versus-host disease and a higher risk of infection because of immunosuppressive drugs.</p>



<p>Then there are medications to treat sickle cell. The <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/drug-wards-sickle-cell-attacks">most well-established and long-lasting is called hydroxyurea</a>. It increases fetal hemoglobin. In many people, it increases the fetal hemoglobin by a lot; that&#8217;s why it works so well. It’s been available since the ’90s, and has been moving gradually to younger and younger ages.</p>



<p>Now it is a very clear recommendation that essentially every child with sickle cell should be on it. But not everyone has access to specialized hematology care, and it’s a medication that has to be taken daily. Some people have adverse effects and can’t take it. It also doesn’t work for everybody.</p>

<p><strong>Garcia de Jesús: How many people are in your team’s trial and what results have you seen so far?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Esrick</strong>: Nine patients have been treated. We anticipate the 10th patient will be treated soon. The preliminary data from the first six patients was published about a year ago. Additional data from subsequent patients has been largely quite similar — except for one patient whose fetal hemoglobin response was unfortunately not as robust.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Garcia de Jesús: What is the process like for the trial participants?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Esrick</strong>: Patients have to get their cells collected [the cells live in the bone marrow and give rise to blood cells], which takes a three-day hospital admission and sometimes has to be repeated a few times. It&#8217;s through IV, basically. Then the cells get taken off to the lab.</p>



<p>When we get word from the lab, “OK, we have a good product” [meaning the virus got the DNA into enough cells], then the patient comes back and is admitted to the hospital for a month or so. It&#8217;s a long and arduous hospital admission because they need to receive chemotherapy.</p>



<p>The reason they need chemotherapy is because the bone marrow cells that haven&#8217;t been collected need to get nearly wiped out in order to give the advantage to the cells that are being given back [also through IV] to set up shop and produce.</p>



<p>Chemotherapy comes with a lot of the side effects and risks associated with gene therapy, including acute short-term risks like hearing loss and nausea. And it also comes with some of the long-term risks, including infertility and a risk of blood cancers.</p>



<p><strong>Garcia de Jesús: Why choose gene therapy over a bone marrow transplant if both require chemotherapy?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Esrick</strong>: With gene therapy, there&#8217;s no issue with immunosuppression, because it&#8217;s your own cells. People who get a transplant from another person have to be on immunosuppressive medications for a period of months after the transplant. There&#8217;s a risk of graft rejection because of the mismatch between the donor and the recipient.</p>



<p>The other risk in a bone marrow transplant from another person is graft-versus-host disease, where the graft and donated cells reject the recipient. That can cause severe disease. With gene therapy, that&#8217;s not a risk at all.</p>



<p><strong>Garcia de Jesús: Last year, a clinical trial run by a company called bluebird bio announced that a trial participant developed leukemia. Cancer is obviously a huge concern and has thwarted previous gene therapy trials. What do we know so far about that?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Esrick</strong>: This was, of course, of major concern to the field. It was actually the second case of leukemia in that trial. The first one was published a couple of years ago as a case report.</p>



<p>If there&#8217;s ever a case of leukemia or any preleukemia in a gene therapy trial, we always ask: Was it caused because the vector stuck a gene into a spot that was dangerous?</p>



<p>It does not look like that&#8217;s the case. In the first patient in the bluebird bio trial who developed leukemia, the leukemia cells didn&#8217;t even have the transferred gene in them. So, the thought was that was probably just an example of chemotherapy causing leukemia, which we know can happen in a small percent of people who receive chemotherapy.</p>



<p>But the second case, in February 2021, really raised a red flag. Why is that happening two times in a trial of only 40-something patients? It&#8217;s still not exactly clear. There are some studies that suggest that people with sickle cell disease may have an increased risk of leukemia. But the [U.S. Food and Drug Administration] placed the bluebird bio trial on hold while some investigations were done. When it became pretty clear that it wasn&#8217;t directly related to the vector, the trial was allowed to reopen.</p>



<p>Our trial, which has many similarities to the bluebird bio trial, was not put on hold by the FDA but was put on hold by our funder, the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute while they looked at the data. That hold was recently lifted.</p>





<p><strong>Garcia de Jesús: Have there been any cases of leukemia in your team’s trial?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Esrick</strong>: Fortunately, no.</p>



<p>But you know when anything like that happens in the field, it&#8217;s a big deal. I called all of the patients who we had treated in our trial to let them know. [The bluebird bio cases] happened in patients who had been treated three and five years prior. The longest-treated patient in our trial was almost three and a half years ago, and the most recently treated was about eight or nine months ago. I hope we see no concerning signs for any new development like that, but it&#8217;s too early to say.</p>



<p><strong>Garcia de Jesús: What are some of the biggest challenges that sickle cell has had to overcome?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Esrick</strong>: For the longest time, there were no new therapies at all. These technologies took a long time because they are based on basic science discoveries that were being worked on. But also, the patient population with sickle cell is a population that has historically been underserved and without a lot of power.</p>



<p>In the United States, it’s primarily Black and Latino patients, and across the board those populations have suffered from health inequality. I think that if there were a disease that caused this degree of morbidity and mortality and pain in other parts of the population, it may have been speedier.</p>



<p><strong>Garcia de Jesús: What gives you hope? What do you find exciting?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Esrick</strong>: I find myself bending over backwards to make sure that I’m not coming across as, “We have a cure!” But that said, it is really exciting that this is a treatment that is theoretically possible for everyone without needing to find a [bone marrow] match. That’s a huge difference from classic bone marrow transplants.</p>



<p>The speed at which new [gene therapy] treatments are being developed is amazing. I think the horizon is very bright in terms of one or maybe many of these therapies being really effective and safe. I’ve talked to so many patients and families who have reached out interested in our trial or other trials. There’s such a huge unmet need. The fact that there are a lot of these new treatments that are being developed is an encouragement to these families.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://gcamp6f.com/2022/02/11/public-peer-review-files/">Public peer review files</a></h4>

              
                <p>Peer-review is probably the most obscure part of the publication of scientific results. In this blog post, I would like to make the point that the best way to learn about it &#8211; except by being directly involved &#8211; is to read public peer review files. In addition, I will recommend some interesting or surprising peer review files, mostly for systems neuroscience, but also for some optics papers.</p>



<p><strong>Public peer review files should be the standard</strong></p>



<p>Peer review takes place before official &#8220;publication&#8221; in a peer-reviewed journal and is therefore usually not accessible to the reader. During the last years, this practice has changed, and more and more journals are now offering the peer review and rebuttal letters as supplementary files. This is done for example by the journal eLife, but also Nature Communications, sometimes for the SfN journals, and Nature. For some journals, like Nature, the authors can opt out of the peer review file publication (<a href="https://www.nature.com/documents/nr-transparent-peer-review.pdf">here is Nature&#8217;s policy</a>). But, honestly, if you are not willing to share the reviews publicly, what do you want to hide? I think it should become a mandatory standard to share the reviews, with only specific reasons justifying an opt-out.</p>



<p><strong>What to learn from peer review files</strong></p>



<p>As a young researcher like a PhD student, it is rare to be involved in the review process, which, therefore, remains a black box. For me, it was fascinating to read my first peer review files on eLife maybe 5 years ago. It felt like the entire smooth surface of this paper started to crumble and give way to a more rich and more nuanced point of view. Looking back at this paper, this nuanced view was also somewhat included in the paper, but in such a smooth manner that it was difficult to extract without absolute expert knowledge.</p>



<p>Nowadays, I rarely read eLife papers until also the peer review section is online (which comes a couple days after the preliminary pdf). The reviewer comments provide an additional point of view that is very helpful in particular when I cannot fully judge the paper myself.</p>



<p>Additionally, reading such review files helps to write both better manuscripts, better rebuttal letters, and also better reviews. Also, gaining experience from these files prepares a bit for the sometimes very difficult experiences when receiving the reviews. Plus, reading those reviews makes the entire process a bit more transparent. When I wrote my first reviews for journals, I had seen only three or four reviews for my own co-author papers; but I had seen many more as public review files.</p>



<p>Let&#8217;s look into some examples that show what can happen during peer review. Paper links are in the title, links to the review files/sections thereafter.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-021-04268-7"><strong>Toroidal topology of grid cell acti</strong></a><strong><a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-021-04268-7">vity</a> (<a href="https://static-content.springer.com/esm/art%3A10.1038%2Fs41586-021-04268-7/MediaObjects/41586_2021_4268_MOESM4_ESM.pdf">Review file</a>)</strong></p>



<p>When the <a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.02.25.432776v1">preprint</a> of this paper by Gardner et al. from the Moser lab appeared, I put it on my reading list, but never actually read it fully because I did not feel on top of the vast literature about continuous attractor models, and I did not even know whether a &#8220;toroidal&#8221; geometry of the activity space would be a surprising result or not.</p>



<p>Checking the peer review files after publication at Nature provided exactly this entry point that I had been missing before. In retrospect, all the information needed is also in the paper, but the more direct and less formal language in the reviews took me by the hand and showed me directly what the paper is about. The summaries at the beginning of each review provide a very useful second perspective on the main messages of the paper.</p>

<p>A few weeks ago, I noticed an interesting article published at Nature on &#8220;deep physical neural networks&#8221;. I checked the author&#8217;s <a href="https://mobile.twitter.com/LoganGWright1/status/1488885395827871747">Twitter thread</a> on the paper and found the topic intriguing, but slightly beyond my area of expertise. The review file provided me exactly with the lacking context and critical external opinion that I needed to form a somewhat less vague opinion of the specific advance made by the paper. Really helpful!</p>

<p>This review file contains an entire story by itself. In the first round of review, reviewer #1 was rather critical, while the other two reviewers were almost convinced already. The authors, in a 8-month revision period finally managed to very decently address most points brought up by the reviewers. They do this, as has become apparently common practice for rebuttal letters to high-impact journals, in a very long and detailed letter (the entire review file is 44 pages).</p>



<p>But after this round of reviews and rebuttals, suddenly, reviewer #3 changes his/her opinion entirely:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>&#8220;Unfortunately my evaluation of this paper has changed since the first submission due to comments from the other reviewers and because of literature I have discovered since then. This paper presents a set of reasonably well performed and analyzed experiments, but I no longer think the main results are novel or surprising. I therefore do not recommend publication in Nature and think this paper is better suited for a specialist journal.&#8221;</p></blockquote>



<p>This is just the beginning of a long comment on why the reviewer thinks the paper is not novel enough any more. This is of course a nightmare for the authors. In the end, the authors do their best to address these concerns of novelty. Reviewer #3 remains unconvinced. The editor decides to ignore these concerns and goes with the recommendation of the other reviewers to publish the manuscript. Check it out yourself to form your own opinion on this discussion!</p>

<p>A much wilder story is hidden in the peer review file of this optics paper from Tom Baden&#8217;s lab, which was finally published at Nature Communications. The first set of reviews at Nat Comm is still pretty normal, but then something goes wrong. Reviewer #4, who is &#8211; very obviously &#8211; highly competent but also a bit obsessed with details and annoyed by imprecision, has a few things to complain about, mostly about a few relatively small unsubstantiated claims and some minor errors that do not affect the main idea of the manuscript. However, the authors do not agree with this opinion, and a long and slowly escalating discussion between an annoyed reviewer and frustrated authors evolves. Check it out yourself. If you don&#8217;t get stomach pain while reading, you have my full admiration. At some point, reviewer #4 writes:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>&#8220;In the last round of review, I wrote detailed comments, color-rebuttal, in a 16-page PDF, with the hope that they would be of help to the authors to make the manuscript better. The response I received on this round, surprisingly, is only 5 pages, and the authors reluctantly chose, on purpose or randomly, 5 comments to address, and ignored all other comments I curated. PLEASE RE-WRITE your response by addressing all comments I gave last time.&#8221;</p></blockquote>



<p>Upon &#8220;editorial guidance&#8221;, the authors refrain from doing so. It all ends with mutual passive aggression (&#8220;No further comment&#8221; from both sides) &#8211; and acceptance for publication as an article.</p>



<p>Read it yourself to see how crazy and tiring peer review can be, and consider yourself how this situation could have been avoided by the authors or the reviewers. However, in the end, this review file is also a contribution to the scientific discussion (e.g., about proper PSF measurements) and therefore valuable by itself. It is a painful document, but also useful and full of insights.</p>

<p>Three-photon microscopy is a relatively new field still, and when these two papers came out in Nature Communications and eLife, respectively, I was very happy to be provided with the additional context and details in the peer review files. I found especially the discussion in the Nat Comm paper (paper 1) about potential concerns for three-photon imaging very interesting. </p>

<p>A few years ago, I had covered a preprint by Francioni et al. from the Rochefort lab <a href="https://gcamp6f.com/2019/07/10/post-publication-review-somato-dendritic-coupling-of-l5-neurons-in-v1/">on my blog</a>. This study was later published on eLife, and since I liked the work of this paper already, I was very curious about the comments of the reviewers, their concerns, and the author&#8217;s replies. It is nice to get additional insights into such interesting studies!</p>

<p>The review file of this beautiful methods paper from the Burgalossi lab tells an interesting story. Apparently, the authors had included an additional experimental sub-study based on cfos in the paper, but the reviewers were not convinced by the results. They therefore suggested &#8211; very surprising to me! &#8211;  the acceptance of the paper for publication, but only after deletion of this subsection. I would not have guessed that such a unexpected and helpful consensus can be reached during the review process. This was probably helped by the fact that at eLife, it is common practice that editors and reviewers discuss their reviews with one another.</p>

<p>Purely theoretical (neuroscience) papers are often challenging because it is difficult to fully judge the novelty, even whenthe concepts and ideas and equations are transparent. This paper by Wu and Zenke is conceptually close to what I have studied experimentally during my PhD (<a href="https://www.cell.com/neuron/fulltext/S0896-6273(18)30786-4">paper link</a> in case you&#8217;re interested), so I was happy that this paper got published at eLife, with the review publicly available. A very useful secondary perspective!</p>

<p>This is &#8211; so far &#8211; the only paper with public review file where I have been involved as an author. I wrote some sections of the rebuttal letter, actually without knowing that the reviews and rebuttals would be openly available afterwards. Unfortunately, the journal (eNeuro) messed up the formatting in such a horrible way that the review file becomes almost unreadable (which is a pity, because our rebuttal letter was very nicely written). This mess-up shows that there is still some progress to make, also in terms of infrastructure.</p>



<p>In general, I hope that public review files will become more common in the future, to the extent that non-public review files will be a thing of the past entirely. Public reviews make the editorial process more transparent, they open up the discussion behind the paper, lower the barriers for junior researchers with less peer review experience, and do not have, to my understanding, any major negative side-effects.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/starfish-skeleton-structure-diamond-strength-calcite">A diamondlike structure gives some starfish skeletons their strength</a></h4>

              
                <p>Some starfish made of a brittle material fortify themselves with architectural antics.</p>



<p>Beneath a starfish’s skin lies a skeleton made of pebbly growths, called ossicles, which mostly consist of the mineral calcite. Calcite is usually fragile, and even more so when it is porous. But the hole-riddled ossicles of the knobby starfish (<em>Protoreaster nodosus</em>) <a href="http://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.abj9472">are strengthened through an unexpected internal arrangement</a>, researchers report in the Feb. 11 <em>Science</em>.</p>



<p>“When we first saw the structure, we were really amazed,” says Ling Li, a materials scientist at Virginia Tech in Blacksburg. It looks like it’s been 3-D printed, he says.</p>



<p>Li and colleagues used an electron microscope to zoom in on ossicles from several dozen dead knobby starfish. At a scale of 50 micrometers, about half the width of a human hair, the seemingly featureless body of each ossicle gives way to a meshlike pattern that mirrors how carbon atoms are arranged in a diamond.</p>

<p>But the diamondlike lattice alone doesn’t fully explain how the ossicles stay strong.</p>



<p>Within that lattice, the atoms that make up the calcite have their own pattern, which resembles a series of stacked hexagons. That pattern affects the strength of the calcite too. In general, a mineral’s strength isn’t uniform in all directions. So pushing on calcite in some directions is more likely to break it than force from other directions. In the ossicles, the atomic pattern and the diamondlike lattice align in a way that compensates for calcite’s intrinsic weakness<em>.</em></p>



<p>It’s a mystery how the animals make the diamondlike lattice. Li’s team is studying live knobby starfish, surveying the chemistry of how ossicles form. Understanding how the starfish build their ossicles may provide insights for creating stronger porous materials, including some ceramics.</p>



<p>We can learn a lot from a creature like a starfish that we may think is primitive, Li says.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/omicron-delta-coronavirus-covid-variant-spread-speed">Omicron crushed delta in the U.S. These numbers show just how fast it happened</a></h4>

              
                <p>If it felt like omicron exploded with mind-boggling speed, a new look at the numbers backs that up. The highly contagious coronavirus variant achieved dominance in the United States in <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/71/wr/mm7106a4.htm?s_cid=mm7106a4_w">a record-breaking two weeks</a>; in comparison, it took the delta variant eight weeks to hit that milestone, researchers report in the Feb. 11 <em>Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report</em>.</p>



<p>Delta began <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coronavirus-covid-delta-variant-transmission-vaccines">its climb to domination</a> amid a smorgasbord of variants circulating in the United States in early 2021 (<em>SN: 7/2/21</em>). At the beginning of May, delta was responsible for a mere 1 percent of new weekly infections. Eight weeks later, the week ending June 26, delta drove more than half of new infections. And by the end of July, the variant accounted for more than 95 percent of new COVID-19 cases each week.</p>

<p>Omicron, on the other hand, is estimated to have accomplished the same feat four times faster. U.S. public health officials documented the first omicron case on December 1, 2021. By the week ending December 11, the variant accounted for more than 1 percent of new cases. Only two weeks later, that number rocketed to more than 50 percent — then rose to more than 95 percent the week ending January 8.</p>





<p>The omicron variant’s rapid spread was likely driven by increased transmissibility over delta, as well as a <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/omicron-coronavirus-covid-variant-severity-antibodies">better ability to evade parts of the immune system</a>, the researchers say (<em>SN: 12/21/21</em>). Recent estimates from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention suggest that <a href="https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#variant-proportions">omicron may have extinguished the delta variant’s spread</a> in the United States by February 5, though it’s possible that the analysis wasn’t broad enough to catch any lurking delta variants. The numbers can also change over time as officials analyze more data.</p>

<h3>Competing coronaviruses</h3>



<p>Many different variants were circulating in the United States in early 2021 (colored by variant). Delta (orange), which made up a tiny fraction of cases in the spring, took over during the summer only to be rapidly displaced by omicron (purple) at the end of the year. To estimate the variants&#8217; prevalence, public health officials analyze the genetic material from a subset of coronavirus infections across the United States.</p>

<p>The fifteen world-class research libraries of the Big Ten Academic Alliance (BTAA) have agreed to support arXiv, a community-supported resource administered by Cornell University, at the champion level for the next three years.</p>
<p>arXiv is an open access research-sharing platform that currently hosts more than two million scholarly articles in eight major fields, including physics, mathematics, and computer science. Beyond content curation and preservation, arXiv provides researchers with a variety of services including the submission of articles, compilation, production, retrieval, search and discovery, web distribution for human readers, and API access for machines.</p>
<p>Maurice York, Director, Library Initiatives at the Big Ten Academic Alliance stated, “We are delighted to be able to strengthen academic infrastructure by supporting the good work of arXiv by making a multi-year commitment at the highest level. We view this move as an integral part of continuing to build toward an open scholarly ecosystem and advance the goals of the BTAA <a href="https://btaa.org/library/big-collection/the-big-collection-introduction">Big Collection</a>”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/dinosaur-lung-infection-fossils-oldest-case">Fossils reveal what may be the oldest known case of the dino sniffles</a></h4>

              
                <p>The prehistoric world wasn&#8217;t a paradise free of disease, but diagnosing ancient ailments is tricky: Germs usually don’t fossilize well. Now, though, researchers have unearthed evidence of what appears to be the oldest known respiratory infection in a dinosaur.</p>



<p>Lesions found in the vertebrae of a 150-million-year-old juvenile sauropod dubbed “Dolly” point to <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-022-05761-3">a lung infection that moved into her bones</a>, vertebrate paleontologist Cary Woodruff and colleagues report February 10 in <em>Scientific Reports</em>. That’s at least 50 million years older than <a href="https://ojs.uv.es/index.php/sjpalaeontology/article/view/20305/0">the previously reported respiratory infection in a titanosaur</a> unearthed in Brazil.</p>



<p>Dolly, a long-necked dinosaur, was probably closely related to <em>Diplodocus</em>. At the time of her death in what’s now southwestern Montana, she was about 18 meters long and less than 20 years old, Woodruff estimates.</p>



<p>The fossils that the team analyzed include the dinosaur’s skull and the first seven neck vertebrae, which contained air sacs connected to the lungs and other parts of the respiratory system. The bones of many of today’s birds, which are modern-day dinosaurs, have similar features.&nbsp;</p>





<p>On the fifth through seventh vertebrae, the fossils have bone lesions at spots where the air sacs would have intruded into the bone, the team found. The oddly shaped and textured bumps protrude from the bone as much as 1 centimeter, says Woodruff, of the Great Plains Dinosaur Museum in Malta, Mont.</p>

<p>So many lesions turning up in similar spots are unlikely to be bone tumors, which in birds are rather uncommon anyway, Woodruff notes. Instead, the lesions formed in response to a respiratory infection that spread to the distant air sacs, the team proposes.</p>



<p>Though Dolly’s bone lesions wouldn’t have been obvious to an ancient observer, she likely had a fever, cough, labored breathing and nasal discharge, the scientists suggest.</p>



<p>It’s not clear whether the infection was bacterial, viral or fungal, or whether it is what killed Dolly. But the researchers note that many birds and reptiles today can suffer from a respiratory infection caused by the fungus <em>Aspergillus </em>that can in turn lead to bone infections.</p>





<p>For an infection in the neck vertebrae’s air sacs to cause bony lesions, “you’re looking at a chronic condition,” says Cynthia Faux, a veterinarian at the University of Arizona in Tucson with a degree in vertebrate paleontology who was not involved in the study.</p>



<p>Diseases such as <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/turn-your-head-and-roar">arthritis and gout as well as other infections</a> have been reported previously in dinosaurs and other ancient creatures (<em>SN: 12/11/01</em>). And while Dolly’s respiratory infection seems to be the oldest known for a dinosaur, it’s nowhere near the record. In 2018, researchers described a tuberculosis-like infection in a marine reptile that lived about 245 million years ago.</p>

                <p><em>By</em> <a href="https://emmayoung.net/">Emma Young</a></p>



<p>It’s tricky to investigate fear. An ethics panel would frown on shooting at people (even with pellet guns), or exposing them to simulated suffocation — or drowning. Though we know that scary situations trigger physiological arousal so that we can fight or flee, ethical and practical concerns have made it hard to get at just how that plays out in the real world. Enter a team from the California Institute of Technology, who left the lab in favour of an <a href="https://the17thdoor.com/about/">immersive scary prison attraction</a> in nearby Orange County.</p>



<span id="more-45330"></span>



<p>Each of the 17 rooms of the experience feature different threats. These include suffocation, moving floors, being blindfolded in front of a firing squad (armed with pellet guns) and electric shocks. As Sarah M. Tashjian and her colleagues note in <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/09567976211032231">their paper</a> in <em>Psychological Science</em>, “Many threats were more threatening and/or pain inducing than is ethically allowed in campus laboratory in the United States.” The participants were 156 customers, who were recruited after paying for their entry and being assigned to a guided group of 8-10 people.</p>



<p>After reporting on how many friends vs strangers were in their group, they completed a questionnaire that asked, among other things, about how much fear they were feeling, and expected to feel once inside. Next, they were fitted with a wrist-worn wireless sensor that monitored their skin conductance, which indicated how much they were sweating (more sweating indicates greater physiological arousal). Then off they went for a half-hour tour through &#8220;Perpetuum Penitentiary&#8221;, home to murderers and &#8220;vile and sadistic engineers&#8221; set on treating &#8220;the evils of humanity&#8221;… At the end, they reported on how much fear they’d actually felt.</p>



<p>The fear questionnaires produced some interesting results. Women reported expecting to feel more fear inside than men did, and also afterwards reported having felt more fear. Overall, though, both genders expected to feel more fear than they actually felt. The team also found that people who reported feeling more scared inside had experienced more frequent skin conductance &#8220;bursts&#8221;. This suggests that how scary you find an experience is a feature of the number of arousal &#8220;spikes&#8221; you experience. The team also notes that, perhaps unsurprisingly, unexpected sudden scares triggered bigger leaps in arousal than scares that the participants could anticipate.</p>



<p>One of the aims of the study was also to explore how the presence of friends and strangers influences the fear response. After all, when we face a threat in the real world, we’re often in the company of at least one other person. But the evidence in this area has been conflicting — some research suggests that the presence of friends buffers us from the effects of unpleasant experiences, while other studies have found that we &#8220;catch&#8221; more fear from friends than strangers.</p>



<p>The team found that people who went through Perpetuum Penitentiary with relatively more friends than strangers had <em>higher</em> background-level arousal throughout the experience. This seems to fit with the idea of emotion contagion, not social buffering. However, the team’s own data showed that more frequent arousal spikes — not higher background arousal — was linked to feeling more scared. Physiological arousal is associated not just with fear, though, but excitement. Perhaps the presence of more friends vs strangers boosted background excitement (rather than fear). But as the participants didn’t report on excitement levels, this is an open question.</p>



<p>There are a few other limitations to the study. One: the participants had all chosen to attend the attraction, no doubt because they expected to enjoy it. Other people might not respond in the same way. Also, Perpetuum Penitentiary was &#8220;safe scary&#8221;; the visitors knew they weren’t really going to be shot or drowned, and <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2020/11/12/not-too-scary-not-too-tame-horror-experiences-need-to-hit-a-sweet-spot-to-be-enjoyable/">recreational horror experiences do need to hit a fear sweet spot between fear and fun to be enjoyable</a>. So there are a few gaps between an experience like this and a real life scary situation.</p>



<p>Still, given all the obstacles to researching fear in the lab, and the scarcity of good data on how we react to scary situations — especially when other people are around — this is really interesting work. It “provides an important proof of concept and guide for field experiments to probe contributors to threat psychology,” the team writes — and it’s hard to argue with that.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/homo-sapiens-humans-europe-migration-earlier-france-rock-shelter">Homo sapiens may have reached Europe 10,000 years earlier than previously thought</a></h4>

              
                <p>Stone Age <em>Homo sapiens</em> began migrating into Europe much longer ago than has typically been assumed.</p>



<p>Discoveries at a rock-shelter in southern France put <em>H. sapiens</em> in Europe as early as 56,800 years ago, a new study finds. That’s around <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/earliest-known-humans-europe-bacho-kiro-bulgaria">10,000 years earlier than previously thought</a> (<em>SN: 5/11/20</em>).</p>



<p>The French site, called Grotte Mandrin, was alternately occupied by the <em>H. sapiens</em> newcomers and Neandertals native to Europe, <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1126/sciadv.abj9496">replacing each other a couple of times</a> before Neandertals died out roughly 40,000 years ago, researchers report February 9 in <em>Science Advances</em>.</p>



<p>The finds from the rock-shelter, situated 225 meters above the middle Rhône River Valley, challenge a popular view that Neandertals died out within a few thousand years of <em>H. sapiens</em> reaching Europe, say archaeologist Ludovic Slimak of the University of Toulouse-Jean Jaurès in France and colleagues.</p>





<p>Slimak has directed excavations at Grotte Mandrin for the last 24 years. Nearly 60,000 stone artifacts and more than 70,000 bones of horses, bison and other animals have been unearthed in 12 sediment layers. Only nine isolated hominid teeth have been found in five of those layers. But these teeth can be categorized as either Neandertal or <em>H. sapiens</em> based on their shapes and sizes, the researchers say. The oldest <em>H. sapiens</em> material in the rock-shelter includes a single tooth from a 2- to 6-year-old child, Slimak says.</p>



<p>Dating of each sediment layer relied on radiocarbon age estimates for excavated bone artifacts and calculations of the time elapsed since each set of finds was buried and certain stones were heated during toolmaking.</p>



<p>Given this evidence, it now appears that <em>H. sapiens</em> groups periodically entered southern Europe long before Neandertals went extinct, says paleoanthropologist Isabelle Crevecoeur of the University of Bordeaux in France, who did not participate in the new study. “The arrival of <em>Homo sapiens</em> in Europe after the demise of Neandertals was probably the end of a long, sometimes unsuccessful, migration process.”</p>



<p><em>H. sapiens</em> who first settled at Grotte Mandrin consisted of several dozen individuals or more, Slimak estimates. Archaeological evidence indicates that, between 56,800 and 51,700 years ago, those ancient people inhabited the site for some 40 years. “This was not a short-term hunter-gatherer camp but a tentative colonization of Europe,” Slimak says.</p>



<p>Resident Neandertals and ancient <em>H. sapiens</em> migrants had at least brief contacts, Slimak says. Flint used by <em>H. sapiens</em> to make tools came from sources located within 100 kilometers of the rock-shelter in all directions, knowledge that could have been acquired only with the help of Neandertals already well-versed in the region’s landscape, Slimak contends.</p>



<p>After <em>H. sapiens’</em> 40-year stay, Neandertals returned to the rock-shelter, where their earliest occupations date as far back as 120,000 years ago, the researchers found. <em>H. sapiens</em> reoccupied the site between about 44,100 and 41,500 years ago — roughly 14,000 years after their initial visit. After that, Neandertals left no signs of having come back.</p>



<p>In an unexpected twist, small stone points and blades made by Grotte Mandrin <em>H. sapiens</em> as many as 56,800 years ago match those previously attributed to <em>H. sapiens</em> at a site in Lebanon dating to around 40,000 years ago. Archaeologists have struggled for over a century to figure out who made the same types of stone tools, dating to about the same time, at several middle Rhône Valley sites, including Grotte Mandrin.</p>



<p>Ancient Middle Easterners whose descendants made tools at the Lebanese site traveled some 3,000 kilometers to reach Grotte Mandrin, likely by navigating vessels of some kind along the Mediterranean coast, Slimak suspects. Their toolmaking tradition was then passed down through many generations by groups living near the rock-shelter, he speculates.</p>



<p>Though no evidence exists of ancient sea trips from the Middle East to what’s now southern France, “it seems that <em>H. sapiens</em> arrived in Europe several times, and we cannot exclude that [they] arrived even earlier than 56,000 years ago,” says paleoanthropologist Stefano Benazzi of the University of Bologna in Italy, who was not part of Slimak’s team.</p>



<p>But the significance of the Grotte Mandrin finds, like <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/human-evolution-mating-2021-research">the evolutionary relationship of <em>H. sapiens</em> to Neandertals</a> (<em>SN: 12/13/21</em>), is controversial. A single <em>H. sapiens</em> tooth deposited between 56,800 and 51,700 years ago can’t conclusively demonstrate that <em>H. sapiens</em> but not Neandertals made tools found in that sediment layer, says evolutionary biologist Clive Finlayson of the Gibraltar National Museum.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/europe-oldest-known-humans-mated-neandertals-dna-fossils">Genetic evidence points to mating between Neandertals and <em>H. sapiens</em></a> (<em>SN: 4/7/21</em>), raising the possibility that hybrid offspring of those populations fashioned stone tools at the French site, Finlayson says.</p>



<p>To confirm the evolutionary identities of Grotte Mandrin’s various Stone Age toolmakers, Slimak’s team is now attempting to extract ancient DNA from hominid teeth and sediment at the site.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/earth-inner-core-superionic-matter-weird-solid-liquid">Weird ‘superionic’ matter could make up Earth’s inner core</a></h4>

              
                <p>A quirky material that behaves like a mishmash of liquid and solid could be hidden deep in the Earth.</p>



<p>Computer simulations described in two studies suggest that the material in Earth’s inner core, which includes iron and other, lighter elements, may be in a “superionic” state. That means that while the iron stays put, as in a solid, the lighter elements flow like a liquid.</p>



<p>The research gives a potential peek at the inner workings of an enigmatic, inaccessible realm of the planet. According to conventional scientific wisdom, Earth’s core consists of a liquid outer core surrounding a <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/earth-core-solidified-just-time-save-magnetic-field">solid inner core</a> (<em>SN: 1/28/19</em>). But beyond knowing that the inner core is rich in iron, scientists don’t know exactly which other elements are present, and in what quantities.</p>



<p>“The inner core is very difficult to scrutinize simply because it’s so deep beneath our feet,” says geophysicist Hrvoje Tkalčić of Australian National University in Canberra.</p>





<p>Seismic waves stirred up by earthquakes can plow through the inner core, providing clues to what’s inside. But measurements of these waves have left researchers puzzled. The velocity of one type of wave, called a shear wave, is lower than expected for solid iron or for many types of iron alloys — mixtures of iron with other materials. “That is a mystery about the inner core,” says geophysicist Yu He of the Chinese Academy of Sciences in Guiyang.</p>



<p>In one new study, He and colleagues simulated a group of 64 iron atoms, along with various types of lighter elements — hydrogen, carbon and oxygen — under pressures and temperatures expected for the inner core. In a normal solid, atoms arrange themselves in an orderly grid, holding fast to their positions. In a superionic material, some of the atoms arrange neatly, as in a solid, while others are liquid-like free spirits that slip right through the solid lattice. In the simulation, the researchers found, the lighter elements moved about while the iron stayed in place.</p>



<p>That superionic status <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-021-04361-x">slowed shear waves</a>, the researchers report February 9 in <em>Nature</em>, suggesting the weird phase of matter could explain the unexpected shear wave velocity measured in the inner core.</p>



<p>Shear waves, also known as secondary or S waves, <a href="https://www.sciencenewsforstudents.org/article/explainer-seismic-waves-come-different-flavors">jiggle the Earth</a> perpendicular to their direction of travel, like the undulations that move along a jump rope that’s wiggled up and down (<em>SNS: 1/12/18</em>). Other waves, called primary or P waves, compress and expand the Earth in a direction parallel to their travel, like an accordion being squeezed.</p>



<p>To really explain the inner core, scientists must find a combination of elements that keeps with everything scientists know about the inner core, including its S wave velocity, P wave velocity and its density. “You have to match all three things, otherwise it doesn’t work,” says mineral physicist John Brodholt of University College London.</p>



<p>In a study published in August 2021 in <em>Earth and Planetary Science Letters</em>, Brodholt and colleagues <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0012821X21002739">did just that</a>. A simulation of iron, silicon and hydrogen atoms reproduced the inner core’s known characteristics. In the simulation, the material was also superionic: The iron and silicon stayed in position while the hydrogen flowed like a liquid.</p>



<p>But Brodholt notes that their result is just one possible explanation for the inner core’s properties. Brodholt and his colleagues have previously found <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0012821X18302085">other combinations of elements that could explain the inner core</a> without going superionic, he says, leaving unresolved the question of what lurks in Earth’s deepest depths.</p>



<p>Another puzzle of Earth’s heart is the fact that the inner core’s structure seems to change over time. This has previously been interpreted as evidence that the inner core rotates at a different rate than the rest of the Earth. But He and colleagues suggest that it could instead result from the motions of liquid-like light elements swirling inside the inner core and changing the distribution of elements over time. “This paper sort of offers an explanation for both of these phenomena” — the slow shear wave velocity and the shifting structure — says Tkalčić, who was not involved with either new study.</p>



<p>One thing missing is laboratory experiments showing how these combinations of elements behave under inner core conditions, says geophysicist Daniele Antonangeli of Sorbonne University in Paris, who was not involved with the new research. Such tests could help confirm whether the simulations are correct.</p>



<p>Previous experiments have found evidence that <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/superionic-ice-liquid-solid-physics">water ice can go superionic</a>, perhaps under conditions found inside Uranus or Neptune (<em>SN: 2/5/18</em>). But researchers can’t yet probe the behavior of superionic materials under the conditions thought to exist inside Earth’s core. So scientists will have to keep pushing the tests to further extremes, Antonangeli says. “The experimentalist that is within me craves seeing experimental validation of this.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/human-genome-project-dna-genetics-revolution-green">How the Human Genome Project revolutionized understanding of our DNA</a></h4>

              
                <p class="has-drop-cap" style="font-size:20px">In October 1990, biologists officially embarked on one of the century’s most ambitious scientific efforts: reading the 3 billion pairs of genetic subunits — the A’s, T’s, C’s and G’s — that make up the human instruction book. </p>



<p>The project promised to blow open our understanding of basic biology, reveal relationships between the myriad forms of life on the planet and transform medicine through insights into genetic diseases and potential cures. When <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/human-genome-work-reaches-milestone">the project was completed in 2003</a>, the scientists having read essentially every letter, President Bill Clinton called it a “stunning and humbling achievement” and predicted it would “revolutionize the diagnosis, prevention and treatment of most, if not all, human diseases.”</p>



<p>Even dreaming up such an endeavor depended on decades of previous discoveries. In 1905, <a href="https://www.britannica.com/biography/William-Bateson">English biologist William Bateson</a>, who championed the work of Austrian monk Gregor Mendel, suggested the term genetics for a new field of study focused on heredity and variation. Early the next decade, American biologist Thomas Hunt Morgan and his colleagues showed that genes are carried on chromosomes. Biochemists had been studying DNA for nearly three-quarters of a century when Oswald Avery and his team at the Rockefeller Institute in New York City helped establish in the 1940s that DNA is the genetic material. And perhaps most notable, and famous today, is <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/way-life-handed">the 1953 discovery of the double-helix structure of DNA</a>, by James Watson and Francis Crick of the University of Cambridge and Rosalind Franklin and Maurice Wilkins of King’s College London.</p>

<p>But when the draft of the genetic instruction book was first published, independently by an international collective of academic and government labs called the Human Genome Project and the private company Celera Genomics, led by J. Craig Venter, the text was “as striking for what we don’t see as for what we do,” <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/newly-sequenced-genome-bares-all"><em>Science News</em> reported</a> (<em>SN: 2/17/01, p. 100</em>). There were many fewer genes than expected, leaving a puzzle about what all the remaining DNA was for.</p>



<p>In the decades since, scientists have filled in some of that puzzle — identifying a host of genes, for example, that don’t make proteins but are still essential in the body. Other researchers have searched the instruction book to find new treatments for diseases and to figure out how we’re all related — not just people, but all life on planet Earth, past and present.</p>



<p>To explore how far our understanding of our DNA has come, <em>Science News</em> senior writer and molecular biology reporter <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/author/tina-hesman-saey">Tina Hesman Saey</a> talked with <a href="https://www.genome.gov/staff/Eric-D-Green-MD-PhD">Eric Green</a>, director of the National Human Genome Research Institute at the National Institutes of Health in Bethesda, Md. Green got his start in genomics in the lab of Maynard Olson at Washington University in St. Louis, a pioneer in the field. At the same time, Saey was a graduate student in molecular genetics, working down the hall. She remembers as an undergraduate student sequencing the genes of bacteria 50 to 100 chemical subunits, or bases, at a time. “My mind was completely blown by the idea that you could put together 3 billion bases.” The conversation that follows, which has been edited for length and clarity, looks back on the project and ahead to all that’s left to learn. <em>— Elizabeth Quill</em></p>

<h4>Ambitious beginnings</h4>



<p><strong>Saey:</strong> My first memory of the Human Genome Project was when I was an undergraduate student at the University of Nebraska in Lincoln, and I remember Walter Gilbert, who is a Nobel Prize winner, coming and talking about the project. He proposed this really audacious idea of sequencing 3 billion pairs of bases in the human genome — all of our DNA. After Gilbert’s talk, I walked back to the lab with a couple of professors, and they were saying, “This can never happen. It’s going to cost way too much money. There’s just no way we can do this.” So how did you pull it off?</p>



<p><strong>Green:</strong> By the time the genome project started in October of 1990, I was working in a cutting-edge genomics lab at Washington University. We were one of the first funded groups to participate in the Human Genome Project. We had some ideas on how to start, and we had really no idea how we were going to pull it off.</p>



<p>It was the overwhelmingly compelling vision for why this was so important that galvanized enthusiasm among not only a group of scientists like myself, but also the funding agencies, the governments, the private funders from around the world, who said, “This seems unimaginable, like putting a person on the moon, but it seems so important. We’ll figure it out.” So it was one of these circumstances where you just get the right people in the right place, get them resourced, get them organized, be willing to do things differently, and then figure it out as you go.</p>





<p><strong>Saey:</strong> I got to witness this because I was a graduate student at Washington University, in a lab sequencing the yeast genome. Robert Waterston’s lab, which received one of the first grants from the Human Genome Project, was right across the hall. They started with <em>C. elegans</em>, the roundworm genome. I remember they were starting very methodically, mapping out the genes and then sequencing each piece, marching along. But then, toward the end of the ’90s, there was <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/another-human-genome-project">this shotgun sequencing revolution</a> spearheaded by kind of a controversial figure, Craig Venter. You just shred the genome, throw it all in a sequencing machine and then put it together in the computer. Did that help a lot?</p>



<p><strong>Green:</strong> There’s no question it sped things up. What Craig successfully did was to determine that there were approaches that could be used where you didn’t have to do piecemeal sequencing. The important nuance to point out is the only way you’re able to put [the pieces] back together then was by having many mapping elements that allow you to hang pieces together and organize them. It’s not like it all zipped together 3 billion letters. A lot of the meticulous mapping that had been done, painstaking mapping, helped provide organizing guideposts.</p>



<p>The press covered it as a race, and the press covered it as option A versus option B. And the truth resided somewhere in between. What was driving the change, of course, was technology advances. If you chart the time since the end of the Human Genome Project, it’s the same phenomenon. Every single time there’s a technology surge, you find yourself doing things completely different than the way you used to.</p>



<p><strong>Saey:</strong> Technology has come a very long way from what I was doing. You can sequence thousands of bases at a time now.</p>



<p><strong>Green:</strong> The other part of the story that sometimes doesn’t get told: It’s not even just the laboratory bench–based technologies. It’s also the computational technologies. Some people don’t realize that when the Human Genome Project started, there was not really a widely functional internet. I was just barely starting to use e-mail.</p>



<p>So here it was, we were one of the first funded groups for the Human Genome Project. We were considered state of the art. We were collaborating with an outside group generating some sequences, and the only practical way for my collaborator to get me the 300 to 400 bases of sequence was to handwrite it on a piece of paper and fax it to me. And I would analyze it by eye. It’s just remarkable that that was where we were when the project started.</p>

<h4>Garbage to gold mine</h4>



<p><strong>Saey:</strong> In 2000 was the big press conference to announce the rough draft of the human genome. I was just starting my journalism career at the <em>St. Louis Post-Dispatch</em>, and reported on this. At that time, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/newly-sequenced-genome-bares-all">it was a big revelation that there were these big deserts in between genes</a>, and that we didn’t have nearly as many genes as we thought we were going to. Humans are such complex organisms, how could we not have many more genes than a fruit fly, or a worm? That just didn’t make sense.</p>



<p>But now, I think, we are getting a better understanding, largely because of the way we can analyze the genome. Can you talk about how that evolution in thinking has progressed?</p>



<p><strong>Green:</strong> Before the genome project started, some [people] were quite critical, and really said it was a bad idea. Some argued that it was a waste of time to sequence the genome end to end; we should just focus and sequence the genes, as if all of humans’ biological richness was going to reside in the genes. Thank goodness we didn’t listen to those critics. Because if we would have done the shortcut and only focused on the genes, we would have only skimmed the biological complexity of humans.</p>



<p>What we’ve come to learn is that while only 1.5 percent of the letters of the human genome directly encode for what are classically known as protein-coding genes — DNA that gets made into RNA, which gets made into protein — there’s a much larger fraction of the human genome that is biologically important and evolutionarily conserved. It’s widened our definition of a gene, because we now know that sometimes DNA may make RNA, and RNA may go off and do all sorts of biological things.</p>



<p>Then there’s a whole set of sequences that are far more plentiful than gene sequences, that are really doing all the choreography in our genomes in terms of determining when, where and how much genes get turned on, in what cells and what tissues, at what developmental stages, under what conditions, and so on and so forth.</p>



<p>It pushed us to think about all the other biological functions in DNA outside the genes. And as you accurately point out, we don’t really have a rulebook for that. And thank goodness the computer technology is helping us because the human eye would just fail miserably at figuring this out. And so as much as anything, computational biology, bioinformatics, data science are the dominant research tools to help bring clarity as to how noncoding sequences in the human genome function. And how they do that in a very carefully crafted choreography with the genes.</p>

<p><strong>Saey:</strong> Well, I’m glad you brought up those sequences, because those are some of my favorites. I’m a huge fan of noncoding RNAs [the RNAs that don’t go on to make proteins]. There are so many of them, and such a huge variety of them. And <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/rna-molecules-crucial-roles-human-health-disease">they work in so many important ways</a> (<em>SN: 4/13/19, p. 22</em>).</p>



<p>I don’t think that 20 years ago we could have conceived that RNAs that didn’t make proteins would actually be important for something. The genes those RNAs were copied from were considered broken genes or pseudogenes. They were junk.</p>



<p><strong>Green:</strong> Or sloppy transcription; that our enzymes are just going off and making a bunch of RNA because they don’t know how to control themselves. But, no. And I like your point about 20 years ago, we couldn’t imagine. I would propose that 20 years from now, we might look back at this conversation and say, “Oh, my goodness, think about all these other ways that the genome functions.” There’s no reason to think we have our hands around it all in terms of all the biological complexity of DNA; I’m quite sure we don’t.</p>



<p><strong>Saey:</strong> And even when you find a protein-coding gene, you’re <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/brain-wiring-depends-multifaceted-gene">not just making one protein</a>. You’re making, on average, seven or eight different versions of this protein from the same gene. After RNA gets copied from DNA, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/more-chicken-fewer-grape">you can mix and match the little parts of a gene</a> to make completely new proteins. And then you can tack on all of these other little chemical groups to change the way things work.</p>



<p><strong>Green:</strong> When I was getting my Ph.D. at Washington University in the 1980s, I didn’t work on DNA, I didn’t work on molecular biology, I didn’t work on RNA. I was working on a set of proteins, studying how they had sugar molecules added to them after they were made, and how, depending upon what tissue they were made in, they got different structures of sugar molecules attached. So just as you point out, you start off with one gene, and you can end up with multiple RNAs that lead to multiple different proteins. And each of those proteins could have different modifications depending on what tissue, what conditions, what development stage, et cetera. This is the incredible amplification of complexity. It’s not in our gene number. We have a long way to go to fully understanding all this.</p>

</div>



<p><strong>Saey:</strong> Another thing that really surprises people is how much of our genome is made of extinct viruses and transposons — transposons being these <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/jumping-genes-play-big-role-what-makes-us-human">jumping genes that still hop around in our genome</a>. Those transposons can occasionally cause problems, but we also got a lot of innovations from them, including the human placenta, and maybe some things about the way our brain works. So, we’re not even completely human. If you want to view it that way, we’re a lot virus.</p>



<p><strong>Green:</strong> Right. We’re a lot virus. We’re also not all <em>Homo sapiens</em>. Many, many people <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/human-evolution-mating-2021-research">carry Neandertal bits</a> from a time when Neandertals and <em>Homo sapiens</em> coexisted, and actually interbred (<em>SN: 5/8/21 &amp; 5/22/21, p. 7</em>). But not everybody in the world has that, which is also interesting. One of the aspects of genomics is that it not only has taught us and given us the biological instruction book, it’s also given us a fascinating record of evolution. We can use it to learn lots of things about our evolution, about human migrations, about aspects of humans on this globe.</p>



<h4>Focus on diversity</h4>



<p><strong>Saey:</strong> Most people who are interacting with DNA and with the human genome these days do it through <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/consumer-genetic-testing-ancestry-dna">ancestry testing and consumer DNA testing</a>. So you can identify the part of the world that people’s DNA came from. And that gets into a lot of discussion about race, and whether race has a biological basis, and what that might mean for medicine.</p>



<p>There’s been a lot of criticism lately of genetics and genomics, because it’s <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/genetics-race-dna-databases-reference-genome-too-white">based a lot on the DNA of people of European ancestry</a> — white people like you and me. But there’s a huge amount of genetic diversity in the world among humans, and especially in Africa, where humans got started. So what are we doing about getting a handle on the vast array of diversity that humans have?</p>



<p><strong>Green:</strong> There’s no question that the successes in genomics that we’ve been discussing are worth talking about and worth show­casing. At the same time, as a field, we have not been perfect. One of the things that we just have to admit that we’ve really not been as successful on is making sure we’ve captured enough of the diversity of the human population with respect to the samples that we’ve used for doing genetic and genomic studies. We have got to fix this problem. It’s a very high priority.</p>



<p>I really want to emphasize, it’s not even just that it’s the socially right thing to do, that everybody should have information about their genomes. This is very important medically. If the only populations we have a lot of genomic data on are people of European descent, we limit our ability to move genomic analyses and eventually genomic medicine into populations that are not of European descent. And so there’s a high priority through a number of efforts around the world, including in the U.S., to work hard to capture much more diversity of the world’s populations in all studies that we do.</p>



<p><strong>Saey:</strong> There’s been a lot of talk about racialized medicine, where you might have a person come in who is African American, and then you would say, “Oh, well, we should consider this to be the genome that we look at.” Is that a good approach to take? Or do you think it should be broader somehow?</p>



<p><strong>Green:</strong> The truth is, of course, there are certain diseases that tend to cluster in certain populations of common ancestry. And many times those are represented by racial groups.</p>



<p>But racial grouping is really a social construct that has numerous imperfections. And so on the one hand, you can’t totally ignore some correlations that exist with certain diseases or certain responses to medications in certain groups. But it’s a very blunt tool to use. And we could do better. The way we could do this better is to track much more accurately to specific genomic features, as opposed to certain racial characteristics. So I think what we really want to pay attention to, and we will be doing this increasingly, is thinking about better ways of grouping and stratifying individuals and populations.</p>

<p><strong>Saey:</strong> I wanted to touch too on what we mean when we say genetic diversity. For the most part I think people are familiar with what scientists call SNPs, single nucleotide polymorphisms, and what other people might refer to as mutations. But there are lots of other ways that you can have diversity in the genome: You can be missing entire genes or entire chunks of chromosomes or you can have duplications of certain genes. Are we now able to look at that type of diversity as well? And do we know if that’s important?</p>



<p><strong>Green:</strong> There’s no question that all forms of genomic diversity — genomic variation is probably the word I would use — are not only biologically relevant, they’re proving to be medically relevant. Now, we don’t have a complete inventory of which ones are more relevant than others. But we already know of many examples where medically relevant variations in our genome can be a single letter, a string of letters, it could mean having extra letters or extra segments, or missing segments. It could be a rearrangement of segments. Every one of those [types of variations] are already known to be important in human disease, and eventually will be important for diagnostic medicine and the implementation of genomic medicine.</p>



<p><strong>Saey:</strong> Do you envision a time when we will be able to study and interpret these bigger changes?</p>



<p><strong>Green:</strong> I absolutely envision a time where people will get their complete genome sequenced end to end as part of their medical care, and maybe even at birth. I don’t think we’re there yet. But I truly believe that we will want that information as part of medical management. And I fully believe that technologies will become available and will be inexpensive enough to make it worthwhile. But those predictions are going to have to be based on evidence that indeed that’s feasible and valuable.</p>



<h4>What’s next?</h4>



<p><strong>Saey:</strong> So <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/first-human-genome-project-20th-anniversary-future">where do we go from here</a>? What does the National Human Genome Research Institute do now that researchers have generated end-to-end sequences of every human chromosome?</p>



<p><strong>Green:</strong> We recently finished a two-and-a-half-year strategic planning process to ask that very question for this coming decade. It was actually an overwhelming exercise because there were so many good ideas. We published <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2817-4">these in <em>Nature</em></a> — our 2020 strategic vision. Some of it [is] applications of genomics to medicine. Of course, everybody’s going to be excited about that. But there are many other forefronts of genomics that are just as exciting.</p>



<p>We still don’t have the perfect technologies that we can deploy anywhere in the world in any health setting, any medical study, that will get us end-to-end sequencing. We need better and cheaper technologies for letting us read human genome sequences inexpensively in clinical settings. We need complete end-to-end interpretation of every base of the human genome. We need to know not just about the genes, we need to know about all these noncoding regions. We need to understand every human variant that we can find in the world population. And we need to know: Is that variant biologically silent? Is it biologically relevant? Is it medically relevant? If it’s medically relevant, what’s the action that should be taken? That starts to point us to understanding the genomic basis of disease and also to think about how can we use information about genomic variation in the practice of medicine.</p>



<p>Also, we will continue to think about the implications of these genomic advances to society. How are we going to make sure people understand this? How are we going to make sure things are applied equitably? How are we going to make sure it doesn’t exacerbate inequities in our society? How are we going to deal with a whole host of issues related to privacy?</p>

<p><strong>Saey:</strong> I’m glad that you brought up equity and privacy, because those are some of the things that people are most concerned about right now. There are a lot of historically marginalized people who don’t want any part of genetic research because of the way their groups have been treated in the past. There’s been this history of colonialism. These groups say, if we’re going to do genetics on our people, then it should be our people doing it for us. What is NHGRI doing to build capacity in these communities so that they can do their own research and, maybe, if they decide they want to, share that with other people?</p>



<p><strong>Green:</strong> I completely agree with the notion that if genomics is going to be a successful field, especially as we move this into medicine, we have got to make sure that we engage people from all different communities, all definitions of diversity, and make sure they benefit from it. We absolutely emphasize this point repeatedly in our 2020 strategic vision, so much so that the very first thing we did in 2021 was to release what we call <a href="https://www.genome.gov/news/news-release/NHGRI-proposes-an-action-agenda-for-building-a-diverse-genomics-workforce">an action agenda for enhancing the diversity of the genomics workforce</a>.</p>



<p>Another experience we’ve had at NIH that I think is very illustrative of this: We recognized that we wanted African scientists to get more involved in doing genomics. And through a program called H3Africa, the <a href="https://h3africa.org/">Human Heredity and Health in Africa program</a>, that the NIH and the Wellcome Trust funded, the philosophical mantra is to empower African scientists to do all the studies and build capacity there. It’s been a success by almost any metric. But it’s exactly what you said: We want them to do the studies, we want them to engage with their local communities. We’ll never build the trust if we just come in and say, “We’re going to do all of this.”</p>



<p><strong>Saey:</strong> In terms of privacy, you’ve said a couple of times that you could have somebody’s genome completely sequenced, and then their doctor can use it. But don’t we get into a situation that could be like the movie <em>Gattaca</em>? Some people could be discriminated against if they don’t have their genetic flaws fixed? Are you somehow creating a class of lesser people and more perfect people who don’t have the genetic flaws that everybody else has?</p>



<p><strong>Green:</strong> You just laid out several major ethical dilemmas, and they’re all valid, and we could spend hours talking about each of them. What I would say about our field is, we’ve recognized that everything we are doing is a two-edged sword. On the one edge of that sword are these incredible opportunities for improving the practice of medicine. On the other edge of that sword, as with many technologies, it could be used in ways that would be societally unacceptable. It’s a reason why the field has from the beginning always embraced and invested in <a href="https://www.genome.gov/Funded-Programs-Projects/ELSI-Research-Program-ethical-legal-social-implications">ethical, legal and social implications research</a>, or ELSI research, which has attempted to anticipate these concerns and try to provide an evidence base to build policies, and in some cases, laws.</p>



<p>We do have in the United States a major act called the <a href="https://www.eeoc.gov/statutes/genetic-information-nondiscrimination-act-2008">Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act</a>, which offers some protection against genetic discrimination. We have laws and policies that protect people’s medical information.</p>

<p>We should recognize that genomics is just part of a bigger set of societal issues, as more and more intimate information about us is electronically available. Trust me, we can learn a lot about you if we just reviewed your Visa card purchases. We as a society have to recognize that, yes, genomic information has some unique attributes, but it’s not totally exceptional. We need to be part of a broader framework for protecting people so that we can benefit from these incredible opportunities.</p>



<p>We just need to make sure we don’t get too far out over our skis. Just because we can do something, doesn’t mean we should. We need to think about all the consequences. We should be constantly understanding what will society tolerate, what do people not want. We have some things that are going to be completely unacceptable, like doing genetic editing in unborn children. At this stage, we simply don’t think that’s a smart thing to do, we’re not ready to do it, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/gene-edited-babies-top-science-stories-2018-yir">the scientific community has condemned doing it</a> (<em>SN: 12/22/18 &amp; 1/5/19, p. 20</em>).</p>



<p><strong>Saey:</strong> I do want to circle back, because when we were talking about these noncoding sequences, a lot of them help control how genes are used. That may not be so obvious if you just get this string of somebody’s DNA letters. Can you tell from that how those genes will be used? And how those things will be put together? Or is that something you cannot tell by looking at DNA?</p>



<p><strong>Green:</strong> There’s no question that sometimes when you talk about genomics, and you talk about genetics, and you focus on the genes — you sometimes see the tree and you lose track of the forest. The forest is medical complexity and biological complexity. And for most things about ourselves, how tall we are, what we look like, and common diseases — hypertension, diabetes, Alzheimer’s, autism, et cetera — things are much more complicated than looking even for one gene. It’s multiple genes. And it’s almost always a greater choreography with our lifestyle, and our social experiences, and our exposures and everything from diet to exercise. There’s a lot more to health and disease than just our genes.</p>



<p>The grand challenge in many ways for the coming decade or two is doing these very large-scale studies where we have as much data as possible, not just genomic data, but lifestyle data and electronic health record data, and environmental data and physiological data. There are absolutely going to be patterns. And we’ve just got to find those patterns.</p>



<p><strong>Saey:</strong> We’re almost out of time. It’s been wonderful talking with you. Did we miss anything?</p>



<p><strong>Green:</strong> We missed all sorts of wonderful things, but you can only spend so much time walking down memory lane.</p>



<p>What I would say in closing are two things people need to remember: First of all, how incredibly exciting this field is, and how incredibly eager we are to build our tent with more and more people from all different disciplines. And we also want people of all different populations and ancestral groups from all parts of the world. It’s going to be so important to do that.</p>



<p>The reason we want all these people involved is, we just touched on so many things that we still don’t understand. We need creativity. And we don’t have a playbook. Just like those days where we were bewildered of how we were going to get the Human Genome Project really done, I don’t really know how we’re going to get complete end-to-end understanding of the human genome. But I know if we get creative people working on it, we’ll make incredible progress.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/genetic-data-represent-black-people-tshaka-cunningham">How one scientist aims to boost Black people’s representation in genetic datasets</a></h4>

              
                <p>Nearly two decades after researchers assembled the first genetic blueprint for human life, our understanding of our instruction manual has a dramatic and problematic bias: It’s based primarily on white people.</p>



<p>The overwhelming majority of genetic data is from people of European ancestry. As of early January, nearly 96 percent of participants across more than 5,500 studies looking for genetic variants associated with disease or other traits were of European descent, according to the <a href="https://gwasdiversitymonitor.com/">GWAS Diversity Monitor</a>, a real-time online tracker developed and maintained by the Leverhulme Centre for Demographic Science at the University of Oxford. Those with African American or Afro-Caribbean ancestry amount to just 0.18 percent of participants; Hispanic or Latino populations just 0.23 percent. That means efforts aspiring to use DNA to identify the best treatments for any individual patient, what’s commonly known as precision medicine, are heavily skewed toward white people.</p>



<p>There are many reasons behind the stark disparity. A big one, says geneticist Tshaka Cunningham, is distrust of the medical community, born from decades of exploitation and abuse: The Tuskegee Study, where white researchers for decades didn’t treat Black men with syphilis, even after penicillin proved effective against the disease. The case of Henrietta Lacks, whose cervical cancer biopsy gave rise to cells that today serve as a crucial resource for scientific studies even though she never gave consent. The forced sterilization of Black, Latina and Indigenous women that was driven by the eugenics movement — the damaging effects of which persist today.</p>

<p>What happened to Lacks, for example, “left a scar on many a minority person,” Cunningham says. “It’s like, ‘Am I gonna get Henrietta Lacks-ed or Tuskegee-ed?’”</p>



<p>Cunningham is working with others to build trust and overcome the damage of the past. He is chief scientific officer of Polaris Genomics, a company studying the genetic underpinnings that put some people at increased risk of certain behavioral health conditions, including post-traumatic stress disorder. He is also executive director of the <a href="https://www.fbgri.org">Faith Based Genetic Research Institute</a>, a nonprofit that aims to educate people, primarily people of color, about the value of engaging with the medical community and genetics research.</p>



<p><em>Science News’</em> Erin Garcia de Jesús spoke with Cunningham about the need for diverse data in genetics and the challenges researchers face in reaching minority groups.</p>



<p><strong>Garcia de Jesús: Why is it important to have diverse participants in genetics research?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Cunningham:</strong> One is the societal imperative for equity — and having research, and products [such as genetic tests and treatments] be broadly available for people. You don’t want to have health disparities between communities. And when it comes to genetics, genomics and precision medicine, you already see this growing divide pushed by one-sided research. Mostly Caucasian groups have been included in genomic research to date, yet the results are meant to be applied to all others too.</p>



<p>There are genetic tests, for example, that have been developed based on research in specific communities. Like for <em>BRCA1</em>. [Mutations in the gene have been linked to a higher risk of breast cancer and are commonly considered in deciding on treatment approach.] You may have a set of <em>BRCA1</em> mutations that have been defined from studies in Caucasian female populations, but those variants might not be the same variants present in minority female populations, particularly people of African descent or African Americans. So how good is the <em>BRCA1</em> test for a community of African American patients? Probably not so good.</p>



<p>Then there’s the scientific imperative. Even if you don’t feel strongly about equality for equality’s sake, you can appreciate that for scientific reasons, we want to have as diverse a dataset as we can. That’s how we can really understand the universe of potential genetic variation and what it means.</p>

<p><strong>Garcia de Jesús: </strong><strong>What prevents that kind of diversity in current studies?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Cunningham:</strong> I think in the United States — and I can really speak only from my experience in the United States — it’s because of the history of racial and ethnic division in our country, and some of the crimes that have been perpetrated on specific groups, even in medical science. African Americans have lived through slavery. They’ve lived through Jim Crow. They’ve lived through Tuskegee. They’ve lived through Henrietta Lacks. And they’ve lived through, in their own lives, any number of discriminations at the hands of the medical system. It creates systemic distrust for many from the African American community that would make them hesitant to participate in scientific studies.</p>



<p>The Latino population may have different reasons. If you’re in the United States and you’re a recent immigrant who is not necessarily documented, you might not trust the establishment with your information. Or even if you are documented, you may not trust the establishment.</p>



<p>The Tuskegee study left a lot of psychological damage in certain communities. It’s created a severe mistrust that can often work counter to people’s overall health — the hesitancy to participate in genetic studies that could greatly benefit the community by driving developments in precision medicine, and even the hesitancy to take the vaccine for COVID-19. That distrust took hundreds of years to develop. We’re only in the last few decades really trying to do anything meaningful to address it.</p>





<p><strong>Garcia de Jesús: </strong><strong>What kind of work are you doing to overcome that distrust?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Cunningham:</strong> Our goal at the Faith Based Genetic Research Institute is to build some of those trust bonds, particularly through communities of faith — African American churches, Latino churches and others who are meeting people where they are in a religious context. Our goal is also to share information about how precision medicine, gene therapy, gene editing and advanced technology are going to impact the medical field and impact people’s health and well-being, but through trusted sources who are folks from their community.</p>



<p>One of the strategies we employ is called the honest broker strategy; the people who are talking about the technology to the community are from the community. [We think about] who’s representing the science, who’s communicating the science, who’s telling you why you should participate. So I’m not bringing a bunch of white, male scientists into a community of African American and Latino churchgoers. I’m bringing in Black male and Black female scientists who are from the community.</p>



<p>It’s challenging because you don’t have as many scientists of color. There’s a training issue on that part. I think the National Institutes of Health and the National Science Foundation and other organizations have done a good job of identifying the problem. I’m hoping that they will come up with some real tactical solutions.</p>

<p><strong>Garcia de Jesús: </strong><strong>What kind of information do you share in these community meetings, and have you seen success?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Cunningham:</strong> We have a preview lecture called DNA 101. We walk through, what is DNA? What is a mutation? What is a single nucleotide polymorphism, and how do they apply to health and disease? Why is it important for you to know what single nucleotide polymorphisms are? Because it’ll help you get a better idea of what diseases you’re predisposed to. And to give you a leg up on treatment.</p>



<p>That’s where we meet people. And we’ve had a lot of success. Generally after one of our in-person sessions — which we haven’t been able to do since COVID-19 — we’ve had a lot of interest from folks, some who came with questions and some who had never been approached about getting a genetic test before.</p>



<p>We have one grant called the <a href="https://www.genomes2people.org/research/peopleseq/">PeopleSeq Consortium</a> in partnership with places including the Broad Institute and Harvard University that surveys individuals’ attitudes toward participating in elective genetic testing. Before we joined the effort, the program had five African Americans who completed the survey and sent their samples for testing. After we got involved, that number increased to 50 within one year. Our work is making a difference, but we still have a long way to go.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Garcia de Jesús: </strong><strong>Looking back at how far genetics research has come, where do you think it’s headed? </strong><strong></strong></p>



<p><strong>Cunningham:</strong> There’s a research imperative to understand every genome, because all genomes matter. But we have to make sure that we go above and beyond what we’ve been doing to understand minority genomes, because minority genomes especially matter. They have not been studied. I think it is long overdue.</p>



<p>Science has long been the domain of the wealthy, who have been in positions to define the pace and the communities that get studied. We’ve got to get out of that. As a community, we’ve got to say, “No, that’s not in the best interest of science, and it’s not in the best interest of society.” So let’s really lean in and do it different.</p>



<p>I’m hopeful that newer generations of researchers — Caucasian and nonminority researchers — are realizing that and saying “Hey, look, we can’t do business as we did. We’re really going to try to open this up and diversify for the sake of science and the sake of society.”</p>

              <h4><a href="http://biocomputation.herts.ac.uk/2022/02/09/learning-to-count-everything.html">Learning To Count Everything</a></h4>

              
                <p>This week on Journal Club session Minghua Zheng will talk about a paper &quot;Learning To Count Everything&quot;.</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>Existing works on visual counting primarily focus on one specific
category at a time, such as people, animals, and cells. In this paper,
we are interested in counting everything, that is to count objects
from any category given only a few annotated instances from that
category. To this end, we pose counting as a few-shot regression task.
To tackle this task, we present a novel method that takes a query
image together with a few exemplar objects from the query image and
predicts a density map for the presence of all objects of interest in
the query image. We also present a novel adaptation strategy to adapt
our network to any novel visual category at test time, using only a
few exemplar objects from the novel category. We also introduce a
dataset of 147 object categories containing over 6000 images that are
suitable for the few-shot counting task. The images are annotated with
two types of annotation, dots and bounding boxes, and they can be used
for developing few-shot counting models. Experiments on this dataset
shows that our method outperforms several state-of-the-art object
detectors and few-shot counting approaches. Our code and dataset can

              <h4><a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2022/02/09/offenders-feel-like-victims-when-their-victims-dont-forgive-them/">Offenders feel like victims when their victims don’t forgive them</a></h4>

              
                <p><em>By </em><a href="http://emilyoliviareynolds.com/">Emily Reynolds</a></p>



<p>Forgiveness is not always easy. Forgiving someone who has wronged you can lead to a decreased likelihood of repeat offending and increased likelihood that the perpetrator will engage in conciliatory behaviour — just some of the reasons <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2015/12/01/whats-it-like-to-meet-the-man-who-murdered-your-brother/">restorative justice</a> has become more popular. But victims of transgressions often find it hard to move on.</p>



<p>A <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/01461672211062401">study published in <em>Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin</em></a> looks at what happens when victims don’t forgive and forget — and specifically how this makes offenders feel. The team finds that, if not offered forgiveness, those who have committed transgressions end up feeling like victims too.</p>



<span id="more-45323"></span>



<p>In the first study, Michael Thai from The University of Queensland and colleagues asked participants to recall a situation in which they had wronged somebody and had subsequently given a sincere apology. Half of the participants were asked to recall a situation in which they were forgiven, and the other half a situation in which they weren’t.</p>



<p>All participants described the situation in writing, before indicating how much their victim’s response constituted a violation of norms; how much it threatened their sense of power, control, and dignity; how much <em>they</em> felt like a victim in the situation; how much they regretted their apology; and how willing they were to reconcile with the person to whom they had given the apology.</p>



<p>Those who were not forgiven saw the victim’s response as a greater violation of norms than those who had been forgiven. They also saw this response as a greater threat to their sense of power. As a result, these participants also felt more like victims themselves than those who had been forgiven, and this made them less willing to reconcile and to feel more regret about making the apology.</p>



<p>This pattern of results was replicated in a second study. This time, participants read a scenario in which they had let down a fellow student and had to write a letter of apology, receiving either a response that expressed forgiveness or was non-forgiving.</p>



<p>The third study looked at neutral or ambiguous responses alongside forgiveness and non-forgiveness. As in study two, participants were asked to imagine that they had wronged somebody and wrote a message to this person to apologise. Some participants received a reply forgiving them; some not forgiving them; and some containing a more ambivalent statement where forgiveness was not clear.</p>



<p>Non-forgiveness, again, was more likely to be seen as a violation of norms, reduced the likelihood of reconciliation, impacted on power and control, and made participants feel like victims, compared to both a forgiving response and a more ambiguous one. Those who saw ambiguous replies did not feel like victims and did not see any norm violation compared to those who were forgiven, suggesting that a lack of forgiveness isn’t quite the same as explicitly refusing to forgive someone. However, people who read an ambiguous reply did still feel less power and control. The team suggests that an apology “puts power back in the hands of victims” — they can choose whether to forgive or bear a grudge, representing a loss of control for offenders that is only regained once forgiveness has been granted overtly.</p>



<p>So, overall, not being forgiven for a transgression was seen as a violation of norms, a threat to power and control, leading to a sense of oneself as the victim of the situation. This also led to poorer outcomes — a smaller likelihood of reconciliation, for example. This could be useful information when considering restorative or transformative justice — if a victim is unlikely to forgive a perpetrator, then the process may not work as hoped, or other strategies may need to be exercised to mitigate chances of non-reconciliation.</p>



<p>The team points to previous research that suggests victims are often socially pressured into accepting apologies; future work could look at the motivations behind non-forgiveness. Non-forgiveness presumably has a relationship to severity of transgression — if someone’s forgotten to text you back and you don’t forgive them, there’s probably more at play than not forgiving someone for greater wrongdoing. There are also more nuanced examples of victim-transgressor relationships: dynamics where both parties have, across the course of their relationship, played both roles. These, too, are worth exploring.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/pterosaur-fossils-puke-pellet-regurgitation-food">Fossils reveal that pterosaurs puked pellets</a></h4>

              
                <p>Picture it: Two hungry pterosaurs, one adult and one juvenile, settle down to dig in to a delicious lunch of fish. Down their gullets the whole fish go. A little later, back up come the scales and other indigestible fishy bits, vomited neatly as millimeter-sized pellets.</p>



<p>Scientists now have the first fossilized evidence that pterosaur dining included a final course of regurgitation, scientifically called antiperistalsis. While studying two specimens of <em>Kunpengopterus sinensis</em>, a pterosaur species that lived in what is now China between 199 million and 146 million years ago, researchers <a href="https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rstb.2021.0043">found a gastric pellet containing fossilized fish scales</a> preserved alongside each individual, they report February 7 in <em>Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society B</em>.</p>



<p>That pterosaurs gave those inedible bits the old heave-ho isn’t a surprise. The flying reptiles’ family tree is full of gastric pellet–expelling species, from living birds such as owls and gulls to fossilized cousins like ancient crocodilians and non-avian dinosaurs.</p>



<p>But the study does help flesh out <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/pterosaurs-fossil-flight-hatchling">what little is known</a> about pterosaur diet and digestion (<em>SN: 7/22/21</em>). It reveals that members of this species, at least, were fish eaters. (Other possibly tree-climbing members of the genus <em>Kunpengopterus</em> <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/monkeydactyl-jurassic-pterosaur-oldest-fossil-opposable-thumbs">may have dined on insects</a> (<em>SN: 4/14/21</em>).) The find also suggests that, like modern birds, these pterosaurs had two-part stomachs: an acid-secreting part to dissolve the food, and a muscular gizzard to compact the indigestible bits into a pellet.</p>



<p>Based on the size of the scales in the larger pellet, found next to the adult, the fish it was eating was much larger than most fish fossils found at the site, the researchers note. That suggests that rather than opportunistically scavenging any fish that washed up onshore, <em>K. sinensis</em> may have been a hunter, actively choosing the largest prey it could catch.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/sponges-deep-sea-arctic-feed-eat-fossil-organisms-survival">Deep-sea Arctic sponges feed on fossilized organisms to survive</a></h4>

              
                <p>In the cold, dark depths of the Arctic Ocean, a feast of the dead is under way.</p>



<p>A vast community of sponges, the densest group of these animals found in the Arctic, is <a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-022-28129-7">consuming the remains of an ancient ecosystem to survive</a>, researchers report February 8 in <em>Nature Communications</em>.</p>



<p>The study highlights just how opportunistic sponges are, says Jasper de Goeij, a deep-sea ecologist at the University of Amsterdam not involved with this work. Evolutionarily speaking, sponges “are more than 600 million years old, and they inhabit all parts of our globe,” he says. Scientists might not know about all of them because many places that sponges inhabit are really difficult to get to, he adds.</p>



<p>Sponges are predominantly filter feeders, and are crucial to nutrient recycling throughout the oceans. The existence of this colony, discovered by a research ship in 2016, however, has been an enigma.</p>





<p>The sponges, which include the species <em>Geodia parva</em>, <em>G. hentscheli</em> and <em>Stelletta rhaphidiophora</em>, live between 700 and 1,000 meters down in the central Arctic Ocean, where there are virtually no currents to provide food, and sea ice covers the water year-round. What’s more, sponges are largely immobile, yet in 2021 researchers, including Teresa Morganti, a marine biologist at the Max Planck Institute for Marine Microbiology in Bremen, Germany, <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0960982221003535">reported that these ones slowly move</a>, using their spicules — microscopic skeletal structures — and leaving them as thick brown trails in their wake.</p>





<p>In the new study, Morganti and colleagues turned their attention to the matted layer underneath the sponge colony, a smorgasbord of discarded spicules and blackened fossilized life, including empty worm tubes and mollusk shells. To see if this thick mat was a food source, the team analyzed samples of the sponges, the mat material and the surrounding water. The researchers also investigated the genetic makeup of the microbes that live within the sponge tissues, and those in the sediment.</p>



<p>Carbon and nitrogen isotopes — atoms with different numbers of neutrons — in the sponge tissues closely matched those of the dead matter below, suggesting the animals were consuming it. The <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/microscopic-menagerie">genetic signature of the microbes</a> showed they had enzymes capable of breaking down the material and were likely dissolving the dead organic matter into food for the sponges (<em>SN: 12/27/13</em>).</p>



<p>The matted layer is up to 15 centimeters thick in places, the researchers found. Assuming that the layer is, on average, greater than 4 centimeters thick, it could provide almost five times the carbon that the sponges would need to survive, the team calculates.</p>



<p>The discovery that the sponges are feeding from below means they are likely moving to access more food, Morganti and colleagues suggest. The scientists also found many sponges to be budding, or breaking off parts to form new individuals, showing active reproduction.</p>



<p>Radiocarbon dating showed the adult sponges — spread across more than 15 square kilometers on the peaks of an underwater volcanic mountain range — to be over 300 years old on average, a “truly outstanding” finding, says Paco Cardenas, a sponge expert at Uppsala University in Sweden who was not involved with the new study. “We expected sponges to grow very slowly, but this had never been measured in the deep sea,” he says.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p><a></a>The dead ecosystem below the sponges is around 2,000 to 3,000 years older, a once-thriving community of animals that lived in the nutrient-rich conditions created when the volcanoes were last active, the researchers suggest.</p>



<p>Sponges often appear to take advantage of the most abundant carbon sources, which may change as global warming alters the composition of the oceans, says ecologist Stephanie Archer of the ​​Louisiana Universities Marine Consortium in Chauvin, who was not involved in the work. “One big question will be how flexible sponge-microbe associations are, and how quickly they change to take advantage of shifting carbon sources,” she says.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/military-towns-integration-segregation-united-states">Military towns are the most racially integrated places in the U.S. Here’s why</a></h4>

              
                <p class="has-drop-cap" style="font-size:20px">Amber Williams and her husband bought their first house in 2008 for $80,000 in the small military city of Killeen, Texas. “I wanted to go big and bad, but he nipped that in the bud,” Williams quips.</p>



<p>For this Army veteran, who launched her own personal training company in 2013, buying even a modest home meant that she’d reached a new station in life, moving up from her lower-income beginnings. “We actually lived in a mobile home all of my childhood,” she says.</p>



<p>Williams, a Black woman, first arrived at Fort Hood, the Army base near Killeen, in 2006. She returned to the base after two deployments to Iraq, and her children, now ages 11 and 13, were born there. This area, where life revolves around Fort Hood, the area’s largest employer, has become home, she says.</p>



<p>About an hour’s drive from the state capital of Austin, Killeen ranks as one of the most integrated metropolitan areas in the country, according to a 2021 report by researchers at the University of California, Berkeley. To identify segregated pockets within a larger geographic area, the report compares the proportion of racial minorities in a smaller area, such as a neighborhood, with its larger region, such as a county.</p>



<p>Integration in Killeen is evident in everyday life, Williams says. Her neighbors come from many different backgrounds, and her children have had several Black teachers, even though the vast majority of U.S. public school teachers are white. Most of her friends in Killeen, also current or former military, are in interracial relationships.</p>

<p>Killeen is not an anomaly. The UC Berkeley researchers found that the most integrated places in the country have a strong military presence, including larger cities such as Fayetteville, N.C., and Colorado’s Aurora and Colorado Springs. “The biggest players for effective integration ended up being these military towns,” says social psychologist Lindsey Burnside of UC Berkeley, who worked on the report.</p>



<p>Integration in these places is no accident. By the late 1940s, the military was starting to realize that segregation threatened troop cohesion and efficiency, says economist Chantal Smith of Washington and Lee University in Lexington, Va.</p>





<p>What’s more, military leaders could enforce desegregation efforts much more aggressively than leaders in civilian institutions due to the notion of rank over race, Smith says. “The military is on some level color-blind. Orders are orders. You follow the orders.”</p>



<p>That hierarchical structure can lead to abuses within the institution, such as leaders ignoring reports of mental health problems and sexual violence. But that same structure translates to service members of all races gaining equal access to education benefits, housing, pensions and health insurance.</p>



<p>The body of research available today, which largely focuses on the Black-white racial divide, shows that compared with Black civilians, Black service members fare better on numerous metrics, including household income and homeownership rates.</p>



<p>As a result, many Black people, especially women, see enlisting in the military as one of the clearest routes to a better life. Even though Black people account for roughly 14 percent of the U.S. population, <a href="https://download.militaryonesource.mil/12038/MOS/Reports/2020-demographics-report.pdf">over 17 percent of active duty service members are Black</a>. And Black women make up 26 percent of female active duty service members.</p>



<p>Enlisting in the military for opportunity involves a trade-off, though, Williams says. She credits the institution with instilling in her a discipline and drive to get ahead in life. But she also acknowledges the loss of autonomy. In the military, she says, “your time is never really your time because you’re always on Uncle Sam’s clock.”</p>

<h4>Baked-in segregation</h4>



<p>Some years before the military integrated the troops, Vince Mereday, a Black U.S. sailor who served during World War II, passed his pilot’s test while stationed at the Great Lakes Naval Training Center outside Chicago. But Black service members at Great Lakes were forbidden from attending flight training. So Mereday worked as a mechanic during the war, recounts race and ethnicity scholar Richard Rothstein in his 2017 book <em>The Color of Law: A Forgotten History of How Our Government Segregated America</em>.</p>



<p>Discrimination against Black people persisted even after the war. At the time, real estate developer William Levitt was building his namesake Long Island, N.Y., suburb for returning veterans. Mereday’s uncle received a contract to deliver drywall to the Levittown construction site. Yet the developer denied Mereday’s application to buy his own home there; so instead, he bought a house in a predominantly Black suburb near Levittown, called Lakeview.</p>



<p>Mereday was the victim of segregationist housing practices that seeped into official government policy in the early 1930s. Vowing to lift the nation out of the Great Depression, President Franklin Roosevelt created a new federal agency called the Home Owners’ Loan Corporation, or HOLC, to address the country’s foreclosure crisis.</p>



<p>Agency appraisers traversed the country ranking neighborhoods from A to D, in increasing order of perceived foreclosure risk, to determine who could receive loans. In the resulting color-coded maps, A neighborhoods were green, B neighborhoods were blue and C neighborhoods were yellow. The presence of Black families all but guaranteed that a neighborhood would receive a D grade. Those D neighborhoods were depicted in red — hence the term “redlining,” a discriminatory practice in which mortgage lenders deny home loan applications based on the racial or ethnic characteristics of applicants’ neighborhoods. In 1930s St. Louis, for example, none of the city’s roughly 94,000 Black residents lived outside a neighborhood that received a D grade.</p>



<p>“It wasn’t good enough to just be a white neighborhood to get a good grade. The appraisers had to believe that there was no risk of integration,” says sociologist Jacob Faber of New York University, who <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/0003122420948464">documented that history</a> in 2020 in the <em>American Sociological Review</em>. “‘Infiltration’ was actually the term that they used.”</p>



<p>The color-coded maps would later underpin larger federal housing programs, including loans issued through the Federal Housing Administration and the Department of Veterans Affairs.</p>



<p>Mereday and other Black service members were stuck. Levitt wouldn’t allow Mereday to buy a home in Levittown, in part because by integrating his new development, Levitt would have lost his federal government subsidies, Rothstein writes. But because Mereday bought a home in a predominantly Black, “risky” suburb, he couldn’t get a zero–down payment, low-interest VA loan.</p>



<p>“His experiences of discrimination in the Navy and in the housing market permanently embittered him,” Rothstein writes.</p>

<h4>A case study in desegregation</h4>



<p>Had Mereday been born a generation later, his quest for a home might have ended differently. On July 26, 1948, President Harry Truman issued Executive Order 9981, which effectively mandated that the armed forces integrate. The move was, in part, politically expedient. Truman was running for re-election in a heated race against Thomas Dewey, who had a good record on civil rights issues. Truman hoped integrating the military would woo Black and other minority voters.</p>



<p>The scheme was well-timed. By the early 1950s, the United States was at war with North Korea and needed racial unity within the troops. By the war’s end, the U.S. Army reported that 90 percent of Black soldiers were serving in integrated units.</p>



<p>But back home, once they stepped off base, Black service members still had to contend with local prejudices. At one base in the Deep South, for example, Black service members riding a public bus on the base had to move to the back of the vehicle once it crossed into the city. Restaurant and shop owners could refuse to serve Black service members. And local school systems placed Black service members’ children in segregated schools.</p>



<p>The military largely followed local practices on housing. When community members and landlords objected to housing Black service members in neighborhoods close to base, commanders went along.</p>



<p>But by the mid-1960s, the military began prioritizing national security, and by extension, racial integration, over local concerns. “The [military’s] intent was not necessarily noble. The intent was manpower readiness,” says sociologist and demographer Jennifer Lundquist of the University of Massachusetts Amherst.</p>



<p>From 1967 to 1968, the Department of Defense implemented a program called Nondiscriminatory Housing for Military Personnel to get U.S. landlords to rent to all service members, regardless of race. Local military leaders first surveyed off-base housing in their area to see how many landlords were already in adherence with the program. The effort revealed that about 60 percent of 25,000 rental units surveyed were open to Black and brown tenants.</p>



<p>When discriminatory landlords did not respond to “gentler” compliance methods, military leaders hit them with an ultimatum: Rent to all soldiers, or rent to none. With many military bases serving as the largest employer in town, landlords who refused to comply risked going out of business, Lundquist says.</p>



<p>The military’s approach worked. By August 1968, landlords for 90 percent of the facilities surveyed had pledged, in writing, to rent to service members of all races.</p>

<h4>Black civilians</h4>



<p>In the civilian world, however, 1960s civil rights legislation aimed at ending discrimination in employment, education and housing — policies that, at least on paper, resembled those in the military — largely stalled. “Almost all the civil rights legislation was very weak on enforcement,” says sociologist Doug Massey of Princeton University.</p>



<p>In housing, for example, “HOLC’s practices of racial exclusion were adopted by subsequent federal programs, which were larger and more durable,” Faber wrote in his 2020 report in <em>American Sociological Review</em>. “Most notable among these were the Federal Housing Administration (FHA) and the GI Bill.” Between 1950 and 1960, he noted, the two “massive” programs financed a third of privately owned housing units, and played a big hand in boosting the U.S. homeownership rate from 44 percent in 1934 to 63 percent in 1972.</p>



<p>Consequently, many white families, which typically have easier access to home loans, have been building wealth for decades, creating a growing racial wealth divide, says Anne Price, president of the Insight Center for Community Economic Development, an organization in Oakland, Calif., dedicated to economic justice. “Wealth begets wealth.”</p>



<p>In 2019, the median white family’s net worth hovered at $188,200, <a href="https://www.brookings.edu/blog/up-front/2020/12/08/the-black-white-wealth-gap-left-black-households-more-vulnerable/">almost eight times as high as the median Black family’s net worth of $24,100</a>, the Brookings Institution, a Washington D.C.–based nonprofit public policy organization, reported in 2020. That wealth gap links to wide racial gaps in homeownership. For example, in 2019, some 73 percent of white, non-Hispanic people owned their homes compared with about 42 percent of Black people.</p>



<p>Homeowners still receive government support not typically available to renters, such as tax breaks, Price says. “These are policies that help people maintain and build wealth. They are geared toward high-income earners, people who have homes of high value. Those people tend to be white people.”</p>



<p><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/why-some-low-income-neighborhoods-are-better-others">Redlining’s legacy</a> also means that homes in Black neighborhoods appreciate more slowly than homes in white neighborhoods (<em>SN: 5/11/19 &amp; 5/25/19, p. 16</em>). Consider the trajectories of Levittown and Mereday’s Lakeview neighborhood. With Levittown houses selling for at least $350,000 nearly five years ago when Rothstein published his book, white families who bought homes there in 1948 had accrued, on average, over $200,000 in wealth. Black families who bought in Lakeview, meanwhile, gained no more than $45,000 during that time.</p>



<p>Residents in predominantly Black towns like Lakeview were also hit hard by the 2008 housing crisis. Massey has documented how mortgage brokers had previously targeted buyers in predominantly Black neighborhoods for subprime loans, which came with high interest rates and fees. That caused many more Black families to face foreclosure on their homes than white families.</p>



<p>Faber wondered what would have happened if that history, starting with HOLC and up to the present, had never transpired. What if the federal government had instead sought to break up the de facto segregation that characterized many U.S. neighborhoods in the 1930s by prioritizing loans for Black people?</p>



<p>Faber’s calculations showed that in actual 2010, over a third of people in HOLC-appraised cities would have had to move for integration to occur. But in the alternate universe of Faber’s model, less than a quarter of people would have had to move for that same outcome.</p>



<p>Similarly, in real-life 2010, almost 5 million Black people lived in cities in which almost 70 percent of residents would have had to move to integrate neighborhoods. Under an antiracist policy, highly segregated cities would not exist.</p>



<p>Public policies entrenched segregation in the United States, Faber says. But he sees an upside. “We know what we did to segregate, so we know, in a way, how to desegregate.”</p>



<h4>Attitude changes</h4>



<p>By the 1980s, results of the military’s experiment in integration were becoming apparent. In 1994, researchers reported in the <em>American Sociological Review </em>that <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/2096131?origin=crossref">military communities had the lowest levels of segregation</a> in the country.</p>



<p>Since then, researchers have shown that military service seems to foster <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27712689/">long-term changes in racial attitudes</a>. Soldiers report that relations are better in the military than in civilian society; service members have higher rates of interracial marriage than civilians; and white and Black veterans alike live in more diverse neighborhoods than their civilian peers.</p>



<p>Lundquist and others attribute many veterans’ increased comfort with diversity to a half-century-old theory known as the “contact hypothesis.” Formalized by Harvard University psychologist Gordon Allport in the 1950s, the hypothesis has a simple premise: Social interaction across groups can reduce prejudices.</p>



<p>Testing that theory in the civilian world has proved difficult, however, as Black and white people often occupy different residential, social and workplace niches. “Segregation essentially prevents that sort of contact from happening,” Massey says.</p>



<p>The military’s push to integrate has turned the institution into an ideal testing ground, Lundquist says. Service members of different races and ethnicities regularly interact — in the mess hall, in the barracks and in their neighborhoods. And now Lundquist’s research and that of others suggests that those interactions persist across time.</p>



<p>To be sure, social contact among members of different races, and the accompanying changes in attitude, cannot completely erase racial disparities. Black service members and veterans fare better than Black civilians on multiple metrics, including homeownership rates and income, but they have yet to attain parity with white service members.</p>



<p>For instance, in 2017, the median income for Black non-veterans in the United States was $50,300 compared with $77,400 for Black veterans, according to the U.S. Census Bureau’s American Community Survey. But the median income for white veterans was $93,800.</p>



<p>Yet racial contact in military towns has helped lift everyone in those communities, Massey says. “That [contact] is the formula for moderating the color line.” Black civilians living in military towns enjoy slightly higher incomes and homeownership rates compared with Black people living in other parts of the country, according to a 2021 report by the Urban Institute, a nonprofit economic and social policy research organization in Washington, D.C. The military is often the largest employer in these military towns and cities, thus providing good jobs to all people living in the vicinity, says Jung Hyun Choi, an expert on racial equity in housing at the Urban Institute. “Our question, of course, is: Can a private employer provide these same benefits?”</p>



<h4>Dreams expand</h4>



<p>Williams, who served in the military for a decade, never intended to leave. “I was supposed to go the distance,” she says.</p>



<p>But then both she and her husband, Charles, deployed to Iraq, forcing them to leave their then 6-month-old son in the care of her mother. When their daughter was born two years later, Williams knew she couldn’t endure another deployment. “If it weren’t for my babies and wanting to really, really put time and effort into my kids, I would have stayed,” Williams says. “I mourned my career for at least two years after getting out.”</p>



<p>Two years later, Charles, who is also Black and who also intended to go the distance, left the Army. After years in harm’s way, he had developed post-traumatic stress disorder. But Williams says he left for other reasons. With so many stints overseas, he could not pursue the education he needed to move up the ranks. “He got looked over for a promotion,” she says.</p>

<p>That story is familiar for many Black service members. In 2020, while over 18 percent of enlistees were Black, only about 9 percent of officers were Black, the Department of Defense reports. Attendance at the prestigious military schools that pave the way to higher-ranking positions remains predominantly white, and military leaders often push Black service members toward specializations with <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/25/us/politics/military-minorities-leadership.html">less promotion potential</a>, the <em>New York Times </em>reported in 2020.</p>



<p>After two years of searching, Charles found a job as a military contractor, with more stints overseas. He returned in January from his 12th overseas assignment, in Djibouti in eastern Africa.</p>



<p>For Faber, stories like that of Amber and Charles Williams illustrate the potentially steep cost of pursuing opportunity through the military. “Why can’t we offer these things without the severe risk of death or trauma?” he asks.</p>



<p>Amber acknowledges the costs but says she has no regrets. She and Charles purchased their second home in 2010, also using a VA loan. That was the dream home at the time, Williams says, but those dreams have since grown. “Now that I live here, it’s not my dream home. We are looking to buy again!” she says via text. She has also reached a level of professional success she never expected. With her personal training business going well, she launched a mobile juice company in 2021.</p>



<p>“I was on track to stay right there with my mom in that mobile home,” Williams says. “I do feel like I’ve arrived. I really do. My kids are being raised differently, and we don’t have to live paycheck to paycheck.”</p>

<p>For a brief moment in history, the United States seemed like it might follow the U.S. military’s path to integration. In 1968, on the heels of Martin Luther King Jr.’s assassination and subsequent protests, Congress passed the Fair Housing Act.</p>



<p>Although political leaders saw the act’s passage as largely symbolic, the man tasked with enforcing it saw otherwise. George Romney, father of Sen. Mitt Romney of Utah, was President Richard Nixon’s Housing and Urban Development secretary. In that role, Romney sought to bring Black city dwellers into the nation’s white suburbs through two policies, a public one known as Operation Breakthrough and a clandestine one known as Open Communities.</p>



<p>The purpose of Operation Breakthrough was to build affordable housing in the suburbs — a goal that merely alluded to Romney’s larger integrationist goals. Internal memos, though, reveal that Open Communities was actively integrationist. “The white suburban noose around the black in the city core is morally wrong, economically in­efficient, socially destructive, and politically explosive,” John C. Chapin, Romney’s special assistant, wrote in a 1969 memo.</p>



<p>The Open Communities Task Force targeted suburbs, such as Warren, Mich., for integration. In 1970, the Detroit suburb was home to 179,260 residents, of whom 132 were Black. When Warren officials balked at building more affordable housing, Romney borrowed from the military playbook: He threatened to withhold HUD water and sewer grants. “You can try to hermetically seal Warren off from the surrounding areas if you want to, but you won’t do it with federal money,” Romney reportedly said.</p>



<p>Nixon eventually forced Romney to back down to avoid alienating his suburban voting base. The big stick approach that overhauled race relations in the military spelled Romney’s downfall. He resigned in 1972.</p>



<p>For his radical vision, Romney “got railroaded out of the administration,” says sociologist Doug Massey of Princeton University. <em>— Sujata Gupta</em></p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/quantum-boomerang-effect-seen-first-time">The quantum ‘boomerang’ effect has been seen for the first time</a></h4>

              
                <p>Some quantum particles gotta get right back to where they started from.</p>



<p>Physicists have confirmed a theoretically predicted phenomenon called the quantum boomerang effect. An experiment reveals that, after being given a nudge, <a href="https://journals.aps.org/prx/accepted/a7075K5fW5914a0f64f897626abd036fb92cf606f">particles in certain materials return to their starting points, on average</a>, researchers report in a paper accepted in <em>Physical Review X</em>.</p>



<p>Particles can boomerang if they’re in a material that has lots of disorder. Instead of a pristine material made up of orderly arranged atoms, the material must have many defects, such as atoms that are missing or misaligned, or other types of atoms sprinkled throughout.</p>



<p>In 1958, physicist Philip Anderson realized that with enough disorder, <a href="https://journals.aps.org/pr/abstract/10.1103/PhysRev.109.1492">electrons in a material become localized</a>: They get stuck in place, unable to travel very far from where they started. The pinned-down electrons prevent the material from conducting electricity, thereby turning what might otherwise be a metal into an insulator. That localization is also necessary for the boomerang effect.</p>





<p>To picture the boomerang in action, physicist David Weld of the University of California, Santa Barbara imagines shrinking himself down and slipping inside a disordered material. If he tries to fling away an electron, he says, “it will not only turn around and come straight back to me, it’ll come right back to me and stop.” (Actually, he says, in this sense the electron is “more like a dog than a boomerang.” The boomerang will keep going past you if you don’t catch it, but a well-trained dog will sit by your side.)</p>



<p>Weld and colleagues demonstrated this effect using ultracold lithium atoms as stand-ins for the electrons. Instead of looking for atoms returning to their original position, the team studied the analogous situation for momentum, because that was relatively straightforward to create in the lab. The atoms were initially stationary, but after being given kicks from lasers to give them momenta, the atoms returned, on average, to their original standstill states, making a momentum boomerang.</p>





<p>The team also determined what’s needed to break the boomerang. To work, the boomerang effect requires time-reversal symmetry, meaning that the particles should behave the same when time runs forward as they would on rewind. By changing the timing of the first kick from the lasers so that the kicking pattern was off-kilter, the researchers broke time-reversal symmetry, and the boomerang effect disappeared, as predicted.</p>



<p>“I was so happy,” says Patrizia Vignolo, a coauthor of the study. “It was perfect agreement” with their theoretical calculations, says Vignolo, a theoretical physicist at Université Côte d&#8217;Azur based in Valbonne, France.</p>



<p>Even though Anderson made his discovery about localized particles more than 60 years ago, the quantum boomerang effect is a recent newcomer to physics. “Nobody thought about it, apparently, probably because it’s very counterintuitive,” says physicist Dominique Delande of CNRS and Kastler Brossel Laboratory in Paris, who <a href="https://journals.aps.org/pra/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevA.99.023629">predicted the effect with colleagues in 2019</a>.</p>



<p>The weird effect is the result of quantum physics. Quantum particles <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/antimatter-quantum-theory-particle-wave-double-slit-experiment">act like waves</a>, with ripples that can add and subtract in complicated ways (<em>SN: 5/3/19</em>). Those waves combine to enhance the trajectory that returns a particle to its origin and cancel out paths that go off in other directions. “This is a pure quantum effect,” Delande says, “so it has no equivalent in classical physics.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2022/02/08/does-vr-give-you-motion-sickness-try-chewing-some-gum/">Does VR give you motion sickness? Try chewing some gum</a></h4>

              
                <p><em>By</em> <a href="https://emmayoung.net/">Emma Young</a></p>



<p>VR headsets are becoming commonplace not only in entertainment and pilot training, but in clinical settings — in helping people to overcome phobias, for example, or to distract burns patients while their dressings are changed. Unfortunately, there’s a common side effect: visually induced motion sickness (VIMS), sometimes also known as &#8220;cybersickness&#8221;. This limits the use of VR, or means that people have to spend extended periods feeling nauseous while they adapt to it. But according to <a href="https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s00221-021-06303-5.pdf">new research</a> in <em>Experimental Brain Research</em> there’s a very simple way to tackle this problem: chewing flavoured gum.</p>



<span id="more-45313"></span>



<p>Mara Kaufeld at the Fraunhofer Institute for Communication, Information Processing and Ergonomics in Bonn, Germany and her colleagues studied 77 healthy adults, who each completed a 15-minute simulated search and rescue helicopter flight using a head-mounted VR set. One group was given peppermint flavoured gum to chew during the flight, a second was given ginger-flavoured gum, and a control group had no gum.</p>



<p>Before the flight and also afterwards, each participant completed a VIMS scale, which asked about various symptoms, including headaches, nausea and eyestrain. Every minute of the flight, they also reported verbally on any feelings of sickness. And the results were clear: chewing either of the gums led to significantly lower peak sickness scores while flying. The gum-chewers also reported less disorientation on the post-flight VIMS assessment.</p>



<p>What explains the findings? Both gums were deemed to have a pretty pleasant taste, but the team found that the higher the pleasantness ratings, the milder the VIMS symptoms. So perhaps positive emotions generated by the pleasant taste helped to combat feelings of sickness.</p>



<p>But the physical act of chewing was probably important, too. Motion sickness is thought to be caused by a mismatch between signals from the eyes and from the vestibular system, which senses head movement. If your eyes are telling your brain that you’re moving but your vestibular system is maintaining that your head is still — as in the case of a VR helicopter flight — this leads to nausea. (Why should the conflict trigger nausea? One theory is that because some poisons affect the vestibular system, the brain assumes that this is what’s happened — and you feel sick.)</p>



<p>But if chewing gum physically stimulates the mastoid region — a region of the skull just below and behind the ear — this could trigger vestibular signals, which the brain would recognise as unhelpful &#8220;noise&#8221;, rather than useful information about head movement. This could lead it to temporarily demote vestibular signals, and to rely more on what the eyes are saying, which would lessen the sensory conflict — and mean less VIMS. That’s the theory, at least. But it’s certainly supported by findings from other studies.</p>



<p>Unfortunately, the team didn’t include a group that was given flavourless gum, however, so they can’t tell how much of the reduction in VIMS was down to the pleasant taste of the gum, and how much down to the action of chewing. As they note, chewing might also work as a distractor, and reduce feelings of sickness in that way, too. But there’s also another potential mechanism: as we’ve reported before,<a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2019/05/08/exploratory-research-identifies-a-novel-way-to-beat-anxiety-zapping-the-vestibular-system/"> rhythmic vestibular signals are calming</a> — and perhaps this might have an effect, too.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Might chewing gum also help with non-VR types of motion sickness? Only more research will tell, as car-sickness, for example, involves a reverse conflict: the vestibular system is maintaining that the head is moving — while for someone who is reading, or watching a screen, the eyes are saying that the body is still.</p>



<p>For now, though there are other ways to address VIMS, they all have downsides, the team argues. “Our results validate the use of chewing gum as an easy-to-use countermeasure against VIMS with great acceptance and entirely free of the side-effects associated with more potent medications,” they write. This is also one of those rare conclusions that no one has to wait for a new pill, product or carefully designed intervention to potentially benefit from. If you need to use VR at work, or elsewhere, it’s hard to think of a reason not to give gum a try.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://vanessa-kris.github.io/a-story-about-python-and-c.html">A Story About Python And C.</a></h4>

              
                <p>Hello...</p>
<p>Let's talk a little about Python and C</p>
<h2>A little back story</h2>
<p>So I was asked "what's the difference between python and C?" and I was like what?? I actually do not know!!! Then i did a little research and... let's find out what I learnt.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Python is a multi-paradigm language and C is a structural programming language. Python is a general purpose language that is used for machine learning, natural language processing, web development and many more, C is mainly used for hardware related application development such as operating systems and network drivers.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Python has very fewer keywords and more English language syntax whereas C is far more difficult to write and maintain.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Python is much slower than C, Python takes significant CPU time for interpretation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Python is a an interpreted language while C is a compiled language.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>What is a compiled and an interpreted language??</p>
<p>Compiled Language 
Compiled languages are converted directly into machine code that the processor can execute. As a result, they tend to be faster and more efficient to execute than interpreted languages. They also give the developer more control over hardware aspects like CPU usage.</p>
<p>Interpreted Language
This runs through a program line by line and execute each command.</p>
<ul>
<li>Python is dynamically typed while C is statically typed.</li>
</ul>
<p>Static Typing
Static type checks are performed without running the program. This is done as your program is compiled. The type of variable is not allowed to change over it's lifetime.</p>
<p>Dynamic Typing
Python is a dynamically typed language. This means that the Python interpreter does type checking only as code runs, and the type of a variable is allowed to change over its lifetime.</p>
<ul>
<li>Python is a strongly typed language while C is weakly typed.</li>
</ul>
<p>Weakly typed languages make conversions between unrelated types implicitly; whereas, strongly typed languages don’t allow implicit conversions between unrelated types.</p>
<p>According to Fedora Packaging Python packages have different requirements from C let's take a quick look:</p>
<h2>Python packages</h2>
<p>Every package that uses Python (at runtime and/or build time) and/or installs Python modules MUST explicitly include BuildRequires: python3-devel in its .spec file, even if Python is not actually invoked during build time.</p>
<p>Mandatory macros</p>
<p>The following macros MUST be used where applicable.</p>
<p>The expansions in parentheses are provided only as reference/examples.</p>
<p>The macros are defined for you in all supported Fedora and EPEL versions.</p>
<p>%{python3} (/usr/bin/python3): The Python interpreter. For example, this macro should be used for invoking Python from a spec file script, passed to configure scripts to select a Python executable, or used as %{python3} -m pip to run a Python-based tool.</p>
<p>If the packaged software invokes Python at run time (as opposed to running Python to build/test it), it might be necessary to pass flags to %{python3} to isolate it from user-installed packages. See Shebangs for details.</p>
<p>%{python3_version} (e.g. 3.9, 3.10): Version of the Python interpreter.</p>
<p>%{python3_version_nodots} (e.g. 39, 310): Version of the Python interpreter without the dot.</p>
<p>%{python3_sitelib} (e.g. /usr/lib/python3.9/site-packages): Where pure-Python modules are installed.</p>
<p>%{python3_sitearch} (e.g. /usr/lib64/python3.9/site-packages): Where Python extension modules (native code, e.g. compiled from C) are installed.</p>
<p>Packages MUST include the source file (<em>.py) AND the bytecode cache (</em>.pyc) for each pure-Python importable module. The source files MUST be included in the same package as the bytecode cache.</p>
<p>Each Python package MUST include Package Distribution Metadata conforming to PyPA specifications (specifically, Recording installed distributons).</p>
<p>Packages MUST NOT own shared directories owned by Python itself, such as the top-level <strong>pycache</strong> directories (%{python3_sitelib}/<strong>pycache</strong>, %{python3_sitearch}/<strong>pycache</strong>).
<a href="https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/packaging-guidelines/Python/">Read more</a></p>
<h2>C</h2>
<p>I haven't had much experience in building C packages so far but; If your application is a C or C++ application you must list a BuildRequires against gcc, gcc-c++ or clang. Those packages will include everything that is required to build a standards conforming C or C++ application.</p>
<p>Other languages Fedora packages uses for packaging are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Ada </li>
<li>C++ </li>
<li>D </li>
<li>Fotran </li>
<li>Golang </li>
<li>Haskell </li>
<li>Java </li>
<li>JavaScript </li>
<li>Lisp </li>
<li>Mono </li>
<li>Node.js </li>
<li>Ocaml </li>
<li>Octave </li>
<li>Perl </li>
<li>PHP </li>
<li>R </li>
<li>Ruby </li>
<li>Rust </li>
<li>Tcl/Tk extensions.</li>
</ul>

              <h4><a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2022/02/07/feelings-of-awe-may-motivate-us-to-become-our-authentic-selves/">Feelings of awe may motivate us to become our “authentic” selves</a></h4>

              
                <p><em>By</em> <a href="https://emmayoung.net/">Emma Young</a></p>



<p>Awe has to be one of the hottest emotions in psychological research. Here at the <em>Digest</em>, we’ve covered all kinds of recent work on everything from <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2020/10/19/awe-walks-can-boost-positive-emotions-among-older-adults/">the benefits of awe walks</a> to the <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2021/11/25/a-sad-kind-of-happiness-the-role-of-mixed-emotions-in-our-lives/">mixed emotion of threat-awe</a>. Now a <a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/fulltext/2022-06386-001.html">new paper</a> argues that awe “awakens self-transcendence”, helping people to get closer to their true, &#8220;authentic&#8221; self.</p>



<span id="more-45307"></span>



<p>Awe is often defined as the feeling you get when you’re in the presence of something vast that challenges your view of the world, and your place in it. The &#8220;authentic self&#8221; is who you truly are — taking into account your goals, aspirations and values.</p>



<p>Tonglin Jiang at Peking University and Constantine Sedikides report no fewer than 14 studies on a total of more than 4,400 people in the <em>Journal of Personality and Social Psychology: Interpersonal Relations and Group Processes</em>. In early studies, they found that a person’s level of predisposition to feeling awe (to &#8220;feeling wonder&#8221; almost every day, for example) was linked to how much they wanted to get closer to their authentic self. This was assessed using a scale that measured &#8220;authentic-self pursuit&#8221;.</p>



<p>In another study, the pair tried encouraging feelings of awe in some of their participants, by using images of the Northern Lights, for example, as well as by getting them to remember times in their lives when they perceived vastness and adjusted their worldview as a result. They found that people in this group had higher scores on the authentic-self pursuit scale than a control group who had seen scenes of daily life. They interpret this as suggesting that the experience of awe encourages a desire to get closer to the authentic self.</p>



<p>Jiang and Sedikides then explored potential links with self-transcendence — feeling an expansion or dissolution of the hard boundary of the self, and a sense of unity with the wider world; this can have spiritual connotations, though it does not have to. In studies on Chinese and also American participants, the pair found that people with higher dispositional awe also had greater self-transcendence scores — and this helped to explain why these people showed a stronger pursuit of the authentic self. (This was especially true for the Chinese participants, they note.)</p>



<p>In their final set of studies, the researchers found that, as before, feelings of awe were linked to higher authentic-self pursuit scores, but also that these scores were in turn linked to stronger pro-social feelings. These were assessed using a scale that asked participants about feelings of wanting to take care of people in need, for example.</p>



<p>Earlier research has linked feeling awe to all kinds of benefits, both for the individual person, and society — such as greater wellbeing and reduced daily stress, as well as increased compassion, gratitude and love. Based on their new findings, “self-transcendence or self-transcendence followed by authentic-self pursuit may be the underlying mechanisms,” Jiang and Sedikides write.</p>



<p>They also reference recent work finding that not all types of awe are positive, however. It’s possible that threat-awe works differently — and wouldn’t encourage self-transcendence and more prosocial feelings.</p>



<p>A lot of this new work is suggestive, rather than conclusive, it has to be said. But if positive types of awe do motivate people to be more in touch with who they &#8220;are&#8221; — with all the benefits that brings — this would fit with an endeavour that had become a cliché even by the time I was a student. People who take gap years or sabbaticals to &#8220;find themselves&#8221; are likely to find themselves the butt of some ribbing… but if that travel gives them awe-inspiring experiences, then this work suggests that it really could bring them closer to their true selves.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/genetics-history-mendel-dna-yafeng-shan">How we got from Gregor Mendel’s pea plants to modern genetics</a></h4>

              
                <p>The year was 1900. Three European botanists — one Dutch, one German and one Austrian — all reported results from breeding experiments in plants. Each claimed that they had independently discovered some remarkable patterns in inheritance that had been noticed by Gregor Mendel decades earlier and reported in “Versuche über Pflanzen-Hybriden,” or “Experiments in Plant Hybridization.” All three relied on or built upon the work of the Austrian monk, whose experiments in pea plants are famous today as the foundation of genetics.</p>



<p>Yet at the time, “there was no such discipline as genetics, nor was there a concept of the gene,” says Yafeng Shan, a philosopher of science at the University of Kent in England. Instead, there were many theories of how traits were inherited, including Charles Darwin’s theory of pangenesis, which described particles of inheritance called “gemmules” thought to be given off by all cells in the body and to collect in the reproductive organs.</p>



<p>From the muddle of ideas, Shan says, those three reports at the dawn of the 20th century helped introduce Mendel’s work to other scientists in the fledgling field of heredity. That set the stage for the development of Mendelian genetics as we know it today, and no doubt played into a century’s worth of developments in molecular biology, from the <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/way-life-handed">discovery of the structure of DNA</a> to the sequencing of the human genome and the rise of genetic engineering.</p>

<p>But the path to our current understanding of the inheritance and variation at the heart of modern biology has been far more winding than most biology textbooks reveal. In the conversation that follows, Elizabeth Quill, special projects editor at <em>Science News</em>, talks with Shan about the origins of genetics and what progress over the past century tells us about the nature of science.</p>



<p><strong>Quill: Our understanding of genetics has emerged nearly entirely in the last century. Can you take us back? What did scientists know at the beginning of the century?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Shan:</strong> The term <em>genetics</em> was coined to describe the study of heredity in 1905 by the English biologist William Bateson in a letter to his friend. The term <em>gene</em> was introduced later, in 1909, by the Danish biologist Wilhelm Johannsen to refer to the unit of hereditary material.</p>



<p>That said, there were at least 30 different theories of heredity or inheritance at the beginning of the 20th century. So to borrow Charles Dickens’ phrase: It was the best of times, and it was the worst of times for the study of heredity. There were many different theories, methods and lines of inquiry available, but there was no consensus on the mechanism and patterns of inheritance, nor was there any consensus on a reliable way to study them.</p>



<p><strong>Quill: In biology classes, we learn that Gregor Mendel’s experiments breeding pea plants in the mid-19th century taught us that inherited traits are delivered to offspring on pairs of genes, one from each parent, and that there are dominant and recessive forms of genes. But if the concept of gene wasn’t fully developed in Mendel’s day, what did his work actually reveal?</strong></p>

<p><strong>Shan:</strong> If you walk into any university library and pick up a copy of a genetics textbook today, you may find the following narrative: Mendel developed a theory of inheritance, but unfortunately, the theory was neglected or overlooked for over three decades, and only rediscovered in 1900.</p>



<p>Actually, there are mistakes in that: Mendel’s theory was not a theory of inheritance. He never used the German word for heredity — <em>Vererbung</em>. His concern was instead about the development of hybrids. In other words, Mendel did propose a theory for patterns of characteristics in plant hybrids, but it is not a theory of inheritance. And Mendel’s theory was not neglected or overlooked. There were more than a dozen citations to his paper before 1900. That’s not a lot, but definitely not overlooked.</p>



<p>Some fascinating things did happen in 1900, though. Mendel&#8217;s work was introduced to the study of heredity by Hugo de Vries, Carl Correns and Erich von Tschermak. All of them renewed Mendel’s work for different purposes. That being said, none of these three became a pioneer of Mendelism as we know it today.</p>



<p><strong>Quill: Who was that pioneer?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Shan:</strong> After the introduction of Mendel’s work to the study of heredity, one important pioneer was William Bateson, an English biologist. Originally, he was not interested in the problem of heredity. So, to some extent, he was an outsider. He was studying evolution, but he found Mendel’s work useful. Based on Mendel’s findings, he said, we can develop a new theory that is the correct way to study heredity and will further shed light on the nature of evolution. He was one of the most prominent figures in the movement, which at first was resisted by many people.</p>

<p>To cut the story short, Mendelism won the victory — though in the early days, it was quite different from the Mendelian genetics of today, which was mainly established and developed by T.H. Morgan and his students and team at Columbia.</p>



<p><strong>Quill: Thomas H. Morgan isn’t as widely known as Mendel or Darwin, for example. Why was his work so important and what made it different from what came before?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Shan:</strong> He may not have become a household name, but Morgan is considered one of the most influential geneticists ever. He actually began his career as a zoologist and had diverse interests in morphology, regeneration, embryology, et cetera. He was using fruit flies as experimental organisms to test the Darwinian theory of evolution. Darwin believed evolution happened through a series of minor and gradual changes. Others, including de Vries, believed species evolved through mutations: radical, sudden change. Morgan bought that argument.</p>



<p>Initially, his work was not very successful, in his own words. He started his experiment in 1908 and found nothing at all until 1910. He mentioned to an office friend that it was two years’ time, just wasted. But sometimes magical things just happen. After two years, he was surprised to find a mutation.</p>



<p>But he was puzzled. This mutation that he observed could not be explained by de Vries’ theory of mutation. Rather, it could be better accounted for by the Mendelian approach. So here is where Morgan and his team began developing a Mendelian approach.</p>



<p>What Morgan did differently from early Mendelians, say Bateson, was that he and his team incorporated Mendelism with another important line of inquiry in the field, the chromosome theory of inheritance, which was developed primarily by American geneticist Walter Sutton and German zoologist Theodor Boveri. They came up with the idea that hereditary material must be somewhere within the chromosomes. That provided a physical basis for hereditary material.</p>



<p><strong>Quill: And that must have proved successful?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Shan:</strong> Combining Mendelism and the chromosome theory of inheritance leads to one of the most remarkable achievements of Morgan and his colleagues: They produced the chromosome map for the fruit fly. They located different genes at different locations on the chromosome. With that map, you can calculate the frequency of recombination of genes in the following generations. With that single map, you can identify not only the position of the genes on the chromosomes, but also predict the phenomenon of inheritance.</p>

<p><strong>Quill: We haven’t yet talked about DNA. Were geneticists interested in DNA at that time?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Shan:</strong> The study of DNA was part of the job of biochemists. DNA was first identified in the mid-19th century, roughly the same time as when Mendel was working on his peas. Swiss chemist Friedrich Miescher was looking for the most fundamental constituents of life. He identified some substance coming from the nucleus of the cell and named it “nuclein.” That is what we now call DNA.</p>



<p>After his great discovery, the importance of and implications of nuclein, or DNA, were debated for decades. By the turn of the 20th century, nuclein was identified as a nucleic acid, and the five bases of nucleic acids — G, A, C, T and U — were also identified. In the 1920s and ’30s, biochemists came to know that the nucleic acid present in chromosomes is DNA.</p>



<p>But the makeup of DNA was only being pursued by biochemists. Those who studied the problem of heredity did not pay serious attention to DNA until the 1940s.</p>



<p><strong>Quill: How did DNA get incorporated into the study of heredity?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Shan:</strong> That is the process of merging of the two lines of inquiry — the line of inquiry in genetics and the line of inquiry in biochemistry. For geneticists, their main concern was about a pattern and mechanism of inheritance and how a particular trait is transmitted from generation to generation. And on the other hand, biochemists were looking for the physical foundations of life.</p>



<p>With the success of T.H. Morgan and his colleagues, geneticists had a better capacity to predict and explain the patterns of inheritance. Then an immediate question arose: So, what are genes?</p>



<p>According to the Morgan school of classical genetics, a gene is just a segment of the chromosome. That’s very easy. There was very popular analogy in which they described genes as beads on the string. But it was still quite unclear what the physical basis was. &nbsp;</p>



<p>Oswald Avery and his colleagues reported evidence in 1944 that DNA, rather than protein, carries hereditary information. Even though Avery’s experiment was not actually the first — it was confirming work done by others in 1939 — his work was better received and better known within the community. People often refer to Avery’s great experiment, though at the time some skepticism remained.</p>





<p><strong>Quill: That background helps explain why the discovery of the double-helix structure of DNA, from James Watson and Francis Crick, along with Rosalind Franklin and Maurice Wilkins, was so monumental. By knowing the structure of DNA, people could think about how the physical process of inheritance might work. Is that right?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Shan:</strong> Today we say, ‘Ah, so the process of inheritance is quite straightforward: Basically, DNA can be transcribed to RNA, and RNA can be translated into protein, and protein is responsible for phenotypic traits.’ Roughly speaking, it is like that.</p>



<p>That double-helix model provided a very reliable and useful framework to study DNA replication, and transcription. That&#8217;s crucially important for the later work in molecular genetics. At the time, in 1953, when Watson and Crick proposed that model, their work was not immediately well-received. It was not cited a lot — just like Mendel’s paper — until the end of the 1950s, when other work confirmed that the structure of DNA provides a mechanism of controlling protein synthesis.</p>



<p>There are quite a lot of important discoveries that followed. It’s probably unfair, but from my point of view, the others aren’t as exciting as the discovery of the double helix. If I can borrow a phrase from American philosopher Thomas Kuhn, we are now in the period of <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/blog/context/replacing-paradigms-requires-open-minds">“normal science,” or what he calls “mopping up.”</a> It took another 40 or 50 years to get where we are now, but in terms of milestones in the history of genetics, if you ask me if there’s anything as important as the introduction of Mendel’s work and the discovery of the double helix, I would say I’m afraid nothing else is as fascinating.</p>

<p><strong>Quill: Looking back at the history of genetics, are there lessons to take away in how we think about science and scientific progress?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Shan:</strong> When we look back, we see that genetics developed through multiple parallel lines from the very beginning. We’ve got Darwin. We’ve got de Vries developing Darwin’s approach. We’ve got Francis Galton and his biometric approach, developed further by Karl Pearson and Raphael Weldon — which we didn’t even get to discuss. We’ve got Bateson borrowing ideas from Mendel. And there is also the important line of inquiry, the chromosome theory, independently developed primarily by Sutton and Boveri. &nbsp;</p>



<p>Across the century, we start from classical genetics, then molecular genetics and <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/great-grandma-you">now epigenetics</a> (which studies changes in an organism that result from how genes are turned on and off, rather than alterations to the DNA sequence). That’s three historical episodes. One popular interpretation is that these three historical episodes or paradigms can be viewed as three scientific revolutions. But these paradigms are interactive with each other, not destructive or revolutionary. For instance, molecular genetics arises from the need to better understand the physical basis of heredity in classical genetics. Even today, the methods of classical genetics are still used in some problems.</p>



<p>I think there are lessons here about the nature and the aim of science. Science seems to be often characterized as an enterprise in explaining or understanding the phenomena of the world. It&#8217;s right to say scientists do make efforts to explain and understand. But there is another essential feature of science, namely exploratory or investigative. From the very beginning, none of the geneticists of the past century probably had a very clear idea of what a good explanation, what a good theory, what a good experiment would look like.</p>



<p>Our understanding of inheritance improved with the development of investigative or exploratory research. Ultimately, some of science’s most important features cannot be simply captured by concepts like truth or knowledge or understanding.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/tree-species-earth-biodiversity">Earth may have 9,200 more tree species than previously thought</a></h4>

              
                <p>Trillions of trees are growing on Earth, though how many kinds there are has been underestimated, a new study finds.<br><br>Earth hosts roughly 64,100 known tree species. But there could be <a href="https://www.pnas.org/content/119/6/e2115329119">at least 73,300</a> — about 14 percent more than previously thought — a global collaboration of researchers reports in the Feb. 8 <em>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences</em>.<br><br>More than a third of the 9,200 undiscovered species are probably rare and hiding out in South America’s biodiversity hot spots, such as the Amazon and tropical Andes, biologist Roberto Cazzolla Gatti of the University of Bologna in Italy and colleagues say.</p>



<p><a></a>To estimate the number of Earth’s existing tree species, the team analyzed global forest data from two databases — the Global Forest Biodiversity Initiative and TREECHANGE. The researchers used a statistical analysis to account for the number of rare, infrequent trees that could be overlooked, revealing the new difference between documented species and novel ones.<br><br>If more than 9,000 types of stationary, comparatively massive trees remain undetected, Cazzolla Gatti says, then the number of much smaller and more mobile animal species that are still unknown must be even greater.</p>



<p>The research could help scientists target conservation efforts amid accelerating <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/nature-will-protecting-30-percent-earth-prevent-extinction-crisis">biodiversity loss worldwide</a> (<em>SN: 4/22/20</em>). In vulnerable places such as <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/fire-amazon-rainforest-threatened-species-deforestation-biodiversity">the Amazon</a>, where deforestation and fires are quickly erasing habitat, many plants and animals could be being wiped off the map before they are ever documented (<em>SN: 9/1/21</em>).</p>



<p>Continuing to invest in conservation and preserving biodiversity is vital, Cazzolla Gatti says. Without it, “we have not many chances to keep our planet alive.”&nbsp;</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/being-pregnant-unvaccinated-against-covid-19-risky">Why being pregnant and unvaccinated against COVID-19 is a risky combo</a></h4>

              
                <p>Snow covered the storied field of Fenway Park in Boston when Kate Yohay, in the second trimester of her pregnancy, arrived. The ballpark had become a COVID-19 vaccination site, and Yohay was getting her first shot. “That’s going to be a historical moment for me,” she says. “Like what I remember my parents describing as the day they got their polio vaccines.”</p>



<p>Yohay was about as enthusiastic to get the vaccine in early 2021 as one could be. She felt confident in the shots’ development. She was encouraged by the pregnant health care workers who had gotten vaccinated right away and given birth to healthy babies. She did worry whether she would develop a fever afterward and the risk that could pose to her baby. But “it’s still better than getting COVID,” Yohay says. “So for me, it was a small risk, and it was worth the risk.”</p>



<p>Others who’ve been pregnant during the pandemic haven’t been so sure. Cumulatively, only 42.6 percent of pregnant people ages 18 to 49 have been fully vaccinated against COVID-19 in the United States as of January 15, before or during their pregnancies.</p>



<p>Yet unlike when Yohay rolled up her sleeve almost a year ago, there is now a great deal of data attesting to the safety of COVID-19 vaccination for pregnant individuals and their newborns. “Being vaccinated is one of the best ways that you can keep yourself and your baby safe during this time,” says nurse-scientist Ifeyinwa Asiodu of the University of California, San Francisco.</p>





<p>The risks from developing COVID-19 when pregnant and unvaccinated were demonstrated again in a recent study from Scotland. From December 2020 until the end of October 2021, a period when vaccines were available, there were 4,950 confirmed coronavirus infections among pregnant women. Seventy-seven percent occurred in those unvaccinated, along with <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-021-01666-2">91 percent of the 823 hospital stays and all but two of the 104 intensive care admissions</a>, researchers report January 13 in <em>Nature Medicine</em>.</p>



<p>Babies suffered too. The death rate for babies born within 28 days of their mother’s COVID-19 diagnosis was 22.6 deaths per 1,000 births, much higher than the rate for all newborns during the pandemic, 5.6 per 1,000. All of the babies who died over the course of the study were born to women who weren’t vaccinated when they got COVID-19, the researchers found.</p>



<p>Scientists are still unraveling what’s happening behind the scenes during a SARS-CoV-2 infection in pregnancy, and why the delta variant was especially deadly for those expecting. The highest numbers of U.S. deaths for pregnant individuals, 40 in August and 35 in September, occurred during the delta surge.</p>



<p>There aren’t details yet on how pregnant people fare after becoming ill with the now-dominant omicron variant. But experts don’t advise a wait-and-see approach. And the vaccines continue to offer protection against severe disease and death.</p>



<p>“We’ve all seen terrible outcomes with COVID and pregnancy,” says maternal-fetal medicine specialist Cynthia Gyamfi-Bannerman of the University of California San Diego School of Medicine. “And we know how preventable some of those outcomes are.”</p>



<h4>Tough time for infections</h4>



<p>Pregnancy can be a risky time to get an infection in general. Influenza and malaria, for example, can be more severe in people who are pregnant than in those who aren’t.</p>



<p>That risk is tied to changes in the immune system. “Pregnancy is a very complicated immune state,” says Andrea Edlow, a maternal-fetal medicine specialist at Massachusetts General Hospital and Harvard Medical School in Boston. The immune system needs to defend pregnant individuals and their fetuses against pathogens. But certain immune system players are somewhat suppressed in order to tolerate pregnancy, something that is half self and half non-self.</p>

<p>Plus, the physiological changes during pregnancy can hinder the body’s handling of an infection. “Lots of aspects of your physiology are kind of maxed out,” Edlow says, and “operating at the edge of what your body can do.” For example, the blood clotting system is ramped up to be ready to control bleeding at birth. This already puts pregnant individuals at higher risk for blood clots, which other pathogens, especially SARS-CoV-2, can trigger too.</p>



<p>In the first year of the COVID-19 pandemic, there was evidence that those infected and pregnant fared worse compared with those infected but not expecting. Pregnant women with COVID-19 were three times as likely to require admission to an intensive care unit and need ventilation, two times as likely to use a heart-lung machine and close to <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/69/wr/mm6944e3.htm?s_cid=mm6944e3_w">two times as likely to die</a>, researchers reported in November of 2020 in <em>Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report</em>. The study included 400,000 U.S. women ages 15 to 44 and covered January to October 2020, before vaccination was available.</p>



<p>An international study of pregnant women covering March 2020 to February 2021 revealed that those with COVID-19 were close to two times <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8233533/">as likely to develop preeclampsia</a> — a serious pregnancy complication in which the blood pressure surges and the liver and kidneys don’t work properly — as those who didn’t have the illness. Of the 725 pregnant women diagnosed with COVID-19, 59, or 8 percent, developed preeclampsia, compared with 64, or 4 percent, of the 1,459 pregnant women without COVID-19, researchers reported in the September 2021 <em>American Journal of Obstetrics &amp; Gynecology</em>.</p>



<p>And in a study of pregnant individuals in the United States from March 2020 to September 2021, those with COVID-19 had about two times the <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/70/wr/mm7047e1.htm?s_cid=mm7047e1_w">risk of stillbirth</a> compared with those who didn’t have the illness, researchers reported in November 2021 in <em>Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report</em>. There were 273 stillbirths among 21,653 deliveries to women with COVID-19, or 1.26 percent, and 7,881 stillbirths among 1.2 million deliveries to women without the disease, or 0.64 percent.</p>

<h3>Counting cases</h3>



<p>There have been 169,407 cases of COVID-19 among pregnant individuals in the United States since the pandemic’s start, with a spike in late December of 2021 due to omicron. The counts for January 2022 are not yet complete.</p>

<p>When the delta variant took over in the summer and fall of 2021, the risk of stillbirth grew, the study found. From March 2020 to June 2021, before delta, the risk was 1.5 times higher for pregnant women with COVID-19. From July to September of 2021, when delta reigned, there were 3,559 deliveries among women with COVID-19, of which 96, or 2.7 percent, were stillbirths. Of the 169,330 deliveries among those without the disease, 1,075, or 0.6 percent, were stillbirths. That’s four times the risk.</p>



<p>Some clues have emerged as to why the delta variant raised the stakes. With the original SARS-CoV-2 and the early variants, pregnant individuals rarely had detectable virus in their bloodstream during an infection, Edlow says. It was also uncommon for the placenta to be infected, and even rarer for the virus to spread to the fetus, she says.</p>



<p>But with the delta variant, the amount of virus in the body, or the viral load, is higher during an infection, researchers have found. That, in turn, could increase the risk of the virus spreading to the bloodstream and infecting the placenta, Edlow says.</p>



<p>That occurred in a study of three unvaccinated pregnant women with delta infections and mild cases of COVID-19 in the third trimester. Within two weeks of their diagnoses, two of the women had stillbirths, and the third woman’s baby had to be delivered early by emergency cesarean surgery. The two women who had blood samples taken at delivery had bloodstream infections, and all three women had infected placentas. The organs showed <a href="https://academic.oup.com/jid/advance-article/doi/10.1093/infdis/jiac008/6506261">signs of SARS-CoV-2 placentitis</a>, Edlow and her colleagues report January 13 in the <em>Journal of Infectious Diseases</em>. This inflammatory condition damages the placenta and endangers the fetus.</p>



<h4>A shot good for two</h4>



<p>The first inklings that COVID-19 was especially dangerous for pregnant people came in the first year of the pandemic. Year two brought vaccines and plenty of research that found COVID-19 vaccination was safe during pregnancy.</p>



<p>More than 194,000 pregnant people in the United States have gotten COVID-19 vaccines as of January 31, according to the CDC. There have been no reported safety concerns. A study of close to 2,500 participants in a CDC COVID-19 pregnancy registry found <a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMc2113891">no increased risk of miscarriage after vaccination</a>, researchers reported in October of 2021 in the <em>New England Journal of Medicine</em>.</p>



<p>Nor is there a risk of the baby coming too soon or too small, researchers report January 7 in <em>Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report</em>. The U.S. study of over 40,000 pregnant women <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/71/wr/mm7101e1.htm?s_cid=mm7101e1_w">found no link between COVID-19 vaccination and preterm birth</a> (a birth before 37 weeks) or small-for-gestational age, when a newborn’s birth weight is on the lowest end of the spectrum.</p>



<p>In contrast, “preterm birth, stillbirth, adverse pregnancy outcomes, maternal risk, all have been definitively linked to having COVID,” Edlow says.</p>

<p>As for post-vaccination reactions, a study of over 17,000 people who were pregnant, nursing or planning pregnancy found that most reported pain at the site of the shot, while close to a third felt fatigue. Study participants who were pregnant were <a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2783112">less likely to report a fever</a> than those who were planning pregnancy, the researchers reported in August of 2021 in <em>JAMA Network Open</em>.</p>



<p>Among participants who were nursing, 339 of 6,815 after the first vaccine dose and 434 of 6,056 after the second dose reported a drop in their milk supply that lasted less than 24 hours.</p>



<p>Getting vaccinated against COVID-19 when pregnant also appears to protect the baby, as the post-shot antibodies can cross the placenta. For example, a study from November of 2021 analyzed umbilical cord blood from 36 pregnancies during which the moms had gotten shots. All of <a href="https://www.ajogmfm.org/article/S2589-9333(21)00176-2/fulltext">the newborns had high levels of antibodies</a> against the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein (the protein the vaccines target), researchers reported in the <em>American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology Maternal-Fetal Medicine</em>.</p>



<p>And the antibodies are also found in the breastmilk of those vaccinated while nursing, several studies have found. These <a href="https://journals.lww.com/greenjournal/Fulltext/2022/02000/Neutralizing_Antibodies_and_Cytokines_in_Breast.6.aspx">antibodies can be passed along to the nursing infant</a>, researchers report in the February <em>Obstetrics &amp; Gynecology</em>.</p>



<h4>Confidence and doubts</h4>



<p>Even with the reassuring data on COVID-19 vaccination during pregnancy, it’s been hard to stamp out the uncertainty some feel about the shots. Other vaccines are routinely recommended in pregnancy, such as the influenza shot. But the COVID-19 vaccines were new, and pregnant people — as is standard practice — were <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/blog/growth-curve/finally-plan-how-include-pregnant-women-clinical-trials">excluded from the clinical trials</a> that assessed the shots’ safety and efficacy (<em>SN: 5/30/18</em>).</p>



<p>Initially, there wasn’t strong guidance on getting the shots during pregnancy. That left pregnant people wondering, “Is this safe? Is this something I should do now, or should I wait until after I give birth?” Asiodu says.</p>



<p>Excluding pregnant women from the trials can make it seem like “something must be wrong, this must be dangerous,” Edlow says. There were no safety issues among individuals who became pregnant during the trials, nor were there safety concerns in animal studies. Medical organizations said that COVID-19 vaccines shouldn’t be withheld due to pregnancy, but a forceful recommendation for vaccination didn’t come until July of 2021. &nbsp;</p>



<p>There are also structural barriers to more widespread vaccination, which impact pregnant individuals too, says Asiodu. And these barriers do not impede all equally. Hispanic and Black people are less likely to have access to paid family leave than white people. Having to save days for after birth, or for prenatal appointments, makes it even harder to take time from work to get vaccinated. These issues need structural solutions, Asiodu says.</p>



<p>Increasing vaccination among pregnant people also “takes listening,” Asiodu says, “hearing what their concerns are, and really addressing them.” And meeting people where they are, Edlow says. “When pregnant people aren’t getting the vaccine, it’s not because they want to be sick. They think they’re doing the best thing for their baby.”</p>



<p>Plus, pregnant people can be bombarded by relatives and friends skeptical of vaccination. The scrutiny that those expecting face, and the relentless opinions offered about their and their babies’ health, can shake even the resolute.</p>



<p>Caroline Fiore of Lincoln, Mass., knows what that’s like. She was vaccinated against COVID-19 before she became pregnant in the summer of 2021. When boosters were recommended, Fiore didn’t hesitate to sign up. She got her third dose during the second trimester of her pregnancy, in November.</p>

Fiore</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>“I was taken aback by how monumental that decision felt when I was sitting in the chair” at her appointment, Fiore says. It felt emotional and powerful to do something that directly benefitted her and her baby. But she was surprised to feel some fear too.</p>



<p>She has family members who chose not to be vaccinated, including a relative who shunned the shots while pregnant. Their views “never changed my mind,” Fiore says, but played into an anxiety response of “well, what if I’m wrong.”</p>



<p>Fiore had to let go of “any judgment or discomfort around anybody else’s response” to her vaccination, she says. She has no regrets. “After the vaccine dose, you feel a little superhuman, so I’m still kind of riding that wave.”</p>

<h4>Fine feather</h4>



<p><em>A filament of cold, dense gas named the Gangotri wave may bridge two spiral arms near the Milky Way’s center, <strong>Lisa Grossman </strong>reported in “<a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/astronomy-milky-way-galaxy-feather-gas-spiral-arms-gangotri-wave">Scientists find the Milky Way’s first known ‘feather’ </a>” (</em>SN: 12/18/21 &amp; 1/1/22, p. 4<em>).</em></p>



<p>Reader <strong>Doug Holcomb</strong> asked how this newfound “feather” differs from a galactic spur.</p>



<p>The language describing the different limbs of the Milky Way can get fuzzy, <strong>Grossman</strong> says. In general, our galaxy has four primary spiral arms emanating from its center, and an unknown number of smaller arms. A spur tends to be an offshoot of an arm, but the line between spur and arm is not so strict.</p>





<p>“The main difference between the Gangotri wave and other galactic tendrils is that Gangotri runs perpendicular to the larger arms of the galaxy, and crosses two of them,” <strong>Grossman</strong> says. “That crossing of the two arms is unique, although researchers expect that there are probably more of them throughout the Milky Way that have yet to be discovered.”</p>



<p>Reader <strong>Jasmine Melvin</strong> wondered whether the Gangotri wave has stars.</p>



<p>“Many regions within the wave are sites of active star formation,” says astrophysicist <strong>Veena V.S.</strong> of the Max Planck Institute for Radio Astronomy in Germany. Future studies are needed to characterize the total number of stars within the structure, she says.</p>



<h4>Carbon curiosity</h4>



<p><em>Massive stars with an orbiting partner star shed on average about twice as much carbon as loner stars do, <strong>Ken Croswell</strong> reported in “<a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/star-mass-binary-system-carbon-factories-space">How stars turn into carbon factories</a>” (</em>SN: 12/18/21 &amp; 1/1/22, p. 12<em>).</em></p>



<p>When a massive star with a partner explodes, its carbon is cast into space, <strong>Croswell</strong> reported. On the other hand, a single star’s core would have destroyed much of its carbon before such an explosion. Reader <strong>Bill Camenga</strong> wanted to know what becomes of the carbon in single stars.</p>



<p>“The carbon doesn’t just vanish,” <strong>Croswell</strong> says. During a single star’s life, most of its carbon gets transformed into oxygen. When the star explodes, that oxygen is cast into space, helping make oxygen the third most abundant element in the universe after hydrogen and helium. The exact nuclear reaction, he says, is carbon-12 + helium-4 → oxygen-16 + energy.</p>

<h4>X-ray! X-ray! Read all about it!</h4>



<p><em>In 1971, the first X-ray CT scan of a patient provided an unprecedented image of the human brain. Fifty years later, CT scans are still saving lives and helping researchers better understand the world around us, <strong>Emily Conover</strong> reported in “<a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/ct-scan-50-years-anniversary-first-image-medicine-physics">Celebrating 50 years of CT scans</a>” (</em>SN: 12/18/21 &amp; 1/1/22, p. 44<em>).</em></p>



<p>Several readers wondered whether radiation from CT scans should be a concern for those receiving them.</p>



<p>Scientists have continually improved CT technology over the years, not only making it faster and higher resolution, but also decreasing the amount of radiation that people receive,<strong> Conover </strong>says. Although CT scans typically expose patients to more radiation than standard X-ray imaging, the amount of radiation from one scan is still relatively small. Depending on the type of CT scan, the radiation received may be less than the average background radiation a person gets from various sources in the environment over a year, she says.</p>



<p>There is still debate among scientists about the potential health effects of such low doses of radiation, <strong>Conover</strong> says. When a doctor orders a CT scan, they typically will have determined that the benefit to the patient outweighs the small risk.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/how-machines-help-decipher-genes">How machines help us decipher our genes</a></h4>

              
                <p>Back in the 1990s, I toured MIT’s Whitehead Institute in Cambridge, Mass., one of the key players in the Human Genome Project. The massive project was the life sciences equivalent of putting people on the moon. In a large room, rows and rows of big beige machines, automated gene sequencers, hummed along, churning their way through DNA. If this was a scientific revolution, it was a very quiet one.</p>



<p>That quiet belied the decades of human sweat and technological innovation that made it possible to identify and catalog the genetic instructions for a human. But <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/author/tina-hesman-saey">Tina Hesman Saey</a>, a senior writer and molecular biology reporter for <em>Science News</em>, remembers the effort required all too well.</p>



<p>When Saey started working in laboratories as an undergraduate, scientists identified the bases in DNA sequences through a laborious process. The work required her to be part short-order cook, part chemist, part X-ray technician and part medieval scribe. Tasks involved heating polyacrylamide in a microwave to make sheets of gel more than 300 millimeters across and just a few millimeters thick, adding bits of DNA tagged with radioactive isotopes and using electric current to push DNA molecules through the gel, with smaller molecules moving faster than larger ones. Next, the gels had to be doused with chemicals and exposed to giant cassettes of X-ray film, and the film had to be developed. “I used to have nightmares that something went wrong and I couldn’t get into the darkroom to develop my film,” Saey told me.</p>



<p>The end result was X-ray film laddered with black and gray smudges — DNA bases that a person then had to manually identify and record, one at a time. “You would just go along taking it from the bottom,” Saey says, “following each step up the ladder to determine the sequences.”</p>





<p>On a good day, Saey could identify 50 to 100 bases on one gel. Now, robots and automated high-throughput sequencers make it possible to read millions of bases at a time, with computers ID’ing the bases and packaging the data in a tidy digital file. “The robots took over all the tedious precision work,” Saey says. “People were freed up to do the analytical work.”</p>



<p>In this issue, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/human-genome-project-dna-genetics-revolution-green">Saey talks with Eric Green</a>, director of the National Human Genome Research Institute, about the origins of the Human Genome Project and what remains to be discovered. The answer: plenty.</p>



<p>Among the many surprises that emerged from the project is how much we didn’t know about our DNA, including the importance of what before had been thought to be mere “junk” DNA. It’s a delight to see Green and Saey geek out over their fascination with noncoding RNAs, and their excitement over the many mysteries to be explored. I also learned that they worked in laboratories on the same hallway while Saey was a graduate student at Washington University in St. Louis. It’s a small world.</p>



<p>This conversation about the genomics revolution is part of our Century of Science project, which celebrates the 100th anniversary of <em>Science News</em> by exploring key scientific advances.

<p><strong>Tell us a little about your research.</strong></p>



<p>My primary research focuses on the social and health system drivers of inequities in reproductive, maternal, neonatal, and child health. I have completed projects in Ghana, Kenya, India, and the United States examining sources of disparities in the use and quality of maternal health services and in birth outcomes; designing tools to measure person-centered maternal health care (PCMHC: i.e., responsive and respectful care during pregnancy and childbirth); understanding the drivers of poor PCMHC and designing and evaluating interventions to improve quality and reduce inequities in PCMHC. </p>



<p>I am currently the Principal Investigator of several projects, including an NICHD R00 award, on addressing provider stress and implicit bias to improve PCMHC. During this pandemic, I extended my work on the impact of healthcare workers wellbeing and motivation on PCMHC, to examining the impact of the pandemic on the wellbeing and motivation of healthcare workers.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>What are the important factors that you look for when selecting a journal for your research?</strong></p>



<p>Fit with the journal&rsquo;s mission, speed of peer review and publication, and impact or potential impact of publishing in that journal.</p>



<p><strong>Why did you decide to publish with PLOS Global Public Health?</strong></p>



<p>We thought our topic was a good fit for the journal, given the journal&rsquo;s mission. Although it was a new journal with no history to assess its impact, we were excited by the mission to &ldquo;amplify the voices of underrepresented and historically excluded communities and prioritize equity, diversity, and inclusion at all levels&hellip;to broaden the range and diversity of perspectives at the forefront of public health and advance the health of all humankind.&rdquo;</p>



<p><strong>What was your experience of the GPH publishing process?</strong></p>



<p>It was one of the best experiences I have ever had with a journal. The time from submission to acceptance was great: just about 3 months which is relatively short compared to my experience with most other journals. The peer reviewers provided critical but useful and fair feedback and the editor was great in making a quick decision after we responded to the reviewer comments</p>



<p><strong>What advice would you give to other authors considering publishing with PLOS GPH?</strong></p>



<p>Certainly, go for it.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Would you publish with PLOS again? Why?</strong></p>



<p>Yes, I would. It is a good fit for most of my research projects and reaches my intended audience. I have also had a great experience publishing with them.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2022/02/04/do-emojis-represent-the-whole-gamut-of-human-emotion/">Do emojis represent the whole gamut of human emotion?</a></h4>

              
                <p><em>By</em>&nbsp;<a href="https://twitter.com/mattbwarren">Matthew Warren</a></p>



<p>Emojis have become part of our everyday communication online, allowing us to succinctly communicate how we’re feeling in a way that written language cannot. Psychologists are even beginning to use emojis in research, <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0950329318301939">to allow children or other participants to respond</a> without the need for traditional questionnaires.</p>



<p>But is the library of emojis that is available to us truly representative of the range of emotions that we feel? A <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-021-04357-7">new study</a> in <em>Scientific Reports</em> suggests that, broadly, it is — but that there are some important gaps too.</p>



<span id="more-45273"></span>



<p>Many psychologists have moved away from the idea that we have a handful of discrete emotions. Instead, they see our emotional experiences as falling along continuous scales of both valence — how positive or negative an emotion is — and arousal. So, for instance, “sadness” has a negative valence but is fairly low in arousal; “anger” is also negatively-valenced but high in arousal; and “excitement” is positively-valenced but still high in arousal.</p>



<p>In their new study, Gaku Kutsuzawa and colleagues at the National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology in Kashiwa, Japan, looked at whether emojis can be classified according to valence and arousal in a similar way to our own emotions. The team asked more than 1,000 Japanese participants aged 20 to 39 to rate facial emojis on 9-point scales for both valence (ranging from “displeasure” to “pleasure”) and arousal (ranging from “weak” to “strong”). Emoji libraries currently contain 94 face emojis, though the researchers excluded 20 that would be hard to classify (for instance, emojis related to sickness like <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/1f912.png" alt="🤒" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />). Each participant rated a subset of 30 emojis from the remaining 74.</p>



<p>When the the team plotted these ratings on a chart representing valence and arousal, they found a u-shaped pattern (see below). Some emojis like <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/1f621.png" alt="😡" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> were negative in valence and high in arousal. As an emoji’s valence rating became less negative, arousal ratings dropped too, so that neutrally-valenced emojis like <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/1f636.png" alt="😶" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> tended to be rated low in arousal. Then, as an emoji’s valence rating became more and more positive, arousal ratings tended to increase again, with extremely positive emojis like <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/1f60d.png" alt="😍" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> also being rated high in arousal.</p>

From <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-021-04357-7">Kutsuzawa et al (2022)</a></center></em></figcaption></figure>



<p>Using a statistical method that looks for distinct groups within data, the team found that the emojis could be separated into six clusters that fell at different points along this u-shaped plot. Overall, the emojis within each cluster corresponded pretty well with the human emotions we tend to experience at that level of arousal and valence. </p>



<p>These results are not that surprising: we’ve developed emojis precisely because we want to be able to convey emotion, so it makes sense that they reflect our emotional experiences. Perhaps more interestingly, the team found that the emoji library didn’t quite represent <em>all</em> emotions. In particular, there were no emojis that were neutral in valence but high in arousal — think emotions like being “tense” or “alert”.</p>



<p>The team also identified features within emojis that were related to their ratings. An emoji’s valence seemed to be influenced by eye and mouth shape: an upward-turned mouth was related to more positive valence ratings, for example. High arousal ratings, on the other hand, seemed to be associated with the presence of “accessories”: stars in the place of eyes in <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/1f929.png" alt="🤩" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />, for instance, or icicles and a blue face for <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/1f976.png" alt="🥶" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />. We often use facial movements to convey arousal, but emojis are static — so these accessories might be fulfilling that function instead.</p>



<p>The researchers conclude that emojis display a broad range of human emotional states. This is useful knowledge for emotion researchers, who may want to allow participants to respond with emojis rather than text in order to make questionnaires less taxing, or to survey participants whose language they do not speak. However, it seems there is also room for the development of new emojis to represent states like alertness.</p>



<p>That said, the way that emojis are interpreted could be influenced by factors like language, age and culture, so the meaning assigned to emojis by these relatively young Japanese participants may not be universal. Take <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/1f602.png" alt="😂" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />, for instance: there are <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/7kvezb/laughing-crying-emoji-divisive-gen-z-mums">clearly generational divides</a> in how the emoji is used, so this could potentially influence people’s ratings. Before emoji-based questionnaires become a common part of emotion research, it seems like more work is needed to investigate the potential influence of these kinds of demographic factors.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/elephant-seals-eating-males-huge-death-risk-survival">Male elephant seals aim to get huge or die trying</a></h4>

              
                <p>If you’re a male northern elephant seal, your car-sized bulk is crucial to your genetic legacy, since only a fraction of the very largest males will have access to mates. Now, scientists have found that male elephant seals are so driven to eat and grow that they take on great personal risk and are much more likely than females to die while foraging for food.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The findings, described in the January <em>Royal Society Open Science</em>, reveal <a href="https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rsos.210522">a dramatic divide in how and where male and female elephant seals mostly feed</a> and how their different mating strategies play a role in choosing those locations.</p>



<p>Male and female northern elephant seals (<em>Mirounga angustirostris</em>) look quite different from each other. Females can weigh hundreds of kilograms, but males are truly humongous, growing three to seven times as large as females. Despite these physical differences between the sexes, much of the scientific research has targeted just females, says ecophysiologist Sarah Kienle at Baylor University in Waco, Texas.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Kienle wanted to know how the substantial size differences between the sexes impact their feeding behaviors.&nbsp;</p>





<p>As part of a long-term, ongoing monitoring project of elephant seals at Año Nuevo State Park in California, Kienle and colleagues attached depth loggers and satellite and radio transmitters to more than 200 seals from 2006 to 2015. The researchers measured the seals’ fat stores and used this information, along with the animals’ location and depth data, to determine how and where they were foraging and how well their efforts converted into blubbery heft.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The team found that the two sexes hunt for food in very different places. Females spent most of their foraging time in the open ocean, diving deep for prey, while males stuck to shallower, nearshore habitats, feeding continuously on prey on the continental shelf. This helped males accumulate six times as much mass, on average, as females, gobbling up calories more than four times as fast.</p>



<p>But there’s a cost to that shallow smorgasbord. Males were six times as likely as females to die while foraging, Kienle and her team found. It’s a pattern that was apparent even during data collection.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“I could have told you that from just putting out instruments on males, that it was a 50 percent chance whether or not I was going to get that instrument back,” Kienle says.&nbsp;“And that&#8217;s not the case for females.”</p>



<p>Why the males are dying at such a higher rate isn’t clear, but Kienle suspects predation. Throughout the seals’ range in the North Pacific, orcas and great white sharks patrol nearshore waters.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The waters of the continental shelf support more plankton, fish and other sea animals than deeper waters, which in turn support hungry seals and sea lions. It’s a relationship noticed by mammal-eating apex predators too, says Andrew Trites, a zoologist at the University of British Columbia in Vancouver, who was not involved with the research.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“That&#8217;s where the dinner bell is ringing all day long,” he says.</p>



<p>The risk may be more than worth it to the males. Male and female elephant seals both reach sexual maturity around age 3 to 4, Kienle says. But while females can have pups every year or two for much of their 20-year life span, bulls live half that long on average, and don’t typically reach their peak poundage until later in life. They then monopolize mating access to a group of females only if colossal enough to <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/blog/science-ticker/elephant-seals-recognize-rivals-tempo-their-calls">intimidate</a> or fight off other bulls (<em>SN</em><em>: 7/20/17</em>).</p>



<p>This divergence in reproductive arrangements appears to encourage two different feeding behaviors among the seals. Females are content to avoid the shallow buffet and the jaws of nearshore terrors, aiming instead to eat enough to repeatedly rear offspring over time. Males, meanwhile, search out the faster growth rewards but do so at an increased risk of death.</p>



<p>The males are “the ultimate gamblers,” Trites says. “If you’re a male, then you’re going to roll the dice. And it&#8217;s all or nothing because the payoff is huge.”</p>

<p><a href="https://bookshop.org/a/21798/9781538749715">Origin</a><br><em>Jennifer Raff</em><br><em>Twelve, $30</em></p>



<p>Scientific understanding of the peopling of the Americas is as unsettled as the Western Hemisphere once was. Skeletal remains, cultural artifacts such as stone tools and, increasingly, microscopic pieces of ancient DNA have sparked heated debates about which of several origin stories best explains available evidence. Additional conflict stems from a tragic scientific legacy of ignoring and exploiting Indigenous groups whose ancestries are on the line.</p>



<p>Anthropologist and geneticist Jennifer Raff offers her take on the state of this fascinating and turbulent research field in <em>Origin: A Genetic History of the Americas</em>.</p>





<p>Raff wants to tell the most accurate, if still incomplete, story of how humans settled the Americas by integrating research on ancient and modern DNA with archaeological finds. She refers to people who inhabited the Western Hemisphere before Europeans arrived as First Peoples, a term favored by some of her Indigenous colleagues.</p>



<p>Most researchers think that ancestors of the First Peoples lived in Siberia and East Asia 20,000 years ago or more during the Ice Age, Raff explains. A consensus view holds that those groups eventually crossed a now-submerged expanse of land — the Bering Land Bridge — that connected northeastern Asia and North America. Analyses of ancient human DNA indicate that these migrants gave rise to populations that lived south of an ice sheet that ran across northern North America from around 80,000 to 11,000 years ago. But much remains unexplained.</p>



<p>Raff delves into several competing models of how, when and where people first made inroads into the Americas. One approach holds that Ice Age Siberians, known from archaeological finds, reached North America between 16,000 and 14,000 years ago and, within a few millennia, journeyed south across the continent through a gap in the melting ice sheet. Those settlers probably founded <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/clovis-hunter-stone-points-mammoth-kill-north-america">the Clovis culture, known for its distinctive stone points</a> (<em>SN: 1/15/22, p. 22</em>).</p>



<p>Another view contends that people came to the Americas much earlier, 30,000 years ago or more. A minority of researchers in this camp contends that settlers may have even <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/first-settlers-reached-americas-130000-years-ago-study-claims">reached what’s now southern California by 130,000 years ago</a> (<em>SN: 5/27/17, p. 7</em>).</p>



<p>But archaeological and genetic evidence best fits a third model, Raff writes. In this scenario, First Peoples reached the Americas as early as 18,000 years ago and perhaps over 20,000 years ago. These folks — including groups that were not predecessors of Clovis people — probably traveled by boat or canoe along North America’s west coast, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/people-roamed-tip-south-america-18500-years-ago">arriving in South America no later than about 14,000 years ago</a> (<em>SN: 12/26/15, p. 10</em>).</p>





<p>Raff articulates scientific arguments for these settlement scenarios in clear, nontechnical language. But her narrative revs up when she describes how geneticists, with some admirable exceptions, have treated Indigenous groups as afterthoughts or as passive DNA donors.</p>



<p>One example concerns a roughly 9,000-year-old skeleton found in Washington state in 1996, dubbed Kennewick Man or the Ancient One. That find sparked a legal battle between scientists who wanted to study the man’s remains and local tribes intent on reburying their ancestor. The scientists won. Years later, geneticists who consulted with one tribe in the dispute worked out an agreement to sample the tribe’s DNA for comparison with the Ancient One — <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/kennewick-mans-dna-links-him-present-day-native-americans">and demonstrated an ancestral connection</a> — before his bones were interred by the tribe (<em>SN: 7/25/15, p. 6</em>).</p>



<p>Many Native American groups, especially in North America, nurse bad memories of genetic researchers who misled them about study goals or never met with them to discuss DNA results at odds with tribal oral histories, Raff writes. As a result, Indigenous communities today often refuse to participate in genetic studies. Only a commitment by researchers to collaborate with those groups will resolve this standoff, she argues, as belatedly happened with the Ancient One.</p>



<p>Raff also provides a glimpse of how she came to study ancient DNA. A lifelong love of exploring caves, starting as a child in a caving club, imbued Raff with a respect for extensive preparation and intense focus in the moment. Those traits proved essential for conducting the many exacting lab procedures she outlines for coaxing DNA out of bone samples.</p>



<p>After mentioning that a few large, well-funded labs dominate ancient DNA research, Raff leaves unexplored the implications of that concentration of resources for studying ancient human migrations. But her book gives a balanced view of what’s known about the First Peoples and how scientists can cooperate with their modern-day descendants.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/medical-gofundme-rarely-helps-most-needy">Medical crowdfunding rarely helps those who need it most</a></h4>

              
                <p>Online crowdfunding for medical expenses raises less money than social media posts suggest and deepens health care inequities, a new study reports.</p>



<p>The first large-scale assessment of medical crowdfunding in the United States shows that people in states with higher medical debt and lower rates of insurance coverage <a href="https://doi.org/10.2105/AJPH.2021.306617">are more likely to try to raise money through crowdfunding websites, but less likely to succeed</a>. From 2016 through 2020, more medical campaigns on the crowdfunding site GoFundMe were started in low-income and under-insured communities, researchers report February 3 in the <em>American Journal of Public Health</em>. But campaigns in more affluent communities with higher rates of insurance coverage raised substantially more money. </p>



<p>The study matched state and county census data with outcomes from more than 437,000 GoFundMe campaigns over the five-year period. During that time, more than $2 billion was raised, with the median campaign earning just under $2,000. The study also found that 16 percent of campaigns raised nothing, while less than 12 percent met their goal.</p>



<p>“The returns were notably low compared with the needs people have for medical expenses,” says sociologist Mark Igra of the University of Washington in Seattle. “Even for those with insurance, it can be daunting. For those without insurance, it might be devasting.”</p>





<p>Mississippi, for example, has the highest percentage of population with medical debt and is among the highest in percentage of uninsured, but crowdfunding campaigns there raised the least money of all 50 states. Vermont, on the other hand, raised the most. Its population had one of the lowest percentages of uninsured people and was around the middle of the pack in terms of percentage of population without medical debt.</p>



<p>Only the most successful campaigns are highlighted on social media, giving the impression crowdfunding works, says study coauthor Nora Kenworthy, a public health researcher at the University of Washington in Bothell. But, she says, we need to be more “clear-eyed” about crowdfunding’s limits and the kinds of gaps it fills.</p>



<p>While even the well-off may take a financial hit from a medical catastrophe, “this underscores the need for more comprehensive and equitable security programs for those most in need,” Kenworthy says.</p>



<p>Yet even in countries like Canada and the United Kingdom, which have some form of universal health care coverage, studies of crowdfunding highlight significant gaps. In those countries, crowdfunding is often for expenses indirectly related to illness and accidents, such as lost wages, transportation and child-care costs, Kenworthy says. According to one 2019 study, <a href="https://bmjopen.bmj.com/content/9/6/e026365">crowdfunding in Canada for cancer-related expenses</a> is less successful in areas with lower education and income.</p>



<p>While GoFundMe’s previous chief executive Robert Solomon has called concerns that crowdfunding increases socioeconomic inequalities “<a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2019/11/gofundme-nation/598369/">hogwash</a>,” the new study disproves that, says Jeremy Snyder, a health researcher at Simon Fraser University in Burnaby, Canada, who was not involved with this research.</p>



<p>“Crowdfunding relies heavily on peer networks that typically have similar characteristics, including income, to the campaigner themselves,” says Snyder, who wrote a commentary to accompany the study. “If GoFundMe has data that suggests otherwise, then they have an obligation to make it public.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/satellites-locate-methane-ultra-emitters">Satellites have located the world’s methane ‘ultra-emitters’</a></h4>

              
                <p>A small number of “ultra-emitters” of methane from oil and gas production contribute as much as 12 percent of methane emissions from oil and gas production every year to the atmosphere every year — and now scientists know where many of these leaks are.</p>



<p>Analyses of satellite images from 2019 and 2020 reveal that a majority of the 1,800 <a href="http://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.abj4351">biggest methane sources in the study come from six major oil- and gas-producing countries</a>: Turkmenistan led the pack, followed by Russia, the United States, Iran, Kazakhstan and Algeria.</p>



<p>Plugging those leaks would not only be a boon to the planet, but also could save those countries billions in U.S. dollars, climate scientist Thomas Lauvaux of the University of Paris-Saclay and colleagues report in the Feb. 4 <em>Science</em>.</p>



<p>Ultra-emitters are sources that spurt at least 25 metric tons of methane per hour into the atmosphere. These occasional massive bursts make up only a fraction — but a sizable one — of the methane from oil and gas production shunted into Earth’s atmosphere annually.</p>





<p>Cleaning up such leaks would be a big first step in reducing overall emissions, says Euan Nisbet, a geochemist at Royal Holloway, University of London in Egham, who was not involved in the study. “If you see somebody badly injured in a road accident, you bandage up the bits that are bleeding hardest.”</p>



<p>Methane has about 80 times the atmosphere-warming potential of carbon dioxide, though it tends to have a much shorter lifetime in the atmosphere — 10 to 20 years or so, compared with hundreds of years. The greenhouse gas can seep into the atmosphere from both <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/fossil-fuel-use-may-emit-more-methane-than-thought">natural and human-made sources</a> (<em>SN: 2/19/20</em>).</p>



<p>In oil and gas production, massive methane bursts might be the result of accidents or leaky pipelines or other facilities, Lauvaux says. But these leaks are often the result of routine maintenance practices, the team found. Rather than shut down for days to clear gas from pipelines, for example, managers might open valves on both ends of the line, releasing and burning off the gas quickly. That sort of practice stood out starkly in satellite images as “two giant plumes” along a pipeline track, Lauvaux says.</p>



<p>Stopping such practices and repairing leaky facilities are relatively easy, which is why such changes may be the low-hanging fruit when it comes to addressing greenhouse gas emissions. But identifying the particular sources of those huge methane emissions has been the challenge. Airborne studies can help pinpoint some large sources, such as <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/california-landfills-are-belching-high-levels-climate-warming-methane">landfills, dairy farms and oil and gas producers</a>, but such flights are limited by being both regional and of short duration (<em>SN: 11/14/19</em>).</p>



<p>Satellites, such as the European Space Agency’s TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument, or TROPOMI, offer a much bigger window in both space and time. Scientists have previously used TROPOMI to estimate the overall leakiness of <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/permian-basin-oil-region-leaking-twice-methane-once-thought">oil and gas production in the southwestern United States&#8217; massive Permian Basin</a>, finding that the region sends twice as much methane to the atmosphere as previously thought (<em>SN: 4/22/20</em>).</p>



<div class="wp-block-sciencenews-content-sidebar">
<h2>Hot spots</h2>



<p>Satellite images helped scientists identify oil and gas ultra-emitters of methane (orange circles), with the biggest emitters releasing as much as 500 metric tons of the gas per hour to the atmosphere (larger orange circles). Blue lines show gas pipelines. Some of the emission hot spots followed the traces of those pipelines, such as in Russia.</p>

<p>In the new study, the team didn’t include sources in the Permian Basin among the ultra-emitters; the large emissions from that region are the result of numerous tightly clustered but smaller emissions sources. Because TROPOMI doesn’t peer well through clouds, other regions around the globe, such as Canada and the equatorial tropics, also weren’t included.</p>



<p>But that doesn’t mean those regions are off the hook, Lauvaux says. “There’s just no data available.” On the heels of this broad-brush view from TROPOMI, Lauvaux and other scientists are now working to plug those data gaps using other satellites with better resolution and the ability to penetrate clouds.</p>



<p>Stopping all of these big leaks, which amount to an estimated 8 to 12 percent of total annual methane emissions from oil and gas production, could save these countries billions of dollars, the researchers say. And the reduction in those emissions would be about as beneficial to the planet as cutting all emissions from Australia since 2005, or removing 20 million vehicles from the roads for a year.</p>



<p>Such a global map can also be helpful to countries in meeting their goals under the Global Methane Pledge launched in November <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/climate-change-communication-numbers-goals">at the United Nations’ annual climate summit</a>, says Daniel Jacob, an atmospheric chemist at Harvard University who was not involved in the study (<em>SN: 1/11/22</em>).</p>



<p>Signatories to the pledge agreed to reduce global emissions of the gas by at least 30 percent relative to 2020 levels by 2030. These new findings, Jacob says, can help achieve that target because it “encourages action rather than despair.”&nbsp;</p>

                <p><em>This blog is part of a series exploring our APC-alternative models from Sara Rouhi, Director of Strategic Partnerships at PLOS</em>. <em>Read our previous post </em><a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2022/01/open-access-doesnt-need-apcs-part-1/"><em>here</em></a><em>.</em></p>



<p>When we made the decision to launch new journals at PLOS<a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2021/04/launching-new-journals-2021/"> last year</a>, we knew we had to build these spaces from a new blueprint in order to surface all research of the highest quality and fulfill our aims, namely, to:</p>



<ul><li>Include the broadest range of researchers&rsquo; voices globally</li><li>Ensure that these new Open Science platforms would be shaped at every level by the communities they aimed to serve</li><li>Avoid simply extending existing power structures</li></ul>



<p>That gave us an opportunity to try something new: supporting the cost of Open Access publication in a regionally equitable way.</p>



<p><strong>A New Model for New Journals</strong></p>



<p><em>PLOS Climate, PLOS Global Public Health, </em>and <em>PLOS Water</em> share a mission to represent the broadest range of high-quality research from around the world, foster knowledge-sharing and collaboration, and ensure previously underrepresented perspectives have an equally powerful voice in shaping scientific literature in these critical areas.</p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator">



<p class="has-text-align-right"><em>&nbsp;&ldquo;&hellip;Our aim with the journal is to amplify the work of researchers and practitioners, especially from lower-middle-income-countries, historically underrepresented groups, and individuals working and living within their impacted communities,&rdquo;&nbsp;</em></p>



<p class="has-text-align-right">Madhukar Pai, Co-Editor-in-Chief, <a href="https://journals.plos.org/globalpublichealth/">PLOS Global Public Health</a></p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator">



<p><strong>Inclusion is the foundation of these journals</strong>. From their broad scopes, to the diversity of the editorial boards who will shape content, policies, and practices reflective of the research communities working in these fields. As spaces that will drive rigorous, evidence-based approaches to global challenges, authors of all backgrounds should feel like they have a place to make their research heard in these journals. To support them, we needed inclusion to be built into our foundation&mdash;including an alternative to APCs.</p>



<p>Like our other institutional partnership models, the Global Equity model provides a pathway for institutions to cover the cost of unlimited publications for their authors and eliminate APCs. What makes this model different, is that partnership fees for each institution are adjusted by World Bank lending tier groups to be more reflective of <em>their </em>regional economy.</p>



<p><strong>A Simpler Open Access Solution for All Authors</strong></p>



<p>At all economic levels, institutional partnership through the Global Equity model makes it easier for authors to publish in Open Access journals. Institutions in low and middle-income countries as well as those in high-income regions are able to provide unlimited publishing opportunities for their authors with greater efficiency and financial stability than individual APCs. The model also automatically includes institutions in Research4Life countries as partners, enabling these authors to publish for free.</p>



<p>PLOS has always offered <a href="https://plos.org/publish/fees/#fee-assistance">publication support</a> to ensure researchers who lacked funding for APCs were able to publish in our journals. However, the need for that very support system is evidence that the APC model underlying most Open Access journals has carried on a legacy of barriers in scholarly communication disproportionately affecting researchers in lower-resourced countries, making it harder for those perspectives to achieve the same recognition in scholarly literature.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The Global Equity model systematically acknowledges economic differences and offers an appropriate solution so that authors in these regions do not need to <em>ask </em>for assistance, they are simply included.</p>



<p>We will still have a robust publication fee assistance program for any researcher who cannot afford APCs, but we hope that as our partnerships with institutions expand, this will no longer be the <em>only</em> recourse available to researchers, merely a backup option.</p>



<p><strong>Stronger Together</strong></p>



<p>We believe broader voices and better collaboration, leads to better quality science and immediate expansion of the &ldquo;leading&rdquo; solutions impacting how we address global challenges. These journals will empower urgent action and collaboration&ndash;between researchers, policy-makers, and other leaders&ndash;based on research of the highest ethical and methodological standards, underpinned by transparent, Open Science practices. By removing financial barriers for institutions to support Open Access we hope the Global Equity model makes it easier for institutions in all regions to partner with us in this vision.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-right"><em>&ldquo;It has never been more important to connect scholars and practitioners working to close the gap in access to water and sanitation services with those focused on managing freshwater resources</em><strong><em> </em></strong><em>in a changing climate.&rdquo;&nbsp;</em></p>



<p class="has-text-align-right">Jenna Davis, Co-Editor-in-Chief, <a href="https://journals.plos.org/water/">PLOS Water</a></p>



<p class="has-text-align-right"><em>&ldquo;We hope to be a platform for communicating [robust science] with a strong emphasis on opportunities for early career researchers in</em><strong><em> </em></strong><em>addition to established researchers, as well as those from groups and countries traditionally underrepresented in this field.&rdquo;</em></p>

<hr class="wp-block-separator">



<p>We will always have more work to do in making science, and the process of publishing science fair and equitable for every researcher and we are continually learning how we can evolve our practices to amplify diverse voices in the ways that they want to be heard.</p>
