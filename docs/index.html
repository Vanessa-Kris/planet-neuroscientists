<p><strong>Tell us a little about your research.</strong></p>



<p>My primary research focuses on the social and health system drivers of inequities in reproductive, maternal, neonatal, and child health. I have completed projects in Ghana, Kenya, India, and the United States examining sources of disparities in the use and quality of maternal health services and in birth outcomes; designing tools to measure person-centered maternal health care (PCMHC: i.e., responsive and respectful care during pregnancy and childbirth); understanding the drivers of poor PCMHC and designing and evaluating interventions to improve quality and reduce inequities in PCMHC. </p>



<p>I am currently the Principal Investigator of several projects, including an NICHD R00 award, on addressing provider stress and implicit bias to improve PCMHC. During this pandemic, I extended my work on the impact of healthcare workers wellbeing and motivation on PCMHC, to examining the impact of the pandemic on the wellbeing and motivation of healthcare workers.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>What are the important factors that you look for when selecting a journal for your research?</strong></p>



<p>Fit with the journal&rsquo;s mission, speed of peer review and publication, and impact or potential impact of publishing in that journal.</p>



<p><strong>Why did you decide to publish with PLOS Global Public Health?</strong></p>



<p>We thought our topic was a good fit for the journal, given the journal&rsquo;s mission. Although it was a new journal with no history to assess its impact, we were excited by the mission to &ldquo;amplify the voices of underrepresented and historically excluded communities and prioritize equity, diversity, and inclusion at all levels&hellip;to broaden the range and diversity of perspectives at the forefront of public health and advance the health of all humankind.&rdquo;</p>



<p><strong>What was your experience of the GPH publishing process?</strong></p>



<p>It was one of the best experiences I have ever had with a journal. The time from submission to acceptance was great: just about 3 months which is relatively short compared to my experience with most other journals. The peer reviewers provided critical but useful and fair feedback and the editor was great in making a quick decision after we responded to the reviewer comments</p>



<p><strong>What advice would you give to other authors considering publishing with PLOS GPH?</strong></p>



<p>Certainly, go for it.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Would you publish with PLOS again? Why?</strong></p>



<p>Yes, I would. It is a good fit for most of my research projects and reaches my intended audience. I have also had a great experience publishing with them.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2022/02/04/do-emojis-represent-the-whole-gamut-of-human-emotion/">Do emojis represent the whole gamut of human emotion?</a></h4>

              
                <p><em>By</em>&nbsp;<a href="https://twitter.com/mattbwarren">Matthew Warren</a></p>



<p>Emojis have become part of our everyday communication online, allowing us to succinctly communicate how we’re feeling in a way that written language cannot. Psychologists are even beginning to use emojis in research, <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0950329318301939">to allow children or other participants to respond</a> without the need for traditional questionnaires.</p>



<p>But is the library of emojis that is available to us truly representative of the range of emotions that we feel? A <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-021-04357-7">new study</a> in <em>Scientific Reports</em> suggests that, broadly, it is — but that there are some important gaps too.</p>



<span id="more-45273"></span>



<p>Many psychologists have moved away from the idea that we have a handful of discrete emotions. Instead, they see our emotional experiences as falling along continuous scales of both valence — how positive or negative an emotion is — and arousal. So, for instance, “sadness” has a negative valence but is fairly low in arousal; “anger” is also negatively-valenced but high in arousal; and “excitement” is positively-valenced but still high in arousal.</p>



<p>In their new study, Gaku Kutsuzawa and colleagues at the National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology in Kashiwa, Japan, looked at whether emojis can be classified according to valence and arousal in a similar way to our own emotions. The team asked more than 1,000 Japanese participants aged 20 to 39 to rate facial emojis on 9-point scales for both valence (ranging from “displeasure” to “pleasure”) and arousal (ranging from “weak” to “strong”). Emoji libraries currently contain 94 face emojis, though the researchers excluded 20 that would be hard to classify (for instance, emojis related to sickness like <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/1f912.png" alt="🤒" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />). Each participant rated a subset of 30 emojis from the remaining 74.</p>



<p>When the the team plotted these ratings on a chart representing valence and arousal, they found a u-shaped pattern (see below). Some emojis like <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/1f621.png" alt="😡" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> were negative in valence and high in arousal. As an emoji’s valence rating became less negative, arousal ratings dropped too, so that neutrally-valenced emojis like <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/1f636.png" alt="😶" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> tended to be rated low in arousal. Then, as an emoji’s valence rating became more and more positive, arousal ratings tended to increase again, with extremely positive emojis like <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/1f60d.png" alt="😍" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> also being rated high in arousal.</p>

From <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-021-04357-7">Kutsuzawa et al (2022)</a></center></em></figcaption></figure>



<p>Using a statistical method that looks for distinct groups within data, the team found that the emojis could be separated into six clusters that fell at different points along this u-shaped plot. Overall, the emojis within each cluster corresponded pretty well with the human emotions we tend to experience at that level of arousal and valence. </p>



<p>These results are not that surprising: we’ve developed emojis precisely because we want to be able to convey emotion, so it makes sense that they reflect our emotional experiences. Perhaps more interestingly, the team found that the emoji library didn’t quite represent <em>all</em> emotions. In particular, there were no emojis that were neutral in valence but high in arousal — think emotions like being “tense” or “alert”.</p>



<p>The team also identified features within emojis that were related to their ratings. An emoji’s valence seemed to be influenced by eye and mouth shape: an upward-turned mouth was related to more positive valence ratings, for example. High arousal ratings, on the other hand, seemed to be associated with the presence of “accessories”: stars in the place of eyes in <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/1f929.png" alt="🤩" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />, for instance, or icicles and a blue face for <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/1f976.png" alt="🥶" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />. We often use facial movements to convey arousal, but emojis are static — so these accessories might be fulfilling that function instead.</p>



<p>The researchers conclude that emojis display a broad range of human emotional states. This is useful knowledge for emotion researchers, who may want to allow participants to respond with emojis rather than text in order to make questionnaires less taxing, or to survey participants whose language they do not speak. However, it seems there is also room for the development of new emojis to represent states like alertness.</p>



<p>That said, the way that emojis are interpreted could be influenced by factors like language, age and culture, so the meaning assigned to emojis by these relatively young Japanese participants may not be universal. Take <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/1f602.png" alt="😂" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />, for instance: there are <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/7kvezb/laughing-crying-emoji-divisive-gen-z-mums">clearly generational divides</a> in how the emoji is used, so this could potentially influence people’s ratings. Before emoji-based questionnaires become a common part of emotion research, it seems like more work is needed to investigate the potential influence of these kinds of demographic factors.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/elephant-seals-eating-males-huge-death-risk-survival">Male elephant seals aim to get huge or die trying</a></h4>

              
                <p>If you’re a male northern elephant seal, your car-sized bulk is crucial to your genetic legacy, since only a fraction of the very largest males will have access to mates. Now, scientists have found that male elephant seals are so driven to eat and grow that they take on great personal risk and are much more likely than females to die while foraging for food.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The findings, described in the January <em>Royal Society Open Science</em>, reveal <a href="https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rsos.210522">a dramatic divide in how and where male and female elephant seals mostly feed</a> and how their different mating strategies play a role in choosing those locations.</p>



<p>Male and female northern elephant seals (<em>Mirounga angustirostris</em>) look quite different from each other. Females can weigh hundreds of kilograms, but males are truly humongous, growing three to seven times as large as females. Despite these physical differences between the sexes, much of the scientific research has targeted just females, says ecophysiologist Sarah Kienle at Baylor University in Waco, Texas.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Kienle wanted to know how the substantial size differences between the sexes impact their feeding behaviors.&nbsp;</p>





<p>As part of a long-term, ongoing monitoring project of elephant seals at Año Nuevo State Park in California, Kienle and colleagues attached depth loggers and satellite and radio transmitters to more than 200 seals from 2006 to 2015. The researchers measured the seals’ fat stores and used this information, along with the animals’ location and depth data, to determine how and where they were foraging and how well their efforts converted into blubbery heft.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The team found that the two sexes hunt for food in very different places. Females spent most of their foraging time in the open ocean, diving deep for prey, while males stuck to shallower, nearshore habitats, feeding continuously on prey on the continental shelf. This helped males accumulate six times as much mass, on average, as females, gobbling up calories more than four times as fast.</p>



<p>But there’s a cost to that shallow smorgasbord. Males were six times as likely as females to die while foraging, Kienle and her team found. It’s a pattern that was apparent even during data collection.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“I could have told you that from just putting out instruments on males, that it was a 50 percent chance whether or not I was going to get that instrument back,” Kienle says.&nbsp;“And that&#8217;s not the case for females.”</p>



<p>Why the males are dying at such a higher rate isn’t clear, but Kienle suspects predation. Throughout the seals’ range in the North Pacific, orcas and great white sharks patrol nearshore waters.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The waters of the continental shelf support more plankton, fish and other sea animals than deeper waters, which in turn support hungry seals and sea lions. It’s a relationship noticed by mammal-eating apex predators too, says Andrew Trites, a zoologist at the University of British Columbia in Vancouver, who was not involved with the research.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“That&#8217;s where the dinner bell is ringing all day long,” he says.</p>



<p>The risk may be more than worth it to the males. Male and female elephant seals both reach sexual maturity around age 3 to 4, Kienle says. But while females can have pups every year or two for much of their 20-year life span, bulls live half that long on average, and don’t typically reach their peak poundage until later in life. They then monopolize mating access to a group of females only if colossal enough to <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/blog/science-ticker/elephant-seals-recognize-rivals-tempo-their-calls">intimidate</a> or fight off other bulls (<em>SN</em><em>: 7/20/17</em>).</p>



<p>This divergence in reproductive arrangements appears to encourage two different feeding behaviors among the seals. Females are content to avoid the shallow buffet and the jaws of nearshore terrors, aiming instead to eat enough to repeatedly rear offspring over time. Males, meanwhile, search out the faster growth rewards but do so at an increased risk of death.</p>



<p>The males are “the ultimate gamblers,” Trites says. “If you’re a male, then you’re going to roll the dice. And it&#8217;s all or nothing because the payoff is huge.”</p>

<p><a href="https://bookshop.org/a/21798/9781538749715">Origin</a><br><em>Jennifer Raff</em><br><em>Twelve, $30</em></p>



<p>Scientific understanding of the peopling of the Americas is as unsettled as the Western Hemisphere once was. Skeletal remains, cultural artifacts such as stone tools and, increasingly, microscopic pieces of ancient DNA have sparked heated debates about which of several origin stories best explains available evidence. Additional conflict stems from a tragic scientific legacy of ignoring and exploiting Indigenous groups whose ancestries are on the line.</p>



<p>Anthropologist and geneticist Jennifer Raff offers her take on the state of this fascinating and turbulent research field in <em>Origin: A Genetic History of the Americas</em>.</p>





<p>Raff wants to tell the most accurate, if still incomplete, story of how humans settled the Americas by integrating research on ancient and modern DNA with archaeological finds. She refers to people who inhabited the Western Hemisphere before Europeans arrived as First Peoples, a term favored by some of her Indigenous colleagues.</p>



<p>Most researchers think that ancestors of the First Peoples lived in Siberia and East Asia 20,000 years ago or more during the Ice Age, Raff explains. A consensus view holds that those groups eventually crossed a now-submerged expanse of land — the Bering Land Bridge — that connected northeastern Asia and North America. Analyses of ancient human DNA indicate that these migrants gave rise to populations that lived south of an ice sheet that ran across northern North America from around 80,000 to 11,000 years ago. But much remains unexplained.</p>



<p>Raff delves into several competing models of how, when and where people first made inroads into the Americas. One approach holds that Ice Age Siberians, known from archaeological finds, reached North America between 16,000 and 14,000 years ago and, within a few millennia, journeyed south across the continent through a gap in the melting ice sheet. Those settlers probably founded <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/clovis-hunter-stone-points-mammoth-kill-north-america">the Clovis culture, known for its distinctive stone points</a> (<em>SN: 1/15/22, p. 22</em>).</p>



<p>Another view contends that people came to the Americas much earlier, 30,000 years ago or more. A minority of researchers in this camp contends that settlers may have even <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/first-settlers-reached-americas-130000-years-ago-study-claims">reached what’s now southern California by 130,000 years ago</a> (<em>SN: 5/27/17, p. 7</em>).</p>



<p>But archaeological and genetic evidence best fits a third model, Raff writes. In this scenario, First Peoples reached the Americas as early as 18,000 years ago and perhaps over 20,000 years ago. These folks — including groups that were not predecessors of Clovis people — probably traveled by boat or canoe along North America’s west coast, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/people-roamed-tip-south-america-18500-years-ago">arriving in South America no later than about 14,000 years ago</a> (<em>SN: 12/26/15, p. 10</em>).</p>





<p>Raff articulates scientific arguments for these settlement scenarios in clear, nontechnical language. But her narrative revs up when she describes how geneticists, with some admirable exceptions, have treated Indigenous groups as afterthoughts or as passive DNA donors.</p>



<p>One example concerns a roughly 9,000-year-old skeleton found in Washington state in 1996, dubbed Kennewick Man or the Ancient One. That find sparked a legal battle between scientists who wanted to study the man’s remains and local tribes intent on reburying their ancestor. The scientists won. Years later, geneticists who consulted with one tribe in the dispute worked out an agreement to sample the tribe’s DNA for comparison with the Ancient One — <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/kennewick-mans-dna-links-him-present-day-native-americans">and demonstrated an ancestral connection</a> — before his bones were interred by the tribe (<em>SN: 7/25/15, p. 6</em>).</p>



<p>Many Native American groups, especially in North America, nurse bad memories of genetic researchers who misled them about study goals or never met with them to discuss DNA results at odds with tribal oral histories, Raff writes. As a result, Indigenous communities today often refuse to participate in genetic studies. Only a commitment by researchers to collaborate with those groups will resolve this standoff, she argues, as belatedly happened with the Ancient One.</p>



<p>Raff also provides a glimpse of how she came to study ancient DNA. A lifelong love of exploring caves, starting as a child in a caving club, imbued Raff with a respect for extensive preparation and intense focus in the moment. Those traits proved essential for conducting the many exacting lab procedures she outlines for coaxing DNA out of bone samples.</p>



<p>After mentioning that a few large, well-funded labs dominate ancient DNA research, Raff leaves unexplored the implications of that concentration of resources for studying ancient human migrations. But her book gives a balanced view of what’s known about the First Peoples and how scientists can cooperate with their modern-day descendants.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/medical-gofundme-rarely-helps-most-needy">Medical crowdfunding rarely helps those who need it most</a></h4>

              
                <p>Online crowdfunding for medical expenses raises less money than social media posts suggest and deepens health care inequities, a new study reports.</p>



<p>The first large-scale assessment of medical crowdfunding in the United States shows that people in states with higher medical debt and lower rates of insurance coverage <a href="https://doi.org/10.2105/AJPH.2021.306617">are more likely to try to raise money through crowdfunding websites, but less likely to succeed</a>. From 2016 through 2020, more medical campaigns on the crowdfunding site GoFundMe were started in low-income and under-insured communities, researchers report February 3 in the <em>American Journal of Public Health</em>. But campaigns in more affluent communities with higher rates of insurance coverage raised substantially more money. </p>



<p>The study matched state and county census data with outcomes from more than 437,000 GoFundMe campaigns over the five-year period. During that time, more than $2 billion was raised, with the median campaign earning just under $2,000. The study also found that 16 percent of campaigns raised nothing, while less than 12 percent met their goal.</p>



<p>“The returns were notably low compared with the needs people have for medical expenses,” says sociologist Mark Igra of the University of Washington in Seattle. “Even for those with insurance, it can be daunting. For those without insurance, it might be devasting.”</p>





<p>Mississippi, for example, has the highest percentage of population with medical debt and is among the highest in percentage of uninsured, but crowdfunding campaigns there raised the least money of all 50 states. Vermont, on the other hand, raised the most. Its population had one of the lowest percentages of uninsured people and was around the middle of the pack in terms of percentage of population without medical debt.</p>



<p>Only the most successful campaigns are highlighted on social media, giving the impression crowdfunding works, says study coauthor Nora Kenworthy, a public health researcher at the University of Washington in Bothell. But, she says, we need to be more “clear-eyed” about crowdfunding’s limits and the kinds of gaps it fills.</p>



<p>While even the well-off may take a financial hit from a medical catastrophe, “this underscores the need for more comprehensive and equitable security programs for those most in need,” Kenworthy says.</p>



<p>Yet even in countries like Canada and the United Kingdom, which have some form of universal health care coverage, studies of crowdfunding highlight significant gaps. In those countries, crowdfunding is often for expenses indirectly related to illness and accidents, such as lost wages, transportation and child-care costs, Kenworthy says. According to one 2019 study, <a href="https://bmjopen.bmj.com/content/9/6/e026365">crowdfunding in Canada for cancer-related expenses</a> is less successful in areas with lower education and income.</p>



<p>While GoFundMe’s previous chief executive Robert Solomon has called concerns that crowdfunding increases socioeconomic inequalities “<a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2019/11/gofundme-nation/598369/">hogwash</a>,” the new study disproves that, says Jeremy Snyder, a health researcher at Simon Fraser University in Burnaby, Canada, who was not involved with this research.</p>



<p>“Crowdfunding relies heavily on peer networks that typically have similar characteristics, including income, to the campaigner themselves,” says Snyder, who wrote a commentary to accompany the study. “If GoFundMe has data that suggests otherwise, then they have an obligation to make it public.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/satellites-locate-methane-ultra-emitters">Satellites have located the world’s methane ‘ultra-emitters’</a></h4>

              
                <p>A small number of “ultra-emitters” of methane from oil and gas production contribute as much as 12 percent of emissions of the greenhouse gas to the atmosphere every year — and now scientists know where many of these sources are.</p>



<p>Analyses of satellite images from 2019 and 2020 reveal that a majority of the 1,800 <a href="http://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.abj4351">biggest methane sources come from six major oil- and gas-producing countries</a>: Turkmenistan led the pack, followed by Russia, the United States, Iran, Kazakhstan and Algeria.</p>



<p>Plugging those leaks would not only be a boon to the planet, but also could save those countries billions in U.S. dollars, climate scientist Thomas Lauvaux of the University of Paris-Saclay and colleagues report in the Feb. 4 <em>Science</em>.</p>



<p>Ultra-emitters are sources that spurt at least 25 metric tons of methane per hour into the atmosphere. These occasional massive bursts make up only a fraction — but a sizable one — of the methane shunted into Earth’s atmosphere annually.</p>





<p>Cleaning up such leaks would be a big first step in reducing overall emissions, says Euan Nisbet, a geochemist at Royal Holloway, University of London in Egham, who was not involved in the study. “If you see somebody badly injured in a road accident, you bandage up the bits that are bleeding hardest.”</p>



<p>Methane has about 80 times the atmosphere-warming potential of carbon dioxide, though it tends to have a much shorter lifetime in the atmosphere — 10 to 20 years or so, compared with hundreds of years. The greenhouse gas can seep into the atmosphere from both <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/fossil-fuel-use-may-emit-more-methane-than-thought">natural and human-made sources</a> (<em>SN: 2/19/20</em>).</p>



<p>In oil and gas production, massive methane bursts might be the result of accidents or leaky pipelines or other facilities, Lauvaux says. But these leaks are often the result of routine maintenance practices, the team found. Rather than shut down for days to clear gas from pipelines, for example, managers might open valves on both ends of the line, releasing and burning off the gas quickly. That sort of practice stood out starkly in satellite images as “two giant plumes” along a pipeline track, Lauvaux says.</p>



<p>Stopping such practices and repairing leaky facilities are relatively easy, which is why such changes may be the low-hanging fruit when it comes to addressing greenhouse gas emissions. But identifying the particular sources of those huge methane emissions has been the challenge. Airborne studies can help pinpoint some large sources, such as <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/california-landfills-are-belching-high-levels-climate-warming-methane">landfills, dairy farms and oil and gas producers</a>, but such flights are limited by being both regional and of short duration (<em>SN: 11/14/19</em>).</p>



<p>Satellites, such as the European Space Agency’s Tropospheric Monitoring Instrument, or TROPOMI, offer a much bigger window in both space and time. Scientists have previously used TROPOMI to estimate the overall leakiness of <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/permian-basin-oil-region-leaking-twice-methane-once-thought">oil and gas production in Texas’s massive Permian Basin</a>, finding that the region sends twice as much methane to the atmosphere as previously thought (<em>SN: 4/22/20</em>).</p>



<div class="wp-block-sciencenews-content-sidebar">
<h2>Hot spots</h2>



<p>Satellite images helped scientists identify oil and gas ultra-emitters of methane (orange circles), with the biggest emitters releasing as much as 500 metric tons of the gas per hour to the atmosphere (larger orange circles). Blue lines show gas pipelines. Some of the emission hot spots followed the traces of those pipelines, such as in Russia.</p>

<p>In the new study, the team didn’t include sources in the Permian Basin among the ultra-emitters; the large emissions from that region are the result of numerous tightly clustered but smaller emissions sources. Because TROPOMI doesn’t peer well through clouds, other regions around the globe, such as Canada and the equatorial tropics, also weren’t included.</p>



<p>But that doesn’t mean those regions are off the hook, Lauvaux says. “There’s just no data available.” On the heels of this broad-brush view from TROPOMI, Lauvaux and other scientists are now working to plug those data gaps using other satellites with better resolution and the ability to penetrate clouds.</p>



<p>Stopping all of these big leaks, which amount to an estimated 8 to 12 percent of total annual methane emissions, could save these countries billions of dollars, the researchers say. And the reduction in those emissions would be about as beneficial to the planet as cutting all emissions from Australia since 2005, or removing 20 million vehicles from the roads for a year.</p>



<p>Such a global map can also be helpful to countries in meeting their goals under the Global Methane Pledge launched in November <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/climate-change-communication-numbers-goals">at the United Nations’ annual climate summit</a>, says Daniel Jacob, an atmospheric chemist at Harvard University who was not involved in the study (<em>SN: 1/11/22</em>).</p>



<p>Signatories to the pledge agreed to reduce global emissions of the gas by at least 30 percent relative to 2020 levels by 2030. These new findings, Jacob says, can help achieve that target because it “encourages action rather than despair.”&nbsp;</p>

                <p><em>This blog is part of a series exploring our APC-alternative models from Sara Rouhi, Director of Strategic Partnerships at PLOS</em>. <em>Read our previous post </em><a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2022/01/open-access-doesnt-need-apcs-part-1/"><em>here</em></a><em>.</em></p>



<p>When we made the decision to launch new journals at PLOS<a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2021/04/launching-new-journals-2021/"> last year</a>, we knew we had to build these spaces from a new blueprint in order to surface all research of the highest quality and fulfill our aims, namely, to:</p>



<ul><li>Include the broadest range of researchers&rsquo; voices globally</li><li>Ensure that these new Open Science platforms would be shaped at every level by the communities they aimed to serve</li><li>Avoid simply extending existing power structures</li></ul>



<p>That gave us an opportunity to try something new: supporting the cost of Open Access publication in a regionally equitable way.</p>



<p><strong>A New Model for New Journals</strong></p>



<p><em>PLOS Climate, PLOS Global Public Health, </em>and <em>PLOS Water</em> share a mission to represent the broadest range of high-quality research from around the world, foster knowledge-sharing and collaboration, and ensure previously underrepresented perspectives have an equally powerful voice in shaping scientific literature in these critical areas.</p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator">



<p class="has-text-align-right"><em>&nbsp;&ldquo;&hellip;Our aim with the journal is to amplify the work of researchers and practitioners, especially from lower-middle-income-countries, historically underrepresented groups, and individuals working and living within their impacted communities,&rdquo;&nbsp;</em></p>



<p class="has-text-align-right">Madhukar Pai, Co-Editor-in-Chief, <a href="https://journals.plos.org/globalpublichealth/">PLOS Global Public Health</a></p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator">



<p><strong>Inclusion is the foundation of these journals</strong>. From their broad scopes, to the diversity of the editorial boards who will shape content, policies, and practices reflective of the research communities working in these fields. As spaces that will drive rigorous, evidence-based approaches to global challenges, authors of all backgrounds should feel like they have a place to make their research heard in these journals. To support them, we needed inclusion to be built into our foundation&mdash;including an alternative to APCs.</p>



<p>Like our other institutional partnership models, the Global Equity model provides a pathway for institutions to cover the cost of unlimited publications for their authors and eliminate APCs. What makes this model different, is that partnership fees for each institution are adjusted by World Bank lending tier groups to be more reflective of <em>their </em>regional economy.</p>



<p><strong>A Simpler Open Access Solution for All Authors</strong></p>



<p>At all economic levels, institutional partnership through the Global Equity model makes it easier for authors to publish in Open Access journals. Institutions in low and middle-income countries as well as those in high-income regions are able to provide unlimited publishing opportunities for their authors with greater efficiency and financial stability than individual APCs. The model also automatically includes institutions in Research4Life countries as partners, enabling these authors to publish for free.</p>



<p>PLOS has always offered <a href="https://plos.org/publish/fees/#fee-assistance">publication support</a> to ensure researchers who lacked funding for APCs were able to publish in our journals. However, the need for that very support system is evidence that the APC model underlying most Open Access journals has carried on a legacy of barriers in scholarly communication disproportionately affecting researchers in lower-resourced countries, making it harder for those perspectives to achieve the same recognition in scholarly literature.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The Global Equity model systematically acknowledges economic differences and offers an appropriate solution so that authors in these regions do not need to <em>ask </em>for assistance, they are simply included.</p>



<p>We will still have a robust publication fee assistance program for any researcher who cannot afford APCs, but we hope that as our partnerships with institutions expand, this will no longer be the <em>only</em> recourse available to researchers, merely a backup option.</p>



<p><strong>Stronger Together</strong></p>



<p>We believe broader voices and better collaboration, leads to better quality science and immediate expansion of the &ldquo;leading&rdquo; solutions impacting how we address global challenges. These journals will empower urgent action and collaboration&ndash;between researchers, policy-makers, and other leaders&ndash;based on research of the highest ethical and methodological standards, underpinned by transparent, Open Science practices. By removing financial barriers for institutions to support Open Access we hope the Global Equity model makes it easier for institutions in all regions to partner with us in this vision.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-right"><em>&ldquo;It has never been more important to connect scholars and practitioners working to close the gap in access to water and sanitation services with those focused on managing freshwater resources</em><strong><em> </em></strong><em>in a changing climate.&rdquo;&nbsp;</em></p>



<p class="has-text-align-right">Jenna Davis, Co-Editor-in-Chief, <a href="https://journals.plos.org/water/">PLOS Water</a></p>



<p class="has-text-align-right"><em>&ldquo;We hope to be a platform for communicating [robust science] with a strong emphasis on opportunities for early career researchers in</em><strong><em> </em></strong><em>addition to established researchers, as well as those from groups and countries traditionally underrepresented in this field.&rdquo;</em></p>



<p class="has-text-align-right">Emma Archer, Editor-in-Chief, <a href="https://journals.plos.org/climate/">PLOS Climate</a></p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator">



<p>We will always have more work to do in making science, and the process of publishing science fair and equitable for every researcher and we are continually learning how we can evolve our practices to amplify diverse voices in the ways that they want to be heard.</p>



<p>For any authors who are interested in publishing in these journals, we encourage you to check our list of <a href="https://plos.org/resources/for-institutions/institutional-account-participants/">institutional partners </a>to see if your institution has already partnered with PLOS to cover your publication fees, and to reach out to your librarian directly if you would like to encourage them to join.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/milky-way-center-image-radio-emissions-black-hole">The heart of the Milky Way looks like contemporary art in this new radio image</a></h4>

              
                <p>An image that looks like a trippy Eye of Sauron or splatter of modern art is actually a new detailed look at the Milky Way’s chaotic center, as seen in radio wavelengths.</p>



<p>The image was taken with the MeerKAT radio telescope array in South Africa over the course of three years and 200 hours of observing. It combines 20 separate images <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.10541">into a single mosaic</a>, with the bright, star-dense galactic plane running horizontally. The MeerKAT team describes the image in a paper to be published in the <em>Astrophysical Journal</em>.</p>



<p>MeerKAT captured <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/radio-astronomy-history-cosmos-black-hole-planet-universe">radio waves</a> from several astronomical treasures, including supernovas, stellar nurseries and the <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/milky-way-supermassive-black-hole-reached-record-brightness-2019">energetic region around the supermassive black hole</a> at the galaxy’s center (<em>SN: 8/31/21</em>; <em>SN: 9/17/19</em>). One puffy supernova remnant can be seen in the bottom right of the image, and the supermassive black hole shows up as the bright orange “eye” in the center.</p>

<p>Other intriguing features are the many wispy-looking radio filaments that slice mostly vertically through the image. These filaments, a handful of which were first spotted in the 1980s, are created by accelerated electrons gyrating in a magnetic field and creating a radio glow. But the filaments are hard to explain because there’s no obvious engine to accelerate the particles.</p>



<p>“They were a puzzle. They’re still a puzzle,” says astrophysicist Farhad Yusef-Zadeh of Northwestern University in Evanston, Ill., who discovered the filaments serendipitously as a graduate student.</p>







<p>Previously, scientists knew of so few filaments that they could study the features only one at a time. Now MeerKAT has revealed hundreds of them, Yusef-Zadeh says. Studying the strands all together <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.10552v1">could help reveal their secrets</a>, he and colleagues report in a paper to be published in the <em>Astrophysical Journal Letters</em>. “We’re definitely one step closer to seeing what these guys are about,” he says.</p>



<p>The observatory released the data behind the imagery as well, so other scientists can run their own analyses on it. “There’s going to be a lot of science coming,” Yusef-Zadeh says.</p>

                <img width="140" height="110" src="https://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2022/02/iStock-1267688827-140x110.jpg" class="attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image" alt="" style="display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear:both;" /><p><strong>Protein Function Prediction</strong></p>
<p>We are still far from a complete understanding of the many functions of human proteins, even more so for most other organisms. To help remedy this situation, the <a href="https://www.biofunctionprediction.org/cafa">CAFA</a> initiative was set up to allow different teams of scientists to compete in predicting function for proteins from a wide range of organisms.</p>
<p>Many different methods have been developed over recent years for this purpose. They use all sorts of techniques and underlying data to make predictions, so much so that CAFA must make different sets of rankings according to different criteria.</p>
<p>For example, some methods are better at predicting function very well for a small number of proteins, whilst others can make decent predictions for a large number of them. Similarly, some are best at making additional predictions for proteins for which some previous functional knowledge is available, whilst others excel for proteins with no previous functional annotation.</p>
<p><strong>Our Method: DomFun</strong></p>
<p>We developed a method for the prediction of protein function based on their underlying domain architecture, <a href="https://rubygems.org/gems/DomFun?utm_source=bmc_blogs&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=null&amp;utm_campaign=blog_2020_bmcseriesblog">DomFun</a>. Instead of considering the protein as a whole, our method works by dissecting it into its constituent domains and making function predictions for each of these domains individually. These domain-function predictions are then recombined to make protein level predictions (Figure 1).</p>

NetAnalyzer is then used to produce associations between the domain and function layers in this network. Finally, these domain-function associations are recombined to produce protein-function predictions.</div><div class="attachment-image--source"></div></figcaption></figure>
<p>Proteins were split up into their constituent domains based on information from <a href="https://www.cathdb.info/?utm_source=bmc_blogs&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=null&amp;utm_campaign=blog_2020_bmcseriesblog">CATH-Gene3D</a> – this comprehensive resource is centred around providing domain annotation for proteins, by splitting proteins structures into their domains, and classifying these domains into evolutionary and functionally related families. This allowed us to produce the lists of protein-domain pairs needed to build the tripartite network shown in Figure 1. The domain-function information was obtained from CAFA itself, which takes it from the Gene Ontology.</p>
<p>For the domain level predictions, we used software developed by our group, <a href="https://github.com/ElenaRojano/NetAnalyzer?utm_source=bmc_blogs&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=null&amp;utm_campaign=blog_2020_bmcseriesblog">NetAnalyzer</a>, a Ruby gem that can be used to analyse multipartite networks to calculate associations between layers. This produced lists of domain-function associations. These were recombined to make scores for the individual proteins, based on data fusion methods.</p>
<p>We compared our score to other CAFA methods using the CAFA scoring system. We performed particularly well when making predictions for a subset of proteins for which previous knowledge is available, performing as well as the top performing CAFA methods.</p>
<p>We also developed a novel procedure to test the performance of our method against additional functional-annotation datasets to those employed in CAFA, which we have coined “Pathway Prediction Performance”. This allowed us to test the performance of our method against not only the Gene Ontology, but also the pathway databases, KEGG and Reactome.</p>
<p><strong>The Future</strong></p>
<p>Although our methodology currently uses CATH domain annotation exclusively, it can be extended to include other domain annotation resources, such as <a href="http://pfam.xfam.org/?utm_source=bmc_blogs&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=null&amp;utm_campaign=blog_2020_bmcseriesblog">Pfam</a> and <a href="https://scop.mrc-lmb.cam.ac.uk/?utm_source=bmc_blogs&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=null&amp;utm_campaign=blog_2020_bmcseriesblog">SCOP</a>. It can also be extended to other annotation sources – as long as the tripartite network shown in Figure 1 can be built with it, it can be used. Future work is needed to investigate the performance of the methodology using other such annotation.</p>

                <p><em>By </em><a href="http://emilyoliviareynolds.com/">Emily Reynolds</a></p>



<p>Our politics play a significant role in the way we interact with others. We can be <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/0963721413510932">dismissive or intolerant</a> of those with different politics to us — and research from 2020 even <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2020/08/11/people-prefer-strangers-who-share-their-political-views-to-friends-who-dont/">found</a> that we prefer strangers who share our politics to actual friends who don’t.</p>



<p><a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/01461672211065923">New research</a>, published in <em>Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin</em>, finds that this dislike can go beyond mere intolerance: the team finds that we can even feel physical disgust towards members of political outgroups — with potential repercussions to how we treat our political rivals.</p>



<span id="more-45269"></span>



<p>The first study took place in 2018, just after midterm elections in the United States. Participants, who all had an affiliation with either the Democratic or Republican party, were presented with six blocks of ten questions. Each block presented 10 male faces with a neutral expression, accompanied by a description of their interests, age, and voting behaviour. Crucially, half of the men were said to have voted for the Democrats and the other the Republicans. For instance, one description read. “Ryan enjoys salads and sci-fi movies. He has 4 siblings and is currently 41 years old. Ryan exclusively voted for Republican Party candidates in the recent midterm election”.</p>



<p>Participants responded to questions about each man’s perceived traits: how gross, attractive, healthy, intelligent, moral or trustworthy they judged him to be.</p>



<p>Political affiliation had a significant impact on how gross participants felt men were, with Democrats rating Republicans as more gross and vice versa. Interestingly, this was primarily driven by Democratic participants, with a weaker effect in Republicans. There was a similar bias towards rating members of the political in-group as more attractive, intelligent, moral and trustworthy, though not healthy.</p>



<p>In the second study, participants again saw the same neutral faces and information as in the first. Five men were described as having voted exclusively for the Democratic Party and the other five the Republican Party. This time, participants were asked about disgust in more specific ways: how much they felt “disgusted”, “grossed out” and “nauseated” by each man, and how much they related to a picture of a woman making a gagging facial expression when viewing each face. Finally, they were asked how much the faces made them angry and whether they made their blood pressure rise, jaw clench, and face flush.</p>



<p>Again, participants felt more disgust and anger towards political outgroup members, whether expressed through physical descriptions, represented by an image, or described in words. This effect was much stronger, however, in the case of anger than it was disgust. There was also a stronger effect on participants’ feelings of being “disgusted” than on feelings of being “grossed out” or “nauseated”; this may indicate that we feel some form of metaphorical disgust when presented with our political rivals, rather than it being a case of purely physical reaction.</p>



<p>The final study took place in person. Participants were presented with the same expressions as in the first two studies, though instead of representing political affiliation in words the men were shown in t-shirts expressing support for one or other party. Again, participants responded to seven questions about the men: three around disgust, two around anger, and two around moral disapproval. The team also measured the facial expressions of participants as they viewed the images, rating them on how intensely they expressed emotions including disgust, surprise, sadness, and anger.</p>



<p>As in the first two studies, participants reported feeling more disgusted, grossed out, and nauseated when viewing images of outgroup members than those of the same political affiliation; they were also angrier and saw outgroup members as less moral and less trustworthy. However there was no significant effect of seeing members of the political outgroup on participants’ own expressions of disgust, and there was only a very weak effect on their expressions of anger.</p>



<p>Again, this points to the idea that we may report feeling disgust at members of the political outgroup — and even, sometimes, use the <em>language</em> of physical nausea — but not express it in a fully embodied way. In this sense, disgust may represent a combination of things: a moral and metaphorical understanding of the experience along with more physical elements. Setting may also have played a part here: facial expressions serve a social purpose, and so we may not emote as strongly when alone in a cubicle.</p>



<p>Future research could look at these different elements of disgust, as well as explore how (or whether) this affects the way we treat our political rivals. The team notes, for example, that feelings of anger can lead to confrontation, aggression, and punishment. It would be interesting to know whether disgust — metaphorical, moral, or physical — changes our behaviour, either in interpersonal or political settings.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/orca-pod-blue-whale-kill-eat-gory-video">Gory footage confirms orca pods can kill adult blue whales</a></h4>

              
                <p>Killer whales are skilled assassins, hunting everything from herring to great white sharks. Now, for the first time, scientists witnessed a pod of killer whales bring down the world’s largest animal: an adult blue whale.</p>



<p>“This is the biggest predation event on the planet,” says Robert Pitman, a cetacean ecologist at Oregon State University Marine Mammal Institute in Newport. “We haven&#8217;t seen things like this since dinosaurs were here, and probably not even then.”</p>



<p>It’s been debated for decades whether killer whales, or orcas (<em>Orcinus orca</em>), are capable of preying on full-grown large whales. Past accounts have described attempted attacks on blue whales, but no one had observed orcas complete the job until March 21, 2019.</p>



<p>It was “a really ominous, bad weather day” off the Western Australia coast, says John Totterdell, a biologist at Cetacean Research Centre in Esperance, Australia. Totterdell and his colleagues, who <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/mms.12906">recount their whale tale</a> January 21 in <em>Marine Mammal Science</em>, were still an hour out from their usual orca-observing site when they slowed to remove some debris from the water. In the pouring rain, they almost missed the splashing — and the telltale dorsal fins of killer whales.</p>







<p>“Within seconds, we realized they were attacking something big. Then we realized, oh my, it was a blue whale,” says Totterdell.</p>



<p>The team had stumbled upon a dozen orcas assailing an adult blue whale (<em>Balaenoptera musculus</em>), estimated at between 18 and 22 meters long. Tooth marks crisscrossed its flank, and its dorsal fin was mostly bitten off. The most brutal injury was on its face: The flesh of the whale’s snout was ripped away along the top lip, exposing bone. Three orcas slammed into the whale’s side like a battering ram, as another orca began feeding on its tongue. The blue whale finally died about an hour after the research team arrived.</p>

<p>The coordinated attack was consistent with methods observed during other orca takedowns of large whales. Orcas will target the fins, tail and jaw, possibly to slow the whale. They will also push the whale’s head underwater to prevent it surfacing for air, while others below push it up so it can’t dive. “These are practiced large-whale hunters,” says study coauthor Pitman. “They know how to do this.”</p>



<p>Scientists have documented some whale behaviors — like <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/southern-right-whale-moms-calves-may-whisper-evade-orcas">southern right whales whispering to calves</a> and <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/beaked-whales-killer-whales-diving">beaked whales diving silently in sync</a> —&nbsp;to evade orcas, but blue whales don’t have many defense mechanisms besides their enormous size (<em>SN: 7/11/19; SN: 2/6/20</em>).</p>



<p>The new paper describes two other successful attacks, carried out by many of the same orcas, that killed a blue whale calf in 2019 and a juvenile in 2021. All three events happened along the continental shelf drop-off offshore of Bremer Bay, where migrating blue whales pass by a population of over 150 orcas, possibly the largest aggregation of orcas in the world.</p>

</div><figcaption>Caught on tape for the first time, a dozen orcas relentlessly attack a blue whale as it attempts to flee. The orcas’ tactics — ripping off strips of flesh, ramming the flank, consuming the tongue — are consistent with observed attacks on other large whales.</figcaption></figure>



<p>Despite their brutality, orca hunts are family affairs. Female orcas often lead the charge, with calves watching closely and sometimes participating “like excited little puppies,” says Pitman. The hunters will even share the spoils with their extended family; Totterdell observed about 50 orcas picnicking on the blue whale in the hours after its death.</p>



<p>It’s uncertain if large whales played a significant role in orca diets before whaling removed nearly 3 million whales from the oceans, including as many as 90 percent of blues whales — but it’s definitely possible, says Pete Gill, a whale ecologist at Blue Whale Study in Narrawong, Australia. Orcas and blue whales have been interacting for tens of thousands of years, he says. “I imagine they have had this dynamic for quite a long time.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/deadly-bacteria-infection-medieval-child-haemophilus-influenzae-type-b">A deadly bacteria has been infecting children for more than 1,400 years</a></h4>

              
                <p>The tragic death of a 6-year-old boy in early medieval England has given scientists the earliest direct clue to the history of the pathogen <em>Haemophilus influenzae</em> type b. Dated to about 550, it’s <a href="https://genomebiology.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13059-021-02580-z">the oldest case of this bacterial infection</a>, called Hib, ever diagnosed, researchers report February 2 in <em>Genome Biology</em>.</p>



<p>The next confirmed case occurred more than 1,300 years later in 1892, when <em>H. influenzae</em> was first identified. Despite the similar name and symptoms to influenza, the bacterium doesn’t cause flu. But Hib can cause other serious illnesses such as <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/ominous-drug-resistance-hints-appear">pneumonia and meningitis</a> — especially in young children (<em>SN: 1/9/02</em>). Since the late 1980s, a vaccine against Hib has <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/bacterial-meningitis-keeps-falling">largely sidelined the pathogen</a> (<em>SN: 5/25/11</em>).</p>



<p>DNA in a tooth from the boy, who was buried in a plague cemetery in Cambridgeshire, indicates that Hib was infecting people at the same time as the first historically documented pandemic due to <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/an-ancient-outbreak-of-bubonic-plague-may-have-been-exaggerated">plague, caused by the bacterium <em>Yersinia pestis</em></a> (<em>SN: 12/2/19</em>). The relationship between <em>H. influenzae</em> and humans, the pathogen’s only host, is probably much older than that, says Meriam Guellil, a paleogeneticist at the University of Tartu in Estonia.</p>



<p>Unsurprisingly, the boy’s tooth also contained genetic remains of <em>Y. pestis</em>. He probably contracted the Hib infection first, Guellil and colleagues say. While respiratory infections rarely leave marks, the boy’s kneecaps had fused to the thighbones above them. Such damage can happen when Hib escapes the respiratory system and infects joints, which would have taken weeks. This boy was already quite ill when he caught <em>Y. pestis</em>, but “plague, probably, was what killed him,” Guellil says.</p>

<p>This kind of research opens a window into how pathogens evolve to start pandemics or die out over thousands to millions of years. The work is a “great advance” for archaeology, history and the study of ancient diseases, says Pontus Skoglund, an expert in ancient genomics at the Francis Crick Institute in London who was not involved in the study. “The well-authenticated detection of <em>Haemophilus influenzae</em> in an early medieval child promises that it will be detectable in more cases in history, and potentially prehistory,” he says.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://liorpachter.wordpress.com/2022/02/02/a-decade-of-molecular-cell-atlases/">A decade of molecular cell atlases</a></h4>

              
                <p>A recent opinion piece titled &#8220;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.cell.com/trends/genetics/fulltext/S0168-9525(22)00004-X" target="_blank">A decade of molecular cell atlases</a>&#8221; by Stephen Quake narrates the incredible single-cell genomics technology advances that have taken place over the last decade, and how they have translated to increasingly resolved cell atlases. While the article tells some fascinating stories (apparently when hearing a report about the CZI mouse cell atlas Priscilla Chan remarked &#8220;why don&#8217;t we just do human?&#8221; and thus the idea for a human cell atlas was born), it contains several errors and omissions. I have summarized some of them below, and have sent a copy to Trends in Genetics, where the opinion piece was published, requesting corrections: </p>



<ul><li> Quake writes that &#8220;The year <strong>2017</strong> marked the release of our&nbsp;<em>Tabula Muris</em>&nbsp;data set and preprint&#8221; and cites the <a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/237446v2">2nd version of a preprint on the bioRxiv</a> posted on <strong>March 29, 2018</strong>, that later became an <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-018-0590-4" target="_blank">article in Nature </a>on <strong>October 3, 2018</strong>. While it is true that the preprint was first posted on <strong>December 20, 2017</strong>, at that time the data was not released. The data was only released in the 2nd version of the preprint on <strong>March 29, 2018</strong> (the data was made <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE109774">publicly available on GEO at accession GSE109774 on March 19, 2018</a>). Without the data, namely the reads which were processed, it is not possible to verify or reproduce results from a paper, nor, in the case of single-cell transcriptomics, is it possible to build on work by uniformly processing it together with a new dataset for joint analysis. Notably, Quake&#8217;s false claim that the preprint and data was released in <strong>2017</strong> is a repeat of what he stated in a lecture titled &#8220;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=48wfaeg6MU0&amp;t=1843s" target="_blank">The Cell is a Bag of RNA</a>&#8221; (an apt <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.chemistryworld.com/features/catalysts-of-creation/3004523.article" target="_blank">analogy of David Lilley</a>). In the lecture Quake specifically said that &#8220;in this whole gap [from <strong>December 20, 2017</strong> until the paper was published in <strong>October 2018</strong>] where normally you wouldn&#8217;t have access to the paper or the data, the whole world did because we put it on the [bio]arXiv&#8230; not just the manuscript but <em>all the data</em>.&#8221;</li></ul>

<ul><li>The error in describing the date when the <em>Tabula Muris</em> data was shared is significant in light of Quake&#8217;s narrative that <em>Tabula Muris</em> was &#8220;the first mammalian whole-organism cell atlas&#8221;.  Quake describes another single-cell RNA-seq based mouse cell atlas published by <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://person.zju.edu.cn/en/ggj" target="_blank">Guoji Guo</a>&#8216;s group at Zhejiang University on <strong>February 22, 2018</strong> (Han et al., <a href="https://www.cell.com/cell/pdf/S0092-8674(18)30116-8.pdf">Mapping the Mouse Cell Atlas by Microwell-Seq</a>, <em>Cell</em>), as &#8220;further work&#8221;. Guo&#8217;s data was publicly available on GEO on <strong>February 14, 2018</strong> (<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE108097">GSE 108097</a>) along with the publication, a date that preceded the release of the <em>Tabula Muris</em> data. In fact, in the <em>Tabula Muris </em>preprint update on <strong>March 29, 2018</strong>, the <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.cell.com/cell/pdf/S0092-8674(18)30116-8.pdf" target="_blank">Han et al. 2018 paper</a> data is analyzed in conjunction with the <em>Tabula Muris</em> data, with the authors concluding that &#8220;independent datasets generated from various atlases that are beginning to arise can be combined and collectively analyzed&#8230;&#8221;. Thus, it was the <em>Tabula Muris</em> paper that was &#8220;further work&#8221; following the <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.cell.com/cell/pdf/S0092-8674(18)30116-8.pdf" target="_blank">Han et al. 2018 paper</a>, not the other way around. The timeline that Quake presents is shown on the left (screenshot from his &#8220;The Cell is a Bag of RNA&#8221; talk); the actual (edits by me in red) timeline is on the right:</li></ul>

<ul><li>Quake mischaracterizes another paper from the Guo group, namely Han et al., <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2157-4" target="_blank">Construction of a human cell landscape at single-cell level</a>, Nature, 2020. He refers to this paper as one of several that represent &#8220;a distinct strategy of compiling cell atlases one tissue at a time.&#8221; However the <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2157-4" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Han et al. 2020 paper</a> analyzed samples of both fetal and adult tissue, and covered 60 human tissue types which were assayed in (2-4) replicates. <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2157-4" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Han et al. 2020</a> also examined several types of cell culture, including induced pluripotent stem cells, embryoid body cells, haematopoietic cells derived from co-cultures of human H9 and mouse OP9 cells, and pancreatic beta cells derived from H9 cells. The scope of the <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2157-4" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Han et al. 2020 paper</a> is apparent in Figure 1 of their paper:</li></ul>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img src="https://media.springernature.com/lw685/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1038%2Fs41586-020-2157-4/MediaObjects/41586_2020_2157_Fig1_HTML.png" alt="figure 1" /></figure></div>



<ul><li>Quake similarly misrepresents two other human cell atlas papers, namely He et al. <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s13059-020-02210-0" target="_blank">Single-cell transcriptome profiling of an adult human cell atlas of 15 major organs</a>, Genome Biology, 2020. This paper, whose title makes clear it mapped cell types in 15 organs, is also described by Quake as  &#8220;representing a distinct strategy of compiling cell atlases one tissue at a time&#8221; implying that only one tissue or organ was assayed. The same is the case for Cao et al., <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.aba7721" target="_blank">A human cell atlas of fetal gene expression</a>, Science 2020, which derived cell types using single-cell gene expression and chromatin landscape data from 15 organs. </li><li>When highlighting &#8220;his&#8221;<em>Tabula Sapiens</em> which was first preprinted in 2021 , Quake fails to mention the human cell atlas papers above, and instead mentions only preprints from the <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.07.19.452954" target="_blank">Broad</a> and <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.04.28.441762v2" target="_blank">Sanger</a> which were also published in 2021, and a paper from what he calls a &#8220;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.science.org/doi/full/10.1126/sciadv.abh2169" target="_blank">Swedish consortium</a>&#8221; (the work was conceived and designed by Mathias Uhlén and Cecilia Lindskog). This omission makes it seem that <em>Tabula Sapiens</em> was the first human cell atlas to be published, along with a handful of others preprinted at the same time and one published concurrently, when in fact that was not the case.</li><li>Quake characterizes the <em>Tabula Muris</em> as &#8220;representing the first mammalian whole-organism cell atlas.&#8221; As noted above, it was not &#8220;first&#8221;, but priority claims aside, the description as a &#8220;whole-organism cell atlas&#8221; needs to be qualified. Here is how the project is characterized in the published paper: &#8220;Although these data are by no means a complete representation of all mouse organs and cell types, they provide a first draft attempt to create an organism-wide representation of cellular diversity.&#8221; </li><li>In reviewing the technology developments that led to high-throughput single-cell RNA-seq, Quake omits several important advances. There is a large body of work to refer to and cite, including several key advances in barcoding of beads to identify cells and barcoding for distinguishing molecules. For the latter, see, e.g., <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.pnas.org/content/109/4/1347.short" target="_blank">Shiroguchi et al., 2012</a> (from the lab of Sunney Xie). </li><li>The paper declares 2011-2012 to be &#8220;seminal years&#8221; in conceptualizing the notion of a transcriptomic cell atlas. While it&#8217;s true that those were &#8220;seminal&#8221; years for Quake when he published his own sperm (<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.cell.com/fulltext/S0092-8674(12)00789-1" target="_blank">Wang et al., 2012</a>), the timeline seems arbitrary and possibly self-serving. The <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nmeth.1315" target="_blank">Tang et al. paper in 2009</a> could just as well be taken as the starting point for &#8220;conceptualizing the notion of a transcriptomic cell atlas. Tang et al. write specifically that &#8220;For example, mouse embryonic stem cells, probably the most thoroughly analyzed type of stem cells, contain multiple subpopulations with strong differences in both gene expression and physiological function. Therefore, a more sensitive mRNA-Seq assay, ideally an assay capable of working at single cell resolution, is needed to meaningfully study crucial developmental processes and stem cell biology.&#8221; Similarly, Long et al., in &#8220;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nmeth.1366" target="_blank">A 3D digital atlas of&nbsp;<em>C. elegans</em>&nbsp;and its application to single-cell analyses</a>&#8221; published in 2009, were anticipating the notion of a transcriptomic cell atlas&#8221;, noting that their technology would be particularly useful for &#8220;high-throughput analysis of cellular information such as gene expression at single-cell resolution.&#8221; Alternatively, a reasonable starting point for consideration could be 2014, when cells actually started to be assayed en masse:</li></ul>

<ul><li>The Long et al. paper brings to the fore the field of spatial transcriptomics, which Quake ignores entirely in his review. However, conceptualization of the notion of a transcriptomic cell atlas was happening by scientists in that field; in fact spatial transcriptomics was arguably the domain where most of the ideas pervasive in single-cell genomics today originated (see, the <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.05.11.443152v2" target="_blank">Museum of Spatial Transcriptomics</a> for a detailed history and review).</li><li>Another important omission in the Quake opinion is the discussion of the computational biology technologies crucial for cell atlases. None of the <em>Tabula </em>papers, or for that matter any of the single-cell transcriptomics papers that have been written during the past few years would have been possible without the <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://satijalab.org/seurat/" target="_blank">Seurat</a> and <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://scanpy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/" target="_blank">Scanpy</a> programs from the Satija and Theis labs respectively. More importantly, the atlases themselves are, fundamentally, a product of the computational tools used to analyze the data. For example, in the <em>Tabula Microcebus </em>the annotated cell types were obtained by analyzing the 10X Genomics single-cell RNA-seq data &#8220;through dimensionality reduction&nbsp;by principal component analysis, visualization in 2-dimensional projections with t-Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE) and Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP), and clustering by the Louvain method.&#8221; These methods are tuned with numerous parameters and even evaluating when they are accurate is challenging (<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41576-018-0088-9" target="_blank">Kiselev et al., 2019</a>). In regards to dimensionality reduction, there are numerous problems that have been documented with the t-SNE and UMAP leading to questions about results based on interpreting them (see, e.g., <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.08.25.457696v3" target="_blank">Chari et al., 2021</a>, <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/689851v6" target="_blank">Cooley et al., 2022</a>). The only mention of computational technology in the article is a comment that &#8220;Similarly, the development of new algorithms and computational approaches was also a powerful enabler of the field as it now exists.&#8221; </li><li>The omission of computational technology is chalked up to space constraints, yet there was apparently enough space for the Quake to narrate an origin story of the Human Cell Atlas project in which he centers himself, instead of Aviv Regev and Sarah Teichmann whose contribution was much more than to have &#8220;asked whether various efforts should be merged into an international collaboration&#8221;. They were early champions of a collaborative human cell atlas project and have co-chaired the organizing committee from the outset. Teichmann co-founded the <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.ebi.ac.uk/about/news/announcements/single-cell-centre" target="_blank">Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute Single Cell Genomics Centre</a> in 2013, and by 2015 had been awarded the <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.eurekalert.org/news-releases/556250" target="_blank">EMBO Gold Medal </a>in part for her contributions to, and vision for, single-cell transcriptomics. Regev pioneered many of the single-cell RNA-seq technology developments that enabled single-cell genomics, including <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nature12172" target="_blank">single-cell studies of immune cells in 2013</a> and  <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nbt.3192" target="_blank">spatial single-cell RNA-seq in 2015</a>. By the time of the inaugural Human Cell Atlas meeting in London in 2016, Regev had been widely publicizing a vision for a &#8220;periodic table of cells&#8221; and Teichmann had joined forces with her to develop a joint vision to accomplish the task (see <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://psmag.com/environment/creating-an-atlast-of-human-cells" target="_blank">article in the Pacific Standard, 2018</a>).</li><li>There are a few minor errors in the paper. Quake writes that &#8220;These [microfluidics automation technologies] were eventually commercialized by a company I founded called Fluidigm..&#8221;. In fact, Quake did not found Fluidigm by himself; the company was <em>co-founded</em> with <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20170501005558/en/Chan-Zuckerberg-Biohub-Names-Gajus-Worthington-Chief-Operating-Officer" target="_blank">Gajus Worthington</a>. Miriam Merad&#8217;s name is incorrectly spelled as &#8220;Meriam&#8221; and Christophe Benoist&#8217;s name is incorrectly spelled as &#8220;Benoiste&#8221;. A recurring typo is the misspelling of Sarah Teichmann&#8217;s name. It is incorrectly spelled &#8220;Teichman&#8221; three times throughout the manuscript, including in the Acknowledgment section where she is thanked for specific comments on the manuscript.</li></ul>



<p>A broader point regarding cell atlases is that defining cell types, distinguishing cell types from cell states, and comprehensively organizing cells in any species in a meaningful framework, is a monumental task that we are only beginning to tackle. There are no definitive human or mouse cell atlases yet, and there won&#8217;t be for some time. Among the &#8220;atlases&#8221; published so far there is little consensus. The <em>Tabula Muris</em>,  cell atlas annotates far fewer cell types than <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.cell.com/cell/pdf/S0092-8674(18)30116-8.pdf" target="_blank">Han et al., 2018</a>, perhaps because the latter assayed many more cells. Similarly, the fly cell atlas by <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.07.04.451050v1" target="_blank">Li et al., 2021</a> lists ~250 cell types in comparison to the <em>Tabula Sapiens </em>that finds ~400 in human. Perhaps these similar numbers do not reflect fundamental shared biology or a universal organizing principle for cells, but rather the fact that both projects sequenced similar numbers of cells (~580k vs. 500k respectively). Unsurprisingly, the number of annotated cell types in publications is strongly correlated with the number of cells assayed:</p>

<p>The brain presents an especially daunting challenge. An entire recent <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.nature.com/collections/cicghheddj/" target="_blank">issue of Nature </a>was devoted to only one region: the primary motor cortex. Frankly, opinion pieces elbowing for priority claims are neither appropriate nor interesting. To the extent that the human cell atlas will ever become a meaningful accomplishment it will have been a project without a single winner. Instead, it will have been a collaborative effort of thousands of scientists from across the world who will have deepened our understanding of biology to the benefit of all.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/cancer-genetically-engineered-immune-cells-car-t-therapy-remission">Genetically engineered immune cells have kept two people cancer-free for a decade</a></h4>

              
                <p>In 2010, two blood cancer patients received an experimental immunotherapy, and their cancers went into remission. Ten years later, the <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-021-04390-6">cancer-fighting immune cells used in the therapy were still around</a>, a sign the treatment can be long-lasting, researchers report February 2 in <em>Nature</em>.</p>



<p>California resident Doug Olsen was one of the patients. “From a patient’s viewpoint, when you’re told you’re pretty much out of options, the important thing is always to maintain hope. And certainly, I hoped this was going to work,” Olsen said at a February 1 news briefing.</p>



<p>The treatment, known as <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/how-make-car-t-cell-therapies-cancer-safer-and-more-effective">CAR-T cell therapy</a>, used the patients’ own genetically engineered immune cells to track down and kill cancerous cells (<em>SN: 6/27/18</em>). Based on the results, “we can now conclude that CAR-T cells can actually cure patients with leukemia,” cancer immunologist and study coauthor Carl June of the University of Pennsylvania said at the briefing.</p>



<p>Olsen and the other patient had chronic lymphocytic leukemia. Both responded well to initial treatment. But it was unclear how long the modified cells would stick around, preventing the cancer’s return.</p>



<p>Cancer doctors and researchers “don’t use words like ‘cure’ lightly or easily,” said oncologist and study coauthor David Porter of the University of Pennsylvania at the briefing. But with both patients remaining cancer-free for more than a decade, he said, the therapy has performed “beyond our wildest expectations.”</p>



<p>The biggest disappointment is that the immunotherapy doesn’t work for everyone, Porter added. Some people don’t respond to the treatment. Others can develop <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/exploding-cancer-cells-can-cause-serious-side-effects-car-t-cell-therapies">dangerous side effects</a> (<em>SN: 1/17/20</em>). But researchers are “starting to learn the mechanism of why and how it works, so that we can start to get at how to make it work for more people,” he said.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/vinegar-eels-swim-wiggle-synchronize-nematodes">Vinegar eels can synchronize swim</a></h4>

              
                <p>Trapped within a bead of water, thousands of tiny worms wiggle in hypnotic synchrony as they stream around the globule’s rim. And at the center of this undulating gyre some of the creatures congregate into a writhing mass, like the pupil of a demonic eye.</p>



<p>These squiggling creatures are <em>Turbatrix aceti</em>, a species of nematode commonly known as vinegar eels. Individual vinegar eels are often found swimming freely in jars of raw vinegar or in fish tanks. But when troupes of them assemble, vinegar eels showcase a unique juggling act of behaviors; they can <a href="https://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlelanding/2022/SM/D1SM01572A">wiggle in synch as they move together in swarms</a>, researchers report January 10 in <em>Soft Matter</em>.</p>



<p>This captivating ability is exceedingly rare in nature. <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/birds-turns-match-math-quantum-matter">Birds</a> and <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/50-million-year-old-fossil-captures-swimming-school-fish">fish</a> can move collectively, while <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/swimming-bacteria-remove-resistance-flow">some bacteria can coordinate the waving of whiplike appendages </a>&nbsp;(<em>SN: 7/31/14; SN:</em> <em>5/28/19; SN: 7/13/15</em>). Vinegar eels, however, are capable of more. “This is a combination of two different kinds of synchronization,” says Anton Peshkov, a physicist at the University of Rochester in New York. “Motion and oscillation.”</p>







<p>Peshkov and his colleagues first heard rumors of vinegar eels’ weird motions while studying the group movements of brine shrimp, another common aquarium dweller. Intrigued, they packed thousands of <em>T. aceti</em> into droplets to observe under a microscope.</p>



<p>The nematodes first roamed randomly, but over the course of an hour, some began clustering in the middle. Others swarmed to the edges, where they circled the rim. After a while, individual nematodes started oscillating in synch, and the swarm itself began undulating, like fans doing the wave at a sports game.</p>

</div><figcaption><em>Turbatrix aceti</em>, also known as vinegar eels, are millimeters-long nematodes that are able to school like fish and synchronize their swimming. This juggling act of behaviors is rare in nature.</figcaption></figure>



<p>These collective undulations stirred up flows that prevented the water drop’s edge from contracting as it evaporated. But as evaporation progressed, the edge instead gradually tilted inwards, weakening the swarm’s outward push, until the walls finally began to close in. At this tipping point, the researchers measured the drop’s dimensions, which let them estimate that each vinegar eel generated 1 micronewton of force. They could move objects hundreds of times their own weight, Peshkov says.</p>



<p>It remains unclear why vinegar eels exhibit this bizarre behavior. “Nematodes are too small to observe in their natural environment,” says Serena Ding, a biologist at the Max Planck Institute of Animal Behavior in Konstanz, Germany, who was not involved in the study. Figuring out the natural cause for this behavior is difficult using lab observations, since captive creatures act differently, she says.</p>



<p>Peshkov speculates vinegar eels might swarm tightly to minimize their bodies’ exposure to corrosive free radicals in water, or maybe they generate flows to move nutrients.</p>



<p>Regardless, Ding says, “this is cool.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2022/02/02/we-put-more-effort-into-avoiding-losses-than-making-gains/">We put more effort into avoiding losses than making gains</a></h4>

              
                <p><em>By</em> <a href="https://emmayoung.net/">Emma Young</a></p>



<p>The discovery that we care more about losses than equivalent gains has been hugely influential in behavioural economics. The idea was introduced back in 1979, in <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/1914185?origin=crossref">a paper by Dan Kahneman and Amos Tversky</a>. Since then, it’s been demonstrated in a huge range of settings, and led to some effective interventions for everything from sales teams to students. Take <a href="https://libres.uncg.edu/ir/asu/f/McEvoy_Dave_2016_Loss%20Aversion.pdf">this finding from 2016</a>: when students are given maximum grade points at the start of the semester and then lose points according to their performance in exams and assignments, they do better in the end than students who start with zero points and must work to accrue grade points instead.</p>



<p>It’s often assumed that these interventions work because people choose to exert more effort to avoid losses than to make equivalent gains. But there has been only limited work to explore this, write Ana Farinha and Tiago Maia at the University of Lisbon, in their <a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2021-27045-001">new paper</a> in the <em>Journal of Experimental Psychology: General.</em> So the pair set out to investigate. They used an experimental set-up that focused not on task performance — as is generally the case in this field of research — but rather on how much effort participants opted to make to avoid losses or make gains.</p>



<span id="more-45245"></span>



<p>In the first study, 32 young adults had to &#8220;inflate&#8221; one of two balloons that were presented to them on a screen, either to gain points, or to prevent the loss of points. One of the balloons was always relatively easy to inflate — taking 25 presses on the spacebar using the index finger of the non-dominant hand. To inflate the other, a participant had to press the spacebar 75 times with the pinky finger of their non-dominant hand. This was the &#8220;high effort&#8221; balloon.</p>



<p>There were also two trial types. In the &#8220;gain&#8221; type, screen indicators showed that inflating the high effort balloon would give the participant a number of points (the number varied across trials), while the low effort option was literally pointless. In the &#8220;loss&#8221; type, inflating the low effort balloon led to a loss of points, while inflating the high effort balloon prevented loss, preserving the participant’s points balance. In both cases, then, going for the high effort option was always better for achieving the goal of having as many points as possible at the end.</p>



<p>The results were clear: the participants chose to exert more effort to prevent losses than to gain points. In the loss-avoidance trials, they went for the high effort option 79% of the time, whereas the figure for gain trials was only 59%.</p>



<p>The team also ran a similar experiment with 29 children aged 7 to 17. And they found a very similar pattern of results. The children went for their high effort option in 84% of loss-avoidance trials but only 64% for gain trials.<br><br>These percentages were group averages. But Farinha and Maia report that a difference was clear for most individuals, even the children. This, plus the large and very similar effect sizes that they found in their analysis of the adult and child data, suggests that this effect might reflect a fundamental feature of human behaviour, they write. However, they do also concede that this would need checking “across laboratories, contexts and cultures.”</p>



<p>For now, the pair argues that the main importance of the new work is this: “Our findings demonstrate, arguably more definitively than other work, that people <em>explicitly choose </em>to exert more effort to avoid losses than to obtain gains.” (Their italics.)</p>



<p>The fact that children showed very similar results to the adults was significant, the team adds. Though all kinds of successful interventions for adults are based on our stronger aversion to loss than drive for gain, this isn’t something that has been applied in schools — at least, certainly not widely. There might be some arguments for doing so: if kids are motivated to expend more effort, they should do better. However, there are also reasons to be extremely cautious. Young children, especially, could easily view deductions as punishments — and that could lead to anxiety.</p>



<p>There is clearly a long way to go in this field. But, hopefully, new work will lead to more, and better, ways to help us all to achieve our goals.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/covid-brain-fog-coronavirus-immune-response-fatigue">A faulty immune response may be behind lingering brain trouble after COVID-19</a></h4>

              
                <p>A tussle with COVID-19 can leave people’s brains fuzzy. SARS-CoV-2, the virus behind COVID-19, doesn’t usually make it into the brain directly. But the immune system’s response to even mild cases can affect the brain, new preliminary studies suggest. These reverberating effects may lead to fatigue, trouble thinking, difficulty remembering and even pain, months after the infection is gone.</p>



<p>It’s not a new idea. Immune systems gone awry have been implicated in cognitive problems that come with other viral infections such as HIV and influenza, with disorders such as myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome, or ME/CFS, and even from the damaging effects of chemotherapy.</p>



<p>What’s different with COVID-19 is the scope of the problem. Millions of people have been infected, says neurologist Avindra Nath of the National Institutes of Health in Bethesda, Md. “We are now faced with a public health crisis,” he says.</p>

<p>To figure out ways to treat people for the <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/covid-brain-coronavirus-symptom-stroke-anxiety-depression">fuzzy thinking, headaches and fatigue</a> that hang around after a bout with COVID-19, scientists are racing to figure out what’s causing these symptoms (<em>SN: 4/27/21</em>). Cognitive neurologist Joanna Hellmuth at the University of California, San Francisco had a head start. As someone who had studied the effects of HIV on the brain, she quickly noted similarities in the neurological symptoms of HIV and COVID-19. The infections paint “the same exact clinical picture,” she says.</p>



<p>HIV-related cognitive symptoms have been linked to immune activation in the body, including the brain. “Maybe the same thing is happening in COVID,” Hellmuth says.</p>



<p>She and her colleagues looked for differences in the fluid that surrounds the brain and spinal cord in 13 people who had lingering cognitive symptoms from COVID-19 and four people who had no cognitive symptoms. The four people without cognitive symptoms had normal cerebrospinal fluid. But 10 of the 13 people who did have lasting symptoms had abnormalities in their fluid, some of which point to immune system reactions.</p>





<p>So far, the analyses can’t pinpoint the precise changes that may be important. Possible suspects are antibodies that can mistakenly attack key proteins in the brain, the researchers say.</p>



<p>The results, published January 19 in <em>Annals of Clinical and Translational Neurology</em>, <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/epdf/10.1002/acn3.51498">raise many more questions</a>, but show that there’s a real difference in the cerebrospinal fluid, Hellmuth says. “This is a very small study, but the data suggest that there’s a real biological basis in these COVID-related cognitive changes,” she says. “These are not just people who are stressed out … we’re seeing abnormalities that are not typically seen in brain fluid.”</p>

<p>More hints to the brain troubles come from an <a href="https://doi.org/10.1101/2022.01.07.475453">analysis</a> of mice and people, posted January 10 at bioRxiv.org, that has not yet been reviewed by other scientists. By analyzing human tissue and mice infected with SARS-CoV-2, researchers showed that immune cells called microglia are overactive in the brain. When microglia shift into high gear, they can damage surrounding brain tissue.</p>



<p>It turns out that microglia overactivity is similar to that caused by toxic chemotherapy treatments, says study coauthor Michelle Monje, a neurologist and researcher at Stanford University. “When the reports started coming out about the frequency of persistent cognitive symptoms associated with long COVID, I noted striking similarities between ’chemo-fog’ and ‘COVID-fog,’ and decided we needed to study this.”</p>



<p>Microglia were more active in the brains of mice infected with SARS-CoV-2 than in uninfected mice. A similar pattern emerged when the researchers studied postmortem brain tissue from nine people who died with COVID-19. It’s not clear how well these samples represent the majority of people who experienced mild COVID and are living with the aftereffects.</p>

<p>Infected mice also had higher levels of immune proteins in their cerebrospinal fluid. One in particular, called CCL11, has been tied to cognitive trouble in people that comes with age and in certain psychiatric conditions. People with lingering neurological symptoms of COVID also had more CCL11 in their plasma than people who didn’t have those symptoms, the researchers found.</p>



<p>The new results come with caveats, says neurologist Svetlana Blitshteyn of the University at Buffalo Jacobs School of Medicine and Biomedical Sciences in New York, who also directs the Dysautonomia Clinic. “They’re small studies, and obviously they are not definitive,” she says, “but the preliminary evidence speaks for itself.” It’s becoming clearer now that the brain fog that comes after an infection may be “rooted in neuroinflammation.”</p>



<p>Figuring out the cause of the neurological problems may reveal a treatment. Laboratory studies have pointed to potential therapies that can interrupt this immune system overreaction, particularly in brain inflammation caused by chemo, Monje says. She and colleagues are studying whether those same treatments might help with COVID-19.</p>



<p>Tragic as the pandemic is, it may ultimately lead to something good, adds Nath, who is setting up a small clinical trial to study possible long COVID treatments. All these other syndromes such as ME/CFS that researchers have struggled to understand “might benefit from what we learn here from long COVID. We might be able to develop treatments for them all.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2022/02/plos-climate-publishes-first-papers/">PLOS Climate publishes first papers</a></h4>

              
                <p><strong>Note:</strong> PLOS issued the following press release on February 1, 2022</p>



<p>The Public Library of Science (PLOS) today announced that <em>PLOS Climate </em>published its initial cohort of papers. The journal&rsquo;s mission is to disseminate rigorous science that empowers researchers, policymakers, governments, international organizations, and industry to understand dynamic, changing climates and take positive, evidence-based action in the face of climate change. The journal has so far received more than 85 submissions from researchers around the world.</p>



<p>&ldquo;This is such an opportune moment to be launching PLOS Climate &ndash; at a time where, more than ever, robust science must provide the basis for decision-making in one of the most critical challenges facing the planet,&rdquo; said Emma Archer, Editor-in-Chief, <em>PLOS Climate</em>. &ldquo;We hope to be a platform for communicating that science, with a strong emphasis on opportunities for early career researchers in addition to established researchers, as well as those from groups and countries traditionally underrepresented in this field.&rdquo;</p>



<p>&ldquo;We seek to amplify the voices of climate experts around the globe to highlight knowledge from diverse regions and foster collaboration that accelerates progress at a global scale,&rdquo; said Jamie Males, Executive Editor, <em>PLOS Climate</em>. &ldquo;The broad scope of our journal will provide multi-disciplinary perspectives that help decision-makers develop holistic strategies to address the causes and effects of climate change on every level.&rdquo;</p>



<p>PLOS announced the launch of<a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2021/04/launching-new-journals-2021/"> </a><a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2021/04/launching-new-journals-2021/">five new journals last year</a> and <em>PLOS</em><em> Climate</em> is the third of these journals with papers ready for publication. All PLOS journals are underpinned by institutional business models that move beyond the article processing charge (APC) to ensure more equitable and regionally appropriate ways to support Open Access publishing. <em>PLOS Climate</em> utilizes our <a href="https://plos.org/resources/global-equity-model/">Global Equity Model</a>. PLOS&rsquo; existing fee-assistance program also supports authors who are unable to pay any portion of their publication fees.</p>



<p>The Editorial Board represents the full diversity of the research and researchers in the field. It is comprised of more than 120 editors representing more than 35 countries, including 22 Section Editors from 16 countries, and reflects PLOS&rsquo; commitments towards building diverse, equitable and inclusive editorial boards.</p>



<p>Here are links to four papers that <em>PLOS Climate</em> just published, as well as three opinion pieces:</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/ocean-extreme-heat-wave-past-climate-new-normal">The past’s extreme ocean heat waves are now the new normal</a></h4>

              
                <p>Yesterday’s scorching ocean extremes are today’s new normal. A new analysis of surface ocean temperatures over the past 150 years reveals that in 2019, <a href="https://journals.plos.org/climate/article?id=10.1371/journal.pclm.0000007">57 percent of the ocean’s surface</a> experienced temperatures rarely seen a century ago, researchers report February 1 in <em>PLOS Climate</em>.</p>



<p>To provide context for the frequency and duration of modern extreme heat events, marine ecologists Kisei Tanaka, now at the National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration in Honolulu, and Kyle Van Houtan, now at the Loggerhead Marinelife Center in Juno Beach, Fla., analyzed monthly sea-surface temperatures from 1870 through 2019, mapping where and when extreme heat events occurred decade to decade.</p>



<p>Looking at monthly extremes rather than annual averages revealed new benchmarks in how the ocean is changing. More and more patches of water hit extreme temperatures over time, the team found. Then, in 2014, the entire ocean hit the “point of no return,” Van Houtan says. Beginning that year, at least half of the ocean’s surface waters saw temperatures hotter than the most extreme events from 1870 to 1919.</p>

<p>A new analysis of monthly sea surface temperatures across the global ocean reveals how more and more patches of ocean saw heat extremes every year. These four decadal snapshots show temperature shifts since 1980. Beginning in 2014, more than half of the ocean began to reach extremes hotter than even the most extreme events from 1870 to 1919. </p>

<p>Marine heat waves are defined as at least five days of unusually high temperatures for a patch of ocean. Heat waves wreak havoc on ocean ecosystems, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/massive-marine-heat-wave-blob-unprecedented-seabird-die-off">leading to seabird starvation</a>, coral bleaching, dying kelp forests, and migration of <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/animals-swim-thousands-kilometers-escape-ocean-heat-waves">fish, whales and turtles in search of cooler waters</a> (<em>SN: 1/15/20; SN: 8/10/20</em>).</p>



<p>In May 2020, NOAA announced that it was <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/climate-weather-normals-30-years-hottest-record-united-states">updating its “climate normals</a>” — what the agency uses to put daily weather events in historical context — from the average 1981–2010 values to the higher 1991–2020 averages (<em>SN: 5/26/21</em>).&nbsp;</p>



<p>This study emphasizes that ocean heat extremes are also now the norm, Van Houtan says. “Much of the public discussion now on climate change is about future events, and whether or not they might happen,” he says. “Extreme heat became common in our ocean in 2014. It’s a documented historical fact, not a future possibility.”</p>

                <p><strong>Note: </strong>The Irish Libray Consortium issued this press release on February 1, 2022</p>



<p>PLOS, the non-profit open access publisher, and IReL, the Irish library consortium, today announced a new three year open access agreement, which allows researchers at eight participating institutions to publish open access articles in PLOS journals.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This agreement is IReL&rsquo;s twentieth open access agreement and its first with a fully open access publisher.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The agreement, which runs from 1 February 2022 to 31 December 2024, will be available to eligible Irish authors of articles accepted for publication in the journals: PLOS Digital Health,&nbsp;</p>



<p>PLOS ONE, PLOS Computational Biology, PLOS Pathogens, PLOS Neglected Tropical Diseases and PLOS Genetics.&nbsp;</p>



<p>&ldquo;The Irish Library Consortium shares our commitment to building business models that will move researchers and journals toward a more equitable and barrier free form of publishing,&rdquo; said Sara Rouhi, Director of Strategic Partnerships for PLOS. &ldquo;We are excited to partner with them and together we hope to bring permanent change to scholarly publishing.&rdquo;</p>



<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s very exciting to have signed our first agreement with a fully open access publisher. Researchers in Irish universities have favoured publishing in PLOS journals for many years, so we&rsquo;re very happy to help them continue this without author-facing charges&rdquo; said Susan Reilly, IReL Director.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/earth-second-trojan-asteroid-orbit">Earth has a second known ‘Trojan asteroid’ that shares its orbit</a></h4>

              
                <p>A recently found space rock is schlepping along with Earth around the sun. This “Trojan asteroid” is only the second one discovered that belongs to our planet. And it’s probably a visitor.</p>



<p>Trojan asteroids, which are also found accompanying Mars, Jupiter and Neptune, hang out in two <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/nasa-lucy-first-mission-trojan-asteroids-launch-space">locations near a planet</a> where the gravitational pulls of that planet and the sun balance each other (<em>SN: 10/15/21</em>). Because of this balancing act, these locations are stable spots in space. In 2010, astronomers <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/atom-cosmos-22">discovered the first known Earth Trojan</a> — called 2010 TK7 — orbiting within one of these two regions, known as L4, tens of millions of kilometers from Earth and leading our planet around the sun (<em>SN: 8/2/11</em>).</p>



<p>Now, <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-022-27988-4">researchers have found another one</a>. Dubbed 2020 XL5, this roughly 1-kilometer-wide asteroid is also at L4, astronomer Toni Santana-Ros of the University of Barcelona and colleagues report February 1 in <em>Nature Communications</em>.</p>



<p>The space rock was first spotted in December 2020, and follow-up observations suggested that it might be at L4. To confirm this, Santana-Ros and colleagues observed the asteroid using ground-based telescopes in 2021. Measurements of its brightness let the researchers estimate the asteroid’s size — about three to four times as wide as 2010 TK7. They also scoured archival data and found the object in images dating to 2012.</p>



<p>“There is no doubt this is an Earth Trojan,” Santana-Ros says. That decade-worth of observations let the team calculate the rock’s orbit thousands of years into the future, confirming the asteroid’s nature. It will hang around at L4 for at least 4,000 years, the team predicts. 2010 TK7, for comparison, will stick around for some 10,000 years.</p>



<p>Now that scientists know of two just-visiting Earth Trojans, they can envision more. The fact that the team discovered a second object means that 2010 TK7 isn’t a rarity or loner, Santana-Ros says. “It might be part of a family or population.”</p>

<p>A <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/19485506211063259">new study</a> in <em>Social Psychological and Personality Science</em> looks at another facet of favours — the most effective way of asking for them. The team finds that we don’t <em>expect</em> there to be much difference between asking for favours in text-based, video and face-to-face settings— but that in reality, asking for help face-to-face is far more likely to yield results.</p>



<span id="more-45235"></span>



<p>In the first study, participants were randomly assigned to one of five communication channels — face-to-face, video call, audio call, video message or audio message — and told they would be asking five friends for a favour through this channel. The favour, proofreading a half page piece of writing, was asked for using a specific script in order to maintain consistency across conditions. After reading the instructions, participants were asked to imagine asking for help from their friends, and in particular predict how many of them would agree to help. Finally, having left the lab, they actually asked their friends for the favour.</p>



<p>Face-to-face was significantly more effective than any other channel at successfully eliciting favours. But despite this, participants failed to recognise that face-to-face would be better than video messaging or video calling. And although they did realise that asking in-person would be more effective than via audio, they still underestimated the size of this difference.</p>



<p>The second study was similar to the first, but compared email requests to audio and video calls. Audio and video calls were significantly more effective at eliciting favours than email requests — but again, participants underestimated how much more effective requests via audio or video would be.</p>



<p>What the results don’t indicate is <em>why</em> “richer” channels like talking face-to-face — or via video call when that’s not an option — are so much more successful at eliciting favours. It could be because of awkwardness: it’s easier to say no via an email than to look someone in the eye and try to put them off. Or it may be because we relate to each other more in person and thus feel more connected, warm, and willing to help. Future research could explore these elements further.</p>



<p>We may be asking for help online or via the phone because of the convenience of non-face-to-face techniques. But, while sending an email or making a call is easier than actually going to see someone, in doing so we inadvertently disadvantage ourselves. Asking for important favours in person, therefore, may be worth the trip.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/wild-cereal-farming-spread-ancient-europe-grain">A taste for wild cereal sowed farming’s spread in ancient Europe</a></h4>

              
                <p>People living along southeastern Europe’s Danube River around 11,500 years ago never planted a crop but still laid the foundation for the rise of farming in that region some 3,000 years later, a new study finds.</p>



<p>Hunter-gatherers living in this part of Europe avidly gathered and ate wild cereal grains for several millennia before migrants from southwest Asia introduced the cultivation of domesticated cereals and other plants, say archaeologist Emanuela Cristiani of Sapienza University of Rome and her colleagues. A <a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/72976">well-established taste for wild cereals</a> among hunter-gatherers of the central Balkan Peninsula, near what’s now Turkey, smoothed the way for farming to take root in Europe, the scientists conclude January 21 in <em>eLife</em>.</p>



<p>Previous chemical studies of human bones from Balkan sites indicated that ancient hunter-gatherers had eaten a lot of animal protein, mainly fish. Plant remains have not preserved well at those sites, leaving uncertain any role for grains on the menu of people who lived there.</p>



<p>It’s now evident that Balkan hunter-gatherers “balanced their diet with plant foods and did so for millennia before the arrival of agriculture,” Cristiani says.</p>





<p>The new findings align with earlier evidence that <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/agricultures-roots-spread-east-iran">hunter-gatherers in southwest Asia gradually domesticated wild plant species</a> from around 11,700 to 9,800 years ago, rather than rapidly adopting a farming lifestyle (<em>SN: 7/4/13</em>). But in the Balkans, hunter-gatherers consumed wild cereal species unrelated to domesticated strains later brought from southwest Asia, Cristiani’s team says.</p>



<p>Until now, the only site outside southwest Asia to yield evidence of hunter-gatherers collecting edible wild plants before the introduction of farming was a cave in Greece.</p>



<p>Cristiani’s group looked for microscopic signs of plant eating on the teeth of 60 individuals previously excavated at five sites in Serbia and Romania. Those sites range in age from several thousand years before the introduction of farming to several hundred years after cultivation began.</p>



<p>Food particles extracted from crusty deposits on the teeth of ancient hunter-gatherers contained starch granules and cell structures typical of regional wild cereal species. Starch granules from the same wild cereals were identified on the grinding surfaces of 17 stone implements, dating to as early as around 8,600 years ago, that were previously unearthed at one Balkan site. Hunter-gatherers at that location apparently pounded and ground wild cereals into a coarse flour, the researchers say.</p>



<p>Their findings provide the first direct evidence that southern European as well as southwestern Asian hunter-gatherers incorporated wild plants into their diets well before anyone cultivated crops, says archaeobotanist Elena Marinova of the State Office for Cultural Heritage Baden-Württemberg in Germany. For those ancient people, “the ‘paleolithic’ diet included starchy grains, not only meat and berries,” Marinova says.</p>

                <img width="140" height="110" src="https://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2022/02/BKD-photo-140x110.jpg" class="attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image" alt="" style="display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear:both;" /><p><i>Welcome to our </i><b><i>SDG Editorial Board Members</i></b><i> blog collection. We are hearing from the Editorial Board Members of the BMC Series journals whose work aligns with achieving the Sustainable Development Goals.

<hr />
<p>I am an applied microeconomist working in the fields of “global health” and “public health economics”. After serving the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) for nearly three years as a Prevention Effectiveness Fellow, I joined Augusta University as an Assistant Professor in the Institute of Public and Preventive Health. I primarily study the burden and determinants/risk-factors of noncommunicable diseases (NCDs) and NCD related healthcare management. The overarching goal of my research is to generate scientific evidence to facilitate strategizing policies and interventions for NCD prevention and control.</p>
<p>I have particular interest in studying the association between early life exposure to adverse events and later life health outcomes and risky health behaviors. As such, I study how events like child marriage (i.e., getting married before age 18 years) or adolescent pregnancy impact health outcomes during young adulthood and early middle age. Though many aspects of child marriage such as reproductive health outcomes and women’s empowerment have been widely studied, there is a dearth of evidence on the long-term health outcomes associated with the harmful practice of girl child marriage. In my research, I investigate whether <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/03630242.2021.2007198?journalCode=wwah20">child brides</a> and <a href="https://bmcpublichealth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12889-021-11488-z">adolescent mothers</a> at young adult age bear a different risk of having adverse health outcomes. The findings suggest that several chronic conditions such as hypertension, obesity, high blood pressure and high blood glucose comorbidity, etc. have strong association with child marriage and subsequent adolescent motherhood.</p>
<p><strong>Link to the SDGs</strong></p>
<p>This line of research is directly related to at least two UN SDG goals, namely Goals 3 and 5. One of the targets of SDG Goal 3 is to reduce premature mortality from non-communicable diseases (NCDs) by one third by 2030 through prevention and treatment (Target 3.4). My research identifies child brides and adolescent mothers as a vulnerable group with added risk of hypertension, which is a major risk factor of cardiovascular diseases (CVD) – the number one cause of premature deaths worldwide. Targeted interventions and tailored healthcare services, therefore, will improve cardiovascular health in this population and facilitate reducing premature NCD mortality. Given an estimated 650 million child brides currently living and having heightened risks of CVD, improving their health will have a substantial impact on attaining the Target 3.4.</p>
<p>Further, the findings imply that child marriage prevention will facilitate addressing the risk of downstream chronic health outcomes in women. This is related to another SDG target of eliminating the harmful practice of child marriage (Target 5.3). Linking child marriage with risk of downstream chronic conditions thus, inform opportunities for coordinated public health interventions to end child marriage and reducing the burden of NCDs.</p>
<p><strong>Challenges and future direction</strong></p>
<p>This is apparently a new line of research with limited existing evidence. The challenge, therefore, appeared to be convincing the scientific community and general audience that the associations are real and have important public health implications. I often received review comments stating that the catastrophic consequences of child marriage are well established and there is no need to do studies like this that examine any specific health impact. In response, my colleagues and I persistently convey the message that effective management of chronic health conditions entails identifying and extending the reach of healthcare services to the population at risk. As such, child brides and adolescent mothers, who suffer from various forms of socioeconomic deprivations, need apt policy attention to mitigate the risk of adverse health outcomes in later life.</p>
<p>This research is in early phase and there is long way to go. My team is working on a series of papers that relate various health issues at adult age with child marriage and adolescent pregnancy. In short run, success of this research can be deemed as effective dissemination of the findings that girl child marriage is associated with adverse health outcomes over the life course, to appropriate audiences including mass media, policy makers and development practitioners. In long run, success would be designing and implementing orchestrated public health interventions to improve child bride’s health outcomes and to eventually eliminate the harmful practice of child marriage.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2022/01/preprints-by-the-numbers/">The state of preprints at PLOS</a></h4>

              
                <p>In the weeks since <a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2022/01/plos-and-medrxiv/">announcing our expanded partnership with medRxiv</a>, we&rsquo;ve received lots of thoughtful questions from our authors, editors, and the scientific community. In this post, we aim to answer some of them.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But first, a quick recap of the role preprints have played at PLOS. While PLOS journals have always welcomed submissions with associated preprints, it wasn&rsquo;t until 2016 that we formalized our support for preprints in journal policy and began <a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2016/10/the-best-of-both-worlds-preprints-and-journals/">accepting incoming direct transfers from bioRxiv</a>. In 2018, we expanded that partnership and made it a 2-way street, <a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2018/04/one-small-step-for-preprints-one-giant-step-forward-for-open-scientific-communications/">giving authors the option</a> to have their manuscripts forwarded to bioRxiv as part of the submission process at select PLOS journals. In 2019 came direct transfers <a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2019/08/medrxiv-to-plos-direct-preprint-transfers/">from medRxiv</a> to PLOS, and just this month, <a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2022/01/plos-and-medrxiv/">facilitated posting from PLOS to medRxiv</a>.</p>



<p>The rates at which researchers have taken advantage of these integrations demonstrate how highly PLOS authors value preprints as a tool for disseminating their work. Since 2016, we have received close to 3,000<a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2022/01/preprints-by-the-numbers/#asterisk">*</a> incoming direct transfers from bioRxiv and medRxiv for consideration at PLOS. Since May 2018, more than 6,000 (13%) authors submitting life science research to PLOS reported that they have already posted their manuscript as a preprint, with nearly 9,000 (19%) opting in to have their manuscript forwarded to bioRxiv at the point of submission.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Both author-posted and opt-in rates for preprints vary by journal, research area, and geographic region, and have shifted over the years. In some subject-specific journals (<em>Pathogens</em>, <em>Genetics</em>) for example, rates spiked in 2020 before declining slightly in 2021, possibly relating to strong preprint support during the initial phases of SARS-CoV-2 pandemic.

<p>Now, on to your questions.</p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator">



<h2>Preprint questions &amp; answers</h2>



<h3 id="risk-to-public">Question: Could preprints potentially spread misinformation, or pose a potential risk to the public?</h3>



<p>As we all know, peer review and publication take time. Preprints let researchers share new work before and during the journal editorial process. Early sharing creates new opportunities for collaboration, while maximizing availability for vetting, feedback and review. But early sharing also poses potential risks: for example, the risk that readers may treat preprints uncritically, as proven fact, or that preprints may contain information that could be dangerous to the public. That&rsquo;s why <em>responsible </em>preprint posting is so important.</p>



<p>Responsible preprinting is a top priority for PLOS. Every preprint undergoes a thorough screening by bioRxiv, medRxiv, or PLOS editors. Basic checks include fit and appropriateness&mdash;for example: Does the preprint report research? Is it within scope for the server? Is it free from inflammatory or derogatory language? More complex checks by subject area experts look at potential concerns such as risk to public health, dual use research of concern (DURC), or risk of revealing patient identities.</p>



<p>The rigor of this screening process is demonstrable. Across PLOS on average 71%<a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2022/01/preprints-by-the-numbers/#asterisk">**</a> of the eligible manuscripts whose authors opted-in to have their manuscript forwarded to bioRxiv pass screening and go on to appear on the server.</p>



<p></p>



<h3 id="citations">Question: How does posting a preprint impact citations?</h3>



<p>Research suggests that early sharing via preprint is associated with<strong> increased attention and citations for the corresponding peer-reviewed publication</strong>. In one study, following a cohort of over 74,000 articles published from 2015 to 2018, articles with preprints enjoyed 49% higher Altmetric scores and 36% higher citations than those without (<a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/52646">Yu &amp; Hughey, 2019</a>). Another study, looking at bioRxiv preprints specifically, found that the articles with preprints had higher Altmetric and citation rates than articles in the same journals without associated preprints (<a href="https://direct.mit.edu/qss/article/1/2/618/96153/The-relationship-between-bioRxiv-preprints">Frazer, Momeni, Mayer &amp; Peters, 2020</a>).</p>



<p>Importantly, it&rsquo;s not yet clear whether this association is causal. There may be many factors at work. For example, perhaps authors who share preprints are also more likely to engage in other behaviors that are known to increase attention, like sharing open data or methods, presenting at conferences, or posting on social media. Maybe authors are likely to preprint their most promising work. Or, perhaps preprints aid in driving online traffic to published articles.</p>



<p>While the relationship between preprints and citations is interesting insofar as it demonstrates the quality and interest of the research being posted, the correlation between preprinting and citation rate is in some sense beside the point. The main aim of preprints is to increase the efficiency of research communication, and of the peer review process.</p>



<p></p>



<h3 id="publication">Question: What if preprints are never published in a journal, or are retracted after publication?</h3>



<p>There is no evidence that articles with preprints are less likely to be published, or more likely to be retracted from the journals in which they are published, compared with other articles. Indeed, at PLOS, we&rsquo;ve observed an equal or slightly higher acceptance rate for submitted manuscripts with an associated preprint. We aim to share detailed data in the future, after a more thorough analysis.&nbsp;</p>



<p></p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator">



<p>Many journals have embraced preprints, especially in response to the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. What makes PLOS&rsquo; preprint program notable is the workflow integration that we offer at scale. We treat preprint posting as a free author service by integrating it into the submission process with a single question. That ease and accessibility makes preprinting more practical for our authors, and helps to normalize the use of preprints in the communities that we serve.</p>

                <p><em>By</em> <a href="https://emmayoung.net/">Emma Young</a></p>



<p>For such a social species, we are <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2022/01/25/how-to-master-the-art-of-conversation-according-to-psychology/">surprisingly bad at judging conversations</a>. Now a new misapprehension can be added to the list: even after striking up a conversation with a stranger, we underestimate how much we’ll continue to enjoy it. There are potentially important implications, point out Michael Kardas at Northwestern University and colleagues: if we mistakenly avoid longer conversations, we could miss out not just on the chance to connect with someone, but even to gain a new friend.</p>



<span id="more-45229"></span>



<p>In the <em>Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, Interpersonal Relations and Group Processes</em>, the team <a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2022-16089-001">reports on five studies</a> involving a total of more than 1,000 participants and almost 1,000 spoken conversations, conducted face-to-face or via private video conferencing<em>. </em>In one study, the team asked pairs of strangers to chat face-to-face for a few minutes and rate their enjoyment of the conversation so far — and predict how much they’d enjoy further conversations with their partner. The researchers found that even though the participants enjoyed the initial conversation, they consistently underestimated how much they’d enjoy continuing to chat, with their actual enjoyment often remaining high in subsequent conversations. Their responses to a questionnaire suggested that this was because they didn’t appreciate how much they’d actually have to talk about. Or, as the researchers put it, “Conversation remained replete with material for longer than participants imagined.” Another study also found that people expected to become tired of conversing more quickly than they actually did.</p>



<p>The team did find an intervention that helped, however. Participants who were asked, after five minutes of chat, to think about and note down some topics for further conversations were less likely to underestimate their actual enjoyment of those sessions.</p>



<p>In the final study, the team found that when people got to choose the conversation duration that they thought they’d enjoy most, they were often wrong. Those who didn’t get to follow their preferred duration, but were instructed to keep talking to their partner for a full 25 minutes, reported greater enjoyment than those who’d been allowed to go for their own chosen shorter durations. The participants had been told that if they opted for a shorter chat, they’d have to then sit in silence, without other distractions, for the rest of the 25 minutes —&nbsp;something that other studies have found that many people really dislike. Those who chose short conversations apparently didn’t appreciate that further conversation would actually be better for their wellbeing.</p>



<p>Sometimes, we do have to make a choice in the real world between talking to a stranger and keeping to ourselves. Public transport is an obvious setting for this. Rarely do we have no alternative source of entertainment, however. Perhaps if those who’d said they preferred a short conversation had been given access to their phone after chatting, they would have enjoyed the 25 minutes more overall than those who had to keep talking.</p>



<p>It’s also worth noting that if the team did gather personality data, it wasn’t reported in this paper. Perhaps extraverts are better at judging their likely enjoyment of a longer conversation with a stranger. Perhaps introverts enjoy longer conversations less. However, some of the earlier work on conversation has found that <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2014/08/15/were-happier-when-we-chat-to-strangers-but-our-instinct-is-to-ignore-them/">talking to strangers makes not only extraverts but also introverts feel better</a>, so perhaps this isn’t the case. Only further research will tell.</p>



<p>For now, though, “The current findings mark one of the first attempts to unpack the time course of enjoyment in conversation,” the team writes. And while we tend to think that conversations with strangers will quickly grow dull, if, as these studies suggest, this isn’t the case, there are immediate practical lessons.</p>



<p>Still, not all the participants who expected to enjoy a conversation less and less were wrong. And earlier work has found that <a href="https://www.pnas.org/content/118/10/e2011809118">conversations rarely end when we’d like them to</a>. So if you’re thinking that you might take these new findings to heart, and throw yourself into longer conversations with strangers, but are worried about how to get out of them, if necessary, you might also bear in mind <a href="https://www.vox.com/science-and-health/22368306/social-awkwardness-conversations-adam-mastroianni">tips on how to cut a conversation short.</a></p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/frog-leg-regeneration-new-device-regrow-amputation">A new device helps frogs regrow working legs after an amputation</a></h4>

              
                <p>The cells of adult frogs seem to remember how to regrow lost legs, and a new chemical kick starter helps them hop to it.</p>



<p>Scientists have <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/nail-generating-tissue-also-regrows-fingertips">been seeking ways to spur</a> the body to regrow limbs to help people that have undergone an amputation (<em>SN: 6/12/13</em>). Like adult humans, fully grown frogs have a limited ability to replace lost body parts. But a new treatment — a device that delivers a drug cocktail — <a href="http://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.abj2164">jump-starts and improves limb regeneration after amputation in frogs</a>, researchers report in the Jan. 26 <em>Science Advances</em>.</p>



<p>“The cells of the frog already know how to make frog legs,” having done so when the animal was a developing embryo, says Michael Levin, a developmental biologist at Tufts University in Medford, Mass. “Our goal is to figure out how to convince them to do it again.”</p>



<p>Levin’s team amputated the right back legs of 115 adult African clawed frogs (<em>Xenopus laevis</em>) at the knee. Roughly one-third of those frogs received “BioDomes,” silicone sleeves that cover the wound. To another third of the frogs, researchers attached BioDomes holding a silk-based gel that contained five chemicals, including a growth hormone, a nerve growth promoter and an anti-inflammatory substance. The BioDomes stayed on for 24 hours and then were removed from the frogs’ legs. The remaining third didn’t receive any treatments before being placed back in their tanks.</p>

<p>In animals that received the drug cocktail, “around the four-month mark, we started to see a slight difference in the leg shape,” says Nirosha Murugan, a cancer biologist now at Algoma University in Sault Ste. Marie, Canada. “With time, that bud … started to take shape into a whole leg.”</p>



<p>After 18 months, the frogs that received the chemicals had regrown the limbs and had nubs where toes would typically grow. The amputees kicked, stood and pushed off the walls of their tanks using their regrown legs, Levin says.</p>





<p>The BioDome itself promoted some regeneration: The stiffness and pressure it creates at the wound seem to lead to conditions that spur growth, Murugan says. But frogs that received the BioDome with drugs grew longer legs with thicker bones. They also had more blood vessels and nerves. And compared with the BioDome-only group, frogs that received the drug mix showed greater sensitivity to touch when their limbs were lightly prodded. Frogs in the control group grew spiky flaps — basically stumps with no function — at the wound site.</p>



<p>“It’s actually remarkable that just a single treatment on one day can cause all this change,” Murugan says.</p>

<h3>Lost legs</h3>



<p>Over 18 months, frogs grew new limbs after an amputation (site of the amputation marked with dashed lines, left column). One-third of the frogs didn’t receive any treatment and grew a spiky stump (one shown in top row). Another third received BioDome devices that covered the injury for 24 hours (middle row). The remaining frogs received the BioDome and a drug cocktail (bottom row). This group grew the longest limbs with the greatest bone density and more blood vessels and nerves. They also developed legs with a paddlelike shape (yellow arrow) with toelike buds (blue arrow), as opposed to the other groups that grew only spiky flaps (pink arrows).</p>

<p>This first attempt at using a chemical cocktail to coax limb regrowth is “a great start,” says John Barker, an orthopedic researcher who recently retired from Goethe University Frankfurt and was not part of the work. With this approach, he says, “there’s no end to what you could try.”</p>



<p>The team has moved on to similar work in mice, using the same cocktail and new ones. Levin’s research also points to <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/building-body-electric">electricity’s role in shaping the growth of body parts</a>, so the researchers are adding compounds to the cocktail that alter the electrical state of cells (<em>SN: 12/8/11</em>).</p>



<p>Someday, scientists want to be able to regrow human limbs and organs. As with the frogs’ legs, human bodies know how to make hands, for example, Barker says. Children under the age of 10 or so can even regrow lost fingertips. In health care, “this whole story of regeneration changes everything,” Barker says. “Instead of treating symptoms, you could literally cure a disease.” For instance, regenerated heart tissue could replace damaged tissue to improve heart function.</p>



<p>Limbs, however, are more complicated because several types of tissue must coordinate. And researchers lack fundamental information on how bodies form their parts.</p>



<p>“We don’t understand how collections of cells solve problems” to decide what to build and when to stop, Levin says. “Cracking regenerative medicine is going to require us to do much better about understanding that.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/animal-human-organ-transplants-pig-kidney-heart-history">Will animal-to-human organ transplants overcome their complicated history?</a></h4>

              
                <p>A 57-year-old Maryland man has now survived just over three weeks with the transplanted heart of a genetically engineered pig. His doctor has hailed the operation as a <a href="https://www.umms.org/ummc/news/2022/first-successful-transplant-of-porcine-heart-into-adult-human-heart">“breakthrough surgery”</a> that could help solve the organ shortage crisis. But from a scientific standpoint, it’s too early in the game to know how much it moves the ball.</p>



<p>The use of animal organs for humans is an idea with a <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/xeno-solution">long, dramatic and often disappointing history</a> (<em>SN: 11/4/95</em>). There’s an old saying about xenotransplantation, as the field is known, says Joe Leventhal, a surgeon who heads the kidney transplant program at Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine in Chicago. “It&#8217;s just around the corner. The problem is, it&#8217;s a very, very, very long corner.”</p>



<p>But a rash of new experiments, including three involving pig kidneys transplanted into people being kept temporarily alive on ventilators, has provided tantalizing evidence that achieving the decades-old ambition may finally be in reach.</p>



<p>The recent human operations come after an extensive effort to develop genetically altered pigs with organs that might avoid abrupt rejection, along with further refining of drugs that suppress the immune system and boost survival. That said, the Maryland heart operation was a Hail Mary rescue attempt and not part of a clinical trial — the kind of carefully designed study that is ultimately needed to show whether pig organs can function in humans, and do so safely.</p>





<p>One case can provide some valuable information about how the body responds to the organ, says Karen Maschke, a bioethics scholar at the Hastings Center in Garrison, N.Y., who is editor of <em>Ethics &amp; Human Research</em>. “You may find stuff that you didn&#8217;t expect to find,” she says.</p>



<p>But a single snapshot of data doesn’t have enough context to draw conclusions, especially when it involves a gravely ill patient and brand-new technology. Without a study comparing several carefully selected patients, it’s hard to know whether one individual’s experience is typical.</p>



<p>Yet the latest flurry of pig-to-human transplant experiments could help open the door to the kinds of clinical trials that researchers want. That’s the only way to significantly advance the science, says heart surgeon David Cooper of Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston, who has long researched the idea of xenotransplantation. “We&#8217;ll learn much more if we are doing clinical cases than if we are staying in the laboratory.”</p>



<h3>High on the hog</h3>



<p>If clinical trials ultimately prove successful, animals could help ease a critical shortage of donor organs. Of the more than <a href="https://optn.transplant.hrsa.gov/data/view-data-reports/national-data/">106,000 Americans waiting for a transplant</a>, around 90,000 need a kidney. Many will die before one is available.</p>



<p>Doctors have previously turned to animal organs in bold, headline-grabbing endeavors. Famed Houston heart surgeon Denton Cooley transplanted a sheep heart as a desperate move to save a dying man in the 1960s; the man’s body quickly rejected the organ.</p>



<p>One of the most high-profile tries at xenotransplantation occurred in 1984 when doctors at Loma Linda University Medical Center in California sewed a <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/baboon-human-transplant-draws-mixed-reviews">baboon heart into a 2-week-old baby</a> born with a fatal cardiac defect (<em>SN: 11/3/84</em>). Baby Fae, as she was known, lived for 21 days and her surgery left a wake of controversy. Some medical ethicists called the operation a <a href="https://jme.bmj.com/content/medethics/11/4/178.full.pdf">“beastly business”</a> that lacked moral clarity. Scientists “<a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/389254?resultClick=1">beat a hasty retreat back to the laboratory</a>,” according to a 1995 report in the <em>Journal of the American Medical Association</em>.</p>

<p>More recently, scientists have focused on pigs, largely because porcine organs are about the size of adult humans’, and the animals are already raised on an industrial scale. Still, the feasibility of the idea was thrown into doubt with the discovery in the 1980s that pig cells are coated with a type of sugar molecule, <a href="https://rupress.org/jem/article/160/5/1519/23465/A-unique-natural-human-IgG-antibody-with-anti">called alpha-gal</a>, that strongly triggers the human immune system.</p>



<p>The field also experienced a setback with the discovery in the 1990s that the swine genome contains <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nm0397-282">embedded viruses</a>, snippets of viral genetic code woven into pigs’ genetic instruction books. (It’s not just a pig trait; these kinds of viral genes <a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fimmu.2018.02039/full#B1">make up an estimated 8 percent</a> of the human genome too.) The viruses, called porcine endogenous retroviruses, don’t bother pigs but might cause problems after suddenly finding themselves in another species.</p>



<p>In the early 2000s, researchers reported the creation of <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.1078942">genetically modified pigs</a> lacking alpha-gal, making them theoretically more compatible with the human immune system than a hog straight from the farm. That announcement set off attempts to raise alpha-gal-free animals, most notably in the United States by Revivicor, a company owned by United Therapeutics, based in Blacksburg, Va. Then, in 2020, the possibility of pig-to-human transplants took a giant leap forward, when, for the first time, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration <a href="https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/fda-approves-first-its-kind-intentional-genomic-alteration-line-domestic-pigs-both-human-food">approved Revivicor pigs</a> for human use.</p>



<p>Xenotransplantation also got a boon from CRISPR/Cas9 gene-editing technology and its remarkable ability to snip genes at will. Using CRISPR, scientists can <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/gene-editing-creates-virus-free-piglets">trim the unwanted viral genes from pigs</a> (<em>SN: 8/10/17</em>). “Gene editing with CRISPR has just really helped accelerate the field in sort of a warp drive,” Leventhal says.</p>



<p>In recent experiments, pig kidneys and hearts have been successfully transplanted into baboons. Though the baboons died within days in early xenotransplantation attempts, researchers reported in 2018 that <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/baboons-survive-6-months-after-getting-pig-heart-transplant">transplanted pig hearts kept beating</a> in the chests of two baboons for about six months, a record at the time (<em>SN: 12/5/18</em>). Other similar experiments have replicated that <a href="https://www.jhltonline.org/article/S1053-2498(20)31556-4/fulltext">survival time</a>.</p>



<p>Then, in October 2021, scientists from NYU Langone Health in New York City made the jump to humans: In a test, they grafted a Revivicor kidney onto <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/xenotransplantation-pig-human-kidney-transplant">a person who was clinically brain-dead and watched the organ function for 54 hours</a>, presumably long enough to detect any signs of immediate rejection (<em>SN: 10/22/21</em>). Less than two months later, the same surgical team repeated the experiment. A <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/ajt.16930">third such transplant</a> from researchers at the University of Alabama at Birmingham, this time into the abdomen of a man kept temporarily alive by a ventilator following a motorcycle accident, was described January 20 in the <em>American Journal of Transplantation</em>.</p>



<p>None of the kidneys transplanted in people appeared to provoke immediate immune rejection, and the organs even began to produce urine, doctors reported. Given the overwhelming need for kidneys, and proof-of-concept renal tests already done, most experts predicted that the first modern patient to get a xenotransplant would need a kidney.</p>



<p>Then came the unexpected news of David Bennett.</p>



<h3>‘I want to live’</h3>



<p>Bennett was suffering from acute heart failure and did not qualify for the human heart transplant list. On New Year’s Eve, the FDA gave doctors from the University of Maryland Medical Center permission to transplant the pig heart through a <a href="https://www.fda.gov/news-events/public-health-focus/expanded-access">special protocol</a>, sometimes called compassionate use, that allows very sick people emergency access to experimental drugs or devices — either because the patient doesn’t qualify for any study of the drugs or because no study exists. Bennett’s new heart also came from a Revivicor pig.</p>



<p>In a statement issued by the hospital, Bennett said he consented to the experimental surgery because he was simply out of options. He was bedridden, and no hospital would offer him a heart transplant, at least in part because he had a history of not following medical advice. &#8220;It was either die or do this transplant,” he said. “I want to live.” The eight-hour operation was performed on January 7.</p>

<p>A little over three weeks later, Bennett is gaining strength, says Muhammad Mohiuddin, a surgeon who directs the cardiac xenotransplantation program at the hospital and who was part of the surgical team. Everyday accomplishments, like talking with the staff about football playoffs, are tiny victories.</p>



<p>“We are counting all these smaller wins and hope this heart will keep supporting him,” Mohiuddin says. The heart is strong enough that the doctors have had to dampen its power because it was too much for Bennett’s body, weakened from lying in bed for weeks. “We put a Ferrari engine in a 1960 car,” Mohiuddin says.</p>



<p>Still, Cooper, from Massachusetts General, said he was surprised when he learned that the first living pig-to-human transplant patient received a heart, not a kidney. “What are they going to do if this graft slowly begins to fail?” he asks. “There’s going to be a little bit of a problem.”</p>



<p>“I thought it would be the kidney first. Because if that fails — say you get rejection that you didn&#8217;t expect, or you get infection that you can&#8217;t manage — you can take the kidney out, stop all the immunosuppressive therapy and put the patient back on dialysis.” A heart transplant is not so reversible.</p>



<p>Cooper and surgeon Hidetaka Hara, who were at the University of Alabama at Birmingham together, had suggested that the <a href="https://www.thelancet.com/action/showPdf?pii=S2352-3964%2821%2900355-8">first xenotransplant should be a step-by-step clinical trial with four patients waiting for a kidney</a>. The trial would work like this: Three months after the first patient receives a transplant, perform the operation in a second patient if the first person isn’t having complications. If those two are doing well, transplant a third pig kidney three months later, and a fourth three months after that, the pair laid out in September in <em>EBioMedicine</em>. “So over the course of a year,” Cooper says, “you’ve followed up four patients and you can see whether are they all doing well or are there complications.”</p>



<p>Starting a clinical trial with kidneys also makes sense, Cooper says, because the need is so much greater. Around <a href="https://www.organdonor.gov/learn/organ-donation-statistics/detailed-description#fig1">83 percent of the transplant</a> waiting list are people who need kidneys; 3 percent need a heart.</p>



<p>That’s why eGenesis, a company in Cambridge, Mass., is focusing its research efforts on kidneys. “It’s where the dominant need is,” says Mike Curtis, the company’s president of research and development. eGenesis, which is raising gene-edited, immune-compatible pigs, hopes to begin a clinical trial of six to 10 patients with transplanted pig kidneys around 2024.</p>



<p>Mohiuddin says that the reason he performed a heart operation is simple: He’s a cardiac surgeon, and the patient was dying. “My 30-year interest has been only in hearts,” he says. His research team has approached the FDA for permission to do a clinical trial, he says, but the agency wants more consistent data from baboon studies first. “We hope to get that permission,” he says. “This was just to save Mr. Bennett’s life.”</p>



<h3>One and not done</h3>



<p>Should Bennett check out of the hospital and go home, that high-profile milestone could serve a purpose beyond allowing him more time with his family: It could help persuade the FDA to green-light a larger, scientifically designed trial, Cooper says.</p>



<p>If Bennett continues doing well, doctors “may be able to get a handful of [heart] patients done over the next few months. And then they go back to the FDA and say, look, these patients generally did well. Now can we do a proper series, where we take patients on our own waiting list and do the transplants?”</p>



<p>Leventhal, the surgeon from Northwestern, has the same hope about approved clinical trials. “The only way that you&#8217;re going to see whether these organs provide meaningful function over the long term in humans, in a way that would justify their use, is to transplant them into humans and follow them longer-term.”</p>



<p>Still, it remains to be seen whether that will occur under compassionate use, as Bennett received, or in formal studies. The FDA’s expanded access provision was designed to help people obtain drugs and procedures that they couldn’t normally get. “Whether it should have been used in the case of an organ is an interesting ethical and regulatory and policy question,” Maschke, the bioethicist, says.</p>



<p>“One of the problems with going the route they did is that there are probably hundreds of heart patients in the country who are not on a waiting list because they’re too sick,” Maschke says. “Some of those folks may say, ‘I&#8217;ll never take an animal organ,’ but some of them might say, ‘Yes, I would take a pig heart. I want to do this too. Can you get me access?’”</p>

<h4>Waiting game</h4>



<p>In the United States, the large majority of people on the transplant waiting list need kidneys. Kidney transplants are also the most common type of transplant performed.</p>

<p>But opening the floodgates could make it harder to find volunteers for clinical studies. And in some cases, it could backfire. That’s what happened in the 1990s when doctors started offering women with advanced breast cancer massive doses of chemotherapy followed by bone marrow transplantation to restore their collapsed immune systems. Thousands of women received the experimental treatment — so many that scientists had trouble recruiting for studies. And when the scientific trials were finally done, the treatment showed no benefit.</p>



<p>That’s why there’s often a concern about moving too fast, “because you don&#8217;t want to derail the science — and the science is incremental,” Maschke says.</p>



<p>For now, pig-to-human transplantation has logistical issues that will help restrict its use. For one, the painstakingly engineered pigs are hard to come by. In addition to their rare genetic pedigree, they must be raised in sterile environments so they don’t pick up any microbes that might be transferred to humans. Another possible hurdle: Animal rights groups have decried the idea of pigs as spare parts for humans as “cruel and dangerous,” a sentiment that society will need to square with the urgent medical need.</p>



<p>But first, doctors need to know if xenotransplantation is even possible, or will once again end in failure. “What we don&#8217;t know is, how long and how well will these organs work in patients?” Leventhal says. “The only way we&#8217;re going to assess that is through transplanting them.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/top-10-science-anniversaries-2022">Here are the Top 10 science anniversaries of 2022</a></h4>

              
                <p>Even though it’s only even odds that 2022 will turn out to be less of a disaster than 2021 (or 2020), at least 2022 is the best recent year for compiling a Top 10 list of science anniversaries.</p>



<p>Curiously, many of those anniversaries are of deaths: the astronomer William Herschel for instance, who died in 1822; Hermann Rorschach, Alexander Graham Bell and the mathematician Sophie Bryant (all in 1922); and Louis Leakey (1972).</p>



<p>But there are also some notable firsts (the original slide rule, for instance) and births, including the scientist who illuminated how science could save society from devastating infectious diseases. Honorable mentions go to the birthdays of physicists Rudolf Clausius (200th), Leon Lederman (100th) and C.N. Yang (100th). They just missed edging out the oldest anniversary, a death from an earlier millennium:</p>



<h4>10. Al-Nayrīzī, 1,100th anniversary of death</h4>





<p>Abū’l-‘Abbās al-Faḍl ibn Ḥātim al-Nayrīzī was a <a href="https://www.encyclopedia.com/science/dictionaries-thesauruses-pictures-and-press-releases/al-nayriz">Persian mathematician and astronomer</a>, probably born around A.D. 865 in the town of Nayriz (in present-day Iran), which is why he became known as al-Nayrīzī. He died in 922 or thereabouts (close enough for Top 10 purposes). He got a job in Baghdad with the caliph al-Mu‘taḍid, writing treatises on math and weather, among other topics.</p>



<p>Unfortunately, many of al-Nayrīzī’s writings were long ago lost. But other writers mention his works and report that he was a master of astronomy and geometry. Among his surviving works is a translation and commentary on Euclid’s <em>Elements</em>. Al-Nayrīzī also attempted a proof of Euclid’s famous postulate about parallel lines never meeting. One of Al-Nayrīzī’s treatises for the caliph discussed how to determine the distance to upright objects. Had golf been invented yet, the caliph would have used such knowledge to calculate the distance to the flagstick without need of a GPS app.</p>



<h4>9. Invention of mathematical weather forecasting, 100th anniversary</h4>



<p><a href="https://www.encyclopedia.com/people/social-sciences-and-law/sociology-biographies/lewis-fry-richardson">Lewis Fry Richardson</a>, a mathematician who later turned to psychology, worked early in his career at England’s National Peat Industries. He was given the task of calculating optimal designs of drainage systems for peat moss subjected to different amounts of rain. He worked out the equations and then realized they could be applied to other problems, such as predicting the weather.</p>



<p>In the years leading up to World War I, he worked on a book, to be titled <em>Weather Prediction by Numerical Process</em>. He showed how values for temperature, humidity, air pressure and other weather data from one day could be processed by his equations to make a forecast for the next day. He took a break to be an ambulance driver during the war and then finished his book, published in 1922.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/sn-magazine/august-19-1922">As <em>Science News-Letter</em> reported that year</a>, one U.S. Weather Bureau scientist believed the book to show “that meteorology has become an exact science.” Unfortunately, to make the next day’s forecast from one day’s data took Richardson six weeks of calculation time. Only decades later did modern electronic computers make the mathematics of weather forecasting practical, and sometimes useful.</p>





<h4>8. Invention of slide rule, 400th anniversary</h4>



<p><a></a><a href="https://www.encyclopedia.com/people/history/historians-miscellaneous-biographies/william-oughtred">William Oughtred</a>, born in England in 1575, became a priest and part-time mathematician and tutor. In 1631 he wrote a book summarizing arithmetic and algebra, which became widely popular, later earning lavish praise from Isaac Newton.</p>



<p>Nine years before his book, Oughtred had designed the first slide rule. In 1614 John Napier had invented logarithms, showing how multiplication could be accomplished by addition. Six years later the astronomer Edmund Gunter had the bright idea of marking numbers on a straightedge proportional to their logarithms. Multiplication could then be performed by using a compass (the caliper kind, not for finding north) to find the answer by measuring the distances between the numbers to be multiplied.</p>



<p>In 1622, Oughtred had the even brighter idea of placing two such rulers next to each other. Sliding one along the other to properly position the numbers of interest allowed him to read the product of a multiplication right off one of the rulers. Oughtred later designed a circular slide rule, but one of his students claimed to have had that idea first, initiating a nasty priority dispute.</p>



<p>Further advances in slide rule design, incorporating things like cubes and trigonometric functions, made slide rules the premier computing devices of the 19th and 20th centuries — UNTIL electronic calculators came along, sadly depriving slide rules the opportunity to make it to age 400. But some people alive today once used slide rules, and probably still have one in a box somewhere.</p>



<h4>7. Maria Goeppert Mayer, 50th anniversary of death</h4>



<p><a href="https://www.encyclopedia.com/people/science-and-technology/physics-biographies/maria-goeppert-mayer">Maria Goeppert</a> was born in what is now Poland in 1906. Encouraged by her father, a university professor, to pursue higher education, Maria chose mathematics. But in the mid-1920s her fascination with a newfangled idea called quantum mechanics induced her to shift to physics. After earning her Ph.D., she married a chemist (Joseph Mayer) and moved to the United States. She was allowed to teach classes where her husband was on the faculty (first at Johns Hopkins, later at Columbia and then Chicago) but not offered a job of her own. She was free to pursue research projects, though, often in collaboration with her husband or other scientists, and she produced important work on many topics at the interface of quantum physics and chemistry.</p>



<p>She was a master of the math needed to understand spectroscopy; her studies of the light emitted by the newly discovered transuranic elements in the 1940s showed that they belonged in a chemical family related to the rare-earth elements — an essential clue to the proper positioning of the transuranics in the periodic table. After World War II, she began studying nuclear physics and soon deduced the existence of a shell-like structure for the arrangement of nucleons (protons and neutrons) in the atomic nucleus. Her findings complemented similar work by Hans Jensen, with whom she later collaborated in writing a book on the nuclear shell model. Jensen and Goeppert Mayer shared <a href="https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/physics/1963/summary/">the 1963 Nobel in physics</a> for that work.</p>

<p>Her shell model research was aided by a suggestion from Enrico Fermi, the physicist famous for his work on the secret Manhattan Project to build the atomic bomb. That was only fair, as when Fermi disappeared from Columbia University in 1941 to work on the bomb, Goeppert Mayer was hurriedly recruited to teach his class. In 1960, Goeppert Mayer finally was awarded a full-time primetime job of her own at the University of California, San Diego, but shortly thereafter she suffered a stroke, limiting her ability to do research in the years before her death in 1972.</p>



<h4>6. Aage Bohr, 100th birthday</h4>



<p>Niels Bohr was awarded the Nobel Prize in physics in 1922, the same year as the birth of <a href="https://history.aip.org/phn/11707003.html">his son Aage</a>. Aage grew up surrounded by physicists (who came from around the world to study with his father) and so naturally became a physicist himself. During World War II, Aage accompanied his father to the United States to work on the Manhattan Project, afterwards returning to his native Denmark to earn his Ph.D. at the University of Copenhagen. During that time Aage turned his attention to a problem with the atomic nucleus.</p>



<p>His father’s theory that a nucleus behaves much like a drop of liquid had been applied successfully in explaining nuclear fission. But more recent work by Maria Goeppert Mayer (remember her?) showed that nuclei had an inner shell-like structure, suggesting ordered arrangements of individual particles, not collective, liquidlike behavior. Aage developed a new theoretical view, showing that his father’s view could be reconciled with Goeppert Mayer’s shell model. He then worked on experiments that corroborated it and shared <a href="https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/physics/1975/summary/">the 1975 physics Nobel</a> “for the discovery of the connection between collective motion and particle motion in atomic nuclei and the development of the theory of the structure of the atomic nucleus based on this connection.”</p>



<h4>5. Gregor Mendel, 200th birthday</h4>



<p>Born July 22, 1822 to a family of farmers in what is now the Czech Republic, <a href="https://www.encyclopedia.com/people/science-and-technology/genetics-and-genetic-engineering-biographies/gregor-johann-mendel">Johann Mendel</a> preferred &nbsp;higher education to farming, enrolling in a philosophy program properly complemented with math and physics. When the time came to return home and take charge of the family farm, he opted instead to enter a monastery (where he adopted the monastic name Gregor). He did not particularly enjoy his priestly duties, though, so he got a job as a teacher, which required him to enter the University of Vienna for advanced science education. There, in addition to more math and physics, he encountered botany. Later he returned to the monastery, where he applied his botanical skills to investigating patterns in the physical features of successive generations of pea plants.</p>



<p>In 1866 he published results implying the existence of “differentiating characters” (now known as genes) that combined in different ways when transmitted by parents to offspring. Apparently nobody very astute read his paper, not even Charles Darwin, who would have been intrigued by Mendel’s mention that his work was relevant to “the history of the evolution of organic forms.” Only at the dawn of the 20th century was Mendel’s work translated into English and then recognized for its importance to heredity, evolution and biology in general.</p>



<h4>4. Pioneer 10, 50th anniversary of launch</h4>



<p>Of all the robotic spacecraft launched from Earth into space, <a href="https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/missions/pioneer-10/in-depth/">Pioneer 10</a> was truly the pioneer. It was the first craft to fly beyond the orbit of Mars and the first to exceed the distance of the solar system’s outermost planet, Neptune. Launched March 2, 1972, Pioneer 10’s mission was to visit Jupiter to take some cool snapshots of the giant planet and a few of its moons. Pioneer’s escape velocity from Earth surpassed 51,000 kilometers per hour (about 32,000 miles per hour), at the time a solar system speed record for any flying machine or bird. After dodging asteroids (most of them anyway) on its journey, Pioneer 10 reached the solar system’s largest planet in late 1973, passing within 131,000 kilometers (about 81,000 miles) on December 4.</p>

<p>Pioneer continued transmitting signals back to Earth until 1997, when budget cuts forced NASA to stop listening except for an occasional check-in. The very last signal came on January 23, 2003, from 7.6 billion miles away. By now Pioneer 10 is roughly 12 billion miles away, headed in the direction of the star Aldebaran. It will arrive in a mere 2 million years or so. If any Aldebaranians encountering it can decipher the sketches of a man and woman and the map revealing the point of origin, perhaps they will refuel it and send it back.</p>



<h4>3. Insulin treats diabetes, 100th anniversary</h4>



<p>In a century of medical miracles, one of the earliest and most dramatic was the discovery of insulin for treating diabetes. Diabetes had been recognized as a serious disease in ancient times. By the 20th century, scientists suspected that the pancreas produced a substance that helped metabolize carbohydrates; a malfunctioning pancreas meant a person could not extract energy from carbohydrates in food, resulting in dangerously high blood sugar levels while depriving the body of needed energy. It was nearly always fatal in children, and adults diagnosed with diabetes could hope for only a few more years of life.</p>



<p>As <em>Science News-Letter</em> reported in 1922, diabetes <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/sn-magazine/october-28-1922">ranked “with cancer in fatality and incurability.”</a> But in that year, a young doctor reported success in treating diabetes with a substance secreted by the pancreas. That doctor, <a href="https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/medicine/1923/banting/biographical/">Frederick Banting</a>, had tried the idea with dogs the year before and gave the <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3714061/">first insulin injection to a human</a>, a 14-year-old boy, in January 1922. Banting originally used insulin purified from animals; in the decades since, researchers have engineered more sophisticated forms for human use. But even with the animal insulin, success was so dramatic that Banting and his lab director John Macleod were awarded the <a href="https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/medicine/1923/summary/">Nobel Prize in physiology or medicine in 1923</a>.</p>



<h4>2. <em>Science News</em>, 100th birthday</h4>



<p>In its first year of providing news of science to the world, the organization then known as Science Service transmitted a weekly package of mimeographed pages (labeled Science News Bulletin) to newspapers and other media around the country. But soon other groups (such as libraries) as well as individuals began to request the package, and so Science Service initiated a new strategy with issue No. 50. On March 13, 1922, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/sn-magazine/march-13-1922"><em>Science News-Letter</em> was born</a>, with a new masthead offering subscriptions for $5 per year, postpaid. Its first article: an account of a U.S. Department of Commerce report on the allocation of radio wavelengths. The report assured everybody that “widespread use of radio for the broadcasting of public information and other matters of general interest” would be forthcoming. In 1966 the magazine dropped “Letter” and became <em>Science News</em>, providing an excuse for another centennial celebration in 2066.</p>



<h4>1. Louis Pasteur, 200th birthday</h4>



<p>Born in France in December 1822, <a href="https://www.encyclopedia.com/people/science-and-technology/chemistry-biographies/louis-pasteur">Louis Pasteur</a> was not a precocious youth. His interests tended toward art, but later some inspiring lectures shifted his attention to chemistry, and he became one of the greatest chemists of all time. Also one of the greatest biologists. And although he received no medical education, he provided the foundation for modern medicine’s ability to fight disease.</p>

<p>Pasteur’s understanding of microorganisms led to the recognition of their capacity to damage human health. His tenacity in conducting rigorous experiments and his pugnacious public promotion of his findings established the germ theory of disease and encouraged new methods of hygiene. Time after time he was called on to devise solutions for perplexing problems facing various industries. He saved the silk industry. He showed how to prevent wine from going sour, and how to make milk safe to drink. He devised vaccines for various diseases, including one to cure rabies. No one person in history is more responsible than Pasteur for preserving human health and preventing unnecessary deaths. He is lucky he was born 200 years ago, though. If he were around today, he’d be getting death threats.</p>

                <p><em>By</em> <a href="https://twitter.com/mattbwarren">Matthew Warren</a></p>



<p>We often feel regret when we learn that an opportunity we rejected has turned out really well. Think about that investment you didn’t make that has now shot up in value, for example, or the person you never asked out who is now living a happily married life.</p>



<p>But what happens when we never find out the outcome of that potential, rejected opportunity? If we don’t know what could have been, then it might seem like we shouldn’t feel much regret. But according to a <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/09567976211032657">new series of studies</a> in <em>Psychological Science </em>by Daniel Feiler from Darmouth College and Johannes Müller-Trede from the University of Navarra, we sometimes feel <em>more </em>regret in these situations.</p>



<span id="more-45205"></span>



<p>Here’s the logic behind the team’s investigation. Say you have to make a decision where you are faced with many different options — ordering from a menu at a fancy restaurant, for instance. You whittle it down to two possibilities that look particularly appetising, the salmon and the steak, before ultimately deciding to go for the steak. This is going to be one of the best meals of your life, you think, mouth watering as you see the waiter bring out the dish. But when you bite into the steak, it is merely OK, and nothing to write home about. You have overestimated how good it will be, and now you feel let down. If only you had gone for the salmon, you think…</p>



<p>But there’s a problem with this line of thinking: the salmon might have also been a disappointment. In fact, precisely <em>because </em>you were drawn to it so much, it’s quite possible that you overestimated its attractiveness, just as you did for the steak. However, because you didn’t order the salmon, you’ll continue to think it would have been amazing — and to feel regret.</p>



<p>The team’s work suggests that this idealisation of a rejected opportunity — and subsequent regret — is quite common. In the first study, 800 participants saw nine blurred faces (either men or women, depending on each participant’s preference), and had to choose their top two favourites. They then had to select which of these two would be the most attractive when unblurred.</p>



<p>All participants then saw their chosen face, now visible, alongside the rejected face. For half of the participants, this rejected face remained blurred, but for the other half it was made visible too. They all then rated how much regret they felt about rejecting this face, and rated the attractiveness of both the chosen and rejected face (or <em>predicted </em>attractiveness if the rejected face was still blurred).</p>



<p>The team found that when the rejected face remained blurred, participants were more likely to report feeling regret about their choice, and also expected the face to be more attractive compared to the actual attractiveness ratings given by participants for whom it was visible. In other words, participants who never found out what the rejected face looked like overestimated its attractiveness, and this seemed to lead to feelings of regret about not choosing it. However, participants who saw this face had a more realistic view of its attractiveness, and that tempered feelings of regret.</p>



<p>The researchers reported similar results using a different set-up. Participants pretended they were recruiting for a consulting firm, and were given 10 candidates, each of whom had been assigned scores based on an interview and test. They were told that these scores provided some indication of the candidate&#8217;s ability, but weren’t perfect, and could be a bit higher or lower than the their <em>true</em> ability.</p>



<p>Participants had to shortlist two candidates, and then decide which to hire. After making their choice, they were given a score representing their chosen candidate&#8217;s true ability. Half of the participants were also shown the rejected candidate’s true ability, while the other half were just shown this candidate’s interview and test scores again. Finally, all participants were asked how much regret they felt about passing on the rejected candidate.</p>



<p>The results showed that participants who never found out the rejected candidate’s true ability were more likely to report regret, and also reported a higher degree of regret, than those who did find out. A subsequent study suggested that this was again because they were overestimating the “attractiveness” of the rejected candidate — in this case, they thought that the candidate’s true ability was higher than it actually was.</p>



<p>This makes sense: the most attractive candidates would be those with high scores, but these would also tend to be people whose scores were overestimates of their true ability. Participants would be disappointed in finding out that their chosen candidate wasn’t as skilled as they thought, but might not realise that the same would likely be true of their rejected candidate.</p>



<p>Overall, then, it seems that regret might be quite a common experience when we don’t know exactly what would have happened if we had chosen a different path — particularly if we feel let down by the choice we <em>did </em>make. So in these situations is useful to bear in mind that we’ve probably overestimated how good that alternative path would have been. In fact, the authors suggest that “calibrating” our beliefs in this way could prevent regret from contributing to mood disorders — although further work is clearly needed.</p>

<p><strong>Marijuana commission finds usage high </strong>— <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/marijuana-commission-finds-usage-high"><em>Science News</em></a>, January 29, 1972</p>



<p>Approximately 24 million Americans have used marijuana at least one time. A national survey reports that more than 8 million are still using the drug.… Usage figures are 33 percent higher than the [National Commission on Marijuana and Drug Abuse] had expected, but … after age 25 pot smoking falls off rapidly.</p>



<h4>Update </h4>



<p>Americans’ interest in marijuana has grown over the last 50 years. Since 1972, the number of people age 12 and older in the United States who, in their lifetimes, have inhaled or ingested the drug has increased more than fivefold, to <a href="https://www.samhsa.gov/data/sites/default/files/reports/rpt35323/NSDUHDetailedTabs2020/NSDUHDetailedTabs2020/NSDUHDetTabsSect1pe2020.htm">126.5 million as of 2020</a>, according to the National Survey on Drug Use and Health. The gain in users happened as the <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/legalization-trend-forces-review-marijuanas-dangers">perceived danger of marijuana</a> dropped over time (<em>SN: 6/14/14, p. 16</em>). And unlike in the 1970s, older adults are getting in on the action, though prevalence has risen among adults of all ages. Of the 49.6 million people who reported using pot in 2020, about 47 percent were ages 26 to 49, and about 24 percent were 50 or older.<br></p>

                <p class="has-drop-cap" style="font-size:20px">A 1920s science headline, “Ice cream from crude oil,” may best capture the era’s unbridled enthusiasm for chemistry. “Edible fats, the same as those in vegetable and animal foods … and equally nutritious … <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/ice-cream-crude-oil">can be obtained by breaking up the molecules of mineral oil and rearranging the atoms</a>,” exclaimed <em>Science News Letter</em>, the predecessor to <em>Science News</em>, in 1926. Synthetic ice cream was just one of the wonders that could lie around the corner.</p>



<p>Petroleum would become increasingly valuable, the article continued, “as a source of substances for which man has hither-to been dependent upon the chance bounty of nature.” A rash of potential products included aromatics, flavorings, nitroglycerin for dynamite, plastics, drugs and more.</p>



<p>Petroleum-based ice creams never became the new big thing, yet the last century has witnessed a dramatic leap in humans’ ability to synthesize matter. From our homes and cities to our electronics and clothing, much of what we interact with every day is made possible through the manipulation, recombination and reimagination of the basic substances nature has provided.</p>

<p>“The world is unrecognizable from 100 years ago,” says Anna Ploszajski, a materials scientist and author of the 2021 book <em>Handmade: A Scientist’s Search for Meaning Through Making</em>. And that, she says, is “simply because of the materials that we have around, let alone all of the new ways we use them.”</p>



<p>At the turn of the 20th century, organic chemists learned how to turn coal into a variety of industrial chemicals, including dyes and perfumes. Later, motivated by wartime demand, chemists honed their craft with poison gas, explosives and propellants, as well as disinfectants and antiseptics. As a result, World War I was often called “the chemist’s war.” And at a fundamental level, the new century also ushered in greater understanding of chemical bonds and <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/century/atom-matter-neutron-nuclear-power-fusion">the atom, its constituents and its behavior</a>.</p>



<p>In the decades that followed, approaches in chemistry and physics combined with engineering to give rise to a new field, now called materials science. An extensive survey of the field, put together by the National Academy of Sciences in the 1970s and titled <a href="https://authors.library.caltech.edu/5456/1/hrst.mit.edu/hrs/materials/public/MaterialsAndMansNeeds/index.html">“Materials and Man’s Needs</a>,” described the pace of research: “The transitions from, say, stone to bronze and from bronze to iron were revolutionary in impact, but they were relatively slow in terms of the time scale. The changes in materials innovation and application within the last half century occur in a time span which is revolutionary rather than evolutionary.”</p>



<p>Alongside this new science came new and improved scientific tools. Scientists can now see materials at a much finer scale, with the<a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/magnetic-objective-electron-microscope"> electron microscope</a> making individual atoms visible. <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/x-ray-microscope-invented-nobelist-w-l-bragg">X-ray crystallography</a> unveils atomic arrangements, allowing for a better understanding of materials’ structure. With equipment such as chromatographs and mass spectrometers, today’s scientists can untangle mixtures of chemicals and identify the compounds within. Francis Aston first took advantage of a mass spectrometer in his study of isotopes in 1919, but for a long time the tool was seen by some chemists as, <a href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/pdf/10.1021/ac8013065">according to a description by mass spectrometrist Michael Grayson</a>, “an unexplainable, voodoo, black magic kind of a tool.”</p>



<p>Many new materials were birthed from basic curiosity and serendipity. But new techniques also made way for targeted innovation. Today, materials can be designed from scratch to solve specific problems. And explorations of the properties of solid substances — for instance, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/new-theories-physics-enter-practical-field">how matter interacts with heat, light, electricity or magnetism</a> — along with iterations of design have further contributed to the stuff that surrounds us, giving way to transistors, eyeglass lenses that darken in sunlight, touch screens and hard disk drives. Explorations into how matter interacts with biological tissues have yielded coronary stents, artificial skin and hip replacements that include metal mélanges that are tough and nonreactive when they sit against bone.</p>



<p>The outputs of such efforts are all around us. Take air travel, and the global interconnectivity it introduced. It’s possible thanks to alloys that are lightweight and robust. And today’s personal connectivity — via smartphones and computers — came with transistors made of silicon. Their small size and low power requirements brought computing to our office desks, and then into our homes and pockets. An abundance of plastic housewares and comfy athleisure clothing options are made possible via improvements in polymers.</p>



<p>Yet innovation hasn’t come without consequences. For each tale of progress, there are stories of the marks people have left on this planet. While enabling humans to flourish, many new substances have become pollutants, from PCBs to plastics. However people go about addressing these environmental problems, other new materials will likely be part of the solutions.</p>





<h4>Going places</h4>



<p>It was the summer of 1940, the early days of the Battle of Britain. Nazi Germany’s air force, the Luftwaffe, began a months-long attack on the British Isles that eventually included the nightly bombing raids known as the Blitz. Going into the battle, the Luftwaffe believed it had the upper hand; in battles in France, the Germans had dominated in the air. Little did they know the Allies had a secret weapon — in their fuel tanks.</p>



<p>As Germans began flying over England, they were surprised to find the tables had turned. The British Spitfires and Hurricanes that the Germans had outmaneuvered in France could now climb higher and fly faster thanks to fuel made with a <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/catalytic-cracking-process-considered-very-important">newly developed process called catalytic cracking</a>.</p>



<p>Catalysts boost chemical reactions by reducing the energy needed to get them going. French mechanical engineer Eugene Houdry had developed a catalytic process in the 1930s to make high-octane fuel, which can withstand higher compression and allows engines to deliver more power. Simply increasing the octane rating of aviation fuel from 87 to 100 gave the Allies a crucial edge.</p>

<p>Houdry wasn’t the first to attempt using catalysts to bust the big molecules of heavy fuels into smaller ones to improve performance. But as an avid road racer, he had a special interest in high-quality gasoline. He studied hundreds of catalysts until he landed on aluminum- and silicon-based materials that could do the busting more efficiently than an existing process that relied on heat. When he tested his gasoline in his Bugatti racer, he reached speeds of 90 miles per hour.</p>



<p>In the following decades, catalytic cracking and improvements to the process Houdry pioneered would contribute to the reign of automobiles. Catalytic cracking still produces much of the gas that cars guzzle today.</p>



<p>But all that driving soon took a toll on the environment. When the hydrocarbon molecules in gasoline burn, the engine exhaust contains small amounts of harmful gases: poisonous carbon monoxide, nitrogen oxide that can cause smog and acid rain, as well as unburned hydrocarbons. Los Angeles and other car-packed cities choked on smog in the 1940s and ’50s.</p>



<p>Houdry looked again to catalysts to deal with the pollution that internal combustion engines caused. He designed a catalytic converter.</p>



<p>“When first considered, the problem seems simple,” Houdry wrote in a 1954 patent application. “A great number of catalysts can be used for the reaction. By simply placing one of these catalysts in the exhaust line under controlled conditions, the exhaust fumes can be cleaned.” The catalysts, precious metals such as platinum or palladium, provide docking sites for the harmful gases to hang onto; there, reactions involving oxygen convert them to less harmful forms.</p>

<p>In the 1950s, Houdry outlined a series of reactions, materials and conditions necessary for a working catalytic converter. But he was ahead of his time. For years, the adoption of catalytic converters in automobiles was stymied by leaded gasoline, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/practical-problems-remain">which gummed up the catalysts’ surfaces</a>. Finally, with the passage of the Clean Air Act of 1970, which led to requirements for catalytic converters and lead-free fuel, the air in cities began to clear.</p>



<p>For air travel to serve the masses, a different dilemma needed solving: lightening the load. The earliest airplanes gained lift at the turn of the 20th century on wings of fabric and wood, but to really soar, airplanes needed light but strong materials. The first aircraft designed for passengers — the Ford Trimotor, nicknamed the Tin Goose — took to the air in 1926 with help from aluminum alloys.</p>



<p>Alloys have existed since ancient times. Bronze Age artisans combined copper with arsenic or tin in crucibles to make tools, jewelry and more. From there, advances coincided with the ability to melt metals at higher and higher temperatures, eventually leading to steel. Scientists since have studied how materials’ structures and properties — including desirable features like strength, bendability and resistance to corrosion — vary with composition, temperature and processing.</p>



<p>The fuselage of the Tin Goose contained a newly developed alloy named duralumin, a contraction of “Dürener” (for the company that originally made it) and “aluminum.”</p>



<p>In 1926, <em>Science News Letter</em> described the promise of materials such as <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/scientific-research-make-new-dirigibles-safer">duralumin for safer dirigibles</a>, which would carry large numbers of passengers into the air: “Of these sound materials, strong and light girders must be built. So light that a man can carry one of them in his hand and yet so strong that they will carry loads of thousands of pounds.”</p>



<p>Dirigibles and duralumin were just the beginning. The 20th century saw an explosion in the types of alloys and their applications, from stainless steel cutlery to the titanium alloys used in prostheses and pacemakers to crucial components of vehicles. Today’s jet engines are built of <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/alloys-beyond-superalloys">superalloys</a>, which can withstand infernal temperatures.</p>



<p>Plastics and composites have also helped planes shed weight. Composites combine materials with very different properties — such as glass and plastic — by suspending one in the other or sandwiching them together, for instance. Because they can be tuned to be light and strong, composites have made their way into parts all over planes, from the engine to the wings. Boeing’s 787 Dreamliner, which debuted in 2007, is made up of 50 percent composites by weight.</p>

<h4>Making connections</h4>



<p>For a testament to the power of materials to connect us, just look at an iPhone. “The iPhone contains about 75 elements from the periodic table — a huge proportion of all the atoms that we know about in the universe are in an iPhone,” says Ploszajski, the materials scientist.</p>



<p>Some of those are rare-earth elements, a set of 17 metallic elements mostly on the outskirts of the periodic table. Though they are difficult to mine and process, rare earths are sought after because they lend unusual magnetic, fluorescent and electrical properties to materials made from them. Neodymium, for example, mixed with other metals makes the strongest magnets known. These magnets make your cell phone vibrate and its speakers produce sound.</p>



<p>Despite the hazards associated with mining them, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/sparing-rare-earths">these elements show up in a lot of other 20th century applications too</a>. Rare earths are in color televisions, camera lenses, fiber-optic cables, nuclear reactors, nickel-metal hydride batteries, aircraft engines, PET scanners and much more.</p>

<p>A more familiar element — silicon — is the reason cell phones and laptops are available in such a widespread way.</p>



<p>As a semiconductor, silicon conducts electricity better than ceramics and glass do, but not as well as metals. This in-between status makes it possible to control how electrons zip around a semiconductor, a control that’s ideal for creating electrical switches for circuits in radios, televisions or computers. In the 1930s and ’40s, these and other electronic devices relied on <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/vacuum-tube-has-rival">bulky, breakable glass vacuum tubes</a> to control electric current flow. Decades of semiconductor research pointed to a more reliable, slimmer way.</p>



<p>The first semiconductor switch, dubbed the transistor, was made of germanium and invented at Bell Laboratories in 1947. But teams at Texas Instruments and Bell Labs were both eyeing silicon, which holds up under higher temperatures. Silicon is also less likely than germanium to leak current when a switch is off. Though the two teams independently developed silicon transistors, Texas Instruments’ Gordon Teal gets the credit as his announcement came first, in May 1954.</p>

<p>At a conference in Dayton, Ohio, toward the end of the day’s talks, Teal matter-of-factly revealed his company’s success. “Contrary to what my colleagues have told you about the bleak prospects for silicon transistors,” he said, “I happen to have a few of them here in my pocket.” His announcement, which followed other talks suggesting that the devices were years away, jolted the audience, which stampeded to the back of the room for copies of Teal’s talk, and out to the telephone booth to share the news.</p>



<p>Our attention-sucking phones are right in front of our faces. But out of sight are the fiber optics that relay messages around the world in a flash.</p>



<p>All the glass strung out in the world’s optical cables could tether Earth to Uranus and then some, stretching some 4 billion kilometers. These cables ferry messages across countries and continents and across the seafloor. Optical fiber “really has strung the world together in a new way,” says Ainissa Ramirez, a materials scientist and author of the 2020 book <em><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/favorite-top-science-books-2020">The Alchemy of Us</a> </em>(<em>SN: 4/25/20, p. 28</em>). Messages from across the Atlantic used to come by boat, she says, then came copper cables to relay telegraph dispatches in the 1840s. The first live telephone traffic sent through fiber-optic cables was in 1977 in Long Beach, Calif. Now e-mails from abroad arrive nearly instantaneously thanks to thin-as-hair optical fibers.</p>



<p>The list of materials that helped put oceans of information at our fingertips goes on and on. All of these developments, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/better-batteries-charge-forward">including today’s lithium-ion batteries and more</a>, led to today’s abundance of electronic devices (<em>SN: 1/21/17, p. 22</em>). But ever more improvements, and our constant urge to upgrade, creates a new problem: “How do we unmake this stuff and recycle those substances safely?” Ploszajski asks.</p>

<h4>A plethora of plastic</h4>



<p>In a quest to really grasp the omnipresence of plastics, Susan Freinkel, author of the 2011 book <em>Plastic: A Toxic Love Story</em>, pledged to go a day without touching any. Glimpsing her plastic toilet seat, Freinkel gave up the experiment mere moments after it began. Instead, she spent the day cataloging all the plastic stuff she encountered.</p>



<p>Plastics covered her body — in yoga pants, sneakers and eyeglasses. Plastic made up the entire interior of her minivan and parts of kitchen appliances. Plastic packaging protected her food, and after eating, she dumped her trash in a plastic bin. Even the walls around her contained plastics, from the paint to the synthetic insulation.</p>



<p>Today, we’re awash in plastics. Yet at the beginning of the 20th century, only a handful of plastics had made their way into homes.</p>



<p>The story of commercial plastics began in the 1860s, when John Wesley Hyatt, seeking a substitute for the ivory popularly used in billiard balls, landed on a material later called celluloid. At the heart of celluloid, however, was the natural substance cellulose.</p>



<p>The first fully synthetic plastic, Bakelite, arrived in 1907. It was a fluke discovery by Belgian-born chemist Leo Baekeland, who was seeking an alternative to the natural shellac that insulated electrical cables. Celluloid was a suitable substitute for ivory and tortoiseshell, but sleek, shiny Bakelite gleamed with modernity. It quickly made its way into a host of products, including the casings for radios, jewelry and telephones. A new era of innovating on nature’s materials, rather than merely mimicking them, was born, Freinkel writes.</p>



<p>Yet it wasn’t until the 1920s that researchers started to understand plastics’ chemical nature. Plastics are made of polymers, large molecules made of repeating units. At the time, what gave natural polymers like cellulose, shellac and rubber their properties remained unknown. So inventors seeking new human-made substitutes relied on trial and error to make something similar. Credit for changing all that goes to the German <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/nobelist-pioneered-chemistry-synthetics">organic chemist Hermann Staudinger</a>.</p>



<p>From experiments on natural rubber, Staudinger showed that large, heavy molecules could be formed by linking many smaller molecules into chains. As <em>Science News Letter</em> put it in 1953, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/nobelist-pioneered-chemistry-synthetics">when Staudinger was awarded the Nobel Prize in chemistry</a>: “The way the molecules regiment themselves determines the differences between springy rubber, hard plastic and tough fiber.” It might sound obvious today, but Staudinger’s finding was controversial. Chemists at the time thought that what we now call macromolecules were simply aggregates of smaller molecules.</p>

<p>Staudinger’s ideas gradually gained acceptance and formed a basis for new research on polymers. In the following decade, industrial chemists worked to figure out the chemical reactions needed to create new polymers, plastics among them. One early success story was nylon, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/castor-oil-coal-newest-silkworms-stockings">a carbon-based polymer patented in 1938 as a substitute for silk</a>. American women were introduced to nylon stockings in 1940. Within a year, nylons grabbed 30 percent of the hosiery market.</p>



<p>But it was World War II that drastically increased demand for plastics. The military turned to the new industry to make substitutes for strategic materials such as glass, brass or steel, Freinkel says. Nylon was needed for military uses, so women offered up their stockings to be recycled.</p>



<p>“Great piles of stockings retired after faithful and intimate service are awaiting resurrection — thousands of pounds of them,” <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/nylon-after-war">reported <em>Science News Letter</em> in 1943</a>.</p>



<p>Though small at the start of the war, the plastics industry got better at making its wares and boosted production. Processes such as injection molding, which spurts melted plastic into a mold “sort of like a Play-Doh Fun Factory,” Freinkel says, made it possible to mass-produce plastic. A technique called blow molding, invented in the 1930s and based on the same principle as glass blowing, offered a quick way to form plastic bottles.</p>



<p>As wartime demand dried up, the plastics industry began to bring its products to the people. “You start to get this flood of plastic into everyday life,” Freinkel says.</p>



<p>The promise of plastic was on display in 1946. Held in New York City, the first National Plastics Exhibition featured wares made of the wonder material. “Thousands of people lined up to go to this trade show and walk through this conference hall and gawk at stuff that had an almost magical quality,” Freinkel says. Visitors saw durable nylon fishing line and window screens in a riot of colors. Mass-produced plastic offered “a new way to have the good life on the cheap.”</p>



<p>We’ve come a long way from the days of celluloid and Bakelite. Tens of thousands of plastic compounds exist today. The world now produces in excess of 380 million metric tons of plastic a year — that’s more than a hundred pounds of what’s typically very lightweight stuff for every person on the planet every year.</p>

<h4>Consequences</h4>



<p>By the mid-1960s, researchers started noticing plastic pieces in the ocean, Freinkel says. Today, plastic pollution is found virtually everywhere, in bits <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/tiny-microplastics-travel-far-wind">wafting in the winds</a>, high in <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/plastics-remote-places-microplastics-earth-mount-everest">Mount Everest’s snow</a> and as <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/mirco-plastic-debris-accumulating-far-beneath-ocean-surface">trash piling up on the seafloor</a>.</p>



<p>Plastics are the quintessential example of the journey from material marvel to environmental nuisance. But they’re not the only problem.</p>



<p>The organic chemistry advances of the early 1900s made new and exciting materials possible, but also allowed people to make more and more materials that weren’t recyclable, says Thomas Le Roux, a historian at the French National Center for Scientific Research in Paris and co-author of the 2020 book <em>The Contamination of the Earth</em>. By the 1970s, new disposable products, from pens to razors to packaging, signaled an ease of life. “It was modern to throw away what we buy,” he says.</p>



<p>The consequences of this easy-come, easy-go relationship with our stuff soon appeared in the environment. Our unabated demand for fossil fuels, used not only as fuel but as raw materials for making plastics, releases emissions that contribute to Earth’s changing climate.</p>

<p>Many of our modern substances were created to solve problems, says Mark Jones, a chemist and member of the National Historic Chemical Landmarks committee of the American Chemical Society. For instance, before the 1930s, air conditioning and refrigeration relied on ammonia, which is flammable and toxic. That changed with the introduction of Freon and other chlorofluorocarbons, or CFCs for short, which were created by chemists in the 1920s. These molecules appeared to have little effect on living things. “They were presumed to be incredibly safe,” says Jones, who recently retired from Dow Chemical.</p>



<p>But Freon and its CFC cousins had <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/freon-destroying-ozone-layer">unforeseen consequences on the atmosphere</a> when they escaped air conditioning and refrigeration systems. In the 1980s, scientists discovered a hole in Earth’s ozone layer that forms when CFCs rise to the stratosphere, break down and react with ozone, destroying it. In solving one problem, humankind found itself with another.</p>

<h3>CFCs’ creation&nbsp;</h3>



<p>In 1985, scientists discovered a hole in the ozone layer, created by chlorofluorocarbons in the stratosphere. The Montreal Protocol turned things around: 2019 saw the smallest ozone hole ever recorded (compared below with 1987).</p>

<p>The history of science offers up abundant examples of solutions begetting new problems. Polychlorinated biphenyls, or PCBs, useful insulators in electronics, can cause serious health problems, including cancer, when they enter the environment. The compounds that allow food to slide out of kitchen pans without sticking belong to a family that has earned the title “forever chemicals” for the tendency not to degrade. <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/search-new-geologic-sources-lithium-could-power-clean-future">Lithium mining</a>, which has increased with demand for lithium-ion batteries, guzzles water and can release harmful chemicals that contaminate ecosystems and poison drinking wells. Other battery ingredients, such as cobalt, are mined unethically — sometimes using child labor.</p>



<p>Perhaps the largest unintended consequence that humankind faces today is climate change. Human activities — factories, mining, growing food, traveling, using air conditioning and heating to keep indoor climates comfortable — have released greenhouse gas emissions that have heated the world by around 1.25 degrees Celsius since preindustrial times. The world is already experiencing <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/climate-change-un-ipcc-report-humans">extreme weather events linked to climate change</a>.</p>



<div class="wp-block-sciencenews-content-sidebar alignright">

metric tons</h5><p style="text-align: center">Amount of plastic
produced per year</p>
</div>



<p>Clearly chemists and materials scientists have contributed to these problems. But they will inevitably be part of finding solutions as well. There’s a cyclical nature to the promise and perils of new molecules and materials. “The entire history of chemistry is, ‘Hey, look what I can do! Darn, I wish I hadn’t done it that way! But I have another way I can do it.’ And that keeps us kind of moving forward,” Jones says.</p>



<p>Chemists are now creating plastics that will <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/chemistry-recycling-plastic-landfills-trash-materials">break down after use and can be recycled more easily</a> (<em>SN: 1/30/21, p. 20</em>). Materials scientists are developing <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/engineering-clean-drinking-water-treatment-pollution">better membrane materials to filter pollutants</a> out of water (<em>SN: 11/24/18, p. 18</em>). Engineers are deploying new materials to capture carbon dioxide at smokestacks.</p>



<p>New iron-based catalysts could someday convert captured <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/new-iron-based-catalyst-converts-carbon-dioxide-into-jet-fuel">carbon dioxide into jet fuel</a>, potentially cutting greenhouse gas emissions from air travel (<em>SN: 1/30/21, p. 5</em>). And researchers continue to innovate to turn more and more of the <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/perovskites-power-solar-industry">solar spectrum into energy</a>, and so cut our reliance on fossil fuels (<em>SN: 8/5/17, p. 22</em>).</p>



<p>Chemistry and materials innovation can’t solve all our problems. People’s choices also matter. Weighing the risks and rewards that come with new materials will require recognition of the potential problems, regulations to combat them, willpower, collaboration and collective action. History holds plenty of lessons, but it’s not yet clear whether we’ll learn from them.</p>

Since our foundation in 2001, to date, PLOS has published <strong>297,968 articles</strong> across our journals under this Open Access CC BY model, and we have helped pioneer the sustainability of rigorous Open Access publishing. In addition, we also are <a href="https://plos.org/financial-overview/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">transparent about our finances</a> every year, and we have adopted the<a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2021/09/our-commitment-to-price-transparency/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> pricing transparency model </a>that has been developed by the funders of the <a href="https://www.coalition-s.org/">Plan S</a> project.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Therefore we support this statement that this shift is not just desirable, but entirely proven and sustainable, and able to be executed with the desired levels of transparency.</p>



<p>However, in addition to our support for this Open Access vision we would add several points to the statement to ensure it does not only focus on published Open Access Versions of Record, but also accommodates the developing Open Science ecosystem.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In our opinion, focusing on research article Versions of Record, and spending the following three years only focused on an OA financing system, risks further embedding them as the primary and sole unit of sharing research. In considering how to reorganize the financing system to support more openness and research integrity, we believe it will be important to look beyond OA and build in the potential to support policies and developments that will enable more efficient and transparent research-sharing, especially as that is something the Wissenschaftsrat additionally seeks.</p>



<p>As a publisher aligned with Wissenschaftsrat&rsquo;s vision, PLOS serves a much broader role than simply the provision of publishing services and a host of the Version of Record. The most well-known example is our Open Data policy: since 2014, all PLOS journals have <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/s/data-availability" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">required authors </a>to make all data necessary to replicate their study&rsquo;s findings publicly available without restriction at the time of publication (acknowledging standard exceptions for specific legal or ethical restrictions). And, since July 2014, to date, <strong>177,357 articles</strong> have been published with such Data Availability Statements. And, now, conversations about open data, reproducibility, and research integrity &ndash; a.k.a. Open Science &ndash; are all part of the mainstream conversation around research communication as they have been proven to be sustainable values and behaviors within that system.</p>



<p>Via this open data policy, but also <a href="https://plos.org/published-peer-review-history/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">open peer review options</a>, <a href="https://plos.org/protocols/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">protocols</a>, <a href="https://plos.org/open-science/open-methods/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">open methods</a>, <a href="https://plos.org/open-science/preregistration/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">preregistration</a>, <a href="https://plos.org/open-science/preprints/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">preprint facilitation</a>, and our <a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2021/09/announcing-a-new-plos-policy-on-inclusion-in-global-research/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">recent policy addressing inclusion in global research</a>, PLOS is working towards Open Science at a scale and in ways that increase the transparency and rigor of the entire research communication system, and not just our journals. In addition, we are working tirelessly to develop <a href="https://plos.org/resources/for-institutions/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">business models beyond Article Processing Charges</a> (APCs) so that both Open Access, and Open Science outputs and behaviors, are sustainable, equitable, and workable at a global scale.</p>



<p>In summary, this moment of the COVID-19 pandemic is not just a time to highlight the importance of Open Access, but also Open Science, and Open Science&rsquo;s focus on trust and inclusion in the system of research communication. Our Open Science vision aligns with that of the Wissenschaftsrat and needs the support of forward-thinking organizations like it. We would happily discuss how we can work together and help each other.</p>
