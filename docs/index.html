              <h4><a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2021/07/27/some-teenagers-at-risk-of-self-harming-can-be-identified-a-decade-in-advance/">Some Teenagers At Risk Of Self-Harming Can Be Identified A Decade In Advance</a></h4>

              
                <p><em>By </em><a href="http://emilyoliviareynolds.com/">Emily Reynolds</a></p>



<p>There are multiple risk factors for self-harm, including a history of abuse, trauma, physical and mental illness, and bullying. Identifying these factors is a key part of prevention, ensuring that those at risk receive appropriate support as early as possible — but despite this, predicting who may end up engaging in self-harming behaviour is still tricky.     </p>



<p>But we may be able to identify these risks earlier than we thought, a <a href="https://www.jaacap.org/article/S0890-8567(21)00219-7/fulltext">new study</a> from a University of Cambridge team suggests. Stepheni Uh and colleagues report that some at-risk adolescents could be identified ten years before they self-harm — offering what the team says is an “extended window” during which help and support can be offered.</p>



<span id="more-43031"></span>



<p>Participants were part of an ongoing longitudinal study focusing on the experiences of young people in the UK; data has been gathered since participants were nine months old. At age 14, they had indicated whether they’d engaged in self-harming behaviour, and completed a questionnaire about depressive feelings and behaviours. At various points throughout their childhood, their caregivers had also completed a questionnaire about the child’s mental and physical health, self-esteem, sleep, their home environment, the quality of their friendships and any adverse experiences including bullying.</p>



<p>The team then used a neural network to identify the risk factors for self-harming among their participants. This also examined whether there were any distinct subgroups who had different characteristics or risk factors.</p>



<p>Two profiles emerged. The first set of children had a long-term history of poor mental health, which was apparent as early as five years old, and were more likely to have caregivers who had their own mental health issues. This group was also more likely to have experienced bullying before they began to harm themselves, and faced other problems in their home life.</p>



<p>For this group, then, risk factors for self-harm were evident up to ten years before the first incident. The findings could allow for the development of interventions that target those at risk of self-harm far earlier than is currently the case. Work on child and adolescent mental health strongly suggests that early intervention is key: <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0190740919314513">developing trauma-informed environments</a>, anti-bullying measures, exercises to boost self-esteem, support for those dealing with parental illness, and, crucially, well-funded mental health services, could therefore go some way to prevent further harm.</p>



<p>However, the second, larger, group did not show the same long-term risk factors. Instead this group was characterised by impulsivity and risk-taking behaviours which developed during teenage years. They also tended to feel less secure with friends and family.</p>



<p>Because teens who fit this profile did not show the same risk factors in childhood, they may be harder to identify. But the research still provides potential ways of helping these at-risk young people too, <a href="https://www.cam.ac.uk/research/news/teenagers-at-greatest-risk-of-self-harming-could-be-identified-almost-a-decade-earlier">co-author Duncan Astle says</a>. “Given that they experience difficulties with their peers and are more willing to engage in risky behaviours, then providing access to self-help and problem-solving or conflict regulation programmes may be effective.”</p>



<p>Crucially, the study shows that those who self-harm are not a homogenous group: there are many complex risk factors associated with self-harm that interact with other life experiences, personality and more. Early responses and interventions should therefore be tailored to these individual differences rather than relying on one-size-fits-all solutions.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/anole-lizards-breathe-underwater-air-bubble-snout">How some lizards breathe underwater</a></h4>

              
                <p>Some anole lizards have a newfound superpower: They can breathe underwater by trapping air in a bubble on their snouts. What’s more, these reptiles can stay submerged for nearly 20 minutes by rebreathing exhaled air in the bubble, a new study shows.</p>



<p>“As anyone who has encountered one of these lizards can tell you, they dive underwater when they feel threatened,” says&nbsp;evolutionary biologist Chris Boccia of Queen’s University in Kingston, Canada. But how the lizards stay underwater for so long had been a mystery until now.</p>



<p>Boccia was inspired to investigate by a story one of his professors told him when he was a student at the University of Toronto. In 2009, evolutionary biologist Luke Mahler had been studying an endangered species of <em>Anolis</em> lizard in Haiti. After releasing a lizard back into a clear, shallow stream, Mahler noticed something odd. As the animal clung to the rocky bottom, it exhaled an air bubble on its snout and appeared to repeatedly suck the air in and out of the bubble. Mahler had to move on to his next research site so he couldn’t explore more. But years later, he still remembered the bubble-headed lizard.</p>



<p>Boccia and colleagues traveled to Costa Rica in 2017 in search of bubble-headed anoles, capturing the creatures at night. “Doing this when they’re sleeping makes things less stressful for them,” Boccia says. It’s also “easier for us to catch them.”</p>





<p>Wearing head lamps to find the lizards in the dark, the researchers collected 300 anoles representing a range of species — 120 lizards were found near streams and 180 were found away from streams. Back at their camp, Boccia and colleagues gently dunked each lizard in containers of river water.</p>



<p>While underwater, all of the anoles carried a bubble of air around their snouts and appeared to breathe the bubble in and out. But river-based lizards <a href="https://www.cell.com/current-biology/issue?pii=S0960-9822(20)X0014-5">rebreathed more often and stayed submerged longer</a> than their land-based relatives, Boccia, Mahler and colleagues report in the July 12 <em>Current Biology.</em></p>



<p>“One lizard was underwater for 18 minutes,” Boccia says. “We were starting to get worried about him.”</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" width="680" height="510" src="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/072121_SO_rebreathing_lizard_researchers_inline.jpg" alt="Chris and James Boccia handling a lizard in a stream habitat" class="wp-image-3101845" srcset="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/072121_SO_rebreathing_lizard_researchers_inline.jpg 680w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/072121_SO_rebreathing_lizard_researchers_inline-511x383.jpg 511w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/072121_SO_rebreathing_lizard_researchers_inline-600x450.jpg 600w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/072121_SO_rebreathing_lizard_researchers_inline-248x186.jpg 248w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><figcaption><span class="caption wp-caption-3101845">Researchers Chris Boccia (left) and his brother James prepare to insert an oxygen probe into a lizard’s underwater snout bubble.</span><span class="credit wp-credit-3101845">C. Boccia</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>Anoles’ water-repelling skin might play a role in forming the bubbles. As the reptile dives into the water, a thin layer of air may get trapped against that skin. When the lizard exhales, air exits through the nostrils and expands the trapped air layer. In that way, the lizard might use its lungs to control the bubble’s size.</p>



<p>If a lizard rebreathed the air in those bubbles, then the bubbles’ oxygen levels should drop over time. Inserting a small oxygen sensor into bubbles around submerged lizards’ snouts confirmed that the oxygen levels slowly dropped as the lizards breathed.</p>



<p>To stay submerged for long periods, the anoles may slow down their metabolism, reducing the need for oxygen, Boccia suspects. And as oxygen levels in the bubble drop and CO<sub>2</sub> levels rise, the bubble may rebalance the levels by shedding CO<sub>2</sub> into the water and uptaking dissolved oxygen, he says.</p>



<p>The findings highlight how different animals have evolved to live in water, says evolutionary biologist Jonathan Losos of Washington University in St. Louis who wasn’t involved in the research. “Species that experience the same challenge in nature often find different ways to overcome it,” Losos says. “Fish use gills to extract oxygen from the water. Whales are able to hold their breath for a long time. And now we know that these lizards take oxygen underwater with them.”</p>



<p>Both Boccia and Mahler hope to continue studying this newfound behavior. “There are so many different types of lizards, there is a good chance that others do it too,” Boccia says. “We just haven’t seen it.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coronavirus-covid-19-why-early-treatment-drugs">Why it’s still so hard to find treatments for early COVID-19</a></h4>

              
                <p>More than a year and a half into the pandemic, researchers are beginning to get a handle on how the coronavirus makes people sick and what to do about it. That includes some valuable lessons about what doesn’t work. Now the trick is to find drugs or therapies that <em>do </em>work, especially for people who aren’t sick enough to go to the hospital. Early treatment may limit transmission of the virus and keep people out of overburdened hospitals.</p>



<p>Finding those treatments is proving to be particularly tricky. While the race to create vaccines was astonishingly successful, effective treatments have proved elusive. But they are crucial, especially because the pandemic is far from over. After seemingly gaining ground on the virus in the United States, cases and hospitalizations are again on the rise as the more infectious <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coronavirus-covid-delta-variant-transmission-vaccines">delta variant</a> sweeps across the country (<em>SN: 7/2/21</em>). The variant is driving a surge of new infections globally, too.</p>



<p>“We still have a lot of people who remain unvaccinated” and at risk of getting COVID-19, says Susanna Naggie, an infectious diseases physician at Duke University School of Medicine. “The need for a safe therapy that can be administered at home remains huge.”</p>



<p>A few drugs — including the antiviral medication <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/covid-19-coronavirus-remdesivir-first-drug-recovery-treatment">remdesivir</a>, immune system–calming antibody therapies such as <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/covid-19-coronavirus-immune-system-chemicals-deadly-cytokine-storm">baricitinib</a> and <a href="https://www.recoverytrial.net/news/tocilizumab-reduces-deaths-in-patients-hospitalised-with-covid-19">tocilizumab</a> and steroids such as <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coronavirus-steroids-reduce-deaths-covid19-patients-who">dexamethasone</a> — have been literal lifesavers for some of the sickest patients (<em>SN: 4/29/20; SN: 10/30/20; SN: 9/2/20</em>). For instance, real-world data from more than 98,000 people hospitalized with COVID-19 suggest that infusions of remdesivir <a href="https://www.abstractsonline.com/pp8/#!/9286/presentation/11269">cut the chance of dying</a> by <a href="https://www.abstractsonline.com/pp8/#!/9286/presentation/10403">up to 23 percent</a>, researchers from the drug’s maker Gilead Sciences, Inc., reported at the World Microbe Forum, held online in June. Still, those drugs don’t save everyone, and they are reserved for people who are hospitalized.</p>

<p>Some <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/covid-19-coronavirus-antibodies-lab-treatment-immune-system">lab-made antibodies</a> may help newly diagnosed people avoid hospitalization and severe illness (<em>SN: 9/22/20</em>). But relatively few people have gotten the treatment, which requires intravenous infusions.</p>



<p>While finding effective, easy-to-take treatments has been no easy task, it’s not for lack of trying. But it can seem like for every encouraging lead, there’s a hurdle. Here’s a look at some of the challenges that have stymied efforts to develop treatments for COVID-19 and some of the promising approaches, including some in pill form, that may still pan out.</p>



<h4>A false lead</h4>



<p>To speed the search for treatments, researchers first reached for drugs already approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and in the medicine cabinet for treating other diseases. Most of the proven treatments for COVID-19 started this way, with the exception of remdesivir. That antiviral drug was developed to fight RNA viruses, but hadn’t been approved prior to the pandemic. It is now the only FDA-approved treatment for COVID-19.</p>



<p>Most repurposed drugs haven’t panned out as coronavirus treatments despite some tantalizing hints they might. Now, scientists have insight into one reason why drugs such as <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/covid-19-coronavirus-hydroxychloroquine-no-evidence-treatment">hydroxychloroquine</a>, chloroquine and about 30 others don’t work in people even though they stop SARS-CoV-2 from infecting cells in lab dishes (<em>SN</em>: 8/2/2020). It’s all connected to a particular side effect of the drugs.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" width="680" height="383" src="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/072621_TI_covid-treat_inline-1_remdesivir.jpg" alt="Curtis Jones lies in a hospital bed and receives a dose os remdesivir" class="wp-image-3101862" srcset="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/072621_TI_covid-treat_inline-1_remdesivir.jpg 680w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/072621_TI_covid-treat_inline-1_remdesivir-330x186.jpg 330w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><figcaption><span class="caption wp-caption-3101862">Remdesivir was the first drug approved by the U.S. FDA for treating COVID-19.

<p>The route to this discovery began in 2020 when researchers identified proteins called sigma receptors in human and monkey cells that interact with some of the virus’s proteins. Researchers thought that might be important for infection. So they proposed that some common <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/covid-19-coronavirus-cough-syrup-medicine-ingredient-virus-worse">antidepressants, antipsychotics and antihistamines may disrupt those interactions</a> and might stymie the coronavirus’s ability to infect people (<em>SN: 4/30/20</em>). &nbsp;</p>



<p>But further investigation showed that for many of the compounds, there was no relationship between a drug’s ability to grab the sigma receptors and effectiveness against the virus when tested on cells grown in lab dishes, says medicinal chemist Brian Shoichet. The drugs either targeted the sigma receptors or they stopped the virus from growing. They didn’t do both.</p>



<p>“When you see something like that, it’s a real showstopper for someone like myself,” says Shoichet, of the University of California San Francisco School of Pharmacy. “It really makes you think, ‘Oh, we’re digging in the wrong place. There’s something fundamentally wrong with our hypothesis,’” he says. The evidence seems to indicate that targeting sigma receptors won’t improve COVID-19 symptoms, he says.</p>



<p>But of the drugs that did have potent antiviral effects, many were ones known to disrupt the way human cells build and use fats called lipids, he noticed. That disruption can lead to a potentially serious side effect called phospholipidosis. That side effect causes lipids to build up in cells, giving some cells a foamy appearance. That buildup can lead to inflammation, which can damage organs or interfere with their functions.</p>



<p>Shoichet and his colleagues wondered if that lipid disruption was causing the antiviral effect. Teaming with researchers from the Novartis Institutes for BioMedical Research in Basel, Switzerland, they first tested whether the drugs were causing the side effect in cells. Sure enough, the <a href="https://science.sciencemag.org/content/early/2021/06/22/science.abi4708">more phospholipidosis the drugs caused, the more potently they inhibited virus growth</a> in those cells, the researchers reported June 22 in <em>Science</em>.</p>



<p>That’s because SARS-CoV-2 needs to build lipid bubbles inside cells where it can replicate. Phospholipidosis may interfere with that process, Shoichet says. That might be a useful property, except for one thing: The drugs that caused the side effect didn’t work in animal experiments. In mice, these drugs didn’t stop the coronavirus from replicating in lung cells, colleagues at the Pasteur Institute in Paris discovered.</p>



<p>This disconnect between a drug’s antiviral activity in lab dishes and its inability to protect animals may happen for two reasons, says François Pognan, an investigative toxicologist at Novartis. Either the drugs have to be given in very high doses to cause phospholipidosis — much higher than would be safe — or they need to build up over time. In lab dishes, “it’s a piece of cake,” Pognan says. But in the body, it’s very difficult to reach levels of the drug that would cause enough lipid disruption to be protective.</p>



<p>That finding could help researchers avoid dead-ends. If a drug stops the coronavirus from growing in cells in the lab, researchers should test for phospholipidosis. If the drug causes that side effect, it should be discarded as a COVID-19 therapy.</p>

<p>Following that advice could impact many ongoing clinical trials and save time and money. Currently, at least 33 drugs, including the antibiotic azithromycin, that cause phospholipidosis are being tested in 136 clinical trials.</p>



<p>One trial at the University of California, San Francisco tested whether azithromycin could clear up symptoms of COVID-19 in 263 newly diagnosed people. There was <a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2782166">no difference between the drug and a placebo</a>, researchers reported July 16 in <em>JAMA</em>. What’s more, people taking the antibiotic were much more likely than those getting a placebo to report side effects, such as abdominal pain, diarrhea and nausea. And five people taking azithromycin were hospitalized, while no one in the placebo group was. An independent monitoring committee recommended ending the trial for “futility.”</p>



<p>Another 180 trials were devoted to hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine, which also lead to the lipid foaming side effect. (Hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine have other issues, too: Both <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/covid-19-coronavirus-hydroxychloroquine-no-evidence-treatment">fail to block the coronavirus’s preferred route of entry</a> and don’t help patients, researchers discovered last year (<em>SN: 8/2/20</em>).)</p>



<p>Together, those 316 trials cost an estimated $6 billion. That money, time and effort would be better spent on drug candidates that don’t cause the side effect, Shoichet, Pognan and colleagues say.</p>



<h4>Helping too few</h4>



<p>Even drugs that work as they are supposed to might not be worth giving to everyone who gets COVID-19. Take interferons. These <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/covid-19-coronavirus-immune-system-early-treatment-interferon">immune system chemicals</a> are among the first to do battle with viruses (<em>SN: 8/6/20</em>). Before the pandemic, researchers at the drug company Synairgen, a spinoff company from the University of Southampton in England, developed an inhaled form of interferon beta and were testing it in people with other respiratory problems, including MERS coronavirus infections. The company quickly began clinical trials to see if interferon beta could help COVID-19 patients, too.</p>



<p>In a trial in 101 hospitalized patients and 120 people who were ill but still at home, participants were randomly assigned to get either inhaled interferon or a placebo. Only two people in the home-care group needed hospitalization, the company said in <a href="https://www.synairgen.com/covid-19/">a preliminary report</a>. Both were in the placebo group. That’s a low percentage of people — about 3 percent — much lower than researchers expected, says Richard Marsden, Synairgen’s CEO. That’s too few to figure out how to target the drug to those who might benefit the most.</p>

<p>The vast majority of people, even people who have health conditions that put them at high risk of complications, don’t get sick enough to need hospitalization. “They have very mild symptoms,” Marsden says. “They need little more than [acetaminophen], a hot water bottle and some sympathy, and they recover very well.”</p>



<p>About 10 percent of people will develop concerning breathlessness and some may end up in the hospital. But it’s so relatively few that you would need to treat a huge number of people just to stop one or two from landing in the hospital, Marsden says. “That’s the quirk of this virus,” he says.</p>



<p>For viruses such as the original SARS or the MERS coronaviruses, which have much higher mortality rates, it makes sense to treat everyone who gets sick right away. But with SARS-CoV-2, the severe breathlessness that sends people to the hospital usually doesn’t show up until the second week of infection. That may be how long it takes for the virus to <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coronavirus-cell-cilia-invade-lungs-covid-pandemic">move down into the lungs</a> and start causing damage there that interferon beta may be able to counter, Marsden hypothesizes (<em>SN</em>: 7/22/2021). So treating people at home earlier might not help anyway.</p>



<p>Results of a Phase III trial for efficacy of interferon beta for hospitalized patients are expected later this year. In the earlier trial, hospitalized people who got the drug were more than twice as likely as those that got a placebo to recover fully to a point where they had no restrictions on their activities, the company reported.</p>



<p>“It’s not worth giving our drug to everybody. Wait until they develop lower respiratory tract illness and then give it to them,” when it may do more good, Marsden says. “It’s a huge ask of a drug that it be so safe and so efficacious that you can give it to everybody.”</p>





<h4>Trial troubles</h4>



<p>Keeping people out of the hospital in the first place would help relieve the burden on health systems and perhaps prevent people from developing long-term consequences from severe illness. But it’s no surprise that early in the pandemic researchers weren’t focused on at-home treatments. &nbsp;</p>



<p>“A lot of the scientific community was just trying to save lives, particularly for patients who were in the hospital,” says Esther Krofah, executive director of FasterCures, part of the Milken Institute think tank based in Washington, D.C. “But there was not a full concerted effort on repurposed drugs that could be helpful for mild to moderate cases.”</p>



<p>One reason for that is that hospitalized patients are easier to recruit into studies, says Naggie of the Duke Clinical Research Institute. “You don’t have to convince them to come in and communicate with the team.”</p>



<p>Outpatient studies often have to advertise, set up hotlines, send letters or call people on the phone to find volunteers willing to take part in the trial. And that can set up situations in which multiple trials are competing for participants. As a result, many trials conducted over the past year didn’t enroll enough people to get definitive answers about whether their treatments worked.</p>



<p>“We need to create a much more cohesive clinical trial system in this country,” Krofah says.</p>



<p>That’s beginning to happen. The National Institutes of Health have <a href="https://www.nih.gov/news-events/news-releases/large-clinical-trial-study-repurposed-drugs-treat-covid-19-symptoms">launched a large trial called ACTIV-6</a>, expected to enroll 13,500 people. It is similar to earlier trials of hospitalized patients that determined that remdesivir, steroids and other treatments can reduce death rates or shave days off hospital stays.</p>



<p>ACTIV-6 will test a battery of existing drugs against a placebo to see if any of them can reduce the chance of people needing hospitalization. The goal is to have five or six, and potentially up to eight “arms” of the trial with all of the drugs being tested at the same time, each in about 600 people, says Naggie, who is one of the study’s principal investigators. People getting the placebo will serve as the comparison group for all of the drugs. First up is the antiparasitic drug ivermectin.</p>



<p>Ivermectin has been used globally for a long time in various forms for treating intestinal parasitic worms, head lice and skin conditions such as rosacea. It’s given to animals to prevent heartworm disease and to treat infections with other parasites. Generally, it is a safe drug, Naggie says.</p>



<p>And there are hints it could work against SARS-CoV-2. The drug had already been shown to limit infections caused by HIV and other RNA viruses, including West Nile, dengue and influenza viruses in lab studies. Researchers in Australia tested ivermectin against SARS-CoV-2 in green monkey cells growing in lab dishes and found that the drug could quickly <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0166354220302011#bib9">shut down production of viral RNA</a>, the group reported last year in <em>Antiviral Research</em>.</p>



<p>Clinical trials have pitted ivermectin against COVID-19. But the studies measured success by different standards, with some tracking viral loads or symptom severity, and others tracking time to recovery or death. Some were randomized and placebo-controlled; others didn’t have control groups. Some trials were done in hospitalized people, others in outpatient settings. Some mixed ivermectin with other drugs.</p>



<p>The results varied. Some showed a benefit of the drug; others showed no difference between ivermectin and a placebo or standard care. Those trials did have one thing in common, says Naggie. “None of them are yet definitive. The quality is not as high as we would like it to be.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>To date, health officials have <a href="https://www.fda.gov/consumers/consumer-updates/why-you-should-not-use-ivermectin-treat-or-prevent-covid-19">recommended against taking ivermectin for COVID-19</a> outside of clinical trials. Even the pharmaceutical company Merck, which makes ivermectin, has said there is <a href="https://www.merck.com/news/merck-statement-on-ivermectin-use-during-the-covid-19-pandemic/">no evidence to support</a> the drug as a COVID-19 treatment.</p>



<p>“What that means is please don’t go take your dog’s ivermectin or your horse’s ivermectin. It has not been proven to be an effective remedy for COVID-19,” Naggie says.</p>



<p>Her study will test ivermectin’s effect in people 30 and older who have been sick for 10 days or less. And people don’t have to leave their homes to participate. Study participants will be mailed the pills and will be asked to fill out daily surveys about their symptoms. Perhaps the trial will show once and for all whether ivermectin works as well in people as it does in lab dishes.</p>

Some lab studies have suggested the pills could help, but clinical trials have been inconclusive.</span><span class="credit wp-credit-3101864">Callista Images/Getty Images Plus</span></figcaption></figure>



<h4>A quick-fix pill?</h4>



<p>Meanwhile, other treatment trials are already well under way, some of which may announce results before the end of this year. Of particular interest are orally administered drugs, some of which are “looming on the horizon quite quickly,” says Yasmeen Long, director of FasterCures.</p>



<p>Among the most promising is an antiviral drug called molnupiravir (formerly <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coronavirus-covid-19-new-early-treatments">EIDD-2801</a>), The drug mimics a building block of RNA and interferes with the virus’s replication, much like remdesivir does (<em>SN</em>: 8/24/2020). Unlike remdesivir, the new drug is in pill form and can be easily be given to newly diagnosed people.</p>



<p>Merck and Miami-based Ridgeback Biotherapeutics are testing the antiviral in a Phase III trial, which will measure the drug’s efficacy in non-hospitalized people who have at least one risk factor for serious complications from COVID-19. Already the U.S. government has <a href="https://www.merck.com/news/merck-announces-supply-agreement-with-u-s-government-for-molnupiravir-an-investigational-oral-antiviral-candidate-for-treatment-of-mild-to-moderate-covid-19/">agreed to buy 1.7 million courses</a> of the drug, if the FDA grants it emergency use authorization, Merck announced in a news release.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Early results of a Phase II trial of safety, dosing and efficacy found that people who took 800 milligrams of molnupiravir twice daily for five days had <a href="https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.06.17.21258639v1">less virus in their noses</a> than people who got a placebo, researchers reported June 17 at medRxiv.org. Within three days of starting treatment, only 1.9 percent of the 202 people taking 800 mg of molnupiravir had detectable virus in nasal swabs. That compares with 16.7 percent of those taking the placebo.</p>



<p>By day five of treatment, researchers detected no virus in people taking molnupiravir, while 11.1 percent of people on the placebo still had detectable virus in their swabs. If those preliminary results, which have not been reviewed by other scientists yet, hold up, it may mean that the drug could shorten the course of illness, keep people out of the hospital and reduce the chance of spreading the virus to others.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Other studies, including one testing the <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/covid-19-coronavirus-antidepressant-fluvoxamine-treatment">antidepressant pill fluvoxamine</a> (<em>SN: 2/1/21</em>) and a large study of other repurposed drugs may also yield easy, early and effective treatments. “Which is great,” Naggie says, because “whether or not one trial is going to change all of clinical practice is questionable.” Having multiple studies of people who are sick at home might “help move the needle on what might be useful,” she says.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://xcorr.net/2021/07/26/dimensionality-reduction-in-neural-data-analysis/">Dimensionality reduction in neural data analysis</a></h4>

              
                <div class="wp-block-jetpack-markdown"><p>It&#8217;s become commonplace to record from hundreds of neurons simultaneously. <a href="https://xcorr.net/2021/04/27/accelerating-progress-in-brain-recording-tech/">If past trends extrapolate</a>, we might commonly record 10k neurons by 2030. What are we going to do with all this data?</p>
<blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p>Neural dynamics tend to be lower-dimensional than the number of neurons recorded would suggest &#8211; <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2011.08088">Humphries (2020)</a> reports 10X to 100X compression depending on the area and task. Humphries suggests, with the strong principle of neural dimensionality reduction, that dimensionality reduction can show us the <em>true</em> underlying signal embodied by the neural circuit. Even if we don&#8217;t fully believe in this strong principle &#8211; it&#8217;s certainly contentious among vision researchers &#8211; many subscribe to the weak principle: the smaller, temporally smoother, and less noisy subspace can be easier to understand than the raw data.</p>

<p><em>Rotational dynamics in latent space during arm reach, from <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22722855/">Churchland et al. (2012)</a></em></p>
<p>Here, I present taxonomies of unsupervised methods in neural data analysis, identify some exciting trends in the literature, and show some key gaps &#8211; a research roadmap for the next few years.</p>
<h2>Goals</h2>
<p>Why do we care about dimensionality reduction in neuroscience? Let&#8217;s count the ways (roughly sorted by ambition, or from weak principle to strong principle):</p>
<ul>
<li>Compression: there are practical computational reasons to compress the data down to a few dozens of dimension rather than a few hundreds &#8211; i.e. to save memory and processing.</li>
<li>Visualization: humans are not good at visualizing more than 2 or 3 dimensions. Compressing information down to a handful of meaningful dimensions makes it more feasible to plot them, and understand the factors of variations in the data visually.</li>
<li>Denoising: if we want to understand what happens during single trials, we need to denoise the data. If 100 neurons are 100 independent manifestations of the same latent variable, we can boost the signal-to-noise ratio by a factor √100 = 10 by averaging. Dimensionality reduction flexibly averages multiple overlapping realizations of the same data to achieve a boost in signal-to-noise ratio.</li>
<li>Generate fake data: many dimensionality reduction methods are valid generative models, and we can use them generate fake neural data, for instance to benchmark spike sorting and calcium imaging signal processing pipelines.</li>
<li>Relating to behaviour: the noisy, high-dimensional neural data is hard to relate to the behaviour of the animal, which is often what we care about in the end. Compressing the info into to a lower-dimensional subspace can make it easier to relate to the behaviour.</li>
<li>Understanding computation: the latent space may represent interesting aspects of the neural computation invisible in the raw data, for example, line attractor or rotational dynamics. The dimensionality-reduced latent space can help uncover those hidden computations.</li>
<li>Untangling latent factors: perhaps most ambitiously, we want to identify latent factors which <em>cause</em> the variation in the data. Most dimensionality reduction methods don&#8217;t directly capture causal mechanisms &#8211; meaning that each logical dimension may capture several causal mechanisms. But some dimensionality reduction methods <em>aspire</em> to untangle independent causes &#8211; with linear ICA (independent component analysis) perhaps being the most well known example. Standard disclaimer: causal inference is hard. Be skeptical of causal claims. This is an active area of research.</li>
</ul>
<h2>The models</h2>
<p>Given these diverse analysis objectives, we can compile a canonical model which covers a wide range of dimensionality reduction techniques.</p>
<p><img src="https://xcorr.files.wordpress.com/2021/07/sketch-conventional.png?w=700" alt="sketch-conventional.png"></p>
<p><em>Figure uses assets from <a href="https://elephant.readthedocs.io/en/latest/">Elephant</a> documentation, released under BSD-3</em></p>
<p>Conceptually, we have a generative model which maps latent factors <em>z(t)</em> to neural observations <em>x(t)</em> via a mapping function <em>f</em> and a noise model. The latent factors evolve according to their dynamics <em>D</em>. A central goal of the dimensionality reduction technique is learn an inference function <em>φ</em> which maps neural observations <em>x(t)</em> to latent factors <em>z(t)</em>. This inference function could be as simple as matrix multiplication or as complex as an implicit function implemented by a multi-step optimization procedure.</p>
<p>To place some stakes in the ground, let&#8217;s see how these different components interact in some popular models that you might have heard of:</p>
<ul>
<li>PCA: In Principal Component Analysis (PCA), the mapping function <em>f</em> is an instantaneous linear function and the noise is Gaussian (in the probabilistic extension of PCA). The dynamics are not explicitly modeled. The inference function is the matrix inverse of the mapping function</li>
<li>ICA: In Independent Component Analysis (ICA), the class of mapping functions is the same as in PCA, but during learning, the mapping function <em>φ</em> is constrained that the latent space <em>z(t)</em> is factorized into independent sources.</li>
<li>GPFA: In Gaussian Process Factor Analysis (GPFA), the mapping function is again a linear function followed by Gaussian noise, but now the dynamics are explicitly modeled using a independent Gaussian Process (GP) prior. You can think of this as imposing that the latent variables vary smoothly over time. The inference is done through closed form GP inference with Expectation Maximization to learn the hyperparameters</li>
<li>LFADS: In Latent Factor Analysis via Dynamical Systems (LFADS), the dynamics are given by an RNN, while the mapping function is linear and the noise can be Gaussian or Poisson. The RNN implicity imposes smooth dynamics. Inference is done via variational inference in a variational autoencoder (VAE) framework.</li>
</ul>
<p>Perhaps the most important moving piece is the dynamics. To infer the latent structure of neural activity at a single trial level, with currently existing recording technology, there just isn&#8217;t enough neurons and SNR to infer latents at a single-trial level: we have to flexibly smooth through time. Complex dynamics priors require sophisticated, probabilistic methods for inference &#8211; each with their tradeoffs in terms of speed, simplicity of implementation, and generality &#8211; which is why we&#8217;ve seen an explosion of methods in the last 5 years.</p>
<h2>Taxonomies</h2>
<p>Now that we&#8217;ve seen some examples of dimensionality reduction methods in the wild, let&#8217;s look at some published taxonomies that try to bring some order into the chaos. I&#8217;ve annotated these taxonomies with the components of the canonical model (in red) above for reference. An early taxonomy is in the now classic review <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nn.3776">Cunningham and Yu (2014)</a>:</p>
<p><img src="https://xcorr.files.wordpress.com/2021/07/cunningham-2014-annotated-1.png?w=700" alt="cunningham-2014.png"></p>
<p>We see the diversity of goals represented in this early work. Much of the research in the following years has been focused on building sophisticated new methods of inference that assume explicit generative and dynamics models. Dynamics allow models to integrate information over time, which makes it possible to do single-trial inference. John Cunningham presented a new taxonomy of these models in a talk circa 2018:</p>
<p><img src="https://xcorr.files.wordpress.com/2021/07/cunningham-taxonomy-annotated.png?w=700" alt="cunningham-taxonomy.png"></p>
<p><em>Apologies for the low quality, it was extracted from a photo of the key slide</em></p>
<p>This updated table is a bit hard to parse, but I find it gives a lot of historical context and genealogy: we see early work on tractable models in the left column (hidden Markov models, linear dynamical systems, switching LDS) evolved into more sophisticated models in the middle and right columns.</p>
<p>With sophisticated models comes sophisticated inference techniques; <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AAfslStLYBo">Memming Park provided an excellent summary in a 2020 CoSyNe talk</a>:</p>
<p><img src="https://xcorr.files.wordpress.com/2021/07/memming-taxonomy-annotated.png?w=700" alt="memming-taxonomy.png"></p>
<p>Many of these methods were compiled very recently into yet another taxonomy from <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2102.01807">Hurwitz el al. (2021)</a>, synthesizing some of the earlier work in this space with cutting-edge methods.</p>
<p><img src="https://xcorr.files.wordpress.com/2021/07/unsupervised-2021-annotated.png?w=700" alt="unsupervised-2021.png"></p>
<p>The acronyms are a bit non-descript, but you can often guess what each method is about by looking at groups of letters within the acronyms:</p>
<ul>
<li>GP: Gaussian Process. Gaussian processes are often used to impose temporal smoothness on latent variables, and more rarely to model nonlinear tuning curves.</li>
<li>LDS: Linear dynamical system. The Kalman filter is an example of a model with an underlying linear dynamical system.</li>
<li>SLDS: Switching LDS. A model which can switch between 2 or more latent linear dynamics depending on a discrete variable.</li>
<li>P*: Poisson. A starting P in an acronym often refers to a Poisson noise model.</li>
<li>VAE: Variational auto-encoder. A latent variable model which compresses observations to latents using an encoder down to a tractable distribution (frequently a multivariate Gaussian) and which is fit through variational inference.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Modelling behaviour</h2>
<p>You&#8217;ll notice that these taxonomies don&#8217;t explicitly address how behaviour and experimental conditions are integrated into each model. Some of the most interesting developments in this field relate to explicitly integrating behaviour into dimensionality reduction.</p>
<p><img src="https://xcorr.files.wordpress.com/2021/07/sketch-integrated.png?w=700" alt="sketch-integrated.png"></p>
<p>Let&#8217;s consider a more general version of the dimensionality reduction model, which integrates behaviour, as well as external covariates corresponding to experimental conditions. Here, we have behaviour time series <em>u(t)</em> which are parallel to neural time series <em>x(t)</em>. <em>u(t)</em> could consist of time series of arm position in a reaching task, PCs of a video of a mouse&#8217;s face, or experimental conditions, for example. The mapping functions and generative models now operate on the concatenation of these times series &#8211; the latent space <em>z(t)</em> is shared between behaviour and neural data. Here, the distinction between regression of behaviour onto brain data (or vice versa) and dimensionality reduction is blurred: it&#8217;s something in the middle. This is the mental model I&#8217;m using when considering the integration of behaviour and neural data, but be aware that there are a lot of different ways of integrating behaviour and neural data that look superficially different.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s my own little taxonomy of behaviourally-aware models:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/lda_qda.html#lda-qda">LDA</a>: Linear discriminant analysis. Classic technique. Finds a set of dimensions which can maximally discriminate a set of classes. No dynamics.</li>
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canonical_correlation">CCA</a>: Canonical correlation analysis. Classic technique. Finds a common linear subspace between two different sets of matrices. Inference and mapping both down through linear functions. No dynamics</li>

<h2>Exciting trends</h2>
<h3>Behaviour</h3>
<p>As you might have infered from the previous paragraph, I&#8217;m excited to see the progress in models which explicitly integrate behaviour. Dimensionality reduction algorithms are often sanity-checked on known low-dimensional systems &#8211; e.g. the Van der Pol oscillator, the Lorenz system, balanced E-I networks. When they&#8217;re deployed in the wild, however, evaluating them often boils down to matching them to known behaviour and experimental conditions. In essence, the behaviour <em>is</em> the ground truth. In this context, it is a missed opportunity to not explicitly model behaviour.</p>
<p>You may be asking yourself: how does a latent variable model which integrates behaviour and neural data any different than simply regressing behaviour against neural data? One answer is that there&#8217;s a shared low-dimensional bottleneck, and the structure of that low-dimensional bottleneck can reveal something interesting about neural computations and behaviours. Consider for instance <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26687221/">Wiltschko et al. (2015)</a>, who modeled the spontaneous behaviour of mice with an autoregressive hidden Markov model (AR-HMM): the mouse is assumed to follow different linear dynamics determined by a discrete state (e.g. walk, pause, low rear, etc.). This is an example of a <a href="https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~hinton/absps/switch.html">switching linear dynamical system (SLDS)</a>, which has also been frequently applied to neural data.</p>
<p><img src="https://xcorr.files.wordpress.com/2021/07/wiltschko.png?w=700" alt="wiltschko.png"></p>
<p>Now imagine the same model, but this time applied to both neural and behavioural data. The inferred states would not only reveal behavioural states which are visible through an overhead camera, but also neural states like arousal and attention. In fact, the goal of PSID is to partition the low-dimensional bottleneck into behaviour-only, neural-only, and behaviour-and-neural dimensions. An ideal model would add a few more layers of indirection (e.g. discrete states, different nonlinear <em>plants</em> for the behavioural and neural components, switching dynamics) to the basic plan formulated in PSID. Think of it as interpretable nonlinear CCA (canonical correlation analysis) with dynamics.</p>
<p>What can we hope to get out of such models? One of the most surprising findings in mouse vision in the past few years is the discovery of numerous coding dimensions for facial behaviour in visual cortex (<a href="https://science.sciencemag.org/content/364/6437/eaav7893.full?ijkey=PHaXxFoO8kMGw&amp;keytype=ref&amp;siteid=sci">Stringer et al. (2019)</a>). At the heart of this finding is a reduced rank regression which finds a large amount of shared variance between face behaviour and visual responses (rank 16!). This is the kind of research that redefines our understanding of the relationship between neural activity and behaviour, and I expect we&#8217;ll see a lot of this as tools mature.</p>
<p><img src="https://xcorr.files.wordpress.com/2021/07/reduced-rank-regression.png?w=500" alt="reduced-rank-regression.png"></p>
<h3>Rich decoding models</h3>
<p>When I was first looking into dimensionality reduction techniques, it struck me that most techniques sensibly used simple, linear functions <em>f</em> to map from latent variables <em>z(t)</em> to <em>x(t)</em>. I was confused by some methods&#8217; use of powerful, nonlinear decoding functions <em>f</em>. If the goal is to find a latent subspace which is easy to interpret, wouldn&#8217;t it be better to have a simple mapping from latents to data &#8211; something similar to the trusted LNP (linear-nonlinear-Poisson) model?</p>
<p>The <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31244512/">P-GPLVM paper</a> (Anqi Wu et al. 2017) convinced me otherwise. To decode an animal&#8217;s position on a linear track from the hippocampus with a linear decoding function, you would need a high-dimensional latent space. If your track is one meter long, and each place field is about 20 cm wide, then you&#8217;d need perhaps 5 dimensions (=100 cm / 20 cm) to represent all the place fields. But there&#8217;s only one logical dimension (the linear position on the track)! Adding nonlinearities in the decoding (in the style of generalized additive models) fixes this deficiency.</p>
<p><img src="https://xcorr.files.wordpress.com/2021/07/pgplvm.png?w=700" alt="pgplvm.png"></p>
<p>We&#8217;re also seeing efforts to fuse signal processing pipelines and dimensionality reduction. Batty et al. (2019) present a hierarchical model (<a href="https://papers.nips.cc/paper/2019/hash/a10463df69e52e78372b724471434ec9-Abstract.html">BehaveNet</a>) to infer latents directly from images of a mouse. Relatedly, <a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.03.05.434105v1.abstract">VaLPACa</a> (variational ladders for parallel auto-encoding of calcium imaging data) applies a hierarchical variant of LFADS to directly extract latent variables from calcium images. Fusing the signal processing component with the latent variable model often means using a rich nonlinear decoding model.</p>
<p><img src="https://xcorr.files.wordpress.com/2021/07/behave-net.png?w=700" alt="behave-net.png"></p>
<p>Thus, we&#8217;re likely to see more papers with rich decoding models, whether they be GP, RNNs, or invertible neural networks.</p>
<h3>Mining the progress in machine learning</h3>
<p>This article started a few months ago when I wanted to have the tools to understand Memming&#8217;s taxonomy and the methods highlighted &#8211; so I took a course on <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/berkeley-cs294-158-sp20/home">deep unsupervised learning</a> to have the right background. It turns out that modern unsupervised learning has influenced dimensionality reduction in neuroscience in several visible ways: using RNNs to represent complex dynamics, and inference using BBVI and VAE techniques. However, there are a lot of other advances in unsupervised learning (see curriculum for the deep unsupervised learning course) which have not yet made a big dent in dimensionality reduction in neuroscience .</p>
<p>Self-supervised learning can learn good, low-dimensional representations without explicitly learning a generative model, for instance using contrastive techniques. <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.04871v1">In this paper</a> from researchers at Apple (Cheng et al. 2020), they find excellent representations for EEG using a contrastive objective. This kind of approach is helpful to find good low-dimensional representations of messy signals, including, for instance, ECoG and local field potentials.</p>
<p><img src="https://xcorr.files.wordpress.com/2021/07/contrastive-learning.png?w=700" alt="contrastive-learning.png"></p>
<p>Adversarial networks is another area which contains many fruitful ideas. The same paper (Cheng et al. 2020) uses an adversarial critic to enforce that the representation <em>transfers</em> from subject to subject. Indeed, adversarial methods can be used to partition the latent space.</p>
<p>Finally, I&#8217;ll mention the use of normalizing flow models. Normalizing flow models are pretty slick: they learn a latent space using an invertible neural network. Learning is dead simple: you directly maximize the likelihood of the data, plus a correction for the Jacobian of the neural net &#8211; in some cases, you can even <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2001.04872">get rid of the Jacobian by using only volume-preserving transforms</a>. They&#8217;re a lot less finicky to make work than VAEs, in my humble opinion. They&#8217;re surprisingly flexible and I&#8217;d love to see them used more &#8211; to the best of my knowledge, pi-VAE is the first paper to use flow models in the context of neuroscience (albeit in a limited fashion). Normalizing flow models do have some significant limitations that will need to be worked around first (cannot directly model discontinuous distributions, latent space the same size as the observations).</p>
<h2>Gaps</h2>
<h3>Benchmarking</h3>
<p>What method is <em>best</em> to use on your data? It&#8217;s hard to tell. Most papers are built around gaining insight into a specific dataset, and there has been little systematic appraisal of which methods work best and when (not to mention runtime and counting how many knobs need to be tweaked). Chethan Pandarinath unveiled the <a href="https://neurallatents.github.io/">Neural Latents benchmark</a> at this year&#8217;s CoSyNe. I&#8217;m a big fan of this idea and will happily contribute as soon as it&#8217;s released.</p>
<h3>Packaging and software</h3>
<p>What method should you try on your data? Most of the methods listed in the taxonomies above are not plug-and-play affairs. In practice, if you&#8217;re an experimentalist and you don&#8217;t want to waste a ton of time getting something to work, you&#8217;ll pick from one of:</p>
<ul>
<li>Any number of classical, non-dynamic methods implemented in <a href="https://scikit-learn.org/stable/">scikit-learn</a></li>
<li><a href="https://elephant.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorials/gpfa.html">GPFA</a>, which has an excellent implementation in Elephant</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/lindermanlab/ssm">Linear dynamical systems (LDS) and derivatives</a>, including switching, Poisson, recurrent, and nonlinear mapping variants in the ssm package from the  Linderman lab. <a href="https://github.com/lindermanlab/ssm/tree/master/notebooks">Excellent tutorials</a>.</li>
<li>LFADS, which has implementations in <a href="https://github.com/tensorflow/models/tree/master/research/lfads">Tensorflow</a>, <a href="https://github.com/lyprince/hierarchical_lfads">PyTorch</a> and <a href="https://github.com/google-research/computation-thru-dynamics/blob/master/notebooks/LFADS%20Tutorial.ipynb">jax</a>. See also <a href="https://snel-repo.github.io/autolfads/">AutoLFADS</a> for a variant that can automatically search through hyperparameters in the cloud.</li>
</ul>
<p>Here&#8217;s one of the core problems: 2018 was perhaps the biggest year for new models (based on the taxonomies I&#8217;ve looked at). It&#8217;s also a year of huge change in machine learning pipelines: Theano was on its way out, TF2.0 wasn&#8217;t out yet, and PyTorch was evolving rapidly. Many of the methods discussed here are in github repos with less than ten stars, and only work on obsolete versions of TF, PyTorch or Theano, on old versions of CUDA. Getting them to run will likely mean running inside of nvidia-docker. <code>import antigravity</code> this is not.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s a path forward: benchmarking (above) should be done with existing methods using nvidia-docker, bale wire and chewing gum, and the most promising methods can then be selected for preservation inside of a well-documented package. That package could use the same conventions as sklearn (Elephant has an elegant implementation of GPFA built around this abstraction). It should pick one framework (probably PyTorch) and commit to maintaining the methods using, e.g. continuous integration. Furthermore, it should be available through a cloud platform, for instance through <a href="http://www.neurocaas.org">NeuroCAAS</a>. This would vastly increase the reach of more sophisticated analysis methods.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/alaska-yukon-delta-visualization-climate-change-land-transition">A stunning visualization of Alaska’s Yukon Delta shows a land in transition</a></h4>

              
                <p>The westward journey of the mighty Yukon River takes it from its headwaters in Canada’s British Columbia straight across Alaska. The river has many stories to tell, of generations of Indigenous people hunting on its banks and fishing in its waters, of paddle-wheeled boats and gold panning and pipelines.</p>



<p>Where it meets the Bering Sea, the river fans out into an intricate delta resembling cauliflower lobes of river channels and ponds. The delta has a story to tell, too — that of an increasingly green Arctic.</p>



<p>A composite image of the delta’s northern lobe, taken May 29 by the U.S. Geological Survey’s Landsat 8 satellite, shows willow shrublands lining river channels as they wind toward the sea. Farther inland, tussock grasses carpet the tundra. Grasslike sedge meadows populate low-lying wetlands, punctuated by ponds left behind by springtime floods along the riverbanks from snow and ice that have melted upstream.</p>



<p>In southern Alaska, such as in the Kenai Peninsula, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/climate-change-arctic-browning">the Arctic has been getting noticeably greener</a> since the 1980s, as global temperatures climb (<em>SN: 4/11/19</em>). Researchers observed this change using satellite measurements of red and near-infrared light reflected off the vegetation. Now, analyses of changing vegetation in the Yukon Delta and nearby Kuskokwim Delta show that<a href="https://journals.ametsoc.org/view/journals/eint/aop/EI-D-20-0025.1/EI-D-20-0025.1.xml"> more northern areas are getting greener too</a>, researchers report June 1 in <em>Earth Interactions</em>.</p>



<p>The increasing prevalence of tall willows, an important moose habitat, is one sign of these changes in the delta. Moose populations, too, are on the rise. But for the Yukon and other Arctic deltas — where higher floodwaters due to climate change are likely to deposit thicker sediment piles, supporting more greenery — many more changes are likely to come as the planet warms.&nbsp;</p>

<p><a href="https://bookshop.org/a/21798/9781635574944">Wild Souls</a><br><em>Emma Marris<br>Bloomsbury, $28</em></p>



<p>On the Arctic Ocean’s fringe, polar bears stand on ice thinning from human-caused climate change. Without thick ice from which to powerfully pounce on seals, many of these symbols of the wild north can’t eat.&nbsp;Should we feed polar bears to right our wrongs? Or should we leave them alone, even if that means they starve to extinction?</p>



<p>Emma Marris’ <em>Wild Souls </em>prompts readers to grapple with this question and more. An absorbing and nuanced blend of philosophy and science, the book explores what we owe the nonhuman world. Like her 2011 book <em>Rambunctious Garden</em>, which <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/book-review-rambunctious-garden-saving-nature-post-wild-world-emma-marris">challenged the notion</a> of “pristine wilderness” in a world where humans touch everything (<em>SN: 9/23/11</em>), <em>Wild Souls </em>questions the very concepts of wildness and nature. The result challenges readers to reconsider how they relate to nonhuman animals, from caged creatures to polar bears in the warming north.</p>





<p>Marris guides readers through a series of case studies, from Indigenous hunting practices to municipal zoos, all brought to life through attentive on-the-ground reporting. Running through these examples is a central ethical tension: How do we weigh the tangible moral value of an individual sentient creature who can suffer against the more abstract value of species or ecosystems, which are of course unfeeling but rouse such depths of emotion in us when they are threatened or lost?</p>





<p>Islands are a front line of this conflict, where life that’s blossomed in isolation is threatened by species we’ve introduced. Marris examines efforts, from the Galápagos to New Zealand, to kill (often painfully with poison) millions of individual mice, rats and other creatures in the name of preserving species deemed more important.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Marris is frank on where she stands on certain issues, arguing, for example, that zoos are immoral. She also asks whether it’s ever right to save a species like the California condor — which once soared above most of North America but dwindled to just a handful of individuals in the 1980s — by caging them for captive breeding.</p>



<p>The book makes a clear case for the moral value of individual sentient creatures, providing a rundown of the latest science that dissolves the distinct line often drawn between humans and nonhumans. These include studies that suggest fish feel pain and that rats help fellow rats in need because they <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/neuroscience-mice-may-catch-each-others-pain-relief-contagious">experience emotions</a> (<em>SN: 1/12/21</em>).</p>



<p>Defining the objective, inherent value of species proves trickier. “There’s something precious in what we call ‘nature,’ in the flow of energy, in the will to survive,” she writes. “But I cannot present overwhelming arguments that this is true. I can only passionately assert it.”</p>



<p>In the end, Marris finds no set formula for making ethical choices about animals’ fates. Instead, readers may realize something profound: There are no perfect ways to act ethically toward all animals and all species when incommensurable values collide. As we try to mend the mess we’ve made of nature, all we can do is act with thoughtful humility.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/oldest-archaea-microbe-fossil-fillaments-life-evolution">3.42-billion-year-old fossil threads may be the oldest known archaea microbes</a></h4>

              
                <p>Threadlike filaments pressed in rock <a href="https://advances.sciencemag.org/content/7/29/eabf3963">may be the remnants of archaea</a> that burped methane near hydrothermal vents 3.42 billion years ago. &nbsp;If so, these strands in rock excavated in South Africa around a decade ago, would provide the earliest direct evidence of a methane-based metabolism, researchers report July 14 in <em>Science Advances.</em></p>



<p>Such ancient fossil filaments may contain clues about Earth’s early inhabitants and hint at where to look for extraterrestrial life. &nbsp;Scientists suspect that <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/life-earth-origins-hostile-hot-springs-microbes">life on our planet</a> could have arisen in such an environment (<em>SN: 9/24/20</em>).</p>



<p>Biologists have deduced that metabolisms based on munching or belching methane evolved early on, but don’t know exactly when, says Barbara Cavalazzi, a geobiologist at University of Bologna in Italy. Previous research has found indirect evidence for methane-cycling microbes in the chemistry of fluid-filled pockets of ancient rocks from around 3.5 billion years ago. But that work didn’t find the actual microbes. With this fossil analysis, “what we find, basically, is evidence of about the same age. But this is a cellular remain — it’s the organism,” Cavalazzi says.</p>



<p>The newly identified fossil threads have a carbon-based shell. That shell is different structurally from the preserved interior, suggesting a cell envelope enclosing the cells’ insides, the authors write. And the team found relatively high nickel concentrations in the filaments. The concentrations were similar to levels found in modern methane-makers, suggesting the fossils’ metal may come from nickel-containing enzymes in the microbes.</p>





<p>“They can attribute a specific metabolic lifestyle to these early microorganisms,” says Dominic Papineau, a Precambrian biogeochemist at University College London, who was not part of the study and calls it “brilliant work.”</p>



<p>Yet the search for early life-forms has had <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/fake-fossil-biomorphs-more-common-ancient-rocks-real-fossils">its share of false signs</a> (<em>SN: 2/9/21</em>) , and some researchers aren’t convinced these fossils are the real deal. In silica-rich hydrothermal environments, the ingredients for structures that mimic cells mingle and can form life look-alikes through chemistry, says Julie Cosmidis, a geobiologist at the University of Oxford. “They fossilize better than actual cells, so I think it could very well be what those things are,” she says, pointing out that nickel, common in the early Earth, clings easily to organic matter, whether it’s living or not. “We don’t understand enough [about] the processes that can create false biosignatures,” says Cosmidis, whose lab studies such questions.</p>



<p>But Cavalazzi and her colleagues contend that the different lines of evidence together support the living origin of the microfossils. Papineau also notes that “the evidence is very good,” but adds that it’s “not necessarily rock solid.” Other tests could strengthen the case for the earliest methane-using microbes, he says.</p>



<p>If the strands are ancient archaea, they’d become the earliest fossil evidence for this domain of life, predating specimens from less than 500 million years ago. And if such microbes evolved so quickly on Earth, within around 1 billion years of the planet’s origin, methane-cyclers may be more common than realized on other planets where liquid water has been around for a while, Papineau says.</p>



<p>This fossil comes from a time when Earth’s planetary ecosystem was likely very different than it is now, says Boris Sauterey, a paleoecologist at the University of Arizona in Tempe, who wasn’t involved with this study. Back then, Earth most likely shared similarities with some of the extraterrestrial worlds that we today would consider potentially habitable, he says.</p>



<p>Researchers looking for signs of early life on Earth have explored sediments of surface waters more than hydrothermal systems, where these fossils were found, Cavalazzi says. The discovery suggests, she says, that here and on other planets, researchers should keep scratching below the surface.</p>

                <p><em>By&nbsp;</em><a href="http://emilyoliviareynolds.com/">Emily Reynolds</a></p>



<p>During the pandemic, many of us were locked down with little face-to-face contact with anybody other than our partners. Considering the stress of the time and the intensely close quarters we were in, you would be forgiven for thinking this was a recipe for serious tension.</p>



<p>A new study, however, suggests the reality might not be so cut and dry. <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/19485506211022813">Writing in <em>Social Psychological and Personality Science</em></a><em>, </em>a team led by Lisa A. Neff from The University of Texas at Austin found that the pandemic actually played an important part in people’s ability to deal with stress. When couples blamed their levels of stress on the pandemic, the team found, they were happier in their relationship.</p>



<span id="more-43014"></span>



<p>Participants were people living with their partner during the lockdown in the United States, who completed daily measures for 14 days during the April lockdown and then again seven months later (almost all couples were heterosexual, though several participants were non-binary).</p>



<p>In each questionnaire, participants indicated on a scale from one to five how much they blamed themselves, their partner, and the pandemic for their current levels of stress or problems. Next, participants were presented with eleven different parts of their life, from work to finances to household chores, and were asked to indicate how stressful or problematic that element of life had been that day. They also completed measures of relationship satisfaction, and indicated whether they had performed any negative behaviours towards their partner (e.g. criticising or directing anger towards their partner, or acting withdrawn or distant).</p>



<p>During both waves of the study, participants on the whole were more likely to blame the pandemic for feelings of stress than they were themselves or their partners. And blaming the pandemic seemed to be beneficial for their relationships, at least for the female participants: on days they found particularly stressful, women who blamed the pandemic for the stress reported greater satisfaction in their relationship than those who did not. They also reported behaving in fewer negative ways towards their partners, again suggesting that the act of blaming the pandemic acted as a buffering force in romantic relationships.</p>



<p>For female participants, the pandemic seemed to act as a “scapegoat”, as the team put it, which can protect relationships from undue stress. The team suggests that stress “spillover” — the spilling of external stressors like work into a relationship — was lessened due to heightened stress awareness and ability to blame a massive global event which was a very obvious source of stress. (Of course, it’s important to remember that many people <em>have</em> struggled with their relationships during the pandemic, and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2021/jan/16/im-grateful-for-our-intense-lockdown-split-what-has-the-pandemic-done-to-our-relationships">in some cases</a> the unique combination of factors thrown up by coronavirus really was a recipe for divorce.)</p>



<p>This spillover was also positioned as a reason why women participants were more likely to benefit from blaming the pandemic than men. Other research has suggested women experienced more distress during the pandemic, as well as more dissatisfaction with the allocation of tasks at home and their work-life balance. Women may therefore be more vulnerable to stress spillover — and this could be why they benefited more from blaming the stress on the pandemic.</p>



<p>Future work could look at periods of more intense stress. Although the pandemic as a whole was stressful for many, most participants in this study were experiencing low levels of stress on a daily basis; the daily diary method may also have felt labour intensive for those experiencing high levels of stress, leading them to drop out.</p>



<p>People may also have been blaming their stress on the pandemic precisely because it was caused by the pandemic: it’s not hard to imagine, for example, that stress and bad feelings have been triggered by pandemic-induced job insecurity, concerns about vulnerable relatives, or the monotony of lockdown. If that’s the case, it’s not a huge surprise that participants were happier in their relationship on days they blamed the pandemic — because there might not be anything wrong with their relationship to begin with.</p>



<p>On the whole, however, the findings suggest that relationships can thrive — or at least survive — when couples are aware of stress and feel able to discuss it openly: advice that probably holds outside of a pandemic as much as it does in.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/steven-weinberg-death-physics-electromagnetism-standard-model">With Steven Weinberg’s death, physics loses a titan</a></h4>

              
                <p>Mythology has its titans. So do the movies. And so does physics. Just one fewer now.</p>



<p>Steven Weinberg died July 23, at the age of 88. He was one of the key intellectual leaders in physics during the second half of the 20th century, and he remained a leading voice and active contributor and teacher through the first two decades of the 21st.</p>



<p>On lists of the greats of his era he was always mentioned along with Richard Feynman, Murray Gell-Mann and … well, just Feynman and Gell-Mann.</p>



<p>Among his peers, Weinberg was one of the most respected figures in all of physics or perhaps all of science. He exuded intelligence and dignity. As news of his death spread through Twitter, other physicists expressed their remorse at the loss: “One of the most accomplished scientists of our age,” one commented, “a particularly eloquent spokesman for the scientific worldview.” And another: “One of the best physicists we had, one of the best thinkers of any variety.”</p>





<p>Weinberg’s <a href="https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/physics/1979/summary/">Nobel Prize, awarded in 1979</a>, was for his role in developing a theory unifying electromagnetism and the weak nuclear force. That was an essential contribution to what became known as the standard model of physics, a masterpiece of explanation for phenomena rooted in the math describing subatomic particles and forces. It’s so successful at explaining experimental results that physicists have long pursued every opportunity to find the slightest deviation, in hopes of identifying “new” physics that further deepens human understanding of nature.</p>



<p>Weinberg did important technical work in other realms of physics as well, and wrote several authoritative textbooks on such topics as general relativity and cosmology and quantum field theory. He was an early advocate of superstring theory as a promising path in the continuing quest to complete the standard model by unifying it with general relativity, Einstein’s theory of gravity.</p>



<p>Early on Weinberg also realized a desire to communicate more broadly. His popular book <em>The First Three Minutes</em>, published in 1977, introduced a generation of physicists and physics fans to the Big Bang–birth of the universe and the fundamental science underlying that metaphor. Later he wrote deeply insightful examinations of the nature of science and its intersection with society. And he was a longtime contributor of thoughtful essays in such venues as the <em>New York Review of Books</em>.</p>



<p>In his 1992 book <em>Dreams of a Final Theory</em>, Weinberg expressed his belief that physics was on the verge of finding the true fundamental explanation of reality, the “final theory” that would unify all of physics. Progress toward that goal seemed to be impeded by the apparent incompatibility of general relativity with quantum mechanics, the math underlying the standard model. But in a 1997 interview, Weinberg averred that the difficulty of combining relativity and quantum physics in a mathematically consistent way was an important clue. “When you put the two together, you find that there really isn’t that much free play in the laws of nature,” he said. “That’s been an enormous help to us because it’s a guide to what kind of theories might possibly work.”</p>



<p>Attempting to bridge the relativity-quantum gap, he believed, “pushed us a tremendous step forward toward being able to develop realistic theories of nature on the basis of just mathematical calculations and pure thought.”</p>



<p>Experiment had to come into play, of course, to verify the validity of the mathematical insights. But the standard model worked so well that finding deviations implied by new physics required more powerful experimental technology than physicists possessed. “We have to get to a whole new level of experimental competence before we can do experiments that reveal the truth beneath the standard model, and this is taking a long, long time,” he said. “I really think that physics in the style in which it’s being done … is going to eventually reach a final theory, but probably not while I’m around and very likely not while you’re around.”</p>



<p>He was right that he would not be around to see the final theory. And perhaps, as he sometimes acknowledged, nobody ever will. Perhaps it’s not experimental power that is lacking, but rather intellectual power. “Humans may not be smart enough to understand the really fundamental laws of physics,” he wrote in his 2015 book <em>To Explain the World</em>, a history of science up to the time of Newton.</p>



<p>Weinberg studied the history of science thoroughly, wrote books and taught courses on it. <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/steven-weinberg-looks-back-rise-scientific-method"><em>To Explain the World</em></a> was explicitly aimed at assessing ancient and medieval science in light of modern knowledge. For that he incurred the criticism of historians and others who claimed he did not understand the purpose of history, which is to understand the human endeavors of an era on its own terms, not with anachronistic hindsight.</p>



<p>But Weinberg understood the viewpoint of the historians perfectly well. He just didn’t like it. For Weinberg, the story of science that was meaningful to people today was how the early stumblings toward understanding nature evolved into a surefire system for finding correct explanations. And that took many centuries. Without the perspective of where we are now, he believed, and an appreciation of the lessons we have learned, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/blog/context/physicists-story-science-breaks-historians-rules">the story of how we got here “has no point.”</a></p>



<p>Future science historians will perhaps insist on assessing Weinberg’s own work in light of the standards of his times. But even if viewed in light of future knowledge, there’s no doubt that Weinberg’s achievements will remain in the realm of the Herculean. Or the titanic.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coronavirus-covid-19-booster-shots-vaccines-immunocompromised-people">What experts know so far about COVID-19 boosters for immunocompromised people</a></h4>

              
                <p>People with weak immune systems don’t always mount strong defenses against the coronavirus, even after being fully vaccinated. A third COVID-19 vaccine dose might help protect some immunocompromised people, evidence suggests. But for now, there’s not enough data to say how much such a shot might help, experts with the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said July 22. As a result, the agency isn’t yet recommending a third dose and says that vaccinated people in this group should keep wearing masks.</p>



<p>With global COVID-19 cases on the rise, finding ways to protect millions of immunocompromised people who are at high risk for severe disease is crucial. In the United States, an estimated 2.7 percent of adults, or 6.8 million people, are immunocompromised.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Studies suggest that until transmission of the coronavirus is squashed, millions of <a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2779852">organ transplant recipients</a>, cancer patients undergoing treatment and others are still susceptible to severe COVID-19, even if they are <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/covid-19-global-inequity-vaccines-deaths-economy-pandemic">lucky enough to have access to shots</a> (<em>SN: 2/26/21</em>). Of 45 vaccinated people admitted to 18 U.S. hospitals for COVID-19 from March 11 to May 5, <a href="https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.07.08.21259776v1">twenty, or 44 percent, were immunocompromised</a>, according to data presented in a July 22 meeting of the CDC’s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices. </p>

<p>A third dose of COVID-19 vaccines can boost coronavirus-fighting antibodies in the blood of some immunocompromised patients, laboratory studies suggest. But it’s still unclear whether specific groups might benefit more than others and how effective extra doses might be at preventing severe COVID-19. The immune system, for instance, has <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/covid-19-vaccines-coronavirus-variants-challenges">more than antibodies in its arsenal to attack the coronavirus</a> and prevent severe disease (<em>SN: 1/27/21</em>). Studies from the real world would provide a clearer picture for how well additional doses might work, and for which groups.&nbsp;</p>



<p>At the very least, an additional dose appears safe for immunocompromised individuals, epidemiologist Sara Oliver of the CDC said at the July 22 meeting. For example, a study that included patients on dialysis for kidney disease showed that “symptoms reported after the third dose were consistent with what has been seen after the second dose,” Oliver said. Most vaccine side effects — such as fatigue, pain at the injection site, chills or soreness — were mild.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>While U.S. officials are still discussing the benefits of the additional dose, some countries have already taken steps to get those doses to immunocompromised residents. Severely immunocompromised people in France, for instance, can get a third dose a month after their second dose, officials announced April 11. Officials in Israel announced July 11 that they too would begin giving immunocompromised individuals a third shot. And officials in the United Kingdom have proposed distributing additional doses between September and December.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Here’s a summary of what studies have found so far about the merits of an extra COVID-19 shot for the immunocompromised:&nbsp;</p>



<ul><li>A third dose of a COVID-19 vaccine — either Pfizer’s, Moderna’s or Johnson &amp; Johnson’s — <a href="https://www.acpjournals.org/doi/10.7326/L21-0282">boosted the antibody levels</a> of some organ transplant recipients with previously weak responses to the vaccine, researchers reported June 15 in <em>Annals of Internal Medicine</em>. Of 30 vaccinated patients, six people had low levels of antibodies that recognized the coronavirus before getting a third dose. Another 24 did not have detectable antibodies. Two weeks after their third shot, all six patients with initially low antibody levels now had high amounts. Of the 24 people without antibodies, 16 still didn’t develop any, two had low levels and six developed high levels of antibodies.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li></ul>



<ul><li>Another study showed that 67 out of 99 organ transplant recipients vaccinated with Pfizer’s jab <a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMc2108861">had detectable antibodies after a third dose</a>, researchers reported June 23 in the <em>New England Journal of Medicine</em>. That’s compared with four of 101 individuals after a first dose and 40 of 99 after a second. Of the 59 people who didn’t have antibodies after the second dose, 26, or 44 percent, mounted the immune proteins after the extra dose.&nbsp;</li></ul>



<ul><li>More than 75 percent of blood, or hematopoietic, <a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(21)01594-4/fulltext">stem cell transplant recipients had detectable antibodies after two doses</a> of Pfizer’s COVID-19 vaccine, researchers reported July 13 in the <em>Lancet</em>. Fifty-two of the 88 patients in the study had antibody levels above a threshold that corresponds to how well the immune proteins stop the coronavirus from infecting cells. Those who had received the transplant more than a year before getting vaccinated, and who had high numbers of pathogen-fighting white blood cells, were more likely to have lots of antibodies. Patients given treatments that suppressed their immune systems within three months of getting vaccinated, on the other hand, had low antibody levels, the team found. A third dose might be helpful for that group, but experts don’t know yet.&nbsp;</li></ul>



<ul><li>Third doses can also help some patients on dialysis for kidney disease, studies suggest. Of 12 dialysis patients who initially didn’t generate antibodies after two vaccine doses, <a href="https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.07.02.21259913v1">half mounted an antibody response after an extra shot</a>, researchers reported in a preliminary study posted July 6 at medRxiv.org. Forty-two percent, or<a href="https://academic.oup.com/ndt/advance-article/doi/10.1093/ndt/gfab193/6289996"> 5 out of 12 antibody-negative patients</a>, had antibodies after a third vaccine, another group of researchers reported May 31 in <em>Nephrology Dialysis Transplantation</em>.&nbsp;</li></ul>



<p>In the United States, a recommendation for an additional dose for immunocompromised people probably won’t come unless the Food and Drug Administration permits extra doses under current emergency use authorizations for COVID-19 vaccines or until the agency fully approves the vaccines for widespread use, CDC officials said during the meeting. For now, the health agency isn’t aware of any data submitted to the FDA that might support such a change to the emergency use authorizations, the officials said.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In the meantime, experts are keeping a close eye on emerging data about additional doses. “However, while we do that, we need to remember what we can do now,” Oliver said. That means immunocompromised people should continue to wear masks, stay six feet away from others and avoid crowds or indoor spaces. </p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/star-age-calculation-astronomy-life-cycle">How do scientists calculate the age of a star?</a></h4>

              
                <p>We know quite a lot about stars. After centuries of pointing telescopes at the night sky, astronomers and amateurs alike can figure out key attributes of any star, like its mass or its composition.</p>



<p>To calculate a star’s mass, just look it its orbital period and do a bit of algebra. To determine what it’s made of, look to the spectrum of light the star emits. But the one variable scientists haven’t quite cracked yet is time.</p>



<p>“The sun is the only star we know the age of,” says astronomer David Soderblom of the Space Telescope Science Institute in Baltimore. “Everything else is bootstrapped up from there.”</p>



<p>Even well-studied stars surprise scientists every now and then. In 2019 when the red supergiant star Betelgeuse dimmed, astronomers weren’t sure if it was just going through a phase or if a supernova explosion was imminent. (<a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/betelgeuse-dust-cold-spell-why-giant-star-dimmed">Turns out it was just a phase</a>.) The sun also shook things up when scientists noticed that it wasn’t behaving like other middle-aged stars. It’s not as <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/sun-less-magnetically-active-than-similar-stars">magnetically active</a> compared with other stars of the same age and mass. That suggests that astronomers might not fully understand the timeline of middle age.</p>





<p>Calculations based on physics and indirect measurements of a star’s age <a href="https://www.annualreviews.org/doi/10.1146/annurev-astro-081309-130806">can give astronomers ballpark estimates</a>. And some methods work better for different types of stars. Here are three ways astronomers calculate the age of a star.</p>



<h3>Hertzsprung-Russell diagrams</h3>



<p>Scientists do have a pretty good handle on how stars are born, how they live and how they die. For instance, stars burn through their hydrogen fuel, puff up and eventually expel their gases into space, whether with a bang or a whimper. But when exactly each stage of a star’s life cycle happens is where things get complicated. Depending on their mass, certain stars hit those points after a different number of years. More massive stars die young, while less massive stars can burn for billions of years.</p>



<p>At the turn of the 20th century, two astronomers — Ejnar Hertzsprung and Henry Norris Russell — independently came up with the idea to<a href="https://astronomy.swin.edu.au/cosmos/h/hertzsprung-russell+diagram"> plot stars’ temperature against their brightness</a>. The patterns on these Hertzsprung-Russell, or H-R, diagrams corresponded to where different stars were in that life cycle. Today, scientists use these patterns to determine the age of star clusters, whose stars are thought to have all formed at the same time.</p>



<p>The caveat is that, unless you do a lot of math and modeling, this method can be used only for stars in clusters, or by comparing a single star’s color and brightness with theoretical H-R diagrams. “It’s not very precise,” says astronomer Travis Metcalfe of the Space Science Institute in Boulder, Colo. “Nevertheless, it’s the best thing we’ve got.”</p>

<h3>Rotation rate</h3>



<p>By the 1970s, astrophysicists had noticed a trend: Stars in younger clusters spin faster than stars in older clusters. In 1972, astronomer Andrew Skumanich used a star’s rotation rate and surface activity to <a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1972ApJ...171..565S/abstract">propose a simple equation to estimate a star’s age</a>: Rotation rate = (Age)<sup> -½</sup>.</p>



<p>This was the go-to method for individual stars for decades, but new data have poked holes in its utility. It turns out that some stars don’t slow down when they hit a certain age. Instead they keep the same rotation speed for the rest of their lives.</p>



<p>“Rotation is the best thing to use for stars younger than the sun,” Metcalfe says. For stars older than the sun, other methods are better.</p>



<h3>Stellar seismology</h3>



<p>The new data that confirmed rotation rate wasn’t the best way to estimate an individual star’s age came from an unlikely source: the exoplanet-hunting <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/planet-hunting-kepler-space-telescope-dead">Kepler space telescope</a>. Not just a boon for exoplanet research, Kepler pushed stellar seismology to the forefront by simply staring at the same stars for a really long time.</p>



<p>Watching a star flicker can give clues to its age. Scientists look at changes in a star’s brightness as an indicator of what’s happening beneath the surface and, through modeling, roughly calculate the star’s age. To do this, one needs a really big dataset on the star’s brightness — which the Kepler telescope could provide.</p>



<p>“Everybody thinks it was all about finding planets, which was true,” Soderblom says. “But I like to say that the Kepler mission was a stealth stellar physics mission.”</p>



<p>This approach helped reveal the sun’s magnetic midlife crisis and recently provided some clues about the evolution of the Milky Way. Around 10 billion years ago, our galaxy <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/milky-way-feasted-smaller-galaxy-10-billion-years-ago">collided</a> with a dwarf galaxy. Scientists have found that <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/milky-way-galaxy-origins-merger-collision-star-age">stars left behind by that dwarf galaxy are younger or about the same age</a> as stars original to the Milky Way. Thus, the Milky Way may have evolved more quickly than previously thought.</p>



<p>As space telescopes like <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/stars-may-keep-spinning-fast-long-old-age">NASA’s TESS</a> and the European Space Agency’s<a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/a-new-mission-to-investigate-exoplanets-has-rocketed-into-space"> CHEOPS</a> survey new patches of sky, astrophysicists will be able to learn more about the stellar life cycle and come up with new estimates for more stars.</p>



<p>Aside from curiosity about the stars in our own backyard, star ages have implications beyond our solar system, from planet formation to galaxy evolution — and even the search for extraterrestrial life.</p>



<p>“One of these days — it’ll probably be a while — somebody’s going to claim they see signs of life on a planet around another star. The first question people will ask is, ‘How old is that star?’” Soderblom says. “That’s going to be a tough question to answer.&#8221;</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/skeleton-oldest-known-shark-attack-victim-japan">A partial skeleton reveals the world’s oldest known shark attack</a></h4>

              
                <p>Somewhere off southeastern Japan’s coast around 3,000 years ago, a shark attacked and killed a man who was likely fishing or shellfish diving. Afterward, the victim’s fishing comrades presumably brought the body, minus its sheared off right leg and left hand, back to land for burial.</p>



<p>A new analysis of that unfortunate man’s partial skeleton, excavated around a century ago at a village cemetery near Japan’s Seto Inland Sea, has unveiled that grisly scenario. This individual from <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/jomon-genes">Japan’s ancient Jōmon culture</a> (<em>SN: 2/15/97</em>) represents the oldest known human victim of a shark attack, say archaeologist J. Alyssa White of the University of Oxford and colleagues. Radiocarbon dating <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352409X21002777">places his death from 3,391 to 3,031 years ago</a>, the researchers report in the August<em> Journal of Archaeological Science: Reports</em>.</p>



<p>A roughly <a href="https://www.floridamuseum.ufl.edu/caribarch/education/sharks/">1,000-year-old skeleton of a fisherman on Puerto Rico</a> previously displayed the earliest signs of a shark encounter.</p>



<p>White’s group documented at least 790 gouges, punctures and other types of bite damage mainly confined to the Jōmon man’s arms, legs, pelvis and ribs. A 3-D model of these injuries indicates that the victim first lost his left hand trying to fend off a shark. Ensuing bites severed major leg arteries, rapidly leading to death.</p>



<p>After the man’s body was recovered, his mutilated left leg probably detached and was placed on his chest when he was buried, the researchers say.</p>



<p>Numerous shark teeth found at some Jōmon sites suggest that sharks were hunted, perhaps by drawing them to blood while fishing at sea. “But unprovoked shark attacks would have been incredibly rare as sharks do not tend to target humans as prey,” White says.</p>

                <p>This month's episode features Mark Humphries, author of "<a href="https://amzn.to/3u7G6Wo">The Spike: An Epic Journey Through the Brain in 2.1 Seconds."</a> We explore how the brain uses electrical signaling in surprising ways, beginning with a look at how an action potential (aka. "the spike") is produced. Then we consider what Humphries calls "the dark neurons," which are neurons that rarely generate spikes. We explore their role and also how it relates to the brain's spontaneous activity. One of the more surprising recent discoveries in neuroscience is that most of the brain's activity does not appear to be caused by external stimuli. It is not a passive receiver of information and this has profound implications for our understanding of things like how the brain generates conscious experience.</p> <p>This episode is for listeners of all backgrounds.</p> <p>Links and References:</p> <ul> <li><a href="https://amzn.to/3u7G6Wo" target="_blank" rel= "noopener"><em>The Spike: An Epic Journey Through the Brain in 2.1 Seconds</em></a> by Mark Humphries</li> <li><a href="https://www.humphries-lab.org" target="_blank" rel= "noopener">Humphries Lab</a> at the University of Nottingham</li> <li>Please visit <a href= "http://brainsciencepodcast.com/">http://brainsciencepodcast.com</a> for additonal references and episode transcripts.</li> </ul> Please Visit Our Sponsors: <ul> <li><a href= "https://textexpander.com/podcast?utm_source=brainscience&utm_medium=podcast&utm_campaign=textexpander-July-2021" target="_blank" rel="noopener">TextExpander at textexpander.com/podcast</a></li> <li><a href="http://NordVPN.com/brainscience" target="_blank" rel= "noopener">NordVPN at nordvpn.com/brainscience</a></li> </ul> <p>Announcements:</p> <ul> <li><a href="http://brainsciencepodcast.com/"><em>Brain Science</em></a> comes out on 4th Friday each month.</li> <li>Support <em>Brain Science</em> by buying <a href="https://brainsciencepodcast.com/books"><em>Are You Sure?

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/mars-quakes-seismic-waves-red-planet-liquid-core-half-diameter-nasa">Marsquakes reveal the Red Planet boasts a liquid core half its diameter</a></h4>

              
                <p>Mars has had its first CT scan, thanks to analyses of seismic waves picked up by NASA’s InSight lander. Diagnosis: The Red Planet’s core is at least partially liquid, as some previous studies had suggested, and is somewhat larger than expected.</p>



<p>InSight <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/nasa-insight-lander-has-touched-down-safely-mars">reached Mars in late 2018</a> and soon afterward <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/nasa-mars-insight-lander-first-recording-marsquake">detected the first known marsquake</a> (<em>SN: 11/26/</em><em>18</em>; <em>SN: 4/23/19</em>). Since then, the lander’s instruments have picked up more than a thousand temblors, most of them minor rumbles. Many of those quakes originated at a seismically active region more than 1,000 kilometers away from the lander. A small fraction of the quakes had magnitudes ranging from 3.0 to 4.0, and the resulting vibrations have enabled scientists to probe Mars and reveal new clues about its inner structure.</p>



<p>Simon Stähler, a seismologist at ETH Zurich, and colleagues analyzed seismic waves from 11 marsquakes, looking for two types of waves: pressure and shear. Unlike pressure waves, shear waves can’t pass through a liquid, and they move more slowly, traveling side to side through solid materials, rather than in a push-and-pull motion in the same direction a wave is traveling like pressure waves do.</p>







<p>Of those 11 events, six sets of vibrations included shear waves strong enough to stand out from background noise. The strength of those shear waves suggests that they reflected off of the outer surface of a liquid core, rather than entering a solid core and being partially absorbed, Stähler says. And the difference in arrival times at InSight for the pressure waves and shear waves for each quake suggest that <a href="https://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/doi/10.1126/science.abi7730">Mars’ core is about 3,660 kilometers in diameter</a>, he and colleagues report in the July 23 <em>Science</em>.</p>



<p>That’s a little more than half of the diameter of the entire planet, larger than most previous estimates. The Red Planet’s core is so big, in fact, that it blocks InSight from receiving certain types of seismic waves from a large part of the planet. That, in turn, suggests that Mars may be more seismically active than the lander’s sensors can detect. Indeed, one of the regions in the lander’s seismic blind spot is the Tharsis region, home to some of Mars’ largest volcanoes. Volcanic activity there, as well as the motion of molten rock within the crust in that region, could trigger quakes or seismic waves.</p>

<p>While the newly analyzed data confirm the planet’s outer core is liquid, it’s not clear yet whether Mars has a solid inner core like Earth, says study coauthor Amir Khan, a geophysicist also at ETH Zurich. “The signal should be there in the seismic data,” he says. “We just need to locate it.”</p>



<p>In a separate analysis also published in <em>Science</em>, Khan and colleagues suggest that InSight’s seismic blind spot may also stem, in part, from the way that <a href="https://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/doi/10.1126/science.abf2966">seismic waves slow down and bend as they travel deep within the planet</a>. Changes in seismic wave speed and direction can result from gradual variations in rock temperature or density, for example.</p>



<p>Mars’ seismic waves also hint at the thickness of the planet’s crust. As they bounce back and forth within the planet, the waves bounce off interfaces between different layers and types of rocks, says Brigitte Knapmeyer-Endrun, a seismologist at the University of Cologne in Bergisch Gladbach, Germany. In a separate study in <em>Science</em>, she and her team analyzed seismic signals that reflected off several such interfaces near Mars’ surface, making it difficult to determine the depth at which the planet’s crust ends and the underlying mantle begins, she says. The researchers concluded, however, that <a href="https://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/doi/10.1126/science.abf8966">the average thickness of the crust likely lies between 24 and 72 kilometers</a>. For comparison, Earth’s oceanic crust is about 6 to 7 kilometers thick, while the planet&#8217;s continental crust averages from 35 to 40 kilometers thick.</p>



<p>Together, these seismic analyses are the first to investigate the innards of a rocky planet other than Earth, Stähler says. As such, they provide “ground truth” for measurements made by spacecraft orbiting Mars, and could help scientists better interpret data gathered from orbit around other planets, such as Mercury and Venus.</p>



<p>The findings could also provide insights that would help planetary scientists better understand how Mars formed and evolved over the life of the solar system, and how the Red Planet ended up so unalike Earth, says Sanne Cottaar, a geophysicist at the University of Cambridge. Cottaar wrote <a href="https://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/doi/10.1126/science.abj8914">a commentary</a>, also published in <em>Science</em>, on the new research. “Mars was put together with similar building blocks” as Earth, she says, “but had a different result.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/pterosaurs-fossil-flight-hatchling">Pterosaurs may have been able to fly as soon as they hatched</a></h4>

              
                <p>Pterosaur hatchlings may have been able to fly right out of the shell — although the flight of those ancient baby reptiles might have looked a bit different from that of the adults.</p>



<p>A new analysis of the fossilized wing bones of embryonic, newly hatched and adult pterosaurs suggests the baby creatures <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-021-92499-z">were strong and nimble fliers</a> from the start, researchers report July 22 in <em>Scientific Reports</em>.</p>



<p>Pterosaurs were a diverse group of ancient flying reptiles that lived alongside dinosaurs from the Triassic to the Cretaceous periods, 228 million to 66 million years ago. The group includes <em>Quetzalcoatlus northropi</em>, the largest creature known to take wing, and <em>Kunpengopterus antipollicatus</em> (<a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/monkeydactyl-jurassic-pterosaur-oldest-fossil-opposable-thumbs">aka “Monkeydactyl”</a>) which had opposable thumbs that enabled it to climb trees (<em>SN: 4/14/21</em>).</p>



<p>Scientists know relatively little about the early life history of pterosaurs, including whether their young could actively flap their wings or only glide — which might mean they stayed under parental care until they were flight-ready. But recent revelations increasingly point toward early independence, or “precociality,” for the reptiles, such as finding <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/429621a">flight membranes on the wings</a> of an embryonic pterosaur, and the discovery of a tiny <em>Pteranodon</em> juvenile that was <a href="https://doi.org/10.1017/jpa.2017.84">capable of long-distance flying long before it had grown to adult size</a>.</p>





<p>“Baby pterosaurs almost certainly didn’t glide,” they flew, says Kevin Padian, a paleontologist at the University of California, Berkeley, who was not part of the new study. The three keys to flight, he says, are strong bones, sufficient muscle mass to stay in the air for a long time and sturdy keratin fibers in the skin of the wings, analogous to the feathers of birds. “We know little about the last two.”</p>



<p>So researchers turned to the bones. Darren Naish, a paleontologist at the University of Southampton in England, and his colleagues compared fossilized embryo and hatchling wing measurements with those of adults from two species, <em>Pterodaustro guinazui</em> and <em>Sinopterus dongi</em>. The researchers analyzed wingspans, the strength of wing bones and how much load the wings could carry. In particular, they zeroed in on one wing bone, the humerus. That bone is found on the limbs pterosaurs use to launch themselves into flight and offers key information on whether a pterosaur was capable of getting off the ground.</p>



<p>The hatchlings’ humerus bones were surprisingly stronger than those of many of the adults, the team found. The hatchlings also had shorter and broader wings than the adults, suggesting they might have been capable of nimbly changing direction and speed, if <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/pterosaurs-might-have-soared-10000-miles-nonstop">not flying long distances</a> (<em>SN: 10/12/10</em>).</p>



<p>Agile flying may have helped the hatchlings not only escape predators, but also chase tricky prey such as insects, all while navigating dense vegetation, the team suggests. Adult pterosaurs, less able to maneuver due to their size, may have then switched to more open habitats.</p>



<p>Among modern birds, the ability to fly immediately after hatching is almost unknown — with the notable exception of the maleo, a strange chickenlike bird that lives only on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi. The maleo’s ability to take flight right away helps it avoid being snapped up by the island’s various predators, from monitor lizards to pythons.</p>



<p>Still, it isn’t unusual in most of the animal world for young to be able to fend for themselves, Padian says. “Precociality is the rule, not the exception, in vertebrates,” he says. Only animals with extended parental care — like songbirds or primates — can afford to be helpless for any extended period of time.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://gcamp6f.com/2021/07/22/fast-scanning-triplet-states-and-photon-yield/">Fast scanning, triplet states and photon yield</a></h4>

              
                <p>In point-scanning microscopy like two-photon or confocal microscopy, a focused laser beam is scanned across the field of view and thereby sequentially recovers an image of the object. In this blog post, I will discuss the idea that scanning faster across the field of view would increase the total amount of collected fluorescence. This idea is based on the experimental finding that high-intensity laser light could induce long-lived and non-fluorescent triplet states of the fluorophore molecule while scanning the sample; when the laser is scanned only slowly across the sample, it would therefore try to image fluorophores that are already in their &#8220;dark&#8221; triplet states. Imaging dark fluorophores would result in an overall decreased fluorescence yield. I tested this hypothesis directly with resonant scanning two-photon microscopy in the living brain tissue together with typical fluorophores (GCaMP6f, OGB-1). The main result from these experiments is that I could not find a substantial effect of the triplet states under these realistic conditions, and therefore no advantage in terms of fluorescence yield gained by an increased scan speed.</p>



<p><strong>Introduction</strong></p>



<p>Fluorophores are molecules that can re-emit light after absorbing a photon themselves. This effect of fluorescence can be described as a state change of the fluorophore from ground state to an excited state upon absorption of the incoming photon, and as a state change from an excited state back to the ground state, together with emission of the outgoing photon (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jablonski_diagram">see this Wikipedia article</a>). The lifetime of the fluorescent state is often a few nanoseconds. However, there are often additional excited states that are more long-lived, such as so-called triplet states. The transition probabilities from ground state to triplet state (and vice versa) are very low due to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intersystem_crossing">exclusion principle</a> that derives from quantum spin mechanics. The lower transition probabilities make these states less likely to occur during fluorescence microscopy but also render the triplet state longer-lived once it is attained. These <strong>long-lived triplet states</strong> could have rather undesired consequences, since a fluorophore in the triplet state is unable to absorb or emit photons, therefore becoming &#8220;dark&#8221; or non-functional from the experimenter&#8217;s perspective.</p>



<p>When triplet states play a prominent role in laser-scanning microscopy, one can avoid their detrimental effects by simply scanning faster. Scanning slowly across the sample means that the same fluorophores are hit with light over and over within a short time window. In such a scenario, some of the fluorophores are already in a dark triplet states, resulting in lower overall fluorescence. Faster scanning avoids this problem, and it has been shown for confocal microscopy (<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16878313/">Borlinghaus, 2006</a>) as well as STEP microscopy (<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nmeth.3481">Schneider et al., 2015</a>; <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/srep14766">Wu et al., 2015</a>) that a large signal increase can be achieved simply by faster scanning.</p>



<p>For two-photon microscopy, the situation is less clear. It has been shown that scanning at all compared to non-scanning two-photon fluorescence correlation spectroscopy results in higher photon yield (<a href="https://chemistry-europe.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1002/cphc.200700579">Petrášek and Schwille, 2008</a>), but this specific fluorescence configuration cannot be translated easily to two-photon imaging used by neuroscientists. However, there is one publication that demonstrated that <strong>microsecond-long triplet states</strong> do play a large role for two-photon microscopy (<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nmeth986">Donnert et al., 2007</a>). This paper has been cited as a standard reference to justify the advantages of fast scanning approaches (e.g., <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nature10193">Chen et al., 2011</a>), and some two-photon microscopy approaches directly designed their scanning approaches to reduce triplet-induced reduction of fluorescence yield (<a href="https://www.osapublishing.org/boe/fulltext.cfm?uri=boe-6-10-4027">Gautam et al., 2015</a>; <a href="https://www.osapublishing.org/boe/fulltext.cfm?uri=boe-7-12-5325">Castanares et al., 2016</a>; <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-020-15618-w">Karpf et al., 2020</a>). However, another study showed an effect that seemed to be contradictory to the Donnert et al. results (<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nmeth.1175">Ji et al., 2008</a>), and the interpretation of both papers was discussed repeatedly, e.g., by <a href="https://brainwindows.wordpress.com/2008/02/18/pulse-shaping-for-2-photon-signal-enhancement/">Andrew Hires</a> and on <a href="http://labrigger.com/blog/2011/12/31/optimizing-pulse-frequency-for-2p-imaging/">Labrigger</a>. The consensus, if there was any, seemed to be that it probably depends on the sample. The experiments by Donnert et al. had been done with GFP fixed on a coverslip, but one can easily imagine that a fluorescent protein in vivo might behave differently.</p>



<p>So I decided to probe these results with typical samples and procedures used by neuroscientists &#8211; using video-rate calcium imaging of neurons in the living brain. I did not do this out of pure curiosity about photophysics, but because of the implications of these photophysics for the design of two-photon imaging modalities. If triplet states were indeed an important factor for two-photon imaging of such samples as suggested by Donnert et al., a slightly modified scanning scheme (or parallelized scanning schemes, as reviewed by <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6037565/">Weissenburger and Vaziri, 2018</a>, Figure 3) or adapted laser repetition rates would have huge benefits for the total fluorescence yield.</p>



<p>The main finding of the Donnert et al. paper was the induction of dark triplet states by the scanning laser, and a key prediction was that faster scanning would decrease the probability that an imaged fluorophore is in a dark state; in short, that <strong>faster scanner would increase fluorescence yield</strong>. Therefore, I wanted to systematically understand whether fluorescence for two-photon microscopy depends on scan speed. To study this dependence experimentally in a typical in vivo sample , I used a resonant scanning microscope. For a resonant scanning microscope, the physical scan speed across the sample can be adjusted by changing the scan amplitude (often called the Zoom setting). High zoom would result in low scan speed across the sample, while low zoom would result in high scan speed, enabling a simple characterization of scan speed versus fluorescence yield. According to Donnert et al., higher scan speed would result in higher fluorescence yield compared to slower scan speed when imaging the same spot.</p>



<p><strong>Experimental approach</strong></p>



<p>For a resonant scanning microscope, the scan speed can be derived from the position x(t) of the laser beam focus:</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center"><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x%28t%29+%3D+x_0+%5Ccdot+sin%28+t+%5Ccdot+f_%7Bres%7D+%5Ccdot+2+%5Cpi+%29&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="x(t) = x_0 &#92;cdot sin( t &#92;cdot f_{res} &#92;cdot 2 &#92;pi )" class="latex" />,</p>



<p>with the resonant frequency (f = 8 kHz) and the amplitude (x<sub>0</sub> = 500 μm), which determines roughly the size of the field of view (FOV, here: 1000 μm). The scan speed v(t) is the derivative of the position x(t) with respect to time and therefore also follows a sinusoidal trajectory that reaches its peak in the center of the FOV:</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center"><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=v%28t%29+%3D+x_0%5Ccdot+f_%7Bres%7D+%5Ccdot+2+%5Cpi+%5Ccdot+cos%28+t+%5Ccdot+f_%7Bres%7D+%5Ccdot+2+%5Cpi+%29&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="v(t) = x_0&#92;cdot f_{res} &#92;cdot 2 &#92;pi &#92;cdot cos( t &#92;cdot f_{res} &#92;cdot 2 &#92;pi )" class="latex" />,</p>



<p>with the speed at the center of the FOV given by</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center"><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=v_%7Bmax%7D+%3D+x_0%5Ccdot+f_%7Bres%7D+%5Ccdot+2+%5Cpi&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="v_{max} = x_0&#92;cdot f_{res} &#92;cdot 2 &#92;pi" class="latex" />.</p>



<p>For higher zoom values (i.e., a smaller FOV), the value is reduced by the same factor (at least in the microscopy software I used for these experiments!). Thereby, it is possible to test a wide range of scan speeds just be changing the zoom setting of the resonant scanner. Since the resonant scanner can span zoom levels between 1x to 20x (for much higher zoom settings, a resonant scanner can become unstable due to the small scan amplitude), a range of speeds between 25 μm/μs and 1.25 μm/μs is spanned.</p>



<p>This speed should be compared to the lateral resolution of the microscope, which is for the  microscope used in this experiment around 0.4 μm FWHM (full width at half maximum of the point spread function). To scan over this resolution-limited spot, the resonant scanner needs 0.016 &#8211; 0.32 μs. For a pulsed laser with a repetition rate of 80 MHz with 12.5 ns between two pulses, this corresponds to 1.3 &#8211; 26 pulses per resolution-limited spot. Let&#8217;s call this number the <strong>cumulative pulse count per resolution-limited spot (CPC)</strong> from now on.</p>



<p>Intuitively, this means that each time a laser pulse tries to excite a fluorophore, this fluorophore has very recently already been hit by a number n of previous pulses, approximately n = CPC/2. If there is a chance that a pulse drives the fluorophore into a dark state that makes the fluorophore non-excitable for a handful of microseconds (e.g., a triplet state), then the CPC can be used to calculate the number of fluorophores remaining to be excited:</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center"><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=N_%7Bremaining%7D+%3D+N_0+%5Ccdot+e%5E%7B-CPC%2F%5Clambda%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" alt="N_{remaining} = N_0 &#92;cdot e^{-CPC/&#92;lambda}" class="latex" /></p>



<p>λ is a constant that depends on the applied laser intensity and the fluorophore itself. More concretely, the constant λ is the event rate of a fluorophore going into the dark state. The exponential decay with CPC should hold true as long as these events occur within a time window that is shorter than the recovery timescale of the dark state (for triplet states, this is ca. 1 μs). The main consequence is that the fluorescence yield is obviously proportional to the remaining number of excitable fluorophores, N<sub>remaining</sub>.</p>



<p>Therefore, if these events that generate dark triplet states were very unlikely (e.g., λ ~ 500), the effect of fast scanning would not really make a difference. However, if λ was ~1, the effects would be dramatic. How can we distinguish these scenarios?</p>



<p><strong>Experimental implementation, part I</strong></p>



<p>With a resonant scanning microscope, the experiment is easy to perform for a dye in a solution. You simply have to generate a homogeneous sample and image first with high zoom and low zoom, then compare the fluorescence in the central region where the scan speed is maximal.</p>



<p>Unfortunately, biological samples are not homogeneous, and also not stationary in the case of calcium indicators in living neurons. To image in a biological but still rather homogeneous sample, I used a transgenic GCaMP6f zebrafish line. I imaged in an explant of a dorsal forebrain region that I knew was labeled very densely and very homogeneously (described by <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41592-020-0759-2">Huang et al., 2020</a>). But the neuronal somata with the nice nuclear exclusion of GCaMP generated a lot of <strong>undesired variability</strong>.</p>



<p>The solution to circumvent these sources of variability is <strong>systematic averaging</strong>. In a first approach, I took advantage of the fact that I had written large parts of the <a href="https://gcamp6f.com/2016/12/01/matlab-code-for-instrument-control-of-a-resonant-scanning-microscope/">microscopy control software</a> myself. I wrote a helper program that performed continuous imaging but randomly moved the stage to different positions every few seconds, thereby averaging across all these inhomogeneously labeled FOVs:</p>

</div></figure>



<p>After a minute, the program automatically changed the Zoom setting to a different, random value and recorded again the video with intermittent stage movements:</p>

<p>To see an effect, I performed these experiments with rather high laser power (50-80 mW below the objective) and at rather low wavelengths (typically 800 nm, which had been used previously by Donnert et al.).</p>



<p>In the following plot, each data point corresponds to one movie as shown above. Keep in mind that a zoom setting corresponds to a specific CPC. For example, a zoom setting of 1 corresponds to a CPC of 1.3. However, I could not see any dependence of the total fluorescence on the cumulative pulse count CPC (left), so it was not worth determining a numeric value for λ. Interestingly, the total fluorescence decreased slightly but clearly visible over time (right), but since the zoom setting sequence was randomized, this did not reflect any dependence on the CPC:</p>

<p>This finding also held true for repetitions of the same experiment at different locations of the fish brain and with slightly changed wavelength or average power:</p>

<p>Next, I performed the same experiment with a different fluorophore. I injected OGB-1 into the homolog of piriform cortex of zebrafish. This is a large and relatively uniform region in the zebrafish forebrain that allows the dye to diffuse more or less homogeneously, at least if you&#8217;re lucky. When I analyzed the experiments, I found again no visible effect, no matter the laser power or the laser wavelength:</p>

<p>Together, these experiments strongly suggested that there is indeed no effect of triplet states and therefore no benefit of fast scanning to increase the fluorescence yield.</p>



<p><strong>Experimental implementation, part II</strong></p>



<p>However, to convince myself more about this experimental finding that seemed to be at odds with my expectations from the Donnert et al. paper, I used a second, slightly more direct approach. Instead of comparing sequential recordings at different zoom levels, I thought it would be interesting to record the fluorescence while changing the zoom level continuously. This would enable me to measure the dependence of fluorescence on CPC more quickly and therefore also for a larger set of power settings and wavelengths. To continuously change the zoom setting, I used a DAQ board to generate a low-frequency sine signal that modulated the zoom level from 1 (peak of the sine) to ~20 (trough of the sine) with a period of ca. 13 seconds. (To keep track of the sine signal, I also connected the command signal with the second input channel of the microscope.) That&#8217;s how these experiments looked like:</p>



<figure class="wp-block-video wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-videopress wp-embed-aspect-9-16 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">

</div></figure>



<p>Of course it is important to use not the entire FOV but only the central vertical stripe that remains more or less stationary. I used only a small vertical window of 7 pixels for the analysis. A single experiments resulted in a result such as shown below, plotting CPC (top) and fluorescence (bottom). The fluorescence clearly shows some variability stemming from active neurons (after all, we&#8217;re still dealing with a living brain here!):</p>

<p>In the plot above, no obvious relationship between CPC and fluorescence can be seen, and when I changed the power at 920 nm between 15 mW and 60 mW (this was the maximum that I could get with this system), I could not see any effect. I therefore show here all experiments performed at 920 nm, pooled across power settings and across two fish (total of ca. 30 recordings, each a few minutes):</p>

<p>For some experiments, the maximum zoom level was around 14, which I extended for a subset of experiments to something closer to 20.</p>



<p>I performed the same experiment also at 800 nm. I could also increase the laser power, simply because the laser provided more power at this wavelength range. However, these levels cannot go to arbitrary values. At a certain threshold that also depends on the duration of the exposure, all neurons across the zebrafish&#8217;s brain region become bright, resulting in a wave of high-calcium neurons that propagates through the brain. To avoid this, I used a maximum power of 75 mW at 800 nm. The result, again pooled across laser powers between 40 and 75 mW, showed an effect, albeit a bit subtle:</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large is-resized"><img loading="lazy" data-attachment-id="6879" data-permalink="https://gcamp6f.com/figure-2-01b/" data-orig-file="https://ptrrupprecht.files.wordpress.com/2021/07/figure-2-01b.png" data-orig-size="953,849" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="figure-2-01b" data-image-description="" data-image-caption="" data-medium-file="https://ptrrupprecht.files.wordpress.com/2021/07/figure-2-01b.png?w=300" data-large-file="https://ptrrupprecht.files.wordpress.com/2021/07/figure-2-01b.png?w=640" src="https://ptrrupprecht.files.wordpress.com/2021/07/figure-2-01b.png?w=953" alt="" class="wp-image-6879" width="343" height="304" srcset="https://ptrrupprecht.files.wordpress.com/2021/07/figure-2-01b.png?w=150 150w, https://ptrrupprecht.files.wordpress.com/2021/07/figure-2-01b.png?w=300 300w" sizes="(max-width: 343px) 100vw, 343px" /></figure></div>



<p>Fluorescence was indeed slightly higher for very low CPCs. However, the effect was much smaller than expected from experiments in vitro by Donnert et al.. Overall, such a small effect which, in addition, only appeared at the less relevant wavelength of 800 nm, seemed of little relevance for practical purposes.</p>



<p>Therefore, with fluorescence depending on CPC only in minor ways and under non-typical imaging conditions, the suggested triplet states seem to be not relevant for in vivo calcium imaging situations; and as a consequence, one would be ill-guided to assume that faster scanning yields higher fluorescence yield for two-photon microscopy by avoiding these μs-long dark states.</p>



<p>As a side-note, when I tried to analyze the power-dependency of this weak effect observed at 800 nm, I came across a weird effect. There was indeed some sort of increased fluorescence at lower zoom levels. However, this increase came with a delay of several seconds during the above experiments, resulting in a hysteresis:</p>

<p>Due to this longer time-scale, this effect has nothing to do with the short-lived μs-triplet states but is something different entirely. Photophysics is really complicated! This additional observation made me stop experiments, because I realized that these things would be more difficult to figure out, on top of a very small and probably irrelevant triplet effect.</p>



<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>



<p>I did not find any evidence for a substantial effect of triplet states during typical conditions (calcium imaging of neurons with a Ti:Sa laser and &lt;100 mW power at the sample).<strong> I therefore do not see a benefit in terms of fluorescence yield by faster scanning. </strong>The triplet states on the timescale of few microseconds that had been observed by Donnert et al. for fixed samples do not seem to play a major role under the investigated conditions. It is always challenging to convincingly show the absence of an effect, but my experimental results convinced me to not further investigate fast scanning and multiplexing schemes as a means to increase fluorescence yield.</p>



<p>Multiplexing or other modified distributions of excitation photons in time and space might still be able to increase fluorescence yield for certain fluorophores and conditions, but probably not under conditions similar to the ones I investigated.</p>



<p>The experiments described above are not fully systematic and cover only a specific parameter regime of excitation wavelengths, fluorophores and laser powers. However, anybody with a resonantly scanning two-photon microscope can easily reproduce these findings for any other scenario. <strong>Simply switch between high and low zoom settings and check whether the brightness in the center of the FOV changed substantially or not. </strong>Quantification of possible effects requires careful averaging, but a quick and qualitative confirmation or refutation of the above findings would be very easy to do for any experimenter.</p>

                <p>A coronavirus infection can mow down the forests of hairlike cilia that coat our airways, destroying a crucial barrier to keeping the virus from lodging deep in the lungs.</p>



<p>Normally, those cilia move in synchronized waves to push mucus out of the airway and into the throat. To protect the lungs, objects that don’t belong — <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coronavirus-covid19-infection-lung-cell-images">including viral invaders like the coronavirus</a> — get stuck in mucus, which is then swallowed (<em>SN: 9/15/20</em>).</p>



<p>But the coronavirus throws that system out of whack. When it infects respiratory tract cells, the virus appears to <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-021-24521-x">clear tracts of cilia</a>, and without the hairlike structures, the cells stop moving mucus, researchers report July 16 in <em>Nature Communications</em>.</p>

<p>That lack of cilia could help the virus invade the lungs and <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coronavirus-covid-19-critically-ill-patient-double-lung-transplant">cause severe COVID-19</a>, says Lisa Chakrabarti, a viral immunologist at the Pasteur Institute in Paris (<em>SN: 6/11/20</em>). Understanding how the coronavirus invades different parts of the body can help researchers find ways to block it.</p>



<p>Chakrabarti and colleagues infected lab-grown human cells that mimic the lining of the respiratory tract with the coronavirus. Images showed short, stubby cilia on the surface of the infected cells rather than the long projections found on healthy cells. When the team added microscopic beads to the surface of infected cells to measure mucus movement, those beads largely stayed still — a sign that the cells wouldn’t move mucus through the respiratory tract and into the throat to be swallowed. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

</div><figcaption>Normally, cilia move in synchronized waves to push mucus away from the lungs, toward the throat where foreign objects are swallowed. But coronavirus-infected cells lose those cilia and no longer push mucus, eliminating a barrier that would normally help prevent the virus from invading the lungs. Here microscopic beads move around the surface of uninfected lab-grown cells first and then around infected cells, illustrating mucus movement. The colored lines show how fast the beads are moving, with blue indicating slower speeds and red noting faster speeds.</figcaption></figure>



<p>Other viruses and bacteria can also damage the body’s ability to use mucus to trap and remove foreign invaders, Chakrabarti says. Some pathogens, like the coronavirus, just damage cilia, leaving the cells they protrude from intact. Other pathogens — like influenza — can kill ciliated cells. Respiratory syncytial virus, which typically causes colds, can do both: In adults, it destroys cilia; in children, it can kill the cells, which can be deadly. &nbsp;</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/nasa-perseverance-mars-rover-first-science-campaign-geology-life">NASA’s Perseverance Mars rover has begun its first science campaign</a></h4>

              
                <p>NASA’s Perseverance rover on Mars has seen its future, and it’s full of rocks. Lots and lots of rocks. After spending the summer trundling through Jezero Crater and checking out the sights, it’s now time for Percy to get to work, teasing out the geologic history of its new home and seeking out signs of ancient microbial life.</p>



<p>“We’ve actually been on a road trip,” project manager Jennifer Trosper, who is based at NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, Calif., said at a July 21 <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=66vjDLSt7kQ">news conference</a>. “And during it, we will take our very first sample from the surface of Mars.”</p>



<p>Percy is about 1 kilometer south of <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/mars-how-watch-nasa-perseverance-lander-touch-down">where it landed on February 18</a> (<em>SN: 2/17/21</em>). After driving itself around a region of sand dunes, accompanied by its <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/nasa-ingenuity-helicopter-mission-extended-mars-perseverance">tagalong helicopter Ingenuity</a> (<em>SN: 4/30/21</em>), the robotic explorer has pulled up to its first sampling spot: a garden of flat, pale stones dubbed paver stones. “This is the area where we are really going to be digging in, both figuratively and literally, to understand the rocks that we have been on for the last several months,” said Kenneth Farley, Perseverance project scientist at Caltech.</p>



<p>The team has been trying to figure out whether these rocks are volcanic or sedimentary. “We still don’t have the answer,” Farley said. Images taken a few centimeters above the surface show what the team is up against: The rocks are littered with dust and pebbles, probably blown in from elsewhere, and the smoother surfaces have a mysterious purplish coating. “All of these factors conspire to prevent us from peering into the rock and actually seeing what it is made out of,” he said.</p>





<p>In the coming weeks, Percy will bore a smooth cavity in one of those rocks and get below the surface crud. Instruments on its robotic arm will then move in close to produce detailed chemical and mineralogical maps that will reveal the rocks’ true nature. Then, sometime in mid-August, the team will extract its first sample. That sample will go into a tube that will eventually get dropped off — along with samples from other locales — <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/nasa-perseverance-rover-mars-instruments-life">for some future mission to pick up and bring to Earth</a> (<em>SN: 7/28/20</em>).</p>



<p>Cameras scouting farther afield have turned up future sampling sites. A small far-off hill shows hints of finely layered rock that may be mud deposits. “This is exactly the kind of rock that we are most interested in investigating for looking for potential biosignatures,” Farley said.</p>



<p>And the way that rocks are strewn about an ancient river delta in the distance suggests that the lake that once filled Jezero Crater went through multiple episodes of filling in and drying up. If true, Farley said, then the crater may have preserved “multiple time periods when we might be able to look for evidence of ancient life that might have existed on the planet.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/deep-sea-sponge-venus-flower-baskets-water-flow-fluid-dynamics">How intricate Venus’s-flower-baskets manipulate the flow of seawater</a></h4>

              
                <p>A Venus’s-flower-basket isn’t all show. This stunning deep-sea sponge can also alter the flow of seawater in surprising ways.</p>



<p>A lacy, barrel-shaped chamber forms the sponge’s glassy skeleton. Flow simulations reveal how this intricate structure <a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-021-03658-1">alters the way water moves around and through the sponge</a>, helping it endure unforgiving ocean currents and perhaps feed and reproduce, researchers report online July 21 in <em>Nature</em>.</p>



<p>Previous studies have found that the gridlike construction of a Venus’s-flower-basket (<em>Euplectella aspergillum</em>) is strong and flexible. “But no one has ever tried to see if these beautiful structures have fluid-dynamic properties,” says mechanical engineer Giacomo Falcucci of Tor Vergata University of Rome.</p>



<p>Harnessing supercomputers, Falcucci and colleagues simulated how water flows around and through the sponge’s body, with and without different skeletal components such as the sponge’s myriad pores. If the sponge were a solid cylinder, water flowing past would form a turbulent wake immediately downstream that could jostle the creature, Falcucci says. Instead water flows through and around the highly porous Venus’s-flower-basket and forms a gentle zone of water that flanks the sponge and displaces turbulence downstream, the team found. That way, the sponge’s body endures less stress.</p>





<p>Ridges that spiral around the outside of the sponge’s skeleton also somehow cause water to slow and swirl inside the structure, the simulations showed. As a result, food and reproductive cells that drift into the sponge would become trapped for up to twice as long as in the same sponge without ridges. That lingering could help the filter feeders catch more plankton. And because Venus’s-flower-baskets can reproduce sexually, it could also enhance the chances that free-floating sperm encounter eggs, the researchers say.</p>



<p>It’s amazing that such beauty could be so functional, Falcucci says. The sponge’s flow-altering abilities, he says, might help inspire taller, more wind-resistant skyscrapers.</p>

                <p><em>By </em><a href="http://emilyoliviareynolds.com/">Emily Reynolds</a></p>



<p>Having a &#8220;choice mindset&#8221; — believing, in short, that people’s behaviours are “choices”, or deliberate actions driven by their own motives and preferences — has multiple benefits. Those with a choice mindset feel as if they have control over their <a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2014-41019-032">own destiny</a>, for example, and see better outcomes in <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0749597817307197">negotiations</a>.</p>



<p>There are some drawbacks, however. Choice mindsets can lead to <a href="https://scholar.valpo.edu/fires/14/">victim blaming</a>, a lack of care about inequality, and a <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/0956797611407928">reduced interest</a> in acts of social good. A <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/19485506211016140?journalCode=sppa">new study</a> in <em>Social Psychological and Personality Science</em> takes a closer look at these more troublesome impacts. Yidan Yin from UC San Diego and colleagues find that people in positions of power tend to adopt a choice mindset, which makes them more likely to blame others for mistakes.</p>



<span id="more-42957"></span>



<p>In the first study, 363 participants completed two surveys in a random order. One measured participants’ sense of power, asking how much they agreed with statements such as “I can get others to do what I want”. The other looked at their tendency to apportion blame. Participants were told that the researchers were crowdsourcing a solution to a real issue in their department: whether or not to give a bonus to an administrative assistant who had failed to meet a deadline for a grant, and claimed she had no choice because she was “caught up in other work”. They were then asked how much choice the assistant had in not completing the work, and whether or not they believed she was to blame for missing the deadline. Finally, they were asked to vote on whether or not she should receive the bonus.</p>



<p>The team found that participants with a higher sense of power believed the assistant had more choice, and were less likely to vote to give her a bonus. Similarly, those who perceived the assistant to have more choice blamed her more. This remained the case even when excluding participants who did not believe the scenario was real.</p>



<p>In the second study, the team looked at what happened when people were made to feel more or less powerful. Participants were told they had been placed into teams to rank in order of importance a list of tips about how to succeed on Mechanical Turk (the crowdsourcing website&nbsp; where the study took place). In the low power condition, participants were told they had been assigned the role of a &#8220;worker&#8221; who was inferior to other teammates, while in the high power condition they were a supervisor.</p>



<p>Participants were then asked to summarise a transcription another team had supposedly made: the transcription was full of errors, which they were told was because the worker’s internet connection was unstable. They then answered questions about the transcription, indicating whether they believed the transcriber had a choice about correcting their errors, how much they were to blame, and whether they should receive payment for the transcription.</p>



<p>Again, participants in the high power group were both more likely to perceive the transcriber as having a choice than those in the low power group, which in turn made them more likely to blame and punish the transcriber by indicating they should not be paid. A third study also replicated these findings.</p>



<p>In all three studies, participants who felt more powerful were also more likely to see others as having more choice and, therefore, to blame them more when something went wrong — even if a reasonable explanation was given. As the team notes, this can’t just be because those in positions of power want to preserve their own position: in the first study, participants were asked to make a decision about someone completely unrelated to them and their own place in a social hierarchy. Instead, it may be that powerful people benefit psychologically from believing everyone’s position is related to choice, meaning they had reached their own position through merit and hard work.</p>



<p>Those in serious positions of power, such as policymakers and politicians, should therefore carefully consider how much choice people actually have in different situations. Are people “choosing” to remain on benefits, to use one issue highlighted by the team, or are they simply dealing with the constraints of their life and the world as best they can? If powerful people think more critically about when we really do have choice and when we don&#8217;t, it could avoid them unfairly blaming or punishing others.</p>



<p>&#8211; <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/19485506211016140?journalCode=sppa">Power Increases Perceptions of Others’ Choices, Leading People to Blame Others More</a></p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/space-exoplanet-century-astronomy-earth-universe">A century of astronomy revealed Earth’s place in the universe</a></h4>

              
                <p class="has-drop-cap" style="font-size:20px">A century ago, the Milky Way galaxy was the entirety of the known universe. We had no idea what made the stars shine, and only one star — our own sun — was known to harbor any planets. Of those planets, humans had explored only one: Earth.</p>



<p>“The stellar universe, as we know it … is a flattened, watch-shaped organization of stars and nebulae,” <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/sn-magazine/august-8-1921">astronomer Harlow Shapley wrote in <em>Science News Bulletin</em></a>, the earliest version of <em>Science News</em>, in August 1921 (<em>SN: 8/8/1921, p. 3</em>). That sparkling pocket watch was the Milky Way, and at the time Shapley wrote this, astronomers were just beginning to conceive that anything at all might lie beyond it.</p>



<p>Today, spacecraft have flown by every one of the solar system’s planets, taking close-ups of their wildly alien faces. The solar system, it turns out, contains a cornucopia of small rocky and icy bodies that have challenged the very definition of a planet. Thousands of planets have been spotted orbiting other stars, some of which may have the right conditions for life to thrive. And the Milky Way, we now know, is just one of billions of galaxies.</p>

<p>The last 100 years have brought a series of revolutions in astronomy, each one kicking Earth a bit farther from the center of things. Along the way, people have not exactly been receptive to these blows to our home planet’s centrality. In 1920, the question of whether there could be other “island universes” — galaxies — was the subject of the Great Debate between two astronomers. In the 1970s, when Mars was shown to have a pink sky, not blue, reporters booed. Their reaction “reflects our wish for Mars to be just like the Earth,” said astronomer Carl Sagan afterward. And in the 1990s, astronomers almost missed extrasolar planets hiding in their data because they had tailored their search techniques to find planets more like those in our own solar system.</p>



<p>But turning our focus from Earth has opened our minds to new possibilities, new universes, new places where life might exist. The next century of astronomy could bring better views of our cosmic origins and new strategies for finding worlds that other creatures call home.</p>



<p>The misperceptions of decades past suggest scientists should be careful when predicting just what we’ll find in the future.</p>



<p>“You learn a lot of humility in this business,” says planetary scientist Candice Hansen of the Planetary Science Institute, based in Tucson. “You always learn a lot more when you’re wrong than when you’re right.”</p>





<h4>More than the Milky Way</h4>



<p>At the turn of the 20th century, conventional wisdom held that the Milky Way stood alone. It contained stars, sometimes organized in clusters, and fuzzy patches of light known as nebulae. That was about it.</p>



<p>Some nebulae had spiral structures, “appearing in the telescope like vast Fourth-of-July pinwheels,” as <em>Science News Letter</em>, the predecessor of <em>Science News</em>, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/sky-pinwheels-are-stellar-universes-6000000000000000000-miles-away">described them in 1924</a>. In the 18th century, German philosopher Immanuel Kant had described nebulae as “higher universes,” or, “so to speak, Milky Ways.” But by the early 1900s, most astronomers thought that drawing that parallel was ridiculous.</p>



<p>“No competent thinker,” wrote historian of astronomy Agnes Clerke in 1890, can “maintain any single nebula to be a star system of coordinate rank with the Milky Way.”</p>



<p>By the 1920s, though, that view was already being challenged. As early as 1914, astronomer Heber Curtis of Lick Observatory in California argued that spiral nebulae are not part of the Milky Way, but rather “inconceivably distant galaxies of stars or separate stellar universes so remote that an entire galaxy becomes but an unresolved haze of light.”</p>



<p>Around the same time, Shapley, of Mount Wilson Observatory in California, began to prove that the Milky Way itself was inconceivably vast.</p>



<p>Shapley built on work by Henrietta Leavitt, one of a group of women “computers” at Harvard University who pored over photographic plates capturing the night sky. In studying photographs of the Magellanic Clouds, which we now know are two small galaxies that orbit the Milky Way, Leavitt noticed that certain stars varied in brightness over time, some of them in a peculiar way. “It is worthy of notice,” she wrote in 1908, that “the brighter variables have the longer periods.” In other words, brighter stars twinkled more slowly.</p>

<p>That meant that these variable stars, called <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/blinking-stars-show-size-universe">Cepheids, could be used to estimate cosmic distances</a>. It’s hard to tell how far away a cosmic object truly is — bright-looking stars could be intrinsically dim but close, while faint-looking stars could be intrinsically bright but distant. But all the Cepheids within the same cloud should be roughly the same distance from Earth. That meant “their periods are apparently associated with their actual emission of light,” Leavitt wrote in 1912. To figure out any Cepheid’s true brightness, all an astronomer had to do was measure its twinkling speed. It was a short step from there to figuring out its distance.</p>



<p>Shapley put this fact to use just a few years later, measuring distances to Cepheids within globular clusters of stars to figure out the sun’s position in the Milky Way. To his surprise, the sun was not in the center of the galaxy but off to one side. The Milky Way’s starry disk was also about 10 times wider than previous astronomers had assumed: about 300,000 light-years across, according to his calculations. (He overshot a bit; modern astronomers think it’s somewhere between 120,000 and 200,000 light-years.)</p>



<p>He and Curtis took their opposing views to the public at a meeting of the National Academy of Sciences in Washington, D.C., in April 1920, in an event that became known as <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/astronomy-great-debate-island-universe-milky-way">the Great Debate</a>. Each had 40 minutes to present their views on whether there is only one or several universes — what we now think of as galaxies.</p>



<p>Shapley, who was in his 30s and considered a rising star in the field, went first. A former journalist who reportedly was uncomfortable speaking to crowds, he read his argument from a typewritten script. He barely touched on the question of other universes, focusing instead on his new measurements of the Milky Way’s size. The implication was that the Milky Way was too large for other galaxies to make sense.</p>



<p>Curtis was an older, well-respected authority on spiral nebulae, as well as a gifted speaker. He argued for the then-standard view that the Milky Way was much smaller than Shapley supposed. But even a large Milky Way shouldn’t negate the possibility of other, equally large galaxies, he argued. The spectra of light coming from spiral nebulae was similar enough to that of the Milky Way that they could be similar objects, he maintained.</p>



<p>Both astronomers were partly right, and partly wrong.</p>



<h4>Galaxies come into view</h4>



<p>The Great Debate was resolved by a young astronomer named Edwin Hubble working at Mount Wilson. Hubble also used Leavitt’s Cepheid variable technique to measure cosmic distances, this time by finding the variable stars in the spiral nebulae themselves.</p>



<p>Hubble started observing the Andromeda nebula, one of the brightest nebulae on the sky, in the fall of 1923. He used Mount Wilson’s 60-inch telescope and its 100-inch telescope, then the world’s largest. Over the next year or so, he studied 35 Cepheids in Andromeda and a different nebula called Triangulum. Their periods were long enough that the nebulae had to be on the order of a million light-years away for the stars to appear so faint. (We now know it’s more like 2.5 million light-years to Andromeda and 2.7 million to Triangulum.)</p>

<p>“Measuring the distance to Andromeda was a big deal because it was the first evidence that there are galaxies beyond our own,” says astronomer Emily Levesque of the University of Washington in Seattle. “It changed what we thought of as the shape of our universe.”</p>



<p>A few hints that the Milky Way was not alone had cropped up before that, but <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/universe-expands-when-astronomer-discovers-other-stellar-systems">Hubble’s finding clinched it</a>. Even if the Milky Way was as big as Shapley claimed, Andromeda lay outside its borders. When Shapley received Hubble’s paper, he reportedly said, “Here is the letter that destroyed my universe.”</p>



<p><em>Science News Letter</em> reported Hubble’s finding under the headline “<a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/sky-pinwheels-are-stellar-universes-6000000000000000000-miles-away">Sky Pinwheels Are Stellar Universes 6,000,000,000,000,000,000 Miles Away</a>” in December 1924 (<em>SN: 12/6/24, p. 2</em>).</p>



<p>“It seems probable that many of the smaller spiral nebulae are still more remote and appear smaller on this account,” the story quotes Hubble as saying. “The portion of the universe within the range of our investigation consists of vast numbers of stellar galaxies comparable to our own, scattered about through nearly empty space and separated from one another by distances of inconceivable magnitude.” Here at last was the modern view of the universe.</p>



<p>By the end of the decade, Hubble had not only shown that the spiral nebulae were “island universes,” he also had begun to classify different galaxy types and think about how they evolved over time. What’s more, he showed that galaxies <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/nebulae-hold-skys-speed-record">were flying away from each other</a> at speeds proportional to their distance. In other words, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/scientist-says-universe-actually-exploding">the universe was expanding</a>.</p>



<p>By the end of the century, astronomers knew that the universe was dotted with billions of galaxies of all shapes and sizes. In April 1990, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/antenna-jam-delays-hubbles-first-light">NASA launched</a> the <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/space-telescope-saga-setbacks">first optical space telescope</a> into Earth’s orbit, giving the world a <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/hubble-finally-has-stars-its-eyes">new perspective on space</a>.</p>



<p>“Instead of these blurry blobs from even the best mountaintop observatories on our planet,” says planetary scientist Jim Bell of Arizona State University in Tempe, “all of a sudden the entire realm of solar system, galaxy, extragalactic … was opened up by getting above the atmosphere.”</p>



<p>NASA named the telescope after the scientist who opened astronomers’ minds to the existence of such a universe: the Hubble Space Telescope.</p>



<p>The <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/astronomers-celebrating-hubbles-past-focus-its-future">images it has captured over 30 years</a> of operations — star clusters, galaxies and nebulae — are so iconic they are printed on everything from socks and coffee mugs to high fashion runway designs. The telescope itself was recently immortalized in Lego form.</p>



<p>“It’s the one that literally everyone has heard of,” says Levesque. Most people today think Hubble was “the guy who built the telescope.”</p>



<p>One image from early on in the space telescope’s tenure stands out. In December 1995, the telescope’s director, Robert Williams, decided to train the observatory on a tiny, dark patch of sky near the handle of the Big Dipper for 10 consecutive days. The resulting portrait of this featureless bit of sky revealed <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/hubbles-deep-view-universe">thousands of previously unknown galaxies</a> sending their light from farther away than astronomers had ever seen before (<em>SN: 1/20/96, p. 36</em>). The universe as Edwin Hubble had imagined it, chock-full of island universes, was captured in one hard look.</p>



<p>As for Henrietta Leavitt, she missed out on the recognition she deserved for helping knock the Milky Way from its central perch. A Swedish mathematician wrote to her in 1925 saying that her work “has impressed me so deeply that I feel seriously inclined to nominate you to the Nobel Prize in physics for 1926.” He received a reply from Shapley, by then director of the Harvard College Observatory: Leavitt had died four years earlier.</p>

<h3>Bizarre beauties</h3>



<p>In the 1960s, astronomer Halton Arp proposed that researchers use the weirdest-looking galaxies as natural experiments to learn what gives a galaxy its shape. To help researchers figure out what makes a galaxy spiral, blobby or some other shape, Arp published the 1966 <em>Atlas of Peculiar Galaxies</em>, a compilation of 338 galaxies sorted by appearance.</p>



<p>Arp’s categories were spiral, elliptical, neither spiral nor elliptical, double and none of the above. At the time, some of the galaxies had no names or designations, and are still best known by their Arp numbers, like Arp 273 and Arp 147.</p>



<p>Despite their diversity, most of the peculiar galaxies are now thought to be going through a merger or interacting with another galaxy. But Arp never bought that explanation. He claimed for years that galaxies’ shapes come from material ejected from their luminous cores. Here are six of the most beautiful and bizarre galaxies, as seen by the Hubble Space Telescope and others, which offer much greater detail than Arp had access to half a century ago. — <em>Lisa Grossman</em></p>

<h4>Steps to Mars</h4>



<p>The first liquid-fueled rockets, precursors to the ones that later carried robots and people into space, launched in the 1920s. A century later, robots have flown past, orbited or landed on every planetary body that was known in 1920, and a few that weren’t. People have <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/moon">walked on the moon</a> and have <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/nasa-twins-study-reveals-effects-space-scott-kelly-health">lived in space</a> for more than a year at a time. And serious talks about sending people to Mars are in the works.</p>



<p>NASA used to explore other worlds in a clear order, first observing with telescopes and then carrying out increasingly complex missions: flybys, orbiters, landers, rovers, then people and sample returns. “We’ve taken that entire progression on the moon, in [the last] century,” Bell says. “Sometime in this new century, we’ll add Mars to that list. All the rest of the solar system, we’ve got large chunks of that matrix checked off.”</p>



<p>After the Soviet Union <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/compare-moon-programs">launched the first artificial satellite, Sputnik 1, in 1957</a>, space launches came fast and furious. Many were demonstrations of political and military might. But a lot of them had scientific merit, too. The Soviet Luna 3 spacecraft <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/1959-science-review">photographed the farside of the moon</a> in 1959 — shortly after NASA’s founding. Spacecraft flew past <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/still-mystery">Venus</a> and <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/mars-closer-look-nearby-world">Mars</a> in the 1960s, sending back the first closeup data on their alien atmospheres and surfaces.</p>



<p>That same decade, humans <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/moon">landed on the moon</a> and<a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/ancient-moon-samples-exhilarate-selenologists"> brought back rocks</a>, opening a wide and detailed window into the history of the solar system. The <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/nasa-apollo-anniversary-moon-rocks-preservation">lunar samples from the Apollo missions</a> gave scientists a way to figure out how old planetary surfaces are around the solar system, taught us that the entire inner solar system was bombarded with impacts in its youth and gave us an origin story for the moon (<em>SN: 7/6/19 &amp; 7/20/19, p. 18</em>).</p>



<p>“Until we started the space program, we really had no idea what the geology was on other places,” says Hansen of the Planetary Science Institute. “Early in the century, they were still debating whether the craters on the moon were impact craters or volcanic calderas. Even right there in our own backyard, we didn’t know what was going on.”</p>



<p>And extraterrestrial geology was surprising. Without meaning to, planetary scientists had based a lot of their expectations for other worlds on the Earth. The <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/sn-magazine/june-5-1976">cover of <em>Science News</em> from June 1976</a>, the month before NASA’s Viking 1 lander became the first long-lived spacecraft to land softly on Mars, showed Mars with a Cheez Whiz–colored desert under a clear blue sky. In the sleep-deprived rush to release the first color images sent back by Viking 1, scientists processed the image to produce a blue sky there, too.</p>

Mars’ sky is actually a dusty yellowish-pink.</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>But the day after the landing, James Pollack of the imaging team told reporters that the <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/week-mars">Martian sky was actually pink</a>, probably thanks to scattered light from dust particles suspended in the air.</p>



<p>“When we found the sky of Mars to be a kind of pinkish-yellow rather than the blue which had erroneously first been reported, the announcement was greeted by a chorus of good-natured boos from the assembled reporters,” Sagan later wrote in the introduction to his popular book <em>Cosmos</em>. “They wanted Mars to be, even in this respect, like the Earth.”</p>



<p>Still, the Viking 1 and 2 landings brought Mars down to Earth, so to speak. “Mars had become a place,” Viking project scientist Gerald Soffen said in an interview for a NASA historical project published in 1984. “It went from a word, an abstract thought, to a real place.”</p>



<p>In some ways, the Viking landers’ views of Mars were disappointing. The mission’s central goal was explicitly to search for microbial life. It was “a long shot,” journalist Janet L. Hopson wrote <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/martian-life-odds-and-oddities">in <em>Science News</em> in June 1976</a> (<em>SN: 6/5/76, p. 374</em>). But “even if no signs of life appear, [biologists] stand to gain their first real perspective on terrestrial biochemistry, life origins and evolution.”</p>



<p>The results of the Viking mission’s life-detection experiments were inconclusive, a finding almost worse than a true negative.</p>



<p>NASA subsequently pulled back from seeking life directly. The next 45 years of Mars missions searched for signs of past water, potentially habitable environments and organic molecules, instead of living organisms. All of those features turned up in data from the <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/mars-rover-spirit-still-running-only-place">Spirit</a>, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/nasa-mars-opportunity-rover-dead">Opportunity</a> and <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/nasa-curiosity-mars-rover-weighed-mountain-its-climbing">Curiosity</a> rovers in the 2000s and 2010s.</p>



<p>Now, NASA’s <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/mars-how-watch-nasa-perseverance-lander-touch-down">Perseverance rover</a>, which landed in February 2021, is hunting for <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/nasa-perseverance-rover-mars-instruments-life">signs of ancient microbial life</a>. The rover will cache rock samples that a future mission will bring back to Earth. And the joint Russian and European space agencies’ ExoMars rover — named Rosalind Franklin, after the chemist whose work was central to discovering DNA’s structure — aims to seek molecular signatures of life on Mars and just below the surface after it launches in 2022.</p>



<p>Sagan predicted in 1973 that if he had been born 50 years in the future, the search for life on Mars would have already been completed. Today, 48 years later, we’re still looking.</p>

<h4>Exotic moons</h4>



<p>The year after the Vikings landed on Mars, another pair of spacecraft launched to check almost the entire rest of the solar system off scientists’ must-see list. Astronomers realized that in 1977, the planets would line up in such a way that a spacecraft launched that year could reach Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune one by one, stealing a little angular momentum from each world as it went along. The mission was <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/voyager-hard-start-long-road">dubbed Voyager</a> (<em>SN: 8/27/77, p. 132</em>).</p>



<p>“There’s never been anything like it, and there never will be again,” says Bell, of Arizona State. “It was comparable to the voyages of Magellan or Darwin or Lewis and Clark. Just an absolutely profound mission of discovery that completely changed the landscape of planetary science in this century.”</p>



<p>Voyager’s views of the outer solar system forced scientists to think outside of the “Earth box,” says Hansen, who worked on the mission. “The Voyager imaging team, bless their hearts, they would make predictions and then they’d be wrong,” she says. “And we would learn something.”</p>



<p>Hansen recalls chatting with a member of the imaging team when the spacecraft was approaching Jupiter and its dozens of moons. “He said, ‘Candy, we will see craters on [moons] Io and Europa, because we know from the density that those are rocky worlds. But not on Ganymede and Callisto, because those are ice,’ ” she recalls. Instead, the images showed Ganymede and Callisto were covered in craters. “That was an aha moment — ice is going to act like rock at those temperatures.” Meanwhile, ocean-swathed Europa and molten Io had almost no craters.</p>



<p>The moons of Jupiter presented “a whole, previously unimagined family of exotic worlds, each radically different not only from its companions, but also from everything else in the planet-watcher’s experience,” journalist Jonathan Eberhart wrote in <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/io-charting-fire"><em>Science News</em> in April 1980</a> (<em>SN: 4/19/80, p. 251</em>).</p>



<p>Before 1979, Earth was the only geologically active, rocky world scientists knew about. But Voyager changed that view, too. A member of Voyager’s optical navigation team, Linda Morabito, spotted an odd, mushroom-shaped feature extending off the edge of Io while she was trying to plot the spacecraft’s position on March 9, 1979. She consulted with the science team, and they soon realized they were looking at a gigantic volcanic plume. <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/io-charting-fire">Io was erupting</a> in real time.</p>



<p>Three planetary scientists had predicted Io’s fire before the plumes were discovered. The three suggested the moon was heated by a gravitational tug-of-war between Jupiter and one or two of its other moons, Europa and Ganymede.</p>



<p>But most of the planetary science community was stunned. “We take gravity for granted here. It keeps our feet on the ground,” Hansen says. “But gravity molds and shapes so many things in so many unexpected ways.”</p>



<p>Voyager and subsequent missions to the outer planets, like <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/close-encounter-galileo-eyes-io">Galileo at Jupiter</a> in the 1990s and <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/saturns-rings-panoramic-perspective">Cassini at Saturn</a> in the 2000s, transformed our view of the solar system in another profound way. They revealed several surprising parts of the solar system where life might exist today.</p>



<p>Voyager hinted that Europa might have a liquid water ocean beneath an icy shell. Galileo strengthened that idea, and suggested the ocean might be salty and have contact with the moon’s rocky core, which could provide chemical nutrients for microbial life. NASA is now developing a mission to fly past Europa. “I will not be surprised if life is somehow discovered on Europa in my lifetime, or in this century,” Bell says.</p>

<p>Shortly after the Cassini spacecraft arrived at Saturn in 2004, scientists realized that the tiny moon Enceladus <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/whole-enceladus">vents dramatic plumes</a> of water vapor, dust and ice crystals into space from a hidden subsurface sea. That moon also looks like a good place for life.</p>



<p>If the last century of exploring the solar system was about coming to grips with alien geology, Hansen says, this coming century is going to be about oceanography — getting a grip on the strange seas in our own solar system.</p>



<p>“I think that’s going to shape a lot of the research going forward,” Hansen says. Now that it’s clear these moons have oceans, researchers will ask if they are habitable, and eventually, if they are inhabited.</p>



<h4>Exoplanets detected</h4>



<p>The first planet spotted outside our solar system — an exoplanet — was so different from anything in our solar system that astronomers weren’t hunting for anything like it.</p>



<p>“Knowing that there are actually planets around other stars now seems so trivial to say,” says exoplanet observer Debra Fischer of Yale University. “But we had arguments in 1995 about whether other stars have planets.”</p>



<p>So when astronomer Michel Mayor of the Geneva Observatory turned his spectrograph on the sky in April 1994, he kept quiet about his hopes of finding true exoplanets. He was more likely to find brown dwarfs, failed stars that never grew massive enough to burn hydrogen.</p>



<p>His instrument used a clever new way to hunt for other worlds, called the radial velocity technique. Previous exoplanet hunters had looked directly for a star’s motion in response to the gravity of an orbiting planet, watching to see if the star would move back and forth in the sky. That technique had led to several planetary claims, even dating back to 1855, but none of them had held up. Those motions are tiny; Jupiter’s influence moves the sun by just 12 meters per second.</p>



<div class="wp-block-sciencenews-content-sidebar alignwide">
<h3>Exoplanet detections</h3>



<p>Astronomers have hunted exoplanets with several techniques, some better than others. The earliest claimed exoplanet detections used the astrometry method, but almost none of them held up. Success came with the radial velocity method in the 1990s. But the transit method has proved most prolific. </p>

</div>



<p>Instead, Mayor and others studied a shift in the wavelength of starlight as a star moved to and fro. As a star approaches us, the light shifts to shorter, or bluer, wavelengths; as it moves away, the light grows redder. Calculating the velocity of a star’s back-and-forth motion, astronomers could figure out the minimum mass and length of the year of whatever was tugging that star.</p>



<p>The shifts Mayor was looking for were still minuscule. The search was considered futile, and fringe — like looking for little green men. So astronomers who explicitly claimed to be searching for planets had a hard time scheduling observations at telescopes. Brown dwarfs, on the other hand, were considered legitimate science, and would be easier to detect.</p>



<p>So the world was astounded when, in October 1995, Mayor and his student Didier Queloz reported strong evidence not of a brown dwarf, but of <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/finding-planets-around-ordinary-stars">a true planet orbiting the sunlike star 51 Pegasi</a>, about 50 light-years from our solar system.</p>



<p>The new planet was weird. It seemed to be about half the mass of Jupiter, too puny to be a brown dwarf. But it orbited the star once every 4.23 Earth days, putting it incredibly close to its star. There’s nothing like that in our solar system, and astronomers had no idea how it could exist.</p>



<p>“The news flashed through the astronomical community like a lightning bolt,” wrote journalist Ron Cowen in <em>Science News</em>, in the <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/finding-planets-around-ordinary-stars">first</a> of <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/searching-other-worlds">three</a> <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/extrasolar-planets-emerge-dark">stories</a> on the new planet he would write within a month (<em>SN: 10/21/95, p. 260</em>).</p>



<p>51 Peg b, as it came to be known, launched a new era. “It means planets exist around other sunlike stars, we can find them, and they might be the exciting ones,” says Yale anthropologist Lisa Messeri, who has studied how astronomers create worlds out of pixels and spectra. “Firsts are exciting because they promise there will be seconds and thirds and fourths.”</p>



<div class="wp-block-sciencenews-content-sidebar">
<h3>Big surprise&nbsp;</h3>



<p>The first planet found orbiting a star similar to our sun fit nobody’s mold. Dubbed a “hot Jupiter,” 51 Pegasi b is bigger than Jupiter, but 20 times closer to its star than Earth is to the sun (Earth is one astronomical unit, AU, or 150 million kilometers from the sun). 51 Pegasi b circles its star in four days; Earth’s orbit is a lengthier 365 days.</p>

</div>



<p>The search was on. A group from San Francisco quickly found two more planets hiding in data the researchers hadn’t finished analyzing yet. Those next two planets, 70 Vir b and 47 UMa b, were also more massive and closer to their stars than expected.</p>



<p>The existence of these three worlds, which were named hot Jupiters because their close-in orbits should make them sizzle, upended the paradigm for what a planet could be like. Clearly, our solar system was not the template for the universe.</p>



<p>Yet for a few years after 51 Peg b was announced, astronomers debated whether the planet was really there. Maybe the star’s apparent back-and-forth was just its outer atmosphere breathing in and out. Those debates waned as more planets were discovered, but it took a new technique to really convince everyone.</p>



<p>Astronomers had predicted at least back to the 1850s that some planets would pass in front of their stars from the perspective of Earth. As it crossed, or transited, the face of its star, a planet could reveal its presence by blocking a little bit of the star’s light.</p>



<p>But if other solar systems are like ours, transits would be incredibly difficult to detect. Our planets are too small and too far from the sun to cast a large shadow. Hot Jupiters, on the other hand, should block way more of a star’s light than any planets in our solar system. With the discovery of 51 Peg b, transits seemed not only possible to detect, but almost easy.</p>



<p>The first transiting extrasolar planet revealed itself in 1999, when then-Harvard graduate student David Charbonneau drove to Colorado to do his thesis work with astronomer Tim Brown. Brown had built a tiny telescope on a friend’s farm north of Boulder, setting up the computers in a repurposed turkey coop, to search for transiting planets. By the time Charbonneau arrived, however, the farm had been sold and the telescope relocated to a lab site.</p>



<p>To practice the technique, Charbonneau aimed Brown’s telescope at a star, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/extrasolar-planets-out-shadows">called HD 209458</a>, that already had a suspected planet. The star’s light dimmed by about 1 percent, and then it shone bright again. That was a clear sign of a planet about 32 percent wider than Jupiter.</p>



<p>That discovery ended all doubts about the existence of exoplanets, says Fischer, who had worked with the exoplanet-hunting group in San Francisco. “It happened like that,” Fischer says, with a finger snap. The combined size and mass of the planet unambiguously ruled out brown dwarfs or other exotic explanations. “It walks like a Jupiter, talks like a Jupiter, it’s a Jupiter.”</p>



<p>There was another advantage to the transit method: It can show the <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/craft-probes-alien-planets-atmosphere">composition of a planet’s atmosphere</a>. Planets detected by the wobble technique were “little more than phantoms,” Cowen wrote in <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/passages"><em>Science News</em> in 2007</a>. They were too small to be seen, and too close to the star to be photographed directly.</p>



<p>“Everyone had assumed that if you wanted to [detect] the atmosphere of an extrasolar planet, you’d have to image it,” Charbonneau told <em>Science News</em>. But starlight filtering through a transiting planet’s sky could reveal what gases surround the alien world without the need for a snapshot.</p>



<h4>Hunt for habitable planets</h4>



<p>Transits soon overtook wobbles as the most fruitful planet-finding strategy. That was mostly thanks to the launch of NASA’s <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/kepler-space-telescope-finds-its-first-extrasolar-planets">Kepler space telescope</a> in March 2009.</p>



<p>Kepler’s mission was explicitly about <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/searching-superearths">finding other Earths</a>. For nearly four years, the telescope stared at 170,000 stars in a single patch of sky to catch as many transiting planets as it could. In particular, its operators were hoping for Earth-sized planets in Earthlike orbits around sunlike stars — places where <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/hunt-habitable-planets">life could conceivably exist</a>.</p>



<p>The years that followed were a boom time for planet finders. By the end of its nearly 10-year run, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/planet-hunting-kepler-space-telescope-dead">Kepler had confirmed almost 2,700 planets</a> and thousands more potential planets. Findings went beyond the hot Jupiters to worlds the size of Earth and planets in the “habitable zone,” where temperatures could be right for liquid water.</p>



<p>Discoveries came so quickly that a single new world stopped being a news story. Kepler’s data shifted from revealing new worlds one by one to taking an exoplanet census. It showed that hot Jupiters are not actually the most common type of planet; they were just the easiest ones to spot. The most common type makes no appearance in our solar system: <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/kepler-exoplanets-habitable-earth-neptune">worlds between the size of Earth and Neptune</a>, which may be rocky super-Earths or gaseous mini-Neptunes.</p>



<p>And Kepler revealed that there are more planets in the galaxy than stars. Every one of the billions and billions of stars in the Milky Way should have at least one world in its orbit.</p>



<p>But the telescope never really achieved the goal of finding another Earth. Kepler required three transits to confirm a world’s existence. That means the telescope had to stare for at least three years to find a planet orbiting at Earth’s exact distance.</p>



<p>By 2013, after four years of observing, half of Kepler’s stabilizing reaction wheels had failed. The telescope couldn’t maintain its unblinking view of the same part of the sky. Mission scientists cleverly reprogrammed the telescope to look at other stars for shorter spans of time. But most of the planets found there orbited closer to their stars than Earth does, meaning they couldn’t be Earth twins.</p>



<p>Finally, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/planet-hunting-kepler-space-telescope-dead">Kepler ran out of fuel in 2018</a>, with no true Earth analog in sight.</p>



<p>Messeri recalls an exoplanet conference at MIT in 2011 where a lot of the conversation was about finding a twin of Earth.</p>



<p>“It was a peak of excitement — maybe we’re going to find this planet in the next three years, or five years. It felt close,” she says. “What’s interesting is, in the 10 years since then, it still feels that close.”</p>



<p>But astronomers had already realized they might not need a true Earth analog to find a planet where life could exist. Rocky worlds orbiting smaller, dimmer stars than the sun are easier to find, and might be just as friendly to life.</p>



<p>Charbonneau again was ahead of the curve, having started a program called MEarth in 2008 to hunt for habitable planets around puny M dwarf stars using eight small telescopes in Arizona (plus another eight in Chile that were added in 2014). Within six months, Charbonneau and colleagues had <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/distant-planet-exotic-water-world">found a super-Earth dubbed GJ 1214b</a> that is probably a water world — maybe a bit too wet for life.</p>



<p>The European Southern Observatory started the TRAPPIST, for TRAnsiting Planets and PlanetesImals Small Telescope, survey from La Silla, Chile, in 2010. Another telescope, at Oukaïmeden Observatory in Morocco, came online to search for planets orbiting Northern Hemisphere stars in 2016. Among that survey’s discoveries is the <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/seven-earth-sized-planets-orbit-nearby-supercool-star">TRAPPIST-1 system</a> of seven Earth-sized planets orbiting a single M dwarf star, three of which might be in the habitable zone (<em>SN: 3/18/17, p. 6</em>).</p>

At least three of the planets could have temperatures that are good for life.</span><span class="credit wp-credit-3101682">JPL-Caltech/NASA</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>NASA’s successor to Kepler, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/launch-tess-nasa-boost-search-exoplanets">TESS</a>, or Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite, has been scanning the entire sky since April 2018 for small planets orbiting bright nearby stars, including M dwarfs. It spotted more than 2,200 potential planets in its<a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/tess-space-telescope-has-spotted-its-first-exoplanet"> first full-sky scan</a>, scientists announced in March 2021.</p>



<p>These days, astronomers are joining up with scientists across disciplines, from planetary scientists who study hypothetical exoplanet geology to microbiologists and chemists who think about what kinds of aliens could live on those planets and how to detect those life-forms. That’s a big shift from even 10 years ago, Messeri says. In the early 2010s, no one was talking about life.</p>



<p>“You weren’t allowed to say that,” she says. “Astronomers would whisper it to me during fieldwork, but this was not a search for aliens.”</p>



<p>Exoplanet astronomy is on firmer ground now. Its leading figures have won MacArthur “genius” grants. Pioneer planet finders Mayor and Queloz <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/physics-nobel-2019-early-universe-cosmic-microwave-exoplanets">won the 2019 Nobel Prize in physics</a>. The work is no longer hidden away in conferences that are actually about stars. “It doesn’t have to legitimize itself anymore,” Messeri says. “It’s a real science.”</p>



<p>The promise that transiting planets can reveal the contents of their alien atmospheres may soon be fulfilled. NASA’s <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/new-telescopes-will-search-signs-life-distant-planets">James Webb Space Telescope</a> may launch this year, after many years of delays. One of its first tasks will be to probe the atmospheres of transiting planets, including those of TRAPPIST-1.</p>



<p>If anything is alive on those absolutely alien, unearthly worlds, maybe the next century will bring it to light.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/xerxes-blue-butterfly-first-human-caused-us-insect-extinction">This butterfly is the first U.S. insect known to go extinct because of people</a></h4>

              
                <p>It’s been roughly 80 years since the Xerces blue butterfly was last spotted flitting about on pastel wings across coastal California sand dunes. But scientists are still learning about the insect.</p>



<p>New research on DNA from a nearly century-old museum specimen shows that the butterfly was a distinct species. That finding means that the Xerces blue butterfly (<em>Glaucopsyche xerces</em>) is <a href="https://doi.org/10.1098/rsbl.2021.0123">the first U.S. insect species that scientists recognized went extinct because of humans</a>, researchers report July 21 in <em>Biology Letters</em>. There are insects that went extinct earlier, like the Rocky Mountain locust (<em>Melanoplus spretus</em>), that scientists have strong suspicions that humans were to blame for the extinction. But for this butterfly, there was no question at the time.</p>



<p>The butterfly used to live only on the San Francisco Peninsula. But by the early 1940s, less than a century after its formal scientific description in the 1850s, the gossamer-winged butterfly had vanished. Its rapid disappearance is attributed to the loss of habitat and native plant food as a result of urban development and, possibly, an influx of invasive ants likely spread though the shipment of goods.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But it’s long been unclear if the Xerces blue butterfly was its own species, or simply an isolated population of another, more widespread species of blue butterfly, says Corrie Moreau, an entomologist at Cornell University.</p>



<p>To find out, Moreau and colleagues turned to a 93-year-old Xerces specimen housed at Chicago’s Field Museum, extracting DNA from a tiny bit of the insect’s tissue. Despite the DNA being degraded from age, the team could compare selected Xerces genes with those of other closely related blue butterflies. The researchers also compared the genomes, or genetic instruction books, of the insects’ mitochondria — cellular structures involved in energy production that have their own set of DNA.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Using the genes and the “mitogenomes,” the researchers crafted an evolutionary tree, showing how all of the butterfly species are related to each other. The extinct Xerces blue butterfly was genetically distinct, thus warranting classification as a species, the team found.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“We sort of lost a piece of the biodiversity puzzle that made up the tapestry of the San Francisco Bay area when this species was driven to extinction,” Moreau says.</p>





<p>Akito Kawahara, a lepidopterist at the Florida Museum of Natural History in Gainesville not involved with the study, thinks the results are “fairly convincing” that the Xerces blue butterfly was its own species.</p>



<p>The butterfly is considered a candidate for resurrection, Moreau says, where <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/resurrecting-extinct-species-raises-ethical-questions">extinct species are brought back via cloning</a> or other genetic manipulations (<em>SN: 10/20/17</em>). But she cautions against it. “Maybe we should spend that time and energy and money on ensuring that we protect the blues that are already endangered that we know about,” she says.</p>





<p>One of these insects is the endangered El Segundo blue (<em>Euphilotes battoides allyni</em>), native to the Los Angeles area. It and other butterfly populations are increasingly imperiled by numerous threats, such as climate change, land-use changes and <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/blog/science-ticker/evidence-piles-popular-pesticides-link-pollinator-problems">pesticide use</a> (<em>SN</em><em>: 8/17/16</em>).</p>



<p>For Felix Grewe, an evolutionary biologist at the Field Museum, the new finding illustrates why long-term museum collections are so important: Specimens’ true utility may not be clear for many years. After all, the genetic techniques used in the study to illuminate the Xerces blue butterfly’s true identity didn’t exist when the insect went extinct.</p>



<p>“You don&#8217;t know what technology there [will be] 100 years from now,” Grewe says.</p>

                <p><em>By </em><a href="http://emilyoliviareynolds.com/">Emily Reynolds</a></p>



<p>Despite the fact that psychology students are more likely to be women than men, and that women outnumber men in the clinical psychology workforce, women in psychology <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/1745691620952789">publish less</a>, receive fewer citations, and are underrepresented at senior positions within university departments. This juxtaposition of over and underrepresentation poses an interesting question about how people perceive gender roles within the field.</p>



<p>It’s this question Guy A. Boysen and team explore <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/00224545.2021.1921682?src=">in a new study</a>, published in the <em>Journal of Social Psychology</em>. They find that people associate psychology more strongly with femininity than masculinity — and that this may affect how men and women feel about working or studying within the field.</p>



<span id="more-42933"></span>



<p>In the first study, participants filling in surveys online were asked what percentage of students studying psychology at university level were women, and what percentage of psychologists were women. The results showed that people see psychology as a more women-heavy profession and discipline, with participants estimating that 62% of psychology students and 59% of psychologists are women.</p>



<p>A second study looked more directly at people’s perceptions of how “feminine” or “masculine” psychology is as a field. Both online participants and undergraduate students rated various university degrees and careers on a scale from “extremely feminine” to “extremely masculine”. The breadth of majors and careers listed were included due to their association with particular gendered stereotypes — engineering, for example, is stereotypically assumed to be a masculine job while nursing is thought to be feminine.</p>



<p>A psychology major was considered by both groups to be slightly more feminine than masculine, and was rated as significantly more feminine than typically &#8220;masculine&#8221; subjects like engineering, business, and maths (though majors like nursing and education were considered more feminine than psychology). Similarly, while a career in psychology was seen as less feminine than teaching or nursing, it was considered significantly more feminine than being a neuroscientist, historian, doctor, or business person.</p>



<p>In the next study, participants were asked to imagine a stereotypical person in one of three subjects at university: engineering, nursing, or psychology. After being shown stereotypically masculine and feminine traits — for example &#8220;gentle&#8221; for feminine or &#8220;egotistical&#8221; for masculine — participants rated how well each word described a person studying the subject they had been assigned.</p>



<p>As expected, participants tended to believe that both positive and negative masculine traits better described engineering students than psychology students, while positive feminine traits better described psychology students than engineers. The only difference between nursing and psychology was in positive masculine traits: these were believed to better suit nursing majors than psychology students. This suggests that psychology, like nursing, is largely considered to be a “feminine” subject.</p>



<p>In a fourth study, participants indicated how satisfied they believed men and women would be with a career in psychology. Participants who read that psychology students were 75% women and 25% men rated men’s satisfaction as significantly lower than women’s. But those who read there was an equal percentage of women and men didn’t show any difference in ratings of men’s and women’s satisfaction. A similar follow-up part of the study also found that men were seen as less likely to have their needs met by a career in psychology than women.</p>



<p>Overall, the results suggested that psychology is considered to be significantly more feminine than it is masculine, and that people assume men’s needs may therefore not be met by it as a subject of study or a career. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>But is this actually true? Future research could look at how men and women in psychology feel themselves — just because a field is perceived to be &#8220;feminine&#8221; doesn’t mean that men will necessarily be less satisfied or fulfilled when working within it. Whether men are actually put off careers in psychology is a different question that could be explored in more depth.</p>



<p>It’s also important to go back to the fact of the overrepresentation of men in certain positions. If psychology is seen as a &#8220;feminine&#8221; occupation, and if women outnumber men, why do men <a href="https://www.apa.org/pi/women/programs/gender-composition/task-force-report.pdf">dominate positions of power</a>? Looking at ways for everyone to succeed and feel comfortable in psychology is crucial.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/antarctica-microbes-habitability-aliens-extraterrestrial">Missing Antarctic microbes raise thorny questions about the search for aliens</a></h4>

              
                <p>Even in the harshest environments, microbes always seem to get by. They thrive everywhere from boiling-hot seafloor hydrothermal vents to high on Mt. Everest. Clumps of microbial cells have even been found clinging to the hull of the <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/space-bacteria-band-together-survival-years-astrobiology">International Space Station</a> (<em>SN: 08/26/20</em>).&nbsp;</p>



<p>There was no reason for microbial ecologist Noah Fierer to expect that the 204 soil samples he and colleagues had collected near Antarctica’s Shackleton Glacier would be any different. A spoonful of typical soil could easily contain billions of microbes, and Antarctic soils from other regions host at least a few thousand per gram. So he assumed that all of his samples would host at least some life, even though the air around Shackleton Glacier is so cold and so arid that Fierer often left his damp laundry outside to freeze-dry.</p>



<p>Surprisingly, some of the <a href="https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/2020JG006052">coldest, driest soils didn’t seem to be inhabited by microbes</a> at all, he and colleagues report in the June <em>Journal of Geophysical Research: Biogeosciences</em>. To Fierer’s knowledge, this is the first time that scientists have found soils that don’t seem to support any kind of microbial life.</p>



<p>The findings suggest that exceedingly cold and arid conditions might place a hard limit on microbial habitability. The results also raise questions about how negative scientific results&nbsp;should be interpreted, especially in the search for life on other planets. “The challenge comes back to this sort of philosophical [question], how do you prove a negative?” Fierer says.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="680" height="269" src="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/071421_EC_antarctic-microbes_inline.jpg" alt="Noah Fierer" class="wp-image-3101491" srcset="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/071421_EC_antarctic-microbes_inline.jpg 680w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/071421_EC_antarctic-microbes_inline-330x131.jpg 330w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><figcaption><span class="caption wp-caption-3101491">Noah Fierer and colleagues found soil samples from the Shackleton Glacier region of Antarctica that did not have traces of life, an unexpected observation since samples from the continent typically contain thousands of microbes.</span><span class="credit wp-credit-3101491">Courtesy of N. Fierer</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>Proving a negative result is notoriously difficult. No measurement is perfectly sensitive, which means there’s always a possibility that a well-executed experiment will fail to detect something that is actually there. It took years of experiments based on multiple, independent methods before Fierer of the University of Colorado Boulder and his collaborator Nick Dragone, finally felt confident enough to announce that they’d found seemingly microbe-free soils.&nbsp;And the scientists intentionally stated only that they were unable to detect life in their samples, not that the soils were naturally sterile.&nbsp;“We can’t say the soils are sterile. Nobody can say that,” Fierer says. “That’s a never-ending quest. There’s always another method or a variant of a method that you could try.”</p>



<p>Polar microbiologist Jeff Bowman sees the findings as an indication that current technology can&#8217;t detect very low levels of life, which can lead to false-negative results. “Certainly, there were things there,” says Bowman of the Scripps Institution of Oceanography in La Jolla, Calif. “This is Earth. This is an environment that is massively contaminated with life.” </p>



<p>Even if there were a few undetected microbes in the soil, said Dragone, that wouldn’t undermine his team’s evidence that cold and aridity pose a serious challenge to life. “It&#8217;s the combination of multiple very challenging environmental conditions that restricts life more than just one acting by itself,” says Dragone. “It&#8217;s a very different sort of restriction than, say, just high temperature.”</p>



<p>As scientists <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/nasa-perseverance-rover-mars-instruments-life">search for evidence of life beyond Earth</a> (<em>SN: 7/28/20</em>), they will inevitably be forced to walk the line between evidence of absence and absence of evidence.&nbsp;“What we&#8217;re trying to do on Mars is kind of the reverse of what we&#8217;ve tried to do on Earth,” says polar microbiologist Lyle Whyte of McGill University in Montreal. On Earth, claiming that an environment is lifeless is a tough scientific sell. On Mars, it will be the other way around.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/658792610/0/oupblogpsychology/">“Stop acting like a child”: police denial of Black childhood</a></h4>

              
                <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://blog.oup.com/2021/07/stop-acting-like-a-child-police-denial-of-black-childhood/"><img width="480" height="185" src="https://blog.oup.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/rochester-police-pepper-spray-9-year-old-480x185.jpg" loading="lazy" link_thumbnail="1" /></a><p>On 29 January 2021, Rochester police responded to an incident involving a Black nine-year-old girl, who they were told might be suicidal. An extended police <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2021/02/12/rochester-police-9-year-old/">body camera video of the incident</a> shows the agitated child, her mother, and an officer attempting to de-escalate the situation. The police detain the child by restraining her in handcuffs and placing her in the backseat of the police vehicle. Several of the nine officers who responded to the scene repeatedly threatened the child with pepper spray while detaining her. The child is shown begging the officers not to pepper spray her, crying hysterically, and repeatedly calling for her father. At one point, an officer says, “stop acting like a child,” to which she responds, “I am a child.” After the child is handcuffed and seated in the backseat of the police car, one of the police officers pepper sprays her and shuts the car door as the young girl screams inside.</p><p>As outrageous as this event was, it comports with existing psychological research conducted showing that people perceive Black children (but not White children) to be, on average, about <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://bma.issuelab.org/resources/21336/21336.pdf">4.5 years older</a> <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://www.oxfordclinicalpsych.com/view/10.1093/med-psych/9780190056742.001.0001/med-9780190056742-chapter-11">than they really are</a>. In turn, people deny Black children traits and attributes uniquely reserved for children—namely, childhood innocence—and, in turn, treat them more severely than White children, as if they were adults. Instead of attributing childhood innocence to the behavior of Black children, police instead dehumanize Black children (<a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://bma.issuelab.org/resources/21336/21336.pdf">implicitly associating them with apes</a>), and <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://www.oxfordclinicalpsych.com/view/10.1093/med-psych/9780190056742.001.0001/med-9780190056742-chapter-11">the more police officers dehumanize Black children, the more frequently they use physical force against Black (but not White) children</a>. The results of this research were so clearly demonstrated in real time by the Rochester police, who claimed to perceive an already detained and handcuffed Black, nine-year-old child to be a physical threat, in turn pepper-spraying her.</p><p>Although it is developmentally and psychologically normative for a nine-year-old to be fearful, cry, call for her father, and protest when multiple armed police officers attempt to detain her, the police in this instance instead blamed the nine-year-old for the event, attributing their use of force to her lack of cooperation. Indeed, at one point as the child begs to the officers, “Please don’t do this to me,” an officer is captured on camera telling the child, “<a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/pepper-spray-girl-rochester-police-b1801659.html">You did it to yourself, hon</a>.” The officers’ behavior reflects a grave lack of knowledge regarding the unique developmental and psychological behavior of children, generally. Importantly, substantial evidence reveals that <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://www.oxfordclinicalpsych.com/view/10.1093/med-psych/9780190056742.001.0001/med-9780190056742-chapter-9">Black and White children do not differ in basic psychological, emotional, and cognitive development</a>. For instance, <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://www.oxfordclinicalpsych.com/view/10.1093/med-psych/9780190056742.001.0001/med-9780190056742-chapter-9">research shows</a> that across all racial groups, children and adolescents (relative to adults) are disproportionately impulsive, sensation-seeking oriented, susceptible to peer influence, and prefer risk-taking with short-term over long-term potential rewards. Relatedly, Black and White youth do not differ in the extent to which they engage in various risk-taking criminal behaviors, like drunk driving and drug abuse.</p><p>Despite the absence of racial differences in basic psychological development, juvenile and criminal court decision makers consistently <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://www.oxfordclinicalpsych.com/view/10.1093/med-psych/9780190056742.001.0001/med-9780190056742-chapter-11">treat Black youth more harshly than White youth</a>. For instance, even though self-report data reveal that White youth report more drug abuse than Black youth, <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://www.ojjdp.gov/ojstatbb/">Black youth are significantly more likely to be arrested for drug abuse</a>. Moreover, even after holding constant factors like offense seriousness, <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://www.oxfordclinicalpsych.com/view/10.1093/med-psych/9780190056742.001.0001/med-9780190056742-chapter-11">Black youth (relative to White youth) are disproportionately detained,</a> arrested, sentenced severely, transferred to adult criminal court, and treated punitively within probation. The disproportionately punitive treatment of Black relative to White youth offenders can be explained by <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://www.oxfordclinicalpsych.com/view/10.1093/med-psych/9780190056742.001.0001/med-9780190056742-chapter-11">negative racial stereotypes about recidivism potential, maturity, and culpability of Black youth</a>, as well as dehumanization and the denial of childhood innocence of Black youth.</p><p>Notably, the Rochester police were not responding to a call involving criminal offending. Instead, they were responding to a call involving a mental health crisis—specifically, a suicidal nine-year-old child. Yet, substantial research suggests that otherwise ambiguous and developmentally normative child behavior (i.e., “loitering” or “disrespect”) is misinterpreted as “dangerous” <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://www.oxfordclinicalpsych.com/view/10.1093/med-psych/9780190056742.001.0001/med-9780190056742-chapter-8">and more frequently treated punitively with discipline when the child is Black than White</a>. The negative downstream consequences for racial minority youth are myriad. For instance, being stereotyped by police officers causes anxiety among Black youth—anxiety that has the <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://www.oxfordclinicalpsych.com/view/10.1093/med-psych/9780190056742.001.0001/med-9780190056742-chapter-9">potential to prevent them from calling police in an emergency situation</a>. Importantly, racial minorities who experience police brutality directly or vicariously (witnessing the abuse of others) are disproportionately likely to experience <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://spssi.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/josi.12251">negative mental health consequences</a> including anger, fear, and post-traumatic stress disorder. The implications of this research for the nine-year-old in Rochester are grim. To the extent that police use-of-force on an otherwise mentally healthy adult triggers mental illness, the negative mental health consequences of police-use-of-force on a suicidal nine-year-old child are likely even more serious.</p><p>As harmful as this experience of individual racism likely was for this nine-year-old, it is important to consider the impact of systemic and institutionalized racism affecting racial minority children within the justice systems. Negative experiences like these, which are disproportionately experienced by Black youth, set the stage for cascading and cumulatively negative future outcomes, occurring at each decision-point within the justice system (i.e., arrest, detainment, bail, verdicts, sentencing, probation, etc.). Understanding early experiences of racial minority youth is critical for understanding the scope of the disproportionately negative outcomes experienced by racial minority adults within the justice systems. Psychological scientists ought to continue conducting research to expose the unjust and damaging experiences of racial minority children within the legal system. Importantly, their work should not end in the lab. Instead, psychologists ought to use this research to advocate for law and policy change to end the disproportionately harmful impact of racism on the lives of children.</p><p><em>Featured image: <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/culture-news/rochester-police-pepper-spray-nine-year-old-girl-1121844/">Rochester Police Department</a> via Youtube</em></p><Img align="left" border="0" height="1" width="1" style="border:0;float:left;margin:0;padding:0;width:1px!important;height:1px!important;" hspace="0" src="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/i/658792610/0/oupblogpsychology"><div style="clear:both;padding-top:0.2em;"><a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/2/658792610/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/fbshare20.png" style="border:0;margin:0;padding:0;"></a>&#160;<a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/28/658792610/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/fblike20.png" style="border:0;margin:0;padding:0;"></a>&#160;<a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/16/658792610/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/linkedin20.png" style="border:0;margin:0;padding:0;"></a>&#160;<a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/29/658792610/oupblogpsychology,https%3a%2f%2fblog.oup.com%2fwp-content%2fuploads%2f2021%2f07%2frochester-police-pepper-spray-9-year-old-480x185.jpg"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/pinterest20.png" style="border:0;margin:0;padding:0;"></a>&#160;<a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/1/658792610/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/reddit20.png" style="border:0;margin:0;padding:0;"></a>&#160;<a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/24/658792610/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/twitter20.png" style="border:0;margin:0;padding:0;"></a>&#160;<a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/19/658792610/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/email20.png" style="border:0;margin:0;padding:0;"></a>&#160;<a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/20/658792610/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/rss20.png" style="border:0;margin:0;padding:0;"></a><h3 style="clear:left;padding-top:10px">Related Stories</h3><ul><li><a rel="NOFOLLOW" href="https://blog.oup.com/2021/07/lets-raise-our-taxes-infrastructure-and-the-american-character/">Let&#8217;s raise our taxes!

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/pika-yak-poop-winter-slow-metabolism-yak-biology">Pikas survive winter using a slower metabolism and, at times, yak poop</a></h4>

              
                <p>Winter on the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau is unfriendly to pikas. Temperatures across the barren, windy highlands routinely dip below –30° Celsius, and the grass that typically sustains the rabbitlike mammals becomes dry and brittle. It would seem the perfect time for these critters to hibernate, or subsist on stores of grass in burrows to stay warm, like the North American pika.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Instead, plateau pika (<em>Ochotona curzoniae</em>) continue foraging in winter, but <a href="https://www.pnas.org/cgi/doi/10.1073/pnas.2100707118">reduce their metabolism by about 30 percent</a> to conserve energy, researchers report July 19 in the <em>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.</em> Some pikas also resort to unusual rations: yak poop.</p>



<p>Camera data from four sites confirmed that pikas regularly brave the cold to forage. “Clearly they’re doing something fancy with their metabolism that’s not hibernation,” says John Speakman, an ecophysiologist at the University of Aberdeen in Scotland.</p>



<p>Speakman and colleagues measured daily energy expenditure of 156 plateau pikas in summer and winter, and implanted 27 animals with temperature sensors. While many nonhibernating animals keep warm in winter by <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/blog/wild-things/eight-ways-animals-survive-winter">using more energy</a>, these pikas did the opposite (<em>SN: 1/22/14</em>). On average, pikas reduced their metabolism by 29.7 percent, in part by cooling their bodies a couple degrees overnight. The animals were also less active, relative to summertime levels.</p>





<p>But at sites with yaks, pikas were more abundant but even less active. That puzzled the researchers “until we found a sort of half-eaten yak turd in one of the burrows,” Speakman says.&nbsp;Eating excrement can cause sickness. But with few options, yak poop could be an abundant, easily digestible meal that “massively reduces the amount of time [pikas] need to spend on the surface,” he says.</p>



<p>The researchers caught pikas scarfing scat on video, and DNA evidence from stomach contents solidified that this behavior is common. Whether dining on dung has downsides remains to be seen, but clearly, not being too picky pays off for pika.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/~r/plos/Blog/~3/kp4x1NIC-3A/">Engaging with article metrics: own your impact narrative</a></h4>

              
                <!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/loose.dtd">
<html><body><p>As <a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2021/03/a-farewell-to-alm-but-not-to-article-level-metrics/">we wrote back in March</a>, PLOS was an early adopter and advocate of metrics at the article level. The move to article-level metrics (often known as altmetrics) is &ldquo;<a href="http://altmetrics.org/manifesto/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>defined</em></a><em> by its belief that research impact is best measured by diverse real time data about how a research artifact is being used and discussed.&rdquo;&nbsp;</em></p>



<p>Article-level metrics/altmetrics have always been presented as alternatives to solely relying on traditional shorthand assessments like total citation counts and the reductive Journal Impact Factor. Hopefully, a <a href="https://personal.ntu.edu.sg/mwtang/ifuse.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">detailed critique</a> of the<a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2016/07/impact-factors-do-not-reflect-citation-rates/"> perils and misuse</a> of journal-level impact metrics is not needed in this day and age, suffice to repeat that it is unscientific to convey more credit and reward to one researcher&rsquo;s article over another&rsquo;s based solely upon the Journal Impact Factor of the venue of publication.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We&rsquo;re hopeful that culture is changing, thanks to&nbsp;the efforts of <a href="https://sfdora.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">DORA</a> and other organizations advocating, and now providing <a href="https://sfdora.org/dora-case-studies/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">concrete guidance</a>, for the responsible use of metrics in research assessment. Also, some funders, like the Howard Hughes Medical Institute (HHMI), are <a href="https://www.hhmi.org/programs/biomedical-research/investigator-program/review" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">making explicit</a> how they review their HHMI Investigators, clearly encouraging them to tell the full story of their impact beyond a simple publication record.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Researchers like you can help. The purpose of this post is to empower researchers to engage with a variety of accessible altmetrics, and signals of rigorous research practice, to define your research article&rsquo;s unique &ldquo;impact narrative&rdquo; and more effectively showcase its strengths.&nbsp;</p>



<h3><strong>What metrics and signals can articles offer?</strong></h3>



<p>Knowing and highlighting your article-level metrics helps<strong> </strong>facilitate and normalize more appropriate assessment. When relying on metrics to describe your work, use detailed metrics that are <strong>specific to your article </strong>such as:</p>



<ul><li>Citations over time</li><li>Usage over time</li><li>Attention (beyond citations) over time (e.g. from news outlets, policies, social media) often measured as &ldquo;altmetrics&rdquo;</li></ul>



<p>The data displayed on PLOS articles&rsquo; &ldquo;<a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article/metrics?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0223447" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Metrics</a>&rdquo; tab showcases how many times the article has been viewed, cited, saved, and discussed, and clicking on any of the sections opens up the details (e.g. which articles have cited this article).</p>



<p>Metrics can also be enhanced by other knowable signals that convey specific qualities about your article. Some of the most general of these are listed below:</p>



<ul><li>Peer-review status</li><li>Open availability of peer review report/decision letters</li><li>Availability of Open data/code/protocols/materials</li><li>Adherence to relevant ethical standards for research</li><li>Adherence to standards for rigorous research reporting (e.g. those of <a href="https://www.equator-network.org/reporting-guidelines/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">EQUATOR network</a>, <a href="https://arriveguidelines.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ARRIVE</a>, or <a href="https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2103238118" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">MDAR</a>)</li></ul>



<p>At PLOS, to showcase peer-review status, all articles show the Editor who handled the submission, the peer review timeline, and, if the authors chose the option, the published peer review report.&nbsp;</p>



<p>When publishing your research, you can make choices that help you demonstrate your commitment to rigor and credibility. When publishing with PLOS you <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/s/data-availability" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">commit to share your underlying data</a>. You may also choose to <a href="https://plos.org/open-science/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">share your protocols, your code, to pre-register your study, and to publish the peer review history of your papers</a>. These are important choices that affirm your commitment to transparency and to your results being available to the scientific community to build upon. You can highlight these choices too, in addition to metrics!</p>



<p><strong>Which metrics and signals should I use to tell my Impact Narrative?</strong></p>



<p>To establish an effective Impact Narrative, showcase altmetrics that are the most <strong>relevant to the intentions of your research. </strong>Below are some ways this could be done. None of the examples below are mutually exclusive, researchers could be electing to promote all of these qualities:</p>



<h4><strong>Impact narratives: examples</strong></h4>



<ul><li>If citations are still the most useful measure of impact for your intentions, ensure you list your article with the <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article/metrics?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0223447#citedHeader" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">most up to date citation counts</a> (including the <a href="https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1121478694" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">details</a>) rather than stating the Impact Factor of the journal you published in (especially if that score is calculated based on past articles that are not your own!)&nbsp;</li><li>If you intended your research to get the attention of the public in a geographic region, or of a particular community, showcase the <a href="https://plos.altmetric.com/details/67678982/news" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">media mentions </a>and <a href="https://plos.altmetric.com/details/67678982/twitter" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">social media coverage</a> you received in those target areas/communities. Each article has a great <a href="https://plos.altmetric.com/details/67678982" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">summary page</a>, or you can highlight specific data points within that. Explore!</li><li>If having your article openly peer reviewed was of particular importance to you, ensure you link directly to the <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article/peerReview?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0223994" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">published reviewer reports</a>.</li><li>If having your protocol readily available to be built upon is of particular importance, highlight <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.17504/protocols.io.bubqnsmw" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">this</a>.</li><li>If ensuring your data is open and reusable was an impact you were striving for, ensure you always highlight that your data is openly available (your PLOS article will always show this in the Data Availability Statement), and if your data is published on a data publication platform (example <a href="https://zenodo.org/record/4685118#.YOiSGOhKiUk" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">datasets </a>connected to a <em>PLOS Genetics</em> <a href="https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pgen.1009364" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">article</a>), highlight that unique usage too!&nbsp; In general, always remember to demonstrate your impact in additional ways than always related to the article itself &mdash; by showcasing any reuse or extension of your data, code, protocols, etc.</li></ul>



<h3><strong>Conclusion</strong></h3>



<p>We encourage showcasing the signals of rigorous research practices. We encourage <em>engagement</em>, but not obsession, with metrics. Article-level metrics and altmetrics are intended to be useful, and metrics themselves are neutral, but any metric has the potential to be misused, over-interpreted, over-engineered, and gamed, by actors invested in a system. Therefore, here at PLOS, we believe the key is to always:</p>



<ul><li><strong>Be transparent</strong> (e.g. show the maximum or most accurate detail available, even if an average or total is displayed or used)</li><li><strong>Engage with metrics and signals</strong> to ensure <em>you </em>own the way they should relate to you (e.g. create own your impact narrative)</li></ul>

<br /><p><strong>Abstract</strong></p>
<p>The purpose of this tutorial is to introduce participants to the tools they need in order to comfortably and confidently work with a Unix/Linux command line terminal.
Unlike graphical user interfaces, which are often self-explanatory or have obvious built-in help options, the purely text-based nature of a command line terminal can be intimidating and confusing to novice users.
Yet, once mastered, the command line offers more flexibility and smoother workflows for many tasks, while being entirely irreplaceable for things such as cluster&nbsp;access.</p>
<p>In this tutorial, we aim to introduce participants to the concepts and tools they need to confidently operate within a Unix/Linux command line environment.
In particular, the tutorial is developed for Bash (as per the title), which should cover most Linux and MacOS* use cases.
We hope to provide participants with a firm understanding of the basics of using a shell, as well as an understanding of the advantages of working from a command&nbsp;line.</p>
<p>The tutorial is aimed not only at novices who have rarely or never used a command line, but also at occasional or even regular users of bash who seek to expand or refresh their repertoire of everyday commands and the kinds of quality-of-life tricks and shortcuts that are rarely covered on StackExchange&nbsp;questions.</p>
<p>* While MacOS has switched from <code>bash</code> to <code>zsh</code> as its default shell, <code>zsh</code><span class="quo">&#8216;</span>s operation is sufficiently similar for the purposes of this&nbsp;tutorial.</p>
<p><strong>Prerequisites</strong></p>
<p>A working copy of bash; participants on Linux and MacOS are all&nbsp;set.</p>
<p>Participants on Windows have several options to get hold of a bash environment without leaving familiar&nbsp;territory:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Install <a class="reference external" href="https://gitforwindows.org/">Git for Windows</a>, which includes a Git Bash emulation with most of the standard tools you might expect in a Linux/Unix environment, plus of course&nbsp;Git.</li>
<li>Alternatively, <a class="reference external" href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10#install-the-windows-subsystem-for-linux">enable <span class="caps">WSL2</span></a> and <a class="reference external" href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-gb/p/ubuntu/9nblggh4msv6">install Ubuntu</a> as a virtual machine hosted by Windows. Somewhat ironically, this requires at least one use of a command line terminal (though not bash); on the upside, the Linux-on-Windows experience can be a smooth and safe first step into Linux&nbsp;territory.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Topics</strong></p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Basics to refer back to: Operating your bash shell (with key bindings and&nbsp;patience)</li>
<li>The grammar of a shell command&nbsp;line</li>
<li>Getting around: navigating within and beyond your computer: <code>~</code>, <code>pwd</code>, <code>cd</code>, <code>pushd</code>/<code>popd</code>, <code>ssh</code></li>
<li>Seeing what&#8217;s there: <code>ls</code>, globbing, and strategies for naming your&nbsp;files</li>
<li>File system manipulations: <code>mv</code>, <code>cp</code>/<code>scp</code>, <code>rm</code>, <code>mkdir</code>, <code>rmdir</code>, <code>ln -s</code>, <code>touch</code></li>
<li>Looking into files: <code>cat</code>, <code>head</code> <span class="amp">&amp;</span> <code>tail</code>, <code>more</code> or <code>less</code>, <code>grep</code>, <code>diff</code></li>
<li>Text manipulation: <code>sed</code>, <code>sort</code>, <code>uniq</code>, <code>cut</code>, <code>column</code></li>
<li>Putting things together: piping and&nbsp;redirection</li>
<li>What to do when stuck: <code>man</code>, I need some <code>help</code> here <code>apropos</code> of this&nbsp;command&#8230;</li>

<br /><p><strong>Abstract</strong></p>
<p>Version control is a necessary skill that users writing any amount of code should possess.
Git is a popular version control tool that is used ubiquitously in software&nbsp;development.</p>
<p>This hands-on session is aimed at beginners who have little or no experience with version control systems and Git.
It will introduce the basics of version control and walk through a common daily Git workflow before moving on to show how Git is used for collaborative development on popular Git forges such as GitHub.
Finally, it will show some advanced features of Git that aid in debugging code&nbsp;errors.</p>
<p><strong>Prerequisites</strong></p>
<p>The session is intended to be a hands-on session, so all attendees will be expected to run Git commands.
A working installation of Git is, therefore, required for this session.
We will use GitHub as our Git remote for forking and pull/merge requests.
So a GitHub account will also be&nbsp;required.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Linux users can generally install Git from their default package manager:<ul>
<li>Fedora: <code>sudo dnf install git</code></li>
<li>Ubuntu: <code>sudo apt-get install git</code></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Windows users should use <a class="reference external" href="https://gitforwindows.org/">Git for Windows</a>.</li>
<li>MacOS users should use <code>brew</code> to install <code>git</code>: <code>brew install git</code>.</li>

<br /><p><strong>Abstract</strong></p>
<p>Python is amongst the most widely used programming languages today, and is increasingly popular in the scientific domain.
A large number of tools and simulators in use currently are either implemented in Python, or offer interfaces for their use via Python.
Python programming is therefore a very sought after skill in the scientific&nbsp;community.</p>
<p>This tutorial is targeted towards people who have some experience with programming languages (e.g. <span class="caps">MATLAB</span>, C, C++, etc), but are relatively new to Python.
It is structured to have you quickly up-and-running, giving you a feel of how things work in Python.
We shall begin by demonstrating how to setup and manage virtual environments on your system, to help you keep multiple projects isolated.
We&#8217;ll show you how to install Python packages in virtual environments and how to manage them.
This will be followed by a quick overview of very basic Python constructs, leading finally to a neuroscience-themed project that will give you the opportunity to bring together various programming concepts with some hands-on&nbsp;practice.</p>
<p><strong>Prerequisites</strong></p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>shell (participants on Linux and MacOS are all set; see below for Windows&nbsp;users)</li>
<li>Python 3.6.9 or higher (see below for info on&nbsp;installation)</li>
</ul>
<p>Participants on Windows have several options to get hold of a shell environment without leaving familiar&nbsp;territory:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Install <a class="reference external" href="https://gitforwindows.org/">Git for Windows</a>, which includes a Git Bash emulation with most of the standard tools you might expect in a Linux/Unix environment, plus of course&nbsp;Git.</li>

<p>In 2019, the telescope unveiled the <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/black-hole-first-picture-event-horizon-telescope">first image of a black hole</a>, revealing the supermassive beast 55 million light-years from Earth at the center of galaxy M87 (<em>SN: 4/10/19</em>). That lopsided orange ring showed the shadow of the black hole on its glowing accretion disk of infalling material. Since then, observations from the Event Horizon Telescope, or EHT, have yielded <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/event-horizon-eht-data-m87-black-hole-turbulence-wobble">more detailed views</a> of M87’s black hole (<em>SN: 9/23/20</em>). Now, EHT data have revealed new details of the supermassive black hole at the heart of a galaxy near our own, called Centaurus A.</p>



<p>Rather than zooming in close enough to see the black hole’s shadow, the new picture offers the clearest view yet of the powerful plasma jets erupting from the black hole. This perspective gives insight into <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41550-021-01417-w">how supermassive black holes blast such plasma jets into space</a>, researchers report online July 19 in <em>Nature Astronomy</em>.</p>



<p>“It’s a fairly impressive feat,” says radio astronomer Craig Walker of capturing the new high-resolution image. “These [jets] are some of the most powerful things in the universe,” says Walker, of the National Radio Astronomy Observatory in Socorro, N.M., who was not involved in the work. Because such superfast plasma streams are thought to <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/event-horizon-telescope-first-image-black-hole-questions">influence how galaxies grow and evolve</a>, astronomers are keen to understand how the jets form (<em>SN: 3/29/19</em>).</p>





<p>Researchers pointed the <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/event-horizon-telescope-black-hole-picture">global network of radio dishes</a> that make up the EHT at Centaurus A for six hours in April 2017, during the same observing run that delivered the first picture of a black hole (<em>SN: 4/10/19</em>). About 12 million light-years from Earth, Centaurus A is one of the brightest galaxies in the sky and is known for the huge jets expelled by its central black hole.</p>



<p>“They extend to pretty much the entire scale of the galaxy,” says Michael Janssen, a radio astronomer at the Max Planck Institute for Radio Astronomy in Bonn, Germany. “If we were to see radio light [with our eyes], and we were to look at the night sky, then we would see these jets of Centaurus A as a structure that is 16 times bigger than the full moon.”</p>



<p>Using the EHT, Janssen and colleagues homed in on the base of those jets, which gush out from either side of the black hole’s accretion disk. The new image is 16 times as sharp as previous observations of the jets, probing details less than one light-day across — about four times the distance from the sun to Pluto. One of the most striking features that the image reveals is that only the outer edges of the jets seem to glow.</p>

Janssen <em>et al</em>/<em>Nature Astronomy</em> 2021</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>“That’s still a puzzle,” Janssen says. One possibility is that the jets are rotating, which might cause material in some regions of the jets to emit light toward Earth, while others don’t. Or the jets could be hollow, Janssen says.</p>



<p>Recent observations of a few other galaxies have hinted that the jets of supermassive black holes are brighter around the edges, says Denise Gabuzda, an astrophysicist at University College Cork in Ireland, who wasn’t involved in the work. “But it’s been hard to know whether it was a common feature, or whether it was something quirky about the few that had been observed.”</p>



<p>The new view of Centaurus A’s black hole provides evidence that this edge-brightening is common, Gabuzda says. “It’s fairly rare to be able to detect the jets coming out in both directions, but in the images of Centaurus A … you can clearly see that both of them are brighter at the edges.”</p>



<p>The next step will be to compare the EHT image of Centaurus A with computer simulations based on Einstein’s general theory of relativity, to test how well relativity holds up in this extreme environment, Janssen says. Examining the polarization, or orientation, of the light waves emanating from Centaurus A’s jets could also reveal the structure of their magnetic fields — just as polarization <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/black-hole-picture-magnetic-fields-event-horizon-telescope">revealed the magnetism around M87’s black hole</a> (<em>SN: 3/24/21</em>).</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/climate-change-endangered-bonobos-nests">Climate change may be leading to overcounts of endangered bonobos</a></h4>

              
                <p>Climate change is interfering with how researchers count bonobos, possibly leading to gross overestimates of the endangered apes, a new study suggests.</p>



<p>Like other great apes, bonobos build elevated nests out of tree branches and foliage to sleep in. Counts of these nests can be used to estimate numbers of bonobos — as long as researchers have a good idea of how long a nest sticks around before it’s broken down by the environment, what’s known as the nest decay time.</p>



<p>New data on rainfall and bonobo nests show that the <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0252527">nests are persisting longer in the forests in Congo</a>, from roughly 87 days, on average, in 2003–2007 to about 107 days in 2016–2018, largely as a result of declining precipitation. This increase in nests’ decay time could be dramatically skewing population counts of the endangered apes and imperiling conservation efforts, researchers report June 30 in <em>PLOS ONE</em>.</p>



<p>“Imagine going in that forest &#8230; you count nests, but each single nest is around longer than it used to be 15 years ago, which means that you think that there are more bonobos than there really are,” says Barbara Fruth, a behavioral ecologist at the Max Planck Institute of Animal Behavior in Konstanz, Germany.</p>





<p>Lowland tropical forests, south of the Congo River in Africa, are the only place in the world where <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/bonobos-first-great-apes-adopt-orphan-infant-outside-group">bonobos</a> (<em>Pan paniscus</em>) still live in the wild (<em>SN: 3/18/21</em>). Estimates suggest that there are at least 15,000 to 20,000 bonobos there. But there could be as many as 50,000 individuals. “The area of potential distribution is rather big, but there have been very few surveys,” Fruth says.</p>



<p>From 2003 to 2007, and then again from 2016 to 2018, Fruth and colleagues followed wild bonobos in Congo’s LuiKotale rain forest, monitoring 1,511 nests. “The idea is that you follow [the bonobos] always,” says Mattia Bessone, a wildlife researcher at the Liverpool John Moores University in England. “You need to be up early in the morning so that you can be at the spot where the bonobos have nested, in time for them to wake up, and then you follow them till they nest again.”</p>



<p>In doing so, day after day, Fruth, Bessone and colleagues were first able to understand how many nests a bonobo builds in a day, what’s known as the nest construction rate. “It’s not necessarily one because sometimes bonobos build day nests,” Bessone says. On average, each bonobo builds 1.3 nests per day, the team found.</p>



<p>Tracking how long these nests stuck around revealed that the structures were lasting an average of 19 days longer in 2016–2018 than in 2003–2007. The researchers also compiled fifteen years of climate data for LuiKotale, which showed a decrease in average rainfall from 2003 to 2018. That change in rain is linked to climate change, the researchers say, and helps explain why nests have become more resilient.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="680" height="219" src="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/071421_pp_bonobo_inline1.jpg" alt="four images of nests up in trees" class="wp-image-3101517" srcset="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/071421_pp_bonobo_inline1.jpg 680w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/071421_pp_bonobo_inline1-330x106.jpg 330w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><figcaption><span class="caption wp-caption-3101517">These images show bonobo nests at different stages of decay. Knowing the time it takes for a nest to decay is crucial for estimating accurate bonobo numbers.</span><span class="credit wp-credit-3101517"><strong>© </strong>B. Fruth/MPI of Animal Behavior</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>By counting the numbers of nests and then dividing that number by the product of the average nest decay time and nest construction rate, scientists can get an estimate of the number of bonobos in a region. But if researchers are using outdated, shorter nest decay times, those estimates could be severely off, overestimating bonobo counts by up to 50 percent, Bessone says.</p>



<p>“The results are not surprising but also highlight how indirect (and therefore prone to errors) our methods of density estimates of many species are,” Martin Surbeck, a behavioral ecologist at Harvard University, wrote in an e-mail.</p>



<p>Technologies such as camera traps can be used to directly count animals instead of using proxies like nests and are the way forward for animal population studies, researchers say.  But until those methods become more common, nest counts remain vital for scientists’ understanding of bonobo numbers.</p>



<p>This phenomenon is probably not limited to bonobos. All great apes build nests, and nest counts are used to estimate those animals’ numbers too. So, the researchers say, the new results could have implications for the conservation of primates far beyond bonobos.</p>
