<p><em>By guest blogger</em> <a href="http://www.davidrobson.me/">David Robson</a></p>
<p>Socrates famously declared that “the unexamined life is not worth living” and that “knowing thyself” was the path to true wisdom. But is there a right and a wrong way to go about such self-reflection?<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Simple rumination – the process of churning your concerns around in your head – isn’t the answer. It’s likely to cause you to become stuck in the rut of your own thoughts and immersed in the emotions that might be leading you astray. Certainly, research has shown that people who are prone to rumination also often suffer from impaired <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1469029215000308">decision-making under pressure</a> and are at substantially increased risk of depression.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Instead, the scientific research suggests that you should adopt an ancient rhetorical method favoured by the likes of Julius Caesar and known as “illeism” – or speaking about yourself in the third person (the term was <a href="https://www.spectator.co.uk/2019/01/illeism-the-weird-habit-of-talking-about-oneself-in-the-third-person/">coined by Samuel Taylor Coleridge</a> from the Latin <em>ille</em> meaning “he, that”). If I was considering an argument that I’d had with a friend, for instance, I may start by silently thinking to myself “David felt frustrated that…” The idea is that this small change in perspective can clear your emotional fog, allowing you to see past your biases.</p>
<p>A bulk of research has already shown that this kind of third-person thinking can temporarily improve decision making. Now a <a href="https://psyarxiv.com/a5fgu">preprint</a> at <em>PsyArxiv</em> finds that it can also bring long-term benefits to thinking and emotional regulation. It is, according to the authors, “the first evidence that wisdom-related cognitive and affective processes can be trained in daily life and of how to do so.”</p>

<p>Grossmann’s aim is to build a strong experimental footing for the <a href="https://evidencebasedwisdom.com/">study of wisdom</a>, which had long been considered too nebulous for scientific inquiry. In one his earlier experiments, he established that it’s possible to measure wise reasoning and that, as with IQ, people’s scores matter. He did this by asking participants to discuss out-loud a personal or political dilemma, which he then scored on various elements of thinking long-considered crucial to wisdom, including: <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2019/04/03/people-with-greater-intellectual-humility-have-superior-general-knowledge/">intellectual humility</a>; taking the perspective of others; recognising uncertainty; and having the capacity to search for a compromise. Grossmann found that these wise-reasoning scores were far better than intelligence tests at <a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/doiLanding?doi=10.1037%25252Fa0029560">predicting emotional well-being, and relationship satisfaction</a> – supporting the idea that wisdom, as defined by these qualities, constitutes a unique construct that determines how we navigate life challenges.</p>
<p>Working with Ethan Kross at the University of Michigan, Grossmann has also looked for ways to improve these scores – with some striking experiments demonstrating the power of illeism. In a series of <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24916084">laboratory experiments</a>, they found that people tend to be humbler, and readier to consider other perspectives, when they are asked to describe problems in the third person.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Imagine, for instance, that you are arguing with your partner. Adopting a third-person perspective might help you to recognise their point of view or to accept the limits of your understanding of the problem at hand. Or imagine you are considering moving jobs. Taking the distanced perspective could help you to weigh up the benefits and the risks of the move more dispassionately.</p>
<p>This previous research only involved short-term interventions, however – meaning it was far from clear whether wiser reasoning would become a long-term habit with regular practice at illeism.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>To find out, Grossmann’s team first asked nearly 300 participants to describe a challenging social situation,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>while two independent psychologists scored them on the different aspects of wise reasoning (intellectual humility etc). The participants then had to fill out a daily diary for four weeks. Each day they had to describe a situation they’d just experienced, such as a disagreement with a colleague or some bad news. Half were prompted to do so in the first-person, while the others were encouraged to describe their trials from a third-person perspective. At the end of the study all participants repeated the wise-reasoning test.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Grossmann’s results were exactly as he hoped. While the control participants showed no overall change in their wise reasoning scores, those using illeism improved in their intellectual humility, perspective-taking and capacity to find a compromise.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>A further stage of the study suggested that this newfound wisdom also translated into greater emotional regulation and stability. After they had finished the four-week diary intervention, participants had to predict how their feelings of trust, frustration or anger about a close family member or friend might change over the next month – then, after that month was up, they reported back on how things had actually gone.</p>
<p>In line with other work on “affective forecasting”, the people in the control condition over-estimated their positive emotions and under-estimated the intensity of their negative emotions over the course of the month. In contrast, those who’d kept a third-person diary, were more accurate. A closer look revealed that their negative feelings, as a whole, were more muted, and that’s why their rosy predictions were more accurate. It seems their wiser reasoning had allowed them to find better ways to cope.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>I find these emotion and relationship effects particularly fascinating, considering the fact that illeism is often considered to be infantile. Just think of <a href="https://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=577">Elmo in Sesame Street</a>, or the intensely irritating <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Jimmy">Jimmy in Seinfeld</a> – hardly models of sophisticated thinking. Alternatively, it can be taken to be the sign of a narcissistic personality – the very opposite of personal wisdom. After all, Coleridge believed that it was a ruse to cover up one’s own egotism, and many of President Trump’s critics have pointed out with disapproval that <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-33943762">he often refers to himself in the third-person</a>. Clearly politicians like Trump may use illeism for purely rhetorical purposes, but when applied to genuine reflection, it appears to be a powerful tool for wiser reasoning.</p>
<p>As the researchers point out, it would be exciting to see whether the benefits apply to other forms of decision making besides the more personal dilemmas examined in Grossmann’s study. There’s reason to think they might. Previous experiments have shown, for instance, that <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10899-012-9311-3">rumination leads to worse choices in poker</a> (hence why expert players strive for a detached, emotionally distanced attitude), and that greater <a href="https://journals.aom.org/doi/abs/10.5465/amj.2007.26279217">emotional awareness and regulation can improve performance on the stock market</a>.</p>
<p>In the meantime, Grossmann’s work continues to prove that the subject of wisdom is worthy of rigorous experimental study – with potential benefits for all of us. It is notoriously difficult to increase general intelligence through brain training, but these results suggest that wiser reasoning and better decision making are within everyone’s power.</p>

<img alt="" class="attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image" height="110" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2019/05/old-nutrition-140x110.jpg" style="display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;" width="140" /><p>The <a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/malnutrition" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">WHO definition</a> of malnutrition includes deficiencies and excesses in the intake of nutrients and/or micronutrients, resulting in undernutrition and overweight, respectively. Malnutrition is a global issue, with evidence showing that undernutrition and overnutrition <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28940822" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">coexist</a> across lower and higher income countries. Although a <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s13679-015-0170-y" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">life-course approach</a> has been proposed to address the phenomenon of the double burden of malnutrition, the issue receives little attention in the older population.</p>
<p>In areas with rapid economic growth such as Hong Kong, health and social care have focused on suppressing the growing trend of overweight caused by increased food availability. Overweight and obesity are regarded as a <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s13679-015-0161-z" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">worldwide pandemic</a> in older adults, particularly in developed regions, given that these conditions are highly associated with cardiometabolic risk factors and disabilities. Meanwhile, undernutrition gets little attention.</p>
<h3><strong>What we found</strong></h3>
<p>Surprisingly, <a href="https://bmcgeriatr.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12877-019-1148-5?utm_source=bmc_blogs&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=null&amp;utm_campaign=blog_2019_bmcseriesblog" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">our study</a>, which investigated the nutritional status of 613 home-living older adults in Hong Kong, found that approximately one-third of those we studied were classified as undernourished or at risk of undernourishment. The literature has <a href="https://www.racgp.org.au/afp/2012/september/managing-undernutrition-in-the-elderly/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">shown</a> that undernutrition in older adults is associated with adverse health outcomes such as hospitalization, frailty, sarcopenia, prognosis, and mortality risk.</p>
<p>Our study findings are consistent with <a href="https://www.who.int/nutrition/topics/ageing/en/index1.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">those of the WHO</a> that malnutrition in the older population is a complex problem involving multiple dimensions. Among various socio-demographic and health-related factors, three of them were associated with malnutrition in our study: visual impairment, poor appetite, and meal-skipping behaviours. Except for poor appetite, the factors found in our study are distinct from those identified from <a href="https://academic.oup.com/advances/article/7/3/507/4653577" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">an earlier systematic review</a>, in which malnutrition was found associated with age, polypharmacy, general health or cognitive decline, poor self-reported health, impaired swallowing, and dysphagia.</p>
<blockquote><p>The nutritional needs of older adults in developed regions should not be neglected.</p></blockquote>
<p>Poor appetite is often reported as a factor contributing to malnutrition in older adults in the literature. <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12603-019-1159-0" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Anorexia of Aging</a> is generally accepted as a normal process of ageing. However, the findings of a <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12603-017-0872-9" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">qualitative study</a> suggested that poor appetite in older adults can be due to the poor food quality offered by meal services, their limited access to groceries, and a sense of loneliness. It appears that the loss of appetite can be due to modifiable factors in the psychosocial and environmental dimensions, rather than simply explained by <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12603-019-1195-9" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">physiological change</a> related to ageing.</p>
<h3><strong>Ways to address malnutrition in older adults</strong></h3>
<p>Our findings provide useful insights on interventions to address the high prevalence of malnutrition among older adults in developed regions.</p>
<p>Firstly, regular visual screening and timely eye care in geriatric services are essential. Visual impairment has often been overlooked as part of the ageing process. Our findings revealed that visual impairment may reduce the ability of older adults to prepare meals, reducing nutritional intake. This revealed how physical functioning is related to nutritional status in older adults.</p>
<p>Secondly, exploring the underlying reasons for poor appetite and skipping meals in this group is crucial. Although increasing food choices or seasoning may improve appetite or rectify the deficiency in micronutrients, psychosocial interventions would be needed should the appetite be affected by mood changes or loneliness. Canteens that offer well-balanced meals for older adults at a low cost could not only ensure intake of at least one nutritious meal but also provide a venue for social interaction.</p>
<p>Our study revealed that the nutritional needs of older adults in developed regions should not be neglected, given that malnutrition is a complex issue related to physical and psychosocial dimensions at the individual level as well as to health and social services at the societal level.</p>

<p>A recent news highlight reported the UK running on clean energy for over 100 hours is an example of one of many attempts to steer away from coal-based energy with potentially huge environmental impacts. Energy efficiency, reduction of carbon footprint and the impact on the environment has forced us to think of better ways to engineer systems that allow for more cost-effective and sustainable forms of energy. This emerging field of engineering is called energy engineering or energy systems engineering.</p>
<img alt="" class=" wp-image-11051 alignleft" height="210" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2019/05/earth-366722_1920-300x188.jpg" width="335" />
<p>In a recent commentary published in <em>BMC Chemical Engineering</em>, authors from Texas A&amp;M University, present the current state of engineered tools in energy generation. With an aim in the field to optimize energy production to be more cost-effective, environment-friendly and easily operational, the task ahead to design such mouldable systems is becoming increasingly challenging.</p>
<p>In breaking down what we know so far and the potential areas for growth in this sector, the authors of the commentary introduce some key methods of energy systems engineering that are potentially versatile enough to cater to the changing human and environmental needs and resourcefulness of its tools. They discuss the criteria for selection, methods of optimization of production, and flaws in the current system of energy production. In proposing potential new directions for the field, they propose industry-academia collaborations, the use of information technology, artificial intelligence and machine learning, with potentially tapping into interdisciplinary research allowing access of previously unused sources of energy, as the way forward towards cheap and clean energy.</p>

A qualitative study</a></h3>

<p>Who does not enjoy a good banter? However, have you ever thought about these friendly exchanges having a deep-rooted impact on your decisions? Researchers from the University of Bath analyse the effect of banter in an interview-based qualitative study among 24 trainee doctors.</p>
<p>They first go on to define what ‘banter’ comprises and to what extent it serves to shape their career choices. The content of the banter seems to be diverse but the most common themes among these medics seems to be judgement of demand, work/life balance, workload and personality. Authors note that comments from senior doctors, coupled with their experiences as a trainee, forces them to judge how and where they would best fit within the system. They found that humorous and stereotypical accounts of specialties often led to rivalry, particularly from and about surgeons. Also, lack of expertise featured quite prominently in “friendly banter”.</p>
<p>Earlier studies tended to show that propaganda towards or against certain practices, influenced how junior doctors picked their practices. In line with this, the trainee doctors reported as “not being influenced” by negative banter but, authors do note that these are not just taken at face value but are rather assimilated and weighed against other perceived information and experiences to make an informed career choice. In line with the study, “Banter often comprises stereotypes and caricatures, but despite its biases and distortions, it may still aid career choice”.</p>

<p>As new technologies emerge, more tools are invented with the aim of making life easier. However, training senior citizens to bring them up to speed with using this technology is certainly a challenge. A recent study published in BMC Geriatrics evaluates the learning and implementation of the smart phone and in particular, an interactive digital calendar app called ‘RemindMe’. This app was designed to be used by community-dwelling seniors with cognitive impairments, to be reminded timely to take their medications.</p>
<p>A total of 20 seniors who used RemindMe for six weeks took part in this study. RemindMe can be used for scheduling <img alt="" class="wp-image-11052 alignleft" height="216" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2019/05/5307148868_bfa96479d8_b-300x200.jpg" width="324" />of activities/events, with individual reminders that require conformation of reminders sent by SMS and further more allows self-monitoring based on the interaction with the app. The usefulness and the use of the app was recorded in feedback given by these 20 participants divided into four groups, with questions on how useful they found the reminders and how easy it was to use the app as an integral part of their daily lives.</p>
<blockquote><p>For some, RemindMe was a sign of modernity, symbolizing that the user was part of the rapid technologically developing society</p></blockquote>
<p>While some embraced these new technology-driven reminders, others found it hard to incorporate this into their daily life and often had difficulty using the smartphone, as the app in itself seems to be rather easy to use. Some also found it hard to change from their own regular calendars. In the event that they did manage to use it, they found the reminders helpful, giving them a sense of independence and control over their own lives. While analyzing the symbolic value of this study. The authors point out that “For some, RemindMe was a sign of modernity, symbolizing that the user was part of the rapid technology developing society”. They conclude that in order to promote seniors to embrace digital technology, they should be motivated to use it by clearly showing them the importance and the change it can bring to their everyday life.</p>
<h3><strong><em>BMC Family Practice:</em></strong> <a href="https://bmcfampract.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12875-019-0940-9?utm_source=bmc_blogs&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=null&amp;utm_campaign=blog_2019_bmcseriesblog">Perspective of healthy asymptomatic patients requesting general blood tests from their physicians: a qualitative study</a></h3>
<p>Quite often we see healthy individuals asking for referrals from their doctors to have blood tests without any obvious symptoms. While there are several studies looking at why doctors give in and do end up referring them for these blood tests, there is no study on the patients’ perspective as to why such tests are being requested in the first place. Researchers from Israel have presented a study where they interviewed 15 presumably healthy adults between the ages of 22 and 50 who have requested a prescription for blood tests with no apparent symptom of illness.</p>
<img alt="" class=" wp-image-11044 alignright" height="218" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2019/05/Health-access1-300x201.png" width="325" />
<p>With in-depth interviews, the authors identified three main reasons as to why these tests were being requested – those who requested the tests seem to need external validation that all is “OK” within them, they seem to think that periodic blood tests are beneficial in “catching things early”, or they are prompted by someone else’s illness to check if they are safe.</p>
<p>They seem to be requesting the blood tests, almost like annual dental exams, adding the routine blood test to their healthy lifestyle’s to-do list, like a healthy diet, stress reduction and regular exercise.  While some of them seemed to think there can really be no harm in taking these regular tests, other seemed to think that this thought was reinforced by adverts on media driving the need for early diagnosis of any potentially life-threatening condition and this is often when they have lost relatives due to conditions like Cancer.</p>
<p>This study highlights the gap between what is known to doctors and what is perceived by “patients”. Blood tests have in fact not proven to aid the early diagnosis of several disorders and also do not affect progression of the disease in many cases. Doctors acknowledge that early diagnosis in certain cases is important but in most cases these tests often lead to the waste of time and money, often leading to patient anxiety and unnecessary procedures.</p>
<p>The study has substantial practical implications and highlights the fact that doctors should be more proactive in understanding the patients’ motivations, aiming to educate them about when these tests are really necessary, preventing both unnecessary financial burden and potential health risk arising from harmful over-exposure to diagnostic tools.</p>

<p><img alt="" class="size-medium wp-image-11050 alignleft" height="180" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2019/05/syringe-1884784_1920-300x180.jpg" width="300" />Triple-negative breast cancer is both very aggressive and compounded by limited treatment option availability. In order to further understand this form of breast cancer, and derive potential treatment plans, as in other cancers, researchers from Tulane University in New Orleans have turned to patient-derived xenografts, whereby in you inject breast cancer cells taken from a patient into the animal – mice in this case, giving the cells a more human tumour-like characteristic than those purely developed in the lab.</p>
<p>After verifying that the cells injected into mice did indeed recapitulate the original cancer, the authors went on to make 2D and 3D cultures from these cells to test if a certain drug combination would prove effective in this case or not, prior to treatment of the actual patient, and also see if the tumour develops resistance to the drug. They employed a simple dead or alive staining first to determine if after treatment with a standard drug set had any effect. This allows them to broadly classify the drugs as those that prevent further growth versus those that have no effect on the tumour.</p>
<p>They identify that these cells were more sensitive to certain classes of drugs such as those that affect physical constraints within and around the cells, but resistant to others. They note that there are differences in how 2D cultures (a single sheet of cells) respond to treatment as opposed to 3D cultures, that are more complex in structure and characteristic, more similar to what can be found in real tumors. While this system has been tested here with just one form of cancer, and to known drugs, the system and the rather simplistic screen procedure allows for potential expansion and pre-clinical testing across all cancer types and the entire gamut of drugs that are approved in the market. It could also be further expanded to identify efficient drugs against rare and more aggressive cancer types that have, in the past, proved rather difficult to halt, identify and treat.</p>

<p>Philosophers and mathematicians have long held that maths can be aesthetically pleasing. “Mathematics, rightly viewed, possesses not only truth, but supreme beauty,” <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/25447/25447-h/25447-h.htm">wrote</a> Bertrand Russell, while Carl Friedrich Gauss <a href="https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Carl_Friedrich_Gauss">proclaimed that</a> “The enchanting charms of this sublime science reveal themselves in all their beauty only to those who have the courage to go deeply into it”.</p>
<p>But <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0010027719300927">a study published recently in <em>Cognition</em></a> suggests that even those whose lives don’t revolve around logic and numbers also have an appreciation for mathematical “beauty”. People tend to see similarities between mathematical proofs and certain paintings or pieces of music, the study finds, suggesting we all share an intuition for the aesthetics of mathematics.</p>
<p><span id="more-37197"></span></p>
<p>In their first study, Samuel Johnson at University of Bath School of Management and Stefan Steinerberger at Yale University asked 300 online participants (200 of whom had not studied maths beyond school level) to read four mathematical arguments. These were written to be accessible even to lay people, and included proofs like those below. The one on the left illustrates that the sum of an infinite geometric series adds to 1, while the other on the right shows that adding consecutive odd numbers always gives a square number.</p>

<p>The participants tended to agree on the similarity of the various arguments and paintings. For example, when the researchers ranked each participant’s 16 painting-argument ratings from most to least similar, there was significant overlap between participants. And the participants tended to see particular mathematical arguments as being most strongly related to a specific artwork (for example, overall they viewed the proof concerning the sum of consecutive odd numbers as most similar to the Constable painting).</p>
<p>This consensus among participants regarding how the maths arguments related to the artworks suggests that people share an intuition about the aesthetics of maths, the authors say – otherwise the similarity ratings would have been randomly distributed between participants. “Mathematical beauty, then, does not appear to be solely in the eye of the beholder but appears to have deep psychological roots,” they write.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>The researchers repeated the experiment, replacing artworks with pieces of classical music, including the fugue from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5mVqAbdUvd0">Bach’s Toccata in E Minor</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX_8-nmLLHk">Beethoven’s Diabelli Variations</a>. Overall, participants’ ratings of the similarity of the maths and music were much higher than the maths/art similarity ratings in the previous study (the authors suggest that “music is imbued with a more mathematical character”), and again there was some consistency in ratings between participants.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Interestingly, similarity judgements were more consistent between groups with some level of mathematical training than between participants with and without much maths experience, suggesting that aesthetic judgments may change somewhat with expertise. (This idea was also supported by a third experiment, which suggested that participants with mathematical experience may use some additional criteria for judging the beauty of mathematical arguments compared to those without a maths background ).</p>
<p>The researchers have used a clever paradigm to demonstrate that even laypeople may assign some aesthetic quality to mathematical proofs – “almost as though they treat proofs <i>as</i> artworks”. But their experiments reveal frustratingly little about the broader relevance of assigning aesthetic values to abstract ideas. Some researchers have suggested that mathematicians use the “beauty” of an explanation as a guide to whether or not it is true, for example, and the authors seem to suggest that based on their results the same could hold for laypeople. However, they didn’t test this directly.</p>
<p>The way we use our aesthetic intuitions could have important implications. If people take into account the aesthetics of abstract ideas when making judgments about those ideas, then that suggests that perceived aesthetics could be a factor in everything from choosing between different scientific theories to making policy decisions, the researchers note. “We hope that this work serves as a broad call to action in investigating the aesthetics of abstract ideas,” they write.</p>

While AmeliCA shares cOAlition S’s goal of achieving universal open access, says Becerril-García, it fears that, as currently conceived, Plan S would disadvantage researchers in the Global South and exclude them further from the international scholarly publishing system.</span></span></div><div class="MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle" style="line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;"><br /></div><div class="MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle" style="line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;"><span>Historically, research institutions in the South have struggled to afford the fees necessary to buy access to international subscription journals. But a move to an OA system almost exclusively based on pay-to-publish (which Plan S seems likely to lead to), says Becerril-García, would see researchers in the South struggling to find the money to pay the article-processing charges (APCs) needed to publish their work in international journals. One problem would be replaced by another. </span><br /><span><br /></span><span>Plan S would also further increase the control that for-profit publishers have over the scholarly communication system, which </span><span>Becerril-García believes </span><span>is undesirable.</span></div><div class="MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle" style="line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;"><br /></div><div class="MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle" style="line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;"><span>What is needed, she says, is to build a “collaborative, non-commercial, sustainable and non-subordinated” system in which control is removed from commercial publishers and handed back to the academy.</span></div><div class="MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle" style="line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;"><br /></div><div class="MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle" style="line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;"><span>The role that AmeliCA and Becerril-García have played in the discussion over Plan S has been important and influential.

Following a consultation process, cOAlition S is due shortly to publish an updated set of implementation guidelines for Plan S.

So, for instance, she would like to see the funders provide money for “non-APC journals, academic open access platforms, technologies to support scholarly publishing, repositories and other scholarly communication tools.”</span></div><div class="MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle" style="line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;"><br /></div><div class="MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle" style="line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;"><span>To support her argument, Becerril-García points out that Latin America currently publishes between 13% and 20% of the articles produced by European researchers. “If Plan S intends to pay APCs to for-profit journals then why are the costs of publishing European papers in Latin America not worthy of being funded by Plan S too?”, she asks.</span></div><div class="MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle" style="line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;"><br /></div><div class="MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle" style="line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;"><span>The </span><span><a href="https://twitter.com/researcheurope/status/1128937565095190530?s=11">rumour on Twitter</a><span style="color: black;"> is that the new Plan S guidelines will be “less controversial” than initially proposed. Whether there will be sufficient changes to satisfy Becerril-García’s aspirations, or the needs of the Global South, remains to be seen. While cOAlition S has made sympathetic noises about helping the Global South, we must wonder if European funders will really prove willing to subsidise open platforms and OA journals in the Global South, or to create much in the way of a new scholarly infrastructure – not least because they have set themselves an extremely tight timetable to achieve 100% open access (2020).</span></span></div><div class="MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle" style="line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;"><br /></div><div class="MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle" style="line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;"><span>And are they really committed to wresting back control from for-profit publishers?</span></div><div class="MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle" style="line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;"><br /></div><div class="MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle" style="line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;"><span>What is surely also important, however, is that AmeliCA has independently set itself the goal of propagating the APC-free OA model that Redalyc has been developing since 2003.

The aim is to “democratise scientific knowledge following a multicultural, multi-thematic and multi-lingual approach”.</span></span></div><div class="MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle" style="line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;"><br /></div><div class="MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle" style="line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;"><span>Interestingly, just weeks after the launch of GLOALL, AmeliCA joined with the Plan S funders to sign the </span><span><a href="https://www.coalition-s.org/sao-paulo-statement-on-open-access/">São Paulo Statement on open access</a><span style="color: black;">. Becerril-García stresses, however, that “our signature on the São Paulo Statement must be understood as a commitment to an agreement between diverse platforms that all have open access as a common goal”. She adds, “It would be wrong, or mere innocence, to believe that we have changed our mind about our goals and objectives.”</span></span></div><div class="MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle" style="line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;"><br /></div><div class="MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle" style="line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;"><span>Whatever one’s views on Plan S, it has surely played a valuable role in focusing minds on the likely implications of moving to a pay-to-play publishing regime and the invidious position that researchers in the Global South find themselves in <i>vis-à-vis</i> the international scholarly publishing system.</span></div><div class="MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle" style="line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;"><br /></div><div class="MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle" style="line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;"><span>All of which leaves us with what Becerril-García calls the “million-dollar question”: is it possible to build a global system of scholarly communication able to meet the needs of everyone, and on a fair and equitable basis?

In the late decades of the last century, however, and even in this one, we have seen an excessive concentration of scholarly publishing in a few publishing houses – </span><span><a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0127502">the oligopoly</a><span style="color: black;">.</span></span></div><div class="MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle" style="line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;"><br /></div><div class="MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle" style="line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;"><span>Beyond the damage these publishers cause to the system of scholarly communication by their monopolistic activities (which is no small thing) we now face a situation where we are having to rely on a legitimation system based on metrics provided by two databases (</span><span><a href="https://login.webofknowledge.com/error/Error?Error=IPError&amp;PathInfo=%2F&amp;RouterURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.webofknowledge.com%2F&amp;Domain=.webofknowledge.com&amp;Src=IP&amp;Alias=WOK5">Web of Science</a><span class="MsoHyperlink"><span style="color: black;"> </span></span><span style="color: black;">and <a href="https://www.scopus.com/">Scopus</a></span><span style="color: black;">) that belong to private enterprises and whose entire focus is on making a commercial return. These companies’ interests lie in making governments and institutions believe (through their various “advisory groups”) that only research that is indexed by them is of sufficient quality to be worthy of being supported with resources.

Currently, it seems likely that Plan S will lead to the near-universal use of APCs.</span></div><div class="MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle" style="line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;"><br /></div><div class="MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle" style="line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;"><span>The Latin American model demonstrates that this need not be the outcome. For this reason, we are convinced that the strategies of Plan S, and of those countries with the economic power to change the current situation, should be focused on supporting a system in which open access journals are controlled by the academy – and without the payment of APCs. They should also be investing in the infrastructure and technology needed for science communication to be in the hands of academic institutions.

In other words, a strategy that emerges from the academy itself, not one devised by financiers or governments. And it should be one in which there are tangible developments in favour of open access – e.g. platforms, scholarly journals, repositories, technical infrastructure, books, groups of people such as editorial teams, policies, mandates, and so on, all working together, joining forces and sharing in order to build a sustainable model.</span></div><div class="MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle" style="line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;"><br /></div><div class="MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle" style="line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;"><span>A clear example of this can be seen at the <a href="https://unlp.edu.ar/">National University of La Plata</a></span><span><span style="color: black;"> in Argentina.

I assume therefore that cOAlition S would see real PR benefit in getting the São Paulo Statement agreed, if only as a way of suggesting that there is no fundamental conflict of interest between Plan S and research communities in the Global South. From what you say, I assume you do still see conflicts of interest. Either way, from the perspective of AmeliCA what was the logic of signing the statement?

                <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/~r/plos/Blog/~3/8cOKqikbOOA/">PLOS Journals Now OPEN for Published Peer Review</a></h4>

<img alt="" class="webfeedsFeaturedVisual wp-post-image" height="150" src="https://blogs.plos.org/plos/files/2015/10/5-690x3202-150x150.jpg" style="display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;" width="150" /><p> </p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Starting today, ALL PLOS journals will offer authors the option to publish their peer review history alongside their accepted manuscript! We’ve been excited to make this announcement, and make major strides towards a more open publication process, since last fall when we signed ASAPbio’s </span><a href="https://asapbio.org/letter"><span style="font-weight: 400;">open letter</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> committing to transparent peer review options.</span></p>
<p><b>What will it look like?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Our philosophy going into this project has been to open up the peer review process in a way that gives authors and reviewers more choices about how they publish and claim credit for their work. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As before, our peer review process defaults to single-blind, although reviewers have the option to sign their names to their reviews if they wish. What we’ve added to our process is an option at acceptance for authors to decide whether to publish the full peer review history alongside their work. This package includes the editor’s full decision letter, complete with reviewer comments and authors’ responses for each revision of the manuscript. Peer review history will have its own DOI enabling reviewers to take credit and earn citations for their contributions. If the reviewers have chosen to sign their reviews, their name will also appear on the published reviews but they can also chose to remain anonymous.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">All manuscripts submitted after May 22, 2019 will be eligible for this option if accepted at a PLOS Journal. Here’s a look at the variations of open our opt-in model provides:</span></p>
<p><a href="http://blogs.plos.org/plos/files/2019/05/TPR_chart-final-edited-003.jpg"><img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-8582" height="1452" src="http://blogs.plos.org/plos/files/2019/05/TPR_chart-final-edited-003.jpg" width="3000" /></a></p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>A major step for PLOS, and scholarly communication</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The peer review history reveals crucial perspectives and decisions that supply additional context for readers and researchers. Because of the potential benefits, we’re making this option available </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">now</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on all seven PLOS journals.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Other journals that have experimented with published peer review models have shown that the quality of feedback provided is at least as good as other models – we think it has the potential to be even better through increased accountability and transparency. We’re building off the foundations and lessons learned by these examples and are confident our model can offer authors more choices to make their research and the publishing process open, and showcase the rigorous review of their work. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Through the scale of our publishing output across all seven PLOS journals, we see this as an opportunity to make a significant change in the scholarly communication landscape and lay the foundation for a more open view of the manuscript handling process from start to finish.</span></p>
<p><b>Open beyond Open Access</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While the benefits of transparency are numerous, we see published peer review as a crucial first step towards solving two fundamental problems: reviewer credit and public understanding of the peer review process. So far, Open Access has made it possible for research to reach a global community of readers but we have not yet demonstrated the work that goes on behind the scenes to validate scientific claims.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Publishing peer review history is a means of enriching the scientific record by giving context to evaluation and publication decisions. We hope this is also an important step toward elevating peer reviews to scholarly outputs in their own right that reviewers can take credit for. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In conjunction with the work it describes, peer review history can also be a source of material for educating students and the general public about peer review. Our content is also machine readable, paving the way for deeper analysis and discussion by the community. </span></p>
<p><b>Looking ahead</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We’ve developed this option in consultation with our editors who are dedicated to improving our journals, and we also committed to reporting back our findings. As we learn more about how published peer review shapes author and reviewer choices, and reader experience, we’ll continue to update you on what we find.</span></p>

<p>Hikikomori is a dark term that describes people who stay holed up in their homes, or even just their bedrooms, isolated from everyone except their family, for many months or years. The phenomenon has captured the popular imagination with many articles appearing in the mainstream media in recent years, but, surprisingly, it isn’t well understood by psychologists.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>The condition was first described in Japan, but cases have since been reported in countries as far apart as Oman, Indian, the US and Brazil. No one knows how many hikikomori exist (the term refers both to the condition and the people with it), but surveys suggest that 1.79 per cent of Japanese people aged 15-39 meet the criteria. However, while some assumptions about risk factors have been made, based largely on reports of specific cases, there has been a lack of population-based research. A <a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyt.2019.00247/full?utm_source=F-AAE&amp;utm_medium=EMLF&amp;utm_campaign=MRK_969842_68_Psychi_20190423_arts_A">new study</a>, published in <em>Frontiers in Psychiatry</em>, plugs some of the knowledge gaps.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><span id="more-37194"></span></p>
<p>Roseline Yong and Kyoko Nomura analysed survey data from 3,287 male and female participants aged 15-39, who were randomly selected from 200 different urban and suburban municipalities all over Japan, representing a cross-section of Japanese society.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>The participants answered questions about how often they left their home (and for those who didn’t, how long they’d remained inside). Researchers classified as hikikomori anyone who, for at least the past six months, never or rarely left their home, unless they had a practical reason for staying in, such as being pregnant, being busy doing housework (yes, really), they were a homemaker, or they had a diagnosis of schizophrenia.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The respondents also answered demographic questions and questions about their mental health.</p>
<p>It has been suggested that hikikomori is primarily an urban phenomenon. But that’s not what Yong and Nomura found. Based on the survey data, 1.8 per cent of the respondents were hikikomori, but they were just as likely to live in a village as in a big city. The condition has also been considered more common among men, and this study provides the first epidemiological evidence to back this up. Still, 20 of the 58 hikikomori were female.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Yong and Nomura found no relationship with country region, number of family members or social class. But one local demographic variable did stand out as being protective: living in an area filled with businesses and shops.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>The hikikomori in the sample were more likely to have a history of psychiatric treatment, to have dropped out of school and to have a tendency towards violence to themselves (self-harming, for instance), but not to others. However, the most significant and strongest factor was a high level of interpersonal difficulties, as measured by the degree of agreement with questionnaire items like “I am anxious about the possibility of meeting people that I know”, “I am anxious about what others might think of me”, and “I cannot blend into groups”.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Yong and Nomura write: “These anxieties may be related to a sense of humiliation, which suggests that they are afraid of being seen in their current situation….Unlike anxieties found in social phobias or generalised social anxieties…. our finding of an association between hikikomori and interpersonal difficulties indicates that hikikomori fear people and the community that they know.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>This does suggest a possible route to treatment: “By carefully assessing the types of fears that they may have, our data suggest the possibility that improving communication skills and managing expectations may be helpful for combating hikikomori.” They note that this type of strategy has in fact already been tried, with some success.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>But if these anxieties are keeping people inside their homes, what’s prompting them to retreat there in the first place? The survey also revealed that hikikomori are more likely to have dropped out of high school or university. Perhaps finding ways to keep young people in education may, then, reduce the risk.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>The data also showed that a very high percentage – 37.9 per cent – of the hikikomori had a previous history of psychiatric treatment. “The higher proportion of hikikomori who are dependent on medication is also alarming,” the researchers add.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>How all these factors may inter-relate, as causes or perhaps results of hikikomori, is far from clear. As the researchers stress, further studies are clearly needed. However, this new work does provide some good pointers to the research avenues most worth exploring.</p>

<p><em>By</em> <a href="http://www.jessesingal.com/">Jesse Singal</a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Randomised experiments (also known as A/B testing) are an absolutely critical tool for evaluating everything from online marketing campaigns to new pharmaceutical drugs to school curricula. Rather than making decisions based on ideology, intuition or educated guess-work,  you randomise people to one of two groups and expose one group to intervention A (one version of a social media headline, a new drug, or whatever, depending on the context ), one group to intervention B (a different version of the headline, a different drug etc), and compare outcomes for the two groups. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To anyone who believes in evidence-based decision making, medicine and policy, randomised tests make sense. But as a team led by Michelle N. Meyer at the Center for Translational Bioethics and Health Care Policy at the Geisinger Health System in Pennsylvania, </span><a href="https://www.pnas.org/content/early/2019/05/08/1820701116"><span style="font-weight: 400;">write in </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">PNAS</span></i></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, for some reason A/B testing sometimes elicits moral outrage. As an example, they point to the anger that ensued when Pearson Education “randomized math and computer science students at different schools to receive one of three versions of its instructional software: two versions displayed different encouraging messages as students attempted to solve problems, while a third displayed no messages.” The goal had been to test objectively whether the encouraging messages would, well, encourage students to do more problems, yet for this, the company received much criticism, including accusations that they’d treated students like guinea pigs, and failed to obtain their consent.</span></p>
<p><span id="more-37187"></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Viewed from a certain angle, this reaction is strange – prior to the A/B testing Pearson’s </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">default</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> policy had been a lack of encouraging message, which didn’t appear to generate any complaints. People didn’t have a problem with a lack of encouraging messages, or with encouraging messages – they only had a problem with comparing the two conditions. Which doesn’t quite make sense. (As Meyer’s team point out, there </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">are</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> situations in which A/B testing could be genuinely unethical. Giving one group an already validated cancer treatment but withholding it from another, for example, is clearly morally problematic. But Meyer and her colleagues focus entirely on “unobjectionable policies or treatments.”)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At root, Meyer et al’s paper had two goals: To determine how widespread this phenomenon is (after all, sometimes there’s a perception that many people are mad about something, but it’s really just a small group of loud people online who have strong opinions), and to poke and prod people’s reasons for experiencing discomfort at the idea of A/B testing. The team used online samples to probe these issues, conducting “16 studies on 5,873 participants from three populations spanning nine domains.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As it turns out, it isn’t just a small group of online complainers who are uncomfortable: Based on the new findings, it appears that humans have a more general bias against this sort of A/B testing, for reasons that are hard to pin down.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Take Meyer and her colleagues’ first study. They presented online participants with a vignette in which a hospital director, seeking to lower the rate of death and illness caused by a procedure being performed improperly, thinks it might be helpful to present doctors with a safety checklist. Participants then read one of four versions of what happened next and they had to rate the appropriateness of the course of action taken:</span></p>
<blockquote><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Badge (A): The director decides that all doctors who perform this procedure will have the standard safety precautions printed on the back of their hospital ID badges.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Poster (B): The director decides that all rooms where this procedure is done will have a poster displaying the standard safety precautions.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A/B short: The director decides to run an experiment by randomly assigning patients to be treated by a doctor wearing the badge or in a room with the poster.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A/B learn: Same as A/B short, with an added sentence noting that after a year, the director will have all patients treated in whichever way turns out to have the highest survival rate.</span></p></blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As the researchers predicted, there was more opposition to both forms of the A/B testing than to the unilateral introduction of either safety policy. This finding was robust to multiple versions of the vignette and held up whether the researchers used participants recruited via Pollfish or Amazon’s Mechanical MTurk.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The same phenomenon also popped up in a wide variety of other (hypothetical) situations, from the design of self-driving cars to interventions to boost teacher wellbeing. And the authors write that “the effect is just as strong among those with higher educational attainment and science literacy and those with STEM degrees, and among professionals in the relevant domain.” So it’s not as though this bias can be chalked up to a lack of knowledge about the scientific process, or some sort of lack of critical-thinking skills.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">does</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> explain it, then? The researchers believe that a combination of factors are at work, among them “a belief that consent is required to impose a policy on half of a population but not on the entire population; an aversion to controlled but not to uncontrolled experiments; and the proxy illusion of knowledge,” the last of which the researchers define as the belief that “randomized evaluations are unnecessary because experts already do or should know ‘what works.’”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To many of the sorts of people who rely on A/B testing, of course, this sort of reasoning doesn’t pass muster (why would it be okay to impose a policy on the full population but not half it?). We clearly need more research to better understand the public’s concerns and how to respond to them, given how important A/B testing is in so many different circumstances (and that it is only going to become more common as organisations become more science- and data-focused). For now, though, it’s an important first step to have established that this bias generalises to various different populations and isn’t driven by any one simple factor.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To mark the launch of the new Anesthesia and Perioperative Care for Solid Organ Transplantation section in <em>BMC Anesthesiology</em>, the section editors have written an editorial describing the history and role of anesthesiology in organ transplantation. They discuss the many advancements in anesthesia that have contributed to successful organ transplantation, as well as the current challenges that exist when performing transplantations of specific organs. As the Section Editors Drs. Saner and Bezinover note, the field of transplant anesthesia is underrepresented in major anesthesia conferences and journals. With this new section, they hope to attract high-quality studies that continue to shed light on this important area of anesthesia research.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Adhesions, scar tissue that can lead to organs or tissues sticking to each other, are common occurrences after surgery, especially abdominal surgery. While they often do not cause injury to patients, they can sometimes cause pain or lead to further complications. As common as adhesions are, developing effective preventative measures has remained a challenge. In this review, Capella-Monsonís <em>et al.</em> provide an overview of the molecular pathways involved in adhesion formation and the latest advances in the approaches used to limit them. Methods for preventing adhesions include surgical procedures, mechanical barriers, antiadhesive agents, and physical therapy. Although numerous products and procedures have been developed, further research is still needed to design new therapies and improve the efficacy and safety of existing ones.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Overabundance of carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">) in the atmosphere is a key driver of climate change and there is an urgent need to reduce current levels of emissions. This review by <em>Vooradi et al.</em>, published in one of our newest journals, <em>BMC Chemical Engineering</em>, explores the opportunities and challenges facing chemical and related industries in managing CO<sub>2</sub> emissions and energy consumption. These industries are highly energy-intensive and currently consume most of their energy from non-renewable sources — namely fossil fuels — whose industries also contribute to CO<sub>2</sub> emissions. The authors write that one of the major challenges is shifting away from fossil fuels to renewable energy while still meeting global demand for the products of chemical industries. They suggest that when approaching these issues, industry should consider a strategy implementing multiple changes with the aim of increasing process efficiency, including adopting carbon capture and storage technologies. It may sound like a daunting task to meet the Paris Agreement’s goal of limiting the global temperature increase by 1.5 °C by the start of the next century, but understanding how chemical industries can respond is essential to help meet this goal.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Garlic has long been used for its health benefits and numerous compounds derived from the popular </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Allium</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> plant have been studied for their therapeutic properties. One of these compounds, an organosulfur compound called ajoene (from “ajo”, Spanish for garlic), has been shown to fight fungal infections and may help prevent cancer and cardiovascular disease. In cancer cells, ajoene acts on multiple targets, but few specific targets have been identified. In this study, Kaschula <em>et al.</em> revealed that one of ajoene’s targets is the protein vimentin, a structural protein that is overexpressed in some cancers and contributes to increased tumor invasiveness. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">They found that overexpressing vimentin in cancer cells boosted migration, but exposure to ajoene completely blocked this effect. The authors suggest that ajoene binds to vimentin at a specific cysteine residue, preventing vimentin from forming functional filaments, thus dampening its pro-migratory activity. Interestingly, they also showed that ajoene increases vimentin expression in cancer cells, indicating that ajoene stops filament formation even as new vimentin is produced.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Misuse of antibiotics has propelled the emergence of antibiotic-resistant bacteria, a growing public health issue. Antibiotics are often prescribed to treat respiratory infections like the common cold, but they are not always effective, especially if the infection is caused by a virus. High rates of antibiotic prescribing have been observed in Australia, the UK, and other countries, and can be caused by a number of factors. In this study, Biezen and colleagues interviewed general practitioners (GPs) and parents of young children to see where their views on prescribing antibiotics aligned and where they diverged.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While some of the GPs expressed a perceived lack of understanding by the parents regarding appropriate antibiotic usage, most of the parents had a good understanding of when antibiotics should be used, and their visit to the doctor was primarily for reassurance that their child would recover. Some GPs felt that explaining why antibiotics would not be appropriate or would take too long, and it would be easier to give the patient a prescription if the parent asks for one. Many parents however, said that they trust their GPs’ advice and would want to have these discussions with their GP during the visits. Ultimately, both groups wanted better communication when it came to managing a child’s illness.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Organoids — miniature, three-dimensional versions of an organ — have recently emerged as a promising tool for studying how different organs function, as well as their disease states. The process of making organoids uses stem cells that have been coaxed to assemble into complex three-dimensional structures, given the right growth environment.</span> In this methodology article by Goto-Silva <em>et al.</em>, researchers studied two common methods for generating cerebral organoids and proposed an optimized protocol for reliably producing functional “miniature brains.”</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">An important step in both of the studied protocols is agitating a suspension of stem cells, which affects the mixing of nutrients and the level of shear stress the cells are exposed to. However, these two methods perform this by using either an orbital shaker or a 3D-printed spinning device called the SpinΩ. By testing different conditions and performing computational fluid dynamics analysis, the authors determined that using a standard orbital shaker with their suggested alterations would be both accessible and effective. They also found that after 30 days of cultivation, their organoids produced markers of different regions of the brain, indicating that the stem cells had matured into a range of cell types found in the brain. This suggests that</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> their method could be used for developing models for studying discrete regions of the brain and processes that affect them, and more accurately than was possible before. </span></p>

<p><em>By</em> <a href="https://twitter.com/mattbwarren">Matthew Warren</a></p>
<p>A wealth of research has shown that taking breaks is an important part of learning. Resting straight after acquiring new information <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0956797612441220">seems to improve memory of that information</a>, for example, and <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2016/11/10/for-faster-learning-and-longer-retention-interleave-study-sessions-with-sleep/">sleep is particularly important</a> for consolidating what we have just learned.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Now it seems that even miniscule breaks, just seconds long, are also vital for learning new skills. A <a href="https://www.cell.com/current-biology/fulltext/S0960-9822(19)30219-2">study published recently in <em>Current Biology</em></a> has found that most of the improvement while learning a motor task comes not while actually practicing, but instead during the breaks between practice sessions.</p>
<p><span id="more-37150"></span></p>
<p>To look at the benefits of short breaks during learning, Marlene Bönstrup and colleagues recruited 27 participants to learn a short sequence of key presses. Across 36 trials, each 10 seconds long, the participants repeatedly tapped out the sequence 4-1-3-2-4 as quickly as possible, using four fingers of their left hand. A 10-second rest period separated each trial.</p>
<p>The participants improved drastically across the first 11 trials, increasing their speed from just over 1 key per second to more than 3.5 keys per second. After that their performance plateaued.</p>
<p>But when the researchers looked at how performance improved during these 11 trials, they found that, on average, participants were no faster at the end of each trial than they were at the beginning of that same trial. Instead, improvements were made solely <i>between </i>trials: participants were faster at typing the sequence immediately after a 10-second break than they were just before the break.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>The findings suggest that early improvements when learning a new skill are made “offline”, during periods when the task isn’t actually being performed. This is consistent with past studies highlighting the importance of rest periods in learning, say the authors, albeit on a much shorter timescale. “These results support the idea that the brain opportunistically consolidates previous memories whenever it is not actively learning”, they write.</p>
<p>The team also identified a neural basis for these “offline” improvements. While the participants completed the task, the researchers measured their brain activity using magnetoencephalography (MEG). They found that improvement in performance between trials was related to the amplitude of beta waves (brain waves between 16 and 22Hz): smaller amplitude beta waves in the frontoparietal part of the brain during breaks were associated with greater improvements in performance. Beta wave activity is known to be reduced while people prepare and execute movements, so the authors suggest that this pattern of activity could indicate some kind of reactivation and consolidation of memory related to the task.</p>
<p>The study only looked at performance when people learned a very simple motor task, and it remains to be seen whether short breaks are equally as important when acquiring more complicated skills. But even knowing how to best improve basic motor function could be useful in situations like rehabilitative medicine. “Our ultimate hope is that the results of our experiments will help patients recover from the paralyzing effects caused by strokes and other neurological injuries by informing the strategies they use to ‘relearn’ lost skills,” said senior author Leonardo Cohen in an <a href="https://www.nih.gov/news-events/news-releases/want-learn-new-skill-take-some-short-breaks">accompanying press release</a>.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

<img alt="" class="attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image" height="110" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2019/05/TBA-e1558036820109-140x110.jpg" style="display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;" width="140" /><p>Juliana<a href="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/feed/#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a> was lost in thought. Like her mother, she had learned to support women through pregnancy and childbirth over several years of apprenticeship, delivering at least 400 healthy babies. The women she helped paid her whatever they could afford. But her greatest reward was the satisfaction of successful delivery of a healthy mother and newborn. As a reflection of her track record of success as a service provider and her standing in the community, Juliana had recently been appointed the head of the community women’s association.</p>
<p>Complications after delivery could be harmful to Juliana’s reputation, threatening her livelihood and her standing in the community. This threat was behind Juliana’s worry. In the delivery room lay a mother who was bleeding despite Juliana’s best efforts. A few hundred meters away, in the local clinic, there was a doctor, with supplies and equipment, who might be able to help Juliana’s client. Sending the mother to the clinic immediately was the right choice, one that Juliana had decided to make, but it could come at a personal and social cost.</p>
<h3><strong>Postnatal care – important but rare</strong></h3>
<p>Maternal deaths commonly occur within 48 hours of childbirth, predominantly from severe bleeding, hypertensive diseases, and infections – complications which may arise without warning. Therefore, the <a href="https://www.who.int/maternal_child_adolescent/documents/postnatal-care-recommendations/en/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">World Health Organization recommends</a> that every mother receive postnatal care within 48 hours of delivery, with regular assessments to facilitate early diagnosis, treatment, and referral in the event of complications.</p>
<p>More than six out of ten childbirths in <a href="http://dhsprogram.com/publications/publication-fr293-dhs-final-reports.cfm" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Nigeria</a> are not supported by a skilled health care provider. In most cases, these women turn to a traditional birth attendant (TBA), an informally-trained and community-based provider of pregnancy-related care that works independently of the health system. In Nigeria, less than two in ten mothers who give birth outside the facility, often supported by TBAs, receive postnatal care.</p>
<h3><strong>The role of TBAs</strong></h3>
<p>Our previous <a href="https://bmcpregnancychildbirth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12884-017-1616-x?utm_source=bmc_blogs&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=null&amp;utm_campaign=blog_2019_bmcseriesblog" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">qualitative study</a> indicated that a TBA’s advice influences decision-making by his/her clients, including the choice to visit a health facility. Many TBAs in our study referred their clients for antenatal ultrasound tests and medication. However, they voiced concerns about the reputational risk and potential for client loss if a TBA referred a client to a skilled health worker postnatally, particularly if there were complications following delivery. Our interviews suggested that monetary rewards could potentially offset these reputational costs to the TBA and increase referrals for postnatal care.</p>
<p>In the absence of rigorous studies of the effectiveness of this intervention, we conducted a randomized controlled trial to estimate the impact of individual cash rewards for maternal referrals on postnatal care use among both mothers and their newborns within 48 hours of delivery. The trial enrolled 207 TBAs in Ebonyi State, Nigeria, from communities that had at least one primary health care facility with a health care provider offering postnatal care. We randomized each TBA to the intervention or control group. TBAs in the intervention group received USD 2.00 for every maternal client that attended postnatal care within 48 hours of delivery. Irrespective of their group, all TBAs were informed of the benefits of postnatal care within 48 hours of delivery for maternal and neonatal survival, encouraged to refer their clients within this time window, and offered a reward of USD 0.70 for informing the study team of clients they had supported during delivery.</p>
<h3><strong>Our findings</strong></h3>
<p>We <a href="https://bmcpregnancychildbirth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12884-019-2313-8?utm_source=bmc_blogs&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=null&amp;utm_campaign=blog_2019_bmcseriesblog" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">found </a>that the intervention was successful at increasing postnatal care use. The probability that a maternal client in the intervention group attended postnatal care within 48 hours of delivery was 15.4 percentage points higher than for maternal clients in the control group. Our intervention only rewarded TBAs in the intervention group for referring mothers to postnatal care, however, the intervention also increased postnatal care checks for newborns. In about seven out of ten cases, mothers reported that the TBA’s advice was an important motivation for attending postnatal care for themselves or their newborns (see figure).</p>
<figure class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_11037" style="width: 650px;"><img alt="" class="wp-image-11037 size-large" height="303" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2019/05/TBA2-1024x484.png" width="640" /><div class="attachment-image--caption">Why did you choose to attend postnatal care?</div><div class="attachment-image--source"></div></figure>
<p>Thus, cash incentives to TBAs did increase postnatal care use. Nonetheless, fewer than 20 percent of mothers or newborns in the intervention group received postnatal care within 48 hours of delivery, leaving most clients of TBAs still vulnerable to complications within this critical window. Furthermore, obtaining postnatal care in a health facility from a skilled provider did not guarantee that mothers or their newborns were assessed appropriately, as health providers addressed only 42 percent of recommended actions from the postnatal care guidelines developed by the World Health Organization.</p>
<p>Every mother and her newborn should be supported before, during, and after delivery by a skilled and equipped provider. Where mothers continue to patronize informal providers like Juliana, our study shows that monetary rewards for referrals can link these mothers to skilled care during the postnatal period. Postnatal care can be particularly consequential and lifesaving for these mothers and newborns that do not receive skilled support during pregnancy and delivery. However, for postnatal care to save lives, skilled health care providers must deliver high-quality care. Therefore, where implemented, cash incentives for referrals should be complemented with interventions that address other demand- and supply-side barriers to high-quality, skilled health care.</p>

Twenty-two adult goats were put in four situations: <br /><blockquote class="tr_bq">(1) control (neutral)<br />(2) anticipation of a food reward (positive)<br />(3) food-related frustration (negative)<br />(4) social isolation (negative)</blockquote>Dr. Elodie Briefer and colleagues conducted the study at a goat sanctuary in Kent, UK (<a href="http://www.buttercups.org.uk/" target="_blank">Buttercups Sanctuary for Goats</a>). The caprine participants had lived at the sanctuary for at least two years and were fully habituated to humans. Heart rate and respiration were recorded as indicators of arousal, so this dimension of emotion could be considered separately from valence (positive/negative). For conditions #1-3, the goats were tested in pairs (adjacent pens) to avoid the stress of social isolation. They were habituated to the general set-up, to the Frustration and Isolation scenarios, and to the heart rate monitor before the actual experimental sessions, which were run on separate days. Additional details are presented in the first footnote.<span style="color: purple;"><b><sup>1</sup></b></span><br /><br /><br /><audio controls=""><source src="https://sites.google.com/site/goatvocalization/home/sound/goat%20calls%20%28negative-positive%29.mp3?attredirects=0&amp;d=1" /></audio><br /><br /><br /><span><b><a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0003347214004126#dfig1" title="Audio A1">Audio A1</a>.</b> One call produced during a negative situation (food frustration), followed  by a call produced during a positive situation (food reward) by the same goat (<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0003347214004126" target="_blank">Briefer et al., 2015)</a>.</span><br /><br /><br />Behavioral responses during the scenarios were timed and scored; these included tail position, locomotion, rapid head movement, ear orientation, and number of calls.

Behaviorally speaking, arousal and valence had different indicators: <br /><blockquote class="tr_bq">During high arousal situations, goats displayed more head movements,  moved more, had their ears pointed forwards more often and to the side less often, and produced more calls. ...

I think I would need a lot more training to identify the range of goat emotions conveyed in my amateur video.

In the animal literature, a similar head-orienting response is a standard experimental procedure. For now, we will have to accept the underlying assumption that orienting left or right may be an indicator of a contralateral hemispheric “preference” for that specific vocalization (i.e., orienting to the left side indicates a right hemisphere dominance, and vice versa). <br /><blockquote class="tr_bq">The experimental procedure usually applied to test functional auditory  asymmetries in response to vocalizations of conspecifics and  heterospecifics is based on a major assumption (<a class=" bibr popnode" href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6347058/#zoy022-B45">Teufel et al. 2007</a>; <a class=" bibr popnode tag_hotlink tag_tooltip" href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6347058/#zoy022-B43" id="__tag_746041107">Siniscalchi et al. 2008</a>).  <span style="color: #cc0000;"><b>It is assumed that when a sound is perceived simultaneously in both  ears, the head orientation to either the left or right side is an  indicator of the side of the hemisphere that is primarily involved in the response to the stimulus presented.</b></span> There is strong evidence that  this is the case in humans ... The assumption is  also supported by the neuroanatomic evidence of the contralateral  connection of the auditory pathways in the mammalian brain (<a class=" bibr popnode" href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6347058/#zoy022-B37">Rogers and Andrew 2002</a>; <a class=" bibr popnode tag_hotlink tag_tooltip" href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6347058/#zoy022-B28" id="__tag_746041121">Ocklenburg et al. 2011</a>).</blockquote><br />The experimental set-up to test this in goats is shown below.<br /><br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-veONwSaj_Zk/XN55qA53IKI/AAAAAAAAM1s/jQV5bSRUBoUmvdF225yj-DkAdZZ_H7zZgCLcBGAs/s1600/goat%2Bauditory%2Bperception%2Bexperiment.jpg" style="margin-left: 0em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" data-original-height="426" data-original-width="633" height="268" src="https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-veONwSaj_Zk/XN55qA53IKI/AAAAAAAAM1s/jQV5bSRUBoUmvdF225yj-DkAdZZ_H7zZgCLcBGAs/s400/goat%2Bauditory%2Bperception%2Bexperiment.jpg" width="400" /></a></div><br /><span>A feeding bowl (</span><span>filled with a tasty mixture of dry pasta and hay) was fixed at the center of the arena opposite to the entrance.

Three examples of each vocalization were played, each from a different and unfamiliar goat (or dog).<br /><br />The various theories of brain lateralization of emotion predicted different results. The <b>right hemisphere model </b>predicts right hemisphere dominance (head turn to the left) for high-arousal emotion regardless of valence (food anticipation, food frustration, dog barks). In contrast, the <b>valence model</b> predicts right hemisphere dominance for processing negative emotions (food frustration, isolation, dog barks), and left hemisphere dominance for positive emotions (food anticipation). The <b>conspecific model</b> predicts left hemisphere dominance for all goat calls (“familiar and non-threatening”) and right hemisphere dominance for dog barks. Finally, a <b>general emotion model</b> predicts right hemisphere dominance for all of the vocalizations, because they're all emotion-laden.<br /><br />The results sort of supported the <b>conspecific model</b> (according to the authors), if we now accept that dog barks are actually “familiar and non-threatening” [<i>if I understand correctly</i>]. The head-orienting response did not differ significantly between the four vocalizations, and there was a slight bias for head orienting to the right (p=.046 vs. chance level), when collapsed across all stimulus types.<span style="color: purple;"><b><sup> 2</sup></b></span> <br /><br />The time to resume feeding after hearing a vocalization (a measure of fear) didn't differ between goat calls and dog barks, so the authors concluded that “goats at our study site may have been habituated to dog barks and that they did not perceive dog barks as a serious threat.” However, if a Siberian Husky breaks free of its owner and runs around a fenced-in rent-a-goat herd, chaos may ensue.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><b>Footnotes</b><br /><br /><span style="color: purple;"><b><sup>1</sup></b></span> Methodological details:<br /><blockquote class="tr_bq">“(1) During the control situation, goats were left unmanipulated in a pen with hay (‘Control’).

(3) After goats had been tested with the Feeding situation, they were tested with a food frustration situation. This consisted of giving food to only one of the goats in the pair and not to the subject (‘Frustration’).

<p>What if you could take a psychedelic drug regularly in such tiny quantities that the immediate effects were not discernible, yet over time it led to a range of psychological benefits, especially enhanced focus and heightened creativity? That’s the principle behind “microdosing” – a controversial technique that’s exploded in popularity ever since the publication of a 2011 book <em>The Psychedelic Explorers Guide</em> and a 2015 Rolling Stone article titled <em>How LSD Microdosing Became The Hot New Business Trip</em>. Large online communities of microdosing enthusiasts have since emerged on sites like Reddit, where dosing tips are shared and the supposed manifold benefits of the practice are espoused.</p>
<p>However, actual scientific investigations into the effects of microdosing can be counted on one hand. Earlier this year, <em>PLOS One</em> published <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0211023#sec003">one of the few systematic investigations ever conducted into the practice</a>, by Vince Polito and Richard Stevenson at Macquarie University. Though exploratory and tentative due to “legal and bureaucratic” obstacles (meaning there was no placebo control or randomisation in this research), the results suggest that microdosing can be beneficial, although not in the ways that users most expect, and not necessarily for everyone.</p>
<p><span id="more-37159"></span></p>
<p>The researchers recruited hundreds of volunteers from Reddit.com/r/microdosing and other online psychedelic groups (people with mental health problems were asked not to take part). The participants completed a comprehensive battery of questionnaires at baseline tapping nine domains of functioning including personality, mental health and wellbeing; then for six weeks they reported daily any microdosing they’d engaged in the previous day, and provided brief daily ratings (of how they’d felt the previous day) regarding various psychological measures. Finally, at the study end, they completed the same battery of tests as at baseline.</p>
<p>Sufficiently complete data was obtained from 63 mentally well participants who, during the study, engaged in microdosing of a serotonergic psychedelic (a substance, most commonly LSD or magic mushrooms/psilocybin, that acts on the functioning of the brain chemical serotonin).</p>
<p>In terms of the daily ratings, on days that participants had microdosed, they scored higher than usual across all the measures: connectedness, contemplation, creativity, focus, happiness, productiveness, and wellbeing. However, only focus and productivity showed slight, sustained increases on the drug-free days that followed microdosing. “The pattern of results here is somewhat inconsistent with narrative accounts that claim that the effects of microdosing linger for multiple days,” the researchers said.</p>
<p>On most of the more in-depth battery of measures taken at the study start and end, participants did not show any change. However, they did display reductions in stress, depression and mind-wandering, alongside greater absorption (experiencing intense imaginative experiences and “peak-like altered states of consciousness”). A final change that surprised the researchers was a slight increase in trait neuroticism (i.e. greater emotional instability), which they speculated may have been due to an overall increase in emotional intensity, positive and negative.</p>
<p>That last finding regarding increased neuroticism was reflected in some of the participants’ open-ended descriptions at the study debrief: “<em>…another negative is that all emotions get amplified. So whenever I feel down or not loved the microdose makes it even harder,</em>” wrote one volunteer.</p>
<p>A major drawback of a study such as this, in which participants knew which substance they had taken and there was no placebo group, is that the reported effects may simply have been a result of participants’ expectations or their imagination. To gain insight into this possibility, the researchers conducted a second study with hundreds more participants from online microdosing communities, and this time asked them to say how they thought they would change on the same various psychological measures used in the first study, if they were to microdose for six weeks.</p>
<p>In contrast with the first study’s results, these participants predicted that after six weeks microdosing they would change on all the psychological measures. Although most of their predictions were for change in the same direction as the limited changes that were actually observed in the first study, these participants’ strongest predictions were for increases in creativity, wellbeing and mindfulness (in line with the positive media coverage of microdosing and generally positive chat in online forums), but in fact none of these variables increased over the course of the first study. Also, these participants predicted that neuroticism would decrease, when it actually increased.</p>
<p>The fact that the predictions of participants in the second study did not match the actual reported experiences of those in the first, argues against the experiences of the first group of participants being driven purely by their expectations and hopes. The mostly positive effects reported also chime with the findings from more controlled research of larger doses of psychedelics, which have mostly been positive. However, the researchers also noted that they did not observe a dose-response effect in the first study (there was no correlation between the doses the participants reported taking and the psychological effects), which is surprising, and “is a reason to interpret these findings cautiously,” they said.</p>
<p>Overall, Polito and Stevenson said their tentative findings suggested several “disconnects” between media coverage and anecdotal chat around the effects of microdosing and actual experiences of microdosers as recorded systematically in this research. In particular, effects mostly did not seem to linger on non-dosing days, and the main changes over the course of the study were not in productivity and creativity as is commonly claimed, but “mainly involved reduced mental distress and changes in constructs such as absorption and mind wandering that are not as commonly discussed”.</p>
<p>The researchers said that their “most surprising” finding was the observed increase in neuroticism, especially considered in light of the handful of open-ended descriptions of negative experiences. “In a context of considerable hype around the practice of microdosing, particularly with regards to its potential as a business tool, it is important to acknowledge that microdosing may not be universally beneficial,” the researchers said.</p>

<h2>Most scholars agree on three facts about the teenage brain.</h2>
<ol>
<li>Brain structures continue to change between childhood and adulthood. Grey matter volume peaks at puberty then declines throughout adolescence and into the twenties. White matter volume increases throughout childhood, adolescence and into adulthood.</li>
<li>Girls’ brains mature slightly faster than boys’. This sex difference in brain development is in sync with physical development where, on average, girls enter puberty a year or two before boys, who then quickly catch up.</li>
<li>Different brain regions mature at different rates. Development of the limbic system, which drives emotions, speeds up at puberty, but the PFC, which is involved in thinking and judgement, doesn’t mature until our twenties. This causes a ‘developmental mismatch’ between emotion and reward processing, and thinking and judgement. The mismatch determines aspects of teenage behaviour such as being overly emotional, impulsive and hypersensitive to social situations.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Grey matter thins as connections are refined</h2>
<p>The prefrontal cortex, as its name suggests, sits at the front of the brain and is sometimes called the brain’s CEO because it acts as a wise leader, exerting top-down control over other brain areas. The PFC is involved in emotion regulation, judgement, strategy, impulse control, attention, working memory and social cognition – navigating complex social relationships such as discerning friend from ‘frenemy’ from foe.</p>
<p>During childhood, the grey matter of the PFC continues to thicken as neurons make new synapses, much like a tree growing extra branches, twigs and roots. During the teens, thinning occurs across much of the cortex but is most obvious in the PFC.</p>
<p>Loss or thinning of grey matter always sounds unhealthy, but as is often the case with the brain, less is more. Grey matter loss is vitally important and is due to pruning away of unwanted ‘twigs and branches’, which partly depends on experience in a ‘use it or lose it’ manner. Connections that are being used are strengthened and those that aren’t being used are pruned away.</p>

<h2>More white matter enables faster communication</h2>
<p>MRI scans have revealed ever-increasing volumes of white matter in the tracts leading to and from the PFC during adolescence. Recall that axons are insulated by myelin, which speeds up signalling between brain regions. Myelinated axons transmit impulses up to 100 times faster than unmyelinated axons, and faster transmission means faster mental processing.</p>
<p>Jay Giedd, a neuroscientist at the University of California, San Diego, has found that increased white matter means the connections between brain regions become stronger and more numerous. The brain matures by becoming more interconnected and more specialised.</p>
<p>To use Giedd’s metaphor, brain maturation is not so much a matter of adding new letters to the alphabet but one of combining existing letters into words, words into sentences and sentences into paragraphs.</p>
<blockquote><p>‘These changes ultimately help the brain to specialise in everything from complex thinking to being socially adept.’</p></blockquote>
<h2>Subcortical brain areas shrink and grow</h2>
<p>Changes to white and grey matter structure are not restricted to the PFC. Subcortical brain structures start to mature right around puberty, and development is more or less complete by the mid-teenage years.</p>
<p>Subcortical brain regions are those deep inside the brain under (‘sub’) the cortex in the frontal and temporal lobes. They include the limbic system (hippocampus and amygdala), and the corpus striatum, which is made up of four parts: nucleus accumbens, caudate, putamen and globus pallidus. They’re connected to the PFC and to each other by bundles of axons.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="page" title="Page 122">
<div class="layoutArea">
<div class="column">
<p>In girls, the amygdala and hippocampus get bigger during puberty. At the same time, the four structures making up the corpus striatum all shrink. Maturation of subcortical structures is fastest in late childhood and early adolescence but the rate of growth or shrinkage slows right down after age sixteen.</p>
</div>

<h2>Teenage girls can be very emotional (no kidding!).</h2>
<p>But not all teenage girls experience ‘storm and stress’. When I was seventeen, my levels of anxiety during final-year high-school exams were so out of control I ended up at the family GP being treated for panic attacks. But the vast majority of my teen years were joyful, empowering and a whole lot of fun.</p>
<p>Sarah Whittle is an associate professor of psychiatry at the University of Melbourne, where she specialises in adolescent brain development and resilience. Whittle explained to me that the emotional lives of teenage girls differ from adults because of the ‘developmental mismatch’ between their <em>‘rational PFC’</em> and <em>‘emotional limbic brain’</em>.</p>
<blockquote><p>It’s still only a theory, but the evidence is stacking up that hyperactivity of the limbic system is responsible for heightened emotional reactivity in adolescents. As the PFC matures, its ability to regulate the activity in subcortical structures improves.</p></blockquote>

<h2>Learning to regulate emotions is a vital skill to learn in adolescence</h2>
<p>Being able to calmly assess and keep emotions in check is a crucial life skill. Emotional regulation lets us navigate changing social landscapes and foster mental wellbeing. One of the most effective ways to regulate your emotions is a technique called cognitive reappraisal. Cognitive reappraisal changes the way you interpret a situation, which in turn calms your hot-headed response.</p>
<p>Imagine you’re fourteen and walking up to the front door of a party. Inside you can hear all your girlfriends laughing hysterically. Your appraisal of the situation might be, <em>‘OMG! They’re laughing about me behind my back.’</em> That appraisal (correct or not) will likely trigger intense feelings of sadness and rejection, and might quickly be followed by the thought, <em>‘They hate me. I’m going home!’</em></p>
<p>A different way of thinking about the situation – the reappraisal – might be, <em>‘Sure, they’re laughing. Perhaps someone told a funny joke. Maybe I should go inside and find out.’</em> The reappraisal (correct or not) encourages you to consider different perspectives and leads to a way of thinking that keeps a lid on emotional distress.</p>
<h2>Adults are much better at cognitive reappraisal than children and teens.</h2>
<p>We’re more experienced with a range of social situations and better at deploying the thinking skills required.</p>
<p>The neural basis of cognitive reappraisal is studied by eliciting negative emotions with provocative or distressing photos comprised of images that range from neutral (furniture or landscapes) to horrific or exciting scenes (mutilated bodies or erotic nudes).</p>
<p>Whittle’s research shows that teenage girls find the photos much more emotionally disturbing or arousing than adults. In her lab, fMRI shows that deploying the skill of cognitive reappraisal activates a distributed cortical network including the PFC, which in turn down-regulates excitability in the limbic system.</p>

<div class="layoutArea">
<div class="column">
<h2>Emotional regulation skills don’t always magically appear as we mature, but they can be formally taught.</h2>
<p>Whittle coaches her teenage volunteers in cognitive reappraisal by encouraging them to think, <em>‘This isn’t real, it’s a scene from a movie’,</em> or, ‘The situation looks worse than it is’, or, <em>‘It could be a lot worse’, or, ‘At least it is not me in that situation’.</em></p>

<h2>Is mental illness emotional development gone wrong?</h2>
<p>One theme in adolescent brain research can be summed up by the phrase ‘moving parts get broken’. Because the teenage brain is undergoing such extensive remodelling, it’s thought that it’s easy for the wiring to go awry, predisposing girls to depression, anxiety and eating disorders.</p>
<p>The emotional life of teenage girls is complex both inside and out. It’s clear that ‘inside’ hormones are fluctuating and neural networks are fine-tuning. But we tend to forget the dynamic shifts taking place ‘outside’.</p>
<h2>Many emotions girls experience are novel</h2>
<p>Especially those taking place in new social contexts. There is a first time for everything and that includes your first crush (especially if it’s unrequited), experience of jealousy, being left off the party invite list, and getting likes on Instagram. The newness of these experiences heightens their emotional impact. Sometimes this is positive – falling in love for the first time is pretty wonderful! Sometimes this is negative – being rejected by your first love is rather painful.</p>

<h2>Girls’ preference for emotional intimacy increases during their early teenage years.</h2>
<p>Intense ‘bosom buddy’ friendships form around the same time girls ‘break up’ with their families. This leaves girls potentially vulnerable if those friendships break down or are less than ideal. Loss of friendship is a significant and overlooked potential cause of stress.</p>
<p>While the ‘wrong’ friendships can lead teens astray, the ‘right’ kinds of friends are powerful and protective. I had one such dear friend all through high school (we’re still close now and I’ve called on her psychiatric training to inform sections of this book). While writing this chapter we talked about how our devoted friendship buffered us from the tumult so many of our peers experienced. We know the happiest teens aren’t the ones who have the most ‘friends’ on Instagram but the ones who have a few close supportive friendships, and sometimes that means having one terrific friend.</p>

Tayarani-N., M.-R. Akbarzadeh-T, 2014)</a>"</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>A novel optimization algorithm, called the Magnetic Optimization Algorithms (MOAs), is proposed in this paper which is inspired by the principles of magnetic field theory. In MOA, the possible solutions are some magnetic particles scattered in the search space. In this respect, each magnetic particle has a measure of mass and magnetic field according to its fitness. In this scheme, the fitter magnetic particles are more massive, with stronger magnetic field. In terms of interaction, these particles are located in a structured population and apply a long range force of attraction to their neighbors. Ten different structures are proposed for the algorithm and the structure that offers the best performance is found. Also, to improve the exploration ability of the algorithm, several operators are proposed: a repulsive short-range force, an explosion operator, a combination of short-range force and explosion operator and a crossover interaction between the neighboring particles. In order to test the proposed algorithm and the proposed operators, the algorithm is compared with a variety of existing algorithms on 21 numerical benchmark functions. The experimental results suggest that the proposed algorithm outperforms some of the existing algorithms.</p>

<hr class="docutils" />
<p>The field of Functional Data Analysis (FDA) has seen rapid development over the last two decades. FDA refers to a collection of methods for analysing data over a curve, surface or continuum. It is very much involved with computational statistics. FDA has been applied to quite broadly in medicine, business and engineering.</p>
<p>In this talk, Yi will introduce the basic idea of FDA using a case study presented in the paper: zooming in on human growth.</p>
<p>“Human growth is not at all the simple process that one might imagine at first sight… Collecting records is time-consuming and expensive, because children have to be measured accurately and tracked for a long period of their lives.</p>
<p>[We] consider how to make this sort of record into a useful functional datum to incorporate into further analyses. A smooth curve drawn through the points is commonly called a growth curve, but growth is actually the rate of increase of the height of the child. In children this is necessarily positive… [We] develop a monotone smoothing method that takes this sort of consideration into account and yields a functional datum that picks out important stages in a child’s growth."</p>

Retraction Watch readers may have noticed what seems like a growing trend: Co-first authorships. While the move might seem like a way to promote equality, some researchers are worried that it’s having the opposite effect. In response, the Journal of Clinical Investigation (JCI) recently created additional requirements for shared first authorship. We asked Arturo Casadevall, … <a class="more-link" href="http://retractionwatch.com/2019/05/16/sharing-the-coin-of-the-realm-how-one-journal-hopes-new-authorship-rules-will-cut-down-on-bias/">Continue reading <span class="screen-reader-text">Sharing the coin of the realm: How one journal hopes new authorship rules will cut down on bias</span></a>

<p>It’s well known that science has a diversity problem, with <a href="http://uis.unesco.org/en/topic/women-science">women</a> and <a href="https://www.pewsocialtrends.org/2018/01/09/blacks-in-stem-jobs-are-especially-concerned-about-diversity-and-discrimination-in-the-workplace/">members of minority groups</a> being underrepresented. A new study suggests a solution aimed at children – reframing science as something that people do, rather than something that defines their identity, can reduce the potentially off-putting impact of the <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/tea.21231">“white male” scientist stereotype</a>.</p>
<p>According to the paper, <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/desc.12837">published recently in <i>Developmental Science</i></a>, thoughtful use of language encourages greater interest in science among young children – and makes them less likely to lose confidence in their scientific abilities as they grow up.</p>
<p><span id="more-37148"></span></p>
<p>Ryan Lei and colleagues recruited 212 children in 2<sup>nd</sup> and 3<sup>rd</sup> grade (about 7-9 years old) at two diverse publicly funded schools in New York City. The kids were randomly assigned to one of two groups: one group always received “identity-focused” language about science (that implied that<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>scientists are a specific category of people), while the other always received “action-focused” language (that implied science is an activity that anyone can do).<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>For instance, at the beginning of the study the kids saw a video that introduced them to the scientific process. For the identity-focused group, the narrator of the video used phrases like “scientists make thoughtful guesses to help them learn about the world”. The action-focused group, on the other hand, heard language like “when people do science, they make thoughtful guesses to help them learn about the world”.</p>
<p>At three points across the academic year, the children answered questions measuring their attitudes towards science, including their levels of interest (either how much they wanted to “be a scientist” or “do science”, depending on the group they were in), and how good they thought they’d be (either at “being a scientist” or “doing science”). At the second and third testing points, they were also asked to judge how many parents of other children at school “were scientists” or “did science”.</p>
<p>Overall, the children in the action-focused group had a greater interest in “doing science” than those in the identity-focussed group had in “being a scientist”. The action-focused group also rated themselves higher in their scientific abilities, and they thought that more adults “did science” compared with how many people the identity group thought “were scientists”.</p>
<p>Across the year, as the children got older, their interest in science and belief in their own abilities decreased. But the kind of language they had received was important: children in the action-focused group didn’t show a decrease in self-belief, unlike the children in the identity-focused group. In part, this effect seemed to be because the action group believed more adults in their community were doing science. “The benefit of action‐focused language partly occurred because children have more inclusive representations of who they think can ‘do science’ than of who can ‘be a scientist’”, write the authors.</p>
<p>The results suggest that language can have a big impact on how kids’ views of science develop through childhood. This is important, say the authors, because in schools and the media labels like “scientist” are common. The study suggests that teachers should reframe discussions to talk about “doing science” instead.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>This careful use of language could be particularly useful to encourage interest in science amongst those who might not see themselves as fitting the stereotype of a scientist – although interestingly, a supplementary analysis didn’t actually find any differences in the effect of the action/identity framing between boys and girls, or those of different ethnic backgrounds. The authors suggest the study may have too few participants to detect those kinds of differences – this is an important area for future, larger studies to consider.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

<img alt="" class="attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image" height="110" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2019/05/AR-nursing-140x110.jpg" style="display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;" width="140" /><p><strong>Augmented Reality</strong></p>
<p>In recent years, there has been an increase in the development of innovative digital technology, including Augmented Reality (AR). AR is the overlaying of virtual content on a user’s view of the real world. <a href="http://mkwi2018.leuphana.de/wp-content/uploads/MKWI_219.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Cases</a> supporting the use of AR smart glasses exist if an application is needed to be timely, mobile, and hands-free and continuous attention on the task is necessary. For example, in maintenance a worker could use a smart glass with a live-streaming feature to get advice of technicians, including watching demonstrations, while doing the work. Because of the novelty of AR applications, we find ourselves at an interesting waypoint in the process of finding further use cases for AR.</p>
<p><strong>Why think about Augmented Reality in nursing?</strong></p>
<p>Nursing is an interesting field in which to apply AR, as nurses often have to work quickly, stay mobile, and have both their hands available for their work. Furthermore, new challenges in the nursing field, such as demographical change and rising multimorbidity, invite the use of new technologies. Technical solutions and social innovation may improve healthcare; however, it is important to take the special circumstances of care workers into consideration.</p>
<p>Overviews regarding use cases of AR have been published for various fields. As there was no systematic review about AR in nursing, it was the logical step to conduct this work ourselves. With the review we aimed to gain insights to the following research question:</p>
<p><em>To date, what research has been performed regarding the use of AR in nursing?</em></p>
<p><strong>Methodical challenges</strong></p>
<p>As we had a broad research question without concrete output categories, in the beginning we were not able to conduct a systematic review. Thus, we started looking for a type of review which allowed identifying relevant result categories during the process.</p>
<blockquote><p>New use cases for AR in nursing … will need to be evaluated with a focus on added value first and impact afterwards.</p></blockquote>
<p>Furthermore, addressing the study quality was a challenging task. To date only a few studies on AR in nursing exist. Therefore, we decided to include studies of varying quality. Finally, we decided to conduct a scoping review. This review type allows the kinds of freedom we needed to identify relevant topics.</p>
<p>As we followed the guidelines for scoping reviews, we still faced the task of identifying relevant topics inductively. To get an overview about topics mentioned in the studies we used a mindmap.</p>
<p><strong>What did we find?</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://bmcnurs.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12912-019-0342-2?utm_source=bmc_blogs&amp;amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;amp;utm_content=null&amp;amp;utm_campaign=blog_2019_bmcseriesblog" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">We found</a> 23 studies identifying use cases for AR in nursing. Use cases for AR in nursing focus on specific fields of use, and use case identification and requirements elicitation were often not described in detail. In addition, we identified that the results of studies evaluating AR in nursing were predominantly positive; however, several technical challenges were described for most of these devices. Moreover, most applications could be identified as prototypes in an early stage of implementation.</p>
<p>The settings in which the studies operated are noteworthy. While twelve studies could be grouped into a broad clinical setting with variation in use cases, eleven studies were set in the field of nursing education. We found that many studies focused on obtaining knowledge on the applications developed instead of the effects of technology inclusion on nursing. No studies questioned the clinical relevance of their results.</p>
<p>Considering context while evaluating applications would be an important goal for future research. This could be achieved through performing field trials.</p>
<p>For future development trends, we infer that further technological advances will lead to new use cases for AR in nursing. These may be developed rapidly and will need to be evaluated with a focus on added value first and impact afterwards.</p>
<p><strong>How did we use the findings?</strong></p>
<p>As part of a <a href="http://arinflex.de" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">consortium project</a>, we had the aim to develop applications of AR in nursing. Thus, we needed an overview regarding existing developments. We have already used the results of our review, along with additional <a href="http://ebooks.iospress.nl/publication/48266" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">workshops</a>, to design and evaluate prototypes for applications in the fields of <a href="http://ebooks.iospress.nl/publication/50054" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">wound care management</a>, <a href="https://cora.ucc.ie/handle/10468/4438" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">hand hygiene</a>, and education.</p>

Benjamin Bonavida is a prolific science book author and recently retired as UCLA professor. He previously had to retract some papers as others took the blame. Yet Smut Clyde found so many fraudulent works signed by Bonavida that one wonders if this cancer researcher is a victim or rather the perpetrator here.

<p><em>You’ve been transported deep beneath the earth into a labyrinth of tunnels. You have a sword and a communications device, and your objective is to return to the surface. A figure appears in the dark ahead of you. Do you: (a) Use your communication device to say hello; (b) Formulate a contingency plan for escape and then approach the figure; or (c) Pause a moment to try to read its body language before stepping forward to approach the figure? </em>[to interpret your preference, see end of post]</p>
<p>Personality traits are traits are traditionally assessed by asking people to rate how much various descriptive statements match their own personality, like “I enjoy talking to strangers”. This cheap and easy approach has enjoyed great success – people’s scores on such tests tend to be impressively consistent over time, and they predict important outcomes from health to career success. However, the questionnaires are far from perfect. Research volunteers might not properly engage out of boredom, for instance. Job candidates might deliberately fake their scores to give a favourable impression.</p>
<p>An exciting possibility for overcoming these issues, according to a <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0191886919301266?dgcid=raven_sd_via_email">new paper</a> in <em>Personality and Individual Differences</em> is to use a “gamification” approach – present people with behavioural options in engaging game-like scenarios and deduce their personality traits from their choices.</p>
<p><span id="more-37137"></span></p>
<p>To test the gamification approach to personality testing, John-Luke McCord at Louisiana State University and his colleagues consulted 11 personality psychology experts to help develop their tunnel-based game scenario. They ended up with 27 choice situations with the various options carefully worded to reflect the likely preferences of high scorers in the main “Big Five” personality traits (extraversion, conscientiousness, neuroticism, openness, and agreeableness).</p>
<p>The team then recruited 77 volunteers on Reddit (r/SampleSize) and had them work their way through the game and also complete an established questionnaire based method of assessing the Big Five traits, the IPIP-50. Based on the results, they tweaked the game and in a follow-up study gave the revised version to 98 undergrads, who also took the IPIP-50.</p>
<p>Combining results from these two studies showed that participants’ trait scores based on their game choices correlated moderately with their trait scores as ascertained from the established personality questionnaire. This was true for all five main traits, with the correlation being weakest for openness (correlation was 0.14) and highest for extraversion (0.41).</p>
<p>Finally, the team tried to obtain higher correlations between the game scores and questionnaire scores by trying out a new version of the game with more Reddit volunteers, this time with the choice options in each scenario worded to reflect different levels of one specific trait (more or less extraversion, for instance, rather than interpreting the choices as reflecting the influence of different traits). The game scores correlated with the questionnaire scores for all traits, except conscientiousness, perhaps because all players, regardless of their own personality, recognised the most conscientious option as optimal.</p>
<p>On reflection, however, McCord and his team said that perhaps they were barking up the wrong tree by trying to make the game and questionnaire results correlate as highly as possible, “as the ultimate goal is to accurately measure personality, not perfectly reflect an existing measure.” As their core motivation is to create a more realistic measure of personality (and especially personality-driven decision making), they added that it might be better to evaluate their game “with field studies or naturalistic observations”.</p>
<p>This paper was intended as a proof of concept, which the researchers believe they’ve achieved. Further refinement and a more technologically complex game could provide an even more accurate and realistic way to measure personality. “We believe that the future of game-like personality testing has promising potential for both research and practice,” the researchers said.</p>

<p><strong>Interpreting the scenario options</strong>: The researchers say that choosing (a) would indicate higher trait extraversion; choosing (b) would indicate higher trait conscientiousness; and (c) would be taken as a sign of openness.

<p>Long-term depression at parallel fiber-Purkinje cell synapses plays a principal role in learning in the cerebellum, which acts as a supervised learning machine. Recent experiments demonstrate various forms of synaptic plasticity at different sites within the cerebellum. In this article, we take into consideration synaptic plasticity at parallel fiber-molecular layer interneuron synapses as well as at parallel fiber-Purkinje cell synapses, and propose that the cerebellar cortex performs reinforcement learning, another form of learning that is more capable than supervised learning. We posit that through the use of reinforcement learning, the need for explicit teacher signals for learning in the cerebellum is eliminated; instead, learning can occur via responses from evaluative feedback. We demonstrate the learning capacity of cerebellar reinforcement learning using simple computer simulations of delay eyeblink conditioning and the cart-pole balancing task.</p>

<p>You spend about 10 per cent of your waking hours with your eyes shut, simply because of blinking. Every few seconds, each time you blink, your retinas are deprived of visual input for a period lasting anywhere between tens to hundreds of milliseconds (500 milliseconds is equivalent to half a second). You don’t usually notice this, because your brain suppresses the dark spells and stitches together the bursts of visual information seamlessly. But these dips in visual processing in the brain do have an impact: a <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0956797619842198">new study</a> in <i>Psychological Science</i> finds that, in an important way, they cause your sense of the passing of time to stop temporarily.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><span id="more-37130"></span></p>
<p>Exactly how we perceive the passing of time has not been established, and just how important ongoing sensory processing might be is debated. The new work confirms that visual processing has an influence. “In finding that we lose time when we blink, we essentially can draw a link between early ongoing visual processing and the sense of time,” says Ayelet Landau at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, senior author on the study.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Laundau and her colleagues, including first author Shany Grossman at the Weizmann Institute of Science, recruited 22 participant to complete a visual challenge, while 23 others completed an auditory task.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Before the visual challenge started, the participants were first shown a white circle for either a “short” period (0.6 seconds) or a “long” period (2.8 seconds). Then came the actual challenge – they were shown a white circle on a screen for varying periods of time, and asked to judge whether the duration of each appearance was closer to the “short” or “long” period. The participants in the auditory group took part in a similar challenge, except that they had to judge the durations of bursts of white noise. For both groups, a video-based eye tracker continuously measured their eye position and pupil diameter throughout the tasks.</p>
<p>The participants’ judgments during the visual task showed how blinks affect our sense of time. Specifically, participants underestimated the duration of the white circle’s appearance if they blinked while they were watching it. What’s more, for each individual, the duration of this blink correlated with their degree of time under-estimation. There was, as the researchers write, “a proportional relation between the objective duration of sensory-input loss and the loss of subjective time.” These results, they go on, can be interpreted as “supporting a central role for ongoing sensory encoding in the subjective sense of time.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>For the auditory group, in contrast, blinking had no impact on their judgements of noise durations.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>In the real world, we often use many senses to process what’s going on. If we’re watching someone talking while listening to them, for example, would blinking have any effect on our perception of how long they spoke for? This kind of work has yet to be done. “One possibility is that during periods of missing information from one sense, only information flow in the other sense will take over our sense of time,” Landau suggests. “Another option is that if one sense is more highly weighted by the brain — as is the case for vision in watching a person speak — subjective time will rely primarily on this sense and will therefore be distorted by information loss in this sense.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>The study raises all kinds of fascinating questions for future research to investigate. Right now, I’m sitting at my desk, focusing on my computer screen — relying heavily on vision. Yes, I’m absorbed in what I’m doing. But is one reason why time seems to go more quickly when I’m working because my blinks are affecting my judgements of time passing, but when I’m outside, hanging out with my kids, other types of sensory input are preventing or counteracting the time-compressing blink-effect?<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>The research team is currently planning studies to investigate how multi-sensory processing impacts subjective time — so watch this space. But, “we would expect subjective time to be primarily informed by the sense we are [currently] focusing on,” Landau says.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>One final note: other ingenious studies have shown that it’s not the lack of stimulation of the retina, per se, that will alter time perception, but rather the dampening of activity in the visual cortex – a process triggered automatically by involuntary blinking (and which contributes to our seamless visual experience). This means that, should you wish to suspend time deliberately, opening and closing your eyes on purpose will not have the desired effect.</p>

Irina Stancheva was investigated in Edinburgh for fraud at least twice, in 2009 and 2017, yet retraction and correction decisions were not implemented. Apparently to protect the reputation of  Nobel Prize candidate Sir Adrian Bird and  his male mentees, primarily Richard Meehan. One wonders: how much of Bird research in past two decades was actually fabricated by Stancheva?

<p><em>By guest blogger</em> <a href="https://forbiddenpsychology.wordpress.com/">Tomasz Witkowski</a></p>
<p>Looking at the latest epidemiological data, it could be argued that we are in the midst of a pandemic of mental illness, of dimensions never before seen in human history. The WHO estimates that over 350 million people around the world are presently suffering from depression, which constitutes almost 5-6 per cent of the population. At its extreme, depression may lead to suicide, by which it is estimated that around 1 million people die every year. And the numbers continue growing. Faced with this rising tide of illness, it is impossible to overestimate the importance of hard facts and data indicating the paths researchers and clinicians may follow in search of ways to help. Sometimes, as suggested by a <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2017/01/23/after-half-a-century-of-research-psychology-cant-predict-suicidal-behaviours-better-than-by-coin-flip/">meta-analysis of 50 years of studies on indicators that help predict suicide attempts</a>, we are entirely helpless. In other cases, like with the recent <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2018/11/06/this-is-how-psychotherapy-for-depression-changes-the-brain/">meta-analysis of the neural correlates of the changes brought about by psychotherapy in depressed brains</a>, study results do bring us hope.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>The results of the first <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0149763419300247">systematic review and meta-analysis of biological markers evaluated in randomized trials of psychological treatments for depression</a> in <i>Neuroscience and Biobehavioral Reviews</i> are another attempt at understanding methods of treating this terrifying illness. The authors – Ioana A. Cristea, Eirini Karyotaki, Steven D. Hollon, Pim Cuijpers and Claudio Gentili – quite rightly point out that understanding how psychological interventions impact or are impacted by biological variables has important implications. For many people, their depression co-occurs with a bodily illness, such as cancer, diabetes, heart disease, and immune system and neurological disorders, and at times is a consequence of that illness. Although we still know little about the reciprocal cause-and-effect mechanisms between psychic and somatic symptoms, some studies have suggested that psychological interventions not only change mood, but also normalise the functioning of the autonomic nervous system, with a therapeutic effect on physical conditions, such as heart disease. But is this really true?</p>
<p><span id="more-37124"></span></p>
<p>The authors analysed fifty-one trials (5,123 adult participants; over half with a somatic disorder alongside depression) where biological markers such as glycemic control, cortisol concentration after-wake, immunological, neurobiological, inflammatory, weight and blood pressure were outcomes (in 43 studies) and/or predictors of treatment response (9 studies). In fact, only one-fifth of the trials reported statistically significant physiological benefits of a psychological intervention over control, and where present, such benefits were restricted to a tiny fraction of the total variables assessed. Although statistically significant, these limited positive effects were very weak. For measures related to glycemic control and cortisol concentration, psychotherapy did not outperform the controls at all.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>The results contradict the broadly held belief that psychotherapy impacts biology. There may be many reasons for this contradiction, but a likely one is that the belief came about on the basis of purely observational evidence (the effectiveness of psychotherapy in depression is measured almost exclusively with patients’ self-reports or clinician-rated scales, assessing symptoms or other subjective outcomes, and it’s possible these subjective ratings have given an exaggerated impression of the biological impact of psychotherapy).<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>The authors believe their failure to uncover evidence for psychotherapy having biological effects is most likely due primarily to methodological inconsistencies between studies (there was large variability across the biological domains and markers explored and overall findings were mixed), or to the confounding factors, such as placebo effects, that are so characteristic of studies on the biology of psychological illness. If they are correct, then in time, once researchers solidify their methodology, this will deliver new results that confirm the general belief in the beneficial effect of psychotherapy on disruptions to human biological functioning. However, if the researchers’ explanation is untrue, then the results of their new meta-analysis give rise to very fundamental doubts and questions: Is the dogma of psychophysical unity, presently accepted in contemporary psychology and medicine, correct? Is it possible that any associations which occur are of a solely unidirectional nature (biology modifies our mental states, but not the reverse)? And finally, perhaps the most banal question that would render the others meaningless: is it possible that the belief in psychotherapy’s capacity to alter biological functions in our bodies is nothing more than the product of marketing and hype?<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>In seeking the answers to these questions, it is worth examining the manner in which particular types of psychotherapy came about. Were they created and modified on the basis of analysis of feedback (such as biomarkers) supplied by patients’ bodies? And if not, perhaps the issue is not with the methodological imperfections of studies looking for biological effects, but rather in the ways that psychotherapies are developed? To find answers to these questions, we have to analyse the methods that are used to shape psychotherapeutic interventions in the first place.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To many, the statement </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Religion causes violence” seems intuitively true. After all, one can easily summon to mind a huge number of examples, from the Crusades to warfare connected with early Islam, to the September 11th attacks and sectarian warfare in the Middle East, and on and on and on. Some liberal-minded people, particularly those of an atheist bent, will rattle off these examples as clear proof that religion is a force for evil in the world.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But what if it’s more complicated than that? What if there’s less evidence than one might think that religion causes violence? That’s the provocative thesis of an upcoming new article in </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Contemporary Voices: St Andrews Journal of International Relations</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><a href="https://cvir.st-andrews.ac.uk/about/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">a journal launched in April of 2018</span></a><i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">available </span><a href="https://psyarxiv.com/gzspe/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">as a preprint</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">), authored by Joshua Wright and Yuelee Khoo at Simon Fraser University. </span></p>
<p><span id="more-37106"></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The paper is mostly dedicated to a literature review which summarises a wide array of findings about the supposed link between religion and violence. Overall, Wright and Khoo argue that the literature points in both directions, and that there’s little reason, at this relatively early juncture in understanding the connection between religion and behaviour, to believe that there’s something unique to religious ideologies that cause them to foster violence.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That said, there are certainly plenty of studies on the side of the ledger that suggest religion does cause violence. For example, the authors cite research showing that the more that people felt the September 11th attacks to be a violation of their sacred values, the more likely they were to “endorse … the use of nuclear and biological weapons in response.” Similarly, “The more Christians perceive Jews as desecrators of Christianity, the more prejudice they exhibit toward [them].”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">the authors also highlight complexities that fog up the picture. For example, they cite one </span><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1468-5906.2005.00264.x"><span style="font-weight: 400;">study</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> by US psychologist Tammy Greer that found (in Wright’s and Khoo’s words) “greater frequency of church attendance and greater frequency of engagement in church activities was associated with less self-reported vengeance,” but at the same time that “a more consistent donation pattern was related to greater self-reported vengeance.” This suggests that, in some circumstances at least, asking slightly different questions about religiosity can yield answers pointing opposite directions.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Other studies, meanwhile, provide apparently unequivocal evidence </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">against</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the “religion causes violence” argument, including </span><a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0047235200000647"><span style="font-weight: 400;">one</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of “600 men in the Arkansas correctional system” for whom religiosity was correlated with “lower self-reported acts of actual violent behavior over one’s lifetime,” which lined up with the results of </span><a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/1386973"><span style="font-weight: 400;">another study</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> showing an inverse link between church attendance and crime in Sweden. And “Longitudinal work confirms the relationship between greater involvement in religious activities and less aggressive behavior across the lifespan,” say Wright and Khoo. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So the literature is clearly a hodgepodge. And even if religion can be linked to an increased susceptibility to violence, the authors point out that this is not unique to religion. “While threat perceptions toward individuals’ religious identities may institute aggressive or violent responses, these effects are a product of a general social psychological process of group behavior, rather than anything inherent to religion,” they write. That is, when ardent adherents of secular ideologies sense threat, they, too, often lash out at outsiders – what’s going on is a fairly universal aspect of social psychology. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There could have been many situations in which researchers, by only asking questions about religion, missed this bigger picture. For example, while attendance at religious services has been associated with increased hostility toward, and intentions to harm, outgroups, it could be that religious attendance is simply a proxy for people having strong in-group identification. It’s plausible that greater attendance at national, sporting or other secular ceremonies, might similarly correlate with hostility towards relevant outgroups – but if the only questions you ask are about religion, the only answers you get will be about religion.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In their conclusion, Wright and Khoo make a final point that should give pause to anyone who thinks the research literature, at present, offers a comprehensive look at the link between religion and violence. As they explain, “What makes religion unique … is a belief in the supernatural, the meaning of this belief to the individual and the group, and the internalization and integration of religious identity to the individual.” And yet “Direct study of supernaturalism is noticeably absent in the literature.” If the authors are correct, this means researchers have so far left out the single most important aspect of religious identity – leaving an incomplete picture as to whether it really does have a unique effect on the likelihood of violence or not.</span></p>

<p>Attachment theory, which was first proposed in the 1950s by the British psychoanalyst John Bowlby, is one of the most influential in psychology. It argues for the importance of our earliest relationships with our caregivers, and predicts that these formative bonds will shape the nature of our connections with other people for the rest of our lives. Remarkably, however, psychologists still know relatively little about how people’s attachment style – essentially their characteristic style of relating to other people – typically varies through life. “How do attachment orientations change across the life span? Unfortunately … this critical question has eluded researchers,” write William Chopik and colleagues in their recently published <a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2017-33544-001">paper</a> in <em>Journal of Personality and Social Psychology</em>.</p>
<p>Their research is the first to document how attachment style varies, on average, through decades of the lifespan, from age 13 to 72. The results suggest that, <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2018/01/09/new-insights-into-lifetime-personality-change-from-meta-study-featuring-50000-participants/">like other aspects of personality</a>, attachment style is relatively stable through life, but that it is not entirely fixed, and in particular that it may be shaped by our relationship experiences, as well as the varied social demands of different life stages. “The current study is one of the first truly longitudinal investigations into life span changes in attachment orientation and the antecedents of these changes,” write Chopik and his team.</p>
<p><span id="more-37096"></span></p>
<p>The data come from five historic projects, involving personality surveys of 628 US citizens born between 1920 and 1967. The shortest of these was 9 years and the longest was 47 years. They all involved participants being assessed repeatedly over many years using the California Adult Q-sort – a measure that includes 100 personality items. Chopik and his team focused on 14 key items from this measure, allowing them to compile scores for “anxious attachment” and “avoidant attachment” for each participant. People who score highly on “anxious attachment” fear rejection and constantly seek reassurance. People who score highly on “avoidant attachment” find intimacy uncomfortable and find it difficult to provide emotional support to others. Low scores on both anxiety and avoidance is a sign of having a secure attachment style.</p>
<p>The researchers stitched the data from the five historic samples together, so that they had scores for anxious and avoidant attachment spanning 59 years. Past research has already looked at how people of different ages vary in their attachment scores, but one problem with that kind of cross-sectional research is that any differences between people of different ages could be due to generational differences, rather than due to developmental trends. The new research largely overcome that problem, with Chopik and his team able to identify clear age-related trends in the same individuals over time.</p>
<p>Specifically, the team found that people’s anxious attachment tended to be high in adolescence, increasing into their young adulthood, before then declining through life into their middle and old age. Avoidant attachment showed less change with age, but started higher in adolescence and then declined in linear fashion through life.</p>
<p>The researchers surmised that attachment anxiety and avoidance may be high in adolescence due to the stressful transition from having primarily close bonds with parents to having meaningful relationships with peers and first romantic relationships. They also pointed out that mid-life – when anxiety and avoidance tend to decline – is arguably the time when we are most invested in various social roles and relationships and that “…increases in security often result from people becoming more comfortable in their relationships, gaining more evidence that the relationship will last, and having spouses who serve attachment needs and functions that promote close relations.” Meanwhile, in later life, when attachment anxiety and avoidance are typically lowest, they said people tend to be very focused on the here and now – “declines in anxiety and avoidance may reflect the efforts of older adults to become closer to their close friends and family,” they said.</p>
<p>Another finding from the study was that at all times of life, being in a close romantic relationship tended to go hand in hand with scoring lower on attachment anxiety and avoidance. “Romantic partners reward appropriate behaviour and admonish inappropriate behaviour … ,” the researchers said. “By investing in these social roles, individuals adhere to the rules and appropriate behaviour of close relationships and may change how they approach relationships accordingly, perhaps becoming more secure.”</p>
<p>It’s worth noting that this research looked at group averages, which inevitably masks the idiosyncratic ways that some people may change in their attachment style through life. The study is also limited by only involving participants from the US, the fact that it relied on extracting attachment scores from a measure not designed for that purpose, and that data was stitched together from multiple samples so as to cover the period from adolescence to later life. In a way, however, that last point is also a positive: “given the many ways in which these samples differed, the amount of consistency across the samples in estimating changes over time in attachment is even more remarkable. The converging evidence is a testament to the robustness of these results, such that they were found under different conditions in samples collected between 1936 and 2016,” the researchers explained.</p>
<p>There is plenty for future research to build on, including looking at how the consequences of different attachment styles might vary at different stages of life, and whether and how early life experiences might interact with the developmental trends identified in this study.  The researchers concluded that “By examining these future directions and identifying the conditions under which attachment orientations change, we can finally start taking seriously Bowlby’s claim that attachment experiences are important from the cradle to the grave.”</p>

<p><i>By</i> <a href="https://emmayoung.net/">Emma Young</a></p>
<p>When we think of ways to calm ourselves via our senses, the obvious is to listen to relaxing music, have a massage, or perhaps to gaze upon a rustic scene. However, evidence is growing for a far less obvious option involving the vestibular system (located in the inner ear), which detects the position and movement of the head. According to a <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2019/02/01/rock-a-bye-adult-study-shows-grown-ups-enjoy-better-sleep-and-memory-consolidation-in-a-rocking-bed/">recent study</a>, gentle rocking helps adults to fall asleep for a nap, and to sleep more soundly during an entire night, with the researchers who conducted that research hypothesising that the effect is driven by the vestibular system. Now new exploratory work by a different team provides further hints that stimulating the vestibular system can help to calm the brain — in this case, apparently reducing anxiety.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>For the <a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnsys.2019.00014/full?utm_source=F-AAE&amp;utm_medium=EMLF&amp;utm_campaign=MRK_973135_55_Neuros_20190425_arts_A">new study</a> in <i>Frontiers in Systems Neuroscience</i>, led by Florane Pasquier at the University of Caen Normandy, the 22 healthy young adult participants weren’t physically rocked. Rather, electrodes, placed behind their ears, delivered a very mild, 1mA current to stimulate the nerves that carry signals from the individual components of the vestibular system to the brain. This technique is called galvanic vestibular stimulation (GVS).<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><span id="more-37077"></span></p>
<p>The student participants took part in three sessions, each one held at the same time on the same day each week for three weeks. One was a 38-minute sham session during which no current was used; another involved 38 minutes of GVS, while the last involved 76-minutes of the stimulation (participants completed the different sessions in a randomised order). Before and after each session, the participants indicated on a visual scale how relaxed or tense they felt (as a simple measure of their anxiety levels), and also reported any feelings of motion sickness (a conflict between signals from the vestibular system versus the eyes and other sensory receptors in the body is thought to cause motion sickness.)<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Only one session was associated with a significant decrease in the anxiety measure the researchers reported: the shorter, 38-minute period of stimulation. This was associated with a drop of about one quarter in the anxiety measure, post- vs pre-test, whereas there was no drop after the sham treatment, and only a hint of a much smaller drop after the double-duration stimulation. Pasquier’s team suspect that the electrical stimulation of neurons from the vestibular system may simulate the effects of gentle rocking, as in a train or car<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>— something that can make many of us, whether adults or children, feel drowsy. “A possible hypothesis is the sedative effect of GVS on arousal state,” the researchers write.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>The results are consistent with other studies that have also found vestibular stimulation can affect mood. For example, one that found <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4800522/">swinging on a swing improved the anxiety</a> levels of university students.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Why didn’t the longer session of GVS work? It’s not clear. Perhaps a clue comes from the fact that after a 76-minute session — but not the shorter 38-minute session— some participants reported feeling motion sickness.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Clearly, this is preliminary research. The anxiety measure was simple, and the study was conducted on a small number of young adults who didn’t report having any anxiety problems. Might a shorter session reduce anxiety scores, too? Is the apparent anxiety effect sustained, and if so, for how long? Could GVS make any real-world difference to people suffering from an anxiety disorder, or who are about to go into an anxiety-provoking situation, and is it 100 per cent safe? Only future research will tell. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
