              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/ants-metal-infused-sharp-jaws-biology">How metal-infused jaws give some ants an exceptionally sharp bite</a></h4>

              
                <p>If you’ve ever felt the wrath of a biting or stinging insect, it may seem incredible that something so small can so easily slice or puncture human skin.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Scientists already knew that some small animals’ piercing and slashing body parts are infused with metals such as zinc and manganese, making the parts tough and durable. Now, a study published September 1 in <em>Scientific Reports</em> shows <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-021-91795-y">how these toollike appendages form hard and extremely sharp cutting edges</a>.</p>



<p>Robert Schofield, a physicist at the University of Oregon in Eugene, and colleagues used a special microscope to examine the sharp “teeth” that line the jaws of <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/leaf-cutting-ant-body-armor-mineral-exoskeleton-fight">leaf-cutting ants</a> called <em>Atta cephalotes</em>, revealing the teeth’s atomic structure (<em>SN: 11/24/20</em>). The team found that zinc atoms were dispersed homogeneously, rather than in chunks, throughout a single tooth. This uniformity allows the ants to grow much thinner, sharper blades, since “chunks of mineral limit how sharp the tool can be,” Schofield says.</p>



<p>The team also tested a suite of properties of these metal-infused materials, known as heavy element biomaterials, in ant teeth, spider fangs, scorpion stingers and marine worm jaws, among others. These structures are stiffer and more damage resistant than biomineralized materials, like the calcium phosphate typically found in teeth or the combination of calcium carbonate and the protein chitin in many arthropod shells, the team found. The metal-fortified body parts have “the kinds of properties that you want in a knife or needle,” Schofield says.</p>



<p>The team estimates that the zinc-infused teeth of <em>A. cephalotes</em> allow it to puncture and cut using only about 60 percent of the energy and muscle mass it would otherwise.&nbsp;</p>



<p>By making these sharp, precisely sculpted tools, ants and other small animals can make up for their tiny muscles, allowing them to acquire and process foods that would normally be beyond their reach.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/cold-plasma-agriculture-sustainable-farms-fertilizer">Cold plasma could transform the sustainable farms of the future</a></h4>

              
                <p>Physicist Stephan Reuter of Polytechnique Montréal spends most days using his expertise in energy and matter to improve medical technologies. Recently though, he stood in a sea of green to consider how a shower of charged particles might affect lettuce.</p>



<p>He had been invited to one of the largest commercial greenhouses in Quebec to help the growers rethink the energy of agriculture. Inside the building, encased by glass walls and covering more ground than four soccer fields, thousands upon thousands of lettuce plants floated on polystyrene mats in a hydroponic, or no-soil, growing system. The crop was nearly ready to be picked, packaged and shipped. Reuter’s task was to use physics to help the company, Hydroserre Inc. in Mirabel, reduce its carbon footprint.</p>



<p>To that end, the company is interested in finding new ways to fight pathogens and to deliver fertilizer to the growing plants. Many fertilizers contain ammonia, which is produced from nitrogen (necessary for plant growth) and hydrogen using a chemical reaction called the Haber-Bosch process. This process revolutionized agriculture in the early 20th century by making mass production of fertilizer possible. However, the process yields hundreds of millions of metric tons of carbon dioxide each year.</p>



<p>“Ideally, we want a fertilizer that’s renewable,” Reuter says. And to make it truly green, it should be created at the farm, making transport, another carbon emitter, unnecessary. Reuter and a growing number of chemists, physicists and engineers think they can see how to make that happen. These researchers are working toward future farms that are truly sustainable, where the energy from renewable sources like wind or solar is harnessed to make an efficient fertilizer on-site. They hope to realize this vision by exploiting plasma.</p>





<h4>Plasma everywhere</h4>



<p>Reuter might seem an unlikely consultant for an agricultural challenge. After all, his expertise is in the physics of plasma, one of the four fundamental states of matter, along with solids, liquids and gases.</p>



<p>Plasma is remarkably common. In fact, most matter seen in the known universe — more than 99.9 percent, according to astrophysicists — is in a plasma state. Lightning produces plasma. So do those inexpensive novelty lamps in museum gift shops. Switch on the power, and an electrode at the sphere’s center produces a high voltage that interacts with the gas sealed inside the glass to form tendrils of colored plasma that radiate outward. Touch the glass, and the plasma tendrils seem to reach toward your fingers.</p>



<p>The sun is a ball of plasma and gas. The <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/nasa-parker-solar-probe-reveals-sun-plasma-waves-magnetic-islands">solar wind is a stream of plasma</a> that peels off the sun (<em>SN: 12/21/19 </em>&amp; <em>1/4/20, p. 6</em>). When that wind collides with the protective, plasma-rich magnetic cushion that envelopes Earth, the interactions produce rivers of light seen in the aurora borealis and aurora australis.</p>



<p>Plasma is also a workhorse of modern technology. Engineers use it to etch the millions of tiny transistors found on the chips in today’s computers, cars and musical birthday cards. The pixels in plasma televisions contain gas that forms a plasma, sealed inside tiny cells sandwiched between two glass plates, and neon signs and fluorescent lights glow because of plasma. Some former astronauts even predict that plasma engines will someday propel us to Mars.</p>



<p>But what exactly is plasma? It’s a soup of electrons with their negative charges, positive ions and neutral atoms that also produces electromagnetic fields and ultraviolet and infrared radiation. Plasma comes about when gas gets super energized — by heat or an electric current, for example — and electrons are freed from atoms.</p>



<p>Plasmas occur naturally or can be human-made. When produced by high temperatures, such as in the sun, it’s called “hot plasma,” while the plasma created in a plasma ball and other room-temperature, low-pressure environments is called “cold plasma.” Plasma balls make it easy to see: They’re filled with a gaseous mixture that includes one of the very stable, noble gases, like argon, xenon, neon or krypton. Plasma makes up those glowing tendrils that reach out from the center. The high-frequency current excites electrons that then separate from the atoms of gas. Many agricultural experiments include a mix of noble gases and air to yield ions of nitrogen and oxygen.</p>

<p>Scientists have long been interested in plasma’s biological implications. In the late 19th century, the Finnish physicist Karl Selim Lemström observed that the width of growth rings in fir trees near the Arctic Circle followed the cycle of the aurora borealis, widening when the northern lights were strongest. He hypothesized that the light show somehow encouraged plant growth. To artificially emulate the northern lights, he placed a metal wire net over growing plants and ran a current through it. Under the right conditions, he reported, the treatment produced larger vegetable yields.</p>



<p>For decades, scientists have known that exposure to plasma can safely kill pathogenic bacteria, fungi and viruses. Small studies in animals also suggest that plasma can prompt the growth of blood vessels in skin. In his research, Reuter studies ways to harness these properties to inhibit new infections in wounds and expedite healing or treat other skin conditions. But more recently, he and other physicists have been working on ways to use the power of plasma to improve food production.</p>



<p>Experiments conducted in the last decade or so have tested a mix of ways to apply plasma to seeds, seedlings, crops and fields. These include plasma generated using noble gases, as well as plasma generated from air. In some cases, plasma is directly applied through plasma “jets” that stream over the seeds or plants. Another approach uses plasma-treated water that can do double duty: irrigation and fertilization. Some studies have reported a range of benefits, from helping plants grow faster and bigger to resisting pests.</p>



<p>“Even in this very, very early stage of research that we’re at with plasma, which has really only come into its own in the last 10 to 15 years, we’re seeing very promising data,” says plant pathologist Brendan Niemira at the Food Safety and Intervention Technologies Research unit at the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Eastern Regional Research Center in Wyndmoor, Pa. He’s a fan of the approach: On Zoom, Niemira’s avatar shows an almond basking in an eerie, purple plasma glow.</p>



<p>The challenge now, he says, is to figure out whether plasma can deliver at the level of hectares of crops. “Can we make it work in a field environment [to] deliver an advantage that can be integrated into grow systems in the future?”</p>



<p>Nested within that challenge are many others, including finding a way to deliver plasma to plants on a large scale, confirming benefits reported in lab studies and showing that plasma is better than current methods. And, finally, figuring out what the charged soup of plasma is actually doing to plants.</p>



<p>Recent advances became possible, Niemira says, largely because in the 1990s and early 2000s, scientists developed efficient and cost-effective ways to generate cold plasmas by streaming high-energy electrons into a gas. Those electrons would collide with gas molecules, knocking off electrons and producing charged particles. Since then, he says, there’s been something of a rush to test plasma on plants at all stages of growth and with a range of strategies.</p>

<h3>Two paths </h3>



<p>Researchers are investigating a range of potential agricultural benefits from plasma. Some studies suggest plasma boosts plant growth and yield. Others show that plasma also might have a role in preserving food by eliminating pathogenic bacteria and fungi from plant surfaces. </p>

<h4>Surface changes</h4>



<p>One of the most appealing uses of plasma, according to Reuter, is as a fertilizer alternative to ammonia. His plan for the Mirabel greenhouse project, which he helped launch in spring 2021 with scientists from the Quebec-based nonprofit IRDA, or Research and Development Institute for the Agri-Environment, goes something like this: The plasma is generated by sending an electric current through a gas that, ideally, is just air. That process creates a mix of charged and neutral particles, including electrons and ions, that can produce reactive species of nitrogen and oxygen. In tabletop experiments and then in the greenhouse, Reuter and his colleagues will enrich water with plasma, then study whether it can reduce pathogens and affect the growing plants.</p>



<p>Reactive species, as the name implies, are ready to react with atoms and molecules, including in living things, and are biologically available to plants. When the plasma is added to the water, those reactive species dissolve. The resulting plasma-infused water, with its biologically available nitrogen, will then be used to irrigate the plants. It will do the same job as ammonia: Nitrogen, which plants require for growth, is delivered as ions, excited molecules and compounds in the water. While heavy doses of reactive species can harm plant cells or DNA, the amount in plasma-treated water has been shown to be safe for the plant, Reuter says.</p>

<p>Experiments led by biochemist Alexander Volkov of Oakwood University in Huntsville, Ala., offer another example of the kind of research going on in plasma agriculture. Volkov studies the ways in which plants and electromagnetism interact. For example, he’s shown how <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2634039/">an electric stimulus can trigge</a>r the closing mechanism on a Venus flytrap.</p>



<p>Recently, Volkov set out to study how plasma would affect 20 seeds of dragon’s-tongue, a cultivar of the bush bean <em>Phaseolus vulgaris</em>. The experiment was low-tech. He and colleagues balanced the seeds on a plasma ball for one minute each, then incubated the seeds in water for seven hours. Two days later, the scientists found that in plasma-treated seeds, the radicle — the little protrusion of root that makes a seed a seedling — measured 2.7 centimeters, compared with 1.8 centimeters in untreated seeds, <a href="https://www.publish.csiro.au/FP/FP20293">a gain of 50 percent</a>. The team reported the results in <em>Functional Plant Biology</em> in February 2021.</p>



<div class="wp-block-sciencenews-content-sidebar">
<h3>Roots emerge&nbsp;</h3>



<p>Biochemist Alexander Volkov and colleagues exposed bush bean seeds to plasma jets, then immersed the seeds in water for a day. Two days later, plasma-treated seeds showed larger radicles, or starter roots. The least growth occurred in untreated seeds. The others received plasma for 30 seconds, one minute, five minutes and 15 minutes (shown below). Using a plasma globe, he got less striking results.</p>

<p>Less than a centimeter of extra growth may seem modest, but Volkov was encouraged. The benefit couldn’t have come from the reactive species of nitrogen and oxygen because they can’t exit the glass sphere, but somehow, the treated seeds seemed to take up more water to grow faster.</p>



<p>To investigate that idea, he and colleagues studied the seeds using an atomic force microscope and magnetic resonance imaging, which reveals how tissues take up water. At the micrometer-level view of the atomic force microscope, Volkov saw that exposure had roughed up the surface of the seeds. The images looked like carved mountain ranges. Those ridges gave the water more surface area to glom on to, and more openings through which to soak the inside of the seeds, he hypothesized. MRI images of treated beans showed larger swaths of white — indicating more water inside — than untreated beans.</p>



<p>“When we use the plasma balls or lamps, the water can penetrate easily through the pores and accelerate germination,” he says.</p>

<h4>Growing evidence</h4>



<p>Physicist Nevena Puač of the Institute of Physics Belgrade in Serbia has performed dozens of studies testing plasma on plants and has been working in the field for decades. She says most studies — successful or not — have tested two ideas: plasma as a disinfectant or as a growth instigator.</p>



<p>On the disinfecting front, plasma jet treatments of less than a minute on foods including apples, cherry tomatoes and lettuce can reduce disease-causing bacteria, such as <em>Escherichia coli</em>, <em>Salmonella </em>and <em>Listeria</em>. Some studies have looked at higher exposure times as well: In a 2008 study, five minutes of plasma treatment inactivated 90 percent of pathogenic <em>Aspergillus parasiticus</em> fungi on hazelnuts, peanuts and pistachios.</p>



<p>This is the research branch that Niemira works on as well. In May 2019 in <em>LWT–Food Science and Technology</em>, he and colleagues showed that <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.lwt.2018.12.049">plasma treatment combined with an existing sanitizer killed 99.9 percent of <em>Listeria</em> on apples in under four minutes</a>. Working alone, the sanitizer achieved comparable results after an hour. The combination works much better than either one could possibly work alone, he says.</p>



<p>Investigations on seed germination and plant growth are similarly promising. Researchers at the Chinese Academy of Sciences in Nanjing exposed soybean seeds to plasma. Seven days after exposure, the roots were up to 27 percent heavier than roots from untreated seeds, the team reported in 2014. The same year, researchers in Romania reported similar gains for radish roots and sprouts.</p>



<p>At last year’s Gaseous Electronics Conference, hosted online by the American Physical Society, researchers from Japan presented results from a study of young seedlings treated directly with plasma and with plasma-treated water in a rice paddy in the Aichi prefecture. Plants treated directly with plasma early in the growth process had up to a 15 percent higher yield than untreated plants. But treating plants late in the growth process lowered the yield. Timing matters, Puač says. So does the application method: In some cases in the experiments in Japan, plasma-treated water actually lowered the yield.</p>



<p>“To my knowledge this was the first study where plants were treated directly,” rather than as seeds or after harvest for disinfection, says engineer Katharina Stapelmann of North Carolina State University in Raleigh, who organized the session.</p>



<p>Studies have connected plasma treatment to a range of benefits, Puač says, from growth rate to yield. But other studies suggest that plasma won’t ever be a one-size-fits-all technology.</p>



<p>Researchers in South Korea reported in the <em>Journal of Physics D: Applied Physics</em> in 2020, for example, that while a six-minute plasma exposure boosted germination rates of barley sprouts, an 18-minute exposure, over three days, produced no benefit in growth and lowered total plant weight. Experimental results published in 2000 looked at the effects of direct plasma jets on peas, corn and radishes and found detrimental effects that varied by the gas used in the plasma. The seeds were exposed for two to 20 minutes, and seeds with prolonged exposure were slower to germinate than untreated seeds.</p>

<p>What the research shows, Reuter says, is that before plasma becomes a staple on farms around the world, scientists need to better understand the myriad ways that the fourth state of matter could affect plants.</p>



<p>For instance, successful outcomes for plants might be due in part to the UV radiation produced by plasma; UV radiation has long been used as a disinfectant. The reactive nitrogen and oxygen species, which can be helpful or harmful to living cells depending on how they’re used, probably help as nutrients and disinfectants, as well. Plasma also produces electric and magnetic fields and infrared and visible light. Their impact on plants also hasn’t been fully explored. Even though researchers know what’s in the plasma, and can see how the plants respond, they don’t have the details mapped out, Volkov says.</p>



<h4>Gardens big and small</h4>



<p>Projects are under way around the world to test plasma on large scales and in different settings. Dutch scientists working in Uganda have developed portable “reactors” that use plasma to generate fertilizers from the air. They hope this invention can meet the need for fertilizers in places where farmers often can’t get ammonia. Early in 2022, Reuter hopes to report his first results from desktop experiments. The hydroponic growing system at Hydroserre will provide him with the opportunity to refine his method.</p>



<p>With any luck, he says, the project will show a way for future farms to replace ammonia and reduce carbon emissions.</p>



<p>While researchers and growers await those results, citizen scientists, amateur physicists and experimental gardeners have been known to make space in the shed for a plasma ball next to their rakes and shovels, to run their own experiments at home.</p>



<p>Volkov has jumped in. When the pandemic shut down his lab last year, he took his work — and his plasma balls — home. He bathed the vegetable seeds for his garden for a minute in the lamp’s rich, purplish glow, and then planted them.</p>



<p>“It was cucumber, tomatoes, eggplants, cabbage,” he says. A backyard test run isn’t proof of anything, Volkov readily acknowledges, and any gardener can attest that a finicky combination of variables can make or break a garden.</p>



<p>But he did see an astounding harvest last fall. By late October, he was still picking big, ripe tomatoes from the vines grown from plasma-treated seeds, at a time when the plants from untreated seeds have often withered. The cucumbers were bigger and juicier. The cabbages, planted in a friend’s nursery, were heavier and more delicious, he says. “I got a fantastic amount of everything.”</p>

                <p><em>By </em><a href="http://emilyoliviareynolds.com/">Emily Reynolds</a></p>



<p>The media plays a huge part in shaping our understanding of the world, including how we respond to other people. Coverage of immigration is no different, and previous <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/1369183X.2017.1412253">research</a> has suggested that even subtle changes in language and framing can change the way people think about immigrants.</p>



<p>A <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-021-95800-2">new study</a>, published in <em>Scientific Reports</em>, looks at the real life impact of negative media portrayals of immigrants. It finds that negative coverage can increase hostility towards immigrants and favouritism towards members of the non-immigrant in-group — which can have serious financial, emotional and social consequences for communities.</p>



<span id="more-43583"></span>



<p>The first study involved 350 Italian students, some of whom first watched a TV report about immigration. In one condition, participants saw a negative report, which argued that immigration was costly and a threat to the cultural identity of non-immigrants; in another immigrants were portrayed as a positive resource and opportunity to enrich the local culture. Those in the third group watched no video at all. Before and after watching the video, participants gave a sample of their saliva.</p>



<p>Next, participants completed measures relating to their perception of the threat immigration poses, how anxious they felt engaging with immigrants, and how they felt about the video. The game element of the study then began, with participants taking part in a &#8220;trust game&#8221; designed to measure trust, and a &#8220;dictator game&#8221; designed to measure altruism.</p>



<p>In the trust game, the participants were given ten euros and asked how much they wanted to send to another person. This amount would then be tripled, and the “trustee” would then send a portion of the money back (so, in theory, the participant could make a higher amount of money if they trusted the receiver to send a substantial portion back). Participants played both as the sender and the receiver at different points of the study. In the dictator game, participants were again asked to send a portion of ten euros to a receiver or to receive money themselves, only this time no money was sent back.</p>



<p>Importantly, some participants saw a list of their partners in the game that consisted of distinctly Italian names; some saw a mixture of Italian names and names that suggested their partners were immigrants; and some saw no names.</p>



<p>The results showed that participants who watched the negative video were more altruistic towards those with traditionally Italian names than to those with names that sounded as if they belonged to immigrants. There was also some evidence that they were less likely to trust those they believed were immigrants (by sending them less money in the trust game). The negative video was also associated with increased perceptions of immigration as a threat, and with increased testosterone-cortisol ratio, which can indicate higher levels of stress and aggression.</p>



<p>A second study replicated these methods, only this time participants shared demographic data and completed measures of political orientation, how likely they are to give gifts, and subtle and blatant prejudice towards immigration and immigrants. They then watched the videos and completed the games as in the first study. Finally, participants answered questions on outgroup threat, how much they believed immigrants represent a health risk for the Italian population, and anxiety around engaging with immigrants.</p>



<p>In this case, those who watched the negative video were less likely to behave in a trusting way towards those with non-Italian sounding names compared to those with traditional Italian names. Unsurprisingly, left- and right-wing participants exhibited different levels of trust towards immigrants: right-wing respondents who saw the negative video were less likely to trust immigrants, while there was no effect of the video for left-wing respondents. Similarly, those who displayed blatant and subtle prejudices were less likely to feel trust towards immigrants after watching the negative video, but there was no effect of the video for those with low levels of prejudice.</p>



<p>So, the results suggest, anti-immigrant media coverage can have a serious impact. Responses were threefold: emotional, through increased anxiety; physiological, through markers of stressed or aggressive responses; and material, through the reduced likelihood of sharing money. Prosocial behaviour towards non-immigrants, however, <em>increased</em>, suggesting again that immigrants could lose out in a society primed to reject and exclude them.</p>



<p>The fact that the positive video had no significant effect was also a key insight; the team suggests this may have been because of a bias towards remembering or being impacted by negative messaging. Thinking carefully about how to counter this negative bias could therefore be a key way of reducing the anti-immigrant sentiments all too prevalent in the media today.</p>



<p>&#8211; <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-021-95800-2">Negative media portrayals of immigrants increase ingroup favoritism and hostile physiological and emotional reactions</a></p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/chocolate-tempering-saturated-fat-phospholipid-chemistry">A pinch of saturated fat could make tempering chocolate a breeze</a></h4>

              
                <p>Glossy, velvety chocolate that snaps in the fingers and melts in the mouth is the chocolatier’s dream.</p>



<p>But crafting cocoa confections with this optimal texture is no easy feat. The endeavor, known as tempering, demands carefully warming and cooling liquid chocolate until it crystallizes into its most delectable form. Now, scientists may have found a shortcut: adding <a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-021-25206-1">a small pinch of fatty molecules</a> called phospholipids, researchers report August 31 in <em>Nature Communications</em>.</p>



<p>With phospholipids, “you can simplify the whole tempering process, making sure you always have the right quality of the chocolate,” says food chemist Alejandro Marangoni of the University of Guelph in Canada.</p>



<p>Curious about what occurs on a molecular level during tempering, Marangoni and colleagues focused on the ingredient that gives chocolate its texture — cocoa butter. While previous tempering research had targeted cocoa butter’s main component, triglycerides, the team set its sights on a different sweet spot: the minor components, which include free fatty acids and phospholipids. Removing these minor components from the cocoa butter and adding them back in one by one allowed the researchers to figure out each component’s role during tempering.</p>





<p>With just a pinch of phospholipids added to the cocoa butter — achieving a weight concentration of 0.1 percent of the chocolate’s total — the mixture rapidly crystallized into the elusive, melt-in-the-mouth texture. The process required a single cooling to 20˚ Celsius rather than multiple heating and cooling cycles as tempering typically demands.</p>



<p>Next, the team increased the phospholipid weight concentration in melted dark chocolate by an extra 0.1 percent, and easily produced high-quality textures again. The result suggests that phospholipids could be used to simplify chocolate tempering.</p>



<p>The hack could help small-scale chocolatiers avoid the complications and expenses associated with tempering machines, Marangoni says. Large-scale manufacturers, on the other hand, would need to figure out how to evenly disperse phospholipids in a large vat of molten chocolate, he says.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2021/09/07/hand-gestures-help-students-mentally-organise-new-information/">Hand Gestures Help Students Mentally Organise New Information</a></h4>

              
                <p><em>By </em><a href="https://twitter.com/E_Barratt">Emma L. Barratt</a></p>



<p>Retaining new information can be tricky, especially with topics far outside of what we’re familiar with. A good teacher can make a huge difference, but effective teaching techniques can add new dimensions to our ability to really take on what we’re being told.</p>



<p>A <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/acp.3866?af=R">new study</a> by academics from the University of California and University of Georgia identifies one such technique, and it turns out to be incredibly simple: hand gestures.</p>



<span id="more-43574"></span>



<p>The team wanted to know if gestures used by teachers could assist in mental organisation of new information, and help students retain and understand lesson content. To do this, they devised two experiments, looking specifically at two types of hand motion: structure gestures, which indicated which of two groups was being discussed by gestures made to the left or right, and surface gestures, which illustrated physical characteristics.</p>



<p>In the first experiment, student participants (N=123) were shown one of four videos depicting an instructor using one, both, or neither of these types of gestures to embellish their lesson on steamboats. Structure gestures — moving their hands to the left or right — were used to indicate whether they were discussing eastern or western steamboats, respectively. Surface gestures, on the other hand, were used to indicate physical features about the depth of the hull, with the instructor moving their hands apart or together to illustrate comparative depths.</p>



<p>Once the video lesson was complete, the students were given a series of computer-based tasks which probed their retention of the lesson material. During recall and matching tasks, students were asked to write a summary of the lesson they had received and match a set of facts to their respective steamboat vehicles.</p>



<p>Students also completed an inference test, where they were asked to make connections between different steamboat characteristics, answering questions like “If a steamboat operates on a shallow river, what does that tell you about the pressure of the steamboat’s engine?” This test in particular was chosen as a good measure of whether students had constructed a well-organised mental representation of their new steamboat knowledge, because it requires an amount of mental manipulation, as opposed to just an ability to recall lesson content.</p>



<p>The team found that students who had seen the lesson with structure gestures scored significantly higher in inference tests. This suggests that physical gestures allocating spoken information into physical spaces helps students to better construct an organised mental framework of lesson material, from which they could make accurate inferences.</p>



<p>However, gestures aren’t a silver bullet for everything. Neither structure nor surface gestures improved basic recall of the material. Similarly, participants who saw surface gestures showed no difference in their inference scores compared to those who didn’t.</p>



<p>The researchers built on these findings in a second experiment which took much the same form. This time, however, the videos were much more complex. Focusing on innate and adaptive immunity, the lessons contained nearly twice as many words and included many more comparisons than the steamboat lesson.</p>



<p>Even though these lessons were significantly more complex to follow, the results were similarly promising. Once again, structure gestures that divided innate and adaptive immunity using left and right gestures, respectively, significantly boosted student (N=170) scores in the inference test portion. And, as with experiment number one, surface gestures — which consisted of placing hands further apart or closer to indicate how specific an immune response is — did not assist with inference scores. Neither gesture improved overall recall of the material.</p>



<p>The researchers believe that these findings are in line with the previously proposed construction-integration model of learning, and that left/right structure gestures provided a scaffold upon which students could better build links between lesson content. In future research, there’s scope to explore how this technique can be applied to other types of gestures beyond those used for simple comparisons, as well as verifying that this effect can be generalised to the classroom, where attention may be more easily distracted.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/earthquake-pictogram-oldest-known-account-americas">This pictogram is one of the oldest known accounts of earthquakes in the Americas</a></h4>

              
                <p>A 50-page codex of colorful, complex pictograms that dates to the early 16th century includes the most complete — and one of the oldest — written chronologies of early earthquakes in the Americas.</p>



<p>The <em>Telleriano-Remensis</em>, which was created by an unknown pre-Hispanic civilization, describes 12 separate <a href="https://doi.org/10.1785/0220210161">earthquakes that rocked what’s now Mexico and Central America from 1460 to 1542</a>, researchers report August 25 in <em>Seismological Research Letters</em>. The famous codex was written by specialists called <em>tlacuilos</em>, meaning “those who write painting” in the Nahuatl language spoken by <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/ancient-ball-court-aztecs-maya-society">Aztecs and other pre-Hispanic civilizations</a> in the area (<em>SN: 3/13/20</em>).</p>



<p>Using other codices from the region, researchers had previously identified the combination of two pictographs that denotes an earthquake. One shows four helices around a central circle or eye, and stands for <em>ollin</em>, meaning “movement” in Nahuatl. The other pictograph shows one or more rectangular layers filled with dots, and means <em>tlalli</em>, or “earth.” For daytime earthquakes, the eye is open; for nighttime quakes, it’s closed.</p>

Suárez and V. García-Acosta/<em>Seismological Research Letters</em> 2021</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>Seismologist Gerardo Suárez of the National Autonomous University of Mexico and social anthropologist Virginia García-Acosta of the Center for Research and Higher Studies in Social Anthropology, both in Mexico City, pored over the <em>Telleriano-Remensis</em><em>. </em>The researchers were looking for representations of quakes, comparing what they found to accounts of quakes in other pre-Hispanic codices and texts written later by Spanish friars.</p>



<p>The <em>Telleriano-Remensis</em> uses a pictorial representation of a 52-year cycle to roughly date the quakes. Years are represented by four signs— <em>tecpatl</em> (knife), <em>calli</em> (house), <em>tochtli</em> (rabbit) and <em>acatl</em> (reed) — arranged in 13 permutations. Those images helped the researchers match some pictorial accounts of quakes, including one in 1507, to later descriptions of the events.</p>



<p>Little more is recounted about the precise locations of these quakes or the damage they caused, although one image suggests that a quake triggered flooding that drowned warriors. Other codices may contain more clues, the researchers say, which could help create a more complete chronology of the quakes that shook this ancient world.</p>

                <p><em>By </em><a href="http://emilyoliviareynolds.com/">Emily Reynolds</a></p>



<p>Research has found significant racial biases when judging the emotions of others. Black people are more likely to be misjudged as angry, for example, and <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2020/08/04/teacher-trainees-are-more-likely-to-misread-black-children-as-angry-than-white-children/">recent research</a> has suggested that even children are victims of this &#8220;anger bias&#8221;. Black children are also frequently subject to <a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/doiLanding?doi=10.1037%2Fa0035663">&#8220;adultification&#8221;</a> — being perceived as older and more mature than White peers.</p>



<p>A <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/02699931.2021.1950127?journalCode=pcem20">new study</a> explores the links between these two phenomena, finding that the older adults believe Black children to be, the more likely they are to (incorrectly) judge them to be angry too. Writing in <em>Cognition and Emotion</em>, Alison N. Cooke and Amy G. Halberstadt from North Carolina State University argue that such judgements could have serious consequences for Black children.</p>



<span id="more-43464"></span>



<p>Participants, 152 parents from the US, viewed forty expressions on the faces of children, representing happiness, sadness, disgust, surprise, or fear, and had to indicate which emotion they saw (none of children made an angry expression, but participants were able to indicate that the emotion was one of anger). Participants were also shown still images of each of the forty children displaying a neutral expression and asked to indicate the age of the child.</p>



<p>While the race of the children did not make a significant difference to their perceived age, participants were more likely to incorrectly judge Black children to be angry, replicating previous research. And the interaction between the race of the child and their perceived age was also a predictor of anger bias — that is, the older participants believed a Black child to be, the more likely they were to mischaracterise them as angry. For White children, however, there was no such increase in mischaracterisation.</p>



<p>So although participants didn’t perceive the Black children to be any older as a group than the White children, they did perceive them as being angrier, particularly when they believed that a Black child as an <em>individual</em> was older. This may result in more serious consequences for older-seeming Black children than for their White counterparts. A best case scenario, the team argues, would be “confusion that individuals could attempt to clarify or ignore”. Other outcomes, however, could be incredibly serious: targeting by the police, suspension from school, or the perceiver getting angry or violent towards the child.</p>



<p>Future research could explore the perceptions of different demographics: how do police, teachers, or social workers perceive Black and White children, and what impact does it have on the way such children are treated? And how is perceived anger linked to other biases, like the <a href="https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/10.1086/693955">weak bonds</a> teachers feel towards students of colour, for example? “Our findings are important for anyone interacting with children, and particularly those in education and law enforcement,” Cooke <a href="https://news.ncsu.edu/2021/08/anger-bias-adultification/">says</a>. “It really drives home that there is widespread bias in how Black children are viewed and that this can have significant consequences for their well-being.”</p>



<p>Looking at the psychological elements of systemic racism alone, without considering wider societal factors, is unlikely to cause wholesale change. Identifying and acknowledging them, however, is crucial to our understanding of the experiences young Black people have in the UK, US and beyond.</p>



<p>&#8211; <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/02699931.2021.1950127?journalCode=pcem20">Adultification, anger bias, and adults’ different perceptions of Black and White children</a></p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/brain-human-organoids-personalized-cluster-cells-study-disorders">How personalized brain organoids could help us demystify disorders</a></h4>

              
                <p>Clumps of brain cells grown from the stem cells of two people with a neurological syndrome show signs of the disorder. The results, published August 23 in <em>Nature Neuroscience</em>, suggest that <a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41593-021-00906-5">personalized brain organoids</a> could be powerful tools to understand complex disorders.</p>



<p>Researchers are eager to create brain organoids, human stem cells coaxed into becoming 3-D blobs of brain cells, because of their ability to <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/how-build-human-brain">mimic human brains</a> in the lab (<em>SN: 2/20/18</em>). In the current study, researchers grew two kinds of brain organoids. One kind, grown from healthy people’s stem cells, produced complex electrical activity that echoed the brain waves a full-sized brain makes. <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/brain-waves-may-focus-attention-and-keep-information-flowing">These waves</a>, created by the coordinated firing of many nerve cells, are part of how the brain keeps information moving (<em>SN: 3/13/18</em>).</p>



<p>The researchers also grew organoids using cells from a 25-year-old woman and a 5-year-old girl with Rett syndrome, a developmental disorder marked by seizures, autism and developmental lags. Rett syndrome is thought to be caused by changes in a gene called <em>MECP2</em>, mutations that the lab-grown organoids carried as well.</p>



<p>These organoids looked like those grown from healthy people, but behaved differently in some ways. Their nerve cells fired off signals that were too synchronized and less varied. Some of the brain waves these organoids produced are reminiscent of a brain having a seizure, in which a bolus of electrical activity scrambles normal brain business.</p>



<p>With organoids carrying Rett syndrome mutations, scientists can better understand the syndrome and even begin to test possible treatments. Organoids might yield insights into other disorders, too, says coauthor Bennett Novitch, a developmental neuroscientist at the David Geffen School of Medicine at UCLA. “Work on this front is already under way in labs around the world.”</p>

                <p><em>By </em><a href="https://twitter.com/E_Barratt">Emma L. Barratt</a></p>



<p>It’s no secret that marginalised groups face barriers in educational settings that the able-bodied, male, and racially privileged largely do not. Issues pertaining to access, <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2020/08/06/how-stem-fields-can-foster-a-sense-of-belonging-for-minority-and-first-gen-students/">sense of belonging</a>, potential discrimination, and financial difficulties can add often insurmountable layers of complexity to applying for further education.</p>



<p>Efforts to address this in recent years have crystallised into a number of measures, including the wide adoption of diversity and inclusion grants. These provide financial support specifically for selected individuals from marginalised groups, in order to give them a more equal footing with applicants from privileged backgrounds.</p>



<p>However, <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0956797621993109">recent research</a> from Adriana L. Germano and colleagues at The University of Washington has illustrated some unintended flaws with this approach. In stark contrast with the ethos behind diversity and inclusion initiatives, these grants may be serving to make applications to prestigious scholarships even less diverse than before.</p>



<span id="more-43469"></span>



<p>The paper, published in <em>Psychological Science</em>, builds this argument from four separate studies. In the first, participants (N=168) from racial groups underrepresented in US colleges were asked to choose between two hypothetical grants they could apply for: one of $5000, or one of $2500. In one condition, participants read that the smaller amount was available to anyone, and in the other, they learned that it was a diversity award, specifically for underrepresented ethnic or racial minorities. The reasoning behind the participants’ grant selection was then probed by questions that assessed factors such as how likely they felt they would be to get the grant, or how much they felt the scholarship was for people like them.</p>



<p>The team found that when neither grant was labelled as a diversity award, 87% of applicants would shoot for the $5000 award. However, when the smaller grant was labelled as a diversity award, this number dropped sharply, with only 55.3% participants choosing to apply for the larger, unrestricted grant. Analysis of the responses revealed that this was in large part because participants felt that they fit better into the intended group of the diversity award. Not only that, but the large majority were more confident they’d receive this award than the more valuable, unrestricted award.</p>



<p>The researchers then investigated whether these findings were generalisable to other minority groups. This time, they looked at women applicants’ choice of grant. The method was identical to that of study one, except that the diversity award’s description now specified it was for women applicants only. New follow-up questions probed participants’ feelings of how biased those awarding the grants may be, and what they may write in an application essay.</p>



<p>Again, participants tended to choose the larger award when neither was billed as a diversity award (73%). But, when the smaller grant was labelled as a diversity award for women applicants, it once again attracted the majority of applications (61.9%). And, as in the first study, this group appeared to be going for the diversity award because they felt that they fit better within the intended pool of applicants, rather than for any other reason (such as beliefs about the fairness of the evaluators).</p>



<p>In the final study, the team took a closer look at the real-world behavioural consequences of these findings. Female participants (N=152) were given the opportunity to write 500-word essays for the chance to win either one or two grants, valued at $30 and $20. In one condition, these were both unrestricted, and in another, the smaller grant was labelled as a diversity grant. Participants were asked which of the essays they would like to work on first, and after completing the first essay, were given the option to continue, or to leave the study having applied for just their first choice.</p>



<p>Perhaps unsurprisingly, given the effort of essay writing, 31% of participants chose to leave after applying for just one of the grants. When both grants were unrestricted, 87.7% prioritised the larger grant. However, in line with the previous findings, only 50% of participants prioritised the larger award when a diversity award was also presented. Of those that chose to complete both application essays, 90.9% prioritised the larger amount when no diversity option was offered, versus a miniscule 39.1% when one was present.</p>



<p>These findings suggest a stark dilemma. In providing explicit diversity opportunities, organisations may inadvertently be siphoning diverse talent away from more lucrative awards and opportunities. This could leave those from privileged backgrounds more likely to receive larger significant grants, which may even have an exponential effect, as additional benefits are often more readily afforded to those in receipt of prestigious awards.</p>



<p>Furthermore, though this study didn’t explicitly test this phenomenon within a disabled population, the final study hints at the potential problems this effect may pose for this group. The physical effort of applying for awards, compounded by this prioritisation of lower value diversity awards, may place such candidates in an especially inequitable position. This may be a fruitful and informative avenue for further research, and could lead to the development of more robust equity measures.</p>



<p>This study highlights the need for thorough consideration and assessment of the application of diversity initiatives. There are clearly other factors to consider too; for example, it may be the case that diversity grants encourage a larger number of diverse candidates to apply for awards in the first place. However, these findings strongly underline the necessity for proper analysis and monitoring of grant applications to ensure the intended effect is achieved.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/vortex-beam-atom-molecule-quantum-physics">New ‘vortex beams’ of atoms and molecules are the first of their kind</a></h4>

              
                <p>Like soft serve ice cream, beams of atoms and molecules now come with a swirl.</p>



<p>Scientists already knew how to dish up spiraling beams of light or electrons, known as <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/twisted-way-take-pictures">vortex beams</a> (<em>SN: 1/14/11</em>). Now, <a href="http://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.abj2451">the first vortex beams of atoms and molecules</a> are on the menu, researchers report in the Sept. 3 <em>Science</em>.</p>



<p>Vortex beams made of light or electrons have shown promise for making special types of microscope images and for <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/quantum-communication-takes-new-twist">transmitting information</a> using quantum physics (<em>SN: 8/5/15</em>). But vortex beams of larger particles such as atoms or molecules are so new that the possible applications aren’t yet clear, says physicist Sonja Franke-Arnold of the University of Glasgow in Scotland, who was not involved with the research. “It’s maybe too early to really know what we can do with it.”</p>



<p>In quantum physics, particles are <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/wave-function-directly-measured">described by a wave function</a>, a wavelike pattern that allows scientists to calculate the probability of finding a particle in a particular place (<em>SN: 6/8/11</em>). But vortex beams’ waves don’t slosh up and down like ripples on water. Instead, the beams’ particles have wave functions that move in a corkscrewing motion as a beam travels through space. That means the beam carries a rotational oomph known as orbital angular momentum. “This is something really very strange, very nonintuitive,” says physicist Edvardas Narevicius of the Weizmann Institute of Science in Rehovot, Israel.</p>





<p>Narevicius and colleagues created the new beams by passing helium atoms through a grid of specially shaped slit patterns, each just 600 nanometers wide. The team detected a hallmark of vortex beams: a row of doughnut-shaped rings imprinted on a detector by the atoms, in which each doughnut corresponds to a beam with a different orbital angular momentum.</p>



<p>Another set of doughnuts revealed the presence of vortex beams of helium excimers, molecules created when a helium atom in an excited, or energized, state pairs up with another helium atom.</p>

<p>Next, scientists might investigate what happens when vortex beams of molecules or atoms collide with light, electrons or other atoms or molecules. Such collisions are well-understood for normal particle beams, but not for those with orbital angular momentum. Similar vortex beams made with protons might also serve as a method for probing the subatomic particle’s <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/theres-still-lot-we-dont-know-about-proton">mysterious innards</a> (<em>SN: 4/18/17</em>).</p>



<p>In physics, “most important things are achieved when we are revisiting known phenomena with a fresh perspective,” says physicist Ivan Madan of EPFL, the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Lausanne, who was not involved with the research. “And, for sure, this experiment allows us to do that.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/astronomy-star-swallow-black-hole-supernova-cosmology">Astronomers may have seen a star gulp down a black hole and explode</a></h4>

              
                <p>For the first time, astronomers have captured solid evidence of a rare double cosmic cannibalism — a star swallowing a compact object such as a black hole or neutron star. In turn, that object gobbled the star’s core, causing it to explode and leave behind only a black hole.</p>



<p>The first hints of the gruesome event, described in the Sept. 3 <em>Science</em>, <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.abg6037">came from the Very Large Array</a> (VLA), a radio telescope consisting of 27 enormous dishes in the New Mexican desert near Socorro. During the observatory’s scans of the night sky in 2017, a burst of radio energy as bright as the brightest exploding star — or supernova — as seen from Earth appeared in a dwarf star–forming galaxy approximately 500 million light-years away.</p>



<p>“We thought, ‘Whoa, this is interesting,’” says Dillon Dong, an astronomer at Caltech.</p>



<p>He and his colleagues made follow-up observations of the galaxy using the VLA and one of the telescopes at the W.M. Keck Observatory in Hawaii, which sees in the same optical light as our eyes. The Keck telescope caught a luminous outflow of material spewing in all directions at 3.2 million kilometers per hour from a central location, suggesting that an energetic explosion had occurred there in the past.</p>





<p>The team then found an extremely bright X-ray source in archival data from the Monitor of All Sky X-ray Image (MAXI) telescope, a Japanese instrument that sits on the International Space Station. This X-ray burst was in the same place as the radio one but had been observed back in 2014. &nbsp;</p>



<p>Piecing the data together, Dong and his colleagues think this is what happened: Long ago, a binary pair of stars were born orbiting each other; one died in a spectacular supernova and became either a neutron star or a black hole. As gravity brought the two objects closer together, the dead star actually entered the outer layers of its larger stellar sibling.</p>



<p>The compact object spiraled inside the still-living star for hundreds of years, eventually making its way down to and then eating its partner’s core. During this time, the larger star shed huge amounts of gas and dust, forming a shell of material around the duo.</p>



<p>In the living star’s center, gravitational forces and complex magnetic interactions from the dead star’s munching launched enormous jets of energy — picked up as an X-ray flash in 2014 — as well as causing the larger star to explode. Debris from the detonation smashed with colossal speed into the surrounding shell of material, generating the optical and radio light.</p>



<p>While theorists have previously envisioned such a scenario, dubbed a merger-triggered core collapse supernova, this appears to represent the first direct observation of this phenomenon, Dong says.</p>



<p>“They’ve done some pretty good detective work using these observations,” says Adam Burrows, an astrophysicist at Princeton University who was not involved in the new study. He says the findings should help constrain the timing of <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00159-013-0059-2">a process called common envelope evolution</a>, in which one star becomes immersed inside another. Such stages in stars’ lives are relatively short-lived in cosmic time and difficult to both observe and simulate. Most of the time, the engulfing partner dies before its core is consumed, leading to two compact objects like white dwarfs, neutron stars or black holes orbiting one another.</p>



<p>The final stages of these systems are exactly what observatories like the Advanced Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory, or LIGO, detect when <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/gravitational-wave-ligo-virgo-new-signals-ripples-spacetime">capturing spacetime’s ripples</a>, Dong says (<em>SN: 8/4/21</em>). Now that astronomers know to look for these multiple lines of evidence, he expects them to find more examples this strange phenomenon.</p>

                <p>Beam a black light into some Vietnamese forests at night, and brilliant green bulbs may glow in the trees. These eerie lanterns are the nests of several species of Asian paper wasps, and the gleam comes from <a href="https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rsif.2021.0418">silk fibers in the nests</a> that fluoresce when struck by ultraviolet light, researchers report in the August <em>Journal of the Royal Society Interface</em>.</p>



<p>“When you see it, it&#8217;s just magic,” says chemist Bernd Schöllhorn of the Molecular Electrochemistry Lab at the University of Paris and CNRS.</p>



<p>Schöllhorn and colleagues discovered the nests while searching forests in Vietnam for fluorescent insects using powerful UV torches. “It looked like somebody turned on a flashlight in the forest, but nobody was there,” he says.</p>

<p>Fluorescence occurs throughout the animal kingdom. <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/platypus-glow-blue-green-ultraviolet-light-fluorescent-fur">Platypuses</a>, scorpions and <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/first-fluorescent-frogs-might-see-each-others-glow">polka dot tree frogs</a>, for example, all fluoresce under UV light (<em>SN: 11/6/20; SN: 4/3/17</em>). After analyzing the fluorescence of the nests of some Asian paper wasps (<em>Polistes </em>spp.) in the lab, the researchers found that silk threads in the nests glow more brilliantly than other documented fluorescent biomaterials.</p>



<p>The nests of one wasp species, <em>P. brunetus</em>, emitted about one-third as much light as they absorbed. And in some cases, the nests were visible by the naked eye from up to 20 meters away. “We haven&#8217;t seen any other example like that,” Schöllhorn says. The fluorescence must benefit the wasps somehow, the researchers say, though it’s unclear how. One hypothesis is that the nests protect larvae inside from UV radiation by absorbing some of the harmful energy and <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/tardigrade-water-bear-glow-blue-ultraviolet-light">dissipating it as visible light</a>, Schöllhorn says (<em>SN: 10/13/20</em>). Or, as the sun directly casts its last UV light at the end of the day, the nests might shine bright enough amid the darkening foliage to help wayward wasps find home, like beacons at twilight.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2021/09/02/tackling-income-inequality-could-boost-childrens-vocabulary/">Tackling Income Inequality Could Boost Children’s Vocabulary</a></h4>

              
                <p><em>By </em><a href="http://emilyoliviareynolds.com/">Emily Reynolds</a></p>



<p>In 1995, a seminal book was <a href="https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=I2pHAAAAMAAJ&amp;redir_esc=y">published</a> suggesting that children from lower socioeconomic backgrounds were exposed to 30 million fewer words than richer children by the age of 4 — the so-called &#8220;word gap&#8221;. The idea is now widespread and has informed early childhood policy in the United States (though the findings are more <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/education/archive/2018/06/the-long-contentious-history-of-the-word-gap-study/562850/">contentious</a> than this ubiquity might suggest).</p>



<p>But why might these kids be exposed to fewer words? A <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/epdf/10.1111/desc.13151?saml_referrer">new study</a> from a team at the University of California, Berkeley, finds that worries about financial insecurity reduced the amount that caregivers spoke to their small children, suggesting that these concerns themselves could be at least partly responsible for the word gap.</p>



<span id="more-43457"></span>



<p>Participants were 84 caregivers and their three year old children. First, a caregiver and their child were seated across from each other at a table, and while the child completed an unrelated experiment with a researcher, caregivers were placed into one of two conditions.</p>



<p>In the scarcity condition, caregivers were asked to reflect on three or four times in the past week when they didn’t have enough of something or when resources were scarce, writing a brief reflection about two of those experiences. In the control condition, caregivers wrote about two things they had done in the last week.</p>



<p>When the caregiver had completed the survey, they were left alone with their child and a shape sorting puzzle which allowed, but didn’t obligate, them to engage in speech. A video camera recorded their interactions, with researchers using transcripts to analyse the quantity and quality of language used by caregivers.</p>



<p>Results showed that those in the scarcity condition used fewer words than those in the control condition as well as fewer word <em>types</em> (e.g. nouns, adjectives, and other categories), though this latter difference was not statistically significant. Interestingly, caregivers who reflected specifically on <em>financial</em> insecurity spoke to their children significantly less than those who focused on other forms of scarcity (such as time).</p>



<p>A second study looked at more natural, daily environments, using publicly available audio recordings of children and their caregivers taken over multiple days. The team looked specifically at changes in conversation towards the end of the month, which previous research has identified as a period when people of all income groups are less financially secure.</p>



<p>Across all of the recordings, back and forth interactions between caregivers and children were reduced during the last week of the month. Children themselves were also on average less likely to use language during this week compared to the rest of the month, though adult speech overall was not reduced during this period. The results also held for caregivers from all financial brackets.</p>



<p>Though the end of the month may, on the whole, be a time of relative financial stress, the study was not able to isolate this as the key factor in reduced speech; further research could look more closely at times of difference in vocalisation between caregivers and children, using specific measures of financial stress to understand the link.</p>



<p>The findings could go some way to explain <em>why</em> parents who are struggling financially might talk less to their children. The team suggests that parents have less time and attention to speak to their children when stressed or anxious. “If you are worried about putting food on the table, or scraping together money for that medical bill, or figuring out where to enroll your child in school now you have been evicted, you may be less likely to narrate the colour of the sky to your child as you ride on the bus,” they write.</p>



<p>As noted, however, there are also issues with the concept of the word gap altogether: <a href="https://srcd.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/cdev.13072">recent longitudinal research</a> failed to replicate the findings of the 1995 study, suggesting it may not be as cut and dry as assumed. But limitations aside, there is certainly one serious takeaway from the study: the importance of considering external, material factors on childcare and parenting. While individual interventions may solicit some positive results, looking at wider social and political factors could be a better way of addressing childhood inequalities than putting the onus on individuals.</p>



<p>&#8211; <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/epdf/10.1111/desc.13151?saml_referrer">What causes the word gap? Financial concerns may systematically suppress child-directed speech</a></p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/fire-amazon-rainforest-threatened-species-deforestation-biodiversity">Fires may have affected up to 85 percent of threatened Amazon species</a></h4>

              
                <p>Much of the Amazon’s biodiversity is under fire — literally.</p>



<p>In the last two decades, deforestation and forest <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-021-03876-7">fires have encroached on the ranges of thousands of plant and animal species</a> in the Amazon rainforest, including up to 85 percent of threatened species in the region, researchers report September 1 in <em>Nature</em>.</p>



<p>The extent of the damage is closely tied to the enforcement, or lack thereof, of regulations in Brazil aimed at protecting the forest from widespread logging as well as the fires often used to clear open space in the forest and other encroachments. The findings illustrate the key role that forest use regulations have in the fate of the Amazon rainforest, the researchers argue.</p>



<p>Threats to the survival of this biodiversity could have long-term effects. Biodiversity boosts a forest’s resilience to drought, says Arie Staal, an ecologist at Utrecht University in the Netherlands who was not involved with this research. A deep bench of tree species allows the plants to replace those that may not survive drought conditions, he says. “If fire-impacted area continues to rise, not only does the Amazon lose forest cover, but also some of its capacity to cope with the changing climate.”</p>





<p>And as fires advance deeper into the rainforest, more species will experience fire for the first time, Staal says. “These species, including many threatened ones, have not evolved under circumstances with regular fires, so the consequences for those species can be severe.” Such consequences may include increased risk of population declines or extinction, similar to the <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/australia-wildfires-extinction-threat-species-one-year-later">fears following the major outbreak of fires in Australia</a> in 2019 and 2020 (<em>SN: 3/9/21</em>).</p>



<p>In recent decades, ongoing <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/many-amazon-trees-endangered">deforestation</a> and periodic drought in the Amazon basin have been associated with intensifying fires there (<em>SN: 11/20/15</em>). In 2019, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/brazil-amazon-rainforest-fires-climate-emissions-oxygen">a particularly severe series of fires</a> scorched the region (<em>SN: 8/23/19</em>).&nbsp;</p>



<p>“But we do not know how fires are impacting the biodiversity across the Amazon basin,” says Xiao Feng, a biogeographer at Florida State University in Tallahassee.&nbsp;The Amazon “is a huge area, and it is generally impossible for people to go there and count the number of species before the fire and after the fire,” he says. “That’s an incredible amount of work.”</p>



<p>So Feng and a team of collaborators from Brazil, China, the Netherlands and the United States instead investigated how Amazonian plant and animal species’ geographic ranges have been exposed to recent fires. The team compiled range maps of 11,514 plant and 3,079 vertebrate species, creating what may be the most comprehensive dataset of range maps for the Amazon. The team compared these maps with satellite images of Amazon forest cover from 2001 to 2019. Those images let the team track how logging and fires have led to the degradation of rainforest habitat.</p>



<p>Fire impacted up to about 190,000 square kilometers — an area roughly the size of Washington state, the team found. Up to about 95 percent of the species featured in the study had ranges that overlapped with fires during this period, though for many species, burned areas made up less than 15 percent of their overall range.</p>



<p>Affected species include up to 85 percent of the 610 considered threatened — so vulnerable to extinction or already endangered or critically endangered — by the International Union for Conservation of Nature. This category includes as many as 264 kinds of plants, 107 amphibians and 55 mammals. In 2019 alone, over 12,000 species experienced fire somewhere in their geographic range.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Starting in 2009, when a series of regulations aimed at reducing deforestation started being enforced, the extent of fires generally decreased, except in drought years, the team found. Then in 2019, fires ticked back up again, coinciding with a relaxation of regulations. Much of the fire-driven forest loss was congregated along the more intensely logged southern reaches of the rainforest.</p>



<p>The shift suggests that effective forest preservation policies can slow this trend of destruction, and may be crucial for preventing the region from reaching a <a href="https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/full/10.1098/rstb.2007.0036?ct=">tipping point</a>. That point would occur when the cycle of deforestation, drying and fire triggers widespread transformation of the Amazon basin into a savanna-like habitat.</p>



<p>While this study couldn’t track the fate of specific plants or animals, Feng now plans to look at fire’s impact on certain groups of species that may have very different vulnerabilities to an increasingly flammable Amazon. “We know some trees may be more resistant to burns, but some may not. So it may also be really important to distinguish differences,” he says.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/arabia-stone-age-tools-humans-migration-green-lakes-desert">Stone Age humans or their relatives occasionally trekked through a green Arabia</a></h4>

              
                <p>Arabia, known today for its desert landscape, served as a “green turnstile” for migrating Stone Age members of the human genus starting around 400,000 years ago, a new study finds.</p>



<p>Monsoon rains periodically turned northern Arabia into a well-watered oasis, creating windows of opportunity for long-ago humans or their relatives to trek through that crossroads region from starting points in northern Africa and southwest Asia.</p>



<p>That’s the implication of a series of five ancient lake beds of varying ages, each accompanied by distinctive stone tools, unearthed at a northern Saudi Arabian site called Khall Amayshan 4, or KAM 4. Sediments from the lake beds, which were linked to periods when the climate was wetter than today, also yielded fossils of hippos, wild cattle and other animals. Like hominids, those creatures must have <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-021-03863-y">migrated into the region along rain-fed lakes</a>, wetlands and rivers, an international team reports online September 1 in <em>Nature</em>.</p>



<p>Until now, the oldest stone tools in Arabia <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/ancient-homo-stone-tools-north-africa-arabia-early">dated to at least 300,000 years ago</a> (<em>SN: 11/29/18</em>). Previous finds only hinted that Stone Age <em>Homo sapiens</em> or other <em>Homo</em> species temporarily inhabited green, wetter parts of Arabia, a conclusion largely resting on discoveries <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/fossils-hint-hominids-migrated-through-green-arabia-300000-years-ago">at two other Saudi sites, each preserving stone tools from a single point in time</a> (<em>SN: 11/1/18</em>).</p>



<p>Aside from providing the earliest known evidence of hominids in Arabia, the new finds demonstrate for the first time that ancient <em>Homo</em> groups traveled there when conditions turned wet, say archaeologist Huw Groucutt of the Max Planck Institute for the Science of Human History in Jena, Germany, and colleagues.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" width="680" height="383" src="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/083121_bb_hominids-arabia_inline2.jpg" alt="Khall Amayshan 4 site pictured from above" class="wp-image-3103164" srcset="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/083121_bb_hominids-arabia_inline2.jpg 680w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/083121_bb_hominids-arabia_inline2-330x186.jpg 330w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><figcaption><span class="caption wp-caption-3103164">Evidence of hominid occupations at five ancient lake sites, each dated to a different Stone Age time, was found at northern Saudi Arabia’s Khall Amayshan 4 site (shown).</span><span class="credit wp-credit-3103164">Michael Petraglia/Palaeodeserts Project</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>As a result, northern Arabia could have served as a key, if intermittent, passageway out of Africa for humans or close evolutionary relatives <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/sharp-stones-found-india-signal-surprisingly-early-toolmaking-advances">who reached South Asia by around 385,000 years ago</a> (<em>SN: 1/31/18</em>), <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/long-going-europe-humans-ventured-east-asia">southern China between 120,000 and 80,000 years ago</a> (<em>SN: 10/14/15</em>) and <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/blog/science-ticker/ancient-people-arrived-sumatra-rainforests-more-60000-years-ago">the Indonesian island of Sumatra between 73,000 and 63,000 years ago</a> (<em>SN: 8/9/17</em>).</p>



<p>The number, completeness and time frames of KAM 4’s ancient lake deposits make this site “one of a kind … that will continue to produce remarkable results,” says archaeologist Donald Henry of the University of Tulsa in Oklahoma, who did not participate in the new study.</p>





<p>Across five occupation phases covering hundreds of thousands of years, different <em>Homo</em> species or closely related populations at KAM 4 “were doing broadly the same things,” Groucutt says. Small groups camped by lakes where individuals made stone tools for food preparation, hunting and woodworking.</p>



<p>But each phase, dated mainly by a technique that estimated the amount of time since grains of lake sediment had last been exposed to sunlight, had its own evolutionary character.</p>



<p>For example, the identity of the KAM 4 crowd 400,000 years ago, who left behind large hand axes, is unclear, but the researchers know it couldn’t have been <em>H. sapiens</em>. <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/oldest-known-homo-sapiens-fossils-come-northern-africa-studies-claim">Our species didn’t originate until roughly 300,000 years ago in Africa</a> (<em>SN: 6/7/17</em>). One possibility is that those ancient Arabians represented a now-extinct <em>Homo</em> population from southwest Asia that later migrated into Africa, possibly contributing to <em>H. sapiens</em> evolution, Groucutt speculates.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" width="680" height="316" src="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/083121_bb_hominids-arabia_inline1.jpg" alt="a stone hand axe shown from four different angles" class="wp-image-3103165" srcset="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/083121_bb_hominids-arabia_inline1.jpg 680w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/083121_bb_hominids-arabia_inline1-330x153.jpg 330w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><figcaption><span class="caption wp-caption-3103165">Members of an unidentified <em>Homo</em> group left behind stone hand axes such this one (shown from different angles) along the shore of a northern Arabian lake about 400,000 years ago.</span><span class="credit wp-credit-3103165">Ian Cartwright/Palaeodeserts Project</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>Similar but slightly smaller, more finely worked hand axes turned up along the shore of a roughly 300,000-year-old KAM 4 lake bed, indicating a second phase of occupation. Groucutt and colleagues doubt that early <em>H. sapiens </em>from Africa scurried over to KAM 4 in time to make those tools. Whichever <em>Homo</em> group did could have come either from northern Africa or southwest Asia, the researchers say.</p>



<p>A third round of KAM 4 occupants, probably <em>H. sapiens</em>, fashioned artifacts excavated at an approximately 200,000-year-old lake bed, Groucutt says. These finds consist of rock chunks shaped so that sharp flakes, also unearthed there, could be pounded off. Humans based in northeastern Africa around that time made similar tools. Some of those people may have reached Arabia before eventually journeying to southwest Asia, Groucutt suggests.</p>



<p>Groucutt’s group excavated comparable tools at a site called Jubbah about 150 kilometers east of KAM 4 that date to around 210,000 years ago. Those finds are another sign of human migrations into Arabia at a time when the corresponding KAM 4 lake bed shows that wet conditions reigned. Additional stone tools unearthed at Jubbah date to around 75,000 years ago.</p>



<p>Stone implements resembling the Jubbah finds were also excavated at the youngest two KAM 4 sites, one dating to between about 125,000 and 75,000 years ago and the other to roughly 55,000 years ago. The older site likely hosted <em>H. sapiens</em>, possibly a group that left Africa, Groucutt suggests.</p>



<p>The youngest KAM 4 artifacts could represent either <em>H. sapiens</em> or Neandertals, he says. Neandertals reached the Middle East by about 70,000 years ago and could have reached a green Arabia by 55,000 years ago. If so, Neandertals may have interbred with <em>H. sapiens</em> in Arabia, a possibility not raised before.</p>



<p>Despite uncertainties about which hominids reached KAM 4 during its green phases, KAM 4 tools generally look more like similarly aged African tools than artifacts previously found in southern Arabia or at eastern Mediterranean sites, says Henry, the University of Tulsa archaeologist. Migrations out of Africa, he says, now appear more likely to have wended through northern Arabia rather than across a narrow Red Sea crossing to southern Arabia, often regarded as a major dispersal route for ancient humans.</p>

                <img width="140" height="110" src="https://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2021/09/Melissa-Willoughby_blog-featured-image-140x110.jpg" class="attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image" alt="" style="display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear:both;" /><p><em>Welcome to our <strong>SDG Editorial Board Members</strong> blog collection. We are hearing from the Editorial Board Members of the BMC Series journals whose work aligns with achieving the Sustainable Development Goals. Here you can find other posts in this collection, grouped with the tag ‘SDG editorial board members‘.</em></p>
<hr />
<p>Violence is a complex issue that remains a public health priority globally. Violence is not equally distributed across society but disproportionately impacts people who face health and social inequities. People who experience health and social inequities, such as homelessness, unemployment, mental illness and substance use disorders, are also more likely to have contact with the criminal justice system.</p>
<p>My PhD research examines how we can prevent deaths and injuries from violence among adults and young people who have had contact with the criminal justice system in Australia. My work primarily relates to SDG 5, achieving gender equality and empowerment for all women and girls and SDG 16, promoting peaceful and inclusive societies. Preventing violence and deaths from violence is specified in three targets to achieve these goals. Target 5.2 aims to eliminate all forms of violence against women and girls, target 16.1 aims to reduce deaths from violence and target 16.2 aims to end all forms of violence against children.</p>
<p>A key challenge for this research is that the violence experienced by people who have had contact with the criminal justice system is rarely recognized as a health issue. This is despite violence being declared a priority for public health by the <a href="https://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/handle/10665/42495/9241545615_eng.pdf">World Health Organization</a> almost two decades ago, and <a href="https://www.euro.who.int/__data/assets/pdf_file/0007/98971/E94242.pdf">health of those who had had contact with the criminal justice system</a> being recognized as an important part of public health.</p>
<p>If we are to uphold the United Nations pledge of <em>‘<a href="https://sdgs.un.org/2030agenda">leaving no one behind’</a></em>, then we must consider the violence experienced by this population as a serious health issue in need of targeted, evidence-informed prevention efforts. <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/0886260520905546">My research</a> has established that people who have contact with the criminal justice system have a risk of dying from violence that is far greater than the risk experienced by the general population in Australia.</p>
<p>Ignoring the violence experienced by this population ignores the connection between health, violence and criminal justice system involvement. Many adults and young people who have experienced incarceration were victims of violence <em>before</em> they had contact with the criminal justice system. The <a href="https://www.anrows.org.au/publication/womens-imprisonment-and-domestic-family-and-sexual-violence/">vast majority (70-90%) of women</a> in prison have been victims of violence, most frequently intimate partner and family violence. For many of these people their violence victimization was connected to the reasons for their criminal justice system involvement. For example, people may turn to substance use as a coping strategy after being a victim of violence and are then subsequently charged with using or possessing substances. Young people may leave their home and become homeless after experiencing family violence, which in turn may increase the likelihood that they have contact with the criminal justice system.</p>
<p>We need to challenge and address the stigma that people who have had contact with the criminal justice experience, which continues long after their contact with the system. People who have had contact with the criminal justice system are part of the community and do not exist separately from it. Even those who are incarcerated usually only spend a relatively short period of time in prison before being released back into the community. As such, improving the health of this population and reducing the violence they experience is likely important to reducing health inequities at the population level and achieving SDGs 5 and 16.</p>
<p>People who have had contact with the criminal justice system need to be recognized as a priority group for violence prevention. Additionally, the health and social inequities that are drivers of death and injuries of violence, as well as criminal justice system involvement need to be addressed.</p>
<p>The impact of experiencing violence on health and behavior must be considered when people have contact with the criminal justice system. Our criminal justice systems need to be <a href="http://www.nasmhpd.org/sites/default/files/Women%20in%20Corrections%20TIC%20SR(2).pdf">trauma-informed and include trauma-informed responses</a>, which includes diversion to more appropriate services, such as mental health and family violence services. Without which, we may be further entrenching a cycle of disadvantage and violence in this population.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/good-life-happy-meaning-richness-change-experiences-psychology">Perspective-changing experiences, good or bad, can lead to richer lives</a></h4>

              
                <p class="has-drop-cap" style="font-size:20px">In December, my husband, our 5-year-old daughter and I tested positive for COVID-19. Life, already off-kilter, lurched. Smell, taste, breath — were they normal? The air smelled only of cold; everything tasted vaguely of cardboard.</p>



<p>The state mailed us a pulse oximeter to read oxygen levels from our fingers. The device beeped when those levels dipped too low — a seemingly objective measure during a subjective time. We used the device with abandon, only my husband regularly triggering the alarm. He went to bed, where he stayed for days, or maybe it was weeks. Time distilled into moments: remote school, meals, Christmas, pulse-ox, beep.</p>



<p>We exited quarantine on January 1, the day of fresh starts. Except my once energetic 8-year-old son, who somehow never tested positive, now loafed in front of the heater for hours. My husband, his breathing still abnormal and his fatigue lingering, raged. Ever the extrovert, I absorbed their emotions as my own. My risk calculation shifted, as despair overshadowed the fear of disease. The sickness we had hid from for so long had found us anyway. Were we now immune? Should we proceed just as before?</p>



<p>Prior to the sickness, I’d been researching <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/social-distancing-boredom-covid-19-public-health-pandemic">pandemic fatigue</a>, a term used to describe the boredom that can arise during a protracted crisis like the one we’re in now (<em>SN Online: 2/15/21</em>). “People prefer action to inaction,” social psychologist Erin Westgate of the University of Florida in Gainesville told me. For some, that compulsion toward the experiential runs deep, she and colleagues reported in 2014 in <em>Science</em>. When the researchers gave college students a choice between sitting idly in a quiet room or <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4330241/">pushing a button to receive an electric shock</a>, a startling number went for the shock.</p>



<p>I have been seeking, and pushing, that button all my life. I’ve taught English in Japan, worked as a national park ranger and, following an unfortunate series of events, sold pineapples along a tourist highway in Hawaii in exchange for a tent over my head. Westgate’s recent work suggests that button pushing sorts often flourish in rich and aesthetic environs. I took heed. Against the dreary backdrop of being homebound in a global health crisis, I signed up for private pottery lessons, drawn viscerally to the idea of creating something from mud.</p>

<h4>A third path</h4>



<p>Psychologists who study well-being or human flourishing have long posited that the “good life” can be pursued via two paths: happiness or meaning.</p>





<p>“So far, psychologists worked with this dichotomy — a dichotomous model of well-being about life,” says psychologist Shigehiro Oishi. He describes the happy life as one of joy, comfort and security, and the meaningful life as one of significance, purpose and coherence, or order. Happiness and meaning can run parallel or intersect, Oishi says. Both concepts are largely rooted in personal and societal stability.</p>



<p>What happens, though, when the ground beneath one’s feet buckles? Or what if one was never quite stable to begin with? What hope is there for finding a path to the good life?</p>



<p>For the last six years, Oishi and his team at the University of Virginia in Charlottesville have been hammering out their response: a third path to the good life coined “psychological richness.” Their research suggests that the ingredients of a rich life come not from stability in life circumstances or in temperament. Rather, the path to a rich life arises from novelty seeking, curiosity and moments that shift one’s view of the world. Rich experiences are neither inherently good nor bad; they may be intentional or accidental, joyous or traumatic.</p>



<p>The pandemic, in this light, embodies a novel, perspective-changing, psychologically rich moment. It has shattered our routines and livelihoods, robbed us of our loved ones and plunged many into despondency. But it has also steered some of us to the mud. We have captured wild yeast for sourdough breads, planted gardens and knitted sweaters; we have stared at a wet mound of clay on a wheel and wondered, what next?</p>



<p>This third good life path can provide a balm in difficult times, says Westgate, Oishi’s former graduate student. “Psychological richness opens up an avenue to the good life for people for whom circumstances may seem to have cut off paths to happiness and meaning.”</p>



<h4>Aristotle’s legacy </h4>



<p>If you want to understand psychological richness, read about Oliver Sacks, advises Lorraine Besser, a philosopher at Middlebury College in Vermont and Oishi’s collaborator. She is thinking of <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2015/02/19/opinion/oliver-sacks-on-learning-he-has-terminal-cancer.html">an adieu to the world</a> that Sacks wrote in the <em>New York Times</em> in February 2015, shortly after learning he was dying of cancer.</p>



<p>The renowned author and neurologist drew his inspiration from philosopher David Hume, who had written a similar adieu in 1776. Hume described himself as possessing a “mild disposition,” Sacks wrote. “Here I depart from Hume. While I have enjoyed loving relationships and friendships and have no real enmities, I cannot say (nor would anyone who knows me say) that I am a man of mild dispositions. On the contrary, I am a man of vehement disposition, with violent enthusiasms, and extreme immoderation in all my passions.”</p>



<p>Ancient discussions of the good life do not appear to consider Sacks’ model. Instead, fourth century B.C. Greek philosopher Aristotle looms large in this esoteric space. He opens his treatise, Nicomachean Ethics, by <a href="http://classics.mit.edu/Aristotle/nicomachaen.html">reviewing the various contenders for the good life</a> — pleasure, honor, wealth, health or eminence — eventually arriving at “eudaimonia,” essentially human flourishing. The eudaimonic person, Aristotle wrote, “is active in accordance with complete virtue … not for some unspecified period but throughout a complete life.”</p>





<p>Of those contenders, only pleasure and eudaimonia, the “feeling good and being good” sides of that dichotomous coin, have withstood the long test of time, Westgate says.</p>



<p>Aristotle, an unequivocal be-gooder, considered the good life an objective ideal. So does Susan Wolf. “Some philosophers, including me, say a good life isn’t just good from the inside,” says Wolf, a moral philosopher at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. Instead, a life must also be good from the outside, or from the perspective of one’s community.</p>



<p>But the emergence of positive psychology several decades ago shifted attention from the collective to the individual. Now, Westgate says, “whether or not it’s a good life is really in the eyes of the person who led that life.”</p>



<h4>Sacks’ vision </h4>



<p>Sacks’ early years were marked by heartache, according to <a href="https://www.pbs.org/wnet/americanmasters/stream-oliver-sacks-his-own-life-documentary/17521/">a documentary of his life</a> that aired on PBS in April. Born in 1933 in London, Sacks was sent to a boarding school during World War II, where the other children bullied him and his older brother, Michael. In that environment, Michael became psychotic and was diagnosed with schizophrenia. The family was devastated. Then, when Sacks was 18, his parents discovered he was gay. His mother, with whom he shared a close bond, called him an “abomination.”</p>



<p>“Her words haunted me for much of my life and played a major part in inhibiting and injecting with guilt my sense of my own sexuality,” Sacks said.</p>



<p>Sacks fled to San Francisco on his 27th birthday and interned at a medical center. Off hours, Sacks muscled up, eventually lifting a 600-pound bar from a squat to set a California weight lifting record. He also got hooked on amphetamines, thereby sleeping and eating little, while roaring high and fast on his motorcycle. Sacks, the documentary suggests, was running from his own overwhelming loneliness.</p>



<p>“That kind of sensitivity is dangerous. It requires a degree of appetite, vitality, a responsiveness, which means that you could go off the rails at any moment,” the documentary’s director Ric Burns tells me. “The question becomes: What is the relationship you’re going to have to your own appetites?”</p>

<p>On New Year’s Eve 1965, Sacks stared into the abyss of his drug addiction. “I looked at my emaciated face and I said, ‘Oliver, you will not see another New Year’s Day unless you get help,’ ” Sacks recalled in the documentary.</p>



<p>Six months later, Sacks began seeing migraine patients at a clinic in New York City. During what would turn out to be his last amphetamine high, Sacks read a 500-page book on the theory behind migraines, with detailed case studies, written by physician Edward Liveing in the 1870s. “I read through the whole book in a state of ecstasy,” Sacks said. “With the amphetamines in me, sometimes it seemed to me that the neurological heavens opened and that the migraine was shining like a constellation in the sky.”</p>



<p>After that vision, Sacks began writing detailed accounts of his patients’ experiences, a process that merged his intellectual and creative passions. Embarking on this psychologically rich literary journey would sustain Sacks throughout his life.</p>



<h4>Beyond the dichotomy </h4>



<p>In fall 2015, Westgate was a graduate student in Oishi’s lab. With lab members squeezed into his tiny office for a meeting, Westgate recalls, Oishi walked in and asked: “Is happiness and meaning all there is?”</p>



<p>That meeting and the ensuing discussion marked a turning point for Oishi. He had, like most well-being researchers, been publishing papers that worked within the happiness-­meaning dichotomy. Yet he had grown disillusioned by those paths’ shortcomings. For instance, why, as research has consistently shown, did happiness hinge on having considerably more money than is strictly necessary? And why did homogenous friend circles give people more happiness and satisfaction in their lives than diverse circles?</p>



<p>After that meeting, Westgate recalls, the team homed in on one question: If you lack money and stability, can you still have a good life?</p>



<p>The team looked for a third path, one filled with rich, aesthetic experiences. First the group <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0092656619300649">developed a scale to measure psychological richness</a>. The scale mirrored those used to measure happiness and meaning. Respondents rank 17 statements from 1 for strongly disagree to 7 for strongly agree. Statements include: “On my deathbed, I am likely to say ‘I had an interesting life’ ” and “My life would make a good novel or movie.” The results, appearing June 2019 in the <em>Journal of Research in Personality</em>, showed that scoring high in a personality trait known as “openness to experience” predicted high richness scores but not necessarily happiness or meaning.</p>



<div class="wp-block-sciencenews-content-sidebar">
<h3>Rich dimensions</h3>



<p>Shigehiro Oishi and colleagues zeroed in on the core dimensions of a psychologically rich life. <strong></strong></p>



<h5>What rings true? </h5>



<p>Below is a sampling of statements Oishi’s team uses to measure a person’s level of psychological richness, or propensity toward novel, perspective-­changing experiences. Participants answer on a scale from 1 (strongly disagree) to 7 (strongly agree).</p>



<ul><li>I have had a lot of novel experiences.</li><li>My life has been full of unique, unusual experiences.</li><li>My life consists of rich, intense moments.</li><li>My life has been dramatic.</li><li>I experience a full range of emotions via first-hand experiences such as travel and attending concerts.</li><li>I have a lot of personal stories to tell others.</li><li>On my deathbed, I am likely to say ‘‘I had an interesting life.”</li><li>On my deathbed, I am likely to say ‘‘I have seen and learned a lot.”</li><li>My life would make a good novel or movie.</li></ul>

</div>



<p>Later research revealed that people high in richness are also emotionally intense, prone to experiencing strong positive and negative emotions. People high in meaning and happiness, meanwhile, experience positive emotions more strongly than negative emotions.</p>



<p>To see how the three paths — happiness, meaning and richness — play out across life, the team evaluated obituaries appearing in the summer of 2016 in the <em>New York Times</em>, the Singapore-based<em> Strait Times</em> and a local Charlottesville newspaper. Research assistants were tasked with describing obituaries using just 12 adjectives, such as “secure” and “comfortable” for happiness, “fulfilling” and “sense of purpose” for meaning and “dramatic” and “eventful” for psychological richness. Obituaries that scored high in psychological richness also scored high in meaning, but not happiness.</p>



<p>The research, appearing online August 12 in <em>Psychological Review</em>, found that major life events, such as divorce, career changes and personal tragedies, <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34383524/">linked to higher richness, but not meaning or happiness</a>.</p>



<p>Still, Oishi and his team needed to answer the obvious: Could such an intense, unpredictable and frequently unhappy life really be a path people desired? The researchers asked more than 3,100 people across nine countries — the United States, Japan, South Korea, India, Singapore, Norway, Portugal, Germany and Angola — to score 15 terms similar to those used in the obituary studies on how closely the terms described their ideal lives on a scale from 1 (not at all) to 7 (very much). A nine-term subset of the 15 terms showed that for most countries, <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s42761-020-00011-z#citeas">people’s ideal life was most characterized by happiness and least characterized by richness</a>, the researchers reported June 2020 in <em>Affective Science</em>. Nonetheless, average richness ratings ranged from 3.7 to 5.62, suggesting that people desired some richness in their lives.</p>



<div class="wp-block-sciencenews-content-sidebar">
<h3>An ideal life </h3>



<p>When asked to describe how well nine terms that are linked to happiness, meaning or richness described their ideal lives, from 1 (not at all) to 7 (very much), average scores among respondents for “rich” words, such as “eventful” and “interesting,” were lower than scores for words describing happiness or meaning, but above the midpoint.</p>

<p>Given that ambiguity, the researchers then forced participants to choose which life they desired most: happy, meaningful or rich. Fifty to 70 percent of respondents chose terms reflecting happiness and 14 to 36 percent chose meaning as their ideal life. Percentages varied by country, but a sizable minority — 7 to 17 percent — <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s42761-020-00011-z">chose a psychologically rich life</a>.</p>



<p>When the researchers asked 1,611 people in the United States and 680 people in South Korea if their lives would have been happier, more meaningful or psychologically richer if they could undo their greatest regret in life, roughly 28 percent of Americans and 35 percent of South Koreans reported that their lives would have been psychologically richer with a do-over.</p>



<p>“That suggests to me that maybe implicit in a lot of people’s desires is psychological richness: ‘I wish I had taken on that opportunity,’ ” Oishi says.</p>

<h3>Choose one </h3>



<p>When forced to choose just one path to a good life, most people, with some variability by country, opt for a life high in happiness, with meaning coming in second. Yet a sizable minority choose psychological richness.</p>

<h4>Puzzle assembly not necessary </h4>



<p>Not everyone, however, accepts the shift from a good life dichotomy to a good life triad. “There’s a bundle of conversations to be had about these conceptually tethered concepts,” says developmental psychologist Anthony Burrow of Cornell University. “Because for some people, isn’t it possible that a psychologically rich life is a life of purpose, is a life of meaning?”</p>



<p>The critique is valid. As the obituary studies showed, richness and its link to major, often negative, life events appears distinct from happiness. But those negative life experiences can foster meaning. A large body of literature shows, for instance, that natural disasters and other traumatic events can trigger a phenomenon known as post-traumatic growth: a transformation that gives people <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/what-we-know-how-mass-trauma-affects-mental-health">a newfound appreciation for life and a desire to help others</a> (<em>SN Online: 4/3/19</em>).</p>



<p>An experiment from several years ago illustrates how this transformation plays out. Before richness was in consideration, behavioral economist Kathleen Vohs of the University of Minnesota in Minneapolis sought to understand meaning and happiness in isolation, which was tricky because happy people also tend to lead lives high in meaning and vice versa. The researchers identified only those variables linked to happiness, such as satisfying one’s needs and wants, or only meaning, such as spending time with one’s children. Their findings, appearing in 2013 in the <em>Journal of Positive Psychology</em>, <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/17439760.2013.830764">revealed that happiness in isolation is linked to a focus on the present</a> while meaning in isolation connects the past, present and future, often through self-reflection.</p>



<p>The distinction between meaning and richness, as such, hinges on whether stitching together the strands of one’s life, or coherence, is essential to building a good life. People who study meaning say yes; Oishi says no, turning to fiction to make his point. In Muriel Barbery’s 2006 novel <em>The Elegance of the Hedgehog</em> and Rabih Alameddine’s 2014<em> An Unnecessary Woman</em>, the main characters are poor and lonely women who are neither interested in making the world a better place nor feel that their experiences add up to some greater whole. Instead, the two women, Renée and Aaliya, pursue lives filled with consuming literature, art and music, Oishi says.</p>



<p>“Both women appreciate moments of ineffable beauty, Proustian moments of elongated time and aesthetics, and lead a life full of inner richness,” he and colleagues wrote in 2019.</p>



<p>Oishi’s proposition is simple, yet radical: Experiences, whether mostly vicarious as with Renée and Aaliya, or firsthand, can offer a good life without summing up to anything greater than their parts.</p>



<p>“Ideally, we want to have all three: happiness, meaning and psychological richness,” Oishi told me in an e-mail. “But having just one is sufficient to lead a good life.”</p>



<div class="wp-block-sciencenews-content-sidebar">
<h3>Three pursuits </h3>



<p>Though there can be overlap, the paths to the good life have different features. Happiness tends to be marked by security, meaning by a sense of purpose and richness by perspective-changing experiences. </p>

<h4>The creative impulse </h4>



<p>After the neurological heavens opened, Sacks published his own book on migraines in 1970. He followed it with <em>Awakenings</em> in 1973, documenting the miraculous recovery and relapse of catatonic patients who began to clap, walk and talk after treatment with a medication for Parkinson’s disease, before fading back into unresponsiveness.</p>



<p>Despite his lifelong intellectual and creative frenzy, Sacks remained ever alone. After a brief fling at age 40, he was celibate for the next 35 years.</p>



<p>“He was not happy. He was creative. He was productive. And he was moving forward,” Burns says. “And I think if one is creative, productive and moving forward, one is moving toward happiness.”</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="alignright size-full"><img loading="lazy" width="680" height="497" src="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/091121_rich-life_inline-5.jpg" alt="Oliver Sacks stands next to Bill Hayes" class="wp-image-3103143" srcset="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/091121_rich-life_inline-5.jpg 680w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/091121_rich-life_inline-5-524x383.jpg 524w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/091121_rich-life_inline-5-616x450.jpg 616w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/091121_rich-life_inline-5-254x186.jpg 254w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><figcaption><span class="caption wp-caption-3103143">Oliver Sacks (left) found psychological richness and meaning, thanks to his writings and interactions with patients.

<p>Though Burns uses the term “creative” casually, the pursuit of art seems uniquely suited to those seeking, or forced into, a rich life. “People who score high in openness to experience tend to lead more creative lives,” says Oshin Vartanian, a cognitive neuroscientist at the University of Toronto.</p>



<p>And Oishi’s work has shown that aesthetic experiences increase richness. For instance, in a 2020 study in the <em>European Journal of Personality</em>, Oishi and colleagues compared richness levels between <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0890207020962334">students studying abroad and students who remained on campus</a>. Though both groups started at the same richness levels, richness scores among the students studying abroad went up after 12 weeks.</p>



<p>Student diaries revealed that the study abroad students participated in considerably more artistic activities, such as going to museums and concerts, than students who remained on campus. Engagement with art, Oishi says, “explained partially why the study abroad group had higher psychological richness.”</p>



<p>As COVID-19 variants ricochet around the globe, a great many people are now like those students studying abroad — not traveling, but dosed in a different kind of richness. Here, in this foreign terrain, we too seek beauty.</p>



<p>Scientists have largely focused on the artistic genius, the prototypic creative, Vartanian says. But the pandemic suggests that we should also study, and encourage, the everyday creative.</p>



<p>Vartanian counts himself among this everyday lot. During the pandemic shutdown, someone gave him a broken play structure for his children. Vartanian couldn’t access the parts he needed to fix it, so he learned how to chisel and do woodwork to get the apparatus in working order. “Doing things I’d never done before,” Vartanian says, “was so greatly satisfying for me.”</p>



<p>I recognize the feeling. When I entered the pottery studio, I knew nothing of the craft. Simply centering the clay on the wheel took me seven lessons. While I can now center small lumps of clay with relative ease, beautiful forms elude me. A half year on, I have thrown misshapen bowls, a smattering of wobbly cups and precarious vases that fold at the neck. I am, at my own life’s midpoint, awash in imperfect vessels.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="alignright size-full"><img loading="lazy" width="680" height="794" src="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/091121_rich-life_inline-6.jpg" alt="image of yellow and blue vases, bowls and cups" class="wp-image-3103142" srcset="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/091121_rich-life_inline-6.jpg 680w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/091121_rich-life_inline-6-328x383.jpg 328w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/091121_rich-life_inline-6-385x450.jpg 385w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/091121_rich-life_inline-6-159x186.jpg 159w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/091121_rich-life_inline-6-497x580.jpg 497w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/091121_rich-life_inline-6-665x776.jpg 665w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><figcaption><span class="caption wp-caption-3103142">Gupta has created an assortment of wobbly vases, bowls and cups.</span><span class="credit wp-credit-3103142">Adam Goodenough</span></figcaption></figure></div>



<h4>Completing the triad </h4>



<p>In the Venn diagram of the good life, Sacks spent much of his time outside all three circles. By midlife, though, psychological richness had become his beacon.</p>



<p>Yet, in crafting his patients’ stories, Sacks made his life about something larger than himself, Burns says. “He turned the mirror around [and said,] ‘I’m going to look outward in order to also look inward.’ ” Sacks had landed at the overlap between richness and meaning.</p>



<p>Then, in his late 70s, Sacks fell deeply, madly in love. After a lifetime of struggle, he finally felt he belonged, not just in literary or academic circles but within himself. In that adieu, Sacks remarked: “My predominant feeling is one of gratitude. I have loved and been loved; I have been given much and I have given something in return; I have read and traveled and thought and written.”</p>



<p>Gratitude, research shows, is the language of happiness. At the sunset of his life, then, Sacks had arrived at the junction of those three paths.</p>



<p>He nailed the ending, Burns says. “That’s given to very, very few of us.”</p>

<h2>Environmental Sustainability of the “Right to Repair” Medical Equipment</h2>
<p>A medical <a href="https://www.repair.org/">Right-to-Repair</a> (RTR) movement can improve the sustainability and the environmental impact of the medical field.  Yet, the effective implementation of medical RTR remains challenging.  Healthcare systems are progressively relying on linear supply chains based on single-use disposable medical devices. This intrinsically unsustainable paradigm of manufacturing and use of medical equipment contributes to rising healthcare costs and worldwide ecological destruction. The effects imperil public health by contaminating the air, soil, and water, depleting resources, and causing catastrophic climate change. In this respect, sustainable development is making an urgent call to change the way in which the healthcare system satisfies its needs. Medical RTR would enable medical equipment to circulate through technical cycles of reuse, repair, re-purposing and recycling. Hence, medical RTR would make possible the transition of the healthcare system to a more circular economy furthering the goal of providing increasingly complex care in an environment-friendly future. The circular economy is an essential part of the sustainability agenda and has the potential to contribute to several Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Thus, effective implementation of medical RTR has powerful effects on achieving affordable and sustainable standards for the healthcare system.</p>
<p><strong>“Right To Repair” For A Circular Healthcare Economy:</strong></p>
<figure id="attachment_12515" aria-labelledby="figcaption_attachment_12515" class="wp-caption alignright" style="width: 310px"><img class="size-medium wp-image-12515" src="https://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2021/08/circular-economy-300x248.png" alt="" width="300" height="248" srcset="https://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2021/08/circular-economy-300x248.png 300w, https://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2021/08/circular-economy-1024x846.png 1024w, https://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2021/08/circular-economy-768x634.png 768w, https://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2021/08/circular-economy-110x90.png 110w, https://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2021/08/circular-economy-640x529.png 640w, https://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2021/08/circular-economy.png 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /><figcaption id="figcaption_attachment_12515" class="wp-caption-text"><div class="attachment-image--caption">The concept of “circular economy” incorporates the reuse, recycling, and repair of materials and products rather than single-use, via more circular production and consumption patterns.</div><div class="attachment-image--source"></div></figcaption></figure>
<p>During the Covid-19 pandemic, medical device companies responded by providing technical information and resources to biomedical technicians to meet the needs of front-line healthcare providers.  In the United States (U.S.) last year, Oregon Senator Ron Wyden introduced the RTR act calling manufacturers to provide the technical knowledge and tools necessary for hospitals to repair medical equipment.</p>
<p>Since then, there has been significant progress in the medical RTR movement. On July 9, 2021, U.S. President Biden signed a sweeping executive order urging the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) to establish RTR regulations and to issue rules preventing manufacturers from imposing restrictions on their product’s repair.</p>
<p>In this respect, medical RTR yields the implementation of a <a href="https://www.ellenmacarthurfoundation.org/circular-economy/concept">circular economy model</a> of healthcare that ensures that medical equipment is maintained at the highest value application for a longer lifespan. It provides a way to maximize equipment’s productivity, minimize waste and achieve sustainable standards. The medical RTR can allow medical equipment to flow through technological cycles of repair, reprocessing and reuse. As a consequence, RTR legislation is expected to allow the healthcare sector in the US to become more sustainable, environment-friendly and affordable.</p>
<p><strong>Significance of the “Right To Repair” in The Medical Field:</strong></p>
<p>In the wake of Covid-19 pandemic, supply chain systems proved to be vulnerable to disruptions from manufacturing shortages, interrupted transportation systems and price increases. In addition to Covid-19, climate change remains the most important threat to the global ecosystem, including the healthcare system. Therefore, it is critical we act with appropriate concern.</p>
<p>In 2003, large hospitals in the US made up less than 1% of all commercial buildings but used up to 4.3% of all commercial energy consumed in the US. In terms of global warming, US hospitals produced the equivalent of about 215 million metric tons of carbon dioxide in 2007 (Commercial Building Energy Consumption Survey-CBECS).</p>
<p>Medical RTR appears to be a critical strategy to develop an environment-friendly healthcare sector in addition to fulfilling shortages in medical equipment. Reprocessing and repairs are found to be effective in eliminating waste and improving environmental sustainability. In fact, reprocessing companies in the United-States, Canada and Europe reduced hospital solid waste generation by almost 7,100 tons in 2018 (MacNeill et al., 2020).</p>
<p><strong>Challenges to Medical Right to Repair:</strong></p>
<p>Despite the importance of repairability for environmental sustainability, there are challenges to medical equipment’s repair. Safety, security and adaptability are the main challenging considerations to take into account when advancing RTR laws.</p>
<p>First, patient’s safety is a main priority when considering the implementation of medical RTR. Regulations and standards are crucial to ensure quality repairs allowing medical devices to function as planned. In contrast, inaccurate repairs may result in serious and life-threatening implications.</p>
<p>Second, the security consideration needs to be taken into account throughout the repair process. To this end, the patient’s privacy needs to be protected and security against hacking and other cybercrimes needs to be maintained.</p>
<p>Third, medical RTR must be adaptable to continuous healthcare innovations and to the needs of the healthcare system. Medical RTR should respect IP (intellectual property) rights as a way to continue innovation in the medical technology space. Original manufacturers may observe flaws and inefficiencies and innovate in response to clinical demands and the regulation should not inhibit these evolving specifications. However, in contexts where urgent repairs can be life-saving, such as the Covid-19 pandemic, medical RTR can help reconcile the need to preserve innovation with the need for repairability and openness in the setting of patient care.</p>
<p><strong>Road Map to A Circular Healthcare Economy:</strong></p>
<p>To make the medical RTR effective, wrong practices of design for programmed obsolescence have to disappear in order to achieve effective long-lasting sustainable development.</p>
<p>An action plan needs to include clear incentives for manufacturers to provide the spare parts, tools and necessary technical knowledge to allow hospitals to repair their equipment. Also, products should be designed to last in time and be able to be repaired multiple times before they have to be recycled. Thus, design for durability is a key feature of the circular economy.</p>
<p>In addition, rules and regulations related to medical RTR need to ensure that medical equipment is subject to high quality repairs and safety regulations. To this end, a collaboration between manufacturers and hospitals is necessary to ensure that biomedical technicians follow the same standards that manufacturers have adopted.</p>
<p><strong>To Sum Up:</strong></p>
<p>A circular healthcare economy based on medical RTR increases efficiency and offers an alternative to the unsustainable environmental consequences of current practices. An active role of the healthcare system in the ecological transition is most likely to involve a high level of concerted actions among different people and institutions.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/radio-astronomy-history-cosmos-black-hole-planet-universe">How radio astronomy put new eyes on the cosmos</a></h4>

              
                <p class="has-drop-cap" style="font-size:20px">One can only imagine what Grote Reber’s neighbors thought when, in 1937, the amateur radio enthusiast erected in his yard a nearly 10-meter-wide shallow bowl of sheet metal, perched atop an adjustable scaffold and topped by an open pyramid of gangly towers. Little could his neighbors have known that they were witnessing the birth of a new way of looking at the cosmos.</p>



<p>Reber was building the world’s first dedicated radio telescope. Unlike traditional telescopes, which use lenses or mirrors to focus visible light, this contraption used metal and circuitry to collect interstellar radio waves, low frequency ripples of electromagnetic radiation. With his homemade device, Reber made the first map of the sky as seen with radio-sensitive eyes and <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/milky-way-earth">kicked off the field of radio astronomy</a>.</p>

<p>“Radio astronomy is as fundamental to our understanding of the universe as … optical astronomy,” says Karen O’Neil, site director at Green Bank Observatory in West Virginia. “If we want to understand the universe, we really need to make sure we have as many different types of eyes on the universe as we possibly can.”</p>



<p>When astronomers talk about radio waves from space, they aren’t (necessarily) referring to alien broadcasts. More often, they are interested in low-energy light that can emerge when molecules change up their rotation, for example, or when electrons twirl within a magnetic field. Tuning in to interstellar radio waves for the first time was akin to Galileo pointing a modified spyglass at the stars centuries earlier — we could see things in the sky <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/timeline-seeing-better">we’d never seen before</a>.</p>



<p>Today, radio astronomy is a global enterprise. More than 100 radio telescopes — from spidery antennas hunkered low to the ground to supersized versions of Reber’s dish that span hundreds of meters — dot the globe. These eyes on the sky have been so game-changing that they’ve been at the center of no fewer than three Nobel Prizes.</p>



<p>Not bad for a field that got started by accident.</p>



<p>In the early 1930s, an engineer at Bell Telephone Laboratories named Karl Jansky was tracking down sources of radio waves that interfered with wireless communication. He <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/outer-space-radio-hiss">stumbled upon a hiss</a> coming from somewhere in the constellation Sagittarius, in the direction of the center of the galaxy.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" width="680" height="447" src="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/100-worlds_spotlight-radio_inline_jansky.jpg" alt="black and white image of Karl Jansky working on his rotating radio antenna" class="wp-image-3102925" srcset="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/100-worlds_spotlight-radio_inline_jansky.jpg 680w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/100-worlds_spotlight-radio_inline_jansky-583x383.jpg 583w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/100-worlds_spotlight-radio_inline_jansky-283x186.jpg 283w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><figcaption><span class="caption wp-caption-3102925">Karl Jansky, shown here with his rotating radio antenna, stumbled on a radio hiss coming from the direction of the center of the galaxy, marking the beginnings of radio astronomy.</span><span class="credit wp-credit-3102925">NRAO, AUI, NSF, Jeff Hellerman</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>“The basic discovery that there was radio radiation coming from interstellar space confounded theory,” says astronomer Jay Lockman, also of Green Bank. “There was no known way of getting that.”</p>



<p>Bell Labs moved Jansky on to other, more Earthly pursuits. But Reber, a fan of all things radio, read about Jansky’s discovery and wanted to know more. No one had ever built a radio telescope before, so Reber figured it out himself, basing his design on principles used to focus visible light in optical scopes. He improved upon Jansky’s antenna — a bunch of metal tubes held up by a pivoting wooden trestle — and fashioned a parabolic metal dish for focusing incoming radio waves to a point, where an amplifier boosted the feeble signal. The whole contraption sat atop a tilting wooden base that let him scan the sky by swinging the telescope up and down. The same basic design is used today for radio telescopes around the world.</p>



<p>For nearly a decade — thanks partly to the Great Depression and World War II — Reber was largely alone. The field didn’t flourish until after the war, with a crop of scientists brimming with new radio expertise from designing radar systems. Surprises have been coming ever since.</p>

<p>“The discovery of interstellar molecules, that’s a big one,” says Lisa Young, an astronomer at New Mexico Tech in Socorro. Radio telescopes are well suited to peering into <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/final-chemistry-frontier">the dense, cold clouds where molecules reside</a> and sensing radiation emitted when they lose rotational energy. Today, the list of identified interstellar molecules includes many complex organics, including some <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/interstellar-chemical-resembles-building-blocks-life">thought to be precursors for life</a>.</p>



<p>Radio telescopes also turned up objects previously unimagined. Quasars, the blazing cores of remote galaxies powered by behemoth black holes, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/quasars-are-crazy">first showed up</a> in detailed radio maps from the late 1950s. Pulsars, the ultradense spinning cores of dead stars, made themselves known in 1967 when Jocelyn Bell Burnell noticed that the radio antenna array she helped build was picking up a steady beep … beep … beep from deep space every 1.3 seconds. (She was passed over when the 1974 Nobel Prize in physics honored this discovery — her adviser got the recognition. But an accolade came in 2018, when <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/jocelyn-bell-burnell-physics-prize-pulsar-discovery-interview">she was awarded a Special Breakthrough Prize in Fundamental Physics</a>.)</p>



<p>Pulsars are “not only interesting for being a discovery in themselves,” Lockman says. They “are being used now to make tests of general relativity and detect gravitational waves.” That’s because anything that nudges a pulsar — say, a passing ripple in spacetime — alters when its ultraprecise radio beats arrive at Earth. In the early 1990s, such timing variations from one pulsar led to <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/radio-pulses-hint-unseen-planets">the first confirmed discovery of planets outside the solar system</a>.</p>



<p>More recently, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/searching-distant-signals">brief blasts of radio energy primarily from other galaxies</a> have captured astronomers’ attention. Discovered in 2007, the causes of these “fast radio bursts” are still unknown. But they are already useful probes of the stuff between galaxies. The light from these eruptions encodes signatures of the atoms encountered while en route to Earth, allowing astronomers to track down <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/universe-missing-matter-found-fast-radio-bursts">lots of matter they thought should be out in the cosmos</a> but hadn’t found yet. “That was the thing that allowed us to weigh the universe and understand where the missing matter is,” says Dan Werthimer, an astronomer at the University of California, Berkeley.</p>





<p>And it was a radio antenna that, in 1964, gave <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/remnants-primeval-fireball-believed-aglow">the biggest boost to the then-fledgling Big Bang theory</a>. Arno Penzias and Robert Wilson, engineers at Bell Labs, were stymied by a persistent hiss in the house-sized, horn-like antenna they were repurposing for radio astronomy. The culprit was radiation that permeates all of space, left behind from a time when the universe was much hotter and denser than it is today. This “cosmic microwave background,” named for the relatively high frequencies at which it is strongest, is still the clearest window that astronomers have into the very early universe.</p>



<p>Radio telescopes have another superpower. Multiple radio dishes linked together across continents can act as one enormous observatory, with the ability to see details much finer than any of those dishes acting alone. Building a radio eye as wide as the planet — the Event Horizon Telescope — led to <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/black-hole-first-picture-event-horizon-telescope">the first picture of a black hole</a>.</p>

<p>“Not that anybody needed proof of the existence [of black holes],” Young says, “but there’s something so marvelous about actually being able to see it.”</p>

<p>And, of course, there’s <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/seti-anniversary-new-search-methods-hunt-alien-intelligence">the search for extraterrestrial intelligence</a>, or SETI. “Radio is probably the most likely place where we will answer the question: ‘Are we alone?’” Werthimer says.</p>

<p>That sentiment goes back more than a century. In 1899, inventor Nikola Tesla picked up radio signals that he thought were coming from folks on another planet. And for 36 hours in August 1924, the United States ordered all radio transmitters silent for five minutes every hour to listen for transmissions from Mars as Earth lapped the Red Planet at a relatively close distance. The field got a more official kickoff in 1960 when astronomer Frank Drake pointed Green Bank’s original radio telescope at the stars Tau Ceti and Epsilon Eridani, just in case anyone there was broadcasting.</p>



<p>While SETI has had its ups and downs, “there’s kind of a renaissance,” Werthimer says. “There’s a lot of new, young people going into SETI … and there’s new money.” In 2015, entrepreneur Yuri Milner <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/search-et-gets-financial-boost">pledged $100 million over 10 years</a> to the search for other residents of our universe.</p>



<p>Though the <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/arecibo-telescope-collapse-loss-big-deal-astronomy-video">collapse of the giant Arecibo Observatory in 2020</a> — at 305 meters across, it was the largest single dish radio telescope for most of its lifetime — was tragic and unexpected, radio astronomers have new facilities in the works. <a href="https://www.skatelescope.org/">The Square Kilometer Array</a>, which will link up small radio dishes and antennas across Australia and South Africa when complete in the late 2020s, will probe the acceleration of the universe’s expansion, seek out signs of life and explore conditions from cosmic dawn. “We’ll see the signatures of the first structures in the universe forming the first galaxies and stars,” Werthimer says.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" width="680" height="399" src="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/100-worlds_spotlight-radio_inline_ska.jpg" alt="rows of radio telescopes at the Square Kilometer Array" class="wp-image-3102927" srcset="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/100-worlds_spotlight-radio_inline_ska.jpg 680w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/100-worlds_spotlight-radio_inline_ska-653x383.jpg 653w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/100-worlds_spotlight-radio_inline_ska-317x186.jpg 317w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><figcaption><span class="caption wp-caption-3102927">The Square Kilometer Array will connect radio dishes and antennas across South Africa and Australia, offering an unprecedented look at the universe.</span><span class="credit wp-credit-3102927">SKA Observatory</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>But if the history of radio astronomy is any guide, the most remarkable discoveries yet to come will be the things no one has thought to look for. So much about the field is marked by serendipity, Werthimer notes. Even radio astronomy as a field started serendipitously. “If you just build something to look at some place that nobody’s looked before,” he says, “you&#8217;ll make interesting discoveries.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/streetlights-especially-super-bright-leds-may-harm-insect-populations">Streetlights, especially super bright LEDs, may harm insect populations</a></h4>

              
                <p>Moths flock to streetlights, bewitched by their luminous brilliance. But bathing in brightness all night seems to have consequences for the grounded forms of these fliers. Illuminated stretches of English roads housed up to <a href="https://advances.sciencemag.org/content/7/35/eabi8322/tab-article-info">52 percent fewer moth caterpillars</a> than adjacent dark patches, researchers report August 25 in <em>Science Advances</em>. Streetlights could be contributing to declining insect populations in developed areas, the researchers say.</p>



<p>Artificial light is generally not good for nocturnal insects. Recent work hints the glow can <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/nighttime-light-pollution-sabotages-sex-pheromones-moths">mess with mating</a> or <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/light-pollution-can-foil-plant-insect-hookups-and-not-just-night">disrupt pollination</a> (<em>SN: 5/13/15; SN: 8/2/17</em>). But whether night lights contribute to population decline is understudied, says Douglas Boyes, an entomologist at the UK Centre for Ecology and Hydrology in Wallingford, England.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Boyes and colleagues compared 27 stretches of road that appeared identical except some parts were lit at night and others remained dark. Instead of looking at moth adults that can fly kilometers during their lives, the researchers counted caterpillars, which traverse just meters. At night, the team knocked dozens of species from roadside hedgerows or swept up larvae from grasses, catching nearly 2,500 caterpillars.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Hedgerows under bright LED lights contained 52 percent fewer caterpillars than dark sections, while areas under duller sodium lamps housed 41 percent fewer. On grassy sections, LED lights cut the population by 33 percent, while sodium lamps had little effect. LED lamps emit a broader spectrum of light than other lamps, which may explain their heightened influence. Caterpillars were fatter in lit sections, which probably indicates abnormal development, Boyes says, but how exactly LED light harms caterpillars remains unclear.</p>



<p>The United Kingdom’s moth population has shrunk by a third in 50 years, but since less than 3 percent of the country lies under strong illumination from streetlights, habitat loss and climate change are more likely to blame than the lights, Boyes says. Still, the work highlights a relatively easy way to give some insects a break, he says. Just turn down the lights, or place filters on LEDs that narrow the spectra of light they shine down.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/covid-coronavirus-vaccines-hospital-cases-rates-unvaccinated">These charts show that COVID-19 vaccines are doing their job</a></h4>

              
                <p>As the coronavirus continues to surge across the United States, hospitals are again filling up with ill COVID-19 patients. And the vast majority of those patients are unvaccinated, as two new charts help make exceedingly clear.</p>



<p>One of those charts shows that from January 24 to July 24, vaccinated individuals were hospitalized with COVID-19 at a <a href="https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.08.27.21262356v1.full.pdf">much lower cumulative rate than unvaccinated individuals</a>. And the difference in rates between the two groups has only grown over time. By late July, a total of about 26 adults per 100,000 vaccinated people had been hospitalized for COVID-19. That’s compared with about 431 hospitalized people for every 100,000 unvaccinated individuals — a rate roughly 17 times as high as for those who were vaccinated. The data&nbsp;come from 13 states, including California, Georgia and Utah.</p>



<div class="wp-block-sciencenews-content-sidebar">
<h3>Growing divide<em>  </em></h3>



<p>The gap in the cumulative hospitalization rates among unvaccinated and fully vaccinated adults 18 years and older has been growing since COVID-19 vaccines started rolling out in late 2020. The data were adjusted for age and come from California, Colorado, Connecticut, Georgia, Maryland, Michigan, Minnesota, New Mexico, New York, Ohio, Oregon, Tennessee and Utah. </p>

<p>That trend held when the researchers charted hospitalization rates on a weekly basis too. From January to July, weekly hospitalization rates among unvaccinated people were six to 31 times as high as those in vaccinated people, the researchers report August 29 at medRxiv.org.</p>



<p>The accumulation of hospitalizations in each group over time, which that first chart shows, illustrates the risk of developing severe COVID-19 overall. And its message is clear: If you’re vaccinated during this pandemic, your risk of hospitalization is much, much lower than if you’re not vaccinated. The weekly rate, on the other hand, is a bit like the speedometer on a car — providing a glimpse of what&#8217;s happening week by week as the coronavirus spreads. Its message is also clear: The risk of a vaccinated person becoming hospitalized remains low at any given time, while the risk for unvaccinated people can fluctuate, probably as a result of community transmission.</p>



<div class="wp-block-sciencenews-content-sidebar">
<h3>Weekly trends </h3>



<p>Since January, weekly COVID-19 hospitalization rates have fluctuated in unvaccinated people but have been consistently higher than in vaccinated people. For instance, as the delta variant became the dominant variant in June, hospitalizations of unvaccinated adults 18 years and older spiked while rates for vaccinated remained steady and low. The data were adjusted for age and come from California, Colorado, Connecticut, Georgia, Maryland, Michigan, Minnesota, New Mexico, New York, Ohio, Oregon, Tennessee and Utah. </p>

<p>The findings, along with other recent research out of Los Angeles County, “remind us that if you are not yet vaccinated, you are among those highest at risk,” Rochelle Walensky, director of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, said August 24 in a White House news briefing. “Please do not underestimate the risk of serious consequences of this virus.”</p>



<p>As of August 26, more than <a href="https://protect-public.hhs.gov/pages/hospital-utilization">100,000 people are hospitalized for COVID-19</a> in the United States, according to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services — a level not seen since January amid the winter surge. &nbsp;</p>



<p>A separate study, described August 24 in <em>Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report, </em>that focused on Los Angeles County also showed that while COVID-19 vaccines don’t always stop infections, the shots still prevent people from landing in the hospital. That’s even with the spread of the highly contagious delta variant, which has raised concerns among public health officials because some <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/delta-variant-studies-cdc-coronavirus-covid-pandemic">vaccinated people who get infected can transmit the coronavirus</a> to others (<em>SN: 7/30/21</em>).&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>

<p>On July 25, when the delta variant was prevalent in the county, unvaccinated people were nearly <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/70/wr/mm7034e5.htm?s_cid=mm7034e5_w">30 times as likely to be hospitalized</a> as vaccinated people, the researchers found. Only one vaccinated person for every 100,000 people was hospitalized for COVID-19. Among unvaccinated people, there were around 29 hospitalizations per 100,000 individuals. In that same study, unvaccinated people were five times as likely to be infected as vaccinated people. &nbsp;</p>



<p>While the vaccines don’t protect against infection as well as they do against severe disease, the shots are keeping people off ventilators and from dying, Kathryn Edwards, an infectious disease pediatrician at Vanderbilt University School of Medicine in Nashville, said August 26 in a news briefing sponsored by the Infectious Diseases Society of America. “We cannot lose the forest for the trees.”</p>

<p><a href="https://bookshop.org/a/21798/9780197555767">On the Fringe</a><br><em>Michael D. Gordin</em><br><em>Oxford Univ., $18.95</em></p>



<p>There is no such thing as pseudoscience, and Michael Gordin has written a book about it.</p>



<p>In <em>On the Fringe</em>, Gordin, a historian at Princeton University, does not deny that there are endeavors afoot in the world that are labeled pseudoscience. Rather he shows that the term has no precise meaning, and that there is no unambiguous, universal test for delineating true science from the false versions on its fringe.</p>





<p>Many well-known examples of pseudoscience, he notes, were once mainstream scientific disciplines. Astrology, for instance, was for centuries respected or practiced by the most prominent scientific thinkers of their time.</p>



<p>Astrology’s time is long past, of course. So Gordin refers to it, and alchemy, and eugenics, as vestigial sciences — once regarded as totally scientific, but cast aside into the pseudoscience realm by the advance of knowledge.</p>



<p>Other pseudosciences arise having never attained respectable scientific status. Some are ideologically driven “hyperpoliticized” sciences; some, like creationism, are “counterestablishment” ventures that feign scientific trappings; others are wishful thinking delusions like extrasensory perception.</p>





<p>Advocates for many such pseudosciences seek legitimacy by imitating the scientific process — holding conferences, publishing journals and claiming to cite evidence (though presented in ways riddled with logical fallacies).</p>



<p>The problem is, “real” science also <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/odds-are-its-wrong">sometimes suffers from errors of rigor and logic</a>, as recent concerns about reproducing experimental results have demonstrated (<em>SN: 3/27/10, p. 26</em>). So drawing a sharp line between real and pseudo remains a difficult task.</p>



<p>Gordin provides neat, quick summaries of all these issues in his brief but thoughtful and enjoyable book. Most valuable of all is his first chapter, in which he demolishes the notion that philosopher Karl Popper’s “falsifiability” criterion allows a clear demarcation between science and non- (or pseudo-) science. <em>Falsifiable</em>, Gordin points out, is undefinable. If nothing else, every working scientist (and science journalist) should read this chapter to learn that the refrain “if it’s not falsifiable, it’s not science” is philosophically unsound gibberish, a sign of a weak argument.</p>



<p>Still, some pseudoscience is clearly out of bounds. And some would say the scientific revolution of the 17th century established new rules that filtered bad science from the good. But it still took a while for modern science to do away with astrology and alchemy. Later, eugenics and even ESP were for a time taken seriously by some “modern” scientists. Sometimes it just takes time to identify bad science and discard it.</p>



<p>As Gordin writes, science is not a “fixed repository of information,” but a dynamic enterprise focused to a large extent on “refuting or revising past knowledge.” So in a sense the scientific revolution did not really render the science of the ancient Greeks or Middle Ages pseudoscience, but rather just revealed it to be primitive science, awaiting better methods, technologies and insights. As science historian Steven Shapin opened his 1996 book on that topic, “There was no such thing as the Scientific Revolution, and this is a book about it.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/planet-habitable-new-type-hycean-search-extraterrestrial-life-aliens">New ideas on what makes a planet habitable could reshape the search for life</a></h4>

              
                <p>When considering where to look for extraterrestrial life, astronomers have mostly stuck with what’s familiar. The best candidates for habitable planets are considered the ones most like Earth: small, rocky, with breathable atmospheres and a clement amount of warmth from their stars.</p>



<p>But as more planets outside the solar system have been discovered, astronomers have <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/why-just-being-habitable-zone-doesnt-make-exoplanets-livable">debated the usefulness of this definition</a> (<em>SN: 10/4/19</em>). Some planets in the so-called habitable zone, where temperatures are right for liquid water, are probably not good for life at all. Others outside that designated area might be perfectly comfortable.</p>



<p>Now, two studies propose revising the concept of “habitable zone” to account for more of the planets that astronomers may encounter in the cosmos. One new definition brings more planets into the habitable fold; the other nudges some out.</p>



<p>“Both papers focus on questioning the classical idea of the habitable zone,” says astronomer Noah Tuchow of Penn State University. “We should extend the range of places that we look, so we don’t miss habitable planets.”</p>





<p>Some overlooked planets could be much bigger than Earth, and potentially receive no starlight at all. Astrophysicist Nikku Madhusudhan of the University of Cambridge and colleagues propose a <a href="https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/abfd9c">new category of possibly habitable planet</a> that could be found at almost any distance from any kind of star.</p>



<p>These hypothetical planets have a global liquid-water ocean nestled under a thick <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/planets-hydrogen-rich-atmosphere-alien-life">hydrogen-rich atmosphere</a> (<em>SN: 5/4/20</em>). Madhusudhan calls them “Hycean” planets, for “hydrogen” and “ocean.” They could be up to 2.6 times the size of Earth and up to 10 times as massive, Madhusudhan and colleagues report August 25 in the<em> Astrophysical Journal. </em>That thick atmosphere could keep temperatures right for liquid water even with minimal input from a star, while the ocean could protect anything living from crushing atmospheric pressure.</p>



<p>“We want to expand beyond our fixated paradigm so far on Earthlike planets,” Madhusudhan says. “Everything we’ve learned about exoplanets so far is extremely diverse. Why restrict ourselves when it comes to life?”</p>



<p>In the search for alien life, Hycean planets would have several advantages over rocky planets in the habitable zone, the team says. Though it’s difficult to tell which worlds definitely have oceans and hydrogen atmospheres, there are many more known exoplanets in the mass and temperature ranges of Hycean planets than there are Earthlike planets. So the odds are good, Madhusudhan says.</p>



<p>And because they are generally larger and have more extended atmospheres than rocky planets, Hycean planets are easier to probe for biosignatures, molecular signs of life. Detectable biosignatures on Hycean planets could include rare molecules associated with life on Earth like dimethyl sulfide and carbonyl sulfide. These tend to be too low in concentration to detect in thin Earthlike atmospheres, but thicker Hycean atmospheres would show them more readily.</p>



<p>Best of all, existing or planned telescopes could detect those molecules within a few years, if they’re there. Madhusudhan already has plans to use NASA’s James Webb Space Telescope, due to launch later this year, to observe the <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/first-known-exoplanet-rain-clouds-water-droplets">water-rich planet K2 18b</a> (<em>SN: 9/11/19</em>).</p>



<p>That planet’s habitability was debated when it was reported in 2019. Madhusudhan says 20 hours of observations with JWST should solve the debate.</p>



<p>“Best-case scenario, we’ll detect life on K2 18b,” he says, though “I’m not holding my breath over it.”</p>



<p>Astronomer Laura Kreidberg of the Max Planck Institute for Astronomy in Heidelberg, Germany, thinks it probably won’t be that easy. Planets in the Hycean size range tend to have cloudy or hazy atmospheres, making biosignatures more difficult to pick up.</p>



<p>It’s also not clear if Hycean planets actually exist in nature. “It is a really fun idea,” she says. “But is it just a fun idea, or does it match up with reality? I think we absolutely don’t know yet.”</p>



<p>Rather than inventing a new way to bring exoplanets into the habitable family, Tuchow and fellow Penn State astronomer Jason Wright are kicking some apparently habitable planets out. The pair realized that the region of clement temperatures around a star changes as the star evolves and changes brightness.</p>



<p>Some planets are born in the habitable zone and stay there their entire lives. But some, possibly most, are born outside their star’s habitable zone and enter it later, as the star ages. In the August <em>Research Notes of the American Astronomical Society</em>, Tuchow and Wright suggest calling those worlds “<a href="https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/2515-5172/ac1ea2">belatedly habitable planets</a>.”</p>



<p>When astronomers point their telescopes at a given star, the scientists are seeing only a snapshot of the star’s habitable zone, the pair say. “If you just look at a planet in the habitable zone in the present day, you have no idea how long it’s been there,” Tuchow says. It’s an open question whether planets that enter the habitable zone later in life can ever become habitable, he explains. If the planet started out too close to the star, it could have lost all its water to a greenhouse effect, like Venus did. Moving Venus to the position of Earth won’t give it its water back.</p>



<p>On the other end, a planet that was born farther from its star could be entirely covered in glaciers, which reflect sunlight. They may never melt, even when their stars brighten. Worse, their water could go straight from frozen to evaporated, a process known as sublimation. That scenario would leave the planet no time with even a cozy wet puddle for life to get started in.</p>



<p>These planets are “still in the habitable zone,” Tuchow says. “But it adds questions about whether or not being in the habitable zone actually means habitable.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/664405518/0/oupblogpsychology/">Why were Finnish schools so successful with distance and in-person learning during the pandemic?</a></h4>

              
                <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://blog.oup.com/2021/08/why-were-finnish-schools-so-successful-with-distance-and-in-person-learning-during-the-pandemic/"><img width="480" height="185" src="https://blog.oup.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/pexels-julia-m-cameron-4145243-1-480x185.jpg" loading="lazy" link_thumbnail="1" /></a><p>On 18 March 2020, schools in Finland closed. On 14 May 2020, they reopened successfully. Why was Finland successful in transitioning to distance education and then back to face-to-face learning and teaching?</p><p>There is an a priori answer. Finns have a view of education and learning that often contradicts common wisdom (such as worrying less about the standardized performance of children and teachers&#8217; accountability) to truly serve the wellbeing of children by empowering the highly selective and trained teacher force with trust.</p><p>Finns are passionate about face-to-face education even in the age of technology-driven educational services. They have invested heavily in new or refurbished twenty-first century superschools, which create superb and highly resourced teaching and learning environments that facilitate the face-to-face and digital interactions between teachers and students. Together with a serendipitous policy mix of national, local, and school decisions, the school is no longer only a place to teach and learn subjects but also a phenomenon where the whole learning experience and children&#8217;s growth occur. They put a lot of effort into making sure that the children feel safe under a relaxed culture of interaction between students and teachers.</p><p>The Finns have invested in two structural foundations to facilitate the pedagogic interaction: a powerful teaching force and a technological infrastructure (sound broadband internet access and educational tools so that teachers can navigate different pedagogic proposals and environments). They have reduced the number of smaller, less well-resourced schools, and instead, they have established large superschools to house more resources for many students. Fewer, well-resourced schools, rather than many low-resourced schools, is one of their key ideas.</p><p>Digitalization in schools followed digitalization in life—but schools went one step further. More screen time is not learning. Therefore, Finnish schools decided to provide digital access for everyone and train teachers and students with skills on how to use this technology for learning and wellbeing. They don&#8217;t force digitalization but make sure that if teachers and students want to explore digital means, all the schools are ready for them.</p><p>Since collaboration among all school agents (teachers, students, and parents) has always been essential in the Finnish model of education, and since the society and parents have a high value of education (for example, the teaching profession is one of the most highly demanded fields of university studies by high school students), it was not very difficult for schools and teachers to communicate with parents and students during the pandemic.</p><p>The pandemic accelerated the turn-of-the-century trends: more digitalization, flexible technology, teamwork, and a focus on the wellbeing of students and teachers. So, what should we expect in the future? In the short term, new spaces for outdoor activities, more digital skills, more constant formative evaluations for students, and more strategic planning for future crises in the long term.</p><p>Here are the key learnings shared by Finnish teachers, experts, and principals during the pandemic:</p><ul><li>The need to keep the information and communication channels open and frequent among all people.</li><li>The need to bring the newly acquired skills into daily lives, perhaps with remote sessions once a week or per school term, as modern technology companies do.</li><li>The knowledge that we are living, in part, the normality of the future.</li><li>The pandemic is a phenomenon with solid consequences: loneliness kills.</li><li>A school is a place to learn academic skills and, perhaps more importantly, grow and share with others. A school is a place where one can safely fail and recover.</li><li>Teachers took a tremendous digital leap.</li><li>The majority opinion seems to be that closing schools hurt students.</li><li>Face-to-face teaching and learning is the correct form of education and deep learning.</li><li>Although the pandemic has driven the digital leap at all educational levels, the coronavirus will not change school curricula. The issue is how to approach rather than change the school curricula.</li><li>Education has been, and continues to be, the number one priority in Finland.</li><li>When everyone (students, parents, teachers, community) works together, we can get the best results.</li><li>Lifelong learning is not just a phrase; it is a necessity for every one of us.</li></ul><p>Face-to-face education is so important to achieve. Digitalization is an instrument, a means to an end. Digital technology complements the work of teachers. The dual vision of digital preparedness and children&#8217;s wellbeing, backed by the already-in-place teachers&#8217; pedagogic command, facilitated the successful transition back and forth between distance and face-to-face learning during the 2020-2021 coronavirus crisis.</p><Img align="left" border="0" height="1" width="1" style="border:0;float:left;margin:0;padding:0;width:1px!important;height:1px!important;" hspace="0" src="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/i/664405518/0/oupblogpsychology"><div style="clear:both;padding-top:0.2em;"><a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/2/664405518/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/fbshare20.png" style="border:0;margin:0;padding:0;"></a>&#160;<a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/28/664405518/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/fblike20.png" style="border:0;margin:0;padding:0;"></a>&#160;<a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/16/664405518/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/linkedin20.png" style="border:0;margin:0;padding:0;"></a>&#160;<a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/29/664405518/oupblogpsychology,https%3a%2f%2fblog.oup.com%2fwp-content%2fuploads%2f2021%2f08%2fpexels-julia-m-cameron-4145243-1-480x185.jpg"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/pinterest20.png" style="border:0;margin:0;padding:0;"></a>&#160;<a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/1/664405518/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/reddit20.png" style="border:0;margin:0;padding:0;"></a>&#160;<a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/24/664405518/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/twitter20.png" style="border:0;margin:0;padding:0;"></a>&#160;<a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/19/664405518/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/email20.png" style="border:0;margin:0;padding:0;"></a>&#160;<a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/20/664405518/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/rss20.png" style="border:0;margin:0;padding:0;"></a><h3 style="clear:left;padding-top:10px">Related Stories</h3><ul><li><a rel="NOFOLLOW" href="https://blog.oup.com/2021/08/science-denial-why-it-happens-and-5-things-you-can-do-about-it/">Science denial: why it happens and 5 things you can do about&#xA0;it</a></li><li><a rel="NOFOLLOW" href="https://blog.oup.com/2021/08/what-does-the-history-of-victory-day-tell-us-about-russias-national-identity/">What does the history of Victory Day tell us about Russia&#8217;s national identity?</a></li><li><a rel="NOFOLLOW" href="https://blog.oup.com/2021/08/shape-and-societal-recovery-from-crises/">SHAPE and societal recovery from crises</a></li></ul>&#160;</div>

<p><strong>The shrinking mass of Pluto</strong> — <em><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/shrinking-mass-pluto">Science News</a></em>, August 28, 1971</p>



<p>Pluto was the last of the planets to be discovered (in 1930). If astronomers continue to make it lighter, it may be the first to disappear.… [The latest measurement] brings Pluto down to 0.11 of Earth’s mass, less than an eighth of its former self.… The wide discrepancies among the figures presented for the mass of Pluto illustrate the particular difficulties of measuring its mass.… If a planet has satellites, its mass can be determined from studying their motions.… But Pluto has no known satellites.</p>



<h4>Update</h4>



<p>The <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/moon-believed-found-pluto">discovery of Pluto’s moon Charon</a> in 1978 (<em>SN: 7/15/78, p. 36</em>) finally allowed astronomers to accurately calculate the planet’s mass: about 0.2 percent of Earth’s mass. Decades after scientists resolved Pluto’s heft, the planet received arguably the greatest demotion of all — <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/doggone-pluto-gets-planetary-demotion">a downgrade to dwarf planet</a> (<em>SN: 9/2/06, p. 149</em>). Some astronomers have since proposed alternate definitions for the term “planet” that, if widely adopted, would <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/pluto-planet-vote-status-definition-demotion">restore Pluto to its former rank</a>.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/great-barrier-reef-coral-muga-dhambi-resilience-size">An incredibly resilient coral in the Great Barrier Reef offers hope for the future</a></h4>

              
                <p>A coral the size of a carousel is the widest known in the Great Barrier Reef.</p>



<p>Found just off the coast of Goolboodi Island in Northeast Australia, this reef-building <em>Porites</em> measures 10.4 meters in diameter — earning it the nickname Muga dhambi, or “big coral,” from the Indigenous custodians of the island, the Manbarra people.</p>



<p>In addition to its record-setting width, Muga dhambi stands a little over 5 meters tall, making it the <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-021-94818-w">sixth tallest coral in the Great Barrier Reef</a>, researchers report August 19 in <em>Scientific Reports</em>.</p>



<p>“It’s a stand-alone coral … and we don&#8217;t see many that size,” says marine scientist Nathan Cook of Reef Ecologic, a climate and environmental consulting firm in Townsville, Australia.</p>



<p>Based on Muga dhambi’s height and estimated growth rate, Cook and colleagues calculate that the creamy brown, boulderlike coral is about 421 to 438 years old. It predates European colonization of Australia and has survived as many as 80 <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/climate-change-powerful-pacific-cyclones-may-fuel-global-warming">cyclones</a> (<em>SN: 5/28/20</em>) and 99 <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/great-barrier-reef-suffering-most-widespread-bleaching-ever-recorded">coral bleaching events</a> (<em>SN: 7/4/21</em>), the team says.</p>



<p>Many of the recent stories about corals in the Great Barrier Reef read like obituaries, Cook says. “Knowing that these things [like Muga dhambi] exist, and have persisted for a long time, helps to provide a renewed sense of hope for the future.”</p>

                <p class="">A brain aneurysm is a weakened area in the lining of a blood vessel in the brain where blood accumulates, causing a bulging of the blood vessel wall. Most brain aneurysms do not cause any symptoms, but a ruptured aneurysm can lead to bleeding into the area surrounding the brain—a dangerous condition known as subarachnoid hemorrhage. In this video, I discuss the characteristics, formation, rupture, and treatment of brain aneurysms.</p>

                <p><em>By</em> <a href="https://emmayoung.net/">Emma Young</a></p>



<p>We’re famously bad at spotting lies (<a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2012/05/14/skilled-liars-make-great-lie-detectors/">well, most of us are; skilled liars are better</a>). That doesn’t stop us thinking we know when someone’s spinning us a line, of course. Now a <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/0956797621994770">new paper</a> in <em>Psychological Science</em> reveals that we take an angry denial to be a sign that the accused is lying. And yet, Katherine A. DeCelles at the University of Toronto and colleagues also report, anger in response to a false accusation is in fact a sign of <em>innocence</em>.</p>



<span id="more-43365"></span>



<p>In initial studies on more than 4,000 online participants, the team established that anger is consistently taken as a sign of guilt. This held across a variety of contexts, including a fictional courtroom situation with an accusation of armed robbery, and also scenarios involving accusations of infidelity and theft. In each case, the participants read about how the confronted individuals reacted, and made judgments about their guilt. Fictional people who’d made angry denials were taken to be guiltier than those who’d made &#8220;irritated&#8221; denials (characterised by a raised voice and less vehement protests), and they were in turn taken to be guiltier than those who’d calmly professed their innocence.</p>



<p>Perhaps, though, professionals who often have to make guilt judgements in their jobs react differently? A fresh study on 136 such people, including fraud investigators, police and lawyers, found this not to be the case. These participants judged that an employee described as having reacted angrily to an accusation of theft was guiltier than one who reacted calmly. In fact, the &#8220;angry&#8221; employee was considered just as guilty as a &#8220;silent&#8221; employee who’d refused to respond when confronted.</p>



<p>If anger actually is a sign of guilt then these results would suggest a useful clue to truthfulness, of course. However, in a subsequent study, participants who were asked to reflect on situations in their own lives reported feeling and also displaying more anger when they had been falsely vs justly accused of a misdeed. It didn’t matter whether the deed was trivial (taking a room-mate’s food, for example) or serious — cheating on a spouse, say, or workplace misconduct.</p>



<p>In a final study, participants took part in an in-person lab-based experiment in which some were falsely accused of making mistakes on a text-based task; this group reported feeling angrier than those who were correctly accused of making errors.</p>



<p>Overall, then, as the researchers write, anger does seem to be used as invalid cue of guilt while being a valid cue of innocence.</p>



<p>It’s important to understand what is — and isn’t — a genuine sign of innocence vs guilt in all kinds of situations, of course. But there are a few reasons to be cautious about drawing strong conclusions from this new work. For example: the &#8220;angry&#8221; denials that the participants read in the initial experiments were pretty angry, featuring explicit language and expressing outrage. Their anger level was a lot higher than that reported by participants in the latter studies in response to being falsely accused themselves. Even those who’d reflected on being falsely accused of a serious transgression did not report such extreme anger. <em>Hamlet</em> springs to mind, and Queen Gertrude’s classic line: “The lady doth protest too much…” An emotional over-reaction that doesn’t match the scale of an accusation might yet be a sign of guilt; at least, this paper doesn’t show that it isn’t.</p>



<p>However, it’s true that people who reacted with irritation were taken to be guiltier than those who responded calmly. So until more work is done in this area, it seems worth at least trying not to use someone’s anger level in response to an accusation as a sign of guilt.</p>

<p>We are happy to announce our <a href="https://blog.arxiv.org/2020/09/28/arxivlabs-a-space-for-community-innovation/">arXivLabs</a> collaboration with <a href="https://scite.ai/">scite</a>, a new company that is introducing &#8220;Smart Citations.&#8221; These new citations not only show how many times an article has been cited, but <i>how</i> it has been cited by other publications. This is done by showing the citation context from the citing article, the section of the paper the citation appears in, and whether the citing paper provides supporting or contrasting evidence to the cited claim. These Smart Citations have already been integrated by various publishers and preprint servers to help readers better contextualize and understand research findings.</p>
<p>With this collaboration, arXiv readers can now easily see how millions of preprints have been cited by opening the corresponding scite report. Once on the report, users can quickly read citation statements from each citing paper to see how an article and its findings have been discussed or used, find co-citations, filter by citation types (supporting, contrasting, and mentioning), and more.</p>
<p>To build the tool, scite has processed millions of full-text articles in order to extract and analyze citation statements. To date, scite has analyzed over 26M full-text articles and extracted and analyzed nearly 900M citation statements across a range of disciplines.</p>
<p>Josh Nicholson, co-founder and CEO of scite says, &#8220;We’re happy to be working in collaboration with arXiv to help readers better contextualize and understand research findings. arXiv hosts some of the world’s most important research and we are happy to contribute to making that researcher easier to interpret and evaluate.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We’re excited to be working with scite to help provide more context to how articles have been received in the literature,&#8221; said Eleonora Presani. Presani continued, &#8220;scite makes it easy to understand and quickly see how an article has been cited. By opening this information up so that it is easily accessible and digestible we think that will improve research itself.&#8221;</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/transgender-youth-mental-health-gender-affirming-care-laws">Gender-affirming care improves mental health for transgender youth</a></h4>

              
                <p class="has-drop-cap" style="font-size:20px">Daniel’s birth certificate is marked “female,” but Daniel is nonbinary — not exclusively male nor female. “I’m masculine leaning,” says the 18-year-old.</p>



<p>The disconnect between Daniel’s gender identity and physical appearance, which was apparent to them around age 4, became unbearable during puberty. “I hated showers because I didn’t like looking at my body,” Daniel says. “I just felt really uncomfortable with the idea of being female.” At 13, Daniel came out to their mother as transgender, someone whose gender identity does not match the sex they were assigned at birth.</p>



<p>About a month after coming out, Daniel started seeing a therapist who specialized in gender identity. A year later they were referred to an endocrinologist, who prescribed the sex hormone testosterone. For Daniel, the most important effect was a deeper voice. “My biggest problem with getting misgendered was that my voice was really high,” Daniel says.</p>



<p>Before starting hormone therapy, Daniel considered suicide. With masculinizing hormones, they say they’re happier with life. “I definitely feel more like myself. Like I was just existing before, but now I’m living, now that I’m open to everyone about who I am, and most importantly I’m open to myself,” says Daniel, whose last name is being withheld for medical privacy. “Starting testosterone, for me, saved my life.”</p>





<p>Daniel’s hormone therapy is just one method that doctors use to bring a person’s body into alignment with their gender identity, an approach known as gender-affirming health care. This kind of care looks different for people of different ages. For young children, it is limited to allowing them to socially express their gender, with perhaps a name and pronoun change. Adolescents may take medications to delay puberty, followed by gender-affirming hormones and possibly surgery. While researchers are still investigating potential risks, existing evidence suggests that these treatments could have life-saving mental health benefits.</p>



<p>Over the last 20 years or so, gender-affirming treatment has become the standard of care for transgender people in the United States. That change has followed increasing recognition in the medical community that being transgender is a normal example of human diversity and not a mental disorder. About <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/68/wr/mm6803a3.htm">1.8 percent of American high schoolers are transgender</a>, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.</p>



<p>Despite findings from the United States and Europe that show the positive mental health effects of gender-affirming care, a recent groundswell of state legislation has sought to curb access to gender-affirming health care for those who want it. In April, Arkansas became the first state to ban gender-affirming treatments for minors. Similar bills have been proposed in more than a dozen other states. Although several of those proposals failed — and a federal judge blocked the Arkansas law in July — they may still exact a mental health toll on many transgender youth, experts say.</p>



<p>“Even if the bills don’t pass, even if they die in committee, the damage is being done,” says Jason Klein, a pediatric endocrinologist at NYU Langone Health in New York City. “Many people across this country are already going to be hurt just by the ideas being put out by these bills.”</p>

<p>Proponents of health care restrictions for transgender youth say they want to protect children from life-altering procedures they may later regret, as well as medical risks, which may include impacts on fertility and bone health. But the <a href="https://services.aap.org/en/news-room/news-releases/aap/2021/american-academy-of-pediatrics-speaks-out-against-bills-harming-transgender-youth/">American Academy of Pediatrics</a> and the <a href="https://www.endocrine.org/news-and-advocacy/news-room/2021/endocrine-society-condemns-efforts-to-block-access-to-medical-care-for-transgender-youth">Endocrine Society</a> have endorsed gender-affirming care, arguing that the restrictions would endanger a population already at severe risk of depression and self-harm.</p>



<p>Transgender youth are three to four times as likely as their peers <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/blog/science-the-public/transgender-children-are-greater-risk-mental-health-problems">to have depression or anxiety</a> (<em>SN Online: 3/1/17</em>). Among 13,600 transgender and nonbinary youth who participated in a national survey in 2020, 52 percent had considered suicide in the previous year, and 21 percent had attempted it.</p>



<p>Gender-affirming health care could improve those alarming statistics across age groups, says Jack Turban, a child and adolescent psychiatry researcher at Stanford University School of Medicine. “All existing research suggests that gender-affirming medical interventions improve the mental health of transgender youth.”</p>



<h4>Transitioning in childhood</h4>



<p>For children who haven’t yet started puberty, gender-affirming health care involves no medical treatments. It entails parents and doctors supporting a child through a social transition. This may mean calling the child by a new name, using the pronouns that fit their gender identity and allowing the child to dress or wear their hair however feels most authentic to them.</p>



<p>Mental health care professionals can help families through this process. “Sometimes, the kids need more conversation and time to think about their gender identity and their goals for themselves,” Klein says. “Sometimes, the parents need that — the kids are very solid and steady and know exactly who they are, and the parents might need some time to kind of adjust.”</p>

<p>Being supported through a social transition appears to boost young people’s mental health. Levels of depression and self-worth reported by more than 100 socially transitioned transgender children from across the United States and Canada were <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0890856716319414#!">about the same as for their nontransgender, or cisgender, siblings and peers</a>, researchers reported in 2017 in the <em>Journal of the American Academy of Child &amp; Adolescent Psychiatry</em>. Transgender kids who have not socially transitioned, on the other hand, have historically shown high levels of depression.</p>



<p>Opponents of gender-affirming health care have cited studies suggesting that as many as 80 percent of people who identify as transgender in early childhood will not continue to do so when they grow up. But others have pointed out that those studies included many children who may have been considered transgender based on outdated and overly broad criteria, thus skewing the results. Researchers are still investigating how gender identity evolves with age.</p>



<p>“We have to be honest. We don’t know so much about it,” says Annelou de Vries, a child and adolescent psychiatrist at the Amsterdam University Medical Centers. Thus, nonpermanent gender-affirming treatment options may allow children time to safely explore their identity as they approach adolescence, proponents say.</p>



<h4>Pausing puberty</h4>



<p>At the start of puberty, children who are transgender or questioning their gender identity may begin taking medications that suppress the natural release of estrogen and testosterone, sex hormones that cause the body to change. Such puberty blockers can be taken through an injection once a month or every few months, or through a small implant inserted in the upper arm and replaced annually.</p>



<p>“These medications are fully reversible,” says Russell Toomey, a family studies and human development researcher at the University of Arizona in Tucson. When someone stops taking them, the body picks up where it left off and proceeds through puberty.</p>



<p>Delaying puberty allows transgender children to go through their early teenage years without experiencing potentially distressing body changes not aligned with their gender identity, Toomey says. For adolescents who later receive hormones, puberty blockers can limit the development of physical features such as breasts that would require surgery to change later.</p>



<p>Puberty blockers are among the gender-affirming treatments forbidden by the latest bills. But these medications are not new and are not just for transgender youth. They have been used for decades to treat children who start showing signs of puberty before age 8 or 9, a condition known as precocious puberty. For transgender youth, these time-tested medications can be a lifeline. Transgender adolescents who had access to puberty blockers <a href="https://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/145/2/e20191725?sso=1&amp;sso_redirect_count=3&amp;nfstatus=401&amp;nftoken=00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000&amp;nfstatusdescription=ERROR:%2520No%2520local%2520token&amp;nfstatus=401&amp;nftoken=00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000&amp;nfstatusdescription=ERROR:%2520No%2520local%2520token">were 70 percent less likely to consider suicide</a> than those who could not get the medications, according to a 2020 study in <em>Pediatrics</em>. Of the more than 20,000 U.S. transgender adults surveyed, nearly 17 percent had wanted puberty blockers while growing up, but just 2.5 percent of them received the medications.</p>



<p>Youth who visited a gender identity clinic but hadn’t started treatment had more emotional problems such as anxiety and depression, and suicidal tendencies than their cisgender peers, a study of 1,100 youth in the Netherlands found. In contrast, children receiving puberty blockers at that clinic <a href="https://www.jahonline.org/article/S1054-139X(20)30027-6/fulltext">showed similar or better psychological functioning</a> than cisgender kids, the researchers reported in 2020 in the <em>Journal of Adolescent Health</em>.</p>



<div class="wp-block-sciencenews-content-sidebar">
<h3>Closer to OK&nbsp;</h3>



<p>Emotional problems, such as depression or anxiety, that would qualify for mental health care were much more common among transgender teens who had not been treated with puberty blockers than among those who had received those medications, in a study of Dutch youth. Similarly, a higher percentage of transgender teens who had not received puberty blockers expressed suicidal thoughts than trans peers who had received the medications and than cisgender, or nontransgender, teens. </p>



<h6>Differences in mental health among Dutch adolescents</h6>

<p>Daniel wishes they’d had the opportunity to take the medications. “I really do believe if I’d been on [puberty] blockers, things would have been a lot easier for me,” Daniel says. “I would have still struggled, but it would have been easier to handle.”</p>



<p>One possible side effect of puberty blockers is delayed bone development. The medications interrupt the rapid buildup in bone density that generally occurs during puberty, potentially leading to weaker bones in adulthood. But long-term data from people treated for precocious puberty suggest that bone development catches up once people stop taking puberty blockers.</p>



<p>Likewise, early data on transgender youth indicate that hormone therapy helps bone growth catch up once teens stop taking puberty blockers, de Vries says. Long-term data don’t yet exist to comprehensively assess the impacts in transgender adults.</p>



<p>To be safe, Johanna Olson-Kennedy, who practices pediatrics and adolescent medicine at Children’s Hospital Los Angeles, gives special instructions to her patients starting puberty blockers. “We have them take vitamin D and calcium supplementation, and we stress the importance of weight-bearing exercise, which is critical for shoring up bone density.”</p>



<h4>Reversible and not</h4>



<p>Older transgender adolescents can start taking gender-affirming hormones, as Daniel did. A new law in Tennessee bans such hormones for prepubescent children. Yet current medical guidelines do not recommend hormone therapy earlier than about age 14 to 16.</p>



<p>Masculinizing hormone therapy involves taking testosterone to promote changes like voice deepening and facial hair growth, while suppressing menstruation and breast development. Daniel takes testosterone through injections, but the hormone can also be absorbed via skin ointment or a patch.</p>



<p>Feminizing hormone therapy involves taking estrogen through a pill, patch or injection, often with a separate drug to block the body’s natural testosterone. This causes breast development, slows body hair growth and decreases muscle mass. Some effects of hormone therapy, such as facial hair growth, voice deepening and breast development, are permanent, whereas changes in muscle mass and fat distribution are reversible if treatment stops.</p>



<div class="wp-block-sciencenews-content-sidebar">
<h3>Body changes&nbsp;</h3>



<p>Transgender teens about 14 to 16 years old may start taking the masculinizing hormone testosterone or the feminizing hormone estrogen to promote body changes that align with their gender identity.</p>

<p>Twenty-one out of 47 transgender youth in a study at a Missouri children’s hospital expressed suicidal tendencies before starting hormone therapy, <a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2019-52280-009">while six did after treatment</a>, researchers reported in 2019 in <em>Clinical Practice in Pediatric Psychology</em>. Another study at a Texas clinic found that 86 transgender teens on hormone therapy surveyed were <a href="https://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/145/4/e20193006">happier with their bodies</a> after about one year of treatment than they were before, researchers reported in 2020 in <em>Pediatrics</em>. On a body dissatisfaction scale from 0 (none) to 116 (highest dissatisfaction), teens’ self-reported ratings fell 20 points on average, from about 71 before treatment to about 51 afterward.</p>



<p>While studies like these and many others on the mental health effects of gender-affirming health care are small, taken together they suggest the treatments have a positive impact, even as research efforts continue, says Lauren Beach, a sexual and gender minority health researcher at Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine in Chicago. “When we consider the incredibly heightened risk that trans youth face for suicide in general, those studies are incredibly compelling.”</p>

<p>Hormone therapy is generally considered safe, but it’s not risk-free. Testosterone and estrogen can both affect fertility, but the effects vary from person to person. People who want to preserve their fertility can freeze eggs or bank sperm before starting gender-affirming hormones — although adolescents who have taken puberty blockers may be less likely than those who have gone through uninterrupted puberty to produce viable eggs or sperm.</p>



<p>“In my experience, most people do not pursue fertility preservation techniques — whether that’s because of their own wants or needs, or because of financial constraints, insurance constraints [or] time constraints,” Klein says. Recent research echoes that observation. At one clinic, of 72 transgender adolescents <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1054139X16309582">counseled on fertility preservation options</a>, just two used them, researchers reported in 2017 in the<em> Journal of Adolescent Health</em>.</p>



<p>Transgender individuals taking hormones may have a higher-than-before risk of common gender-associated diseases. For example, trans women who take estrogen may be at higher risk of breast cancer than cisgender men, but not higher risk than other women, says Joshua Safer, who directs the Mount Sinai Center for Transgender Medicine and Surgery in New York City. Trans women who take estrogen also have a slight risk of developing blood clots, but not higher than cisgender women’s risk of developing blood clots from taking estrogen-containing birth control. Transgender men taking testosterone may, like other men, have a higher risk of high cholesterol, Safer says, but existing data cannot say for sure.</p>



<p>Beyond hormone therapy, gender-affirming treatment can involve surgery for some transgender people. Current medical guidelines do not recommend genital surgery for minors, but some adolescents may have masculinizing chest surgery if they experience severe distress or discomfort from unwanted breast development. “This is a major decision that requires careful coordination between a family and their physicians,” Turban says.</p>



<p>Like other aspects of gender-affirming health care, surgery has been shown to improve mental health and quality of life for many. All but one of 58 individuals who had masculinizing chest surgery reported the procedure had an <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30286047/">overall positive impact on their lives</a> in a survey published in <em>Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery</em> in 2019.</p>



<div class="wp-block-sciencenews-content-sidebar">
<h3>Right timing&nbsp;</h3>



<p>For young children, gender-affirming health care is limited to providing support through a change in name and pronouns and clothing style, but no medication. Older adolescents may receive medical treatments, including puberty blockers, hormone therapy or surgery, if appropriate.</p>



<h5 class="has-text-align-center">When health care support is considered</h5>

</div>



<h4>Risk of regret</h4>



<p>Medical guidelines recommend that every stage of gender affirmation, from social transition to surgery, involves extensive conversations among children and their parents, physicians and mental health care providers — and informed consent from both adolescents and their parents for any medical procedures. “It’s not that you decide on your 12th birthday where you are when you’re 21,” de Vries says.</p>



<p>Some lawmakers who have pushed bills to ban puberty blockers and hormone therapy for minors have argued that children who receive gender-affirming treatment may regret it when they grow up. Regret is a risk. But current research says that regret following gender-affirming medical and surgical care is rare, Turban says.</p>



<p>One team tracked the development of 55 transgender adults in the Netherlands who received puberty blockers and gender-affirming hormones in adolescence, followed by transition-related surgery in early adulthood. After surgery, participants had similar quality of life and happiness as their cisgender peers. All were satisfied with their appearance and <a href="https://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/134/4/696">none regretted treatment</a>, according to a 2014 report in <em>Pediatrics</em>. A recent review of more than two dozen studies that include nearly 8,000 transgender patients who had gender-affirming surgeries similarly <a href="https://journals.lww.com/prsgo/fulltext/2021/03000/regret_after_gender_affirmation_surgery__a.22.aspx">showed that only about 1 percent regretted treatment</a>, researchers reported in March in<em> Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery-Global Open</em>.</p>



<p>A small percentage of people do choose to discontinue therapy. Among more than 800 adolescents who visited a gender identity clinic in the Netherlands over a 40-year period from 1972 to 2015, 1.9 percent of those who started taking puberty blockers <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29463477/">did not proceed with hormone therapy</a>, researchers reported in 2018 in the<em> Journal of Sexual Medicine</em>. And some adults who undergo gender-affirming treatments later decide to return to living as the gender assigned to them at birth, a process called detransitioning.</p>



<p>In a survey of nearly 28,000 transgender adults in the United States, about 2,200 had detransitioned. About 36 percent cited pressure from parents as a reason. Close to 33 percent reported pressure from community and 27 percent said they had trouble getting a job. Just under 11 percent said that <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33794108/">fluctuations in their gender factored into their detransition</a>, Turban and colleagues report in the June<em> LGBT Health</em>.</p>





<h4>Legal ramifications</h4>



<p>Legislation aiming to restrict gender-affirming health care may have more widespread consequences than preventing minors in some states from receiving treatment. Bills that portray gender-affirming health care as experimental or dangerous may make people who are questioning their gender reluctant to ask for help, Klein says. The bills may also make parents reluctant to seek help for their children even in places where treatment has not been made illegal.</p>



<p>These health care bills are just one aspect of a wave of legislation that some LGBTQ advocates say discriminates against the transgender community. A new law passed in Tennessee, but temporarily halted by a federal judge, requires businesses and government facilities to post signs if they allow transgender people to use bathrooms that match their gender identity. And several states, including Florida, Mississippi and Tennessee, now forbid transgender kids from playing on sports teams that match their gender identity. In late July, a federal judge prevented West Virginia from enforcing its sports ban.</p>



<div class="wp-block-sciencenews-content-sidebar alignright">

</div>



<p>“We know that a major driver of mental health problems among transgender youth is rejection of their gender identity,” Turban says. “Imagine that you heard powerful politicians pronouncing on the national stage that you’re confused, invalid and dangerous to people in bathrooms and sports leagues. It’s extraordinarily difficult for a child not to be negatively impacted by this rhetoric.”</p>



<p>Research is just emerging on how recent anti-trans legislation may affect transgender youth and their families. <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/350306037_I_am_afraid_for_those_kids_who_might_find_death_preferable_Parental_Figures'_Reactions_and_Coping_Strategies_to_Bans_on_Gender_Affirming_Care_for_Transgender_and_Gender_Diverse_Youth">Parents of transgender children expressed anxiety about the increased stigma their kids may face</a>, and the potential health impacts of lack of access to gender-affirming care, according to a small online survey published on July 29 in <em>Psychology of Sexual Orientation and Gender Diversity</em>. “I am afraid for those kids who might find death preferable to being forced to go through the bodily changes of puberty for the wrong gender,” says a Texas mother quoted in the study.</p>



<p>Daniel can relate. “It’s frustrating. It angers me,” they say. “But it’s also so confusing, because what is the point of stopping people from being who they are, and doing things that could possibly save their life?”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/female-hummingbird-flashy-feathers-males-harassment-attacks">Female hummingbirds may sport flashy feathers to avoid being harassed</a></h4>

              
                <p>Some female hummingbirds don flashy feathers to avoid being bothered by other hummingbirds, a new study suggests.</p>



<p>Male white-necked jacobin hummingbirds (<em>Florisuga mellivora</em>) have bright blue heads and throats. Females tend to have more drab hues, but some sport the blue coloring too. Appearing fit and fine to impress potential mates can often explain animals’ vibrant colors. But mate choice doesn’t seem to drive these females’ pretty plumage since males don’t appear to prefer the blue females. Instead, bright colors <a href="https://www.cell.com/current-biology/fulltext/S0960-9822(21)01033-2">may help lady birds blend in with the guys, and as a result, feed for longer without harassment</a> from other hummingbirds, researchers report August 26 in <em>Current Biology</em>.</p>



<p>Beyond vying for mates, animals often also compete for territory, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/piggybacking-tadpoles-are-epic-food-beggars">parental attention</a>, social ranks and food (<em>SN: 4/7/16</em>). Mating choices don’t capture all those other interactions and can’t always explain animals’ looks, says Jay Falk, an evolutionary biologist at the University of Washington in Seattle.</p>



<p>To begin investigating why some female jacobins have colorful blue plumage, Falk and colleagues captured and released over 400 of the birds in Gamboa, Panama, using genetics to determine their sex. Most females had drab colors — olive green heads and backs and mottled throats. But nearly 30 percent of females had the shimmery blue noggins that all juveniles have and that are characteristic of adult males.</p>



<p>These birds develop the bright colors in their adolescence, when the birds aren’t yet looking for mates, and for some lady hummers, the colors persist into adulthood when most females drop the bright colors. If these colors in females were driven by mate choice, then this is “the exact opposite of what you would expect,” says Falk, who did the work while at the Cornell Lab of Ornithology and the Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute in Gamboa.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" width="680" height="294" src="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/082521_cw_hummingbird_inline1.jpg" alt="illustration of a female bird with normal coloration, a male bird with a blue head and throat and a juvenile bird with a blue head and a peach throat" class="wp-image-3103061" srcset="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/082521_cw_hummingbird_inline1.jpg 680w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/082521_cw_hummingbird_inline1-330x143.jpg 330w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><figcaption><span class="caption wp-caption-3103061">Female white-necked jacobins (one illustrated at left) typically have a drab, olive green head and back, paired with a mottled throat. But about 30 percent of females have shiny blue heads and throats and look similar to adult males (center) as well as juveniles of both sexes (right).</span><span class="credit wp-credit-3103061">Jillian Ditner</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>In another experiment, the team set a taxidermy bird that was either a drab female, male or a blue-headed female at each of a pair of hummingbird feeders and compared how live birds reacted to the stuffed dummies. Male birds seemed to prefer drab-looking females, sometimes performing <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/costas-hummingbirds-singing-tail-feathers">swooping courtship dives</a> (<em>SN: 4/12/18</em>). Visitors to the feeders more frequently attempted to mate with green female body doubles than males or females with male-mimicking blue coloration.</p>



<p>White-necked jacobins can also be very aggressive, Falk says. Personality-wise, they’re “like the show-off jocks of the hummingbird world.” At the feeders, preserved females with dull green hues more frequently endured attacks when the feeder next door featured a stuffed male or a blue-colored female. Harassment came not only from jacobins but also from other hummingbird species, suggesting an even greater benefit of bright colors. “It’s really cool that these other species are paying attention to the differences between males and females,” Falk says.</p>





<p>The researchers next implanted tiny tracking tags into wild birds so that the team could tally up birds’ time at feeders that detected the tags. Brightly colored females made more visits to feeders, particularly ones with more sugary nectar, and spent more time there than their muted counterparts, the researchers found.</p>



<p>Being able to fly under the radar and eat in peace more frequently may make the brighter female birds more fit than other females. “Hummingbirds have the highest metabolic rate of any vertebrate on Earth,” says Ola Fincke, an evolutionary biologist at the University of Oklahoma in Norman who was not part of the study. Greater access to better food could make those animals healthier, though the new study looked only at hummingbird feeders, and it’s not clear whether the same trend would apply to foraging from flowers in the wild.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Though it’s not clear yet what drives such feather finery — whether genetics, hormones or something else — this is an “exciting example” of an evolved trait that helps females blend in with males to avoid harassment, says Sara Lipshutz, an evolutionary biologist at Loyola University Chicago who was not involved with the work.</p>



<p>The study also helps put the focus on female birds, which haven’t garnered as much research attention as males. For a long time, Lipshutz says, researchers “have been ignoring females — 50 percent of vertebrate animals.”</p>
