              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/covid-testing-school-works-coronavirus-pandemic-reopening">COVID-19 testing in schools works. So why aren’t more doing it?</a></h4>

              
                <p>In August 2020, the school superintendent in Omaha, Neb., approached a microbiology lab at the local university’s medical center. School districts across the country were starting to design pilot programs for routine COVID-19 testing in the coming fall semester, and Omaha Public Schools wanted to join the trend.</p>



<p>The result? During Omaha’s pilot of frequent, asymptomatic testing, the rate of cases detected in the school testing program was <a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2784428">six times as high</a> as the case rate reported by traditional testing for symptomatic students only. The pilot program detected 70 cases per 1,000 students, compared with 12 per 1,000 in the official tally reported by the local public health department, researchers report September 22 in <em>JAMA Network Open</em>.</p>



<p>“Asymptomatic screening dramatically increases case detection among students and staff in the K through 12 setting,” says M. Jana Broadhurst, a microbiologist at the University of Nebraska Medical Center who led the team that designed and implemented pilot programs for the school district. In other words, regular testing of all students and staff will catch far more COVID-19 cases than simply testing those who demonstrate COVID-19 symptoms or have a known exposure to the virus. Catching those cases is crucial to nipping outbreaks in the bud and keeping kids in school and healthy.</p>

<p>But this fall, Omaha Public Schools does not have a COVID-19 testing program at all. Why? “The absence of public health guidance on how to utilize and act upon those test results,” Broadhurst says.</p>



<p>Omaha isn’t alone. Throughout the United States, numerous K–12 schools have struggled to implement routine COVID-19 testing, despite expansive funding from the federal government and a recent surge in cases, fueled by the <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/delta-variant-studies-cdc-coronavirus-covid-pandemic">delta variant</a> (<em>SN: 7/30/21</em>). This surge has taken a huge <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/covid-coronavirus-pfizer-vaccine-kids-5-11-safe-works-infection">toll on children</a>, demonstrating for many experts the need for deploying testing as a safety measure (<em>SN: 9/20/21</em>). Many school districts have seen <a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/few-masks-sick-kids-packed-ers-how-one-districts-first-four-weeks-of-school-went-bad">more cases among students</a> — and more shut-down classrooms — in fall of 2021 than they did last fall, before vaccines were widely available.</p>



<p>But major hurdles to testing include a lack of clear guidance on how testing programs should work, obtaining tests, gaining consent from parents and communicating the value of testing to families and staff in increasingly polarized environments.</p>



<h3>Putting testing to the test</h3>



<p>In the last year, both real-world testing pilots like Omaha’s and simulations of different testing scenarios have shown that by routinely testing students and staff, school leaders can identify cases and quickly pull infected people out of the classroom, preventing widespread outbreaks.</p>



<p>“Testing has been widely used at institutions ranging from colleges and universities to the NBA,” says Alyssa Bilinski, a biostatistician at Brown University School of Public Health in Providence, R.I. Testing programs “find people who are currently infectious and isolate them so they don&#8217;t spread COVID-19 further.”</p>



<p>At the same time, Bilinski says, testing can provide school leaders with valuable insight into <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coronavirus-covid-kids-schools-reopening-cases">coronavirus transmission in the classroom</a> — information that can inform decisions about increasing or pulling back on other safety measures (<em>SN: 8/9/21</em>).</p>



<p>“Routine testing really has the potential to greatly reduce within-school COVID-19 transmission, and in some cases, even completely eliminate it,” agrees Divya Vohra, an epidemiologist at Mathematica, a research organization with headquarters in Princeton, N.J., who studies testing pilot programs. “We think that it really is a very powerful tool when you layer it on top of all of the other mitigation strategies that schools are implementing, like masking and distancing.”</p>



<div class="wp-block-sciencenews-content-sidebar">
<h3>Testing strategies</h3>



<p>According to computer simulations, routine COVID-19 testing may reduce in-school virus transmission by up to 100 percent. In the left scenario, the community around this school is facing high case rates (200 cases per 100,000 residents in the last week), while in the right scenario, the community is facing low case rates (25 cases per 100,000 residents). Pooled testing, in which an entire classroom is PCR-tested at once, is the most successful at reducing transmission. Serial antigen testing (antigen tests two days in a row) is more successful than single antigen testing if community cases are high. All scenarios assume that 100 percent of students and staff at the school participate in testing.</p>

</div>



<p>Some testing strategies <a href="https://www.mathematica.org/publications/implementing-covid-19-routine-testing-in-k-12-schools-lessons-and-recommendations-from-pilot-sites">can reduce in-school coronavirus transmission by 100 percent</a>, Vohra and colleagues reported July 26 in a study posted on Mathematica’s website. Pool testing, a method in which samples from an entire classroom are combined and PCR-tested together, is particularly effective at cutting down on transmission when case numbers in the community around the school are high, the models of testing scenarios suggest. This testing method is highly accurate, because PCR tests identify coronavirus DNA in samples, and it provides results more quickly than if each student’s test was processed one by one.</p>



<p>“You&#8217;re more likely to catch an infection that an antigen test might miss,” Vohra says. Antigen tests detect proteins on the surface of the coronavirus; they provide results in just 15 minutes and are easy to administer in a school setting. While these tests are less accurate than PCR tests, they are almost as capable of reducing transmission when used once a week or more, especially when community transmission is lower, Vohra says.&nbsp;Testing is most effective when all students and staff are routinely swabbed, but programs may still identify cases when just a subset of the school population is included.</p>



<h3>Start-up challenges</h3>



<p>Despite the value of routine COVID-19 testing in schools, any school administrator aiming to test their students faces numerous challenges. Setting up such a program is “like taking the whole entire school on a field trip to somewhere that nobody&#8217;s ever been,” says Leah Perkinson, a lead coordinator of K–12 testing pilot programs run by New York City–based nonprofit Rockefeller Foundation.</p>



<p>The first test, she says, is the most difficult. To make that test happen, school leaders have numerous decisions to make. They have to determine which testing strategy to use — PCR or pooled PCR or antigen; nasal swabs or saliva tests — and then procure enough of those tests for hundreds of students and staff. They need to determine who will conduct the tests, when and where testing will occur, how to report test results and how to collect consent from students’ parents and guardians. And, crucially, school officials need to determine what will happen when a test result is positive: Who needs to quarantine and for how long?</p>



<aside class="wp-block-sciencenews-inline-related-post alignleft">
<h4>
<a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/editors-picks/2019-novel-coronavirus-outbreak">See all our coverage of the coronavirus outbreak</a>
</h4>
</aside>



<p>Many of these decisions are, in essence, public health decisions — yet school leaders are not trained in public health. As a result, schools need “coordination and support coming from experts, particularly at the state and federal level” to set up routine testing, Vohra says.</p>



<p>Like numerous other aspects of the pandemic, coordination and support for school testing varies greatly across states. Some, including <a href="https://coronavirus.utah.gov/education">Utah</a>, <a href="https://www.doe.k12.de.us/Page/4242">Delaware</a>, <a href="https://covid.ri.gov/testing/testing-k-12-students-and-staff">Rhode Island</a> and <a href="https://testing.covid19.ca.gov/school-testing/">California</a>, have taken advantage of funding from this <a href="https://www2.ed.gov/about/offices/list/ope/caresact.html">past spring’s federal stimulus package</a> to buy tests for their public school districts and provide guidelines on how those tests should be used. But in other places, state-level leaders have refused funding entirely, leaving school districts on their own.</p>



<p>At the federal level, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends that schools set up regular COVID-19 testing but offers <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/schools-childcare/k-12-guidance.html#anchor_1625662107144">very limited guidance on specifics</a>. Instead, the agency recommends that school leaders coordinate with their local public health departments.</p>



<p>To fill in the testing information gap for school leaders that lack state guidance, the National Institutes of Health, the Rockefeller Foundation and others have created detailed online resources that let school and public health leaders compare testing strategies and connect with test providers. Still, Perkinson says, these resources may be challenging for school administrators to find and use because the information is “not all in one centralized place.”</p>



<h3>Quarantine queries</h3>



<p>Another major challenge that routine school testing programs face, Vohra says, is determining what happens when a student or staff member tests positive. “If you&#8217;re identifying more cases, then that&#8217;s going to mean that more students are going to be isolating or quarantining,” she says.</p>



<p>Some schools have adjusted their quarantine policies to minimize the number of students missing out on in-person learning. Instead of quarantining an entire classroom, for example, a school may require only those students who sit within six feet of an infected student to quarantine. Policies may also differ for students who are and are not vaccinated. And there is no right answer when it comes to the best strategy, Vohra says.</p>



<p>To help local leaders understand different test and quarantine combinations, Vohra and colleagues <a href="https://covid-school-testing.mathematica.org/start">built a dashboard</a> based on the results from their modeling study. Users can plug in their testing goals, quarantine policies, community transmission rates and more; the tool offers comparisons of how well different testing strategies fare in reaching those goals.</p>



<p>Another strategy — one not included in the dashboard — is called “test to stay.” Instead of requiring quarantines for students who are exposed to the coronavirus, officials may require those students to get tested at a higher frequency, such as one test a day for a week. A study of secondary schools in the United Kingdom shows that schools where close-contact students were tested daily had similar success in identifying and isolating COVID-19 cases as schools where contacts were all required to isolate immediately. In other words, the “test-to-stay” <a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(21)01908-5/fulltext">strategy saved in-person school days while still catching cases</a>, the researchers report September 14 in the <em>Lancet</em>.</p>



<p>In Utah, public schools are required by state law to conduct a <a href="https://coronavirus-download.utah.gov/School/Test_to_Stay.pdf">“test-to-stay event”</a> when they face an outbreak. In these events, schools host mass testing days; all students must test negative to continue attending classes. A pilot version of the program <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coronavirus-covid-school-testing-kids-safe">saved over 100,000 days of in-person instruction</a> for about 60,000 students, according to a CDC report published in May 2021 (<em>SN: 8/13/21</em>).</p>



<p>This fall, the program has been implemented statewide but is facing new challenges, says Maggie Graul, an epidemiologist with Utah’s state public health department who manages the program.</p>



<p>The state defines a school outbreak as 2 percent of the student body in large schools or 30 students in small schools testing positive within two weeks — a slightly higher threshold than was used in the pilot program. Schools, public health departments and other local institutions that support “test-to-stay events” are often hesitant to set up mass testing until they hit that outbreak threshold, as they may face community pushback for testing before it is required, Graul says. As a result, she says, the school outbreaks “are actually larger, and we&#8217;re not able to contain them as well as last year” during the pilot program.</p>



<h3>Opt in versus opt out</h3>



<p>A routine school testing program is most effective when all students and staff participate. If testing is voluntary, the families who opt in are likely to be the same families who also follow other COVID-19 precautions, such as wearing masks in public spaces. But schools that institute these programs have struggled with everything from collecting easy-to-misplace consent forms from students to gaining consent in the first place from some parents.</p>



<p>The Rockefeller Foundation’s pilot programs found that, even when families and school staff expressed support for testing in the abstract, it was much harder to get people onboard for a specific testing regimen. For instance, staff opt-in rates at the foundation’s six pilot sites ranged from 25 percent in Tulsa, Okla., to 100 percent in Los Angeles.</p>



<div class="wp-block-sciencenews-content-sidebar">
<h3>Real-world testing</h3>



<p>Five schools in Los Angeles took part in a pilot COVID-19 testing program. From late March to late May, the schools all together administered over 200 tests a week — peaking at almost 2,000 tests a week in late April. During this time, the overall test positivity rate in these schools (0.01 percent) was much lower than the positivity rate for Los Angeles County (ranging between 0.5 percent and 1 percent). This indicates that coronavirus transmission was lower in the schools that regularly tested their students and staff than in the wider community. (No tests were administered during the week of April 9 during spring break.)</p>

<p>To increase the share of students who get tested, some schools use an opt-out strategy. Rather than students needing a consent form to get tested, they’re automatically enrolled in testing and need a permission form to get out of the program. Baltimore has used this strategy, Perkinson says. New York City also piloted an opt-out strategy in the 2020–2021 school year, requiring all students who attended class in-person to participate in weekly random testing — essentially a participation rate of 100 percent. In fall 2021, however, testing has become opt-in instead of opt-out. <a href="https://gothamist.com/news/less-quarter-nyc-public-school-kids-have-opted-covid-19-testing-school">Fewer than a quarter of students</a> had opted in as of October 6.</p>



<p>In parts of the country where COVID-19 safety measures in schools have become intensely political, convincing people to opt in can be challenging. Fall 2021 has seen numerous parent protests over these measures — ranging from angry crowds at school PTA meetings to individual families pulling their children out of public schools.</p>



<p>Routine testing programs have not faced the same degree of scrutiny as mask mandates or vaccination requirements. But “testing has been politicized as much as every other aspect of the response to this pandemic,” Broadhurst says. Some of Rockefeller’s pilot programs faced some “families and community members who didn&#8217;t really see the value of testing and didn&#8217;t really think that schools should be in the business of testing,” Vohra says.</p>



<p>It’s not just politics, either. “Testing can&#8217;t happen in a vacuum,” Broadhurst says. If a student tests positive, not only is this student out of school for two weeks, but also a whole family may be out of work in order to quarantine and care for that child, losing crucial income. This creates tension between public health measures and economic security, Broadhurst says. Integrating testing programs with other services —such as free meals and a space to isolate — for socioeconomically vulnerable families may help them agree to participate in testing programs.</p>



<h3>Keeping an eye on the goal</h3>



<p>Despite the many challenges of routine testing, school leaders and researchers who work on K–12 COVID-19 testing programs are optimistic about this strategy’s potential in the current school year and beyond.</p>



<p>“This is public health; it is not public perfect,” Perkinson says. If a school is not able to meet an ideal testing benchmark for lowering transmission, every individual test is still a win, she says. Every positive result may identify a case before it turns into an outbreak.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/~r/plos/Blog/~3/x_PwWlwCtec/">What a difference a data repository makes: Six ways depositing data maximizes the impact of your science</a></h4>

              
                <!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/loose.dtd">
<html><body><p>Data is key to verification, replication, reuse, and enhanced understanding of research conclusions. When your data is in a repository&mdash;instead of an old hard drive, say, or even a Supporting Information file&mdash;its impact and its relevance are magnified. Here are six ways that putting your data in a public repository can help your research go further.</p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator">



<h2>1. You can&rsquo;t lose data that&rsquo;s in a public data repository</h2>



<p>Have you ever lost track of a dataset? Maybe you&rsquo;ve upgraded your computer or moved to a new institution. Maybe you deleted a file by mistake, or simply can&rsquo;t remember the name of the file you&rsquo;re looking for. No matter the cause, lost data can be embarrassing and time consuming. You&rsquo;re unable to supply requested information to journals during the submission process or to readers after publication. Future meta analyses or systematic reviews are impossible. And you may end up redoing experiments in order to move forward with your line of inquiry. With data securely deposited in a repository with a unique DOI for tracking, archival standards to prevent loss, and metadata and readme materials to make sure your data is used correctly, fulfilling journal requests or revisiting past work is easy.</p>



<h2>2. Public data repositories support understanding, reanalysis and reuse</h2>



<p>Transparently posting raw data to a public repository supports trustworthy, reproducible scientific research. Insight into the data and analysis gives readers a deeper understanding of published research articles. Offering the opportunity for others to interpret results demonstrates integrity and opens new avenues for discussion and collaboration. Machine-readable data formatting allows the work to be incorporated into future systematic reviews or meta analyses, expanding its usefulness.</p>



<h2>3. Public data repositories facilitate discovery</h2>



<p>Even the best data can&rsquo;t be used unless it can be found. Detailed metadata, database indexing, and bidirectional linking to and from related articles helps to make data in public repositories easily searchable&mdash;so that it reaches the readers who need it most, maximizing the impact and influence of the study as a whole.</p>



<h2>4. Public data repositories reflect the true value of data</h2>



<p>Data shouldn&rsquo;t be treated like an ancillary bi-product of a research article. Data <em>is research</em>. And researchers deserve academic credit for collecting, capturing and curating the data they generate through their work. Public repositories help to illustrate the true importance and lasting relevance of datasets by assigning them their own unique DOI, distinct from that of related research articles&mdash;so that datasets can accumulate citations in their own right.</p>



<h2>5. Public data demonstrates rigor</h2>



<p>There&rsquo;s no better way to illustrate the rigor of your results than explaining exactly how you achieved them. Sharing data lets you demonstrate your credibility and inspires confidence in readers by contextualizing results and facilitating reproducibility.</p>



<h2>6. Research with data in public data repositories attracts more citations</h2>



<p>A <a href="https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0230416">2020 study</a> of more than 500,000 published research articles found articles that link to data in a public repository have a 25% higher citation rate on average than articles where data is available on request or as Supporting Information. The precise reasons for the association remain unclear. Are researchers who deposit carefully curated data in a repository also more likely to produce rigorous, citation-worthy research? Are researchers with the time and resources to devote to data curation and deposition more established in their careers, and therefore more highly cited? Are readers more likely to cite research when they trust that they can verify the conclusions with data? Perhaps some combination?&nbsp;</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/atomic-clock-general-relativity-time-warp-millimeter-physics">An atomic clock measured how general relativity warps time across a millimeter</a></h4>

              
                <p>A millimeter might not seem like much. But even a distance that small can alter the flow of time.</p>



<p>According to Einstein’s theory of gravity, general relativity, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/einsteins-genius-changed-sciences-perception-gravity">clocks tick faster</a> the farther they are from Earth or another massive object (<em>SN: 10/4/15</em>). Theoretically, that should hold true even for very small differences in the heights of clocks. Now an incredibly sensitive atomic clock has spotted that speedup across a millimeter-sized sample of atoms, revealing the effect over a smaller height difference than ever before. <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2109.12238">Time moved slightly faster</a> at the top of that sample than at the bottom, researchers report September 24 at arXiv.org.</p>



<p>“This is fantastic,” says theoretical physicist Marianna Safronova of the University of Delaware in Newark, who was not involved with the research. “I thought it would take much longer to get to this point.” The extreme precision of the atomic clock’s measurement suggests the potential to use the sensitive timepieces to test other fundamental concepts in physics.</p>



<p>An inherent property of atoms allows scientists to use them as timepieces.&nbsp; Atoms exist at different energy levels, and a specific frequency of light makes them jump from one level to another. That frequency — the rate of wiggling of the light’s waves — serves the same purpose as a clock’s regularly ticking second hand. For atoms farther from the ground, time runs faster, so a greater frequency of light will be needed to make the energy jump. Previously, scientists have measured this frequency shift, known as gravitational redshift, across a height difference of <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/everything-really-relative">33 centimeters</a> (<em>SN: 9/23/10</em>).</p>



<p>In the new study, physicist Jun Ye of JILA in Boulder, Colo., and colleagues used a clock made up of roughly 100,000 ultracold strontium atoms. Those atoms were arranged in a lattice, meaning that the atoms sat at a series of different heights as if standing on the rungs of a ladder. Mapping out how the frequency changed over those heights revealed a shift. After correcting for non-gravitational effects that could shift the frequency, the clock’s frequency changed by about a hundredth of a quadrillionth of a percent over a millimeter, just the amount expected according to general relativity.</p>

<p>What’s more, after taking data for about 90 hours, comparing the ticking of upper and lower sections of the clock, the scientists determined their technique could measure the relative ticking rates to a precision of 0.76 millionths of a trillionth of a percent. That makes it a record for the most precise frequency comparison ever performed.</p>



<p>In a related study, also submitted September 24 to arXiv.org, another team of researchers loaded strontium atoms into specific portions of a lattice to <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2109.12237">create six clocks in one</a>. “It’s very exciting what they did, as well,” Safronova says.</p>



<p>Shimon Kolkowitz of the University of Wisconsin–Madison and colleagues measured the relative ticking rates of two of the clocks, separated by about six millimeters, to a precision of 8.9 millionths of a trillionth of a percent, which itself would have been a new record had it not been beat by Ye’s group. With that sensitivity, scientists could detect a difference between two clocks ticking at a rate so slightly different that they’d disagree by just one second after about 300 billion years. Ye’s clock could detect an even smaller discrepancy between the two halves of the clock of one second amassed over roughly 4 trillion years. Although Kolkowitz’s team didn’t yet measure gravitational redshift, the setup could be used for that in the future.</p>

<p>Authors of both studies declined to comment, as the papers have not yet been through the peer-review process.</p>



<p>The measurements’ precision hints at future possibilities, says theoretical physicist Victor Flambaum of the University of New South Wales in Sydney. For example, “atomic clocks are now so precise that they may be used to search for dark matter,” he says. This stealthy, unidentified substance lurks invisibly in the cosmos; certain hypothesized types of dark matter could alter clocks’ tick-tocks. Scientists could also compare atomic clocks made of different isotopes — atoms with varied numbers of neutrons in their nuclei — which might hint at undiscovered new particles. And atomic clocks can study whether <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/units-measure-are-getting-fundamental-upgrade">fundamental constants</a> of nature might vary (<em>SN: 11/2/16</em>).</p>



<p>The ability to precisely compare different clocks is also important for a major goal of timekeeping: <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/atomic-clock-new-measurement-time-redefining-second">updating the definition of a second</a> (<em>SN: 3/24/21</em>). The length of a second is currently defined using an <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/kilogram-just-got-revamp-unit-time-might-be-next">earlier generation of atomic clocks</a> that are not as precise as newer ones like those used in the two new studies (<em>SN: 5/20/19</em>).</p>



<p>“There is a very bright future for the clocks,” Safronova says.</p>

                <p><em>By</em> <a href="https://emmayoung.net/">Emma Young</a></p>



<p>Imagine that a neighbour asks for a favour — to help move some garden furniture at the weekend, say. Now imagine that, instead, they explain that they’d lined up a friend to help, but that friend has become ill, and you’ll only be required if they’re not better in time.</p>



<p>Rather than a firm favour, this second scenario involves what the authors of a <a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2021-52356-001">new paper</a> in the <em>Journal of Experimental Psychology: Applied</em> dub a &#8220;maybe favour&#8221;. And, Michael K. Zurn at the University of Cologne and colleagues report, we are more likely to agree to grant these favours than ones that we know for sure we’ll have to come good on. This might not be surprising in itself — but the team goes on to show that exploiting the “maybe favour” effect could have big implications for society.</p>

<p>In a preliminary study, 113 students were presented with various vignettes describing requests for help in moving furniture, either from a close friend or a stranger. The amount of helping time required varied from 10 minutes to an hour, and the likelihood that the participant would actually have to help — in the case of the original helper still being sick — was estimated at 99%, 50%, 10% or 1%. Unsurprisingly, the participants were more likely say they’d help a friend than a stranger. But offers of help to a stranger became more likely when the chance of being needed was low vs high – when, in other words, a &#8220;maybe favour&#8221; was requested.</p>



<p>For close friends, the team in fact found the opposite pattern. They suspect that if a close friend says that they <em>might</em> need help, this signals that their need isn’t really very high. But the participants’ greater willingness to grant a &#8220;maybe favour&#8221; to a stranger suggests that just showing this willingness brings the benefits that come from granting a favour, while reducing the expected costs. These benefits could involve simply feeling good about agreeing to help someone else out.</p>



<p>Of course, for every 100 granted and delivered &#8220;firm favours&#8221;, 100 &#8220;maybe favours&#8221; will not result in the same total number of good deeds. But, the team reasoned, <em>if </em>we are much more likely to agree to maybe favours than firm favours, this could result in more good deeds overall. So they explored this next.</p>



<p>In two studies on a total of more than 1,000 US residents, participants were offered a 20 cent payment for taking part. After they had read a description of the non-profit environmental organisation The Conservation Fund, half were asked if they wanted to donate their payment to this charity (granting the equivalent of a firm favour). The rest were asked if they wanted to donate their payment, but with the promise that 5% of these donations would be cancelled, and no donation would actually be made. This was the &#8220;maybe favour&#8221;.</p>



<p>In the first study, 31% of those in the definite-donation group donated their payment, while 47% of those in the maybe group did. Even though 5% of the donations from people in this second group were cancelled, this meant that the team donated a total of US$29.96 from them, but only US $20.60 from the definite-donation group. In a replication of this study, the percentages who agreed to donate were similar, though not quite as different, at 38% and 47%. Though the effect size was smaller this time, the absolute donations from the &#8220;maybe&#8221; group were still higher ($17.30 vs $15.80).</p>



<p>In further studies that also involved requests for small donations to charity, the team found that whether someone made a definite donation or a maybe-donation — or made a maybe-donation but learned that their donation had been cancelled — they got the same &#8220;feel good&#8221; feelings as a result. Importantly, then, adding a &#8220;maybe&#8221; to the donation didn’t affect the subjective benefits of granting it.</p>



<p>It’s worth highlighting one other statistic from the pooled study results: though only 5% of maybe-donators didn’t actually give away the money, donation rates on average were 18% higher for this group. This might also reflect a known cognitive bias: that we tend to overweight small probabilities (and underweight high probabilities). So, though the probability of having the donation revoked was small, it had an over-sized impact on decision-making.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Overall, “our findings show that with a simple ‘maybe’ we can capitalise on fundamental biases of human cognition to get more good deeds done,” the researchers write.</p>



<p>In theory, introducing a &#8220;maybe&#8221; to a pledge might have a big net impact not just on the total value of charitable donations, say, but also blood or organ donations, or a willingness to help refugees, the team suggests.</p>



<p>Of course, these studies involved very small amounts of money that the participants didn’t possess in the first place. More work is needed to explore how this maybe effect might play out in the real world. But, the team concludes, “we think that in times where altruism and solidarity are needed more than ever, this simple intervention may be used to really get more good deeds done.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/nasa-lucy-first-mission-trojan-asteroids-launch-space">5 cool things to know about NASA’s Lucy mission to the Trojan asteroids</a></h4>

              
                <p>For the first time, a spacecraft is headed to Jupiter’s odd Trojan asteroids. What <a href="http://lucy.swri.edu/">Lucy</a> finds there could provide a fresh peek into the history of the solar system.</p>



<p>“Lucy will profoundly change our understanding of planetary evolution in our solar system,” Adriana Ocampo, a planetary scientist at NASA Headquarters in Washington, D.C., said at a news briefing October 14.</p>



<p>The mission is set to launch from the Kennedy Space Center at Cape Canaveral, Fla., as early as October 16. <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/press-release/nasa-sets-coverage-invites-public-to-virtually-join-lucy-launch">Live coverage</a> will air on NASA TV beginning at 5 a.m. EDT, in anticipation of a 5:34 a.m. blast off.</p>



<p>The Trojan asteroids are two groups of space rocks that are gravitationally trapped in the same orbit as Jupiter around the sun. One group of Trojans orbits ahead of Jupiter; the other follows the gas giant around the sun. Planetary scientists think the Trojans could have formed at different distances from the sun before getting mixed together in their current homes. The asteroids could also be some of the oldest and most pristine objects in the solar system.</p>





<p>The mission will mark several other firsts, from the types of objects it will visit to the way it powers its instruments. Here are five cool things to know about our first visit to the Trojans.</p>



<h4>1. The Trojan asteroids are a solar system time capsule.</h4>



<p>The Trojans occupy spots known as Lagrangian points, where the gravity from the sun and from Jupiter effectively cancel each other out. That means their orbits are stable for billions of years.</p>



<p>“They were probably placed in their orbits by the final gasp of the planet formation process,” the mission’s principal investigator Hal Levison, a planetary scientist at Southwest Research Institute in Boulder, Colo., &nbsp;said September 28 in a news briefing.</p>



<p>But that doesn’t mean the asteroids are all alike. Scientists can tell from Earth that some Trojans are gray and some are red, indicating that they might have formed in different places before settling in their current orbits. Maybe the gray ones formed closer to the sun, and the red ones formed farther from the sun, Levison speculated.</p>



<p>Studying the Trojans’ similarities and differences can help planetary scientists tease out whether and when the <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/rock-rattle-and-roll">giant planets moved around</a> before settling into their present positions (<em>SN: 4/20/12</em>). “This is telling us something really fundamental about the formation of the solar system,” Levison said.</p>



<h4>2. The spacecraft will visit more individual objects than any other single spacecraft.&nbsp;</h4>



<p>Lucy will visit eight asteroids, including their moons. Over its 12-year mission, it will visit one asteroid in the main asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter, and seven Trojans, two of which are binary systems where a pair of asteroids orbit each other.</p>



<p>“We are going to be visiting the most asteroids ever with one mission,” planetary scientist Cathy Olkin, Lucy’s deputy principal investigator, said in the Oct. 14 briefing.</p>



<p>The spacecraft will observe the asteroids’ composition, shape, gravity and geology for clues to where they formed and how they got to the Lagrangian points.</p>



<p>The spacecraft’s first destination, in April 2025, will be an asteroid in the main belt. Next, it will visit five asteroids in the group of Trojans that orbit the sun ahead of Jupiter: Eurybates and its satellite Queta in August 2027; Polymele in September 2027; Leucus in April 2028; and Orus in November 2028. Finally, the spacecraft will shift to Jupiter’s other side and visit the twin asteroids Patroclus and Menoetius in the trailing group of space rocks in March 2033.</p>



<p>The spacecraft won’t land on any of its targets, but it will swoop within 965 kilometers of their surfaces at speeds of 3 to 5 meters per second relative to the asteroids’ speed through space.</p>



<p>There’s no need to worry about collisions while zipping through these asteroid clusters, Levison said. Although there are about 7,000 known Trojans, they’re very far apart. “If you were standing on any one of our targets, you wouldn’t be able to tell you were part of the swarm,” he said.</p>

<h4>3. Lucy will have a weird flight path.</h4>



<p>In order to make so many stops, Lucy will need to take a complex path. First, the spacecraft will swoop past Earth twice to get a gravitational boost from our planet that will help propel it onward to its first asteroid.</p>



<p>The closest Earth flyby, in October 2022, will take it within 300 kilometers of the planet’s surface, closer than the International Space Station, the Hubble Space Telescope and many satellites, Olkin said. Observers on Earth might even be able to see it. “I’m hoping to go near where it flies past and look up and see Lucy flying by a year from now,” she said.</p>



<p>Then in December 2030, after more than a year exploring the “leading” swarm of Trojans, Lucy will come back to the vicinity of Earth for one more boost. That final gravitational slingshot will send the spacecraft to the other side of the sun to visit the “trailing” swarm. This will make Lucy the first spacecraft ever to venture to the outer solar system and come back near Earth again.</p>



<h4>4. Lucy will travel farther from the sun than any other solar-powered craft.</h4>



<p>Another record Lucy will break has to do with its power source: the sun. Lucy will run on solar power out to 850 million kilometers away from the sun, making it the farthest-flung solar powered spacecraft ever.</p>



<p>To accomplish that, Lucy has a pair of enormous solar arrays. Each 10-sided array is more than 7.3 meters across and includes about 4,000 solar cells per panel, Lucy project manager Donya Douglas-Bradshaw said in a news briefing on October 13. Standing on one end, Lucy and its solar panels would be as tall as a five-story building.</p>



<p>“It’s a very intricate, sophisticated design,” she said. The advantage of using solar power is that the team can adjust how much power the spacecraft needs based on how far from the sun it is.</p>





<h4>5. The inspiration for Lucy’s name is decidedly earthbound.</h4>



<p>NASA missions are often named for famous scientists, or with acronyms that describe what the mission will do. Lucy, on the other hand, is named after a fossil.</p>



<p>The idea that the Trojans hold secrets to the history of the solar system is part of how the mission got its unusual name. To understand, go back to 1974, when paleoanthropologist Donald Johanson and a graduate student <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/century/human-evolution-origins-fossils-paleoanthropology">discovered a fossil of a human ancestor</a> who had lived 3.2 million years ago. After listening to the Beatles song “Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds” at camp that night, Johanson’s team named the fossil hominid “Lucy.” (In a poetic echo, the first asteroid the Lucy spacecraft will visit is named Donaldjohanson.)</p>



<p>Planetary scientists hope the study of the Trojans will revolutionize our understanding of the solar system’s history in the same way that studying Lucy’s fossil revolutionized our understanding of human history.</p>



<p>“We think these asteroids are fossils of solar system formation,” Levison said. So his team named the spacecraft after the fossil.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The spacecraft even carries a diamond in one of its instruments, to help split beams of light. Said planetary scientist Phil Christensen of Arizona State University in Tempe at the Oct. 14 briefing: “We truly are sending a diamond into the sky with Lucy.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://blog.arxiv.org/2021/10/14/academic-societies-continue-strong-support-of-arxiv/">Academic societies continue strong support of arXiv</a></h4>

              
                <p>Since 2019, seven academic societies have contributed to arXiv with funding and expertise. This type of steady support directly helps arXiv keep pace with exponential growth in usage and achieve its mission to provide an open research sharing platform where scholars can share and discover new, relevant, and emerging science, and establish their contribution to advancing research.</p>
<p>This year, the <strong><a href="https://www.aps.org/">American Physical Society</a></strong> (APS) increased its contribution fivefold and became the first society to contribute as a Gold Affiliate. In addition to APS, the <strong>Association for Computing Machinery, the American Astronomical Society, and the American Mathematical Society</strong> have all pledged to continue supporting arXiv in 2022. arXiv is grateful for this support.</p>
<p>“For 30 years arXiv has played an essential role in the lives of physicists and other researchers around the world, making their research more open and accessible. APS and arXiv share a common mission to serve the global physics community, advance scientific discovery and research dissemination, and promote education broadly. Both organizations are strongly committed to open access and to sustainable open science initiatives,” said <a href="https://www.aps.org/publications/apsnews/updates/ceo.cfm">Jonathan Bagger, APS CEO</a>. “For these reasons, APS has been a leading supporter of arXiv across the past three decades (even before arXiv was arXiv). We have worked together to ensure arXiv’s uninterrupted service and stability, to integrate services and metadata, and to provide technical advice and other assistance. The new sustainability model enables APS to formalize and reaffirm our commitment. We are proud to be among the first Gold Affiliates, and look forward to continuing our collaboration over the coming decades.”</p>
<p>“arXiv exists thanks to the scientific community, and we are happy to announce the renewed support of professional societies, our partners in serving the scientific community,” said Eleonora Presani, executive director of arXiv. “We are grateful for their support.”</p>
<p>arXiv was founded strictly for research and education &#8212; not profit. That’s why we rely on the generosity of members, affiliates, sponsors, and other donors to support daily operations, critical infrastructure updates, and new initiatives.

Cognitive dysfunction in patients with CKD likely results from uremic neurotoxins interacting with neural progenitor cells, the brain vasculature, the lymphatic system, and monoaminergic neurons [<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41581-020-0266-9">1</a>].</p>
<p><a href="https://bmcnephrol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12882-021-02517-5">Månsson <em>et al.</em></a> set out to examine if having a GFR &lt; 60 mL/min/1.73m2 impacted cognitive development. They specifically looked at the development of dementia or mild cognitive impairment during a 6-year period. They also examined specific cognitive domains: learning and memory, language, complex attention, executive function, perceptual-motor, global cognitive function, and meta-memory. They found that processing speed, a subdomain of complex attention, was affected by kidney disease. There was no statistical significance in dementia or mild cognitive impairment associated with mild renal impairment (mean GFR was 74 mL/min/1.73m2).</p>
<p>Knowing that patients with kidney disease are at risk of cognitive impairment, what can I do to better serve this population as their physician? <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5414492/">We should provide this population</a> with support and resources including support groups and patient education with the potential to improve outcomes though there is not strong data yet to support this. Providing additional resources like social workers, counseling with pharmacists, and other therapies might prevent adverse outcomes in this group. After reading Månsson<em> et al.</em> article, I know I will work towards recognizing and accommodating mild cognitive impairment in my CKD clinic. I intend to change my practice by giving patients additional time to complete forms during the visit such as intake forms. I frequently provide patient education during a visit, such as low sodium diet, dialysis modalities, etc. This may be better served through going at a slower pace or incorporating a separate visit focused on CKD education instead of speeding through it in a 20-minute follow-up visit. I don’t always write down all of my treatment changes for the patient such as stop this medication or increase this medication, but I will now. I hope to provide written information that they can return to later by typing out my patient instructions more thoroughly or giving handouts on topics we discuss during our education. And finally, repetition is key to allow them to process it in their own time.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/barnacles-sea-turtle-shell-movement-cement">Barnacles are famed for not budging. But one species roams its sea turtle hosts</a></h4>

              
                <p>Barnacles aren’t exactly renowned for their athleticism, staying glued in place for much of their lives. But turtle-riding barnacles are fidgety travelers.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As adults, the turtle barnacles (<em>Chelonibia testudinaria</em>) can move about 1.4 millimeters a week across turtle shells, researchers report October 6 in <em>Proceedings of the Royal Society B. </em>Previous observations of barnacles stuck on green sea turtles <a href="http://www.seaturtle.org/mtn/archives/mtn119/mtn119p1.shtml?nocount">suggested that the creatures were somehow mobile</a>, propelled by either outside forces or their own actions. But this is the first experimental confirmation that they embark on self-directed treks.</p>



<p>Barnacles start life as free-swimming larvae, eventually settling and adhering to rocks, ship hulls or even the skin of <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/barnacles-track-whale-migration">marine mammals</a> (<em>SN: 9/27/16</em>). Some species have been known to rotate on their base or even scooch a smidge when nudged by a too-close neighbor. But once settled in, they live and grow, eating particles of food drifting by what was long considered their permanent address.</p>







<p>Now it turns out some may need forwarding addresses. Benny K.K. Chan, a marine ecologist at Academia Sinica in Taipei, Taiwan, decided to test <em>C. testudinaria</em>’s mobility experimentally when one of his students successfully transferred turtle barnacles from crabs to an acrylic plate. The team followed 15 transferred barnacles with time-series photography over a year.</p>



<p>Chan’s team also collaborated with researchers in Spain to track the movement of barnacles on the shells of five captive loggerhead sea turtles over a few months and with citizen scientist divers who gathered photos of wild green sea turtles in Taiwan. The team logged the positions &nbsp;of the green turtles’ barnacles over 16 weeks.</p>

<p>Turtle-riding barnacles moved as much as 54 millimeters — a little less than the length of an adult human’s thumb — during this time. Laboratory barnacles moved too, leaving trails of pale cement in layered, crescent-shaped patterns. “We were amazed,” says Chan.</p>



<p>How the barnacles move is still a mystery, but researchers think the crustaceans may partially dissolve their own cement and lift their soft base slightly off the surface. “Then the barnacle can secrete a new cement layer and probably surf on the cement,” says Chan.</p>



<p>The barnacles mostly traveled against the flow of any currents, showing that they weren’t just moving from the pressure of flowing water. They also didn’t get closer together, suggesting that the barnacles are seeking better locations to filter food out of the water rather than mating opportunities.&nbsp;</p>

Chan and Jr-Chi Lin</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>“This is rock-solid proof of something that is otherwise anecdotal,” says marine biologist Henrik Glenner at the University of Bergen in Norway , who was not involved with this study.</p>



<p>Barnacles typically exemplify biological competition for space and resources, because after settling they must compete in that spot for the rest of their lives, Glenner says. But being mobile upends this dynamic.</p>



<p>And it raises new questions. Glenner wonders if any barnacles in crowded, intertidal environments might also be capable of movement.&nbsp;And Tara Essock-Burns, a marine ecologist at the University of Hawaii at Manoa, wants to learn more about the cement itself and its flexible properties. “It is possible that turtle barnacle cement has a very different biochemistry than other barnacles that permanently adhere to [surfaces],” she says. This is precisely what Chan and his team plan on investigating next.</p>



<p>“There is a reason that Darwin was so captivated by barnacles,” says Essock-Burns. “They never cease to amaze us.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/earth-reflection-light-dim-earthshine-moon-solar-radiation">Earth is reflecting less light. It’s not clear if that’s a trend</a></h4>

              
                <p>The amount of sunlight that Earth reflects back into space — measured by the dim glow seen on the dark portions of a crescent moon’s face — has decreased measurably in recent years. Whether the decline in earthshine is a short-term blip or yet another ominous sign for Earth’s climate is up in the air, scientists suggest.</p>



<p>Our planet, on average, typically reflects about 30 percent of the sunlight that shines on it. But a new analysis bolsters previous studies suggesting that Earth’s reflectance has been declining in recent years, says Philip Goode, an astrophysicist at Big Bear Solar Observatory in California. From 1998 to 2017, <a href="https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1029/2021GL094888">Earth’s reflectance declined about 0.5 percent</a>, the team reported in the Sept. 8 <em>Geophysical Research Letters.</em></p>



<p>Using ground-based instruments at Big Bear, Goode and his colleagues measured earthshine — the light that reflects off our planet, to the moon and then back to Earth — from 1998 to 2017. Because earthshine is most easily gauged when the moon is a slim crescent and the weather is clear, the team collected a mere 801 data points during those 20 years, Goode and his colleagues report.</p>



<p>Much of the decrease in reflectance occurred during the last three years of the two-decade period the team studied, Goode says. Previous analyses of satellite data, he and his colleagues note, hint that the drop in reflectance stems from warmer temperatures along the Pacific coasts of North and South America, which in turn reduced low-altitude cloud cover and exposed the underlying, much darker and less reflective seas.</p>





<p>“Whether or not this is a long-term trend [in Earth’s reflectance] is yet to be seen,” says Edward Schwieterman, a planetary scientist at University of California, Riverside, who was not involved in the new analysis. “This strengthens the argument for collecting more data,” he says.</p>



<p>Decreased cloudiness over the eastern Pacific isn’t the only thing trimming Earth’s reflectance, or albedo, says Shiv Priyam Raghuraman, an atmospheric scientist at Princeton University. Many studies point to a long-term decline in sea ice (especially in the Arctic), ice on land, and tiny pollutants called aerosols — all of which scatter sunlight back into space to cool Earth.</p>



<p>With ice cover declining, Earth is absorbing more radiation. The extra radiation absorbed by Earth in recent decades goes toward warming the oceans and melting more ice, which can contribute to even more warming via a vicious feedback loop, says Schwieterman.</p>



<p>Altogether, Goode and his colleagues estimate, the decline in Earth’s reflectance from 1998 to 2017 means that each square meter of our planet’s surface is absorbing, on average, an extra 0.5 watts of energy. For comparison, the researchers note in their study, planet-warming greenhouse gases and other human activity over the same period boosted energy input to Earth’s surface by an estimated 0.6 watts of energy per square meter. That means the decline in Earth’s reflectance has, over that 20-year period, almost doubled the warming effect our planet experienced.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/jupiter-giant-planet-orbit-white-dwarf-star-solar-system-future">A Jupiter-like planet orbiting a white dwarf hints at our solar system’s future</a></h4>

              
                <p>A glimpse of our solar system’s future has appeared thousands of light-years away in the constellation Sagittarius. There a giant planet like Jupiter orbits a white dwarf, a dim, dense star that once resembled the sun.</p>



<p>In 2010, that star passed in front of a much more distant star. Like a magnifying glass, the white dwarf’s gravity bent the more distant star’s light rays so that they converged on Earth and made the distant star look hundreds of times brighter. A giant planet orbiting the white dwarf star also “microlensed” the distant star’s light, <a href="https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/0004-637X/754/1/73/meta">revealing the planet’s presence</a>.</p>



<p>In 2015, 2016 and again in 2018 astrophysicist Joshua Blackman of the University of Tasmania in Hobart, Australia and colleagues pointed the Keck II telescope in Hawaii at the far-off system, which lies some 5,000 to 8,000 light-years from Earth. The team was in search of the giant planet’s star, but saw, well, nothing.</p>



<p>“We expected that we’d see a star similar to the sun,” Blackman says. “And so we spent quite a few years trying to figure out why on Earth we didn’t see the star which we expected to see.”</p>





<p>After failing to detect any light from the spot where the planet’s star should be, Blackman’s team concluded that the object can’t be a typical star like the sun — also known as a main sequence star, which generates energy by converting hydrogen into helium at its center. Instead, the star must be something much fainter. The microlensing data indicate that the star is roughly half as massive as the sun, so the object isn’t massive enough to be a neutron star or black hole. But <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-021-03869-6">a white dwarf star fits the bill</a> perfectly, the researchers report online October 13 in <em>Nature</em>.</p>



<p>“They’ve carefully ruled out the other possible lens stars — neutron stars and black holes and main sequence stars and whatnot,” says Ben Zuckerman, an astronomer at UCLA, who was not involved with the work. He notes that only a handful of planets have ever been found orbiting white dwarfs.</p>



<p>The new planet is the first ever discovered that is orbiting a white dwarf and resembles Jupiter in both its mass and its distance from its star. Blackman’s team estimates that the planet is one to two times as massive as Jupiter and probably lies 2.5 to six times farther from the white dwarf star than Earth does from the sun. For comparison, Jupiter is 5.2 times farther out from the sun than Earth is. The white dwarf is somewhat larger than Earth, which means the planet is much bigger than its host star.</p>



<p>The white dwarf formed after a sunlike star expanded and became a red giant star. Then the red giant ejected its outer layers, exposing its hot core. That former core is the white dwarf star.</p>



<p>Our sun will turn into a white dwarf about <a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1993ApJ...418..457S/abstract">7.8 billion years from now</a>, so the new discovery is “a snapshot into the future of our solar system,” Blackman says. As the sun becomes a red giant, it will engulf and destroy its innermost planet, Mercury, and perhaps Venus too. But Mars, Jupiter and more distant planets should survive.</p>



<p>And Earth? No one yet knows what will happen to it.</p>

                <p>This week on Journal Club session Volker Steuber will talk about a paper &quot;A Cerebellar-Based Solution to the Nondeterministic Time Delay Problem in Robotic Control&quot;.</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>The presence of computation and transmission-variable time delays
within a robotic control loop is a major cause of instability,
hindering safe human-robot interaction (HRI) under these
circumstances. Classical control theory has been adapted to counteract
the presence of such variable delays; however, the solutions provided
to date cannot cope with HRI robotics inherent features. The highly
nonlinear dynamics of HRI cobots (robots intended for human
interaction in collaborative tasks), together with the growing use of
flexible joints and elastic materials providing passive compliance,
prevent traditional control solutions from being applied. Conversely,
human motor control natively deals with low power actuators, nonlinear
dynamics, and variable transmission time delays. The cerebellum,
pivotal to human motor control, is able to predict motor commands by
correlating current and past sensorimotor signals, and to ultimately
compensate for the existing sensorimotor human delay (tens of
milliseconds). This work aims at bridging those inherent features of
cerebellar motor control and current robotic challengestextemdash
namely, compliant control in the presence of variable sensorimotor
delays. We implement a cerebellar-like spiking neural network (SNN)
controller that is adaptive, compliant, and robust to variable
sensorimotor delays by replicating the cerebellar mechanisms that
embrace the presence of biological delays and allow motor learning and
adaptation.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/jaguars-brazil-wetland-huge-numbers-fish-hunt-play">Huge numbers of fish-eating jaguars prowl Brazil’s wetlands</a></h4>

              
                <p>In a tract of central Brazilian wetlands, jaguars spend their days wading through chest-deep waters searching for fish. When not hunting, the big cats playfully grapple with each other back on land. Their life is unlike any other known jaguar population’s existence in the world.</p>



<p>New findings reveal a degree of flexibility in diet and lifestyle <a href="https://esajournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ecy.3543">previously unseen among jaguars</a>. The discovery may provide key context on the cats’ role in food webs, helping scientists better understand the effect of environmental changes on the species, researchers report October 6 in <em>Ecology</em>. &nbsp;</p>



<p>Jaguars (<em>Panthera onca</em>), which are usually territorial loners that hunt on land, live in a wide array of habitats, ranging from North American deserts to grasslands and tropical rainforests in Central and South America. The cats are also found in the Pantanal, an immense tropical wetland — the largest of its kind in the world — that sprawls over parts of Brazil, Bolivia and Paraguay.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Ecologists Manoel dos Santos-Filho of the Universidade do Estado de Mato Grosso in Cáceres, Brazil, and Carlos Peres of the University of East Anglia in Norwich, England, knew of rumors of large numbers of jaguars sighted near Brazil’s Taiamã Ecological Station. That large ecological reserve is located in the remote, northern reaches of the Pantanal.</p>







<p>After relaying these anecdotes to Taal Levi, a wildlife ecologist at Oregon State University in Corvallis, the researchers started a project to better understand the jaguars’ biology and population status in the protected area.</p>



<p>Taiamã is seasonally flooded, with no roads or trails, so the team had to access the reserve by boat, setting up motion-activated cameras along waterways to gather data on jaguar numbers. The area’s abundance of jaguars, however, was obvious immediately.</p>



<p>“You set your foot out of the boat, and there’s a jaguar footprint there already,” says Charlotte Eriksson, a wildlife scientist also at Oregon State University. “There are scratches on trees. There are jaguar scats. There’s just an unbelievable presence of this apex predator wherever you go, which is something I’ve never experienced anywhere before.” </p>



<p>The team deployed 59 cameras, which operated from 2014 to 2018, and collected more than 1,500 videos of jaguars. The researchers also captured 13 jaguars and fitted them with GPS or radio-tracking collars to gain insight into the animals’ population density, movements and social interactions.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Based on their data, Eriksson and colleagues estimate that the Taiamã Ecological Station hosts the highest density of jaguars ever recorded: 12.4 animals per 100 square kilometers, nearly triple some of the next highest estimates elsewhere.&nbsp;Jaguars were also the most common mammal spotted on the cameras.</p>



<p>Video footage showed jaguars carrying off large fish. When the team analyzed 138 scat samples, the researchers found 46 percent had fish remains in them and 55 percent contained aquatic reptiles, such as caiman or turtles. Just 11 percent contained mammal remains.</p>

</div><figcaption>In Brazil’s Taiamã Ecological Station, jaguars (<em>Panthera onca</em>) were filmed fishing together in flooded wetlands, carrying off freshly caught fish and playing with each other on land. Elsewhere, the big cats are thought to be territorial loners that hunt mainly on land.</figcaption></figure>



<p>Jaguars are well-documented in taking on <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/blog/wild-things/jaguars-armored-prey-no-obstacle">challenging prey</a>, including underwater fare (<em>SN</em>: <em>7/15/16</em>). Eriksson and her team think that the Taiamã felines have not only the most fish-dependent diet among jaguars, but also among all big cats. There are tigers in Bangladesh that live in flooded mangrove forests and sometimes eat fish, but those cats still primarily eat land-based food, the researchers say.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The cameras and tracking collars also showed that the Taiamã jaguars were spending a lot of time near each other, sometimes traveling, fishing and playing together. This is all exceptionally odd behavior for jaguars, at least based on what scientists know about the cats elsewhere in the world.</p>



<p>In terms of social behavior, “what we knew of jaguars from before this study is basically that they are solitary, and they meet up to mate. And that’s about it,” Eriksson says, noting anecdotes of the cats sharing prey carcasses as rare counterexamples.&nbsp;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" width="1030" height="579" src="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/093021_JB_jaguar-fishing_inline-1030.jpg" alt="two jaguars lying on the shore" class="wp-image-3104573" srcset="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/093021_JB_jaguar-fishing_inline-1030.jpg 1030w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/093021_JB_jaguar-fishing_inline-1030-680x383.jpg 680w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/093021_JB_jaguar-fishing_inline-1030-800x450.jpg 800w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/093021_JB_jaguar-fishing_inline-1030-330x186.jpg 330w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/093021_JB_jaguar-fishing_inline-1030-768x432.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1030px) 100vw, 1030px" /><figcaption><span class="caption wp-caption-3104573">A pair of jaguars rest by the water in their wetland home. Within Brazil’s Taiamã Ecological Station, there are more jaguars per square kilometer than ever recorded anywhere else.</span><span class="credit wp-credit-3104573">Charlotte Eriksson, Daniel Kantek</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>The profusion of aquatic prey in the flooded preserve — protected from human encroachment — may be responsible for the jaguars’ superlative density and their rich social lives. It’s possible there’s so much food available, Eriksson says, that there is “no real need to fight over it.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Another idea is that aquatic prey concentrated along the river margins are accessible in only certain areas, Levi says. This may encourage jaguar territories to dissolve, since obtaining access to multiple fishing spots requires getting along with other jaguars. Other animals behave in similar ways. Brown bears, for example, congregate in great numbers to feed at salmon spawning grounds, despite the bears’ typically solitary nature, Levi says.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The abundance of jaguars and their social behavior is not surprising, given the available food resources, says Todd Fuller, a conservation biologist at the University of Massachusetts Amherst. Still, he finds the new information exciting.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Fuller, who was not involved with the research, says the study helps bring researchers’ understanding of jaguars’ ecology and conservation closer to what’s known about most other large cat species, and “that is a very good thing.”</p>



<p>Jaguars in the Pantanal face many threats and are declining within Brazil, Eriksson says, suffering from drought, fire and agricultural expansion. Evaluating how jaguars might respond to such changes is paramount. In 2020,&nbsp;half of the study area burned, so Eriksson is currently assessing the impact of the fires on the jaguars and their periodically submerged home.&nbsp;</p>



<p>She also wants to investigate how the Taiamã jaguars’ taste for fish is affecting how often the animals eat land-living prey and what strategies the cats use to catch fish.</p>



<p>“We think we know a lot about these charismatic, large predators,” she says, “but there are still things to learn.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2021/10/13/scared-of-spiders-theres-an-app-for-that/">Scared Of Spiders? There’s An App For That</a></h4>

              
                <p><em>By </em><a href="https://twitter.com/E_Barratt">Emma L. Barratt</a></p>



<p>Specific phobias are incredibly common. According to estimates, around 3‒15% of people will develop one in their lifetime, the majority of whom won’t seek treatment. Phobias can manifest around a huge number of stimuli, such as lightning, dentists, and — most commonly — animals such as spiders.</p>



<p>Although exposure therapy is well established and is very effective at reducing fear and anxiety in those with specific phobias, not many end up accessing treatment. Unsurprisingly, the certainty of being exposed to terrifying things doesn’t entice many people. Even those who do make it into a therapeutic setting are also quite likely to drop out due to the extreme fear caused by these controlled exposures.</p>



<p>However, modern technology may help us to sidestep these issues entirely. Anja Zimmer and team at the University of Basel and Saarland University believe that <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S088761852100089X?via%3Dihub">the solution may lie in augmented reality</a>.</p>



<span id="more-44083"></span>



<p>Though exposure therapy using virtual reality (VR) technology has been shown by several studies over the last decade to be effective and well tolerated, its rollout has been somewhat underwhelming. Practically speaking, many clinicians cite concerns about motion sickness, costs, or trouble using the hardware. This means that, although VR headsets are now relatively accessible, only the minority of clinicians have chosen to offer this approach as an option.</p>



<p>Augmented reality (AR) is a close relative of VR. Instead of donning a bulky headset, users are able to open their phone cameras and view on-screen virtual objects overlaid on their surroundings in real time. Not only is programming AR experiences much less time intensive (and therefore more cost effective) than doing so in VR, but users are also able to see their own bodies through the camera lens, creating a greater level of engagement with the virtual objects.</p>



<p>These qualities make it a potentially good choice for a new method of delivering exposure therapy. So, in order to test the efficacy of exposure therapy administered via AR, the team designed <em>Phobys</em>, a smartphone based AR app designed to reduce fear of spiders.</p>



<p>Over the course of six 30-minute sessions administered within two weeks, users are able to work through nine short levels of virtual spider exposure. These involve tasks such as looking at the virtual spider, approaching and &#8220;collecting&#8221; them (like in a video game), superimposing spiders onto their hand, and even walking through groups of spiders. After each level, users give a rating of how fearful and disgusted they felt on a scale of 0 to 10; once a rating of 4 is achieved, they can advance to the next level. Perhaps most endearingly, if users get close enough to a spider in the ninth and final level, a kiss sound is triggered and hearts float across the screen. Gamification elements such as this are widely recognised to improve uptake, and are used throughout the levels.</p>



<p>In this study, published in the <em>Journal of Anxiety Disorders</em>, 33 participants (18 diagnosed with arachnophobia) used the <em>Phobys </em>app as recommended. Before and after using the app, they provided responses to several measures of fear: subjective fear ratings when approaching a real spider (a Behavioural Approach Test), the Fear of Spiders Questionnaire (FSQ), and the Spider Phobia Beliefs Questionnaire (SBQ), as well as a measure of disgust. They were also asked to rate how much they felt that their fears had reduced, post-intervention. A further 33 (17 diagnosed with arachnophobia) participants received no intervention, in order to provide control data.</p>



<p>Analyses of these measures revealed that use of <em>Phobys</em> led to significantly lower subjective levels of fear when approaching real spiders, when compared to controls. Those who had used the AR app were also able to progress further in a Behavioural Approach Test with spiders than those who had received no intervention. The story was similar across all measures — app users subjectively felt less disgusted, scored lower on the FSQ and SBQ, and estimated higher levels of fear reduction than those assigned to the control group.</p>



<p>Since this intervention was completed at home, there were varying levels of uptake. The majority of participants did more than one session (lasting 30 minutes), though some used it for upwards of two hours. Data analysis showed that after an average of only 90 minutes of training with the app, clinically significant improvements in fear were seen — however, the authors note that due to the design of this study, they can’t rule out a contribution from placebo to this effect. That is, users might have expected an improvement from using the app, so they got a short-term boost from using it that’s not necessarily reflective of long-term fear reduction.</p>



<p>Improvements in fear and disgust were seen regardless of whether or not participants crossed the DSM-5 threshold for a specific phobia, meaning that an AR approach may be suitable for all levels of spider fear requiring exposure therapy. Whether AR exposure will work for other types of specific phobia, though, is still somewhat unclear. For example, while spiders can neatly and convincingly be superimposed into environments, larger animals, or even more elaborate experiences such as dental visits, may be tricky to condense into such a small and neat format. Further explorations of whether users are more comfortable with fear stimuli in the long term are also needed. Even so, this study indicates new and highly accessible avenues for exposure therapy.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/nostalgia-mental-health-benefits-hard-times-pandemic">Nostalgia may have bona fide benefits in hard times, like the pandemic</a></h4>

              
                <p>Over 300 years ago, Swiss physician Johannes Hofer observed disturbing behaviors among Swiss mercenaries fighting in far-flung lands. The soldiers were prone to anorexia, despondency and bouts of weeping. Many attempted suicide. Hofer determined that the mercenaries suffered from what he called “nostalgia,” which he concluded was “a cerebral disease of essentially demonic cause.”</p>



<p>Nowadays, nostalgia’s reputation is much improved. Social psychologists define the emotion — which Hofer saw as synonymous with “homesickness” — as a sentimental longing for meaningful events from one’s past. And research suggests that <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/music-therapy-alzheimers-disease-dementia-patients-memory">nostalgia can help people cope</a> with <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30149444/">dementia</a>, <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/02699931.2020.1825339?journalCode=pcem20">grief</a> and even the <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0022022120988345">disorientation</a> experienced by immigrants and refugees (<em>SN: 3/1/21</em>).</p>



<p>Nostalgia may even help people cope with the COVID-19 pandemic. In a study published September 8 in <em>Social, Psychological and Personality Science</em>, researchers found when some lonely, unhappy people reminisced about better, pre-pandemic moments, they felt happier. The results suggest that nostalgia can serve as an <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/19485506211041830">antidote to loneliness</a> during the pandemic, the researchers conclude.</p>



<p>“A good analogy is the immune system,” says social psychologist Tim Wildschut of the University of Southampton in England. “A viral infection may make you ill, but it also activates your immune system and your immune system makes you better. Loneliness reduces happiness but also triggers nostalgia, and nostalgia increases happiness.”</p>





<p>In the new study, Wildschut and colleagues first surveyed over 3,700 participants in the United States, United Kingdom and China to assess people’s levels of loneliness, nostalgia and happiness during the early days of the pandemic. Surveys varied slightly by country, but for most questions or statements, participants responded on a scale from 1 to 7, with 1 for “not at all” and 7 for “very much.” For instance, participants in the United States rated how isolated they felt from the rest of the world in the week prior to the survey, how happy they felt compared with their peers and their overall feelings of nostalgia.</p>



<p>The researchers found that across the three countries, people who scored relatively high in loneliness also, not surprisingly, scored lower in happiness. But when the team drilled down on the role nostalgia plays, they found people who didn’t indulge in those memories were the least happy.</p>



<p>“Loneliness [triggers] unhappiness and nostalgia. Then unhappiness and nostalgia fight with each other,” says coauthor Constantine Sedikides, a social psychologist also at the University of Southampton.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, in three experiments with new sets of U.S. participants, the researchers manipulated people’s nostalgia levels, using the spring 2020 lockdown as a proxy for heightened loneliness. For example, in one experiment conducted in April 2020, the researchers recruited just over 200 online participants. The team induced nostalgia in half the participants by having them write four words describing a specific nostalgic event from their past. Participants were then prompted to write freely for three minutes about how that past experience made them feel. People in the control group completed the same tasks but about ordinary past experiences. &nbsp;</p>



<p>Those experiments revealed that, compared with the control group, participants in the nostalgia group reported slight but statistically significant higher happiness levels, as measured by the same 1-7 scale used in the earlier surveys. For instance, in the experiment with the 200-plus participants, the researchers found that happiness scores in the nostalgia group averaged 5.64 compared with 5.3 in the control group. Statistical analysis suggests that nostalgia can explain about 2 percent of the variation in happiness, the researchers say.</p>



<p>Those results may sound trivial, but even small variations can yield large results when viewed across large populations or across time, says personality psychologist Friedrich Götz of the University of British Columbia in Vancouver.</p>



<p>“Let’s say you are a happy person every day of your life. Chances are you will have a more fulfilled life than if you are a less happy person,” Götz says. “So 2 percent can make a difference because our happiness influences how we act, feel and think every day of our lives.”</p>

<h3>Nostalgia booster</h3>



<p>Early in the pandemic, researchers tested the impact of nostalgia on happiness. Volunteers were asked to call up a special memory and spend three minutes writing about it. When asked to rate their happiness on a scale of 1 to 7, this group scored slightly higher than volunteers in the control group who were asked to think about an ordinary memory (Time 1). A day or two after the original experiment, researchers asked participants in the nostalgia group to think about their memory again. That “nostalgia booster” once again prompted higher happiness scores (Time 2).</p>

<p>The hope that nostalgia-induced happiness could build up over time underpins some researchers’ long-term goal of harnessing and deploying techniques to trigger nostalgic memories as a form of therapy. Nostalgia can connect people to their past, present and even desired future selves, these researchers say. And since many nostalgic memories often involve other people, they can also help people feel linked to a wider community.</p>



<p>In one study, for example, existential psychologist Clay Routledge and colleagues tapped nostalgia’s social side. Participants first completed an established “nostalgia inventory,” where they rated on a scale from 1 to 5 how nostalgic they felt about 20 aspects of their past lives, such as family and vacations. The researchers then asked people about the types of studies that they might want to participate in later on. Two of those potential studies involved meeting other participants while two others did not. &nbsp;</p>



<p>Participants reporting high levels of nostalgia, especially those nostalgic for social experiences, were more likely than other participants to select the studies that involved <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26479361/">meeting new people</a>, the researchers reported in the December 2015 <em>Journal of Personality and Social Psychology</em>. That suggests that proneness to remembering meaningful past social experiences engenders future social experiences, the team says.</p>



<p>“Nostalgia isn’t just people remembering time with loved ones,” says Routledge, of North Dakota State University in Fargo. “It’s orienting them toward building new social experiences.”</p>



<p>A key question, though, is if nostalgia’s benefits can persist beyond that fleeting moment of remembrance. Wildschut’s team found that nostalgia’s benefits, in terms of happiness, faded after just a day or two. But nostalgia-induced happiness persisted for a couple days when the researchers reminded people to think about that special memory.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Crucially, nostalgia therapy may not be for everyone. Researchers reported in October 2019 in <em>Personality and Individual Differences</em> that invoking nostalgia in individuals who viewed relationships as a source of comfort and security <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0191886919303885?via%3Dihub">increased those people’s intention to engage with others</a>. The reverse, however, held true for individuals who saw relationships as a source of pain.</p>



<p>“For these types of avoidant people … nostalgia pushed them in the opposite direction. They were even less likely to want to connect with others on a deeper level,” says existential and social psychologist Andrew Abeyta of Rutgers University–Camden in New Jersey.</p>





<p>Wildschut and colleagues found a similar result when investigating whether invoking nostalgia among Syrian refugees living in Saudi Arabia could increase self-esteem, sense of meaning in life, feelings of social belonging and optimism.</p>



<p>In that study, refugees in an experimental group wrote about meaningful events from their past, while refugees in a control group wrote about ordinary events. The experiment showed that triggering nostalgia in refugees high in resilience — a trait defined by a capacity to withstand and recover from adversity — resulted in more positive emotions than those reported by resilient refugees in a control group, the team concluded in the December 2019 <em>European Journal of Social Psychology</em>. But while inducing nostalgia in refugees low in resilience did help them feel a greater sense of continuity in life and more socially connected compared with a low-resilience control group, nostalgic memories also made them feel <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ejsp.2590">less optimistic</a> about the future.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“When you push the test of nostalgia to those extremes, it’s a very, very tough test,” Wildschut says.</p>



<p>Caveats aside, Wildschut remains optimistic about developing some form of nostalgia therapy. He recalls a conversation with his young daughter many years ago. When he asked her how long nostalgia lasts, she replied “forever,” Wildschut says. “What she meant is that the memory is there, and you can recall it any time.” Ultimately, he and other nostalgia researchers hope to one day identify suitable candidates for nostalgia therapy and then train those people to recall special memories whenever they feel blue.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/fastest-spinning-white-dwarf-star-rotation-speed">The fastest-spinning white dwarf ever seen rotates once every 25 seconds</a></h4>

              
                <p>The sun turns once a month and the Earth once a day, but a white dwarf star 2,000 light-years away spins every 25 seconds, beating the old champ by five seconds. That makes it the fastest-spinning star of any sort ever seen — unless you consider such exotic objects as <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/dance-dead">neutron stars</a> and black holes, some of which spin even faster, to be stars (<em>SN: 3/13/07</em>). &nbsp;</p>



<p>About as small as Earth but roughly as massive as the sun, a white dwarf is extremely dense. The star’s surface gravity is so great that if you dropped a pebble from a height of a few feet, it would smash into the surface at thousands of miles per hour. The typical white dwarf takes hours or days to spin.</p>



<p>The fast-spinning white dwarf, named LAMOST J0240+1952&nbsp;and located in the constellation Aries, got in a whirl because of its ongoing affair with a red dwarf star that revolves around it. Just as falling water makes a waterwheel turn, so gas falling from the red companion star made the white dwarf twirl.</p>



<p>The discovery occurred the night of August 7, when astronomer Ingrid Pelisoli of the University of Warwick in Coventry, England, and her colleagues detected a periodic blip of light from the dim duo. The blip <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2108.11396">repeated every 24.93 seconds</a>, revealing the white dwarf star’s record-breaking rotation period, the researchers report August 26 at arXiv.org.</p>



<p>The star’s only known rival is an even faster-spinning object in orbit with the blue star HD 49798. But that rapid rotator’s nature is unclear, with some recent studies saying it is likely a neutron star, not a white dwarf.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2021/10/12/a-jekyll-and-hyde-emotion-research-on-anger-digested/">A Jekyll And Hyde Emotion? Research On Anger, Digested</a></h4>

              
                <p><em>By</em> <a href="https://emmayoung.net/">Emma Young</a></p>



<p>At times, it feels that the world is awash with anger.  From the streets of Taliban-controlled Afghanistan to any form of social media you’d care to mention, anger and outrage are seemingly everywhere. New research helps to reveal why this is. It also reveals anger to be itself a Jekyll and Hyde emotion — if we can rid ourselves of the dark, destructive side, what is left can act as a force for good. </p>



<span id="more-44070"></span>



<p><strong>Anger sells</strong></p>



<p>Why is anger everywhere? One reason is that it &#8220;sells&#8221;.&nbsp; There’s plenty of evidence that if you want to go viral online, lacing a <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2021/07/28/social-media-posts-that-are-hostile-towards-political-opponents-get-more-shares/">social media post with negative emotions — like anger — is the way to go</a>. Social media posts that stir anger against political opponents get more views, and fake news that triggers anger or anxiety is more likely to be spread than real news. In fact, according to the China-based authors of that fake news research (which is <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2004.10399.pdf">available as a preprint</a>): “The easier contagion of fake news online can be causally explained by the greater anger it carries.”</p>



<p><strong>People are tired</strong></p>



<p>Poor sleep is common — about a quarter of British adults report suffering from insomnia — and this makes us angrier. As anger can itself worsen sleep, whether sleep disruption also hiked anger was unclear until recently. In 2018, though, <a href="https://doi.apa.org/doiLanding?doi=10.1037/xge0000522">a US team reported the results of a study</a> exploring the potential impact of a 2-4 hours per night reduction in a person’s normal sleep time over two nights. The team brought this group plus another group of people who had followed their regular sleep routine (averaging about seven hours a night) into the lab. They were subjected to various irritations, like the harsh white noise sound of static. As a group, the sleep-restricted individuals became “substantially” angrier.</p>



<p>There’s evidence of dangers for younger people, too. <a href="https://academic.oup.com/sleep/article-abstract/44/5/zsaa253/6007670?redirectedFrom=fulltext">An Australian study of healthy teenagers</a> found that when their night-time sleep was restricted to five hours a night for five nights, this increased anger, confusion and symptoms of depression, and sapped their energy. Even more surprising, perhaps, was that two 10-hour &#8220;recovery nights&#8221; were not enough to reverse these negative changes. &#8220;Given the prevalence of insufficient sleep and the rising incidence of mood disorders and dysregulation in adolescents, our findings highlight the importance of sufficient sleep to mitigate these risks,” <a href="https://www.eurekalert.org/news-releases/590588">commented researcher Michelle Short</a>.</p>



<p><strong>Triggered</strong></p>



<p>Other everyday experiences hike anger. &#8220;Hanger&#8221; — a term that combines &#8220;hunger&#8221; and &#8220;anger&#8221; — is a well-documented phenomenon. Exactly what accounts for it has been less clear, however. In fact, it doesn’t seem to be triggered by a simple drop in blood sugar levels, according to <a href="https://www.apa.org/pubs/journals/releases/emo-emo0000422.pdf">a 2019 study in <em>Emotion</em></a>. Jennifer MacCormack at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill and colleagues found that hunger was indeed linked to more negative emotions, including anger, which caused some participants to judge another person more harshly. However, their analysis suggested that this only happens when a person fails to realise that hunger is making them feel bad, and instead mistakenly puts the blame for those negative feelings on something else — like another person’s behaviour. This could make them lash out, instead of fixing the problem by finding something to eat. The team advises paying attention to signals from your body, and, if you’re feeling irritated, mentally checking whether this might be down to hunger. This, they argue, could help with everything from day-to-day social situations to long term mental health.</p>



<p>Some people have more unlikely anger triggers, however. For some, the sound of chewing, slurping, nail clipping or breathing can be enough to send them into an explosive rage. These people suffer from &#8220;misophonia&#8221;, and <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2021/08/17/excessive-mirroring-could-explain-why-people-with-misophonia-react-strongly-to-sounds-of-chewing-or-drinking/">in 2021 a study in the <em>Journal of Neuroscience</em></a> provided a fascinating explanation: misophonia isn’t caused by <em>hearing</em> a specific &#8220;trigger sound&#8221; so much as&nbsp; an “over-mirroring” of the other person’s physical actions — and as this over-mirroring is an unpleasant experience, it causes the anger. This insight opens up important potential routes to treatment. Given that misophonia can destroy relationships and even lead to suicide, these are badly needed.</p>



<p><strong>Harmful for health</strong></p>



<p>Too much anger is bad for you, as well as others. <a href="https://www.aan.com/PressRoom/home/PressRelease/239">Strokes</a> and heart attacks have both been linked to anger outbursts occurring during the preceding few hours. But in raising body-wide inflammation, regular feelings of anger may also hike the risk of chronic diseases, including heart disease, arthritis and cancer, according to <a href="https://www.apa.org/pubs/journals/releases/pag-pag0000348.pdf">research published in <em>Psychology and Aging</em> in 2019.</a> In fact, anger could be more harmful to older people’s physical health than sadness, according to the team, led by Meaghan A. Barlow at Concordia University, US. The researchers found that, among participants aged 80 or older, at least, those who reported experiencing anger daily had both higher levels of inflammation and more chronic illness. Of course, chronic illness could easily disrupt sleep, which, as we know, increases anger, but this is certainly not the first study to link anger (and the stress hormone cortisol, which is raised during anger) to increased general inflammation. However, anger is not all bad….</p>



<p><strong>The upsides</strong></p>



<p>There are definite upsides to anger. If something in your life or in society is wrong, anger can signal to others that you <em>feel</em> wronged; expressions of anger can be a sign of <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2021/08/27/we-think-anger-is-a-sign-of-guilt-but-it-may-actually-be-a-better-sign-of-innocence/">innocence in the face of a false accusation</a>, for instance. Anger can also push you into <em>doing</em> something to try to set things right. A <a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/doiLanding?doi=10.1037/emo0000906">2020 study</a> in <em>Emotion </em>provided experimental evidence for this idea. The researchers staged the embezzlement of project funds from a lab. They found that the level of anger felt by a witness to this predicted whether or not they intervened to try to stop it. This study provided evidence of “the important role of anger in the psychological process underlying moral courage,” the team wrote. Of course, a person’s individual moral framework is crucial here, though. If the sight of women venturing outdoors alone or going to work, say, deeply offends you, then your resulting outrage will likely propel you to action, too.</p>



<p>Expressing anger can also make you seem more authentic and sincere. At least, this was suggested by a <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0883902621000197?via=ihub">2021 study</a> of Kickstarter pitch videos. Entrepreneurs are often encouraged to be only positive about their ventures, commented the researchers. But they found that those who expressed anger and fear as well as happiness had more fundraising success than those who conveyed only happiness. An angry expression can convey how much you care about something, the team explained. If you don’t actually feel angry, you could always fake it, though; I can’t refer to angry &#8220;expressions&#8221; without noting <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2018/05/02/a-radical-new-theory-proposes-that-facial-expressions-are-not-emotional-displays-but-tools-for-social-influence/">the compelling theory that facial displays are not emotional expressions but &#8220;tools for social influence&#8221;</a>. However, circumstances can affect our perceptions of anger in others…</p>



<p><strong>Anger and bias</strong></p>



<p>We can misperceive anger. In fact, student teachers in the US are more likely to misperceive Black children as angry than White children, according to a <a href="https://doi.apa.org/doiLanding?doi=10.1037/emo0000756">2020 paper </a>in <em>Emotion</em>. The 178 prospective teachers in this study watched brief video clips of children aged 9-13 showing happiness, sadness, anger, fear or disgust (as these emotions are conventionally considered to be &#8220;expressed&#8221;). Overall, boys were more likely to be misperceived as angry — rather than afraid, say — than girls. But Black boys and girls were more likely to be misperceived as angry than White children, and Black boys were misperceived most of all. This bias could help to perpetuate racial differences in educational success, argues the team, led by Amy G. Halberstadt at North Caroline State University. The following year, Halberstadt and colleagues published another paper, finding <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2021/09/06/people-are-more-likely-to-misread-a-black-child-as-angry-when-they-believe-the-child-is-older/">that the older adults believe Black children to be, the more likely they are to (incorrectly) judge them to be angry, too.</a> Perhaps educating student teachers about this bias will help them to avoid it — only future research will tell.</p>



<p>Misperceiving anger is clearly a danger not just for pupil-teacher relationships but all kinds of everyday interactions. But it’s not as though there isn’t much genuine anger in the world to accurately perceive… To twist the title of one of Richard Curtis’s best-known movies, anger actually is all around — but the better we understand it, the more we can channel its positive aspects and take steps to ensure that it helps rather than harms us.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/nobel-prize-economics-2021-natural-experiments">Methods of getting results from real-world experiments win 2021 economics Nobel</a></h4>

              
                <p>Some of the most insightful — and now most celebrated — studies of such major social issues as minimum wages and immigration have seized on naturally occurring events. Pioneering efforts by three economists to study <a href="https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/economic-sciences/2021/press-release/">the effects of real-life economic events that mimic controlled laboratory investigations</a> have won the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences.</p>



<p>David Card of the University of California, Berkeley will receive half of the prize of 10 million Swedish kronor (or half of about $1.14 million). The other half will be split by Joshua Angrist of MIT and Guido Imbens of Stanford University. The Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences announced the prize October 11.</p>



<p>Research by the Nobel Prize winners was instrumental in the development during the 1990s of what are known as natural experiments. These investigations rely on naturally occurring differences between groups or populations that either do or don’t experience specific conditions. In this way, social scientists can study, say, how differences in income affect physical health or how immigration influences employment rates.</p>



<p>Natural experiments are especially important because investigators of key social questions, such as whether pollution slows children’s mental development or whether strong public institutions promote economic growth, often can’t assign people at random to treatment and control conditions. It would be unethical, impractical or both.</p>





<p>“The Nobel winners developed techniques that replicate the idea of truly scientific experiments like you would use to test a vaccine, except [the experiments] occurred in the real world,” says economist Phillip Levine of Wellesley College in Massachusetts. These methods “were at the forefront of a ‘credibility revolution’ in economics” that made the field relevant and understandable to the public, he adds.&nbsp; Levine was a Princeton University graduate student with Angrist, and Card was his thesis adviser.</p>



<p>Natural experiments in economics are related to another influential line of research that examines <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/economics-nobel-prize-poverty-science">ways to counteract poverty’s harmful effects using field experiments</a>, work that won the 2019 economics Nobel (<em>SN: 10/14/19</em>).</p>



<p>In a key 1994 paper, Card and the late Princeton economist Alan Krueger <a href="https://econpapers.repec.org/article/aeaaecrev/v_3a84_3ay_3a1994_3ai_3a4_3ap_3a772-93.htm">challenged conventional wisdom in economics</a> that increases in the minimum wage reduce employment. Card and Krueger surveyed fast-food restaurants in New Jersey and a neighboring section of eastern Pennsylvania before and after a minimum wage hike that was instituted only in the Garden State. Full-time employment slightly increased in New Jersey following wage increases, while it declined in Pennsylvania where wages stayed the same.</p>

<p>Further research addressed the complexities of how the minimum wage interacts with employment rates, but it was clear after Card and Krueger’s report that a simple cause-and-effect relationship didn’t exist.</p>



<p>Card also conducted a natural experiment indicating that a huge influx of Cuban refugees to Miami in 1980 did not result in reduced wages and employment for Miami residents with low education levels. That work led Card and others to further explore how new immigration influences the economic standing of native-born citizens and earlier immigrants.</p>



<p>Angrist and Imbens expanded on such work by devising steps to determine under what conditions a natural experiment, such as being given an opportunity to leave school at age 16, affects later outcomes, such as annual income. For instance, the researchers’ method estimated the effect on later income of an additional year of education, which they put at about 9 percent lower for each year lost after age 16, but only for people who chose to leave school early. The estimate excluded earnings histories of individuals who had planned to go to college all along because those people never considered leaving school early.</p>

<p>Card, Angrist and Imbens “have promoted a type of scholarly investigation that is of practical use outside academic journals,” says economist Melissa Kearney of the University of Maryland in College Park, who has studied and worked with both Card and Angrist. The Nobel Prize winners’ research equipped social scientists with “tools to credibly draw causal conclusions about empirical relationships.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/earliest-evidence-tobacco-use-smoking-pipe-burned-seeds-plants">The earliest evidence of tobacco use dates to over 12,000 years ago</a></h4>

              
                <p>Ancient North Americans started using tobacco around 12,500 to 12,000 years ago, roughly 9,000 years before <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352409X18301664">the oldest indications that they smoked the plant in pipes</a>, a new study finds.</p>



<p>This discovery replaces the pipe-smoking report as the oldest direct evidence for the human use of tobacco anywhere in the world.</p>



<p>Excavations at the Wishbone site in Utah’s Great Salt Lake Desert <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41562-021-01202-9">uncovered four charred seeds of wild tobacco plants</a> in a small fireplace, say archaeologist Daron Duke of Far Western Anthropological Research Group in Henderson, Nev., and colleagues.</p>



<p>Those seeds, three of which the scientists radiocarbon dated, likely came from plants gathered on foothills or mountains located 13 kilometers or more from the Wishbone area, Duke’s team reports October 11 in <em>Nature Human Behavior</em>.</p>





<p>The site was located in a sprawling marshland at the time of its occupation. Finds in and around the fireplace include bones of ducks and other waterfowl, a long, intact stone point and another point broken in two, a bone implement and seeds of several edible wetland plants.</p>



<p>It’s unclear how ancient North American hunter-gatherers used the tobacco, Duke says. Wads of tobacco leaves, stems and other plant fibers may have been twisted into balls and chewed or sucked, with attached seeds spit out or discarded. Ancestors of Pueblo people in what’s now Arizona <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1179/2042458214Y.0000000006?journalCode=yjfa20">chewed wild tobacco</a> between around 1,000 and 2,000 years ago. Tobacco smoking can’t be ruled out at the Wishbone site, Duke adds.</p>



<p>The earliest evidence of domesticated tobacco, which comes from South America, dates to <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/people-pacific-northwest-smoked-tobacco-long-europeans-showed">only about 8,000 years ago</a> (<em>SN: 10/29/18</em>). Duke suspects various ancient American populations independently tamed the plant at different times. “Certain groups wound up domesticating particular [tobacco] species, typically alongside food crops,” he suggests.</p>

                <p><em>By </em><a href="https://twitter.com/E_Barratt">Emma L. Barratt</a></p>



<p>We’re all aware of the financial disparity that plagues our economic systems. Many of those at the top of large corporations seem content to exploit large groups of people for their own significant financial gain.</p>



<p>Strangely, this is somewhat at odds with previous research in behavioural economics, which tends to find that people are generally quite prosocial, honest, and overall unwilling to steal considerable amounts from others. From results like these, it’s difficult to piece together exactly how we’ve arrived at such levels of financial inequality.</p>



<p>Psychologists have floated a number of potential explanations for this phenomenon. Perhaps those who end up rich have innately higher levels of psychopathy, for example. Or perhaps it’s the case that the cultural norms within certain businesses change the way people make economic decisions. However, <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41562-021-01170-0">new research</a> in <em>Nature Human Behaviour</em> from Carlos Alós-Ferrer and colleagues suggests an alternative explanation: when it comes to acting selfishly, we are much more likely to do it at a grand scale than a small one.</p>



<span id="more-44066"></span>



<p>Previous tasks that seek to measure selfishness, such as the Dictator, Ultimatum, and Trust games, all probe how much of a sum a participant will transfer to another person under slightly different conditions and opportunities for personal gain. Responses to such tasks are generally pro-social, with participants often being generous to the other party, and mostly keen to trust them, despite risks to their own gains. But, though these results are generally consistent across previous literature, they don’t resemble the sort of behaviour we see day to day from those with the opportunity to exploit large groups of people.</p>



<p>In order to investigate this mismatch, the research team at the University of Zurich decided to look at how acting upon a larger group of &#8220;victims&#8221; influences a robber’s willingness to be selfish, using a new task called the Big Robber game.</p>



<p>During this game, participants are assigned the role of &#8220;robber&#8221; or &#8220;victim&#8221;. Robbers are asked to choose what portion of the victims’ earnings they wished to take from a group of 16 victims: 0%, 10%, 33%, or 50%.</p>



<p>This new task was administered to 640 student participants alongside Dictator, Ultimatum, and Trust games, where each participant played rounds as both sender and receiver.</p>



<p>After participants had made all of their transactional choices in these tasks, they were presented with the option to donate a freely specified percentage of their earnings to charity. The authors hoped that uptake of this opportunity would be indicative of the emotions participants felt after making their choices. If they felt guilty about their actions, they may choose to give away a higher percentage of their earnings, while lower donations may be indicative of selfishness and a lack of regret.</p>



<p>Analyses showed that the majority of robbers chose to steal from victims. Around 56% decided to take half of victims’ earnings for themselves, and a further 27% chose to take a third of victim’s earnings. Just under 15% elected to take a tenth of the amount, and a staggeringly low 2% declined to steal anything.</p>



<p>A closer look at the time taken to reach these decisions showed that those taking half of victims’ earnings were faster to arrive at their choice than those taking a more moderate third of earnings. Decision times formed an inverse U-shape, suggesting that those choosing extreme decisions may have faced less of a moral struggle than more moderate robbers. Those who robbed half of victims’ earnings also donated less in absolute terms than those who robbed a third. This, the authors believe, is indicative of a lack of guilt about their decision.</p>



<p>This is in stark contrast to the Dictator, Ultimatum and Trust games, during which these same participants were mostly generous and cooperative with the lone other party in the transaction. In all games, the majority of participants who had been robbers declined to take the options that would harm the receiver’s earnings the most, despite it being more profitable to them personally.</p>



<p>Taken together, these results indicate that harming many individuals seems to be easier for us to do than harming just one. The authors suggest that we mentally make a trade-off between our own personal gain and concern for others. If we take a small percentage of earnings from a large group, we’re able to make large financial gains while minimally affecting each individual member of said group. But, if we were to reduce this to a one-on-one transaction, we would have to take magnitudes more of the other party’s earnings to achieve the same profit. This is far more uncomfortable, psychologically speaking, than exploiting the earnings of larger groups, which may explain why we routinely see such behaviour from those at the top of larger organisations.</p>



<p>Future research could investigate whether this effect holds in other demographics, across different cultures, or indeed in less trying economic circumstances than we’ve experienced recently. Explorations of individual differences, such as personality, profession, or financial status, may help further tease apart the factors dictating willingness to steal large amounts during this game. This research represents a timely look at willingness to exploit a large group for personal gain, which may become increasingly relevant in years to come.</p>

<p>Sedimentation of seawater, coupled with elusive behaviour, can make it difficult for ecologists to monitor threatened or elusive species. However, with the development of new molecular technologies, researchers can find more than the eye can see using DNA found within environmental samples.</p>
<p>In a recent study published in <em>BMC Ecology and Evolution</em>, Ip and colleagues applied environmental DNA (eDNA) technology on seawater to detect shark and ray species in sedimented urban reef environments off Singapore. Historic reports documented a much higher diversity of shark and ray species compared to recent sightings. Therefore, the researchers asked whether local extinction of species had occurred or whether they have become too rare to be detected by traditional visual survey methods. Using eDNA from seawater, the researchers detected twice the number shark and ray species living off the coast of Singapore compared to those typically sighted within the last 20 years and were excited to discover two potentially new species.</p>
<p>In the face of global change, greater knowledge of the planet&#8217;s past and present ecosystems is more important than ever to manage biodiversity loss and set conservation priorities. This study is an excellent example of how advances in environmental DNA technologies is helping us meet this need for knowledge.

<p>Hospitals throughout England adapted to tackle the increased demand caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. First, the UK’s National Health Service performed an unprecedented re-arrangement of resources, including postponing non-urgent procedures and providing video consultations. In March 2020, the UK government then introduced a series of interventions, such as social distancing and instructing people to stay at home under national lockdowns.</p>
<p>However, the impact of these measures introduced to cope with the COVID-19 pandemic on emergency department (ED) visits in England is relatively unknown, particularly for non-COVID-19 related emergencies. Therefore, Vollmer and colleagues performed an observational study of ED attendances at the Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust (ICHNT) in London to address this need for knowledge.</p>
<p>After the UK government imposed the first national lockdown from March 12, 2020, to May 31 2020, ED attendances at ICHT dropped by 35%, reflecting broader trends across England. This fall in admissions was mainly amongst those younger than 65 years old who arrived by their own means. ED visits by patients without COVID-19 after March 12, 2020, decreased by 48% and no significant change in hospitalisation outcome was observed for these patients. The extent to which these findings relate to avoidance behaviours due to concerns around coronavirus compared to those seeking alternative emergency health services remains unknown.</p>

<p>All the cells within your body contain the same DNA, but each cell type behaves differently. Proteins, including transcription factors and histones, dictate cell identity by binding to DNA to regulate gene expression. Changes in DNA-protein binding, which control gene activity, underlie development and disease. Therefore, it is important for researchers to investigate specific DNA-protein interactions.</p>
<p>Traditionally, a technique called chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) is used to achieve this goal. However, ChIP has several flaws, which led Skene and Henikoff to develop a new technique named CUT&amp;RUN (Cleavage Under Targets and Release Using Nuclease).</p>
<p>In CUT&amp;RUN, targeted DNA-protein complexes are isolated directly from the cell nucleus rather than following a precipitation step. As in ChIP, to perform CUT&amp;RUN, a specific antibody is used to identify the DNA-binding protein of interest. However, in CUT&amp;RUN, an enzyme that recognises the protein-antibody interaction is used to cut out distinct protein-DNA complexes, which can be isolated and sequenced. Therefore, CUT&amp;RUN permits genomic mapping of DNA-protein interactions in much higher resolution using far fewer cells compared to ChIP.</p>
<p>Due to technical difficulties, it is not always feasible to use the CUT&amp;RUN technique on fresh cells. Therefore, in BMC Research Notes, Boyd and colleagues evaluate how this new method performs using frozen cells. Boyd and colleagues compared a workflow for CUT&amp;RUN with fresh and frozen samples and present an R package named ssvQC for quality control and comparison of data quality derived from this technique. The researchers find that frozen samples serve as a good starting point for performing CUT&amp;RUN for a histone mark (H3K4me3) and a transcription factor (Ikaros).</p>

<p>Cough hypersensitivity is characterised by troublesome coughing triggered by low levels of thermal, mechanical or chemical exposure. For many years, there was no term to describe such coughs with no apparent clinical explanation but this condition has now been named cough hypersensitivity syndrome, giving patients a reassuring and common diagnosis. A better understanding of the risk factors and pathophysiological mechanisms underlying cough hypersensitivity is needed to identify novel targets to manage the condition.</p>
<p>In the linked paper, Cheng et al. investigate cough induced by capsaicin – a chemical irritant derived from chilli peppers. The researchers compared patients with metabolic syndrome with healthy controls. Metabolic syndrome is the medical term given to patients suffering from a combination of diabetes, high blood pressure and obesity. Interestingly, participants with metabolic syndrome were more sensitive to capsaicin-induced cough compared to controls. The researchers further demonstrate that increased capsaicin-induced cough sensitivity in metabolic syndrome patients is closely related to sleep apnea and gastroesophageal reflux and speculate that airway inflammation may play a role in the pathogenesis of increased capsaicin-induced cough sensitivity.</p>

<p>Headaches, including migraines, are one of the most common disorders worldwide. According to the World Health Organisation, almost half the adult population have suffered from a headache at least once within the last year. Many complementary and alternative medicines (CAMs) have been reported to help treat and manage headache disorders, but do they actually have a clinically beneficial effect?</p>
<p>In BMC Complementary Medicine and Therapies, researchers investigate the quantity and quality of CAMs in the context of headache disorders according to clinical practice guidelines (CPGs). CPGs describe statements used to assist practitioner decisions about how to care for people with specific conditions. Ng and Hanna searched literature published between 2009 and 2020 to identify CPGs for treating and managing headache and migraine disorders.</p>
<p>Out of 486 unique search results for terms describing headache disorders, 21 search results containing CPGs were eligible and quality assessed. Fifteen of these CPGs mentioned CAM, of which 13 CPGs made CAM recommendations. These findings could help improve the dialogue between patients and healthcare professionals regarding using CAM therapies to treat/ manage headache and migraine disorders.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/dog-dna-ancient-trade-network-arctic-siberia-europe-near-east">Dog DNA reveals ancient trade network connecting the Arctic to the outside world</a></h4>

              
                <p>Ancient Arctic communities traded with the outside world as early as 7,000 years ago, DNA from the remains of Siberian dogs suggests.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>



<p>Analysis of the DNA shows that Arctic pups thousands of years ago were interbreeding with other dogs from Europe and the Near East, even while they and their owners were living in one of the most remote places on Earth. Along with previous archaeological finds, these results suggest that <a href="https://www.pnas.org/content/118/39/e2100338118">Siberians long ago were connected to a vast trade network</a> that may have extended as far as the Mediterranean and the Caspian Sea, researchers report in the Sept. 28 <em>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences</em>.</p>



<p>Dogs have been valuable commodities in the Arctic for the last 9,500 years and have been used for sledding, hunting, herding reindeer, clothing and food. Because the region is remote, scientists thought local dogs — and their owners — had been completely isolated from the rest of the world for much of that time, an idea supported by the fact that ancient Siberians didn’t exchange much DNA with people outside of the region, says Tatiana Feuerborn, an archaeologist at the University of Copenhagen.</p>



<p>But previous archaeological evidence — including the discovery of glass beads and other foreign goods entombed alongside 2,000-year-old dogs near the Yamal Peninsula in Russia — suggested that these communities were trading with other cultures beyond the Arctic.</p>

<p>After reading about the archaeological evidence in the news, Feuerborn wanted to see if she could use remains from the 2,000-year-old dogs and others from around Siberia to reveal whether an ancient trade network existed.</p>



<p>Dogs rarely wander far from their humans, meaning researchers can “use dogs to understand human movement, like migrations and even trade interactions,” says Kelsey Witt, a geneticist at Brown University in Providence, R.I., who was not involved in the study. For instance, archaeologists have used ancient dog DNA <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/ancient-dog-fossil-domestication-human-path-americas-migration">to push back the arrival date of people</a> in the Americas (<em>SN: 3/1/21</em>).</p>





<p>In the new study, Feuerborn and colleagues analyzed DNA from the remains of 49 Siberian dogs, ranging from 11,000-year-old bone fragments to fur hoods used by Arctic explorers at the turn of the 20th century. The team found that Siberian dogs — unlike their owners — began mixing with other dog populations from the Eurasian steppes, the Near East and even Europe as far back as 7,000 years ago.</p>



<p>The result suggests that Siberians did bring in dogs from the outside world, Feuerborn says. This trade network could have helped transmit new ideas and technologies, such as metalworking, to the Arctic, and may have facilitated Siberian society’s transition from foraging to reindeer herding in the last 2,000 years. &nbsp;</p>



<p>“Dogs are a piece of our past,” Feuerborn says. “By looking at them, we can learn something about ourselves.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/neanderthals-hunting-catching-birds">How catching birds bare-handed may hint at Neandertals’ hunting tactics</a></h4>

              
                <p>Juan Negro crouched in the shadows just outside a cave, wearing his headlamp. For a brief moment, he wasn’t an ornithologist at the Spanish National Research Council’s Doñana Biological Station in Seville. He was a Neandertal, intent on catching dinner. As he waited in the cold, dark hours of the night, crowlike birds called choughs entered the cave.</p>



<p>The “Neandertal” then stealthily snuck in and began the hunt.</p>



<p>This idea to role-play started with butchered bird bones. Piles of ancient tool- and tooth-nicked choughs bones have been found in the same caves that Neandertals frequented, evidence suggesting that the ancient hominids chowed down on the birds. But catching choughs is tricky. During the day, they fly far to feed on invertebrates, seeds and fruits. At night though, their behavior practically turns them into sitting ducks. The birds roost in groups and often return to the same spot, even if they’ve been disturbed or preyed on there before.</p>







<p>So the question was, how might Neandertals have managed to catch these avian prey?</p>



<p>To find out, Negro and his colleagues decided to act like, well, Neandertals. Wielding bare hands along with butterfly nets and lamps — <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/neandertal-made-oldest-known-string">proxy for nets</a> (<em>SN: 04/09/20</em>) and <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/fire-used-regularly-cooking-300000-years">fire</a> (<em>SN: 2/20/14</em>)&nbsp; that Neandertals may have had at hand— teams of two to 10 researchers silently snuck into caves and other spots across Spain, where the birds roost to see how many choughs they could catch.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" width="680" height="503" src="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/100121_tr_birds_inline1.jpg" alt="a person inside a building attempting to catch a bird" class="wp-image-3104497" srcset="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/100121_tr_birds_inline1.jpg 680w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/100121_tr_birds_inline1-518x383.jpg 518w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/100121_tr_birds_inline1-608x450.jpg 608w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/100121_tr_birds_inline1-251x186.jpg 251w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><figcaption><span class="caption wp-caption-3104497">Researchers in Spain attempt to capture choughs with their bare hands in roosting sites such as this building. The effort was part of a study to see if Neandertals could have successfully hunted the birds.</span><span class="credit wp-credit-3104497">J.M. García</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>Using flashes of light from flashlights to resemble fire, the “Neandertals” dazzled and confused the choughs. The birds typically fled into dead-end areas of the caves, where they could be easily caught, often bare-handed. Hunting expeditions at 70 sites <a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fevo.2021.733062/full">snared more than 5,500 birds in all</a>, the researchers report September 9 in <em>Frontiers in Ecology and Evolution</em>. The birds were then released unharmed. It was “the most exciting piece of research” Negro says he’s ever done.</p>



<p>The results demonstrate that through teamwork, choughs can be captured without fancy tools at night and offer a likely way that Neandertals could have captured choughs. But actual Neandertal bird-catching behavior remains unknown. If this is in fact how Neandertals hunted, it adds to claims that their behavior and ability to think strategically is more sophisticated than they are often given credit for.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" width="680" height="439" src="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/100121_tr_birds_inline2.jpg" alt="several black birds inside a sack" class="wp-image-3104498" srcset="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/100121_tr_birds_inline2.jpg 680w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/100121_tr_birds_inline2-593x383.jpg 593w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/100121_tr_birds_inline2-288x186.jpg 288w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><figcaption><span class="caption wp-caption-3104498">Red-billed choughs, captured as part of an experiment to see if Neandertals could have caught the birds, sit in a sack. The birds were released unharmed.</span><span class="credit wp-credit-3104498">Guillermo Blanco</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>“The regular catchment of choughs by Neandertals implies a deep knowledge of the ecology of this species, a previous planning for its obtaining, including procurement techniques, and the ability to plan and anticipate dietary needs for the future,” says Ruth Blasco. A taphonomist at the Catalan Institute of Human Paleoecology and Social Evolution in Tarragona, Spain, Blasco is an expert in Neandertal diet.</p>



<p>Such role playing, she notes, is “commonly used by scholars as valid analogies to infer processes that happened in the past.” For instance, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/why-modern-javelin-throwers-hurled-neandertal-spears-hay-bales">reenactments with replicas of wooden spears</a> have suggested that Neandertals could have hurled the weapons to hunt prey at a distance (<em>SN: 1/28/19</em>).</p>



<p>The researchers re-creating chough hunts used butterfly nets to catch birds fleeing sites with narrow entrances, as well as bigger nets partially covering larger openings. But “the easiest thing was to grab the birds by hand,” Negro says.</p>



<p>“You have to be intelligent to capture these animals, to process them, to roast and eat them,” he notes. Previous studies have shown that Neandertals may have been similarly <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/neandertals-extensive-seafood-menu-rivals-ancient-humans">adept at foraging for seafood</a> (<em>SN: 3/26/20</em>). “We tend to think that [Neandertals] were brutes with no intelligence,” Negro says, “but in fact, the evidence is accumulating that they were very close to <em>Homo sapiens</em>.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/moon-rocks-china-lunar-lander-sample-lava-volcano">China’s lunar rock samples show lava flowed on the moon 2 billion years ago</a></h4>

              
                <p>Lava oozed across the moon’s surface just 2 billion years ago, bits of lunar rocks retrieved by China’s Chang’e-5 mission reveal.</p>



<p>A chemical analysis of the volcanic rocks confirms that <a href="http://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.abl7957">the moon remained volcanically active</a> far longer that its size would suggest possible, researchers report online October 7 in <em>Science</em>.</p>



<p>Chang’e-5 is the first mission <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/china-change-5-mission-moon-rocks-lunar-soil-sample">to retrieve lunar rocks and return them to Earth</a> in over 40 years (<em>SN: 12/1/20</em>). An international group of researchers found that the rocks formed 2 billion years ago, around when multicellular life first evolved on Earth. That makes them the youngest moon rocks ever collected, says study coauthor Carolyn Crow, a planetary scientist at the University of Colorado Boulder. &nbsp;</p>



<p>The moon formed roughly 4.5 billion years ago. Lunar rocks from the Apollo and Soviet missions of the late 1960s and 70s revealed that volcanism on the moon was commonplace for the first billion or so years of its existence, with flows lasting for millions, if not hundreds of millions, of years.</p>

<p>Given its size, scientists thought that the moon started cooling off around 3 billion years ago, eventually becoming the quiet, inactive neighbor it is today. Yet a dearth of craters in some regions left scientists scratching their heads. Parts of celestial bodies devoid of volcanism accumulate more and more craters over time, in part because there aren’t lava flows depositing new material that hardens into smooth stretches. The moon’s smoother spots seemed to suggest that volcanism had persisted past the moon’s early history.  </p>



<p>“Young volcanism on a small body like the moon is challenging to explain, because usually small bodies cool fast,” says Juliane Gross, a planetary scientist at Rutgers University in Piscataway, N.J., not involved in the study.</p>





<p>Scientists had suggested that radioactive elements might offer an explanation for later volcanism. Radioactive decay generates a lot of heat, which is why nuclear reactors are kept in water. Enough radioactive materials in the moon’s mantle, the layer just below the visible crust, would have provided a heat source that could explain younger lava flows.</p>



<p>To test this theory, the Chang’e-5 lander gathered chunks of basalt — a type of rock that forms from volcanic activity — from a previously unexplored part of the moon thought to be younger than 3 billion years old. The team determined that the rocks formed from lava flows 2 billion years ago, but chemical analysis did not yield the concentration of radioactive elements one would expect if radioactive decay were to explain the volcanism.</p>

<p>This finding is compelling scientists to consider what other forces could have maintained volcanic activity on the moon.</p>



<p>One theory, says study coauthor Alexander Nemchin, a planetary scientist at the Beijing SHRIMP Center and Curtin University in Bentley, Australia, is that gravitational forces from the Earth could have liquefied the lunar interior, keeping lunar magma flowing for another billion or so years past when it should have stopped.</p>



<p>“The moon was a lot closer 2 billion years ago,” Nemchin explains. As the moon slowly inched away from the Earth — a slow escape still at work today — these forces would have become less and less powerful until volcanism eventually petered out.</p>





<p>Impacts from asteroids and comets also could have kept the moon’s volcanic juices flowing, but “at this point, any guess is a good guess,” says Jessica Barnes, a planetary scientist at the University of Arizona in Tucson not involved in the study.</p>



<p>“This is a good example of why we need to get to know our closest neighbor,” Barnes says. “A lot of people think we already know what’s going on with the moon, but it’s actually quite mysterious.”</p>

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/~r/plos/Blog/~3/g_ChPbTdgoY/">Following through on our commitment to diversity, equity and inclusion</a></h4>

              
                <!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/loose.dtd">
<html><body><p>Author: Suzanne Farley, Editorial Director, PLOS</p>



<p>Last year, <a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2020/07/our-commitment-to-diversity-equity-and-inclusion/">my predecessor outlined</a> five key areas in which PLOS would redouble its efforts to make our journals a home for diverse voices. So how have we done?</p>



<p>Establishing our baseline was up first: we&rsquo;ve started to manually collate demographic data, while building new tech to streamline the process and ensure personal privacy is protected. Data about PLOS&rsquo; in-house leadership team are already feeding into hiring practices aimed at increasing the number of historically underrepresented employees. And a survey of our 10,000-strong Editorial Board members will be deployed soon.&nbsp;</p>



<p>An updated workflow for recruitment of new Editorial Board members ensures we&rsquo;re casting a wider net. (Want to be considered? <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/s/join-editorial-board">Sign-up here</a>!) Our new editorial partners are helping us publish more research on inequalities, racism, and inequities facing minority and/or marginalized populations. Recent Collections on <a href="https://collections.plos.org/collection/health-gender-diversity/">Health &amp; Health Care in Gender Diverse Communities</a>, <a href="https://collections.plos.org/collection/health-inequities/">Health Inequities and Disparities Research</a>, <a href="https://collections.plos.org/collection/human-trafficking/">Trafficking, Exploitation and Health</a> and <a href="https://collections.plos.org/collection/diagnostic-tests-low-resource/">Diagnostic Tests in Low-Resource Settings</a> showcase these efforts.</p>



<p>The new <a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2021/03/announcing-the-plos-scientific-advisory-council/">PLOS Scientific Advisory Council</a> is bringing the expertise of active researchers at different career stages and geographic areas to bear on organisational strategy. A key strategic pillar has been <a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2021/04/launching-new-journals-2021/">the launch of new journals</a>: <em>PLOS Climate</em>, <em>PLOS Sustainability and Transformation</em>, <em>PLOS Water</em>, <em>PLOS Digital Health</em> and <em>PLOS Global Public Health</em>. Unified in addressing global health and environmental challenges from diverse, local perspectives, the new journals help us expand our international footprint. In this way, we ensure that we&rsquo;re co-creating&mdash;not dictating&mdash;paths to Open Science that work for diverse communities. Formal partnerships, <a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2021/05/partnering-with-tcc-africa/">such as that with TCC Africa</a>, are another way in which local needs can more-fully inform our ways of working.</p>



<p>Moving upstream in the research cycle, we&rsquo;re hoping to help inculcate change in the way research is conducted, as well as how it&rsquo;s communicated. A <a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2021/09/announcing-a-new-plos-policy-on-inclusion-in-global-research/">new policy on inclusivity in global research</a> has just been rolled out. &lsquo;Parachute&rsquo; or &lsquo;helicopter research&rsquo; occurs when researchers travel to under-resourced communities, conduct their studies and leave, often with little or poor understanding or involvement of the communities they studied, and few direct benefits to local participants. Prompting PLOS authors to consider these issues is a small first step towards addressing neo-colonialism in science.&nbsp;</p>



<p>That publishing open access allows the benefits of research to be realised by a broader range of stakeholders is undeniable. But the predominant business model&mdash;an article-processing charge (APC) paid by an individual researcher&mdash;is a key stumbling block to participation. So PLOS has been experimenting with new payment paradigms. Our <a href="https://plos.org/resources/global-equity-model/">new Global Equity</a> and <a href="https://plos.org/resources/community-action-publishing/">Community Action Publishing</a> models, for example, expand equitable partnership opportunities for researchers&rsquo; institutions to eliminate author-facing charges. Global Equity provides affordable pricing tiers reflective of regional economies in every area of the world while Community Action Publishing more fairly distributes the cost of selective publishing.</p>



<p>As well as working on our own policies, processes and people, we&rsquo;ll continue to use our platforms to amplify the voices of others who are working to dismantle structural inequities. If you&rsquo;re interested in hearing more, check out the <a href="https://plos.org/event/inclusion/">inclusion-themed discussions</a> that were part of our recent <a href="https://plos.org/scientists-for-open-science/">Scientists for Open Science</a> event. Or blog posts describing <a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2021/06/the-ocean-womxn-program-supporting-a-new-generation-of-black-oceanographers/">support for a new generation of black oceanographers </a>and <a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2021/09/the-human-evolution-research-institute-challenging-traditional-narratives-and-fostering-a-new-generation-of-black-women-in-the-palaeosciences/">women in the palaeosciences</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We&rsquo;ve made a great start on our commitments&mdash;but there&rsquo;s much more to do. A newly-created Steering Committee will oversee all PLOS&rsquo; DEI-related initiatives, and we&rsquo;ll continue to <a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2021/09/2021-dei-goals-update/">report our progress to you</a>. As someone who&rsquo;s only recently joined PLOS, it&rsquo;s so refreshing to see DEI being truly centered, initiatives being properly resourced, and organisation-wide priority being given to this important work.</p>

                <p class="has-drop-cap" style="font-size:20px">Each year since 2015, <em>Science New</em>s has featured the work of outstanding early- and mid-career scientists in our <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/editors-picks/sn-10-scientists-to-watch">SN 10: Scientists to Watch list</a>. They’re nominated by Nobel laureates and members of the National Academy of Sciences, and are recognized because of their curiosity, passion, determination and, of course, their discoveries.</p>



<p>But we decided that 2021 begs for something different. The <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/editors-picks/2019-novel-coronavirus-outbreak">coronavirus pandemic</a> continues to rage worldwide, with its burdens falling hardest on those least able to bear them — inequities already on our minds due to Black Lives Matter, #MeToo and other social movements. At the same time, we’re learning that <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/climate-change-un-ipcc-report-humans">the window to reverse some of climate change’s most devastating effects is closing fast</a>. With all the upheaval, we wondered: How do these extraordinary times change a scientist’s work?</p>



<p>Here, we catch up with 10 noteworthy Scientists to Watch alumni. Emily Fischer, who studies wildfire smoke, has faced the threat of fires firsthand, cognitive neuroscientist Jessica Cantlon is fighting sexual harassment in the sciences and economist Parag Pathak is taking his efforts to make institutions more equitable from schools to hospitals. Other scientists reveal how their work has gained new urgency and meaning for them. The interviews that follow have been edited for length and clarity. </p>

<h4>Jessica Cantlon</h4>



<p><strong>Cognitive neuroscientist<br>Carnegie Mellon University</strong></p>



<p>Jessica Cantlon, featured in 2016, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/jessica-cantlon-cognitive-neuroscientist-sn-10-scientists-watch">studies the evolution and development of complex mathematical thinking</a>, including the traits that set humans apart from other primates. In 2017, she was recognized as a <em>Time</em> Person of the Year, as <a href="https://time.com/time-person-of-the-year-2017-silence-breakers/">a “silence breaker”</a> speaking out against sexual harassment during the height of the #MeToo movement.</p>



<h5>What has been the most notable progress in your research since 2016?</h5>



<p>We’ve expanded our repertoire to compare people across different cultures, who have different educational practices. We’ve been going to Bolivia to work with this group of people called the Tsimane, who live in rural parts of the Amazon forest. They don’t have the rigid, formal schooling where kids go through these particular curricula to achieve mathematical cognition. Instead, education there is more organic and more deeply connected to their way of life. That allows us to try to understand what effect does a particular type of education have on numerical thinking.</p>



<p>There was one study that we did, comparing species — nonhuman primates and humans — to understand the evolution of these concepts. Across all species and stages of development and cultural groups, there’s this bias that when you’re looking at a set of objects, and you’re trying to quantify it, <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/ncomms13968">you think about that set numerically</a>. And you don’t have to; you can think about that set of objects spatially, as an amount of stuff, you can think about how much surface area is there, or the perimeter around it. But primates, including humans, [tend to] think about that set as a set of discrete objects, and count them up.</p>



<h5>What is something that excites you right now in your work?</h5>



<p>We’ve looked at the similarities and differences between boys and girls as their brains develop. We’ve done some of the first, early studies comparing children’s brains that can truly allow us to collect evidence on the trajectory of similarity between boys and girls…. We’ve shown that very early in development, between around 3 and 8 years of age, there’s evidence during mathematical processing that most of the brain — over 95 percent — shows functional similarity in that processing between boys and girls.</p>



<p>But as we know, much later on in development, we see a severe underrepresentation of girls in mathematics-related fields. What’s happening? There’s evidence in the field … that what happens in late childhood and adolescence is that children’s interests are shaped culturally.</p>



<h5>What are some of the greatest challenges you’ve faced since 2016?</h5>



<p>In 2016, [some of my colleagues at the University of Rochester and I] filed a sexual harassment complaint against a faculty member in our department who was sexually harassing women — undergraduate and graduate students and faculty. It became this situation that hijacked my career for a number of years.… We went public with our complaint, partly to protect ourselves, but also partly to let people know at other universities that this kind of thing is happening to students, and it’s affecting women’s career paths in ways that are discriminatory and unequal.</p>



<p>Ultimately, it was really important. Our complaint went public in September of 2017. In October 2017, the Harvey Weinstein story came out in the <em>New York Times</em>, and that kicked off a series of reactions that ultimately culminated in millions of people saying #MeToo, which I think was really powerful and important, and was something that we got to be a part of.</p>



<p>I’ve had dozens of women reach out to me for advice, about how to file a complaint at their university, how to take legal action, if that’s what they’re thinking, what the risks and benefits are. And so, part of my career now — and I’m excited by it, and I think it’s really important work — is to be an advocate for women who are experiencing discrimination and harassment at universities.</p>



<p>One response that we thought was really great was that the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine <a href="https://www.nap.edu/read/24994/chapter/1">did a full study on sexual harassment in the sciences</a>…. It has a lot of ideas about what might effect larger-scale change. </p>

<h4>Parag Pathak</h4>



<p><strong>Economist</strong><br><strong>MIT</strong></p>



<p>Parag Pathak, featured in 2019, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/parag-pathak-sn-10-scientists-to-watch">strives to make public education more equitable</a>. He has used data and algorithms to overhaul school choice systems in Boston, New York and other U.S. cities. Now he’s applying his research to the question of how to equitably distribute vaccines and other medical resources.</p>



<h5>What’s the most notable progress in your work since 2019?</h5>



<p>Since we last talked, I released a paper on <a href="https://blueprintlabs.mit.edu/research/the-long-term-effects-of-universal-preschool-in-boston/">the effects of universal preschool</a>. A lot of people are interested right now because [universal preschool, which is open to everyone with no income rule,] is part of the White House’s agenda. Because of the work we had done with Boston with their school choice algorithm over the years, we had some files on school admissions going back to the late 1990s. Boston was a leader nationwide in expanding slots for children in preschool. But, like many cities, there weren’t enough slots for demand, so they had to ration. And that’s where the lotteries come in.</p>



<p>Fast forward to now. We linked these applicant cohorts to standardized test scores and educational outcomes all the way into college. And what we found was pretty exciting: Those who won the [preschool] lottery are more likely to graduate high school, they score higher on SATs and they’re more likely to enroll in college. Boston has continued to refine and try to improve [the lottery system]. It’s a model for other cities that are expanding public preschool.</p>



<h5>Are you pursuing any new questions or projects?</h5>



<p>COVID-19 was this huge shock. We all were looking around for how we could be useful, using our respective toolboxes. Tayfun Sönmez, M.&nbsp;Utku Ünver and M. Bumin Yenmez, all of Boston College — the four of us — started to study how scarce medical resources are rationed. And it turns out, there are some parallels with the way school seats are rationed.</p>



<p>One of the ideas that we’ve explored is <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.00374">the idea of a reserve system</a>. In cases where people can’t agree on what’s fair, who should get a vaccine first? It’s very similar to who should get into a school. And the way that [schools] have handled that is they set up more elaborate versions of priority systems. With a vaccine reserve system, you basically have a [supply] that’s reserved for cardiac communities, and one that’s reserved for frontline medical personnel, so on and so forth…. States like California and Massachusetts have used some of our ideas [for their reserve systems].</p>



<p>My wife [Ruma Rajbhandari] is a medical doctor, and my sister [Sapana Adhikari] is an emergency room physician. A big part of my interest in medical rationing guidelines was their having to go to the hospital in March 2020 not knowing what the risks were and not having personal protective equipment. That was something that got me really keen on this debate about frontline health care workers, do they get first priority or not?</p>



<h5>How has the pandemic shifted how you view your work in the area of education?</h5>



<p>I have a kindergartner who was virtual this past year. And he did an amazing job with it. I think what the pandemic has done is rip the Band-Aid off on these lingering problems in society — inequitable access to health care, inequitable access to education, inefficiencies in both of the systems — and has made them much more pronounced. That’s been the theme of our research throughout. We hope more people take these issues on, because the way COVID-19 played out was really a scarring event in terms of haves and the have-nots. </p>

<h4>Jenny Tung</h4>



<p><strong>Evolutionary anthropologist</strong><br><strong>Duke University</strong></p>



<p>Jenny Tung, featured in 2018, studies <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/jenny-tung-sn-10-scientists-watch">how social environments </a>— including social status, relationships and isolation — influence primates’ genes and health. Her study subjects have included captive rhesus macaques and wild baboons.</p>



<h5>What has been the most notable progress in your work since 2018?</h5>



<p>We have built layers of complexity onto [our] initial story. A few years ago we were showing that it’s possible for social interactions to have profound effects on the function of our genome. And now we’re trying to derive a much better understanding of how and why and when, and what are the exceptions.</p>



<p>The other thing I’m really excited about is our ability to move away from this very powerful but very artificial system using captive primates and to ask about what’s going on in the field with wild monkeys. I’ve studied wild baboons in Kenya for many, many years. We know a lot about the social environments, the social experiences. And now with the ability to collect some simple blood samples, we’re also seeing strong signatures of things like social status and social integration, social bonds, social connectedness in the function of these animals’ genomes. That’s pretty exciting because lab studies are powerful and wonderful, but there’s always this question of, “Well, is this real in the real world?”</p>



<h5>You were named a <a href="https://www.macfound.org/fellows/class-of-2019/jenny-tung">MacArthur Fellow in 2019</a>. What have you been pursuing since?</h5>



<p>It was a real honor. It has encouraged us to continue down some of these paths … and to also do some more comparative work and think about species beyond the ones that I have traditionally studied. So in the past few years, I’ve picked up work in other social mammals — wild meerkats and these very social rodents called mole rats — that have their own advantages in giving us insight into how our social world has shaped both how we came to be, our evolutionary past, and how we do day to day in our present.</p>



<p>I’ve been doing more work on something that’s an old love of mine: trying to understand the evolutionary consequences of intermixing between different primates. The population of baboons that I study in Kenya actually sits right at the edge of where the ranges of two different species of baboons meet. And so this population is intermixed between one species, the Anubis baboon, and this other species, the yellow baboon.… We think those patterns of intermixture influence some things about what [the animals] look like, how they behave and so on.… </p>



<p>We know that [humans] have also intermixed a lot with some groups that don’t even exist today, like Neandertals and Denisovans. That process of admixture that we observe right now in living primates [is] potentially relevant to understanding our species’s history.</p>



<h5>What are some of the greatest challenges you’ve faced since 2018?</h5>



<p>In many ways, I felt very fortunate during the pandemic; as an academic with tenure, I have a secure job. But we were also home with a 3-year-old for a long stretch. I spend usually at least a month a year in Kenya, and I have since 2006. But not in 2020. We had to figure out some way of keeping [the research] continuous without any ability to travel there. We have a permanent staff in Kenya — they are Kenyan — who are very important to us and have been working with our project in some cases for many decades, and they were having their own issues, and isolation, and risks in the face of a lot of uncertainty. </p>



<p>I spend a lot of time in my research life thinking about social interactions. And every species that I study … they live in groups. And humans, to a large extent, we live together. We didn’t evolve to be on our own for a long period of time. And so I spent a lot of time reading and thinking and working on, “Why when you don’t have the right sort of social connections, why does your risk of death just shoot up? What’s the consequence of chronic social stress?” One of the things that I really appreciate in a more visceral manner [now] is how important my social network is to me. I think that we’re all looking for ways to connect during the pandemic. And that’s when your personal experience and the things that you’re writing papers about and thinking about really collide. </p>

<h4>Isaac Kinde</h4>



<p><strong>Molecular biologist<br>Thrive Early Detection</strong></p>



<p>Isaac Kinde, featured in 2015, is <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/isaac-kinde-finding-cancer-altered-genes">developing tests to detect cancer early</a>, when treatment is more likely to be successful. In 2019, PapGene, a small biotech start-up where he was chief scientific officer, was acquired by Thrive, cofounded by Kinde. Just this year, it got the backing of the much larger cancer diagnostics firm Exact Sciences.</p>



<h5>Could you tell us about Thrive and what spurred this transition?</h5>



<p>Thrive basically acquired the predecessor company [PapGene]…. There was a lot more money, there’s a lot more expertise, but the core mission didn’t change, which is to develop cancer diagnostic products that we think will have an impact on the lives of people with cancer. We have essentially turbocharged and focused our efforts, leading with the most promising product, which is CancerSEEK.</p>



<p>The premise is we can reduce cancer morbidity and mortality through earlier detection. CancerSEEK is a blood test, and it is a multi-cancer test. That contrasts with the current paradigm, which is one test, one cancer.… Right now, all of our efforts are on making it commercially available.</p>



<h5>CancerSEEK, which is still in testing, picks up on DNA mutations and proteins associated with cancer. How many cancers can it detect at this time?</h5>



<p>There’s good evidence for detecting over 60 to 70&nbsp;percent of the cancers that cause the most deaths per year. That boils down to … colon, breast, lung…. But the [full] range is bigger than those three. There’s esophageal, gastric, kidney, pancreatic. There’s data that support maybe 12 to 13 different cancers.</p>



<h5>You published what you’ve referred to as a “landmark study” in <em>Science</em> last year. What did it find?</h5>



<p>We call it <a href="https://science.sciencemag.org/content/369/6499/eabb9601">a landmark study</a> because it was the first demonstration in a prospective setting of how a multicancer blood test could be used in real time to report results to patients with cancer.</p>



<p>We looked at 10,000 women in the Geisinger Health system. It’s primarily women who are in Pennsylvania…. In the study, 24 [women had cancers] detected with standard-of-care screening: colonoscopy, mammography or low-dose CT scan for lung. Then there were 26 cancers in which the CancerSEEK test detected the cancer first…. Sixty-five percent of the cancers we detected were at a stage prior to stage 4. So [the addition of CancerSEEK] doubled the number of cases that were [found before symptoms were reported] — in many, many cases early enough where some effective therapies could be implemented.</p>



<p>And then it was also safe…. There were very few false positives, and we could very quickly resolve the false positives with whole-body PET-CT imaging. At least two patients [who first had detections from CancerSEEK] had their cancers successfully removed and are thriving as of the last time we checked.</p>



<h5>Routine cancer screenings fell during the pandemic. Has this affected your work?</h5>



<p>It fans the flame, right? The reason why cancer screening went down is not because there was less cancer. It was [just] more difficult for whatever reason to get the appropriate standard-of-care test.… All this did was just strengthen the case that more tools, easier tools are needed for cancer screening. And I think maybe the other feeling is just wishing we could go even faster, but balancing a commercial launch with having all the right pieces in place that will set us up for success.</p>

<h4>Luhan Yang</h4>



<p><strong>Biologist</strong><br><strong>Qihan Biotech</strong></p>



<p>When <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/luhan-yang-sn-10-scientists-to-watch">featured in 2017</a>, Luhan Yang had cofounded and was chief scientific officer of <a href="https://www.egenesisbio.com/">eGenesis</a>, a biotech start-up. She is now cofounder and CEO of <a href="https://www.qihanbio.com/">Qihan Biotech</a>, based in Hangzhou, China, which aims to develop animal organs that are safe for human transplant and to make cell therapies that can treat conditions such as cancer and autoimmune diseases more widely accessible.</p>



<h5>What is some of the most notable progress in your work since 2017?</h5>



<p>The concept of xenotransplantation is to use animal organs as an alternative resource for human transplantation, since there is a huge unmet need for organs. There are two fundamental issues to be addressed. One is [that] there are endogenous retroviruses in the pig genome — some virus sequences — and they can jump around within the pig genome. The viruses can also jump from the pig cell to the human cell. So there is a potential cross-species transmission, which is a huge safety and regulatory concern.… The second hurdle of using pig organs for human transplant, as you can imagine, is rejection, and it is tremendous.</p>



<p>Those are the two fundamental problems … and that’s where we think gene editing can come into play. By 2017, our team had knocked out 62 [retrovirus copies]. Since then, there are three notable milestones: First, we have created our Pig 2.0, with 15 modifications for immunology…. Last year in <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41551-020-00613-9"><em>Nature Biomedical Engineering</em></a>, we showed that those modifications are properly expressed in the pig cell, and the resulting pig is healthy, as well as fertile, and the genetic modification can be passed to the offspring. The second part is we combined the [retrovirus] knockout and the immune rejection–related modification in a single pig. We call it Pig 3.0. So that is a prototype close to clinical trial.</p>



<p>The third part is the most exciting part for us: We need to test the function. [In <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34331749/">a recent study published in the <em>American Journal of Transplantation</em></a>,] we put the pig kidney into a monkey. If it’s a normal pig kidney, it will be rejected in a few minutes. And right now the longest survival of our monkey is about one year.… The monkey experiment demonstrates the possibility of achieving long-term xenotransplantation.</p>



<h5>What was it like to move from the lab to leading a company?</h5>



<p>Being a leader in biotech is not all business. There are three components that are needed. The first part is to set the vision and strategy of the company. In such an innovative area, I think the scientific knowledge, the breadth of the exposure, I think that’s my strength.… The second part is to recruit, retain and train people. And the last part is some business judgment, like how to do fund-raising, how to organize a project, the accounting. I have to admit, I’m not the expert. But I think at my position, the key is to recruit the best people to do the job.… And I started to embrace that every leader has different strengths and weaknesses.</p>



<h5>How has the pandemic influenced your company’s international collaborations?</h5>



<p>I was hoping we could have more in-person meetings or travels, but right now, China still has the quarantine policy that makes it super inconvenient for international travel. Hopefully with the vaccine, the world will become what it was.</p>



<p>I feel the world is more divided compared with 10 years before. And I hope at least for medicine, we can see that our enemy is not a different country, but our enemy is cancer, is organ failure, is COVID, that we can keep and strengthen the collaboration across borders. </p>

<h4>Jeremy Freeman</h4>



<p><strong>Scientist and designer</strong><br><strong>CarbonPlan</strong></p>



<p>When he was featured in 2016, Jeremy Freeman was developing new tools and methods to <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/jeremy-freeman-neuroscientist-sn-10-scientists-watch">help scientists better analyze brain data</a>. Now he is executive director of <a href="https://carbonplan.org/">CarbonPlan</a>, a nonprofit organization that he founded in March 2020 to tackle the climate crisis through open-source data and research.</p>



<h5>You’ve shifted gears since 2016. Tell us about it.</h5>



<p>I moved very far from neuroscience, and I’m now exclusively working on climate change. Our focus [at CarbonPlan] is the scientific integrity and transparency of climate solutions. [We do] a combination of research on different areas of climate science and strategies for addressing climate change. We [also] produce a variety of resources and tools for both the research community and the public at large.</p>



<p>Despite being a radically different field, there are some interesting commonalities, in terms of the value of having very accessible, open, publicly available data that speaks to critical issues. [For climate change,] issues around both what is changing in the climate and how we might address that, in different strategies we might take. Having as much of that information be developed in the open, in a way that others can contribute to, and making work available for others to read and evaluate and criticize and engage with — those are [also] values I felt really strongly about in the world of biomedical science.</p>



<h5>What CarbonPlan work are you most proud of right now?</h5>



<p>We have done a lot of analysis identifying very specific ways in which the implementation of forest carbon offset programs [the planting or preservation of trees to attempt to compensate for carbon emissions] haven’t worked. We did a comprehensive analysis of the role of forest carbon offsets in California’s cap-and-trade program, which is a massive sort of market of offsets on the order of $2 billion, and we identified about $400 million worth of offset credits that in our analysis do not reflect real climate benefits because of errors in how they were calculated with respect to issues that involve fundamental problems in statistics and ecology.</p>



<p>That team effort, led by Grayson Badgley and Danny Cullenward, along with a lot of other work that we’ve done on the role of offsets, is really starting to change the conversation, and wake people up to the fact that these approaches to dealing with climate change haven’t been working.</p>



<h5>What other questions are you looking at?</h5>



<p>There’s an area known as carbon removal, which refers to any mechanisms that draw down CO<sub>2</sub><strong><sub> </sub></strong>from the atmosphere. And carbon removal is really, really complicated, because there are a&nbsp;lot of different ways to potentially accomplish that.… So that’s an area where we’ve been very involved, studying, analyzing, comparing. We helped write, edit and produce <a href="https://cdrprimer.org/">a book called the <em>CDR&nbsp;Primer</em></a> — carbon dioxide removal primer. It’s, of course, a publicly available resource.</p>



<h5>Have recent social justice movements influenced your work?</h5>



<p>Absolutely.… Climate change is so fundamentally an issue of equity and an issue of justice. The burdens of climate change are going to be borne by those who were not directly responsible for it, and those who in many ways have been responsible for it will be more able to avoid its impacts. And there’s a deep injustice in that.… How to think about that is an important aspect of our work.… We’re interested in finding a way to be really complementary to a lot of existing community efforts around these issues. </p>

<h4>Paula Jofré</h4>



<p><strong>Astrophysicist</strong><br><strong>Universidad Diego Portales</strong></p>



<p>Paula Jofré, featured in 2018, used the chemical composition of stars across the Milky Way like DNA to <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/paula-jofre-sn-10-scientists-to-watch">map the stars’ family tree</a>. She recently filled in some details of the tree — and is filling a gap in the publishing world by writing a book about stars in Spanish.</p>



<h5>What progress have you made on your stellar family tree?</h5>



<p>In the first paper, <a href="http://academic.oup.com/mnras/article/467/1/1140/2966869">the tree had three main branches</a>. There was one that we could associate with a young thin disk, which is one of the populations in the Milky Way. Another was associated with an old, thick disk, which was the older component of the Milky Way. And then we had something in between…. Now, because we had more stars and more chemical elements and we made a better selection of which chemical elements to include, we could find that this strange population was actually an ancestor population of the thin disk. And one of the interpretations we had in the second paper [published in January in the <em>Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society</em>] <a href="https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article-abstract/502/1/32/6081048">was that they were produced all very quickly</a>.</p>



<p>Other groups have found striking evidence of a galaxy that was merged into the Milky Way [billions of years ago]. And that [merging and mixing of gas] could have triggered what is called a star formation burst — lots of stars [forming] at the same time. So, it’s kind of exciting that we find in the tree a feature that could be attributed to a star formation burst … a few gigayears after the [merger of these two galaxies] that we know happened.</p>



<h5>You’re also writing a popular book on stars. Can you tell me more about the book,<em> Fósiles del cosmos: descifrando la historia de la Vía Láctea</em>, or <em>Fossils of the Cosmos: Deciphering the History of the Milky Way</em>, and why you decided to write it?</h5>



<p>It’s going to be published in November [in Chile]. It’s a book in Spanish for the public. I am teaching a class about stars in the Milky Way, a general astronomy class. And I’ve been finding that there is no proper literature in Spanish for the students.… The level is sometimes way too basic or too complex. So I wanted to write something for their level.</p>



<p>[The book] explains how stars create the chemical elements, what’s the role of Gaia [a satellite mission to map the galaxy], what’s the role of the Milky Way Mapper [another survey using Earth-based telescopes], about all these big surveys, why we care, what’s going on.</p>



<p>When I started writing it, of course, I started reading other books…. In all these general astronomy books, women are never highlighted. In my book, I have lots of quotes from 40 different women all around the world, working in my field.… I want to make the point that you can be a woman, you can be clever, you can dedicate yourself to something that is mentally challenging. You can be like any of these 40 women.</p>



<h5>What’s the greatest challenge that you’ve faced since 2018?</h5>



<p>The biggest challenge has been to promote hiring more women at the faculty level. Chile’s a very small country and they love new figures, young figures being highlighted by the United States. The moment I was in <em>Science News</em>,I became very popular [in Chile] very quickly. They needed the inspirational woman. And I kept saying, “I don’t want to be the only one. I want more women.”</p>



<p>I don’t know if you were aware of this collective Las Tesis; they made <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aB7r6hdo3W4">a dance for the social unrest that we had in Chile</a> before the pandemic. It was a feminist movement that resonated for so many people in the world. The movement [says]: We want to be treated with respect, we want the same salary, we want the same opportunities, we want to feel safe on the streets.… But then, when you are fewer in academia, you’re not going to start jumping on the table and dancing, right? You have to argue … it’s difficult. </p>

<figure class="wp-block-image alignwide size-full"><img loading="lazy" width="1030" height="580" src="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/100921_SN10-qi_1030.jpg" alt="Stanley Qi" class="wp-image-3104180" srcset="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/100921_SN10-qi_1030.jpg 1030w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/100921_SN10-qi_1030-680x383.jpg 680w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/100921_SN10-qi_1030-800x450.jpg 800w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/100921_SN10-qi_1030-330x186.jpg 330w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/100921_SN10-qi_1030-768x432.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1030px) 100vw, 1030px" /><figcaption><span class="credit wp-credit-3104180">S. QI</span></figcaption></figure>



<h4>Stanley Qi</h4>



<p><strong>Bioengineer</strong><br><strong>Stanford University</strong></p>



<p>By disabling the DNA-cutting enzyme in the CRISPR system, Stanley Qi, featured in 2019, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/stanley-qi-sn-10-scientists-to-watch">created a new and versatile tool</a>. Attaching a range of molecules to these “dead Cas” enzymes has yielded an entire toolbox worth of DNA and RNA manipulators.</p>



<h5>Is the strategy of disabling Cas molecules still popular among researchers?</h5>



<p>I feel it’s getting more popular, for a number of reasons: One, people use … this tool to study how the genome works. Two, there are some new efforts using the tool to treat some genetic diseases. And three, there are some other exciting uses of this tool to think about other diseases, other topics that we can possibly tackle.</p>



<p>For example, this CRISPR system came from bacteria cells, right? They were used as weapons by the bacteria to fight against invading viruses. So we said, “OK, humans also have many foes like invading viruses. Can we repurpose this CRISPR to help us fight our infectious diseases?” That was the idea before the COVID-19 pandemic. We practiced first on influenza, seasonal flu…. We adapted a type of CRISPR system that targets a specific RNA molecule, and it works pretty well. I remember it working in January [2020] when the news started reporting, “Oh, there’s a new virus, it’s an RNA virus,” and we thought immediately, “What if we use this tool on this new RNA virus?”</p>



<p>Instead [of using the live virus], we used synthetic biology to mimic the RNA sequence.… [And we found] we can still very rapidly cleave and destroy this RNA virus and its fragments in the human lung cells. We were really excited. Since then we’ve been working very hard to follow up on the idea, to make this as fast as possible into a possible antiviral. <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32353252/">We called it PAC-MAN</a>.</p>



<h5>Can you talk a bit about how the dead Cas, or dCas, approach has been improved and adapted?</h5>



<p>One bigger use is for treating disease like a gene therapy. However, there’s still a number of features that have not been ideal for easy use or testing in clinics.… [For patient care,] people always think about making the system very, very compact and suitable into a nanoparticle or into a viral particle, so we can deliver them with ease into the human body. So that requires <a href="https://www.cell.com/molecular-cell/fulltext/S1097-2765(21)00648-1">a miniaturization of the CRISPR system</a>. And we actually did some work on that…. They are like two-thirds smaller than what people use.</p>



<p>And second is, many of these natural proteins from bacteria don’t work very well [in human cells].… So we did some protein engineering. Following these efforts, we actually created some highly compact, yet highly efficient dCas systems that can be easily delivered into the human body to turn on or off genes.</p>



<h5>What are the greatest challenges you’ve faced in the last couple of years?</h5>



<p>We are bioengineers and we think our strength is in creating stuff, modifying. Now as we step into the domain of applying these tools to solve real-world problems, the challenge is how to build a bridge between where we are to where we want to go. That usually requires learning a significant amount about a disease, about a new field, and thinking creatively on how to interface two fields. </p>

<h4>Emily Fischer</h4>



<p><strong>Atmospheric chemist</strong><br><strong>Colorado State University</strong></p>



<p>Emily Fischer, featured in 2020, is in the midst of <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/sn-10-scientists-to-watch-2020#fischer">one of the most comprehensive analyses of wildfire smoke ever attempted</a>. Since we last chatted with Fischer, her wildfire research and the way she talks about it have become more personal.</p>



<h5>Have you started any projects since 2020?</h5>



<p>We’re looking at the impact of smoke on the visible light range where photosynthesis occurs. There’s smoke blanketing the U.S. in summers now. Regardless of whether it’s at the ground, it’s somewhere in the atmosphere between the sun and the plants on the ground. In the Midwest, for example, over our corn and soybean belt, there’s smoke between a third to half of the days on average in July and August, during peak growing season. What does that mean for crops? How is that changing the light at the surface? If it’s boosting the diffuse fraction of radiation, and not decreasing the total radiation, that’s a boost to productivity.</p>



<h5>Last year, you helped launch a national group called Science Moms. What is that?</h5>



<p>We are a nonpartisan group of scientists who are also mothers. The goal of <a href="https://sciencemoms.com/?gclid=CjwKCAjwy7CKBhBMEiwA0Eb7ag_v-5mGZoCRiGePqLzDycKpz0G8pnlxL-wrFmf7hg_yJbOwhvtwchoCPtcQAvD_BwE">Science Moms</a> is for us to speak directly [via a website, videos and events] on climate change to other mothers in ways that are accurate, digestible and also engaging. While roughly 60 percent of the U.S. population is worried about climate change, like 85 percent of moms are worried about climate change. But they don’t feel comfortable talking about it, or know how to talk to their representatives about it or even talk to their book club about it.</p>



<h5>How have people responded to your outreach efforts?</h5>



<p>I get all sorts of messages: “This is so different than any other climate communication that I’ve ever seen.” We’re trained as scientists to take the emotion out of things, but actually it’s very important for people to understand the feeling of climate change.</p>



<p>Last summer [2020], extreme fires impacted my own home. We had smoke here for multiple months, and my family ran from the Cameron Peak Fire.… For me, there was a shift from “These are the numbers, these are the graphs,” to “Oh, this is what my graphs feel like, this is what this trend feels like.”</p>



<h5>Did your experience fleeing a wildfire shift your perspective around your science?</h5>



<p>I’m the kind of person who studies what I see.… And so I should not have been surprised by that fire. I was out backpacking with my family, and it started one range over and my kids and I ran out, and we made it. So it was OK, but I was not sure it would be OK. When something like that happens to you, you have to respond to it. [Now] I think, when we calculate a change in something going forward, what does that mean? What are all the impacts that that could have?</p>



<p>Also, seeing the incident management teams working together to help people [during the fire] was very inspiring. I would say to my husband, “These teams are beautiful. They are functioning at such a high level under such hard conditions. If we could just harness this level of cooperation toward climate change action, or toward eliminating the pandemic, we [could] do anything.” </p>

KIPPING</span></figcaption></figure>



<h4>David Kipping</h4>



<p><strong>Astronomer</strong><br><strong>Columbia University</strong></p>



<p>After being <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/david-kipping-sn-10-scientists-to-watch">featured in 2017</a>, David Kipping and his colleagues formally reported in <em>Science Advances</em> <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/hubble-may-have-spotted-first-known-exomoon">the first detection of a potential exomoon</a> — a moon orbiting a planet outside of the solar system. Signs of the Neptune-sized moon were spotted around a Jupiter-sized planet 8,000 light-years from Earth. Kipping has been hunting for more ever since, and has also become a hit on YouTube.</p>



<h5>Have you found any more exomoons?</h5>



<p>Well, I can’t really talk about that. We are close to releasing the results of a new survey of the ensemble of Jupiter-like planets discovered by the Kepler space telescope. Such planets are thought to be the best hunting ground for moons, being far from the gravitational influence of their star and large enough to support potentially massive moons. Unfortunately, the results are still not quite ready.</p>



<h5>How have other scientists reacted?</h5>



<p>The community is naturally skeptical. That was kind of the story of exoplanets. When researchers first discovered a hot Jupiter, no one believed it. It wasn’t until they discovered about 10 of them that people started to say that, actually, maybe these are real. I don’t know how it’s going to go with any exomoon candidate. Maybe what we’ve found is genuinely bogus, but I obviously hope not. We did our due diligence, and we’re very careful with the results.</p>



<p>It’s maybe not surprising that the first ones we find are going to be so large, because after all, they’re going to be the easiest to detect.… Actually, less than 1&nbsp;percent of sunlike stars have hot Jupiters, but they dominated all of the first exoplanet detections just because they were so easy to find. Maybe the same thing will play out here.</p>



<h5>In 2017, you had just launched a YouTube channel called Cool Worlds. How is that outreach going?</h5>



<p>It’s been pretty overwhelming to us, because I’d never expected to get anywhere near the number of people watching who have watched. The <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZRDONE4zng&amp;ab_channel=CoolWorlds">last video [on what’s called the red sky paradox] got 200,000 views</a>, and the one before it got 500,000. I mean, that’s just bonkers. I get e-mails from people, really amazing e-mails, that say how much the channel and the videos mean to them. That’s really incredible.</p>



<p>We have lots of people actually financially supporting us now. We give them special access to the videos and early access to the papers we’re writing. We hang out with some of them once every two months on a livestream and chat about science. It’s starting to be enough that I’m funding students through donations. I have this dream that I do research, it produces cool ideas, I talk about it on my outreach channel, people get excited about it and they support us, which enables me to do more research.</p>



<h5>What are the greatest challenges you’ve faced since 2017?</h5>



<p>I’m still [working to earn] tenure. It’s obviously one of the most stressful periods of your career because you don’t have that safety net yet that some young tenured colleagues enjoy. At the same time, you’re trying to raise a family and make sure you see your kids growing up. You don’t want to be a ghost at home. And so that’s been tricky, but [the pandemic] enabled me to spend a lot more time at home with the family. </p>

In 2019, though, research in Germany concluded that <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2019/10/15/the-stereotype-of-the-narcissistic-only-child-is-widespread-but-its-wrong/">while the idea that only children are more narcissistic is widespread, it&#8217;s wrong</a>. Now a team in China has failed to find any evidence for another of the clichés: that only children are more selfish.</p>



<span id="more-44039"></span>



<p>In <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/19485506211038190">a paper</a> in <em>Social Psychology and Personality Science</em>, Xuegang Zheng at Shaanxi Normal University and colleagues first confirm that this particular stereotype indeed exists — among adults who grew up with siblings, at least. (In the paper, the team uses the term &#8220;only children&#8221; and &#8220;non-only children&#8221; to refer to adults without or with siblings.) This group consistently tended to rate &#8220;typical&#8221; only children as being less prosocial (or more selfish) than non-only children; however, the only children in this study rated both groups the same. The team used various scales to gather these ratings, including a version of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dictator_game">dictator game</a>, in which the participants were asked to judge how much of a given amount of money a &#8220;typical&#8221; only child or non-only child would be willing to share with them. </p>



<p>In a second study of 391 adults (169 of whom were only children), the researchers used the same altruism scales (including the dictator game), but this time asked the participants to rate themselves. They found no differences between the two groups; only children did not emerge as being any more selfish than children with siblings.</p>



<p>This particular stereotype is thought to stem, at least in part, from the idea that only children grow up as the sole focus of their parents’ attention. If this is the case, there may be upsides. Some earlier work has found, for example, that only children tend to report better, warmer relationships with their parents. Perhaps, the researchers reasoned, only children might be <em>more </em>altruistic (or less selfish) towards the people closest to them. So they investigated this idea in a third study.</p>



<p>A group of 99 Chinese students (about half were only children) first identified people at varying social distances from them — from parents, through friends and acquaintances, to strangers. Across a series of trials, each participant was offered a small sum of money and asked whether they wanted to keep it for themselves or share it with a given target person on their social distance scale. (The social distance between the participant and this target person varied across the trials, and the researchers did actually pay out a small proportion of the offered money.)</p>



<p>If the only children were actually <em>more</em> selfless than non-only children with the people closest to them — or perhaps more selfish than non-only children with people they knew less well — this should have been evident in the data. But it wasn’t. Again, there were no differences in the results for the two groups. Though the finding of equal results for only children and non-only children in the second study came only from self-report data, these findings on actual behaviour shore up&nbsp; the conclusion that the stereotype is wrong.</p>



<p>It’s worth noting that the sample sizes in these studies were small. And the results might not be generalisable beyond China (where of course the one-child policy has had a big impact), or even across China (as the samples were not nationally representative). Also, these studies were all on adults who had grown up with or without siblings, rather than only <em>children</em>. Still, the results do add to the growing evidence against common stereotypes about only children — or &#8220;only adults&#8221;, at least.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/giant-ground-sloths-meat-scavenger-paleontology">Giant ground sloths may have been meat-eating scavengers</a></h4>

              
                <p>Modern sloths may be dedicated vegetarians, but at least one of their massive Ice Age cousins chowed down on meat when it had the chance. &nbsp;Darwin’s ground sloth — which could grow to over 3 meters long and weigh as much as about 2,000 kilograms — may have been an opportunistic scavenger, chemical analyses of fossil sloth hair suggest.</p>



<p>Paleontologist Julia Tejada of the University of Montpellier in France and colleagues analyzed the chemical makeup of two amino acids, the building blocks of proteins, within the fossil hair of two <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/footprints-prove-humans-hunted-giant-sloths-during-ice-age">giant ground sloth species</a>: Darwin’s ground sloth (<em>Mylodon darwinii</em>) of South America and the Shasta ground sloth (<em>Nothrotheriops shastensis</em>) of North America (<em>SN: 4/25/18</em>). The team compared these with samples from living sloths, anteaters and other modern omnivores.</p>





<p>Nitrogen isotopes, different forms of the element, can vary a lot among different food sources as well as between ecosystems. Those isotope values in one amino acid, glutamine, change significantly with diet, increasing the higher the animal is on the food chain. But diet has little impact on the nitrogen values in another amino acid, phenylalamine. By comparing the nitrogen isotopes in the two amino acids found in the sloths’ hair, the researchers were able to eliminate ecosystem effects and zoom in on diets.</p>





<p>The data reveal that while the diet of the Shasta ground slothwas exclusively plant-based, <a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41598-021-97996-9">Darwin’s ground sloth was an omnivore</a>, Tejada and colleagues report October 7 in <em>Scientific Reports</em>.</p>



<p>The findings upend what scientists thought they knew about the ancient animals. Scientists have assumed the ancient creatures were herbivores. That’s in part because all six modern species of sloth are <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/blog/wild-things/three-toed-sloths-are-even-more-slothful-two-toed-sloths">confirmed vegetarians</a>, and in part giant ground sloths’ teeth and jaws weren’t adapted for hunting or powerful chewing and tearing (<em>SN: 6/20/16</em>).</p>



<p>But Darwin’s ground sloth could have managed to ingest already-killed meat, Tejada and colleagues say. And that might help solve a long-standing puzzle: the apparent absence of large carnivorous mammals in South America at the time. Darwin’s ground sloth, the researchers add, may have filled a vacant ecological niche: the scavenger who wouldn’t say no to a meaty meal.</p>
