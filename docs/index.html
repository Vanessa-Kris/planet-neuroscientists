              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/covid-rebound-infection-paxlovid-biden-fauci">COVID-19 infections can rebound for some people. It’s unclear why</a></h4>

              
                <p>For some people, including President Joe Biden and National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases director Anthony Fauci, the relief of vanishing COVID-19 symptoms and a negative test is fleeting. Biden, Fauci and many others have seen their tests turn positive again or have unwelcome symptoms return after taking a five-day course of the antiviral Paxlovid. Other people, including my husband, have had their infections rebound even without taking the drug.</p>



<p>Multiple studies have described cases of “Paxlovid rebound” after treatment. In one, seven Paxlovid-treated patients <a href="https://academic.oup.com/cid/advance-article/doi/10.1093/cid/ciac512/6614635">had the virus rebound</a> to high levels after treatment ended, and symptoms returned for six of them, virologist Jonathan Li and colleagues reported in June in <em>Clinical Infectious Diseases</em>. Samples from three patients even carried infectious virus, a clue that some people who rebound might infect others. Another study that has yet to be peer-reviewed by other researchers found that <a href="https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.06.21.22276724v1">fewer than 6 percent of people in the study who&#8217;d been prescribed Paxlovid</a> had rebound infections in the month after finishing treatment.</p>





<p>It’s unclear why Paxlovid rebound happens, says Li, of Brigham and Women’s Hospital and Harvard Medical School. Studies show that people given the drug still develop a strong immune response to the virus after five days of treatment. “I think what’s happening in that situation is that you’ve got virus replication that’s been inhibited. All of a sudden, the drug has disappeared and the virus has a momentary opportunity to replicate. And it replicates to high levels,” Li says. But by then, the immune system has learned to fend off the coronavirus. If the recently trained immune cells encounter newly made viruses and set off alarm bells, symptoms may briefly come back.</p>



<p>Some people might not want to take the drug because they’re worried about rebound, Li says. But Paxlovid itself probably isn’t the cause. The drug’s not failing. It is still highly effective in preventing severe disease. “I would not hesitate to give my patients Paxlovid,” Li says. “I do tell them to be on the lookout for rebounding symptoms. But it doesn’t dissuade me in terms of prescribing it.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Fauci took another course of Paxlovid in the wake of his rebound. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration says that there’s <a href="https://www.fda.gov/drugs/news-events-human-drugs/fda-updates-paxlovid-health-care-providers">no evidence that 10 days of treatment is any more effective than five days</a>, or that patients need a repeat. But, researchers are <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2022/08/01/biden-rebound-covid-infection-paxlovid/">testing whether taking the drug for a longer period of time</a> might prevent rebound.</p>



<p>Rebounding COVID-19 isn’t limited to patients who take Paxlovid. Li recalls that even in the early days of the pandemic, some patients would come to him in the hospital saying that they’d started to feel better but got worse again. It’s hard to know how to interpret such anecdotal reports, he says. Researchers are still learning what an untreated viral infection can look like in the body. While the virus’s (hopefully) brief invasion may appear straightforward on average — with virus levels in the body increasing to a peak before slowly declining as the person recovers — not everyone follows that pattern.</p>

<p>My husband got COVID-19 two months ago. His symptoms lasted about a week, and he was delighted to see the line on his antigen test getting fainter. Even so, despite feeling perfectly healthy, the line was suddenly back at full strength almost immediately after he added his sample to a new test days later. He was frustrated and, as a social person, lamented having to stay isolated.</p>



<p>Studies show he’s not alone. When Li and colleagues studied the course of disease in COVID-19 clinical trial participants who received a placebo treatment, <a href="https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.08.01.22278278v1.full.pdf">1 in 8 people experienced a rebound</a>, with symptoms coming back for 1 in 4 people. That rebound, however, typically lasted about a day, and few had both high viral loads and returning symptoms, the team reports in a preliminary study posted August 2 at medRxiv.org that hasn’t yet been peer-reviewed by other scientists.</p>



<p>In this case, there’s no disappearing drug. Any returning symptoms without a positive test might be from something else such as allergies or a different respiratory virus, Li says. It’s also possible that the virus is replicating in different parts of the body at different times. Some tests might end up negative when the body eliminates virus from the throat, for example, but it’s still replicating at low levels in the nose.</p>



<p>That latter scenario may have happened with my husband. In a confusing twist, he tested negative on two saliva PCR tests while continuing to test positive on nasal antigen tests. A PCR test is far more sensitive, so we expected the opposite to happen. Since experts say to<a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/covid-coronavirus-rapid-test-at-home-positive-cases"> consider a positive antigen test as a sign you’re still contagious</a>, he stayed isolated until he finally tested negative on an antigen test two weeks after his first symptoms appeared.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Luckily, he’s fully recovered now, and not at all eager for a repeat experience. That means we’re both still masking in public spaces and taking other precautions. We know we’re not done with this pandemic.</p>

<p><strong>The icy world of organ freezing </strong>– <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/icy-world-organ-freezing"><em>Science News</em></a>, August 19, 1972</p>



<p>If whole organs could be frozen and stored … surgeons would be able to perform far more transplants…. For all their efforts, though, cryobiologists (biologists who study the effects of cold on life) have not been very successful with organ freezing…. Nobody to date has cooled whole mammalian hearts any lower [than −20° Celsius] or longer [than six hours] and revived them.</p>





<h4>Update</h4>



<p>Scientists still struggle to keep donor hearts on ice for longer than six hours, but it is now possible to store a different organ — the liver — at below-freezing temperatures for more than a day. The challenge has been figuring out how to stop ice from crystallizing and damaging cells. In 2019, scientists reported successfully warming up several human livers after <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/supercooling-chemicals-tripled-shelf-life-donor-organs">supercooling them for 27 hours</a> (<em>SN: 10/12/19 &amp; 10/26/19, p. 10</em>). This and other preservation methods such as <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11267128/">freezing at high pressures</a> or <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/scitranslmed.aah4586">thawing using nanoparticles</a> aren’t yet ready for the operating room, but they have the potential to keep thousands of lifesaving organs from going to waste each year.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/renaissance-beauty-chemistry-plants-ingredients">These researchers are unlocking Renaissance beauty secrets</a></h4>

              
                <p>Art historian Erin Griffey is a bit of a beauty maven. “I’m one of those people who reads the backs of beauty products,” she says. That’s why, while working on a book about beauty culture in Renaissance Europe, Griffey experienced déjà vu.</p>



<p>She noticed that many ingredients in beauty recipes from the 16th to 18th centuries — compiled from books, cosmetic recipe collections, medical texts, health regimen manuscripts, herbals and pharmacopeias — also appear on modern beauty packaging. For instance, rosewater is used in modern skin-hydrating mists and sulfur is found in some over-the-counter acne creams.</p>





<p>Such similarities are clues to what Renaissance-era people used the products for and how the products worked. But they are not the whole story. That’s because the ancient recipes often also list bizarre or even dangerous ingredients, from bile acids and calves’ hooves to lead and the poisonous bryony plant. To get a better understanding, Griffey wanted to re-create the recipes. So she turned to her colleagues at the University of Auckland in New Zealand. Thus the <a href="https://www.beautifulchemistryproject.com/">Beautiful Chemistry Project</a> was born.</p>



<p>The team started with what Griffey calls “sticky recipes” because they’re found in many sources throughout the Renaissance period: rosemary flowers in white wine, myrrh powder with egg white, and the velvety covering of newly grown deer antlers <a href="https://medlineplus.gov/druginfo/natural/808.html"></a>with bean flour.</p>



<p>The recipes tend to be vague and varied. So chemist Michel Nieuwoudt and her team experiment with the measurements and procedures while Griffey searches various sources for more clues to ingredient types and ratios.</p>



<p>“We knew we could not re-create it exactly as is,” Griffey says of the recipe for rosemary flowers in white wine. “We do not have access to the rosemary plants that grew 500 years ago or the wines and whatever their chemical makeup was.” But this legwork “enabled us to get closer to an approximation<a></a>.”</p>



<p>Nieuwoudt and her team boiled rosemary flowers in round-bottom flasks each filled with a different solution: sweet white wine, dry white wine, ethanol in water or aqua vitae. Once the researchers filtered out the flowers and analyzed the resulting mixtures using gas chromatography and mass spectrometry, they found chemical compounds that are common in today’s skin care products, including soothing camphor, eucalyptol and <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/making-scents-flowers">the fragrant alcohol linalool</a> (<em>SN: 7/22/02</em>).</p>



<p>The Renaissance-era recipe stated the potion would “make the face fair.” Nieuwoudt’s findings suggest how: by toning and moisturizing skin.</p>

Chemists re-created the recipe and found that the resulting liquid (right) — shown in the Renaissance-style bottle on the left — contains camphor, eucalyptol and linalool, which suggests the product acts as a hydrating skin toner. The bottle on the right contains the extract from a myrrh concoction.</span><span class="credit wp-credit-3116259">E. Griffey, M. Nieuwoudt</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>The team has also made progress on unlocking the secrets of myrrh powder and egg whites. Experiments suggest that myrrh draws out proteins from egg whites and the egg whites extract resins, sugars and volatiles from the myrrh. That results in a serumlike product that has antiseptic and anti-inflammatory properties and probably stimulates collagen growth, Nieuwoudt says. “It seems there’s a synergy between all of these different ingredients, and this is why it works.”</p>



<p>As for what deer velvet and bean flour may have been used for, the researchers are still teasing out results. And they have yet to tackle recipes with dangerous ingredients.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Eventually, the researchers hope to perfect their re-creations and bring the products to drug store shelves — minus, of course, any unsafe ingredients. “I think people will want to go back to something that is natural, and it’s also appealing for people to think they’re using Renaissance products,” Nieuwoudt says. Until then, the beauty for the researchers lies in “digging [the recipes] out and understanding them.”</p>

          <p><strong>George: </strong>As the Deputy Editor in Chief, I work closely with Emily, overseeing the development and implementation of the journal&rsquo;s editorial vision, our editorial strategy, and the journal&rsquo;s editorial activities to engage with our communities. I also work with other teams supporting PLOS ONE to ensure efficiency and quality of manuscript handling by the Editorial Board and the quality of the published output</p>
        </div>
      </div>
    


<p><strong>During your time at PLOS, what initiative/s have you been involved with to ensure fairness in science (policies etc.)?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Emily: </strong>I would say <em>PLOS ONE</em>, as a journal, was developed in order to embody fairer practices in research publication. It was the first journal to publish all rigorous science research and make it openly available to the public. By eliminating criteria for novelty or impact, <em>PLOS ONE</em> changed how we assess high-quality research and created opportunities for researchers to publish and get credit for their work. Each of us who work for the journal play a role in continuing that legacy, striving toward fairer practices across each stage of the publishing process at <em>PLOS ONE</em>.</p>



<p>As a recent example, we&rsquo;re currently working on simplifying our appeals process. The appeals process exists to ensure that authors have the ability to challenge decisions that they perceive to be unfair or incorrect. The changes that we will be introducing to the appeals process will help ensure that it is straightforward for authors and that it provides support to PLOS ONE Academic Editors in handling potentially tricky manuscripts.</p>



<p><strong>George: </strong>I think one of the most important initiatives I&rsquo;ve been able to work on is the development of a PLOS-wide policy, <a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2021/09/announcing-a-new-plos-policy-on-inclusion-in-global-research/">Inclusivity in Global Research</a>, which launched in September last year. The new policy aims to address concerns related to a practice called &ldquo;parachute research&rdquo;, also known as &ldquo;helicopter&rdquo; or &ldquo;neo-colonial science&rdquo;. Parachute research occurs when researchers travel to under-resourced communities, conduct their research, and leave, often with little understanding or involvement of the communities they studied, and few direct benefits to local participants. As part of the policy, authors conducting research in other countries or communities are asked to complete a questionnaire that outlines ethical, cultural, and scientific considerations specific to inclusivity in global research.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The policy itself was developed collaboratively, with members of the research community across different countries. Our aim was to improve awareness of the concerns related to global research, laying foundations for future development of additional policies in this area.</p>



<p><strong>Why do you think this is important for science?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Emily: </strong>I think it&rsquo;s important that scientific progress is a dialogue &ndash; where authors, reviewers, editors, and the community discuss ideas and build consensus. Fairness helps instill trust in science. If the community perceives a policy (or a person or a journal) to be unfair, they won&rsquo;t engage with it, meaning that the important process of agreeing, arguing and eventually coming to a shared understanding that allows decisions and further discovery to move forward won&rsquo;t happen. So I think it&rsquo;s really important that PLOS ONE pursues policies that are grounded in principles of inclusivity, anti-bias and fairness to enable everyone to engage with the process of scientific communication and discovery.</p>



<p><strong>George:</strong><strong> </strong>I agree and I think<strong> </strong>our new policy is a good example of this. Research is better when it involves members of the local community; these individuals can add knowledge and expertise that others cannot. It&rsquo;s important that their perspectives are heard and given due weight in the scholarly discourse. I hope the policy raises awareness of these concerns and encourages better and more meaningful international collaboration in research, especially with those in low- and middle-income countries. This can bring long-term benefits as knowledge is shared between research teams, building local, individual and institutional research capacity.</p>



<p><strong>What does it mean to you personally to be involved in work like this?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Emily: </strong>I care very deeply that PLOS ONE continues its mission to support the advancement of research by focusing on rigor rather than perceived impact, and I strongly support efforts to increase fairness, transparency and trust in the review and publication process. Asking reviewers and academic editors to focus on objective measures such as the inclusion of proper controls and whether the conclusions are supported by the data reported eliminates a source of bias in the publication process. I really enjoy being part of a journal and community that has taken active steps to move away from the tyranny of a very small minority determining what&rsquo;s &ldquo;hot&rdquo; or important or worthy in scholarly communication. I want research to be reviewed and published rapidly, and openly accessible to all, so that we as a society can benefit from these advances in knowledge.</p>



<p><strong>George:</strong><strong> </strong>It&rsquo;s been a fantastic experience to work on the Inclusivity in Global Research policy as its implementation has the potential to change the way in which research is conducted, something that can be difficult to achieve with editorial policy. I strive for equity in research and its dissemination and hope that this policy has moved the needle in ensuring fairer research collaboration.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>By the end of your career, what do you hope people will think about your contribution?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Emily: </strong>In a way, I hope I&rsquo;m remembered by what people <em>didn&rsquo;t</em> see published in PLOS ONE &ndash; for example, studies that didn&rsquo;t have appropriate ethical approval, or research funded by tobacco companies. I hope that the community will think that PLOS ONE had fair policies applied in a consistent manner that supported its mission. But I also hope that my contribution towards this is not highly visible. The policies and workflows that we have on PLOS ONE have been co-developed with our communities and are designed to address specific needs that have been raised by different groups. The journal does not operate in a top-down manner such that I will place any particular stamp on it&ndash;rather, I want my time as Editor in Chief to be marked by increased collaboration and communication with all groups who access the journal, and the recognition that PLOS ONE exists solely to serve the needs of the community.</p>



<p><strong>George: </strong>I think everyone should have equal opportunity to access and contribute to the publication of academic research. I hope that my contributions to <em>PLOS ONE</em> will ensure that everyone can publish well-conducted research, regardless of where they are from, the topic studied, or the perceived novelty of their work.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/humans-primates-voice-control-cords-larynx-membrane">Why humans have more voice control than any other primates</a></h4>

              
                <p>A crying baby, a screaming adult, a teenager whose voice cracks — people could have sounded this shrill all the time, a new study suggests, if not for a crucial step in human evolution. &nbsp;</p>



<p>It’s what we’re missing that makes the difference. Humans have <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/engineered-vocal-cords-show-promise-animal-tests">vocal cords</a>, muscles in our larynx, or voice box, that vibrate to produce sound (<em>SN: 11/18/15</em>). But unlike all other studied primates, humans don’t have small bits of tissue above the vocal cords called vocal membranes. That uniquely human trait helps people <a href="https://doi.org/10.1126/science.abm1574">control their voices well enough</a> to produce the sounds that are the building blocks of spoken language, researchers report in the Aug. 12 <em>Science.</em></p>





<p>Vocal membranes act like a reed in a clarinet, making it easier for some animals to shout loud and shrill. Think of the <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/blog/science-ticker/howler-monkeys-sacrifice-sperm-deeper-roars">piercing calls of howler monkeys</a> (<em>SN: 10/22/15</em>). When researchers used MRI and CT scans to look for vocal membranes in 43 different primate species, the scientists were surprised by what they saw: All primates except humans had the tissue.&nbsp;</p>



<p>That loss of vocal membranes would have been a “very major, very revolutionary event in human evolution,” says Takeshi Nishimura, a paleontologist at Kyoto University in Japan.&nbsp;</p>

Dunn</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>Primates mostly make sound in the same basic way: They push air out from their lungs while vibrating muscles in the larynx to create sound waves. To understand the role that vocal membranes play, Nishimura’s team studied videos of primate voice boxes in action in chimpanzees, rhesus macaques and squirrel monkeys. The researchers also took larynges from macaques and chimpanzees that had died of natural causes and — in what’s common practice for the field — mounted the parts on tubes, pushing air through the larynges to see how the vocal cords and membranes would react.</p>



<p>In both experiments, the larynges made sounds that would often fluctuate wildly in pitch. Nishimura’s team found that happens only when an animal has both vocal membranes and vocal cords.</p>





<p>In humans, that sort of screeching can happen when we put extreme amounts of pressure on our voice, like when we scream — or when teens struggle with controlling their growing vocal cords and their voices crack.&nbsp;But those are rare cases. Since humans don’t have vocal membranes, we usually make more stable sounds than other primates, the team concludes. Our mouths and tongues, the idea goes, can then manipulate those stable tones into the complex sounds that language is based on.</p>



<p>“That’s a really elegant explanation,” says Sue Anne Zollinger, an animal physiologist at Manchester Metropolitan University in England who was not involved in the study. It’s almost counterintuitive, she says: “You lose complexity to be able to produce more complex sounds.”</p>



<p>The loss of vocal membranes isn’t the only thing that makes humans more eloquent than other primates. Beyond anatomical differences, humans have <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/language-gene-foxp2-no-humans-evolution-boost">specific genes</a> that may have helped drive language evolution (<em>SN: 8/3/18</em>). And perhaps most importantly, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/monkeys-have-vocal-tools-not-brains-talk-humans">human brains are structured differently</a> from other primates in ways that also give us more control over our speech (<em>SN: 12/19/16</em>).</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/arctic-warming-faster-earth-climate-change">The Arctic is warming even faster than scientists realized</a></h4>

              
                <p>The Arctic is heating up at a breakneck speed compared with the rest of Earth. And new analyses show that the region is warming even faster than scientists thought. Over the last four decades, the average Arctic temperature increased <a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s43247-022-00498-3">nearly four times as fast as the global average</a>, researchers report August 11 in <em>Communications Earth &amp; Environment</em>.</p>



<p>And that’s just on average. Some parts of the Arctic Ocean, such as the Barents Sea between Russia and Norway’s Svalbard archipelago, are warming as much as seven times as fast, meteorologist Mika Rantanen of the Finnish Meteorological Institute in Helsinki and colleagues found. Previous studies have tended to say that the Arctic’s average temperature is increasing two to three times as fast as elsewhere, as humans continue causing the climate to change.</p>





<p>To calculate the true pace of the accelerated warming, a phenomenon called <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/climate-new-high-temperature-heat-record-arctic-siberia-context">Arctic amplification</a>, the researchers analyzed observational data from 1979 to 2021 (<em>SN: 7/1/20</em>). Globally, the average temperature increase over that time was about 0.2 degrees Celsius per decade. But the Arctic was warming by about 0.75 degrees C per decade.</p>

<h3>Heating up</h3>



<p>Over the last four decades, the global average temperature increased by about 0.2 degrees Celsius per decade, but in the Arctic, the mean increase per decade was about 0.75 degrees Celsius (left). Comparing the two trends, Arctic temperatures increased on average four times as fast as the global average, with some areas increasing as much as seven times as fast (right). The gray dotted line indicates the border of the Arctic Circle.</p>

<p>Even the best climate models are not doing a great job of reproducing that warming, Rantanen and colleagues say. The inability of the models to realistically simulate past Arctic amplification calls into question how well the models can project future changes there.</p>



<p>It’s not clear where the problem lies. One issue may be that the models are struggling with correctly simulating the sensitivity of Arctic temperatures to the loss of sea ice. Vanishing snow and ice, particularly sea ice, are one big reason why Arctic warming is on hyperspeed. The bright white snow and ice create a reflective shield that bounces incoming radiation from the sun back into space. But open ocean waters or bare rocks absorb that heat, raising the temperature.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/multiple-sclerosis-epstein-barr-virus-vaccines-treatments">Multiple sclerosis has a common viral culprit, opening doors to new approaches</a></h4>

              
                <p class="has-drop-cap" style="font-size:20px">As Tanina Agosto went through her normal morning routine in July 2007, she realized something was wrong. The 29-year-old couldn’t control her left side, even her face. “Literally the top of my head to the bottom of my foot on the left side of my body could not feel anything.”</p>



<p>The next day, Agosto spoke with a doctor at the New York City hospital where she works as a medical secretary. He told her that she probably had a pinched nerve and to see a chiropractor.</p>





<p>But chiropractic care didn’t help. Months later, Agosto needed a cane to get around, and moving her left leg and arm required lots of concentration. She couldn’t work. Numbness and tingling made cooking and cleaning difficult. It felt a bit like looping a rubber band tightly around a finger until it loses sensation, Agosto says. Once the rubber band comes off, the finger tingles for a bit. But for her, the tingling wouldn’t stop.</p>



<p>Finally, she recalls, one chiropractor told her, “I’m not too big of a person to say there’s something very wrong with you, and I don’t know what it is. You need to see a neurologist.” In November 2008, tests confirmed that Agosto had multiple sclerosis. Her immune system was attacking her brain and spinal cord.</p>



<p>Agosto knew nothing about MS except that a friend of her mother’s had it. “At the time, I was like, there’s no way I’ve got this old lady’s condition,” she says. “To be hit with that and know that there’s no cure — that was just devastating.”</p>



<p>Why people develop the autoimmune disorder has been a long-standing question. Studies have pointed to certain gene variations and environmental factors. For decades, a common virus called Epstein-Barr virus has also been high on the list of culprits.</p>



<p>Now recent studies paint a clearer picture that Epstein-Barr virus instigates MS when the central nervous system gets caught in the cross hairs of an immune response to the virus’s attack. This recognition opens new options for treatment, or even vaccines. Perhaps therapies that target Epstein-Barr itself — or remove the cells in the body where the virus camps out — could jettison the virus before damage is done.</p>

<p>Vaccines might one day “make multiple sclerosis become a historical disease like polio,” says Lawrence Steinman, a neurologist at Stanford University. “The trials will be arduous,” Steinman says. Still, “I think we might be able to put MS in the rearview mirror.”</p>



<p>For now, there’s a lot to learn, including how exactly the virus triggers MS, says Francesca Aloisi, a neuroscientist at the Italian National Institute of Health in Rome.</p>



<p>For many people with MS, even with current therapies, the disease can progress. Right now, Agosto’s symptoms are largely under control. Thanks to physical therapy, an anti-inflammatory diet and medication, she has about 90 percent function on the left side of her body. “Things like long-distance running are out of the question,” she says. Carrying grocery bags with her left arm is a challenge.</p>



<p>Studying the virus’s role in MS “will be an amazing game changer,” says Agosto, who is a patient advocate with the National Multiple Sclerosis Society’s New York City chapter. If Epstein-Barr virus is driving her disease, she wants to know: “How do we get this virus out of the driver’s seat?”</p>



<h4>A familiar virus</h4>



<p>Multiple sclerosis is an uncommon disease, affecting nearly 3 million people globally. Yet Epstein-Barr virus is almost everywhere.</p>



<p>The virus, discovered in 1964, infects an estimated 90 percent of people around the world. People infected as young children might have a mild cold or show no symptoms. Teenagers or young adults may experience a bout of debilitating fatigue called infectious mononucleosis, or mono, that can last weeks or months.</p>



<p>These symptoms eventually fade. But Epstein-Barr infections hang on. The virus belongs to the herpesvirus family — a group known for instigating lifelong infections. The herpesviruses behind cold sores, genital herpes and chicken pox also stick around for life, usually staying quiet for long stretches. For example, varicella-zoster virus, which causes chicken pox, goes latent inside nerve cells but can resurface to <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/shingles-virus-rash-chicken-pox-complications">cause the painful disease shingles</a> (<em>SN: 3/2/19, p. 22</em>).</p>



<p>In the body, Epstein-Barr virus slips into the epithelial cells that line the surface of the throat, allowing the virus to spread to other people via saliva — hence mono’s nickname, “the kissing disease.” The virus also infects a type of immune cell called B cells, where it enters viral hibernation.</p>



<p>Epstein-Barr virus can cause problems long after the initial infection. People who had mono are more likely to develop cancers such as Hodgkin’s lymphoma than people who didn’t. And they are more likely to be diagnosed with MS. A teenage case of mono doesn’t mean long-term problems are inevitable. But avoiding mono-related fatigue doesn’t guarantee an escape from risk either. Agosto, for instance, doesn’t recall ever having mono.</p>



<div class="wp-block-sciencenews-content-sidebar">
<h3>Lifelong infection</h3>



<p>Epstein-Barr virus infects the throat’s epithelial cells and the immune system’s B cells. Inside B cells, the virus can hibernate for long stretches of time — sometimes reemerging and doing new damage.</p>

<p>In March 2000, epidemiologist Alberto Ascherio of the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health published research exploring the link between Epstein-Barr virus and MS. With colleague Mette Munch of the University of Aarhus in Denmark, Ascherio analyzed data from eight studies suggesting that MS patients are more likely to have had an Epstein-Barr infection than those without MS. Studies over the next 20 years continued to hint that the virus plays a role, but “the problem is to go from a suggestion or suspicion to proof,” says Ascherio. Getting that proof is difficult, because nearly everyone has been infected with Epstein-Barr virus, or EBV, yet very few have MS.</p>



<p>“If it’s true that EBV causes MS, then you would expect to find that those individuals who are not infected with EBV, they will not get MS,” Ascherio says. “It’s very simple.” He and colleagues needed to follow a large group of young adults who had never been infected.</p>



<p>The researchers found such a group in the U.S. military. Through the Department of Defense Serum Repository, the team had access to repeated blood samples from more than 10 million individuals, taken when active-duty members were screened for diseases such as HIV at the start of their service and then every two years. Using blood samples taken between 1993 and 2013, Ascherio and colleagues could identify people who had never been infected with Epstein-Barr virus, track new infections and learn when people who developed MS started showing symptoms.</p>



<p>Over that 20-year span, 801 people whose blood was tested were diagnosed with MS. Thirty-five of those people had no signs of Epstein-Barr virus infection in their first blood sample. But all but one became infected before their MS diagnosis. People <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.abj8222">infected with the virus were 32 times as likely to develop MS</a> as uninfected people. What’s more, the researchers found that blood concentrations of a nervous system protein that is a signal of nerve damage rose after Epstein-Barr virus infection, before an MS diagnosis. The results prompted Ascherio and his team to make a bold claim in <em>Science</em> in January: “These findings cannot be explained by any known risk factor for MS and suggest EBV as the leading cause of MS.”</p>



<p>It is still possible that infection with Epstein-Barr virus is a time stamp for something else, perhaps not yet identified, that’s also relevant for MS, says Mark Allegretta, vice president of research at the National Multiple Sclerosis Society. “The way we talk about it now is that it’s very strong evidence that it’s necessary for development of MS, but it’s insufficient on its own.”</p>



<p>Ascherio isn’t deterred. “After 20 years of talking about EBV and MS, it’s quite exciting that we’ve finally nailed it down,” he says. “There was a lot of skepticism until now and that is fading away.”</p>

<h4>A skeptic convinced</h4>



<p>The fact that Epstein-Barr virus is implicated in so many diseases had many researchers skeptical of its link to MS, says Tobias Lanz, a neurologist at Stanford University. “It’s involved in tumors, it’s involved in MS, it’s involved in lupus, it’s in chronic fatigue syndrome. Somehow, people link it to everything and that makes us reasonably suspicious.”</p>



<p>Lanz’s mentor, Stanford rheumatologist William Robinson, was one of those skeptics. Once Lanz, Robinson and their colleagues found hints of how Epstein-Barr virus could spark nerve damage, however, Robinson became a believer.</p>



<p>The team discovered that immune proteins called antibodies from some MS patients <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-022-04432-7">attach to a key Epstein-Barr virus protein</a>, as well as to a protein from the central nervous system. This finding, described in the March 10 <em>Nature</em>, suggests that as the immune system learns how to recognize the virus, it may also learn to attack nerve cells.</p>



<p>The viral protein, called EBNA1, helps Epstein-Barr virus persist in the body for life, hidden away inside B cells. Its molecular twin in the central nervous system, a portion of a protein called GlialCAM, is so similar that antibodies for the virus recognize and bind tightly to it too, the team found in lab experiments.</p>



<p>“That really changed everything,” Robinson says, calling it “an in-your-face result that you can’t dismiss as not being real.” In addition to adding to the evidence that Epstein-Barr virus causes MS, the finding also provides a hint of a possible mechanism: <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/rethinking-which-cells-are-conductors-learning-and-memory">GlialCAM is found in glial cells</a>, which support nerve cells and form the insulating layer myelin that helps nerve cells send signals (<em>SN: 8/22/15, p. 18</em>). Myelin is the very thing that is destroyed in MS.</p>



<p>About a quarter of patients in the study had antibodies that recognize both EBNA1 and GlialCAM. The similarities between the two proteins, called molecular mimicry, means that EBNA1 may not be a good viral protein to include in vaccines to curb diseases related to Epstein-Barr virus, says Steinman, the Stanford neurologist, who was also involved with the research. If the virus indeed sparks an autoimmune reaction, vaccines that target this viral protein or other mimics could harm myelin and spur MS.</p>

<h3>Molecular mimic &nbsp;</h3>



<p>As the body mounts an attack against Epstein-Barr virus, the immune system may learn to turn against nerve cells too. Some researchers hypothesize that virus-attacking antibodies might also attack nerve-protecting myelin and drive MS.</p>

<h4>Viral damage</h4>



<p>Several studies support the idea that <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17531840/#:~:text=Molecular%20mimicry%20occurs%20when%20peptides,one%20specific%20virus%20to%20MS.">molecular mimicry causes MS damag</a>e. But other hypotheses are on the table.</p>



<p>Those B cells, for instance, where Epstein-Barr viruses hide out, produce antibodies. One possibility is that B cells infected with Epstein-Barr virus transform in ways that encourage the immune system to attack the body’s own tissues.</p>



<p>Aloisi, the neuroscientist in Rome, backs a different hypothesis: Perhaps the immune system’s attack on the virus itself is behind the damage.</p>



<p>“The biology of the virus is so similar to the biology of the disease,” Aloisi says. For some people, MS can go through phases of silence where the disease is stable, no better, no worse. The disease then reactivates, producing new brain lesions and worsening symptoms. Epstein-Barr virus can similarly come out of latency, perhaps causing a surge of problems before returning to hibernation inside host cells.</p>



<p>In 2007, Aloisi and colleagues discovered unexpected <a href="https://rupress.org/jem/article/204/12/2899/46593/Dysregulated-Epstein-Barr-virus-infection-in-the">clusters of B cells within the membranes that cover and protect the brain</a>. In all but one of 22 patients studied, some of those B cells were infected with Epstein-Barr virus.</p>



<p>The finding “was like a bomb in the field,” Aloisi says, “because nobody ever thought about this possibility.” Other researchers initially failed to replicate the results. But “little by little other work came out [in support],” she says. “It’s difficult to find these [clusters of B cells] in the brain because people with MS don’t have large, inflamed brains. It’s small spots here and there.”</p>



<p>It’s possible that the central nervous system becomes a stronghold for the virus, Aloisi says. Immune cells called T cells, which can either coordinate an attack or kill infected cells, rush in. Some virus-infected B cells die, but the immune system can’t eliminate the virus. Myelin gets caught in the cross fire. “This creates a situation that is extremely detrimental to the tissue,” she says.</p>





<h4>Treatment tactics</h4>



<p>Regardless of whether Epstein-Barr virus drives MS symptoms directly or causes the body’s immune response to go haywire, the big question is what to do about it.</p>



<p>One obvious path is to develop MS drugs that go after the virus, Aloisi says. Some drugs that block hepatitis B virus and HIV have shown <a href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2002392117">potential against Epstein-Barr virus in lab-grown cells</a>, says Ascherio, the Harvard epidemiologist. But those results are very preliminary.</p>



<p>Another option is to go after the infected cells. A few MS therapies may do that already. The existing MS therapy natalizumab already prevents B and T cells from crossing into the central nervous system. Fingolimod may do that as well. Another drug called ocrelizumab, approved for patients with MS in 2017, is an antibody that attaches to a protein on B cells and triggers cell death. The drug helps patients, like Agosto, who have relapsing-remitting MS, but it’s less effective for people with a progressive form of the disease, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/scientists-are-seeking-new-strategies-fight-multiple-sclerosis">who have fewer treatment options</a> (<em>SN: 12/9/17, p. 20</em>).</p>



<p>Researchers thought the drug dampened faulty immune responses by depleting B cells, Lanz says. “But it could also well be that we’re hitting those particular pathogenic B cells that are infected with Epstein-Barr virus. So the B cell depletion might actually be an anti-EBV drug and nobody appreciated that.”</p>



<p>Aloisi agrees. “Now we need something that targets the EBV-infected cells, not all of the B cells,” she says. Indiscriminately killing B cells puts patients at risk for other infections. One way to get around that could come in the form of T cell therapies that go after only infected cells. Such therapies are already in clinical trials in MS patients.</p>



<p>Some researchers suspect that antiviral treatments would probably make the most sense when used early on, before the immune system eats away at the myelin around the nerve cells. Once the virus has kick-started an immune response to attack the nervous system, “the train may already be out of the station,” says neuroimmunologist Emily Harrington of Ohio State University’s Wexner Medical Center in Columbus.</p>



<h4>A vaccine</h4>



<p>Even better than stopping the infection once it starts would be to build defenses before the virus invades, or to stop it from reawakening. Enter vaccines.</p>



<p>The widespread impact of mono and Epstein-Barr virus’s links to cancer and autoimmune disease had already spurred vaccine research, so a few potential shots are already in the pipeline. But Epstein-Barr virus has a complex way of invading the body, says vaccinologist Javier Gordon Ogembo of City of Hope, a cancer care center in Duarte, Calif. The virus uses at least five viral proteins to invade both epithelial cells and B cells. A vaccine would need to drive an immune response that blocks the virus’s entry into both cell types to prevent infection. “This is the reason, I think, why there has not been a vaccine so far,” Ogembo says.</p>



<div class="wp-block-sciencenews-content-sidebar alignright">
<h3>Vaccine options</h3>



<p>Recent studies suggest that vaccines being developed to prevent diseases related to Epstein-Barr virus, or EBV, such as mononucleosis or cancer, might also work for multiple sclerosis.&nbsp;</p>



<h6>Moderna mRNA vaccine: </h6>



<p>Uses mRNA to teach the body to recognize four viral proteins that help EBV enter epithelial and B cells. <br><strong>Developed for:</strong> Mononucleosis <br><strong>Stage of development: </strong>Phase I clinical trial</p>



<h6>NIH nanoparticles vaccine: </h6>



<p>Teaches the body to attack a protein called gp350, which EBV uses to infect B cells<br><strong>Developed for:</strong> Mono and cancer<br><strong>Stage of development: </strong>Phase I clinical trial</p>



<h6>City of Hope modified virus vaccine: </h6>



<p>Delivers DNA to cells so the cells can make and teach the immune system to recognize five viral proteins that help EBV enter epithelial and B cells<br><strong>Developed for:</strong> Mono and cancer<br><strong>Stage of development: </strong>Animal studies</p>



<h6>BioNTech mRNA vaccine:</h6>



<p>Blocks myelin attack<br><strong>Developed for:</strong> MS<br><strong>Stage of development: </strong>Animal studies</p>
</div>



<p>Pharmaceutical company GlaxoSmithKline took one vaccine candidate to clinical trials in the early 2000s. It seemed to stop people from developing mono, but it didn’t meet the original goal of preventing infection overall. So the company abandoned the vaccine.</p>



<p>Moderna, the biotechnology company made famous for its effective COVID-19 vaccine, recently launched a clinical trial of an mRNA vaccine for Epstein-Barr virus. The shot teaches the body to recognize four of the five viral proteins that help the virus invade both cell types, says viral immunologist Katherine Luzuriaga of the University of Massachusetts Chan Medical School in Worcester, who is involved in the trial. For now, the team is testing whether the vaccine sparks a strong immune response and getting a sense for whether it might curb cases of mono.</p>



<p>In March, the U.S National Institutes of Health <a href="https://www.nih.gov/news-events/news-releases/nih-launches-clinical-trial-epstein-barr-virus-vaccine">launched a clinical trial to test a vaccine</a> that uses nanoparticles to teach the body to recognize the virus and get rid of it. Ogembo and colleagues at City of Hope are developing another vaccine that uses a modified virus as the immune system’s instructor.</p>



<p>Although clinical trials could reveal within the next few years whether the vaccines can control mono, it will be decades before researchers learn anything about the potential impact on cancer or MS, Luzuriaga and Ogembo say. The hope is to see an outcome like the vaccines for human papilloma­viruses, Luzuriaga says, which reduce the number of HPV infections and led to a dramatic reduction in cervical cancers.</p>



<p>Developing therapeutic vaccines for people who already have MS may also be possible, Ascherio says. The aim would be to stop the virus from emerging from its slumber inside B cells. It would be akin to the shingles vaccine, which prevents the painful reactivation of varicella-zoster virus in nerve cells.</p>



<p>That is Steinman’s aim as well, but he envisions a shot that would put a check on the undesirable immune response. Steinman and colleagues have tested such a vaccine to try and teach MS patients’ immune systems to ignore and not harm a protein called myelin basic protein, which helps add myelin to nerves. There were hints the vaccine might have been effective, but the team ultimately stopped the project.</p>



<p>“If it weren’t for other very powerful therapies becoming approved in that same time frame, we may have continued,” Steinman says. Now, he wants to make a vaccine that helps MS patients tolerate, rather than attack, the central nervous system protein GlialCAM.</p>



<p>Researchers at BioNTech, also famous for developing a COVID-19 vaccine, are working on something similar. In mice with a disease close to MS, the company showed that an mRNA vaccine <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.aay3638?url_ver=Z39.88-2003">could keep the immune system from attacking myelin proteins</a>, the team reported in January 2021 in <em>Science</em>.</p>



<p>Time will tell how effective any of these shots might be. But with studies providing more and more evidence that Epstein-Barr virus is linked to many diseases, Ogembo says, “it’s time to make a vaccine and get rid of it.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/zoo-gorilla-new-vocalization-call-cough-sound-human-attention">Zoo gorillas use a weird new call that sounds like a sneezy cough</a></h4>

              
                <p>Sukari the gorilla can grunt. She can hum. She can grumble. Now, scientists report, the gorilla’s got a new way to express herself. Sukari can “snough.”</p>



<p>She and other zoo gorillas make the noise, a cross between a sneeze and a cough, when zookeepers with food are near. The unusual utterance, which has not been observed in the wild and never been described before in this species, can help the gorillas grab people’s attention, says primatologist Roberta Salmi of the University of Georgia in Athens. The snough adds to the small but growing pile of evidence that <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0271871">captive apes can produce novel vocal sounds</a>, Salmi and her colleagues report August 10 in <em>PLOS ONE</em>.</p>





<p>Salmi first encountered the snough years ago at Zoo Atlanta, when she and a zookeeper noticed the gorillas making a strange sound. “We actually laughed,” she recalls. Gorillas utter an assortment of calls, but the snough stood out. As the animals wheeze out the noise, they open their mouths wide, almost as if they’re preparing to yodel. “It’s very theatrical,” Salmi says. And it seemed to crop up only in a specific situation — when keepers showed up with food.</p>



<p>Salmi and her colleagues wondered if the animals snoughed at other times too. So they recorded eight western lowland gorillas at Zoo Atlanta in three different scenarios: when a bucket of fresh grapes, a keeper or a keeper holding the grapes sat outside the enclosure. Gorillas snoughed most when both the keeper and the food sat nearby, the team found. And they made other noises that can draw human attention, like clapping, chest-beating or banging on the enclosure. When the gorillas saw just grapes or just the keeper, they stayed mostly silent.</p>

</div><figcaption>In an enclosure at Zoo Atlanta, Sukari the gorilla makes a call that sounds something like a sneeze and a cough — a “snough.” Sukari and other zoo gorillas used the sound most often when zookeepers with food were near. </figcaption></figure>



<p>“That’s quite decent evidence of the animals’ intention to request something from the keeper,” says Zanna Clay, a primatologist at Durham University in England who was not involved with the work.</p>



<p>And the snoughing wasn’t limited to Zoo Atlanta gorillas. Surveys from 19 zoos across the United States and Canada revealed that other gorillas make the same snuffling sound. Those animals probably didn’t learn to snough from the Zoo Atlanta gorillas, because they’ve never been exposed to one another, Salmi says.</p>



<p>At this point, her team can only speculate how the snough originated, though she notes that a sneezy cough might work particularly well to snare a keeper’s notice. “Coughing and sneezing are signs of a cold, which are signals that caregivers pay specific attention to,” she says.</p>



<p>If the gorillas want something they can’t physically reach, they may be “trying to use communicative signals to manipulate humans” into helping, says Jared Taglialatela, an evolutionary biologist at Kennesaw State University in Georgia who was not involved with the study.</p>



<p>To date, most research on great apes’ vocal repertoires has been limited to gorillas’ charismatic cousins. Chimpanzees in captivity can blow “raspberries” and orangutans can whistle, but gorillas’ calls aren’t as well-studied. “There’s a bit of a gap in our understanding,” Taglialatela says. If chimpanzees, orangutans and now gorillas can all create novel vocalizations, an ability present in humans but rare across the animal kingdom, it’s possible that the ancestor of these animals and humans did as well, he says.</p>



<p>Clay thinks that studying gorillas might offer new clues about what drives language development. A snough is not the same as speech, she points out, but it could be a sign that there’s more to gorillas than meets the ear.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/sea-sponge-snot-rocket-mucus-pore">Sea sponges launch slow-motion snot rockets to clean their pores</a></h4>

              
                <p>The next time you spot a sea sponge, say “gesundheit!” Some sponges regularly “sneeze” to clear debris<strong> </strong>from their porous bodies.</p>



<p>As filter feeders, sponges draw in water through inlet pores — called ostia — and strain it through an internal&nbsp;canal system for nutrients. But there are also inedible bits in the water, like sediment. To prevent the undesirable junk from clogging up their outer pores, a Caribbean tube sponge (<em>Aplysina archeri</em>)<a href="https://www.cell.com/current-biology/fulltext/S0960-9822(22)01118-6"> uses mucus to trap and sneeze out unwanted particles</a>, Niklas Kornder, a marine biologist at the University of Amsterdam, and colleagues report online August 10 in <em>Current Biology</em>. To the team’s surprise, it found that the sponge expels its snot from the same pores through which it absorbs water.</p>





<p>It’s “like someone with a runny nose,” says team member Sally Leys, an evolutionary biologist at the University of Alberta in Edmonton, Canada. “It&#8217;s constantly streaming, but it&#8217;s going counterflow to the in-current.”</p>



<p>Researchers knew that sponges used contractions dubbed “sneezing” to move water through their bodies in a one-way flow. Typically, water comes in through numerous ostia and leaves through the osculum, a hole near the sponges’ top.</p>



<p>But when the team captured time-lapse video of <em>A. archeri</em>, it saw tiny specks of mucus exiting from the ostia, moving against the flow of incoming water. Sneezelike contractions appeared to expel and move the specks along a “mucus highway” across the surface of the sponge to points where they collected in stringy, gooey clumps. Unlike an explosive human sneeze, the sponges slowly and continuously secreted debris-laden mucus from their ostia, with one contraction taking between 20 and 50 minutes, the study finds.</p>

</div><figcaption>The Caribbean tube sponge (<em>Aplysina archeri</em>) uses contractions — called &#8220;sneezes&#8221; — to help eject mucus from its pores, or ostia. As the time-lapse video zooms in closer, it’s possible to see tiny specks of debris floating out of these pores and traveling along a “mucus highway” where they collect into stringy clumps of goo floating above the surface of the sponge. In real time, this sponge takes between 20 and 50 minutes to complete a sneeze.</figcaption></figure>



<p>Other sea critters feast on these ocean boogers, like brittle stars and small crustaceans. Scientists view sponges primarily as habitat builders, but the mucus buffet shows they also perform an important function as food providers, says Amanda Kahn, a marine biologist at Moss Landing Marine Labs in California who was not involved with this work.</p>



<p>“There&#8217;s so much to be said for a study that really spends time and watches,” Kahn says. “They let the animals show for themselves what was happening.”</p>



<p>Most sponges appear to sneeze, so it’s likely not just <em>A. archeri</em> that uses the counterflow technique, Leys says.&nbsp;The team also noted a similar behavior in an Indo-Pacific sponge (<em>Chelonaplysilla</em> sp). But biologists need to dig deeper to figure out how widespread the mechanism is. It’s also unclear exactly what the mucus is or how it’s moving backward through pores.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/balloons-earthquake-detection-venus-geology">How balloons could one day detect quakes on Venus</a></h4>

              
                <p>The balloon was floating over the Pacific Ocean when the first sound waves hit. For 11 seconds, a tiny device dangling beneath the large, transparent balloon recorded sudden, jerky fluctuations in air pressure: echoes of an earthquake more than 2,800 kilometers away.</p>



<p>That scientific instrument was one of four hovering high above the Malay Archipelago on December 14, 2021. That day the quartet became <a href="https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1029/2022GL098844">the first network of devices to monitor an earthquake from the air</a>, researchers report in the Aug. 16 <em>Geophysical Research Letters</em>.</p>





<p>The finding could help scientists track earthquakes in remote areas on Earth, and also opens the door to one day sending specially equipped balloons to study the geology of other worlds, including our closest planetary neighbor.</p>



<p>“Venus is the sister planet of Earth, but it’s the evil twin sister,” says David Mimoun, a planetary scientist at the University of Toulouse in France. “We don’t know why the two planets are so different. That’s why we need measurements.”</p>



<p>The idea of using balloons to study far-off rumblings on Earth has its roots in the Cold War. In the 1940s, the U.S. military launched a top secret project to spy on Soviet nuclear weapons testing using microphones attached to balloons floating high in the atmosphere. When the ground shakes, it releases low-frequency sound waves that can travel long distances in the atmosphere. The military planned on using the microphones to pick up on the sound of the ground shaking from a nuclear explosion. But the project was eventually deemed too expensive and dropped — though not before one of the balloons crashed in New Mexico, launching the Roswell conspiracy.</p>



<p>For decades after, balloon science stayed mostly in the realm of meteorology. Then in the early 2000s, Mimoun and his colleagues started experimenting with using balloons for space exploration, specifically for studying extraterrestrial quakes.</p>



<p>Analyzing temblors is one of the main ways that scientists can learn about a planet’s interior. On worlds with thin atmospheres, such as Mars or Earth’s moon, this generally means sending a lander to the surface and <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/nasa-insight-lander-mars-marsquake">measuring quakes directly on the ground</a> (<em>SN: 5/13/22</em>).</p>



<p>But doing that on Venus isn’t really an option. The dense atmosphere means that the planet’s surface has about the same pressure as Earth’s deep ocean, with temperatures averaging around 450° Celsius — hot enough to melt lead. “Basically, it’s hell,” Mimoun says.</p>



<p>Landers have made it to the <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/unveiling-venus-hot-and-stifling">surface of Venus</a> before (<em>SN: 6/19/76</em>). But these probes lasted only a few hours before succumbing to the extreme heat and pressure. The chances of measuring a quake in that short time frame are slim, says Siddharth Krishnamoorthy, a research technologist at NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, Calif., who wasn’t involved in the study. So while radar images of Venus have revealed a world dotted with volcanoes, scientists still don’t know for sure if Venus is geologically active, he says.</p>



<p>Scientists have previously experimented with the idea of <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/satellites-could-detect-quakes-venus">detecting quakes on Venus using orbiters</a> (<em>SN: 9/02/05</em>). But quake-detecting balloons have better resolution, says Mimoun, meaning they could provide the key to revealing the planet’s interior life. But first Mimoun and his colleagues had to show that they could design devices small enough to be carried by balloons but sensitive enough to pick up earthquakes far below.</p>



<p>In 2021, the team attached micro-barometers to 16 balloons launched from the Seychelles Islands, off the coast of East Africa. In December, four balloons — having drifted thousands of kilometers apart — recorded similar, low-frequency sound waves. These changes in air pressure resembled ground readings of a 7.3 magnitude earthquake near the Indonesian island of Flores, indicating that the sound waves were produced by the earthquake. The researchers were able to use the changes in air pressure to pinpoint the epicenter of the quake and calculate its magnitude.</p>

<p>On December 14, 2021, a 7.3 magnitude earthquake originated in Indonesia’s Flores Sea. High in the atmosphere, four balloons with barometers detected changes in air pressure that resembled ground readings of the quake. The quartet is the first network of devices to monitor an earthquake from the air.</p>

<p>“This is a huge step forward in demonstrating the utility of this technology,” says Paul Byrne, a planetary scientist at Washington University in St. Louis, who was not involved with the study.</p>



<p>Even without being able to pick up quakes, the balloons, if designed to survive in the Venusian atmosphere, might be able to detect changes in air pressure that reveal clues about the planet’s volcanic eruptions and mysterious highlands, Byrne says.</p>



<p>Venus is entering a renaissance of interest from space agencies. <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/nasa-venus-mission-davinci-veritas-space-planetary-science">At least two NASA missions to visit the planet are planned</a> for the end of this decade (<em>SN: 6/2/21</em>). Mimoun is hoping that earthquake-detecting balloons will feature in the next major mission, emphasizing that their data could help researchers understand why Earth and Venus — alike in size and distance from the sun, relative to the other planets — have gone down such different paths.</p>



<p>&nbsp;“We have no clue,” Mimoun says. “So we need to go back.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/beaver-relocation-climate-change-dam-stream">Relocated beavers helped mitigate some effects of climate change</a></h4>

              
                <p>In the upper reaches of the Skykomish River in Washington state, a pioneering team of civil engineers is keeping things cool. Relocated beavers boosted water storage and lowered stream temperatures, indicating such schemes could be an effective tool to mitigate some of the effects of climate change.</p>



<p>In just one year after their arrival, the new recruits <a href="https://esajournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/ecs2.4168">brought average water temperatures down by about 2 degrees Celsius</a> and raised water tables as much as about 30 centimeters, researchers report in the July <em>Ecosphere.</em> While researchers have discussed <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/stream-survival-beaver-dam-simple-structures-wildfires-drought">beaver dams as a means to restore streams and bulk up groundwater</a>, the effects following a large, targeted relocation had been relatively unknown (<em>SN: 3/26/21</em>).</p>





<p>“That water storage is so critical during the drier periods, because that&#8217;s what can keep the ecosystem resilient to droughts and fires,” says Emily Fairfax, an ecohydrologist at California State University Channel Islands in Camarillo who was not involved with the study.</p>



<p>The Skykomish River flows down the west side of Washington’s Cascade Mountains. Climate change is already transforming the region’s hydrology: The snowpack is shrinking, and snowfall is turning to rain, which drains quickly. Waters are also warming, which is bad news for salmon populations that struggle to survive in hot water.</p>



<p>Beavers are known <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/got-environmental-problem-beavers-could-be-solution">to tinker with hydrology too</a> (<em>SN: 7/27/18</em>). They build dams, ponds and wetlands, deepening streams for their burrows and lodges (complete with underwater entrances). The dams slow the water, storing it upstream for longer, and cool it as it flows through the ground underneath.</p>



<p>From 2014 to 2016, aquatic ecologist Benjamin Dittbrenner and colleagues relocated 69 beavers (<em>Castor canadensis</em>) from lowland areas of the state to 13 upstream sites in the Skykomish River basin, some with relic beaver ponds and others untouched. As beavers are family-oriented, the team moved whole clans to increase the chances that they would stay put.</p>



<p>The researchers also matched singletons up with potential mates, which seemed to work well: “They were not picky at all,” says Dittbrenner, of Northeastern University in Boston. Fresh logs and wood cuttings got the beavers started in their new neighborhoods.</p>



<p>At the five sites that saw long-term construction, beavers built 14 dams. Thanks to those dams, the volume of surface water — streams, ponds, wetlands — increased to about 20 times that of streams with no new beaver activity. Meanwhile below ground, wells at three sites showed that after dam construction the amount of groundwater grew to more than twice that was stored on the surface in ponds. Stream temperatures downstream of the dams fell by 2.3 degrees C on average, while streams not subject to the beavers’ tinkering warmed by 0.8 degrees C. These changes all came within the first year after relocation.</p>



<p>“We&#8217;re achieving restoration objectives almost instantly, which is really cool,” Dittbrenner says.</p>



<p>Crucially, the dams lowered temperatures enough to almost completely take the streams out of the harmful range for salmon during a particularly hot summer. “These fish are also experiencing heat waves within the water system, and the beavers are protecting them from it,” Fairfax says. “That to me was huge.”</p>



<p>The study also found that small, shallow abandoned beaver ponds were actually warming streams, perhaps because the cooling system had broken down over time. Targeting these ponds as potential relocation sites could be the most effective way to bring temperatures down, the researchers say. &nbsp;When relocated populations establish and breed, young beavers leaving their homes could seek those abandoned spots out first, Dittbrenner says, as it uses less energy than starting from scratch. “If they find a relic pond, it&#8217;s game on.”&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/dark-matter-map-galaxies-early-universe">Scientists mapped dark matter around galaxies in the early universe</a></h4>

              
                <p>Scientists have mapped out the dark matter around some of the earliest, most distant galaxies yet.</p>



<p>The 1.5 million galaxies appear as they were 12 billion years ago, or less than 2 billion years after the Big Bang. Those galaxies distort the cosmic microwave background — light emitted during an even earlier era of the universe — as seen from Earth. That distortion, called gravitational lensing, reveals the <a href="https://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.129.061301">distribution of dark matter</a> around those galaxies, scientists report in the Aug. 5 <em>Physical Review Letters</em>.</p>





<p>Understanding how dark matter collects around galaxies early in the universe’s history could tell scientists more about the mysterious substance. And in the future, this lensing technique could also help scientists unravel a mystery about how matter clumps together in the universe.</p>



<p>Dark matter is an unknown, massive substance that surrounds galaxies. Scientists have <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/xenonnt-axions-dark-matter-experiment">never directly detected dark matter</a>, but they can observe its gravitational effects on the cosmos (<em>SN: 7/22/22</em>). One of those effects is gravitational lensing: When light passes by a galaxy, its mass bends the light like a lens. How much the light bends reveals the mass of the galaxy, including its dark matter.</p>



<p>It’s difficult to map dark matter around such distant galaxies, says cosmologist Hironao Miyatake of Nagoya University in Japan. That’s because scientists need a source of light that is farther away than the galaxy acting as the lens. Typically, scientists use even more distant galaxies as the source of that light. But when peering this deep into space, those galaxies are difficult to come by.</p>



<p>So instead, Miyatake and colleagues turned to the cosmic microwave background, the oldest light in the universe. The team used measurements of lensing of the cosmic microwave background from the <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/planck-satellite-picture-infant-universe-gets-final-tweaks">Planck satellite</a>, combined with a multitude of distant galaxies observed by the Subaru Telescope in Hawaii (<em>SN: 7/24/18</em>). “The gravitational lensing effect is very small, so we need a lot of lens galaxies,” Miyatake says. The distribution of dark matter around the galaxies matched expectations, the researchers report.</p>



<p>The researchers also estimated a quantity called sigma-8, a measure of how “clumpy” matter is in the cosmos. For years, scientists have found hints that different <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/clumpy-universe-disagreement-physics-cosmology">measurements of sigma-8</a> disagree with one another (<em>SN: 8/10/20</em>). That could be a hint that something is wrong with scientists’ theories of the universe. But the evidence isn’t conclusive.</p>



<p>“One of the most interesting things in cosmology right now is whether that tension is real or not,” says cosmologist Risa Wechsler of Stanford University, who was not involved with the study. “This is a really nice example of one of the techniques that will help shed light on that.”</p>



<p>Measuring sigma-8 using early, distant galaxies could help reveal what’s going on. “You want to measure this quantity, this sigma-8, from as many perspectives as possible,” says cosmologist Hendrik Hildebrandt of Ruhr University Bochum in Germany, who was not involved with the study.</p>



<p>If estimates from different eras of the universe disagree with one another, that might help physicists craft a new theory that could better explain the cosmos. While the new measurement of sigma-8 isn’t precise enough to settle the debate, future projects, such as the <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/new-observatory-named-after-dark-matter-pioneer-vera-rubin">Rubin Observatory</a> in Chile, could improve the estimate (<em>SN: 1/10/20</em>).</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/exoplanets-mini-neptune-super-earth-atmosphere-space">Mini-Neptunes may become super-Earths as the exoplanets lose their atmospheres</a></h4>

              
                <p>Mini-Neptunes and super-Earths may have a lot more in common than just being superlatives.</p>



<p>Four gaseous exoplanets, each a bit smaller than Neptune, seem to be evolving into super-Earths, rocky worlds up to 1.5 times the width of our home planet. That’s because the intense radiation of their stars appears <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.13099">to be pushing away the planets’ thick atmospheres</a>, researchers report in a paper submitted July 26 at arXiv.org. If the current rate of atmospheric loss keeps up, the team predicts, those puffy atmospheres will eventually vanish, leaving behind smaller planets of bare rock.</p>





<p>Studying how these worlds evolve and lose their atmospheres can help scientists understand how other exoplanets lose their atmospheres. And that, says astronomer Heather Knutson of Caltech, can provide intel on what types of planets might have habitable environments. “Because if you can’t keep an atmosphere,” she says, “you can’t be habitable.”</p>



<p>Knutson and her colleagues’ new study bolsters a previous suspicion. Earlier this year, the same researchers reported that <a href="https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-3881/ac3fa7">helium seemed to be escaping</a> the atmosphere of one these mini-Neptunes. But the team wasn’t sure if their discovery was a one-off. “Maybe we just got very lucky for this one planet, but every other planet is different,” says exoplanet researcher Michael Zhang, also of Caltech.</p>



<p>So the team looked at three more mini-Neptunes orbiting other stars and compared those worlds to the first planet they had observed. Each of these planets occasionally <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/space-exoplanet-century-astronomy-earth-universe">blocks some of the light from its star</a> (<em>SN: 7/21/21</em>).&nbsp; Zhang, Knutson and colleagues tracked how long each planet blocked its stars’ light and how much of that starlight was absorbed by helium enveloping the planets. Together, these observations let the team measure the sizes and shapes of the planets’ atmospheres.</p>



<p>“When a planet is losing its atmosphere, you get this big, sort of cometlike tail of gas coming out from the planet,” Knutson says. If the gas instead is still bound to the planet — as is the case for Neptune in our solar system — the astronomers would have seen a circle. “We don’t fully understand all the shapes that we see in the outflows,” she says, “but we see they’re not spherical.”</p>



<p>In other words, each planet is steadily losing its helium. “I never would have guessed that every single planet we looked at, that we would see such a clear detection,” Knutson says.</p>



<p>The astronomers also calculated how much mass <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/kepler-exoplanets-habitable-earth-neptune">those exoplanets</a> were losing (<em>SN: 6/19/17</em>). “This mass loss rate is high enough to strip the atmospheres of at least most of these planets, so that some of them, at least, will become super-Earths,” Zhang says.</p>



<p>These rates, though, are just snapshots in time, says Ian Crossfield, an exoplanet researcher at the University of Kansas in Lawrence who was not involved with this work. For each planet, “you don’t know exactly how it’s been losing atmosphere throughout its entire history and into the future,” he says. “All we know is what we see today.” Even with such open questions, he adds, the idea that mini-Neptunes turn into super-Earths “seems plausible.”</p>



<p>Theories and computer simulations of how planets form and lose their atmospheres can help fill in some of the blanks on individual planets, Crossfield says.</p>



<p>Measurements of more mini-Neptunes will also help. Zhang plans to observe another handful. In addition, “we’ve already looked at one more target, and that target also has a pretty strong escaping helium [signal],” he says. “Now we have five for five.”</p>

<h4>Navigating neutrinos</h4>



<p><em>Tidal disruption events, in which supermassive black holes rip apart stars, could supercharge ghostly subatomic particles called neutrinos, <strong>Emily Conover</strong> reported in “<a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/high-energy-neutrinos-black-holes-stars-tidal-disruption-event">Zippy neutrino linked to a source</a>” (</em>SN: 6/18/22, p. 8<em>).</em></p>



<p><strong>Conover</strong> reported that scientists tracked a high-energy neutrino to an area of the sky where a bright flare, thought to be a tidal disruption event, had been discovered roughly a year before. Reader<strong> Doug McElroy</strong> wanted to know if the delay in the observation of the neutrino reveals the distance of the tidal disruption event from Earth.</p>





<p>It doesn’t, <strong>Conover</strong> says. “High-energy neutrinos and light travel at nearly the same speed (neutrinos are just slightly slower due to their mass), so that difference in travel time shouldn’t make a big difference in when we see the particles,” she says.</p>



<p>Instead, the timing suggests that the process of a black hole tearing apart a star, creating an environment that accelerates particles, can last for a while, <strong>Conover</strong> says. In this case, at least a year. Scientists think this particular neutrino would have been emitted about a year after the flare from the tidal disruption event.</p>



<h4>Dust it off</h4>



<p><em>Biological soil crusts</em> — <em>thin layers of soil glued together by dirt-dwelling organisms</em> — <em>reduce global dust emissions by roughly 60 percent, <strong>Nikk Ogasa</strong> reported in “<a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/soil-biocrusts-reduce-global-dust-emissions-earth">Biocrusts keep the dust settled</a>” (</em>SN: 6/18/22, p. 12<em>).</em></p>



<p>Extra dust could impact river flows, <strong>Ogasa</strong> wrote. For instance, fallen dust in the Upper Colorado River Basin reduced flows of meltwater into the Colorado River by an average of about 5 percent every year. Reader <strong>Greg Skala</strong> asked how dust can have such an effect on runoff.</p>



<p>Dust that fell on the basin’s snowy surfaces decreased the amount of sunlight they reflected, causing the snow to melt several weeks earlier in the year than anticipated, <strong>Ogasa</strong> says. That left the vegetation and soils that were buried underneath exposed for a longer period, increasing the amount of water lost to the air through a process called evapotranspiration. As more water was lost to the air, less eventually made its way to the river.</p>

Twitter user <strong>@CelStPierre</strong> quipped: “This ‘food for thought’ is certainly worth researching.”</p>

<h4>Rogue one</h4>



<p><em>Scientists observed two black holes merge into one. Then, gravitational waves kicked the newly formed black hole away from its home, <strong>Emily Conover </strong>reported in “<a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/black-hole-gravitational-waves-kick-ligo-merger-spacetime">Space ripples gave black hole the boot</a>” (</em>SN: 6/18/22, p. 8<em>).</em></p>



<p>Reader <strong>Bradley Ruben</strong> wondered if the discovery implies that there are lone, rogue black holes zipping through space, potentially destroying solar systems or other celestial objects in the way.</p>



<p>Isolated black holes that travel through space do exist, <strong>Conover</strong> says. In fact, scientists may have spotted one<a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/black-hole-rogue-wandering-mass-sun-gravity-neutron-star"> a few thousand light-years from Earth</a> (<em>SN: 7/16/22 &amp; 7/30/22, p. 11</em>). But the implications are not quite as dramatic as one might imagine.</p>



<p>Space is really big, and the number of solo black holes is relatively small, making any direct hits by a black hole very rare, <strong>Conover</strong> says.</p>



<p>“And contrary to popular belief, black holes don’t ‘suck in’ everything around them,” she says. If the black hole doesn’t get too close and simply passes by, it would just exert a gravitational pull on the planetary system it encounters. In that way, it would act similar to any other massive object traveling through space, such as a star, she says.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/our-enduring-fascination-with-outer-space">Our enduring fascination with outer space</a></h4>

              
                <p>The glowing dots in the night sky have enthralled for as long as people could look skyward. Our desire to figure out what makes the stars blaze and why some of the celestial bodies move in strange ways has sparked centuries of conjecture, observation and exploration, from the simple telescope Galileo used to observe Mars in the early 1600s to the new James Webb Space Telescope, a 14,300-pound behemoth with a mirror so big it had to be folded up to fit into the launch vehicle.</p>



<p>Count us here at <em>Science News</em> among those fascinated by space. We’ve covered it from the 1920s, when astronomer Edwin Hubble started making his big discoveries, through the launch of the first satellite, Sputnik, in 1957, and the “space race” that put people on the moon in 1969. Now, increasingly sophisticated robots are independently exploring other planets and even the sun, and reporting back to us here on Earth.</p>





<p>This issue’s cover story celebrates the 25th anniversary of rovers on the surface of Mars, starting with the arrival of tiny Sojourner on July 4, 1997. Three rovers are currently hard at work <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/mars-rover-robot-red-planet-history-nasa-china">probing the Red Planet’s surface and atmosphere</a>. Those machines, NASA’s Curiosity and Perseverance — the SUVs of Mars vehicles — and China’s smaller Zhurong, are greatly expanding Mars exploration, contributor Alexandra Witze writes. Perseverance is collecting rock samples that future missions can return to Earth. It even serves as home base for the tiny helicopter dubbed Ingenuity that has buzzed around dozens of times, outliving its anticipated life span and delighting its creators and the public alike.</p>



<p>That’s not the only space news worth noting. In July, NASA revealed the first images delivered by the James Webb Space Telescope, and they are mind-blowing. They look back in time more than 13 billion years to reveal swarms of <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/james-webb-space-telescope-first-image-nasa">never-before-seen galaxies</a>. The idea of building a giant telescope and shooting it into space was audacious when it was dreamed up in the 1980s. And the project was plagued by years of delays and massive cost overruns. Even after its successful launch in December, scientists and engineers held their breaths, fearing that the craft would fail to complete the complicated task of unfolding its mirror and five-layered sunshield. After all that, seeing these radiant images and knowing there will be many more (and more new discoveries) on the way, it seems worth the wait.</p>



<p>And why stop there? This issue also covers how <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/space-bone-loss-density-astronaut-recovery-gravity">months in space affect astronauts’ bone health</a>, which is bad news for those of us who would like to travel to Mars and also stand upright afterward. We report the results of the latest<a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/dark-matter-lz-experiment-physics"> efforts to find elusive dark matter</a>. And we also relay how <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/alien-quantum-communication-extraterrestrial-communication-signal">quantum messaging might help aliens communicate with us</a> on Earth. Here’s hoping that they’ll be more like E.T. than like the creature in the <em>Alien</em> movies.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/mars-rover-robot-red-planet-history-nasa-china">How Mars rovers have evolved in 25 years of exploring the Red Planet</a></h4>

              
                <p class="has-drop-cap" style="font-size:20px">Few things are harder than hurling a robot into space — and sticking the landing. On the morning of July 4, 1997, mission controllers at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, Calif., were hoping to beat the odds and land a spacecraft successfully on the Red Planet.</p>



<p>Twenty-five years ago that little robot, a six-wheeled rover named Sojourner, made it — becoming the first in a string of rovers built and operated by NASA to explore Mars. Four more NASA rovers, each more capable and complex than the last, have surveyed the Red Planet. The one named Curiosity marked its 10th year of cruising around on August 5. Another, named Perseverance, is busy collecting rocks that future robots are supposed to retrieve and bring back to Earth. China recently got into the Mars exploring game, landing its own rover, Zhurong, last year.</p>





<p>Other Mars spacecraft have done amazing science from a standstill, such as the twin Viking landers in the 1970s that were the first to photograph the Martian surface up close and the <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/what-nasa-insight-lander-learned-about-mars-magnetism-quakes">InSight probe that has been listening for Marsquakes shaking the planet’s innards</a> (<em>SN Online: 2/24/20</em>). But the ability to rove turns a robot into an interplanetary field geologist, able to explore the landscape and piece together clues to its history. Mobility, says Kirsten Siebach, a planetary scientist at Rice University in Houston, “makes it a journey of discovery.”</p>



<div class="wp-block-sciencenews-content-sidebar">
<h4>Red planet ramblings</h4>



<p>Five U.S. rovers and one Chinese rover have reached Mars, all visiting different locations on the planet. Many focused on areas that may have once been wet and favorable for potential life.</p>

<p>Each of the Mars rovers has gone to a different place on the planet, enabling scientists to build a broad understanding of how Mars evolved over time. The rovers revealed that Mars contained water, and other life-friendly conditions, for much of its history. That work set the stage for Perseverance’s ongoing hunt for signs of ancient life on Mars.</p>



<div class="wp-block-sciencenews-content-sidebar">
<h4>Off-road trips</h4>



<p>The ruggedness of the rovers is a big factor in how far they travel and how long they operate. Three of the machines are still exploring.</p>

<p>Each rover is also a reflection of the humans who designed and built and drove it. Perseverance carries on one of its wheels a symbol of Mars rover tracks twisted into the double helix shape of DNA. That’s “to remind us, whatever this rover is, it’s of human origin,” says Jennifer Trosper, an engineer at the Jet Propulsion Lab, or JPL, who has worked on all five NASA rovers. “It is us on Mars, and kind of our creation.”</p>

<p>Sojourner, that first rover, was born in an era when engineers weren’t sure if they even could get a robot to work on Mars. In the early 1990s, then-NASA Administrator Daniel Goldin was pushing the agency to do things “faster, better and cheaper” — a catchphrase that engineers would mock by saying only two of those three things were possible at the same time. NASA had no experience with inter­planetary rovers. Only the Soviet Union had operated rovers — on the moon in 1970 and 1973.</p>



<p>JPL began developing a Mars rover anyway. Named after the abolitionist Sojourner Truth, the basic machine was the size of a microwave oven. Engineers were limited in where they could send it; they needed a large flat region on Mars because handling a precision landing near mountains or canyons was beyond their abilities. NASA chose Ares Vallis, a broad outflow channel from an ancient flood, and the mission landed there successfully.</p>



<p>Sojourner spent nearly three months poking around the landscape. It was slow going. Mission controllers had to communicate with Sojourner constantly, telling it where to roll and then assessing whether it had gotten there safely. They made mistakes: One time they uploaded a sequence of computer commands that mistakenly told the rover to shut itself down. They recovered from that stumble and many others, learning to quickly fix problems and move forward.</p>

<p>Although Sojourner was a test mission to show that a rover could work, it managed to do some science with its one X-ray spectrometer. The little machine analyzed the chemical makeup of 15 Martian rocks and tested the friction of the Martian soil.</p>



<p>After surviving 11 weeks beyond its planned one-week lifetime, Sojourner ultimately grew too cold to operate. Trosper was in mission control when the rover died on September 27, 1997. “You build these things, and even if they’re well beyond their lifetime, you just can’t let go very easily, because they’re part of you,” she says.</p>

<h4>Twin explorers</h4>



<p>In 1998 and 1999, NASA hurled a pair of spacecraft at Mars; one was supposed to orbit the planet and another was supposed to land near one of the poles. Both failed. Stung from the disappointment, NASA decided to build a rover plus a backup for its next attempt.</p>



<p>Thus were born the twins Spirit and Opportunity. Each the size of a golf cart, they were a major step up from Sojourner. Each had a robotic arm, a crucial development in rover evolution that enabled the machines to do increasingly sophisticated science. The two had beefed-up cameras, three spectrometers and a tool that could grind into rocks to reveal the texture beneath the surface.</p>



<p>But there were a lot of bugs to work out. Spirit and Opportunity launched several weeks apart in 2003. Spirit got to Mars first, and on its 18th Martian day on the surface it froze up and started sending error messages. It took mission controllers days to sort out the problem — an overloaded flash-memory system — all while Opportunity was barreling toward Mars. Ultimately, engineers fixed the problem, and Opportunity landed safely on the opposite side of the planet from Spirit.</p>



<p>Both rovers lasted years beyond their expected three-month lifetimes. And both did far more Martian science than anticipated.</p>



<p>Spirit broke one of its wheels early on and had to drive backward, dragging the broken wheel behind it. But the rover found plenty to do near its landing site of Gusev crater, home to a classic Mars landscape of dust, rock and hills. Spirit found rocks that appeared to have been altered by water long ago and later spotted a pair of iron-rich meteorites. The rover ultimately perished in 2010, stuck in a sand-filled pit. Mission controllers tried to extract it in an effort dubbed “Free Spirit,” but salts had precipitated around the sand grains, making them particularly slippery.</p>



<p>Opportunity, in contrast, became the Energizer Bunny of rovers, exploring constantly and refusing to die. Immediately after landing in Meridiani Planum, Opportunity had scientists abuzz.</p>

<p>“The images that the rover first sent back were just so different from any other images we’d seen of the Martian surface,” says Abigail Fraeman, a planetary scientist at JPL. “Instead of these really dusty volcanic plains, there was just this dark sand and this really bright bedrock. And that was just so captivating and inspiring.”</p>



<p>Right at its landing site, Opportunity <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/signs-water-flow-oceans-data-point-ancient-martian-sea">spotted the first definitive evidence of past liquid water on Mars</a>, a much-anticipated and huge discovery (<em>SN: 3/27/04, p. 195</em>). The rover went on to find evidence of liquid water at different times in the Martian past. After years of driving, the rover reached a crater called Endeavour and “stepped into a totally new world,” Fraeman says. The rocks at Endeavour were hundreds of millions of years older than others studied on Mars. They contained evidence of different types of ancient water chemistry.</p>



<p>Opportunity ultimately drove farther than any rover on any extraterrestrial world, breaking a Soviet rover’s lunar record. In 2015, Opportunity passed 26.2 miles (42.2 km) on its odometer; mission controllers celebrated by putting a marathon medal onto a mock-up of the rover and driving it through a finish line ribbon at JPL. Opportunity <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/nasa-mars-opportunity-rover-dead">finally died in 2019</a> after an intense dust storm obscured the sun, cutting off solar power, a must-have for the rover to recharge its batteries (<em>SN: 3/16/19, p. 7</em>).</p>



<p>The twin rovers were a huge advance over Sojourner. But the next rover was an entirely different beast.</p>

<p><strong>SIZE: </strong>SUV</p>



<p><strong>FUN FACTS: </strong></p>



<ul><li>Needed a sky crane with rockets to hover above ground and slowly lower the behemoth to the surface</li><li>Found evidence of an ancient lake, sniffed methane gas, measured radiation levels</li></ul>
</div>



<h4>The SUV of rovers</h4>



<p>By the mid-2000s, NASA had decided it needed to go big on Mars, with a megarover the size of a sports utility vehicle. The one-ton Curiosity was so heavy that its engineers had to come up with an entirely new way to land on Mars. The “sky crane” system used retro-rockets to hover above the Martian surface and slowly lower the rover to the ground.</p>



<p>Against all odds, in August 2012, Curiosity <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/wheels-down-mars-rover-takes-view">landed safely near Mount Sharp</a>, a 5-kilometer-high pile of sediment within the 154-kilometer-wide Gale crater (<em>SN: 8/25/12, p. 5</em>). Unlike the first three Mars rovers, which were solar-powered, Curiosity runs on energy produced by the radioactive decay of plutonium. That allows the rover to travel farther and faster, and to power a suite of sophisticated science instruments, including two chemical laboratories.</p>



<p>Curiosity introduced a new way of exploring Mars. When the rover arrives in a new area, it looks around with its cameras, then zaps interesting rocks with its laser to identify which ones are worth a closer look. Once up close, the rover stretches out its robotic arm and does science, including drilling into rocks to see what they are made of.</p>



<p>When Curiosity arrived near the base of Mount Sharp, it immediately spotted rounded pebbles shaped by a once-flowing river, the first close­up look at an ancient river on Mars. Then mission controllers sent the rover rolling away from the mountain, toward an area in the crater known as Yellowknife Bay. There Curiosity discovered evidence of an ancient lake that created life-friendly conditions for potentially many thousands of years.</p>



<p>Curiosity then headed back toward the foothills of Mount Sharp. Along the way, the rover discovered a range of organic molecules in many different rocks, hinting at environments that had been habitable for millions to tens of millions of years. It sniffed <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/curiosity-finds-mars-methane-changes-seasons">methane gas sporadically wafting within Gale crater</a>, a still-unexplained mystery that could result from geologic reactions, though methane on Earth can be formed by living organisms (<em>SN: 7/7/18, p. 8</em>). The rover measured radiation levels across the surface — helpful for future astronauts who’ll need to gauge their exposure — and observed dust devils, clouds and eclipses in the Martian atmosphere and night sky.</p>

<p>“We’ve encountered so many unexpectedly rich things,” says Ashwin Vasavada of JPL, the mission’s project scientist. “I’m just glad a place like this existed.”</p>



<p>Ten years into its mission, Curiosity still trundles on, making new discoveries as it climbs the foothills of Mount Sharp. It recently departed a clay-rich environment and is now entering one that is heavier in sulfates, a transition that may reflect a major shift in the Martian climate billions of years ago.</p>



<p>In the course of driving more than 28 kilometers, Curiosity has weathered major glitches, including one that shuttered its drilling system for over a year. And its wheels have been banged up more than earthbound tests had predicted. The rover will continue to roll until some unknown failure kills it or its plutonium power wanes, perhaps five years from now.</p>

<h4>A rover and its sidekick</h4>



<p>NASA’s first four rovers set the stage for the most capable and agile rover ever to visit Mars: Perseverance. Trosper likens the evolution of the machines to the growth of children. “We have a preschooler in Sojourner, and then &#8230; your happy-go-lucky teenagers in Spirit and Opportunity,” she says. “Curiosity is certainly a young adult that’s able to do a lot of things on her own, and Perseverance is kind of that high-powered mid­career [person] able to do pretty much anything you ask with really no questions.”</p>



<p>Perseverance is basically a copy of Curiosity built from its spare parts, but with one major modification: a system for drilling, collecting and storing slender cores of rock. Perseverance’s job is to collect samples of Martian rock for future missions to bring to Earth, in what would be the first robotic sample return from Mars. That would allow scientists to do sophisticated analyses of Martian rocks in their earthbound labs. “It feels, even more than previous missions, that we are doing this for the next generation,” Siebach says.</p>



<p>The rover is working fast. Compared with Curiosity’s leisurely exploration of Gale crater, Perseverance has been zooming around its landing site, the 45-kilometer-wide Jezero crater, since its February 2021 arrival. It has collected 10 rock cores and is already eyeing where to put them down on the surface for future missions to pick up. “We’re going to bring samples back from a diversity of locations,” says mission project scientist Kenneth Farley of Caltech. “And so we keep to a schedule.”</p>



<p>Perseverance went to Jezero to study an ancient river delta, which contains layers of sediment that may harbor evidence of ancient Martian life. But the rover slightly missed its target, landing on the other side of a set of impassable sand dunes. So it <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/perseverance-rover-mars-photos-nasa">spent most of its first year exploring the crater floor</a>, which turned out to be made of igneous rocks (<em>SN: 9/11/21, p. 32</em>). The rocks had cooled from molten magma and were not the sedimentary rocks that many had expected.</p>



<p>Scientists back on Earth will be able to precisely date the age of the igneous rocks, based on the radioactive decay of chemical elements within them, providing the first direct evidence for the age of rocks from a particular place on Mars.</p>

<p>Once it finished exploring the crater floor in March, the rover drove quickly toward the delta. Each successive NASA rover has had greater skills in autonomous driving, able to identify hazards, steer around them and keep going without needing constant instructions from mission control.</p>



<p>Perseverance has a separate computer processor to run calculations for autonomous navigation, allowing it to move faster than Curiosity. (It took Curiosity two and a half years to travel 10 kilometers; Perseverance traveled that far in a little over a year.) “The rover drives pretty much every minute that we can give it,” Farley says.</p>



<p>In April, Perseverance set a Martian driving record, traveling nearly five kilometers in just 30 Martian days. If all goes well, it will make some trips up and down the delta, then travel to Jezero crater’s rim and out onto the ancient plains beyond.</p>



<p>Perseverance has a sidekick, Ingenuity, the first helicopter to visit another world. The nimble flier, only half a meter tall, succeeded beyond its designers’ wildest dreams. The <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/ingenuity-helicopter-mars-nasa-flight-1-year-anniversary">helicopter made 29 flights in its first 16 months</a> when it was only supposed to make five in one month. It has scouted paths ahead and scientific targets for the rover (<em>SN Online: 4/19/22</em>). Future rovers are almost certain to carry a little buddy like this.</p>

<p><strong>FUN FACTS</strong>:</p>



<ul><li>Dormant now during Martian winter, but is set to reawaken in December</li><li>Found signs of recent water activity in a&nbsp; geologically young setting</li><li>Found Martian soil similar to some of Earth’s desert sands</li></ul>
</div>



<h4>China’s debut</h4>



<p>While the United States has led in Mars rover exploration, it is not the only player on the scene. In May 2021, China became the second nation to successfully place a rover on Mars. Its Zhurong rover, named after a mythological fire god, has been exploring part of a large basin in the planet’s northern hemisphere known as Utopia Planitia.</p>



<p>The landing site lies near a geologic boundary that may be an ancient Martian shoreline. Compared with the other Mars rover locations, Zhurong’s landing site is billions of years younger, “so we are investigating a different world on Mars,” says Lu Pan, a planetary scientist at the University of Copenhagen who has collaborated with Zhurong scientists.</p>



<p>In many ways, Zhurong resembles Spirit and Opportunity, in size as well as mobility. It carries cameras, a laser spectrometer for studying rocks and ground-penetrating radar to <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/china-first-mars-rover-landed-sending-photos">probe underground soil structures</a> (<em>SN Online: 5/19/21</em>).</p>



<p>After landing, Zhurong snapped pictures of its rock-strewn surroundings and headed south to explore a variety of geologic terrains, including mysterious cones that could be mud volcanoes and ridges that look like windblown dunes. The rover’s initial findings include that the Martian soil at Utopia Planitia is similar to some desert sands on Earth and that water had been present there perhaps as recently as 700 million years ago.</p>



<p>In May, mission controllers switched Zhurong into dormant mode for the Martian winter and hope it wakes up at the end of the season, in December. It has already traveled nearly two kilometers across the surface, farther than the meager 100 meters that Sojourner managed. (To be fair, Sojourner had to keep circling its lander because it relied on that lander to communicate with Earth.)</p>

<p>From Sojourner to Zhurong, the Mars rovers show what humankind can accomplish on another planet. Future rovers might include the European Space Agency’s ExoMars, although its 2022 launch <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/russia-ukraine-war-space-science-nasa">was postponed after Russia attacked Ukraine</a> (<em>SN: 3/26/22, p. 6</em>). Europe terminated all research collaborations with Russia after the invasion, including launching ExoMars on a Russian rocket.</p>



<p>Vasavada remembers his sense of awe at the Curiosity launch in 2011: “Standing there in Florida, watching this rocket blasting off and feeling it in your chest and knowing that there’s this incredibly fragile complex machine hurtling on the end of this rocket.… It just gave me this full impression that here we are, humans, blasting these things off into space,” he says. “We’re little tiny human beings sending these things to another planet.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/windchime-experiment-dark-matter-wind-gravity-physics">The Windchime experiment could use gravity to hunt for dark matter ‘wind’</a></h4>

              
                <p>The secret to directly detecting dark matter might be blowin’ in the wind.</p>



<p>The mysterious substance continues to elude scientists even though it outweighs visible matter in the universe by about 8 to 1. All laboratory attempts to directly detect dark matter — seen only indirectly by the effect its gravity has on the motions of stars and galaxies — have gone unfulfilled.</p>



<p>Those attempts have relied on the hope that dark matter has at least <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/latest-dark-matter-searches-leave-scientists-empty-handed">some other interaction</a> with ordinary matter in addition to gravity (<em>SN: 10/25/16</em>). But a proposed experiment called Windchime, though decades from being realized, will try something new: It will search for dark matter using the only force it is guaranteed to feel — gravity.</p>





<p>“The core idea is extremely simple,” says theoretical physicist Daniel Carney, who described the scheme in May at a meeting of the American Physical Society’s Division of Atomic Molecular and Optical Physics in Orlando, Fla. Like a wind chime on a porch rattling in a breeze, the Windchime detector would <a href="https://meetings.aps.org/Meeting/DAMOP22/Session/2A.8">try to sense a dark matter “wind</a>” blowing past Earth as the solar system whips around the galaxy. &nbsp;</p>



<p>If the Milky Way is mostly a cloud of dark matter, as astronomical measurements suggest, then we should be sailing through it at about 200 kilometers per second. This creates a dark matter wind, for the same reason you feel a wind when you stick your hand out the window of a moving car.</p>



<p>The Windchime detector is based on the notion that a collection of pendulums will swing in a breeze. In the case of backyard wind chimes, it might be metal rods or dangling bells that jingle in moving air. For the dark matter detector, the pendulums are arrays of minute, ultrasensitive detectors that will be jostled by the gravitational forces they feel from passing bits of dark matter. Instead of air molecules bouncing off metal chimes, the gravitational attraction of the particles that make up the dark matter wind would cause distinctive ripples as it blows through a billion or so sensors in a box measuring about a meter per side.</p>

<p>While it may seem logical to search for dark matter using gravity, no one has tried it in the nearly 40 years that scientists have been pursuing dark matter in the lab. That’s because gravity is, comparatively, a very weak force and difficult to isolate in experiments.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“You’re looking for dark matter to [cause] a gravitational signal in the sensor,” says Carney, of Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory in California. “And you just ask . . . could I possibly see this gravitational signal? When you first make the estimate, the answer is no. It’s actually going to be infeasibly difficult.”</p>



<p>That didn&#8217;t stop Carney and a small group of colleagues from <a href="https://journals.aps.org/prd/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevD.102.072003">exploring the idea anyway in 2020</a>. “Thirty years ago, this would have been totally nuts to propose,” he says. “It’s still kind of nuts, but it&#8217;s like borderline insanity.”</p>



<p>The Windchime Project collaboration has since grown to include 20 physicists. They have a prototype Windchime built of commercial accelerometers and are using it to develop the software and analysis that will lead to the final version of the detector, but it’s a far cry from the ultimate design. Carney estimates that it could take another few decades to develop sensors good enough to measure gravity even from heavy dark matter.</p>



<p>Carney bases the timeline on the development of the <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/gravity-waves-black-holes-verify-einsteins-prediction">Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Interferometer</a>, or LIGO, which was designed to look for gravitational ripples coming from black holes colliding (<em>SN: 2/11/16</em>). When LIGO was first conceived, he says, it was clear that the technology would need to be improved by a hundred million times. Decades of development resulted in an observatory that views the sky in gravitational waves. With Windchime, “we’re in the exact same boat,” he says.</p>



<p>Even in its final form, Windchime will be sensitive only to dark matter bits that are roughly the mass of a fine speck of dust. That’s enormous on the spectrum of known particles — more than a million trillion times the mass of a proton.</p>



<p>“There is a variety of very interesting dark matter candidates at [that scale] that are definitely worth looking for … including primordial black holes from the early universe,” says Katherine Freese, a physicist at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor who is not part of the Windchime collaboration. Black holes slowly evaporate, leaking mass back into space, she notes, which could leave many relics formed shortly after the Big Bang at the mass Windchime could detect.</p>



<p>But if it never detects anything at all, the experiment still stands out from other dark matter detection schemes, says Dan Hooper, a physicist at Fermilab in Batavia, Ill., also not affiliated with the project. That’s because it would be the first experiment that could entirely rule out some types of dark matter.</p>



<p>Even if the experiment turns up nothing, Hooper says, “the amazing thing about [Windchime] … is that, independent of anything else you know about dark matter particles, they aren’t in this mass range.” With <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/dark-matter-lz-experiment-physics">existing experiments</a>, a failure to detect anything could instead be due to flawed guesses about the forces that affect dark matter (<em>SN: 7/7/22</em>). &nbsp;</p>



<p>Windchime will be the only experiment yet imagined where seeing nothing would definitively tell researchers what dark matter isn’t. With a little luck, though, it could uncover a wind of tiny black holes, or even more exotic dark matter bits, blowing past as we careen around the Milky Way.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/dead-wolf-spiders-robots-necrobots">Scientists turned dead spiders into robots</a></h4>

              
                <p>Scientists have literally reanimated dead spiders to do their bidding.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In a new field dubbed “necrobotics,” researchers <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/advs.202201174">converted the corpses</a> of wolf spiders into grippers that can manipulate objects. All the team had to do was stab a syringe into a dead spider’s back and superglue it in place. Pushing fluid in and out of the cadaver made its legs clench open and shut, the researchers report July 25 in <em>Advanced Science</em>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The idea was born from a simple question, explains Faye Yap, a mechanical engineer at Rice University in Houston. Why do spiders curl up when they die?</p>





<p>The answer: Spiders are <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/orb-spiders-mating-male-catapult-female-sex-cannibalism">hydraulic machines</a> (<em>SN: 4/25/22</em>). They control how much their legs extend by forcing blood into them. A dead spider no longer has that blood pressure, so its legs curl up.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“We were just thinking that was so cool,” Yap says. “We wanted to leverage it.”</p>



<p>Her team first tried putting dead wolf spiders in a double boiler, hoping that the wet heat would make the spiders expand and push their legs outward. That didn’t work. But when the researchers injected fluid straight into a spider corpse, they found that they could control its grip well enough to pull wires from a circuit board and pick up other dead spiders. Only after hundreds of uses did the necrobots start to become dehydrated and show signs of wear.</p>

Yap and coauthors</span></figcaption></figure></div>


<p>In the future, the researchers will coat spiders with a sealant to hold off that decline. But the next big step is to control the spiders’ legs individually, Yap says, and in the process, figure out more about how spiders work. Then her team could translate their understanding into better designs for other robots.</p>



<p>“That would be very, very interesting,” says Rashid Bashir, a bioengineer at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign who wasn’t involved in the new study. A spider corpse itself would probably have problems as a robot, he says, because it won’t perform consistently like “hard robots” and its body will break down over time. But spiders can definitely <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/bacteria-can-be-coaxed-making-toughest-kind-spider-silk">offer lessons</a> to engineers (<em>SN: 4/2/19</em>). “There’s a lot to be learned from biology and nature,” Bashir says.</p>



<p>Despite the whole reanimating dead spiders thing, Yap is no mad scientist. She wonders whether it’s okay to play Frankenstein, even with spiders. “No one really talks about the ethics” when it comes to this sort of research, she says.</p>



<p>Scientists need to figure out the morality of this sort of bioengineering before they get too good at it, Bashir agrees. The question is, he says, “how far do you go?” </p>

                The zoonotic disease is now spreading from person to person. But if it finds a home in new wildlife species, it could settle in to become a permanent risk.
