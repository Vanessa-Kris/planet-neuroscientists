              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/climate-change-ipcc-un-report-action-solutions">A UN report says stopping climate change is possible but action is needed now</a></h4>

              
                <p>It doesn’t have to be this way.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The world already has the know-how and tools to dramatically reduce emissions from fossil fuels — but <a href="https://www.ipcc.ch/report/ar6/wg3/">we need to use those tools immediately</a> if we hope to forestall the worst impacts of climate change. That’s the message of the third and final installment of the massive sixth assessment of climate science by the United Nations’ Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, which was released April 4.</p>



<p>“We know what to do, we know how to do it, and now it’s up to us to take action,” said sustainable energy researcher Jim Skea of Imperial College London, who cochaired the report, at a news event announcing its release.&nbsp;</p>





<p>Earth is on track to warm <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/united-nations-climate-report-finds-countries-urgently-need-reduce-emissions">by an average of about 3.2 degrees</a> Celsius above preindustrial levels by the end of the century (<em>SN: 11/26/19</em>). Altering that course and limiting warming to 1.5 degrees or even 2 degrees means that global fossil fuel emissions will need to peak no later than the year 2025, the new report states.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Right now, meeting that goal looks extremely unlikely. National pledges to reduce fossil fuel emissions to date amount to “a litany of broken climate promises,” said United Nations Secretary-General António Guterres at the event.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The previous two installments of the IPCC’s sixth assessment described how <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/climate-change-un-ipcc-report-humans">climate change is already fueling extreme weather events</a> around the globe — and noted that <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/climate-united-nations-ipcc-report-people-nature">adaptation alone will not be enough</a> to shield people from those hazards (<em>SN: 8/9/21</em>; <em>SN: 2/28/22</em>).</p>



<p>The looming climate crisis “is horrifying, and I don’t want to sugarcoat that,” says Bronson Griscom, a forest ecologist and the director of Natural Climate Solutions at the environmental organization Conservation International, based in Arlington, Va.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But Griscom, who was not an author on the new IPCC report, says its findings also give him hope. It’s “what I would call a double-or-nothing bet that we’re confronted with right now,” he says. “There [are] multiple ways that this report is basically saying, ‘Look, if we don’t do anything, it’s increasingly grim.’ But the reasons to do something are incredibly powerful and the tools in the toolbox are very powerful.”</p>



<h4>Tools in the toolbox</h4>



<p>Those tools are strategies that governments, industries and individuals can use to cut emissions immediately in multiple sectors of the global economy, including transportation, energy, building, agriculture and forestry, and urban development. Taking immediate advantage of opportunities to reduce emissions in each of those sectors would halve global emissions by 2030, the report states.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Consider the transportation sector, which contributed 15 percent of human-related greenhouse gas emissions in 2019. Globally, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/electric-vehicles-cars-climate-change-challenges-2021">electric vehicle sales have surged</a> in the last few years, driven largely by government policies and tougher emissions laws for the auto industry (<em>SN: 12/22/21</em>).&nbsp;</p>



<p>If that surge continues, “electric vehicles offer us the greatest potential [to reduce transportation emissions on land], as long as they&#8217;re combined with low or zero carbon electricity sources,” Inger Andersen, the executive director of the United Nations Environment Programme, said at the news event. But for aviation and long-haul shipping, which are more difficult to electrify, reduced carbon emissions could be achieved with low-carbon hydrogen fuels or biofuels, though these alternatives require further research and development.</p>



<p>Then there are urban areas, which are contributing a growing proportion of global greenhouse gas emissions, from 62 percent in 2015 to between 67 and 72 percent in 2020, the report notes. In established cities, buildings can be retrofitted, renovated or repurposed to make city layouts more walkable and provide more accessible public transportation options.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And growing cities can incorporate energy-efficient infrastructure and construct buildings using zero-emissions materials. Additionally, urban planners can take advantage of green roofs, urban forests, rivers and lakes to help capture and store carbon, as well as provide other climate benefits such as cleaner air and <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/are-we-ready-deadly-heat-waves-future">local cooling to counter urban heat waves</a> (<em>SN: 4/3/18</em>).&nbsp;</p>



<p>Meanwhile, “reducing emissions in industry will involve using materials and energy more efficiently, reusing and recycling products and minimizing waste,” Diana Ürge-Vorsatz, the vice chair of the IPCC’s Working Group III, said at the news event.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As for agriculture and forestry, these and other land-use industries contribute about 22 percent of the world’s greenhouse gas emissions, with half of those <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/planting-trees-protect-forests-climate-change">emissions coming from deforestation</a> (<em>SN: 7/13/21)</em>. So <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/planting-trees-climate-change-carbon-capture-deforestation">reforestation </a>and <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/africa-great-green-wall-trees-sahel-climate-change">reduced deforestation</a> are key to flipping the balance between CO₂ emissions and removal from the atmosphere (<em>SN: 7/9/21</em>; <em>SN: 1/3/22</em>). But there are a lot of other strategies that the world can employ at the same time, the report emphasizes. Better management of forests, coastal wetlands, grasslands and other ecosystems, more sustainable crop and livestock management, soil carbon management in agriculture and <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/trees-crops-agroforestry-climate-biodiversity">agroforestry</a> can all bring down emissions (<em>SN: 7/14/21</em>).&nbsp;</p>



<p>The report also includes, for the first time in the IPCC’s reports, a chapter on the “untapped potential” of lifestyle changes to reduce emissions. Such changes include <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/climate-change-actions-reduce-carbon-footprint">opting for walking or cycling or using public transportation</a> rather than driving, shifting toward plant-based diets and reducing air travel (<em>SN: 5/14/20</em>).&nbsp;</p>



<p>Those lifestyle changes could reduce emissions by 40 to 70 percent by 2050, the report suggests. To enable those changes, however, government policies, infrastructure and technology would need to be in place.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Government policies are also key to financing these transformational changes. Globally, the investment in climate-related technologies needs to ramp up, and quickly, to limit warming below 2 degrees C, the report states. Right now, investments are three to six times lower than they need to be by 2030. And a combination of public and private investments will be essential to aiding the transition away from fossil fuels and toward <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/africa-growing-power-grid-cheap-renewable-energy-fuel-emissions">renewable energy in developing nations</a> (<em>SN: 1/25/21</em>).&nbsp;</p>



<h4>Future strategies</h4>



<p>Still, reducing emissions alone won’t be enough: We will need to actively remove carbon from the atmosphere to achieve net zero emissions and keep the planet well below 2 degrees C of warming, the report notes. “One thing that&#8217;s clear in this report, as opposed to previous reports, is that carbon removal is going to be necessary in the near term,” says Simon Nicholson, director of the Institute for Carbon Removal Law and Policy at American University in Washington, D.C., who was not involved in the report.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Such strategies include existing approaches such as protecting or restoring carbon dioxide–absorbing forests, but also <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/climate-change-target-top-science-stories-2018-yir">technologies that are not yet widely available</a> commercially, such as directly capturing carbon dioxide from the air, or converting the gas to a mineral form and storing it underground (<em>SN: 12/17/18</em>).&nbsp;</p>



<p>These options are still in their infancy, and we don’t know how much of an impact they’ll have yet, Nicholson says. “We need massive investment now in research.”</p>



<p>An emphasis on acting “now,” on eliminating further delay, on the urgency of the moment has been a recurring theme through all three sections of the IPCC’s sixth assessment report released over the last year. What impact these scientists’ stark statements will have is unclear.</p>



<p>But “the jury has reached a verdict, and it is damning,” U.N. Secretary-General Guterres said. “If you care about justice and our children’s future, I am appealing directly to you.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2022/04/scholl-and-kolling/">Exploring how apathy and compulsivity can shape decision-making</a></h4>

              
                <p>In their new preregistered research article, &ldquo;<a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.3001566">The effect of apathy and compulsivity on planning and stopping in sequential decision-making</a>,&rdquo;&nbsp; Jacqueline Scholl and Nils Kolling, both of Oxford University, explore how behavioral traits associated with various illnesses can affect real-world behavior when performing tasks and making complex decisions&mdash;in this case, searching for, applying to, and deciding whether to accept a new job.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Importantly, the authors chose to publish their study as a <a href="https://plos-marketing.s3.amazonaws.com/Marketing/Biology+Preregistered+Articles+Guidelines+for+Authors.pdf">Preregistered Research Article</a> with <em>PLOS Biology</em>. In this model, authors submit a design for a confirmatory study, together with preliminary results from any exploratory investigation, for peer review. Following review and revision of the study design, research projects may be provisionally accepted for publication after the results and analysis are completed.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Below, read excerpts from a <a href="https://biologue.plos.org/2022/04/01/scholl-and-kolling/">longer interview</a> with the authors, discussing their hypotheses and results, next steps for the research, and their decision to preregister.</p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator">



<p><strong>Interviewer: </strong><strong><em>You and your coauthors have recently published a research article in </em></strong><strong>PLOS Biology</strong><strong><em>, in which you use job search behavior to explore how sequential decision-making is affected by apathy and compulsion. Can you tell us at a high level what your investigation entailed, and what inspired you to pursue this line of inquiry?</em></strong></p>



<div class="wp-block-image is-style-default"><figure class="alignleft size-medium"><img loading="lazy" width="300" height="250" src="https://theplosblog.plos.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2022/03/JScholl-blog-image-copy-300x250.png" alt="Jacqueline Scholl" class="wp-image-20233" srcset="https://theplosblog.plos.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2022/03/JScholl-blog-image-copy-300x250.png 300w, https://theplosblog.plos.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2022/03/JScholl-blog-image-copy-1024x853.png 1024w, https://theplosblog.plos.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2022/03/JScholl-blog-image-copy-768x640.png 768w, https://theplosblog.plos.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2022/03/JScholl-blog-image-copy.png 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px"></figure></div>



<p><strong>JS:</strong> In the past psychology experiments aimed to be as simple as possible. However, this often misses out on many complexities that people actually need to deal with in daily life. We hypothesized that these more &ldquo;real life&rdquo; situations are also when psychiatric traits &ndash; like apathy &ndash;show up more clearly. Our work here is in line with a more &lsquo;ecological approach&rsquo; which takes inspiration from real-life situations that need to be solved and uses computational modeling to capture the complexities.</p>



<p>The specific complexity that we were interested in here is how people plan ahead when they need to think about making a series of decisions &ndash; like searching for a job. This often entails going through a sequence of getting offers and deciding whether to accept or reject them. While we had previously investigated the brain mechanisms of the general decision making and planning processes, in this study we identified several clinical dimensions which might manifest in sequential decision making changes. For example, we hypothesized that apathy might lead people to keep searching for too long because they get &lsquo;stuck in a rut&rsquo; (&lsquo;decision inertia&rsquo;). And that compulsivity might also lead to searching for too long, but for a different reason, namely being insensitive to the costs searching entails.</p>



<p><strong>NK: </strong>Another key inspiration for our study was related to introspection. Generally, decision making studies do not ask participants about their own reasoning for their behavior but fit models to their behavior instead. They do so in the belief that &ldquo;actions speak louder than words&rdquo;. However, when it comes to clinical changes some of those changes are about how we &ldquo;feel&rdquo; and think about our behavior, not just what we do. This is why it&rsquo;s so exciting to look at BOTH what people do and what they think together and compare them.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Interviewer: </strong><strong><em>And why did you choose to preregister this study? What, if anything, can journals do to encourage preregistration and/or make it easier to do?</em></strong></p>



<div class="wp-block-image is-style-default"><figure class="alignright size-medium"><img loading="lazy" width="300" height="250" src="https://theplosblog.plos.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2022/03/NKollberg-blog-image-300x250.png" alt="Nils Kolling" class="wp-image-20234" srcset="https://theplosblog.plos.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2022/03/NKollberg-blog-image-300x250.png 300w, https://theplosblog.plos.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2022/03/NKollberg-blog-image-1024x853.png 1024w, https://theplosblog.plos.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2022/03/NKollberg-blog-image-768x640.png 768w, https://theplosblog.plos.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2022/03/NKollberg-blog-image.png 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px"></figure></div>



<p><strong>NK:</strong> When you want to combine a complex task with clinical and real-life dimensions as well as self-reflective report measures about their own behavior, you need a new analysis approach to match your ambitions. Specifically, the sheer amount of potential associations when it comes to a sophisticated cognitive model that can measure multiple cognitive features and multiple clinical dimensions means you need a way to narrow down the hypothesis space.</p>



<p><strong>JS: </strong>In such a situation, it&rsquo;s incredibly powerful to collect two samples as we did here with a &lsquo;discovery sample&rsquo; (roughly 400 participants) / &lsquo;confirmation sample&rsquo; (750 participants). A major advantage of this approach is that we could be guided by the data in generating precise hypotheses about clinical dimensions (in the discovery sample). Yet at the same time, we could avoid any potential statistical pitfalls to do with explorations (e.g. p-hacking) through pre-registration before collecting the confirmation sample.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>NK:</strong> Offering pre-registrations in well-respected journals, like <em>PLOS Biology</em>, is a major step forward for visibility of pre-reg studies. We hope that our study can play a role in showing other researchers how pre-reg and discovery/confirmation approaches can empower [researchers] to answer new questions with new approaches.</p>



<p><strong>Interviewer: </strong><strong><em>For readers who may not know, in preregistered research, authors begin by first articulating a hypothesis, study design and analytical approach, which is then submitted for peer review. In your case you actually tested three hypotheses! What was it like to receive comments so early in the process, and how do you think that early peer review may have influenced the study you conducted?</em></strong></p>



<p><strong>JS:</strong> For our specific case, the review process was quite similar to standard peer review because we had a sizeable &lsquo;discovery sample&rsquo; on which it was based. In fact, in the past, the discovery sample would have been for most researchers the only sample they had in the paper. Our huge advantage now was that we could boost our confidence in the validity of the findings through the confirmation sample.</p>



<p>One major advantage compared to standard peer-review was that when reviewers made sensible suggestions about additional control variables to collect, we could actually implement this; rather than just thinking &lsquo;we wished we had done that&rsquo;.</p>



<p><strong>NK: </strong>For other types of pre-reg studies, that are earlier in the process, a lot more feedback can go into initial design, analysis and planning, showing what a large spectrum of pre-reg reports are possible!</p>



<p><strong>Interviewer: </strong><strong><em>Turning back to the research itself now, you explored two traits associated with a broad range of illnesses: apathy, which can be linked to depression, brain injury, neurodegenerative disorders, and other factors; and compulsivity, which is a core feature of OCD. On the surface to someone who&rsquo;s not an expert in the field, apathy and compulsivity may appear to be opposites. Why does it make sense to study them in tandem?</em></strong></p>



<p><strong>JS: </strong>Being able to look at different psychiatrically traits at the same time is a key advantage of the kind of large online studies we have done here. The reason that this is important is that many psychiatric traits are correlated. For example, in a sample of patients with OCD [obsessive compulsive disorder], many would also have other diagnoses. This makes controlling for related but distinct clinical dimensions key. If one instead recruits patients with only OCD, these patients would be quite unrepresentative of the overall patient population.</p>



<p>Taking advantage of the ease of data collection over the internet, we could get hundreds of participants to allow us to statistically dissociate the different psychiatric traits using a &lsquo;transdiagnostic approach&rsquo;. This means that, instead of splitting participants into groups according to diagnostic categories, we measured how much of each trait (e.g. apathy or compulsivity) each person has. And then in turn we could link these traits uniquely to differences in behavior (controlling for other traits).</p>



<p><strong>NK: </strong>Importantly, our clinical dimensions were established empirically from questionnaire measures that covered a wide range of clinical questions/features. Thus, we can say that apathy and compulsivity are not the exact opposite from each other, as they otherwise would have been absorbed into one clinical dimension. In our study, both dimensions also appeared to lead to quite different changes. Apathy led to quite specific behavioral change in decision inertia but no corresponding change in insight. On the other hand, compulsivity came with a series of meta-cognitive or self-reported changes, but relatively little behavioral effects in our task.&nbsp;</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/pandemic-covid-normal-air-quality-clean-indoor">We can do better than what was ‘normal’ before the pandemic</a></h4>

              
                <p>It’s a weird time in the pandemic. COVID-19 cases are once again climbing in some parts of the United States, but still falling from the January surge in other places. The omicron subvariant&nbsp;<a href="https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#variant-proportions">BA.2 is now dominant in the country</a>, accounting for more than 50 percent of new cases in the week ending March 26, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.</p>



<p>BA.2 has already taken parts of the world by storm, spurring <a href="https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/map.html">large outbreaks in Europe and Asia</a>. With the rising spread of the subvariant in the United States, signs are pointing to another COVID-19 wave here, although it’s unclear how big it could be. There is a good amount of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMc2201849">immunity from vaccination and infections from other omicron siblings</a>&nbsp;to help flatten the next peak. But the highly transmissible subvariant is advancing at a time when many have tossed masks aside.</p>



<p>I can’t help but feel that we’re sitting ducks. There’s no movement yet to reinstate protective measures to prepare for the coming wave. Instead, there are loud calls to “return to normal.” But even though it’s been two years, this pandemic isn’t over, no matter how much we wish it were. And when people talk about “normal,” I am struck by what&nbsp;<em>can’t</em>&nbsp;be “normal” again.</p>

<p>For millions and millions of people who have lost children, partners, parents and friends, life won’t be the same. One study reported that the “mortality shock” of COVID-19 has&nbsp;<a href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2007476117?utm_source=Coronavirus_Update&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=cvupdate03302022">left nine people bereaved for every one U.S. death</a>.&nbsp;So for the more than 975,000 who have died of COVID-19 in the United States, there are close to 9 million who are grieving. Although the study didn’t calculate the ratio globally, more than 6 million have died worldwide, undoubtedly leaving tens of millions bereaved. At the global scale, researchers estimate that through October 2021, more than&nbsp;<a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/covid-children-parent-caregiver-loss-death-5-million">5 million children have lost a parent or caregiver</a>&nbsp;to COVID-19, putting these children’s health, development and future education at risk (<em>SN: 2/24/22</em>).</p>



<p>Adding to the loss, the pandemic robbed many people of the chance to be with their loved ones as they died or to gather for a funeral. Psychiatrists are concerned that cases of&nbsp;<a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamapsychiatry/article-abstract/2788766">prolonged grief disorder could rise</a>,&nbsp;considering the scale of this mass mourning event.</p>



<p>Many millions who weathered an infection with SARS-CoV-2 went on to develop debilitating symptoms from long COVID, preventing their return to “normal.” A recent report from the U.S. Government Accountability Office estimates that&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gao.gov/products/gao-22-105666">7.7 to 23 million people</a>&nbsp;in the United States may have developed the condition. Worldwide, an&nbsp;<a href="https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.11.15.21266377v1">estimated 100 million people</a>&nbsp;currently have, or have had, long-term symptoms from COVID-19, researchers reported in a preprint study last November. Many with long COVID can&nbsp;<a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/investigations/got-long-covid-cost-dearly-rcna17942">no longer work and are struggling to get financial assistance</a> in the United States.&nbsp;Some have&nbsp;<a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/culture-features/long-covid-homeless-chronic-illness-gig-economy-1312460/">lost their homes</a>.</p>



<p>And as masking and vaccine mandates have fallen away, people with compromised immune systems have no choice but to fend for themselves and remain vigilant about restricting their interactions. People taking drugs that suppress the immune system or who have immune system disorders <a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/langlo/article/PIIS2214-109X(21)00593-3/fulltext">can’t muster much protection, if any, following vaccination</a> against the coronavirus. And if they get COVID-19, their weakened defenses put them at risk of more severe disease.</p>

<p>With all that people have endured — and continue to endure — during the pandemic, it would be a colossal missed opportunity to throw aside what we’ve learned from this experience. The pandemic brought wider attention to&nbsp;<a href="https://www.healthaffairs.org/doi/full/10.1377/hlthaff.2021.01439">how racism fuels health disparities</a>&nbsp;in the United States and renewed calls to make more progress dismantling inequities. With remote work and virtual school, many people with disabilities have gained important accommodations. The argument that&nbsp;<a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/15248399211014490">internet access is a social determinant of health</a>&nbsp;has been reinforced: Places that&nbsp;<a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2789619">had limited access to broadband internet</a>&nbsp;were associated with higher COVID-19 mortality rates in the United States, researchers reported this month in&nbsp;<em>JAMA Network Open</em>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The pandemic could also provide the push to bring indoor air under public health’s wing, joining common goods like water and food. The recognition that&nbsp;<a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coronvirus-covid-airborne-public-health-agencies">the virus that causes COVID-19 is primarily spread through the air</a>&nbsp;has also been a reminder of the airborne risk posed by other respiratory diseases, including influenza and tuberculosis (<em>SN: 12/16/21</em>). Improved ventilation — bringing fresh outdoor air inside — can&nbsp;<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-019-38825-y">temper an influenza outbreak</a>,&nbsp;and it helped to&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7217216/">control a real-world tuberculosis outbreak</a>&nbsp;in Taiwan.</p>



<p>Paying attention to indoor air quality has also paid dividends during the COVID-19 pandemic. Schools that&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/70/wr/mm7021e1.htm">combined better ventilation with high-efficiency filters</a>&nbsp;reduced the incidence of COVID-19 by 48 percent compared with schools that didn’t, researchers reported last year. This month, the Fondazione David Hume released not-yet-peer-reviewed results of an experiment in the Marche Region in Italy that looked&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fondazionehume.it/data-analysis/controlled-mechanical-ventilation-cmv-works/">at schools with and without controlled mechanical ventilation</a>&nbsp;and the impact of different rates of air exchange. Replacing the air in a classroom 2.4 times per hour reduced the risk of COVID-19 spread by a factor of 1.7. More frequent exchanges reduced the risk even more, up to a factor of 5.7 with replacement 6 times an hour.</p>

<p>British scientists who advise the U.K. government would like buildings to&nbsp;<a href="https://www.independentsage.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Independent-SAGE-SotD-March-2022-FINAL-3-1.pdf">display signs to inform the public of the status of the air inside</a>.&nbsp;They have developed prototype placards with different icons and color-coding schemes to convey information such as whether a room is mechanically ventilated, uses filtration or monitors carbon dioxide, which is a proxy for how much fresh air a room gets. The group is testing options in a pilot program.</p>



<p>In the United States, the White House has launched the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2022/03/17/fact-sheet-biden-administration-launches-effort-to-improve-ventilation-and-reduce-the-spread-of-covid-19-in-buildings/">Clean Air in Buildings Challenge</a>&nbsp;as part of the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/covidplan/">National COVID-19 Preparedness Plan</a>.&nbsp;The Biden administration and Congress have made federal funding available to improve air quality in schools, public buildings and other structures. The Environmental Protection Agency has released&nbsp;<a href="https://www.epa.gov/system/files/documents/2022-03/508-cleanairbuildings_factsheet_v5_508.pdf">recommendations on how to plan for and take action on indoor air quality</a>.</p>



<p>“Healthy and clean indoor air should become an expectation for all of us,” Alondra Nelson, head of the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy, said at a webinar about the new initiatives on March 29. “It’s just as important as the food we eat and the water we drink.”</p>



<p>Making clean indoor air a public health priority, and putting in the work and money to make it a reality across the country, would go a long way to helping us prepare for infectious disease outbreaks to come. It also reinforces the&nbsp;<em>public</em>&nbsp;in public health, a commitment to protecting as many people as possible, just as masking mandates at appropriate times do. It’s how we get to some kind of “normal” that everyone can share in.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/binary-stars-black-hole-astronomy">Binary stars keep masquerading as black holes</a></h4>

              
                <p>As astronomy datasets grow larger, scientists are scouring them for black holes, hoping to better understand the exotic objects. But the drive to find more black holes is leading some astronomers astray.</p>



<p>“You say black holes are like a needle in a haystack, but suddenly we have way more haystacks than we did before,” says astrophysicist Kareem El-Badry of the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics in Cambridge, Mass. “You have better chances of finding them, but you also have more opportunities to find things that look like them.”</p>



<p>Two more claimed black holes have turned out to be the latter: weird things that look like them. They both are <a href="https://academic.oup.com/mnras/advance-article-abstract/doi/10.1093/mnras/stac815/6553842?redirectedFrom=fulltext">actually double-star systems at never-before-seen stages in their evolutions</a>, El-Badry and his colleagues report March 24 in <em>Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society</em>. The key to understanding the systems is figuring out how to interpret light coming from them, the researchers say. &nbsp;</p>





<p>In early 2021, astronomer Tharindu Jayasinghe of Ohio State University and his colleagues reported finding a star system — affectionately named the <a href="https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article/504/2/2577/6261635">Unicorn</a> — about 1,500 light-years&nbsp;from Earth that they thought held a giant red star in its senior years orbiting an invisible black hole. Some of the same researchers, including Jayasinghe, later reported a second similar system, dubbed the <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.11131">Giraffe</a>, found about 12,000 light-years away.</p>



<p>But other researchers, including El-Badry, weren’t convinced that the systems harbored black holes. So Jayasinghe, El-Badry and others combined forces to reanalyze the data.</p>



<p>To verify each star system’s nature, the researchers turned to stellar spectra, the rainbows that are produced when starlight is split up into its component wavelengths. Any star’s spectrum will have lines where atoms in the stellar atmosphere have absorbed particular wavelengths of light. A slow-spinning star has very sharp lines, but a fast-spinning one has blurred and smeared lines.</p>



<p>“If the star spins fast enough, basically all the spectral features become almost invisible,” El-Badry says. “Normally, you detect a second star in a spectrum by looking for another set of lines,” he adds. “And that&#8217;s harder to do if a star is rapidly rotating.”</p>



<p>That’s why Jayasinghe and colleagues misunderstood each of these systems initially, the team found.</p>



<p>“The problem was that there was not just one star, but a second one that was basically hiding,” says astrophysicist Julia Bodensteiner of the European Southern Observatory in Garching, Germany, who was not involved in the new study. That second star in each system spins very fast, which makes them difficult to see in the spectra.</p>



<p>What’s more, the lines in the spectrum of a star orbiting something will shift back and forth, El-Badry says. If one assumes the spectrum shows just one average, slow-spinning star in an orbit — which is what appeared to be happening in these systems at first glance — that assumption then leads to the erroneous conclusion that the star is orbiting an invisible black hole.</p>



<p>Instead, the Unicorn and Giraffe each hold two stars, caught in a never-before-seen stage of stellar evolution, the researchers found after reanalyzing the data. Both systems contain an older red giant star with a puffy atmosphere and a “subgiant,” a star on its way to that late-life stage. The subgiants are near enough to their companion red giants that they are gravitationally stealing material from them. As these subgiants accumulate more mass, they spin faster, El-Badry says, which is what made them undetectable initially.</p>



<p>“Everyone was looking for really interesting black holes, but what they found is really interesting binaries,” Bodensteiner says.</p>



<p>These are not the only systems to trick astronomers recently. What was thought to be the nearest black hole to Earth <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/earth-nearest-black-hole-star-system-binary-space">also turned out to be pair of stars</a> in a rarely seen stage of evolution (<em>SN: 3/11/22</em>).</p>



<p>“Of course, it&#8217;s disappointing that what we thought were black holes were actually not, but it&#8217;s part of the process,” Jayasinghe says. He and his colleagues are still looking for black holes, he says, but with a greater awareness of how pairs of interacting stars might trick them.</p>

                <p><em>By</em> <a href="https://twitter.com/mattbwarren">Matthew Warren</a></p>



<p>The environment in which you grew up can have a long-lasting effect on your navigational skills, according to an analysis of data from nearly 400,000 players of a mobile game.</p>



<p>People who spent their childhood in rural or suburban areas tended to be better at navigating in the game Sea Hero Quest than those who grew up in cities. This difference could be seen decades later, the researchers <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-022-04486-7">report in <em>Nature</em></a>, and was particularly striking in countries where cities are organised in a grid layout.</p>



<span id="more-45908"></span>



<p>Antoine Coutrot from the University of Lyon and colleagues looked at data from 397,162 people from 38 countries who had played <a href="https://www.alzheimersresearchuk.org/research/for-researchers/resources-and-information/sea-hero-quest/">Sea Hero Quest</a>. &nbsp;This game involves navigating a boat around ocean environments, and was developed by scientists and Alzheimer’s Research UK to study human spatial navigation, one of the first skills to be affected by dementia. &nbsp;</p>



<p>The researchers were interested in the game’s “wayfaring” levels, in which players first see a map of the environment which shows several numbered checkpoints. The map then disappears, and they have to navigate the environment to visit those checkpoints in the correct order. Performance was assessed based on the length of the route players took. Players also reported demographic information, such as age, gender, country, and whether they grew up in a city or in suburban or rural areas.</p>



<p>The team found that younger and more educated players tended to be better at the game, and that men tended to be better than women. But the really interesting finding related to where people were brought up: those who had spent their childhood outside of cities were better at the game than those who had grown up within cities.</p>



<p>These results suggest that people who grow up in more rural areas develop better navigational abilities. But, crucially, the finding wasn’t consistent across countries. For nations like the United States and Argentina, there was a clear benefit of growing up outside of cities, but this effect wasn’t as strong in countries like Austria or Indonesia.</p>



<p>The researchers reasoned that the layout of city streets in each country could be an important factor. In countries like the United States, major cities are usually planned out in a grid fashion, making them easy to navigate — so it would make sense that people who grew up in these cities didn’t develop the same navigational abilities as people who grew up in more complex rural environments. But in countries like Austria, cities tended to develop organically over time, and as a result have more winding roads jutting off from each other at irregular angles. Growing up in these cities may have honed people’s navigational abilities just as much as growing up in rural areas.</p>



<p>To test this idea, the researchers analysed city maps to calculate the overall “entropy” of the city street networks in each country — essentially how ordered versus complex they were. As the team had predicted, in countries where city street networks were more grid-like and orderly, people who grew up in rural or suburban areas tended be better at Sea Hero Quest than those who grew up in the city. But this advantage was diminished in countries with more complex city street networks.  </p>



<p>If you grew up in a city designed as a grid, it’s not all bad news. The team found that people from these cities had an advantage in one area: navigating levels that were themselves more grid-like.</p>



<p>“These results support the idea that humans develop navigation strategies that are aligned with the type of environment they are exposed to, which become suboptimal in other environments,” the authors conclude.</p>



<p>The study is not without limitations. In particular, players only noted their home country, and not the specific city or region they came from. This meant that the researchers had to look at a single overall measure of how orderly city street networks were in each country, and couldn’t compare the performance of people from individual cities <em>within </em>countries. Yet even within nations there are clearly differences in city layouts: compare the grid of Barcelona with the more complex street layout of San Sebastian, for instance, or the higgledy-piggledy lanes of Oxford with the right angles of Milton Keynes. Perhaps future work will be able to look in more fine-grained detail at the fascinating effects that urban design appears to have on our cognitive abilities.  </p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/global-warming-pause-climate-change-science-early-2000s">A global warming pause that didn’t happen hampered climate science</a></h4>

              
                <p>It was one of the biggest climate change questions of the early 2000s: Had the planet’s rising fever stalled, even as humans pumped more heat-trapping gases into Earth’s atmosphere?</p>



<p>By the turn of the century, the scientific <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/century/climate-change-carbon-dioxide-greenhouse-gas-emissions-global-warming">understanding of climate change was on firm footing</a>. Decades of research showed that carbon dioxide was accumulating in Earth’s atmosphere, thanks to human activities like burning fossil fuels and cutting down carbon-storing forests, and that global temperatures were rising as a result. Yet weather records seemed to show that global warming slowed between around 1998 and 2012. How could that be?</p>

<p>After careful study, scientists found the apparent pause to be a hiccup in the data. Earth had, in fact, continued to warm. This hiccup, though, prompted an outsize response from climate skeptics and scientists. It serves as a case study for how public perception shapes what science gets done, for better or worse.</p>



<p>The mystery of what came to be called the “global warming hiatus” arose as scientists built up, year after year, data on the planet’s average surface temperature. Several organizations maintain their own temperature datasets; each relies on observations gathered at weather stations and from ships and buoys around the globe. The actual amount of warming varies from year to year, but overall the trend is going up, and record-hot years are becoming more common. The <a href="https://www.ipcc.ch/site/assets/uploads/2018/02/ipcc_sar_wg_I_full_report.pdf">1995 Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change report</a>, for instance, noted that recent years had been among the warmest recorded since 1860.</p>



<p>And then came the powerful El Niño of 1997–1998, a weather pattern that transferred large amounts of heat from the ocean into the atmosphere. The planet’s temperature soared as a result —&nbsp;but then, according to the weather records, it appeared to slacken dramatically. Between 1998 and 2012, the global average surface temperature rose <a href="https://www.ipcc.ch/site/assets/uploads/2018/03/WG1AR5_SummaryVolume_FINAL.pdf">at less than half the rate it did between 1951 and 2012</a>. That didn’t make sense. Global warming should be accelerating over time as people ramp up the rate at which they add heat-trapping gases to the atmosphere.</p>

<p>By the mid-2000s, climate skeptics had seized on the narrative that “global warming has stopped.” Most professional climate scientists were not studying the phenomenon, since most believed the apparent pause fell within the range of natural temperature variability. But public attention soon caught up to them, and researchers began investigating whether the pause was a real thing. It was a high-profile shift in scientific focus.</p>



<p>“In studying that anomalous period, we learned a lot of lessons about both the climate system and the scientific process,” says Zeke Hausfather, a climate scientist now with the technology company Stripe.</p>



<p>By the early 2010s, scientists were busily working to explain why the global temperature records seemed to be flatlining. Ideas included the contribution of <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/sulfur-stalls-surface-temperature-rise">cooling sulfur particles emitted by coal-burning power plants</a> and <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/multiple-oceans-may-help-stall-global-warming">heat being taken up by the Atlantic and Southern oceans</a>. Such studies were the most focused attempt ever to understand the factors that drive year-to-year temperature variability. They revealed how much natural variability can be expected when factors such as a powerful El Niño are superimposed onto a long-term warming trend.</p>



<p>Scientists spent years investigating the purported warming pause —&nbsp;devoting more time and resources than they otherwise might have. So many papers were published on the apparent pause that scientists began joking that the journal <em>Nature Climate Change</em> should change its name to <em>Nature Hiatus</em>.</p>





<p>Then in 2015, a team led by researchers at the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration published <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/global-warming-hiatus-just-artifact-study-finds">a jaw-dropping conclusion in the journal <em>Science</em></a>. The rise in global temperatures had not plateaued; rather, incomplete data had obscured ongoing global warming. When more Arctic temperature records were included and biases in ocean temperature data were corrected, the NOAA dataset showed the heat-up continuing. With the newly corrected data, the apparent pause in global warming vanished. A <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.1601207">2017 study</a> led by Hausfather confirmed and extended these findings, as did <a href="https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/aaf342">other reports</a>.</p>



<p>Even after these studies were published, the hiatus remained a favored topic among climate skeptics, who used it to argue that concern over global warming was overblown. Congressman Lamar Smith, a Republican from Texas who chaired the House of Representatives’ science committee in the mid-2010s, was particularly incensed by the 2015 NOAA study. He demanded to see the underlying data while also accusing NOAA of altering it. (The agency denied fudging the data.)</p>



<p>“In retrospect, it is clear that we focused too much on the apparent hiatus,” Hausfather says. Figuring out why global temperature records seemed to plateau between 1998 and 2012 is important — but so is keeping a big-picture view of the broader understanding of climate change. The hiccup represented a short fluctuation in a much longer and much more important trend.</p>

<p>Long-term climate datasets show that Earth’s average surface temperature (combined land and ocean) has increased by more than 1 degree Celsius since preindustrial times. Temperature change is the difference from the 1850–1900 average.</p>
</div>



<p>Science relies on testing hypotheses and questioning conclusions, but here’s a case where probing an anomaly was taken arguably too far. It caused researchers to doubt their conclusions and spend large amounts of time questioning their well-established methods, says Stephan Lewandowsky, a cognitive scientist at the University of Bristol who has studied climate scientists’ response to the hiatus. Scientists studying the hiatus could have been working instead on providing clear information to policy makers about the reality of global warming and the urgency of addressing it.</p>



<p>The debates over whether the hiatus was real or not fed public confusion and undermined efforts to convince people to take aggressive action to reduce climate change’s impacts. That’s an important lesson going forward, Lewandowsky says.</p>



<p>“My sense is that the scientific community has moved on,” he says. “By contrast, the political operatives behind organized denial have learned a different lesson, which is that the ‘global warming has stopped’ meme is very effective in generating public complacency, and so they will use it at every opportunity.”</p>



<p>Already, some climate deniers are talking about a new “pause” in global warming because not every one of the past five years has set a new record, he notes. Yet the big-picture trend remains clear: Global temperatures have continued to rise in recent years. The warmest seven years on record have all occurred since 2015, and each decade since the 1980s has been warmer than the one before.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/navigation-skills-childhood-city-grid-country">Where you grew up may shape your navigational skills</a></h4>

              
                <p>Score one for the country mouse.</p>



<p>People who grow up outside of cities are better at finding their way around than urbanites, a large study on navigation suggests. The results, described online March 30 in <em>Nature</em>, hint that learning to handle environmental complexity as a child <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-022-04486-7">strengthens mental muscles</a> for spatial skills.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Nearly 400,000 people from 38 countries around the world played a video game called Sea Hero Quest, designed by neuroscientists and game developers as a fun way to glean data about people’s brains. Players piloted a boat in search of various targets.</p>





<p>On average, people who said they had grown up outside of cities, where they would have presumably encountered lots of meandering paths, were better at finding the targets than people who were raised in cities.</p>





<p>What’s more, the difference between city dwellers and outsiders was most prominent in countries where cities tend to have simple, gridlike layouts, such as Chicago with its streets laid out at 90-degree angles. The simpler the cities, the bigger the advantage for people from more rural areas, cognitive scientist Antoine Coutrot of CNRS who is based in Lyon, France, and his colleagues report.</p>



<p>Still, from these video game data, scientists can’t definitively say that the childhood environment is behind the differences in navigation. But it’s plausible. “As a kid, if you are exposed to a complex environment, you learn to find your way, and you develop the right cognitive processes to do so,” Coutrot says.</p>



<p>Other bits of demography have been linked to navigational performance, including age, gender, education and even a <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/people-who-have-good-sense-smell-are-also-good-navigators">superior sense of smell</a> (<em>SN: 10/16/18</em>). Figuring out these details will give doctors a more precise baseline of a person’s navigational abilities. That, in turn, might help reveal when these skills slip, as they do in early Alzheimer’s disease, for instance.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/magellanic-clouds-star-formation-birth-galaxy">When the Magellanic Clouds cozy up to each other, stars are born</a></h4>

              
                <p>Like two great songwriters working side by side and inspiring each other to create their best work, the Magellanic Clouds spawn new stars every time the two galaxies meet.</p>



<p>Visible to the naked eye but best seen from the Southern Hemisphere, the Large and Small Magellanic Clouds are by far the most luminous of the many galaxies orbiting the Milky Way. New observations reveal that on multiple occasions the&nbsp;<a href="https://academic.oup.com/mnrasl/advance-article-abstract/doi/10.1093/mnrasl/slac030/6554248?redirectedFrom=fulltext">two bright galaxies have minted a rash of stars simultaneously</a>, researchers report March 25 in <em>Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society: Letters</em>. </p>



<p>Astronomer Pol Massana at the University of Surrey in England and his colleagues examined the Small Magellanic Cloud. Five peaks in the galaxy’s star formation rate — at 3 billion, 2 billion, 1.1 billion and 450 million years ago and at present — match similarly timed peaks in the Large Magellanic Cloud. That’s a sign that one galaxy triggers star formation in the other whenever the two dance close together.</p>





<p>“This is the most detailed star formation history that we’ve ever had of the [Magellanic] Clouds,” says Paul Zivick, an astronomer at Texas A&amp;M University in College Station who was not involved in the new work. “It’s painting a very compelling picture that these two have had a very intense set of interactions over the last two to three gigayears.”</p>



<p>Even as the <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/young-star-cluster-found-old-part-milky-way-galaxy">two galaxies orbit the Milky Way</a> at 160,000 and 200,000 light-years from Earth, they also orbit each other (<em>SN: 1/9/20</em>). Their orbit is elliptical, which means they periodically pass near each other. Just as tides from the moon’s gravity stir the seas, tides from one galaxy’s gravity slosh around the other’s gas, inducing star birth, says study coauthor Gurtina Besla, an astrophysicist at the University of Arizona in Tucson.</p>



<p>During the last encounter, which happened 100 million to 200 million years ago, the smaller galaxy probably smashed right through the larger, Besla says, which sparked the current outbreak of star birth. The <a href="https://www.aanda.org/articles/aa/pdf/2020/07/aa38392-20.pdf">last star formation peak in the Large Magellanic Cloud</a> occurred only in its northern section, so she says that’s probably where the collision took place.</p>



<p>Based on the star formation peaks, the period between Magellanic encounters has decreased from a billion to half a billion years. Besla attributes this to a process known as dynamical friction. As the Small Magellanic Cloud orbits its mate, it passes through the larger galaxy’s dark halo, attracting a wake of dark matter behind itself. The gravitational pull of this dark matter wake slows the smaller galaxy, shrinking its orbit and reducing how much time it takes to revolve around the Large Magellanic Cloud.</p>



<p>The future for the two galaxies may not be so starry, however. They recently came the closest they’ve ever been to the Milky Way, and its tides, Besla says, have probably yanked the pair apart. If so, the Magellanic Clouds, now separated by 75,000 light-years, may never approach each other again, putting an end to their most productive episodes of star making, just as musicians sometimes flounder after leaving bandmates to embark on solo careers.</p>

                A group of neuroscientists in Germany and Hungary is calling for the retraction of two of their recent papers after discovering a fatal error in the research.&#160; Myriam Sander, a memory researcher at the Max Planck Institute for Human Development in Berlin, took to social media on Wednesday to alert her followers to the decision. &#8230; <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2022/04/01/doing-the-right-thing-neuroscientists-announce-retractions-in-the-most-difficult-tweet-ever/" class="more-link">Continue reading <span class="screen-reader-text">Doing the right thing: Neuroscientist announces retractions in &#8216;the most difficult tweet ever&#8217;</span></a>

This is a rather stunning degree of symptom heterogeneity, and much more complicated than the <b>Infographic</b> suggests. It might even limit the usefulness of these diagnostic categories, which may be true of psychiatric diagnoses in general (see <a href="https://www.nimh.nih.gov/research/research-funded-by-nimh/rdoc/about-rdoc" target="_blank">RDoC</a>). <br /><br />Here is where computational methods may assist with understanding symptom profiles and trajectories of grief (<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34261030" target="_blank">Malgaroli et al., 2022</a>). Data driven analyses using unsupervised machine learning methods can identify patterns within the heterogeneity. Network analyses have identified the centrality of loneliness (<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25730514/" target="_blank">Fried et al., 2015</a>) and a social/identity symptom cluster that includes role confusion and meaninglessness (<a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/psychological-medicine/article/abs/symptoms-of-persistent-complex-bereavement-disorder-depression-and-ptsd-in-a-conjugally-bereaved-sample-a-network-analysis/0E8F5F15FDA0AA6AB87892F77A0284D4" target="_blank">Malgaroli et al., 2018</a>).

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/human-genome-complete-dna-genetics">We finally have a fully complete human genome</a></h4>

              
                <p>Researchers have finally deciphered a complete human genetic instruction book from cover to cover.</p>



<p>The completion of the human genome has been announced a couple of times in the past, but those were actually incomplete drafts. “We really mean it this time,” says Evan Eichler, a human geneticist and Howard Hughes Medical Institute investigator at the University of Washington in Seattle.</p>



<p>The completed genome is presented in a series of papers published online March 31 in <em>Science</em> and <em>Nature Methods</em>.</p>





<p>An international team of researchers, including Eichler, used new DNA sequencing technology to untangle repetitive stretches of DNA that were redacted from an earlier version of the genome, widely used as a reference for guiding biomedical research. &nbsp;</p>



<p>Deciphering those tricky stretches <a href="http://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.abj6987">adds about 200 million DNA bases, about 8 percent of the genome</a>, to the instruction book, researchers report in <em>Science</em>. That’s essentially an entire chapter. And it’s a juicy one, containing the first-ever looks at the short arms of some chromosomes, long-lost genes and important parts of chromosomes called centromeres — where machinery responsible for divvying up DNA grips the chromosome.</p>



<p>“Some of the regions that were missing actually turn out to be the most interesting,” says Rajiv McCoy, a human geneticist at Johns Hopkins University, who was part of the team known as the Telomere-to-Telomere (T2T) Consortium assembling the complete genome. “It’s exciting because we get to take the first look inside these regions and see what we can find.” Telomeres are repetitive stretches of DNA found at the ends of chromosomes. Like aglets on shoelaces, they may help keep chromosomes from unraveling.</p>



<p>Data from the effort are already available for other researchers to explore. And some, like geneticist Ting Wang of Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis, have already delved in. “Having a complete genome reference definitely improves biomedical studies.… It’s an extremely useful resource,” he says. “There’s no question that this is an important achievement.”</p>



<p>But, Wang says, “the human genome isn’t quite complete yet.”</p>



<p>To understand why and what this new volume of the human genetic encyclopedia tells us, here’s a closer look at the milestone.</p>





<h4>What did the researchers do?</h4>



<p>Eichler is careful to point out that “this is the completion of <em>a</em> human genome. There is no such thing as <em>the</em> human genome.” Any two people will have large portions of their genomes that range from very similar to virtually identical and “smaller portions that are wildly different.” A reference genome can help researchers see where people differ, which can point to genes that may be involved in diseases. Having a view of the entire genome, with no gaps or hidden DNA, may give scientists a better understanding of human health, disease and evolution.</p>



<p>The newly complete genome doesn’t have gaps like the previous human reference genome. But it still has limitations, Wang says. The old reference genome is a <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/genetics-race-dna-databases-reference-genome-too-white">conglomerate of more than 60 people’s DNA</a> (<em>SN: 3/4/21</em>). “Not a single individual, or single cell on this planet, has that genome.” That goes for the new, complete genome, too. &nbsp;“It’s a quote-unquote fake genome,” says Wang, who was not involved with the project.</p>



<p>The new genome doesn’t come from a person either. It’s the genome of a complete hydatidiform mole, a sort of tumor that arises when a sperm fertilizes an empty egg and the father’s chromosomes are duplicated. The researchers chose to decipher the complete genome from a cell line called CHM13 made from one of these unusual tumors.</p>



<p>That decision was made for a technical reason, says geneticist Karen Miga of the University of California, Santa Cruz. Usually, people get one set of chromosomes from their mother and another set from their father. So “we all have two genomes in every cell.”</p>



<p>If putting together a genome is like assembling a puzzle, “you essentially have two puzzles in the same box that look very similar to each other,” says Miga, borrowing an analogy from a colleague. Researchers would have to sort the two puzzles before piecing them together. “Genomes from hydatidiform moles don’t present that same challenge. It’s just one puzzle in the box.”</p>



<p>The researchers did have to add the Y chromosome from another person, because the sperm that created the hydatidiform mole carried an X chromosome.</p>



<p>Even putting one puzzle together is a Herculean task. But new technologies that allow researchers to put DNA bases — represented by the letters A, T, C and G — in order, can spit out stretches up to more than 100,000 bases long. Just as children’s puzzles are easier to solve because of larger and fewer pieces, these “long reads” made assembling the bits of the genome easier, especially in repetitive parts where just a few bases might distinguish one copy from another. The bigger pieces also allowed researchers to correct some mistakes in the old reference genome.</p>



<h4>What did they find?</h4>



<p>For starters, the newly deciphered DNA contains the short arms of chromosomes 13, 14, 15, 21 and 22. These “acrocentric chromosomes” don’t resemble nice, neat X’s the way the rest of the chromosomes do. Instead, they have a set of long arms and one of  nubby short arms.</p>



<p>The length of the short arms belies their importance. These arms are home to rDNA genes, which encode rRNAs, which are key components of complex molecular machines called ribosomes. Ribosomes read genetic instructions and build all the proteins needed to make cells and bodies work. There are hundreds of copies of these rDNA regions in every person’s genome, an average of 315, but some people have more and some fewer. They’re important for making sure cells have protein-building factories at the ready.</p>



<p>“We didn’t know what to expect in these regions,” Miga says. “We found that every acrocentric chromosome, and every rDNA on that acrocentric chromosome, had variants, changes to the repeat unit that was private to that particular chromosome.”</p>



<p>By using fluorescent tags, Eichler and colleagues discovered that repetitive DNA next to the rDNA regions — and perhaps the rDNA too — sometimes <a href="http://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.abj6965">switches places to land on another chromosome</a>, the team reports in <em>Science</em>. “It’s like musical chairs,” he says. Why and how that happens is still a mystery.</p>



<p>The complete genome also contains 3,604 genes, including 104 that encode proteins, that weren’t present in the old, incomplete genome. Many of those genes are slightly different copies of previously known genes, including some that have been implicated in brain evolution and development, autism, immune responses, cancer and cardiovascular disease. Having a map of where all these genes lie may lead to a better understanding of what they do, and perhaps even of what makes humans human.</p>



<p>One of the biggest finds may be the structure of all of the human centromeres. Centromeres, the pinched portions which give most chromosomes their characteristic X shape, are the assembly points for kinetochores, the cellular machinery that divvies up DNA during cell division. That’s one of the most important jobs in a cell. When it goes wrong, birth defects, cancer or death can result. Researchers had already deciphered the <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/fruit-fly-jumping-gene-chromosome-centromere">centromeres of fruit flies</a> and the human 8, X and Y chromosomes (<em>SN: 5/17/19</em>), but this is the first time that researchers got a glimpse of the rest of the human centromeres.</p>



<p>The structures are mostly head-to-tail repeats of about 171 base pairs of DNA known as alpha satellites. But those repeats are nestled within other repeats, creating complex patterns that distinguish each chromosome’s individual centromere, Miga and colleagues describe in <em>Science</em>. Knowing the structures will help researchers learn more about how chromosomes are divvied up and what sometimes throws off the process.</p>

<p>Researchers also now have a more complete map of epigenetic marks — chemical tags on DNA or associated proteins that may change how genes are regulated. One type of epigenetic mark, known as DNA methylation, is fairly abundant across the centromeres, except for one spot in each chromosome called the <a href="http://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.abj5089">centromeric dip region</a>, Winston Timp, a biomedical engineer at Johns Hopkins University and colleagues report in <em>Science</em>.</p>



<p>Those dips are where kinetochores grab the DNA, the researchers discovered. But it&#8217;s not yet clear whether the dip in methylation causes the cellular machinery to assemble in that spot or if assembly of the machinery leads to lower levels of methylation.</p>



<p>Examining DNA methylation patterns in multiple people’s DNA and comparing them with the new reference revealed that the dips occur at different spots in each person’s centromeres, though the consequences of that aren’t known.</p>



<p>About half of genes implicated in the <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/genetic-tweaks-built-humans-bigger-brains">evolution of humans’ large, wrinkly brains</a> are found in multiple copies in the newly uncovered repetitive parts of the genome (<em>SN: 2/26/15</em>). Overlaying the epigenetic maps on the reference allowed researchers to figure out which of many copies of those genes were turned on and off, says Ariel Gershman, a geneticist at Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine.</p>



<p>“That gives us a little bit more insight into which of them are actually important and playing a functional role in the development of the human brain,” Gershman says. “That was exciting for us, because there’s never been a reference that was accurate enough in these [repetitive] regions to tell which gene was which, and which ones are turned on or off.”</p>



<h4>What is next?</h4>



<p>One criticism of genetics research is that it has relied too heavily on DNA from people of European descent. CHM13 also has European heritage. But researchers have used the new reference to discover new patterns of genetic diversity. Using DNA data collected from thousands of people of diverse backgrounds who participated in earlier research projects compared with the T2T reference, researchers <a href="http://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.abl3533">more easily and accurately found places where people differ</a>, McCoy and colleagues report in <em>Science</em>.</p>



<p>The Telomere-to-Telomere Consortium has now teamed up with Wang and his colleagues to make <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/first-human-genome-project-20th-anniversary-future">complete genomes of 350 people</a> from diverse backgrounds (<em>SN: 2/22/21</em>). That effort, known as the pangenome project, is poised to reveal some of its first findings later this year, Wang says.</p>



<p>McCoy and Timp say that it may take some time, but eventually, researchers may switch from using the old reference genome to the more complete and accurate T2T reference. “It’s like upgrading to a new version of software,” Timp says. “Not everyone is going to want to do it right away.”</p>



<p>The completed human genome will also be useful for researchers studying other organisms, says Amanda Larracuente, an evolutionary geneticist at the University of Rochester in New York who was not involved in the project. “What I’m excited about is the techniques and tools this team has developed, and being able to apply those to study other species.”</p>



<p>Eichler and others already have plans to make complete genomes of chimpanzees, bonobos and other great apes to learn more about how humans evolved differently than apes did. “No one should see this as the end,” Eichler says, “but a transformation, not only for genomic research but for clinical medicine, though that will take years to achieve.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/mammal-big-bodies-small-brains-dinosaur-extinction-fossils">Mammals’ bodies outpaced their brains right after the dinosaurs died</a></h4>

              
                <p>Modern mammals are known for their big brains. But new analyses of mammal skulls from creatures that lived shortly after the dinosaur mass extinction shows that those brains weren’t always a foregone conclusion. For at least 10 million years after the dinosaurs disappeared, <a href="http://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.abl5584">mammals got a lot brawnier but not brainier</a>, researchers report in the April 1 <em>Science</em>.</p>



<p>That bucks conventional wisdom, to put it mildly. “I thought, it’s not possible, there must be something that I did wrong,” says Ornella Bertrand, a mammal paleontologist at the University of Edinburgh. “It really threw me off. How am I going to explain that they were not smart?”</p>



<p>Modern mammals have the largest brains in the animal kingdom relative to their body size. How and when that brain evolution happened is a mystery. One idea has been that the disappearance of all nonbird dinosaurs following an asteroid impact at the end of the Mesozoic Era 66 million years ago <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/dinosaurs-out-way-mammals-had-chance-thrive">left a vacuum for mammals to fill</a> (<em>SN: 1/25/17</em>). Recent discoveries of <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/fossils-capture-mammals-recovery-after-dinosaur-killing-asteroid">fossils dating to the Paleocene</a> — the immediately post-extinction epoch spanning 66 million to 56 million years ago — does reveal a flourishing menagerie of weird and wonderful mammal species, many much bigger than their Mesozoic predecessors. It was the dawn of the Age of Mammals.</p>

<p>Before those fossil finds, the prevailing wisdom was that in the wake of the mass dino extinction, mammals’ brains most likely grew apace with their bodies, everything increasing together like an expanding balloon, Bertrand says. But those discoveries of Paleocene fossil troves in Colorado and New Mexico, as well as reexaminations of fossils previously found in France, are now unraveling that story, by offering scientists the chance to actually measure the size of mammals’ brains over time.</p>



<p>Bertrand and her colleagues used CT scanning to create 3-D images of the skulls of different types of ancient mammals from both before and after the extinction event. Those specimens included mammals from 17 groups dating to the Paleocene and 17 to the Eocene, the epoch that spanned 55 million to 34 million years ago. &nbsp;</p>





<p>What the team found was a shock: Relative to their body sizes, Paleocene mammal brains were relatively <em>smaller</em> than those of Mesozoic mammals. It wasn’t until the Eocene that mammal brains began to grow, particularly in certain sensory regions, the team reports.</p>



<p>To assess how the sizes and shapes of those sensory regions also changed over time, Bertrand looked for the edges of different parts of the brains within the 3-D skull models, tracing them like a sculptor working with clay. The size of mammals’ olfactory bulbs, responsible for sense of smell, didn’t change over time, the researchers found — and that makes sense, because even Mesozoic mammals were good sniffers, she says.</p>



<p>The really big brain changes were to come in the neocortex, which is responsible for visual processing, memory and motor control, among other skills. But those kinds of changes are metabolically costly, Bertrand says. “To have a big brain, you need to sleep and eat, and if you don’t do that you get cranky, and your brain just doesn’t function.”</p>

<p>So, the team proposes, as the world shook off the dust of the mass extinction, brawn was the priority for mammals, helping them swiftly spread out into newly available ecological niches. But after 10 million years or so, the metabolic calculations had changed, and competition within those niches was ramping up. As a result, mammals began to develop new sets of skills that could help them snag hard-to-reach fruit from a branch, escape a predator or catch prey.</p>



<p>Other factors — such as social behavior or parental care — have been important to the overall evolution of mammals’ big brains. But these new finds suggest that, at least at the dawn of the Age of Mammals, ecology — and competition between species — <a href="https://d.docs.live.net/fe69abf1aae813d2/Documents/Science%20News/Paleontology/10.1126/science.abo1985">gave a big push to brain evolution</a>, wrote biologist Felisa Smith of the University of New Mexico in Albuquerque in a commentary in the same issue of <em>Science</em>.</p>





<p>“An exciting aspect of these findings is that they raise a new question: Why did large brains evolve independently and concurrently in many mammal groups?” says evolutionary biologist David Grossnickle of the University of Washington in Seattle.</p>



<p>Most modern mammals have relatively large brains, so studies that examine only modern species might conclude that large brains evolved once in mammal ancestors, Grossnickle says. But what this study uncovered is a “much more interesting and nuanced story,” that these brains evolved separately in many different groups, he says. And that shows just how important fossils can be to stitching together an accurate tapestry of evolutionary history.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/scientific-imagination-failure-atoms-gravitational-waves-nuclear-power">Here are the Top 10 times scientific imagination failed</a></h4>

              
                <p>Science, some would say, is an enterprise that should concern itself solely with cold, hard facts. Flights of imagination should be the province of philosophers and poets.</p>



<p>On the other hand, as <a href="https://assets.press.princeton.edu/chapters/s6908.pdf">Albert Einstein so astutely observed</a>, “Imagination is more important than knowledge.” Knowledge, he said, is limited to what we know now, while “imagination embraces the entire world, stimulating progress.”</p>



<p>So with science, imagination has often been the prelude to transformative advances in knowledge, remaking humankind’s understanding of the world and enabling powerful new technologies.</p>





<p>And yet while sometimes spectacularly successful, imagination has also frequently failed in ways that retard the revealing of nature’s secrets. Some minds, it seems, are simply incapable of imagining that there’s more to reality than what they already know.</p>



<p>On many occasions scientists have failed to foresee ways of testing novel ideas, ridiculing them as unverifiable and therefore unscientific. Consequently it is not too challenging to come up with enough failures of scientific imagination to compile a Top 10 list, beginning with:</p>



<h4>10. Atoms</h4>



<p>By the middle of the 19th century, most scientists believed in atoms. Chemists especially. John Dalton had shown that the simple ratios of different elements making up chemical compounds strongly implied that each element consisted of identical tiny particles. Subsequent research on the weights of those atoms made their reality pretty hard to dispute. But that didn’t deter physicist-philosopher Ernst Mach. Even as late as the beginning of the 20th century, he and a number of others insisted that atoms could not be real, as they were not accessible to the senses. Mach believed that atoms were a “mental artifice,” convenient fictions that helped in calculating the outcomes of chemical reactions. “Have you ever seen one?” he would ask.</p>



<p>Apart from the fallacy of defining reality as “observable,” Mach’s main failure was his inability to imagine a way that atoms could be observed. Even after Einstein proved the existence of atoms by indirect means in 1905, Mach stood his ground. He was unaware, of course, of the 20th century technologies that quantum mechanics would enable, and so did not foresee powerful new microscopes that could show <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/individual-atoms-photographed">actual images of atoms</a> (and allow a certain computing company to <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/344524a0">drag them around</a> to spell out IBM).</p>



<h4>9. Composition of stars</h4>



<p>Mach’s views were similar to those of Auguste Comte, a French philosopher who originated the idea of positivism, which denies reality to anything other than objects of sensory experience. Comte’s philosophy led (and in some cases still leads) many scientists astray. His greatest failure of imagination was an example he offered for what science could never know: the chemical composition of the stars.</p>



<p>Unable to imagine anybody affording a ticket on some entrepreneur’s space rocket, Comte argued in 1835 that the identity of the stars’ components <a href="https://adsabs.harvard.edu/full/2010JAHH...13...90H">would forever remain beyond human knowledge</a>. We could study their size, shapes and movements, he said, “whereas we would never know how to study by any means their chemical composition, or their mineralogical structure,” or for that matter, their temperature, which “will necessarily always be concealed from us.”</p>



<p>Within a few decades, though, a newfangled technology called spectroscopy enabled astronomers to analyze the colors of light emitted by stars. And since each chemical element emits (or absorbs) precise colors (or frequencies) of light, each set of colors is like a chemical fingerprint, an infallible indicator for an element’s identity. Using a spectroscope to observe starlight therefore can reveal the chemistry of the stars, exactly what Comte thought impossible.</p>



<h4>8. Canals on Mars</h4>



<p>Sometimes imagination fails because of its overabundance rather than absence. In the case of the never-ending drama over the possibility of life on Mars, that planet’s famous canals turned out to be figments of overactive scientific imagination.</p>



<p>First “observed” in the late 19th century, the Martian canals showed up as streaks on the planet’s surface, described as <em>canali</em> by Italian astronomer Giovanni Schiaparelli. <em>Canali</em> is, however, Italian for channels, not canals. So in this case something was gained (rather than lost) in translation — the idea that Mars was inhabited. “Canals are dug,” <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/55546/55546-h/55546-h.htm#ASTRONOMY">remarked British astronomer Norman Lockyer in 1901</a>, “<em>ergo</em> there were diggers.” Soon astronomers imagined an elaborate system of canals transporting water from Martian poles to thirsty metropolitan areas and agricultural centers. (Some observers even imagined seeing canals on Venus and Mercury.)</p>

<p>With more constrained imaginations, aided by better telescopes and translations, belief in the Martian canals eventually faded. It was merely the Martian winds blowing dust (bright) and sand (dark) around the surface in ways that occasionally made bright and dark streaks line up in a deceptive manner — to eyes attached to overly imaginative brains.</p>



<h4>7. Nuclear fission</h4>



<p>In 1934, Italian physicist Enrico Fermi bombarded uranium (atomic number 92) and other elements with neutrons, the particle <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/neutron-atomic-brick-may-solve-mystery-cosmic-rays">discovered just two years earlier</a> by James Chadwick. Fermi found that among the products was an unidentifiable new element. He thought he had <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/italian-discovery-may-be-first-super-elements">created element 93</a>, heavier than uranium. He could not imagine any other explanation. In 1938 Fermi was awarded the <a href="https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/physics/1938/summary/">Nobel Prize in physics</a> for demonstrating “the existence of new radioactive elements produced by neutron irradiation.”</p>



<p>It turned out, however, that Fermi had unwittingly demonstrated nuclear fission. His bombardment products were actually lighter, previously known elements — fragments split from the heavy uranium nucleus. Of course, the scientists later <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/atomic-energy-released">credited with discovering fission</a>, Otto Hahn and Fritz Strassmann, didn’t understand their results either. Hahn’s former collaborator Lise Meitner was the one who explained what they’d done. Another woman, chemist Ida Noddack, <a href="http://acshist.scs.illinois.edu/bulletin_open_access/num3/num3%20p15-16.pdf">had imagined the possibility of fission</a> to explain Fermi’s results, but for some reason nobody listened to her.</p>



<h4>6. Detecting neutrinos</h4>



<p>In the 1920s, most physicists had convinced themselves that <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/century/atom-matter-neutron-nuclear-power-fusion">nature was built from just two basic particles</a>: positively charged protons and negatively charged electrons. Some had, however, imagined the possibility of a particle with no electric charge. One specific proposal for such a particle came in 1930 from Austrian physicist Wolfgang Pauli. He suggested that a no-charge particle could explain a suspicious loss of energy observed in beta-particle radioactivity. Pauli’s idea was worked out mathematically by Fermi, who named the neutral particle the neutrino. Fermi’s math was then examined by physicists Hans Bethe and Rudolf Peierls, who deduced that the neutrino would zip through matter so easily that there was no imaginable way of detecting its existence (short of building a tank of liquid hydrogen 6 million billion miles wide). “There is no practically possible way of observing the neutrino,” <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=5baAG1WqgYQC&amp;pg=PA221&amp;lpg=PA221&amp;dq=Bethe+Peierls+neutrino+%22no+practically+possible+way%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=9B4IiCxuwe&amp;sig=ACfU3U0eVlGt4G8dIuzdHJLwBFx8_UMA4g&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwiei_6Ts9r2AhVXhXIEHfHdDXwQ6AF6BAgkEAM#v=onepage&amp;q=Bethe%20Peierls%20neutrino%20%22no%20practically%20possible%20way%22&amp;f=false">Bethe and Peierls concluded</a>.</p>



<p>But they had failed to imagine the possibility of finding a source of huge numbers of high-energy neutrinos, so that a few could be captured even if almost all escaped. No such source was known until nuclear fission reactors were invented. In the 1950s, Frederick Reines and Clyde Cowan used reactors to definitely <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/neutrinos-confirmed">establish the neutrino’s existence</a>. <a href="https://www.nobelprize.org/uploads/2018/06/reines-lecture.pdf">Reines later said</a> he sought a way to detect the neutrino precisely because everybody had told him it wasn’t possible to detect the neutrino. &nbsp;</p>



<h4>5. Nuclear energy</h4>



<p>Ernest Rutherford, one of the 20th century’s greatest experimental physicists, was not exactly unimaginative. He imagined the existence of the neutron a dozen years before it was discovered, and he figured out that a weird experiment conducted by his assistants had revealed that atoms contained a dense central nucleus. It was clear that the atomic nucleus packed an enormous quantity of energy, but Rutherford could imagine no way to extract that energy for practical purposes. In 1933, at a meeting of the British Association for the Advancement of Science, he noted that although the nucleus contained a lot of energy, it would also require energy to release it. Anyone saying we can exploit atomic energy “is talking moonshine,” <a href="https://www.rarenewspapers.com/view/660212">Rutherford declared</a>. To be fair, Rutherford qualified the moonshine remark by saying “with our present knowledge,” so in a way he perhaps was anticipating the discovery of nuclear fission a few years later. (And <a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2011PhP....13..128J/abstract">some historians have suggested</a> that Rutherford did imagine the powerful release of nuclear energy, but thought it was a bad idea and wanted to discourage people from attempting it.)&nbsp;</p>

<h4>4. Age of the Earth</h4>



<p>Rutherford’s reputation for imagination was bolstered by his inference that radioactive matter deep underground could solve the mystery of the age of the Earth. In the mid-19th century, William Thomson (later known as Lord Kelvin) calculated the Earth’s age to be something a little more than 100 million years, and possibly much less. Geologists insisted that the Earth must be much older — perhaps billions of years — to account for the planet’s geological features.</p>



<p>Kelvin calculated his estimate assuming the Earth was born as a molten rocky mass that then cooled to its present temperature. But following the discovery of radioactivity at the end of the 19th century, Rutherford pointed out that it provided a new source of heat in the Earth’s interior. While giving a talk (in Kelvin’s presence), Rutherford suggested that Kelvin had basically prophesized a new source of planetary heat.</p>



<p>While Kelvin’s neglect of radioactivity is the standard story, <a href="https://www.americanscientist.org/article/kelvin-perry-and-the-age-of-the-earth">a more thorough analysis</a> shows that adding that heat to his math would not have changed his estimate very much. Rather, Kelvin’s mistake was assuming the interior to be rigid. John Perry (one of Kelvin’s former assistants) showed in 1895 that the flow of heat deep within the Earth’s interior would alter Kelvin’s calculations considerably — enough to allow the Earth to be billions of years old. It turned out that the Earth’s mantle is fluid on long time scales, which not only explains the age of the Earth, but also plate tectonics.</p>



<h4>3. Charge-parity violation</h4>



<p>Before the mid-1950s, nobody imagined that the laws of physics gave a hoot about handedness. The same laws should govern matter in action when viewed straight-on or in a mirror, just as the rules of baseball applied equally to Ted Williams and Willie Mays, not to mention Mickey Mantle. But in 1956 physicists Tsung-Dao Lee and Chen Ning Yang suggested that perfect right-left symmetry (or “parity”) might be violated by the weak nuclear force, and experiments <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/new-atomic-matter-laws">soon confirmed their suspicion</a>.</p>



<p>Restoring sanity to nature, many physicists thought, required antimatter. If you just switched left with right (mirror image), some subatomic processes exhibited a preferred handedness. But if you also replaced matter with antimatter (switching electric charge), left-right balance would be restored. In other words, reversing both charge (C) and parity (P) left nature’s behavior unchanged, a principle known as CP symmetry. CP symmetry had to be perfectly exact; otherwise nature’s laws would change if you went backward (instead of forward) in time, and nobody could imagine that.</p>



<p>In the early 1960s, James Cronin and Val Fitch tested CP symmetry’s perfection by studying subatomic particles called kaons and their antimatter counterparts. Kaons and antikaons both have zero charge but are not identical, because they are made from different quarks. Thanks to the quirky rules of quantum mechanics, kaons can turn into antikaons and vice versa. If CP symmetry is exact, each should turn into the other equally often. But Cronin and Fitch found that <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/invariance-theory-upset">antikaons turn into kaons more often</a> than the other way around. And that implied that nature’s laws allowed a preferred direction of time. “People didn’t want to believe it,” Cronin said in a 1999 interview. Most physicists do believe it today, but the implications of CP violation for the nature of time and other cosmic questions remain mysterious.</p>



<h4>2. Behaviorism versus the brain</h4>



<p>In the early 20th century, the dogma of behaviorism, initiated by John Watson and championed a little later by B.F. Skinner, ensnared psychologists in a paradigm that literally excised imagination from science. The brain — site of all imagination — is a “black box,” the behaviorists insisted. Rules of human psychology (mostly inferred from experiments with rats and pigeons) could be scientifically established only by observing behavior. It was scientifically meaningless to inquire into the inner workings of the brain that directed such behavior, as those workings were in principle inaccessible to human observation. In other words, activity inside the brain was deemed scientifically irrelevant because it could not be observed. “When what a person does [is] attributed to what is going on inside him,” <a href="https://www.bfskinner.org/2017/02/06/about-behaviorism-chapter-1-the-causes-of-behavior-quote-13/">Skinner proclaimed</a>, “investigation is brought to an end.”</p>



<p>Skinner’s behaviorist BS brainwashed a generation or two of followers into thinking the brain was beyond study. But fortunately for neuroscience, some physicists foresaw methods for observing neural activity in the brain without splitting the skull open, exhibiting imagination that the behaviorists lacked. In the 1970s <a href="http://beckerexhibits.wustl.edu/mig/bios/terpogossian.html">Michel Ter-Pogossian</a>, Michael Phelps and colleagues developed PET (positron emission tomography) scanning technology, which <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/views-living-brain">uses radioactive tracers to monitor brain activity</a>. PET scanning is now complemented by magnetic resonance imaging, based on ideas developed in the 1930s and 1940s by physicists <a href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/pdf/10.1021/bk-2020-1349.ch001">I.I. Rabi, Edward Purcell and Felix Bloch</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<h4>1. Gravitational waves</h4>



<p>Nowadays astrophysicists are all agog about gravitational waves, which can reveal all sorts of secrets about what goes on in the distant universe. All hail Einstein, whose theory of gravity — general relativity — explains the waves’ existence. But Einstein was not the first to propose the idea. In the 19th century, James Clerk Maxwell devised the math explaining electromagnetic waves, and speculated that gravity might similarly induce waves in a gravitational field. He couldn’t figure out how, though. Later other scientists, including Oliver Heaviside and Henri Poincaré, speculated about gravity waves. So the possibility of their existence certainly had been imagined.</p>



<p>But many physicists doubted that the waves existed, or if they did, could not imagine any way of proving it. Shortly before Einstein completed his general relativity theory, <a href="https://www.americanscientist.org/article/the-secret-history-of-gravitational-waves">German physicist Gustav Mie declared</a> that “the gravitational radiation emitted … by any oscillating mass particle is so extraordinarily weak that it is unthinkable ever to detect it by any means whatsoever.” Even Einstein had no idea how to detect gravitational waves, although he worked out the math describing them in a 1918 paper. In 1936 he decided that general relativity did not predict gravitational waves at all. But the paper rejecting them was simply wrong.</p>

<p>As it turned out, of course, gravitational waves are real and can be detected. At first they were verified indirectly, by the <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/astrophysical-path-gravity-waves">diminishing distance between mutually orbiting pulsars</a>. And more recently they were <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/gravity-waves-black-holes-verify-einsteins-prediction">directly detected by huge experiments relying on lasers</a>. Nobody had been able to imagine detecting gravitational waves a century ago because nobody had imagined the existence of pulsars or lasers.</p>



<p>All these failures show how prejudice can sometimes dull the imagination. But they also show how an imagination failure can inspire the quest for a new success. And that’s why science, so often detoured by dogma, still manages somehow, on long enough time scales, to provide technological wonders and cosmic insights beyond philosophers’ and poets’ wildest imagination.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://blog.arxiv.org/2022/03/31/heartfelt-farewell-to-martin-lessmeister-head-of-technology/">Heartfelt farewell to Martin Lessmeister, Head of Technology</a></h4>

              
                <p>After ten years of service to arXiv, Martin Lessmeister, Head of Technology, is moving on to a new opportunity. Brian Caruso, Senior arXiv Developer, will become the Interim Head of Technology.</p>
<p>“Having the opportunity to directly support arXiv and open access, with such a small, dedicated, and mission-driven team, has been an immensely gratifying experience for me,” Lessmeister said. “I will always be grateful for the strong goodwill and ‘rallying cries’ from the arXiv user community in reminding me that the work we’re doing behind the scenes matters, and is bigger than any single person. I know that arXiv has a bright future ahead of itself and I look forward to seeing how it grows.”</p>
<p>With his background in web development and distributed systems and a Masters of Engineering and Bachelor of Arts in Computer Science from Cornell University, Lessmeister has had an incredibly important and far-reaching impact on arXiv’s services. As arXiv submissions increased by 150 percent over the past decade, he brought clarity to complex code, policies, and workflows, and he successfully navigated through periods of technological and organizational change. He also helped set the high standard of collaboration at arXiv and upheld it with great integrity.</p>
<p>Among his many accomplishments, Lessmeister bridged arXiv’s legacy code and next generation systems, developed APIs and other systems that underpin arXiv’s moderation processes, and introduced MathJax, which renders mathematical equations in HTML. He shepherded community-developed tools into arXivLabs, spearheaded a multifaceted effort to improve arXiv’s metadata model, and worked with DataCite to register DOIs for the entire corpus. Most recently, Lessmeister led a team of just three developers charged with maintaining arXiv’s increasingly challenging legacy systems while simultaneously rewriting and migrating all systems to new architecture in the cloud.</p>
<p>“Martin’s dedication, commitment, deep technical expertise, and historical knowledge of the arXiv codebase will be greatly missed,” said Carol Hoover, Scholarly Communications and Licensing Librarian at Los Alamos National Laboratory Research Library, and Chair of arXiv’s Member Advisory Board. “He has been a pleasure to collaborate with and an essential part of arXiv’s ongoing success story.”</p>
<p>Lessmeister’s departure coincides with the resignation of Helen Wang, arXiv’s first product manager who was hired in 2021. With a Bachelor of Arts from Yale University and an MBA currently in progress, Wang’s experience in software spanned product management and business development in both nonprofit and corporate settings. In the product manager role, Wang aimed to align organizational objectives and product milestones through data and metrics, as well as support strategy and decision-making with analytics.</p>
<p>“I’ve been so inspired by the collective passion for arXiv’s mission among staff, students, and faculty,” Wang said. “I feel grateful to have been a part of many exciting accomplishments and changes, and look forward to seeing further progress on cloud migration efforts, community-driven features, and membership growth that will sustain arXiv through the next million submissions and beyond.”</p>
<p>“Helen’s commitment to the success of arXiv has been evident since her first day on the job,” said Hoover. “Her depth of experience and ability to learn quickly have been foundational to support arXiv&#8217;s mission as it transitions into the future.”</p>
<p>At a farewell picnic for Lessmeister and Wang, colleagues expressed heartfelt messages of support and thanks that can be summed up as “cheers and tears.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/skull-surgery-oldest-north-america-forehead-brain">North America’s oldest skull surgery dates to at least 3,000 years ago</a></h4>

              
                <p>A man with a hole in his forehead, who was interred in what’s now northwest Alabama between around 3,000 and 5,000 years ago, represents North America’s oldest known case of skull surgery.</p>



<p>Damage around the man’s oval skull opening indicates that someone scraped out that piece of bone, probably to reduce brain swelling caused by a violent attack or a serious fall, said bioarchaeologist Diana Simpson of the University of Nevada, Las Vegas. Either scenario could explain fractures and other injuries above the man’s left eye and to his left arm, leg and collarbone.</p>



<p>Bone regrowth on the edges of the skull opening indicates that the man lived for up to one year after surgery, Simpson estimated. She presented her <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/epdf/10.1002/ajpa.24514">analysis of the man’s remains</a> on March 28 at a virtual session of the annual meeting of the American Association of Biological Anthropologists.</p>





<p>Skull surgery <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/ancient-saharan-head-cases">occurred as early as 13,000 years ago</a> in North Africa (<em>SN: 8/17/11</em>). Until now, the oldest evidence of this practice in North America dated to no more than roughly 1,000 years ago.</p>



<p>In his prime, the new record holder likely served as a ritual practitioner or shaman. His grave included items like those found in shamans’ graves at nearby North American hunter-gatherer sites dating to between about 3,000 and 5,000 years ago. Ritual objects buried with him included sharpened bone pins and <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/oldest-tattoo-tools-tennessee-native-american">modified deer and turkey bones that may have been tattooing tools</a> (<em>SN: 5/25/21</em>).</p>



<p>Investigators excavated the man’s grave and 162 others at the Little Bear Creek Site, a seashell covered burial mound, in the 1940s. Simpson studied the man’s museum-held skeleton and grave items in 2018, shortly before the discoveries were returned to local Native American communities for reburial.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/bacteria-molecular-syringe-cells-microscopy">New images reveal details of two bacteria’s molecular syringes</a></h4>

              
                <p>Some bacteria carry tiny syringes filled with chemicals that may thin out competitors or incapacitate predators. Now, researchers have gotten up-close views of these syringes, technically known as contractile injection systems, from a type of cyanobacteria and a marine bacterium.</p>



<p>Figuring out how key parts of the molecular syringes work may help scientists devise their own nanomachines. Artificial injection machines could direct antibiotics against troublesome bacteria while leaving friendly microbes untouched.</p>



<p>Genes encoding pieces of the injection machinery are found in many bacterial species. But, “just by looking at the genes, it’s quite hard to predict how these contractile injection systems work,” says Gregor Weiss, a cellular structural biologist at ETH Zurich.</p>





<p>So Weiss and colleagues examined bacterial syringes using cryo-electron microscopy, in which cells are flash frozen to capture <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/scientists-spy-secret-inner-life-bacteria">cellular structures as they typically look in nature</a> (<em>SN: 6/22/17</em>).</p>



<p>Previously, researchers have found syringes anchored in some bacteria’s outer membranes, where the bacteria can shoot their payload into cells they bump into. Other species’ injectors squirt their contents into the environment.</p>



<p>But in a type of cyanobacteria called <em>Anabaena</em>, the syringes are in an unusual place, <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41564-021-01055-y">nestled in the membrane of the internal structure where the bacteria carry out photosynthesis</a>, Weiss and colleagues report in the March <em>Nature Microbiology</em>. Buried inside the cells, “it’s hard to imagine how [the syringes] could get out and interact with the target organism,” Weiss says.</p>

Weiss <em>et al</em>/<em>Nature Microbiology</em> 2022</span></figcaption></figure>



<p><em>Anabaena</em> may use its syringes against itself to trigger programmed cell death when the cyanobacteria come under stress. In the team’s experiments, ultraviolet light or high salt levels in water triggered some syringes to dump their payload. That led to the death of some <em>Anabaena</em> cells in the long chains that the cyanobacteria grow in, forming hollow “ghost cells.”</p>



<p>Ghost cells shed their outer wall and membrane, exposing unfired syringes in the inner membrane to the outside. The ghosts may act like Trojan horses, delivering their deadly payload to predators or competitors, the team hypothesizes. The researchers haven’t yet found which organisms are the probable targets of <em>Anabaena’</em>s syringes.</p>



<p>Inside a type of marine bacteria called <em>Algoriphagus machipongonensis</em>, the story is a bit different. Here, the syringes <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41564-022-01059-2">have a different architecture and float unmoored within the bacterial cell</a>, ETH Zurich’s Charles Ericson and colleagues report in the March <em>Nature Microbiology.</em> The injectors are also found in the liquid in which the bacteria are grown in the laboratory, but how they get out of the cell is a mystery. Perhaps they are released when the bacteria die or get eaten by a predator, Ericson says.</p>



<p>The team also found two proteins loaded inside the <em>Algoriphagus’ </em>syringes, but what those proteins do isn’t known. The researchers tried genetically engineering <em>E. coli</em> to produce one of the proteins, but it kills the bacteria, says study coauthor Jingwei Xu, also at ETH Zurich.</p>

<p>Comparing the structures of syringes from various species, the researchers identified certain structures within the machines that are similar, but slightly different from species to species. Learning how those modifications change the way the injectors work may allow researchers to load different cargoes into the tubes or target the syringes against specific bacteria or other organisms. “Now we have the general blueprint,” Ericson says, “can we re-engineer it?”</p>

                <p>Note: TCC Africa issued the following press release on behalf of all three organizations on Wednesday, March 30, 2022</p>



<p>NAIROBI &mdash; The Association for African Universities (AAU), the Public Library of Science (PLOS), and the Training Centre in Communication (TCC Africa) today announced that they will collaborate to increase awareness and provide training around Open Science practices and Open Access publishing in Africa.&nbsp;</p>



<p>&ldquo;We are eager to collaborate with PLOS and TCC Africa to improve knowledge about Open Science and increase levels of adoption and practice at member institutions,&rdquo; said Professor Oyewole, Secretary General of the Association of African Universities. &ldquo;This partnership will also enable us to identify challenges to Open Science adoption while simultaneously supporting effective implementation. This partnership is another proof of the AAU&rsquo;s commitment to build the capacity of its members so they infuse internationally acceptable research and data management practices into their operations.&rdquo;</p>



<p>&ldquo;We already work closely with PLOS, and we are excited about teaming with AAU,&rdquo; said Joy Owango, Executive Director, Training Centre in Communication. &ldquo;All three organizations will play key roles in the communication of, and education in, Open Science practices.&rdquo;</p>



<p>&ldquo;This partnership extends our work with TCC Africa and fits perfectly with our mission to work at a local level, within communities, while listening and learning, so that we can understand and reflect local needs and values with regards to Open Science policies and practices,&rdquo; said Roheena Anand, Executive Director of Global Publishing Development, PLOS. &ldquo;Our work with AAU and TCC Africa will not just benefit African researchers and institutions, but will also help inform activities on a global scale.&rdquo;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>The objectives of this collaboration will primarily be achieved through capacity-building regional workshops carried out across the continent. The launch of the initiative, on April 26, 2022, will be virtual, and is an invitation to the Presidents, Vice Chancellors, Rectors, Deputy Vice Chancellors,Directors of Research and Libraries of African Universities to inform them of the intent of this collaboration.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The initiative will be supported by the participation of representatives from UNESCO, who will talk about the global Open Science recommendation, and the International Science Council.&nbsp;</p>



<p>All three organizations are heavily invested in an Open future and want to work with stakeholders across the scholarly communication ecosystem of Africa to promote and increase uptake of Open Access and Open Science more broadly.&nbsp;</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/joro-spiders-invasive-huge-female-male-size-color">Invasive jorō spiders get huge and flashy — if they’re female</a></h4>

              
                <p>Some thumbnail-sized, brown male spiders in Georgia could be miffed if they paid the least attention to humans and our news obsessions.</p>



<p>Recent stories have made much of “giant” jorō spiders invading North America from eastern Asia, some large enough to span your palm. Lemon yellow bands cross their backs. Bright red bits can add drama, and a softer cheesecake yellow highlights the many joints on long black legs.</p>



<p>The showy giants, however, are just the females of <em>Trichonephila clavata</em>. Males hardly get mentioned except for what they’re not: colorful or big. &nbsp;A he-spider hulk at 8 millimeters barely reaches half the length of small females. Even the species nickname ignores the guys. The word <em>jorō,</em> borrowed from Japanese, translates to such unmasculine terms as “courtesan,” “lady-in-waiting” and even “entangling or binding bride.”</p>





<p>Mismatched sexes are nothing new for spiders. The group shows the most <a href="https://www.annualreviews.org/doi/abs/10.1146/annurev-ento-011019-025032">extreme size differences between</a> the sexes known among land animals, says evolutionary biologist Matjaž Kuntner of the Evolutionary Zoology Lab in Ljubljana, Slovenia. The most dramatic case Kuntner has heard of comes from <em>Arachnura logio</em> scorpion spiders in East Asia, with females 14.8 times the size of the males.</p>



<p>With such extreme size differences, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/whos-dying-sex">mating conflicts in animals can get violent</a>: females cannibalizing males and so on (<em>SN: 11/13/99</em>). As far as Kuntner knows, however, jorō spiders don’t engage in these “sexually conflicted” extremes. Males being <em>merely</em> half size or thereabouts might explain the relatively peaceful encounters.</p>



<p>When it comes to humans, these spiders don’t bother anybody who doesn’t bother them. But what a spectacle they make. “I’ve got dozens and dozens in my yard,” says ecologist Andy Davis at the University of Georgia in Athens. “One big web can be 3 or 4 feet in diameter.” Jorō spiders have <a href="https://peerj.com/articles/763/">lived in northeastern Georgia since at least 2014</a>.</p>

Howell (female) and B.J. Freeman (inset male), E.R. Hoebeke, W. Huffmaster and B.J. Freeman/<em>PeerJ</em> 2015</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>These new neighbors inspired Davis and undergraduate Benjamin Frick to see if the newcomers withstand chills better than an earlier invader, <em>Trichonephila clavipes, </em>their more tropical relative also known as the golden silk orb-weaver. (The jorō also can spin yellow-tinged silk.) The earlier arrival’s flashy females and drab males haven’t left the comfy Southeast they invaded at least 160 years ago.</p>



<p>Figuring out the jorō’s hardiness involves taking the spider’s pulse. But how do you do that with an arthropod with a hard exoskeleton? A spider’s heart isn’t a mammallike lump circulating blood through a closed system. The jorō sluices its bloodlike fluid through a long tube open at both ends. “Think of a garden hose,” says Davis. He has measured heart rates of monarch caterpillars, and he found a spot on a spider’s back where a keen-eyed observer can count throbs.</p>



<p>Female jorō spiders packed in ice to simulate chill stress kept their heart rates some 77 percent higher than the stay-put <em>T. clavipes</em>, tests showed. Checking jorō oxygen use showed females have about twice the metabolic rate. And about two minutes of freezing temperatures showed better female survival (74 percent versus 50 percent). Lab tests used only the conveniently big jorō females, though male ability to function in random cold snaps could matter too.</p>



<p>Plus jorō sightings in the Southeast so far suggest the newer arrival needs less time than its relative to make the next generation, an advantage for farther to the north. The adults don’t need to survive deep winter in any case. Mom and dad die off, in November in Georgia, and leave their hundreds of eggs packed in silk to weather the cold and storms.</p>



<p>Reports on the citizen-observer <a href="https://www.inaturalist.org/observations?place_id=1&amp;subview=map&amp;taxon_id=904334">iNaturalist</a> &nbsp;site suggest that in Georgia, jorō spiders <a href="https://resjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/phen.12385">already cover some 40,000 square kilometers</a>, Davis and Frick report February 17 in <em>Physiological Entomology. </em>Sightings now stretch into Tennessee and the Carolinas. But how far the big moms and tiny dads will go and when, we’ll just have to wait and see.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2022/03/30/embracing-discomfort-rather-than-avoiding-it-can-help-us-work-towards-our-personal-goals/">Embracing discomfort, rather than avoiding it, can help us work towards our personal goals</a></h4>

              
                <p><em>By</em> <a href="https://twitter.com/mattbwarren">Matthew Warren</a></p>



<p>In order to develop new skills or grow as a person, you often have to get out of your comfort zone. Say you want to become a better public speaker: you will have to get up and practice speaking in front of others, and that will likely feel awkward and uncomfortable at first.</p>



<p>This can create barriers to personal growth, because those feelings of discomfort that you experience will come well before you will notice any improvement in your skills. As a result, you might feel that the negative emotional experience is not worth it, and give up on your goal.</p>



<p>But what if we reframe our attitude towards discomfort, seeing it as a sign of progress and something to strive for rather than avoid? A <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/09567976211044685">new paper</a> in <em>Psychological Science </em>suggests that this way of thinking can motivate people to work towards their goals.</p>



<span id="more-45885"></span>



<p>In the first study, Kaitlin Woolley from Cornell University and Ayelet Fishbach from the University of Chicago recruited 557 adults enrolled in beginner-level improvisation workshops. Participants took part in an improv exercise called “Give Focus”. This involves one member of the group moving around the room however they wish while the others are frozen in place; at some point the free-moving improviser chooses to pass the “focus” on to another member of the group, who then takes over.</p>



<p>Before the exercise began, half of the participants were told that the goal was “to feel awkward and uncomfortable”, and that these feelings were a sign that the exercise was working. Control participants were simply given the normal instructions for the exercise, without any mention of discomfort. The researchers took video recordings of the improvisations, which were later rated for both persistence (how long participants took the spotlight before passing it on to another member of the group) and risk-taking (how much they pushed the boundaries or went out a limb during their improvisation).</p>



<p>The team found that participants who had been told to pursue feelings of awkwardness spent more time improvising and showed more risk-taking, which the authors interpret as showing that they were more motivated during the task. These participants also were more likely to believe that they had achieved their personal goals during the exercise.</p>



<p>Further online experiments suggested that seeking out feelings of discomfort can motivate people in a range of other situations too. In one study, participants took part in a writing exercise that they were told could help them work though an important emotional issue. Some were told that the goal of the exercise was to feel awkward and uncomfortable, and that these feelings were a sign that the task was working. After finishing the task, these participants were more likely to believe that the exercise had helped them to grow emotionally and develop coping skills, and were more motivated to repeat it in the future, compared to a control group.  </p>



<p>In other studies, participants were similarly encouraged to feel upset or uncomfortable while reading about Covid-19, gun violence, or the views of an opposing political party. These participants were more motivated to learn about these topics compared to control participants who did not seek out discomfort.</p>



<p>Overall, the results suggest that we should seek out the feelings of awkwardness or discomfort that are often associated with personal growth, and interpret them as signs of progress towards our goals. This can motivate us when faced with what we might otherwise simply see as negative emotional experiences.</p>



<p>It’s nice to see a paper that doesn’t just rely on online or lab-based studies, but includes a test of the intervention in the real world — in this case, in actual improvisation workshops. But it would be interesting to know whether embracing discomfort has long-lasting effects on motivation too, beyond a single point in time. Is someone actually more likely to persist with their goal of being a better public speaker if they embrace feelings of discomfort? Only longer-term studies will be able to tell.</p>

                <p>Julius Nziza still remembers the moment vividly. Just before dawn on a chilly January morning in 2019, he and his team gently extracted a tiny brown bat from a net purposely strung to catch the nocturnal fliers. A moment later, the researchers’ whoops and hollers pierced the heavy mist blanketing Rwanda’s Nyungwe National Park. The team had just laid eyes on a Hill’s horseshoe bat (<em>Rhinolophus hilli</em>), which scientists hadn’t seen for nearly four decades.</p>



<p>Nziza, a wildlife veterinarian at Gorilla Doctors in Musanze, Rwanda, and a self-described “bat champion,” had been looking for the critically endangered <em>R. hilli</em> since 2013. For several years, Nziza and Paul Webala from Maasai Mara University in Narok, Kenya, with the help of Nyungwe park rangers, surveyed the forest for spots where the bats might frequent. They didn’t find <em>R. hilli, </em>but it helped them narrow where to keep looking.</p>



<p>In 2019, the team decided to concentrate on roughly four square kilometers in a high-elevation region of the forest where <em>R. hilli </em>had last been spotted in 1981. Accompanied by an international team of researchers, Nziza and Webala set out for a 10-day expedition in search of the elusive bat. It wasn’t rainy season yet, but the weather was already starting to turn. “It was very, very, very cold,” Nziza recalls.</p>





<p>Every night, from sunset until close to midnight, the researchers stretched nets across trails, where bats are most likely to fly, and kept watch. Then, after a few hours of rest, they woke early to check the traps again. It was cold enough that the bats could die if stuck too long.</p>



<p>At 4 a.m. on the fourth day, the researchers caught a bat with the distinctive horseshoe-shaped nose of all horseshoe bat species. But it looked slightly different from others they had captured. This one had darker fur and a pointed tip on its nose.</p>



<p>Everyone began shouting: “This is it!”</p>

<p>The researchers felt “almost 99 percent sure” they had found the lost bat. “We had a couple beers in the evening,” Nziza says. “It was worth celebration.” To be 100 percent sure, though, the team needed to compare its specimen to past ones of <em>R. hilli</em>. Fortunately, there were two in museums in Europe.</p>



<p>That’s because this isn’t the first time that <em>R. hilli</em> was lost, then found, to science. Victor van Cakenberghe, a retired taxonomist at the University of Antwerp in Belgium, rediscovered<em> R. hilli </em>17 years after it was first seen in 1964. He says he still remembers finding the bat tangled in a mist net strung across a river. He kept the specimen and brought it back to a Belgian museum.</p>



<p>Nearly 40 years later, Nziza and colleagues compared the measurements of their bat,&nbsp;which was released into the wild, to the preserved bat. At long last, it can be confidently said that <a href="https://preprints.arphahub.com/article/83547/"><em>R. hilli </em>was rediscovered again</a>, researchers report March 11 in a preprint submitted to <em>Biodiversity Data Journal</em>.</p>



<p>And, for the first time ever, the scientists recorded <em>R. hilli</em>’s echolocation call. Now, the rangers can use <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/bats-people-spillover-transmission-coronavirus-covid-19">acoustic detectors</a> to keep an eye — or rather, an ear —&nbsp;on the bat (<em>SN: 10/23/20</em>). In nine months, they’ve already captured <em>R. hilli</em> calls from eight different locations in the same small area.</p>

<p>The team <a href="https://www.gbif.org/dataset/e9bf7d9e-8b31-4a02-8203-f7153b5d64c6">published its data to the open-access Global Biodiversity Information Facility</a> in hopes of speeding up conservation efforts for the bat. Africa is home to over 20 percent of the world’s bats, but with a longstanding research focus on bats in Europe and the Americas, little is known about African bat species.</p>



<p>“It&#8217;s a whole new thing,” Nziza says. “That&#8217;s why everybody&#8217;s excited.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2022/03/plos-launches-new-feature-to-promote-data-sharing-and-access/">PLOS launches new feature to promote data sharing and access</a></h4>

              
                <p><strong>Note:</strong> PLOS issued the following press release the week of March 28, 2022</p>



<p>SAN FRANCISCO &mdash; The <a href="https://plos.org/">Public Library of Science (PLOS)</a> today announced that it is testing a new experimental open science feature intended to promote data sharing and reuse across the PLOS journal portfolio. A subset of PLOS articles that link to shared research data in a repository will now display a prominent visual cue designed to help researchers find accessible data. Sharing research data that support published articles is considered best practice as it promotes data discovery and reuse, and aligns with the Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Reusable (FAIR) data principles.</p>



<p><a>&ldquo;We want to increase the adoption of open science and make the practice of open science more beneficial to researchers, who can encounter problems finding accessible data. To support these goals, and thanks to support from the </a><a href="https://wellcome.org/">Wellcome Trust</a>, we are experimenting with solutions designed to increase sharing and discovery of research data that also save researchers time,&rdquo; said Iain<strong> </strong>Hrynaszkiewicz,Director of Open Research Solutions, PLOS.</p>



<p>Today&rsquo;s launch is an &lsquo;Accessible Data&rsquo; feature deployed on articles that link to research data in one of several repositories. The feature will appear on more than 3,000 PLOS articles, beginning this week. It will also appear on newly published articles that qualify for the feature during the experiment, which is expected to run until the end of 2022. PLOS articles that link to datasets in <a href="https://datadryad.org/stash">Dryad</a>, <a href="https://figshare.com/">Figshare</a> or <a href="https://osf.io/">Open Science Framework</a> will display the feature initially. The feature will be extended to more repositories if the experiment is successful in increasing use of data associated with publications.</p>



<p>&ldquo;As an early adopter of Figshare, PLOS continues to innovate in open research publishing by introducing this new feature that will offer researchers who share and need to reuse FAIR data more benefits,&rdquo; said Mark Hahnel, CEO, Figshare.</p>



<p>&ldquo;Offering researchers incentives to share research data, such as badges or visual cues on their papers, has been shown to increase adoption of open science in other contexts. We welcome PLOS&rsquo; experiment with this feature and are looking forward to seeing the results,&rdquo; said David Mellor, Director of Policy, Center for Open Science.</p>



<p>Other publishers have experimented with prominent visual links to research data, and PLOS&rsquo; feature has similarities with the Center for Open Science&rsquo;s Badges. However, this experiment is intended to encourage more researchers to share data according to best practices as well as encourage wider access and use of data. Articles link directly to the data in the repository and offer a visual cue (or &ldquo;reward&rdquo;) on the published article. PLOS believes that making linked research data more visible on article pages will increase its use, helping readers spend less time looking for articles with accessible datasets.</p>



<p>In another experiment launched last October, <em>PLOS Pathogens</em> introduced an optional step in the manuscript submission process that allows seamless deposition of data to Dryad.</p>



<p>&ldquo;In addition to seeing Dryad users able to benefit from the Accessible Data feature experiment, we&rsquo;re also delighted to be part of <em>PLOS Pathogens</em> data deposition pilot, offering researchers in the journal&rsquo;s community tools and incentives to make their data findable and accessible,&rdquo; said Jennifer Gibson, Executive Director, Dryad.</p>

<p><a href="https://bookshop.org/a/21798/9781324006312">Vagina Obscura</a><br><em>Rachel E. Gross<br>W.W. Norton &amp; Co., $30</em></p>



<p>More than 2,000 years ago, Hippocrates, the Greek physician often considered the father of modern medicine, identified what came to be known as the clitoris, a “little pillar” of erectile tissue near the vagina’s entrance. Aristotle then noticed that the seemingly small structure was related to sexual pleasure.</p>



<p>Yet it wasn’t until 2005 that urologist Helen O’Connell uncovered that the “little pillar” was just the tip of the iceberg. The internal parts of the organ reach around the vagina and go into the pelvis, extending a network of nerves deeper than anatomists ever knew.</p>





<p>It took millennia to uncover the clitoris’s true extent because sexism has long stymied the study of female biology, science journalist Rachel E. Gross argues in her new book, <em>Vagina Obscura</em>. Esteemed men of science, from Charles Darwin to Sigmund Freud, viewed men as superior to women. To be male was to be the ideal standard. To be female was to be a stunted version of a human. The vagina, the ancient Greeks concluded, was merely a penis turned inside out, the ovaries simply interior testicles.</p>



<p>Because men mostly considered women’s bodies for their reproductive capabilities and interactions with penises, only recently have researchers begun to truly understand the full scope of female organs and tissues, Gross shows. That includes the basic biology of what “healthy” looks like in these parts of the body and their effects on the body as a whole.</p>



<p><em>Vagina Obscura</em> itself was born out of Gross’ frustration at not understanding her own body in the wake of a vaginal infection. After antibiotics and antifungal treatments failed due to a misdiagnosis, her gynecologist prescribed another treatment. As Gross paraphrases, the doctor told her to “shove rat poison up my vagina.” The infection, it turned out, was bacterial vaginosis, a hard-to-treat, sometimes itchy and painful condition caused by an overgrowth of bacteria that normally reside in the vagina. (The rat poison was boric acid, which is also an antiseptic. “It’s basically rat poison,” the doctor said. “You’re going to see that on the internet, so I might as well tell you now.”)</p>





<p>The book’s exploration of female anatomy begins from the outside in, first traversing the clitoris’s nerve-filled external nub to the vagina, ovaries and uterus. The last chapter focuses on gender affirmation surgery, detailing how physicians have transformed the field for transgender people. (Gross is up-front that words such as <em>women</em> and <em>men</em> create an artificial binary, with seemingly more objective terms like “male” and “female” not performing much better in encompassing humankind’s diversity, including intersex and transgender people.)</p>



<p>Throughout this tour, Gross doesn’t shy away from confronting the sexism and prejudices behind controversial ideas about female biology, such as vaginal orgasms (versus coming from the clitoris) and the existence of <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/pinpointing-g-spot-or-not">the G-spot</a> (<em>SN: 4/25/12</em>). Both “near-mystical” concepts stem from the male perspective that sexual pleasure should be straightforward for women, if only men could hit the right spot. Nor are the more appalling offenses swept under the rug, including racism, eugenics and female genital cutting. Footnotes throughout the book detail Gross’ efforts to navigate controversial views and stigmatizing or culturally charged terminology.</p>



<p>To lift readers’ spirits, she finds the right spots to deliver a dose of wry humor or a pun. She also shares stories of often forgotten researchers, such as lab technician <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/artificial-fertilization">Miriam Menkin</a>, who showed in 1944 that in vitro fertilization is possible (<em>SN: 8/12/44</em>). Yet Menkin’s role in describing the first instance of a human egg being fertilized in a lab dish has largely been erased from <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/mysteries-reproduction-parenthood-ivf-fertilization">IVF’s history</a> (<em>SN: 6/9/21</em>). There’s also plenty of opportunity to marvel at the power of the female body. Despite the long-held notion that a person is born with all the eggs they’ll ever have, for example, researchers are now discovering the ovary’s regenerative properties.</p>



<p>Studying female bodies more closely could ultimately improve quality of life. Chasing cells capable of producing more eggs might bring about discoveries that could restore the menstrual cycle in cancer patients rendered infertile by chemotherapy or make menopause less miserable. Patients with endometriosis, a painful disorder in which uterine tissue grows outside the uterus, are often dismissed and their symptoms downplayed. Some doctors even recommend getting pregnant to avoid the pain. But people shouldn’t have to suffer just because they aren’t pregnant. Researchers just haven’t asked the right questions yet about the uterus or endometriosis, Gross argues. </p>



<p><em>Vagina Obscura</em> reinforces that female bodies are more than “walking wombs” or “baby machines.” Understanding these organs and tissues is important for keeping the people who have them healthy. It will take a lot of vagina studies to overcome centuries of neglect, Gross writes. But the book provides a glimpse into what is possible when researchers (finally) pay attention.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/climate-change-wally-broecker-abrupt-ocean-conveyor-belt">Wally Broecker divined how the climate could suddenly shift</a></h4>

              
                <p>It was the mid-1980s, at a meeting in Switzerland, when Wally Broecker’s ears perked up. Scientist Hans Oeschger was describing an ice core drilled at a military radar station in southern Greenland. Layer by layer, the 2-kilometer-long core revealed what the climate there was like thousands of years ago. Climate shifts, inferred from the amounts of carbon dioxide and of a form of oxygen in the core, played out surprisingly quickly — within just a few decades. It seemed almost too fast to be true.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Broecker returned home, to Columbia University’s Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory, and began wondering what could cause such dramatic shifts. Some of Oeschger’s data turned out to be incorrect, but the seed they planted in Broecker’s mind flowered —&nbsp;and ultimately changed the way scientists think about past and future climate.</p>



<p>A geochemist who studied the oceans, Broecker proposed that the shutdown of a major ocean circulation pattern, which he named the great ocean conveyor, could cause the North Atlantic climate to change abruptly. In the past, he argued, melting ice sheets released huge pulses of water into the North Atlantic, turning the water fresher and halting circulation patterns that rely on salty water. The result: a sudden atmospheric cooling that plunged the region, including Greenland, into a big chill. (In the 2004 movie <em>The Day After Tomorrow</em>, an overly dramatized oceanic shutdown coats the Statue of Liberty in ice.)</p>

<p>It was a leap of insight unprecedented for the time, when most researchers had yet to accept that climate could shift abruptly, much less ponder what might cause such shifts.</p>



<p>Broecker not only explained the changes seen in the Greenland ice core, he also went on to found a new field. He prodded, cajoled and brought together other scientists to study the entire climate system and how it could shift on a dime. “He was a really big thinker,” says Dorothy Peteet, a paleoclimatologist at NASA’s Goddard Institute for Space Studies in New York City who worked with Broecker for decades. “It was just his genuine curiosity about how the world worked.”</p>



<p>Broecker was born in 1931 into a fundamentalist family who believed the Earth was 6,000 years old, so he was not an obvious candidate to become a pathbreaking geoscientist. Because of his dyslexia, he relied on conversations and visual aids to soak up information. Throughout his life, he did not use computers, a linchpin of modern science, yet became an expert in radiocarbon dating. And, contrary to the siloing common in the sciences, he worked expansively to understand the oceans, the atmosphere, the land, and thus the entire Earth system.</p>



<p>By the 1970s, scientists knew that humans were pouring excess carbon dioxide into the atmosphere, through burning fossil fuels and cutting down carbon-storing forests, and that <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/century/climate-change-carbon-dioxide-greenhouse-gas-emissions-global-warming">those changes were tinkering with Earth’s natural thermostat</a>. Scientists knew that climate had changed in the past; geologic evidence over billions of years revealed hot or dry, cold or wet periods. But many scientists focused on long-term climate changes, paced by shifts in the way Earth rotates on its axis and circles the sun — both of which change the amount of sunlight the planet receives.<a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.194.4270.1121"> A highly influential 1976 paper</a> referred to these orbital shifts as the “pacemaker of the ice ages.”</p>



<p>Ice cores from Antarctica <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/ice-cores-clues-past-climates">and Greenland changed the game</a>. In 1969, Willi Dansgaard of the University of Copenhagen and colleagues <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.166.3903.377">reported results</a> from a Greenland ice core covering the last 100,000 years. They found large, rapid fluctuations in oxygen-18 that suggested wild temperature swings. Climate could oscillate quickly, it seemed — but it took another Greenland ice core and more than a decade before Broecker had the idea that the shutdown of the great ocean conveyor system could be to blame.</p>

<p>Broecker proposed that such a shutdown was responsible for a known cold snap that started around 12,900 years ago. As the Earth began to emerge from its orbitally influenced ice age, water melted off the northern ice sheets and washed into the North Atlantic. Ocean circulation halted, plunging Europe into a sudden chill, he said. The period, which lasted just over a millennium, is known as the Younger Dryas after an Arctic flower that thrived during the cold snap. It was the last hurrah of the last ice age.</p>



<p>Evidence that an ocean conveyor shutdown could cause dramatic climate shifts soon piled up in Broecker’s favor. For instance, Peteet found evidence of rapid Younger Dryas cooling in bogs near New York City — thus establishing that the cooling was not just a European phenomenon but also extended to the other side of the Atlantic. Changes were real, widespread and fast.</p>



<p>By the late 1980s and early ’90s, there was enough evidence supporting abrupt climate change that two major projects — one European, one American — began to <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/tales-ice-time">drill a pair of fresh cores</a> into the Greenland ice sheet. Richard Alley, a geoscientist at Penn State, remembers working through the layers and documenting small climatic changes over thousands of years. “Then we hit the end of the Younger Dryas and it was like falling off a cliff,” he says. It was “a huge change after many small changes,” he says. “Breathtaking.”</p>





<p>The new Greenland cores cemented scientific recognition of <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/ice-core-shows-speedy-climate-change">abrupt climate change</a>. Though the shutdown of the ocean conveyor could not explain all abrupt climate changes that had ever occurred, it showed how a single physical mechanism could trigger major planet-wide disruptions. It also opened discussions about how rapidly climate might change in the future.</p>



<p>Broecker, who died in 2019, spent his last decades exploring abrupt shifts that are already happening. He worked, for example, with billionaire Gary Comer, who during a yacht trip in 2001 was shocked by the shrinking of Arctic sea ice, to brainstorm new directions for climate research and climate solutions.</p>



<p>Broecker knew more than almost anyone about what might be coming. He often described Earth’s climate system as an angry beast that humans are poking with sticks. And <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.189.4201.460">one of his most famous papers</a> was titled “Climatic change: Are we on the brink of a pronounced global warming?”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/ice-cream-crystals-grainy-nanocrystals-cellulose">Grainy ice cream is unpleasant. Plant-based nanocrystals might help</a></h4>

              
                <p>You can never have too much ice cream, but you can have too much ice in your ice cream. Adding plant-based nanocrystals to the frozen treat could help solve that problem, researchers reported March 20 at the <a href="https://www.acs.org/content/acs/en/meetings/acs-meetings.html">American Chemical Society spring meeting</a> in San Diego.</p>



<p>Ice cream contains tiny ice crystals that grow bigger when natural temperature fluctuations in the freezer cause them to melt and recrystallize. Stabilizers in ice cream — typically guar gum or locust bean gum — help inhibit crystal growth, but don’t completely stop it. And once ice crystals hit 50 micrometers in diameter, ice cream takes on an unpleasant, coarse, grainy texture.</p>



<p>Cellulose nanocrystals, or CNCs, which are derived from wood pulp, have properties similar to the gums, says Tao Wu, a food scientist at the University of Tennessee in Knoxville. They also share similarities with antifreeze proteins, produced by some animals to help them survive subzero temperatures. Antifreeze proteins work by binding to the surface of ice crystals, inhibiting growth more effectively than gums — but they are also extremely expensive. CNCs <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0268005X21004276">might work similarly</a> to antifreeze proteins but at a fraction of the cost, Wu and his colleagues thought.</p>



<p>An experiment with a sucrose solution — a simplified ice cream proxy — and CNCs showed that after 24 hours, the ice crystals <a href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/acs.biomac.1c01201">completely stopped growing</a>. A week later, the ice crystals remained at 25 micrometers, well beneath the threshold of ice crystal crunchiness. In a similar experiment with guar gum, ice crystals grew to 50 micrometers in just three days.</p>

<p>“That by itself suggests that nanocrystals are a lot more potent than the gums,” says Richard Hartel, a food engineer at the University of Wisconsin–Madison, who was not involved in the research. If CNCs do function the same way as antifreeze proteins, they’re a promising alternative to current stabilizers, he says. But that still needs to be proven.</p>



<p>Until that happens, you continue to have a good excuse to eat your ice cream quickly: You wouldn’t want large ice crystals to form, after all.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2022/03/accessible-datasets/">Spend less time looking for articles with accessible datasets</a></h4>

              
                <p>Author: Iain Hrynaszkiewicz, Director, Open Research Solutions, PLOS</p>



<p><em>We&rsquo;re testing a new experimental open science feature intended to promote data sharing and reuse across the PLOS journal portfolio. A subset of PLOS articles that link to shared research data in a repository will display a prominent visual cue designed to help researchers find accessible data, and encourage best practice in data sharing.</em></p>



<h2>Exploring incentives and increasing data accessibility</h2>



<p>As part of a <a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2021/09/wellcome-trust-awards-plos-a-grant-to-test-ways-to-increase-sharing-and-discovery-of-research-data/">project funded by the Wellcome Trust</a>, we are experimenting with solutions designed to increase sharing and discovery of research data. and the second of these solutions launches this week. Both solutions are intended to promote the use of data repositories for data sharing and the linking of data to publications. Sharing research data that support published articles is considered best practice as it promotes data discovery and reuse, and aligns with the <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/sdata201618">Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Reusable (FAIR) data principles</a>.</p>



<p>The first solution we introduced was <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plospathogens/article?id=10.1371/journal.ppat.1010021"><em>PLOS Pathogens</em>&rsquo; integration with the Dryad repository</a>, which launched as a pilot in October 2021, and aims to increase repository use by introducing a small (optional) step in the manuscript submission process that allows seamless deposition of data to Dryad.</p>



<p>This second, experimental, solution is an &lsquo;Accessible Data&rsquo; feature deployed on articles that link to research data in one of several repositories. The feature will appear on more than 3,000 PLOS articles, beginning this week. It will also appear on newly published articles that qualify for the feature during the course of the experiment, which is expected to run until the end of 2022.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image is-style-default"><figure class="alignleft size-full"><img loading="lazy" width="284" height="462" src="https://theplosblog.plos.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2022/03/image-12.png" alt="" class="wp-image-20187" srcset="https://theplosblog.plos.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2022/03/image-12.png 284w, https://theplosblog.plos.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2022/03/image-12-184x300.png 184w" sizes="(max-width: 284px) 100vw, 284px"></figure></div>



<p>We&rsquo;re <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.1002456">not</a> <a href="https://www.elsevier.com/authors/tools-and-resources/research-data/data-base-linking">the</a> <a href="http://www.ijdc.net/article/view/694">first</a> publisher to experiment with prominent visual links to research data, and some readers will see similarities between this feature and <a href="https://www.cos.io/initiatives/badges">Center for Open Science&rsquo;s Badges</a>. Since the introduction of our data availability policy in 2014, every published PLOS research article includes a Data Availability Statement (DAS) and a growing proportion of these include links to data repositories in the DAS. This solution leverages the outcomes of our long-standing data availability policy and aims to increase the visibility and reuse of those publications that share data in repositories, while encouraging more researchers to take this approach.</p>



<p>An important difference with this experiment is the questions we&rsquo;re asking. Previous projects have explored the role of badges in encouraging more researchers to share data according to best practises, with <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/labs/pmc/articles/PMC5803640/">some encouraging results</a>. But our solution is intended to promote both data sharing <em>and</em> access &ndash; by linking directly to the data in the repository, and offering a visual cue (or &ldquo;reward&rdquo;) on the published article. We hypothesise that making linked research data more visible on article pages will increase its use, helping readers spend less time looking for articles with accessible datasets.</p>



<p>Another difference in our approach is automation. Articles that qualify for the feature will display the feature automatically based on simple rules, without extra human intervention by authors or editors. This offers recognition to authors who have embedded good research data practice in their publishing workflow, without placing more burden on authors, editors or peer reviewers.</p>



<p>Our experimentation with these solutions is informed by <a href="https://datascience.codata.org/articles/10.5334/dsj-2021-031/">research involving PLOS authors</a> that suggest many researchers have challenges in accessing research data that they can reuse &mdash; which we assume could be addressed in part by wider use of repositories. The feature has been subject to several rounds of testing with researchers and design experts to optimise the visual design and language of the text.</p>



<h2>Scope of the experiment</h2>



<p>The Accessible Data feature is limited in its scope in this experimental phase*. The feature will appear on PLOS articles that:</p>



<ul><li>Have been published since 2016, and</li><li>Include a single link to data in a repository in their Data Availability Statement, and</li><li>The link directs to a unique record in Dryad, Figshare, or Open Science Framework (OSF)</li></ul>



<p>See an example&nbsp;<a href="https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pbio.3001107">here</a>.</p>



<p>We&rsquo;ve limited the scope for a few reasons. First, by keeping the scope no larger than necessary to test our hypotheses, we can experiment faster and at lower cost. Second, we need to be able to measure if we are successful in achieving the goal of increasing data access. Dryad, Figshare and OSF provide readily accessible usage data about deposited datasets, which will help us monitor any correlations between reader engagement with the links and usage of the datasets (We&rsquo;ve chosen usage/ engagement with the datasets as a more rapidly available proxy &ndash; and a prerequisite &ndash; for data reuse). Third, these repositories are relatively well used by PLOS authors, providing a sufficient cohort of papers with which to experiment.</p>



<p>There are numerous other repositories used by PLOS authors, which are equally as valuable to the researchers, communities, and institutions they support. If the solution is successful in achieving a measurable increase in data use, we will extend it in the future to handle more complexity &ndash;&nbsp; more data repositories, unique identifier types, and more complex Data Availability Statements. There are also other potential future directions to explore, such as the integration of data linking with data citations to increase credit for data sharing; with data discovery tools; and with <a href="http://www.scholix.org/">open infrastructure for sharing and reusing data-article link information</a>.</p>



<h2>Looking for the &lsquo;what&rsquo; and the &lsquo;why&rsquo;</h2>



<p>As well as monitoring what usage of the feature and datasets are observed, we&rsquo;re conducting research to help us understand why the solution is effective &ndash; or not. Readers of PLOS articles who use the feature will be invited to take part in a survey, and a subset invited to interviews. Authors submitting manuscripts after the launch of the feature will be surveyed to find out if the feature had any impact on how they shared data. This research will complement research we&rsquo;re also conducting with users of <a href="https://plos.org/open-science/open-data/#dryad">the <em>PLOS Pathogens</em> Dryad integration</a>.

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/orangutan-social-mingling-warning-calls-language-apes-humans">Social mingling shapes how orangutans issue warning calls</a></h4>

              
                <p>Human language, in its many current forms, may owe an evolutionary debt to our distant ape ancestors who sounded off in groups of scattered individuals.</p>



<p>Wild orangutans’ social worlds <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41559-022-01689-z">mold how they communicate vocally</a>, much as local communities shape the way people speak, researchers report March 21 in <em>Nature Ecology &amp; Evolution</em>. This finding suggests that social forces began engineering an expanding inventory of communication sounds among ancient ancestors of apes and humans, laying a foundation for the evolution of language, say evolutionary psychologist Adriano Lameira, of the University of Warwick in England, and his colleagues.</p>



<p>Lameira’s group recorded predator-warning calls known as “kiss-squeaks” — which typically involve drawing in breath through pursed lips — of 76 orangutans from six populations living on the islands of Borneo and Sumatra, where <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/borneo-hunting-emerges-key-threat-endangered-orangutans">they face survival threats</a> (<em>SN: 2/15/18</em>). The team tracked the animals and estimated their population densities from 2005 through 2010, with at least five consecutive months of observations and recordings in each population. Analyses of recordings then revealed how much individuals’ kiss-squeaks changed or remained the same over time.</p>





<p>Orangutans in high-density populations, which up the odds of frequent social encounters, concoct many variations of kiss-squeaks, the researchers report. Novel reworkings of kiss-squeaks usually get modified further by other orangutans or drop out of use in crowded settings, they say.</p>



<p>In spread-out populations that reduce social mingling, these apes produce relatively few kiss-squeak variants, Lameira’s group finds. But occasional kiss-squeak tweaks tend to catch on in their original form in dispersed groups, leading to larger call repertoires than in high-density populations.</p>



<p>Low-density orangutan groups — featuring small clusters of animals that occasionally cross paths — might mirror the social settings of human ancestors. Ancient apes and hominids also lived in dispersed groups that could have bred a growing number of ways to communicate vocally, the researchers suspect.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2022/03/28/when-the-school-day-starts-later-teens-get-better-sleep-and-feel-more-motivated/">When the school day starts later, teens get better sleep and feel more motivated</a></h4>

              
                <p><em><em>By guest blogger</em></em> <a href="https://twitter.com/E_Barratt">Emma L. Barratt</a></p>



<p>Getting out of bed is the first major hurdle of most teens’ weekdays. Often assumed to be the product of laziness or moodiness, this difficulty rising in the morning is actually due to adolescent sleep patterns. During teenage years, circadian rhythms are relatively delayed, causing teenagers to both go to sleep and wake up later in the day.</p>



<p>Even so, schools in the UK still demand that teens attend lessons from 9am or earlier, while high schoolers in Germany or the USA may start as early as 7:30am. This holds students to early rise times that are more suited to those in other age groups.</p>



<p>In an attempt to compensate for lost sleep during the week, teens often oversleep on weekends and reduce their sleep overall. As poor sleep routines are associated with cardiovascular issues, mood disorders, substance abuse and more, it’s easy to see why improving sleep in teens is an appealing target.</p>



<p>But what if school starting times worked with, rather than against, teenage sleep requirements? Research studies from years gone by indicate that such a change could be beneficial, but many lacked appropriate methods to measure potential effects of sleep interventions over longer periods of time.</p>



<p>This is precisely the gap that Anna Biller and colleagues in Germany endeavoured to fill with a <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-022-06209-4">recent study</a> in <em>Scientific Reports</em>.</p>



<span id="more-45864"></span>



<p>The team recruited students at a secondary school in Germany. This particular school has employed a &#8220;flexible system&#8221; since 2016, which allows students in grades 10 to 12 to postpone the start of their school day from 8AM to 8.50AM (or 10.15AM, on a day every two weeks when schedules allow it) as they please. Any morning study time lost to sleeping is regained by adding time after their last class of the day, or by filling gap periods already present in their schedule.</p>



<p>Data were collected in two waves, for six weeks immediately after the implementation of the flexible system and then again one year later. The team also took baseline measurements just before the system was introduced. 33 students participated in both waves, forming a longitudinal cohort.</p>



<p>In both waves, students completed a sleep diary noting when they fell asleep and woke up, their subjective sleep quality, and whether they had started school at 8AM or later. At the end of wave two, participating students also answered questions about their experiences and feelings surrounding the late start scheme.</p>



<p>Perhaps surprisingly, the uptake of late starts was quite low overall. By the end of the study, participants were only making use of a late start an average of just over one day per week. From student to student, uptake varied hugely — some would never use late starts, while others would use them every day.</p>



<p>When students did use later starts, however, they reported sleeping longer and better, getting closer to the optimal level of 8 hours of sleep. These benefits were near-universal, with 93% of students in the longitudinal cohort reporting longer sleep on late start days in both the first and second wave. On these days, participants also reported improved sleep quality, and were more likely to report waking naturally before their alarm.</p>



<p>A clear gender difference also emerged. In the first year, both boys and girls stuck to their usual bedtimes while using the flexible start. But a year later, boys were more likely to take the opportunity to postpone their sleep onset, resulting in sleep gains falling from 1.3 hours to just 30 minutes. The authors believe that this split in behaviour may have been a factor in previous research’s mixed findings.</p>



<p>However, the flexible system didn’t produce a significant improvement in students’ <em>overall</em> sleep across the entire week. The team believe that this is due to the low uptake of the late start scheme. Though on paper a later start might sound appealing, students listed many reasons that they preferred to start earlier, such as difficulty getting to school later.</p>



<p>Another paper from the same study also showed <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-022-06804-5">no improvement in grades for students who favoured waking later</a> — though the team believe that grades are arguably not an ideal proxy through which to see improvements. Despite this, the current paper did provide clear evidence of other kinds of benefits: not only did the students enjoy getting to school later on late-start days, they also felt more motivated and able to concentrate, and reported greater sense of wellbeing.</p>



<p>This study was conducted at the most academic type of German secondary school, equivalent to a grammar school, which limits the generalisability of the findings. It’s possible, perhaps even likely, that students from other backgrounds or countries will experience different costs and benefits when taking advantage of late starts.</p>



<p>As appealing as later school starts may sound, their practicality and effects on students within the UK system requires further investigation. Apologies to younger readers!</p>



<p>&#8211; <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-022-06209-4">Sleep improvements on days with later school starts persist after 1 year in a flexible start system</a></p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/virus-caterpillars-zombies-climb-death-genes-vision-sunlight">How a virus turns caterpillars into zombies doomed to climb to their deaths</a></h4>

              
                <p>Higher and higher still, the cotton bollworm moth caterpillar climbs, its tiny body ceaselessly scaling leaf after leaf. Reaching the top of a plant, it will die, facilitating the spread of the virus that steered the insect there.&nbsp;</p>



<p>One virus behind this deadly ascent <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/mec.16425">manipulates genes associated with caterpillars’ vision</a>. As a result, the insects are more attracted to sunlight than usual, researchers report online March 8 in <em>Molecular Ecology</em>.</p>



<p>The virus involved in this caterpillar takeover is a type of baculovirus. These viruses may have been evolving with their insect hosts for 200 million to 300 million years, says Xiaoxia Liu, an entomologist at China Agricultural University in Beijing. Baculoviruses can infect more than 800 insect species, mostly the caterpillars of moths and butterflies. Once infected, the hosts exhibit “tree-top disease,” compelled to climb before dying and leaving their elevated, infected cadavers for scavengers to feast upon.</p>





<p>The clever trick of these viruses has been known for more than a century, Liu says. But how they turn caterpillars into zombies doomed to ascend to their own deaths wasn’t understood.</p>



<p>Previous research suggested that infected caterpillars exhibit greater “phototaxis,” meaning they are more attracted to light than uninfected insects. Liu and her team confirmed this effect in the laboratory using cotton bollworm moth caterpillars (<em>Helicoverpa armigera</em>) infected with a baculovirus called HearNPV.</p>



<p>The researchers compared infected and uninfected caterpillars’ positions in glass tubes surrounding a climbing mesh under an LED light. Uninfected caterpillars would wander up and down the mesh, but would return to the bottom before pupating. That behavior makes sense because in the wild, this species develops into adults underground. But infected hosts would end up dead at the top of the mesh. The higher the source of light, the higher infected hosts climbed.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The team moved to the horizontal plane to confirm that the hosts were responding to light rather than gravity, placing caterpillars in a hexagonal box with one of the side panels illuminated. By the second day after infection, host caterpillars crawled to the light about four times as often as the uninfected.</p>



<p>When the researchers surgically removed infected caterpillars’ eyes and put the insects in the box, the blinded insects were attracted to the light a quarter as often as unaltered infected hosts. That suggested that the virus was using a caterpillar’s vision against itself.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The team then compared how active certain genes were in various caterpillar body parts in infected and uninfected larvae. Detected mostly in the eyes, two genes for opsins, the light-sensitive proteins that are fundamental for vision, were more active after an infection with the virus, and so was another gene associated with vision called <em>TRPL</em>. It encodes for a channel in cell membranes involved in the conversion of light into electrical signals.</p>



<p>When the team used the gene-editing tool CRISPR/Cas9 to shut off the opsin genes and <em>TRPL</em> in infected caterpillars, the number of hosts attracted to the light in the box was cut roughly in half. Their height at death on the mesh was also reduced.</p>



<p>Baculoviruses appear capable of commandeering the genetic architecture of caterpillar vision, exploiting an ancient importance of light for insects, Liu says.</p>



<p>Light can cue crucial biological processes in insects, from directing their developmental timing, to setting their migration routes.</p>



<p>These viruses were already known to be master manipulators in other ways, tweaking their hosts’ sense of smell, molting patterns and the programmed death of cells, says Lorena Passarelli, a virologist at Kansas State University in Manhattan, who was not involved with the study. The new research shows that the viruses manipulate “yet another physiological host process: visual perception.”</p>



<p>There’s still a lot to learn about this visual hijacking, Passarelli says. It’s unknown, for instance, which of the virus’s genes are responsible for turning caterpillars into sunlight-chasing zombies in the first place.</p>

                "The EU Directive on Copyright in the Digital Single Market contains two spectacularly bad ideas. One is the upload filter of Article 17, which will wreak havoc not just on creativity in the EU, but also on freedom of speech there, as algorithms block perfectly legal material. The other concerns the “snippet tax” of Article 15, more formally known as ancillary copyright..

Just as the impetus for the upload filter came from the music and film industries, so the lobbying for Article 15 came from newspaper publishers. The logic behind their demand, such as it was, seemed to be that Google was making money from ads on its pages that had some links to newspaper sites. That ignored two inconvenient facts. First, that Google’s dedicated news site, Google News, had precisely zero ads on its pages. And secondly, the pages on the main Google search engine that did have ads, had many other search hits alongside links to newspapers.

The advice given ranges from making a scarecrow (or&nbsp;<em>scarecockatoo</em>, I suppose), to painting wood white, to spraying the birds with the hose (!), and it is recommended to persist in one’s chosen strategies until the birds leave, noting that this can take more than a week.&nbsp;</p><p>Most curiously, the page carefully elides the important question of why cockatoos attack—it says simply “there are many theories why they do this.” Ask an Australian, though, and the answer will be quickly forthcoming: the cockatoos are acting out of spite.&nbsp;</p><p>Most often, the supposed slight that caused the spite is the taking away of bird feeders. It may well be a case of confirmation bias, or simply of populations of hungry birds correlating within site of former bird feeders, but the story is usually told the same. “I normally put out bird seed in my garden, and all sorts of birds come and eat it, including the big cockatoos. One day, I forgot to put out the seed, and the cockatoos were clearly angry, and took it out on my house—they chewed right through my deck railing, and tore the weather stripping of my back windows!”</p><p>This superimposes a very human impulse onto the observed behaviour of the cockatoos: it looks and feels like revenge.&nbsp;</p><p>The idea that cockatoos are capable of human-like spite is a common one in Australia, driven both by the house-destructive behaviours and by videos and news stories of sulphur-crested cockatoos tearing off and destroying (seemingly with glee) the anti-bird spikes affixed to buildings to keep them away. I once saw a video of an activist who campaigns for better care for pet parrots destroying a small birdcage in front of the cockatoo who had been inappropriately kept in it, as the cockatoo squawked and head-bobbed and fanned his crest in what could only be described as celebration of the act of destruction. As human observers, watching the behaviours of these big, bold, intelligent birds, who are unafraid of showing us their emotions, it is very hard not to project human emotion onto the cockatoos.&nbsp;</p><div><blockquote><p>&#8221; Spite is a very controversial matter when it comes to evolutionary biology and animal behaviour—and not everything that strikes us as spite at first look should really be given that name.&#8221;</p></blockquote></div><p>But we have to be careful! Spite is a very controversial matter when it comes to evolutionary biology and animal behaviour—and not everything that strikes us as spite at first look should really be given that name. Take for example the anti-bird spikes. For a cockatoo that lives in a city, building ledges, street signs, and lamp posts are part of the bird’s (not-quite natural, but adopted) habitat. The bird has no concept of the purpose of the anti-bird spikes, because it has no concept of what is being prevented: property damage, cleaning costs, and public sanitation are not front-of-mind concerns for large parrots. The cockatoo does not see the spikes as an uncomfortable deterrent deliberately installed to keep it away, but merely as an environmental annoyance to be removed—like an ill-placed twig in a tree where it is trying to roost. So, like the twig, it destructively removes the spikes to make its environment more comfortable. The observing humans only see this as spiteful because we know what the bird does not—that the spikes were precisely designed and installed to make life less comfortable for the cockatoo.&nbsp;</p><p>Even supposing the cockatoo knew why the spikes were there, it still would not be spite because it has a material benefit to the cockatoo. It makes adaptive sense for the cockatoo to remove the spikes because it creates more space so that the cockatoo can comfortably and safely roost. A bit like having a car towed that has been improperly parked in your driveway, there may be a gruesome little bit of satisfaction, but it also has straightforward material benefit—you can park your own car in its proper place.&nbsp;</p><p>Animal behaviours that deal damage to other animals in exchange for benefit to the actor make evolutionary sense. Nature may be red in tooth and claw, but from the point of view of natural selection, dealing damage to obtain benefit is an easy calculation. From crippling parasites to territorial jostling to sexual competition, gaining a benefit at the expense of another animal is, unfortunately, how the natural world, and evolution, must often work.&nbsp;</p><p>What twists up the minds of evolutionary biologists though is the question of true spite: dealing damage to someone else at no benefit to yourself—just to hurt them. The human impulse to revenge has driven a lot of bad decisions in our history but it doesn’t make much evolutionary sense. Any action an animal takes, particularly violent and destructive actions, have a cost. That cost can be the chance of injury, the risk of retaliation, or just the physical energy expended; whatever it is, a well-adapted behaviour should not involve wasting energy and cost where there is no possible benefit to the actor. The cockatoos tearing up weather stripping are more like true spite. If the popular interpretation is true, and the cockatoos are retaliating after the house’s owner has stopped feeding them, the house destruction is costly spite on behalf of the birds. Cockatoos cannot eat wood or weather stripping, and in taking the time to rip up the house, they are wasting time that could be spent foraging elsewhere and risking potentially harmful retaliation (remember that hose?). The effort undertaken to destroy the house is pure spite—harming another with no chance of benefit to the cockatoos.&nbsp;</p><div><blockquote><p>&#8221; Whilst we have to be careful about projecting our own emotions onto the behaviours of animals, that intelligence and social lifestyle is something we share with birds.&#8221;</p></blockquote></div><p>Even here, though, we have to be careful. Part of a cockatoo’s natural behaviour includes chomping through wood in search of grubs and other food sources. It is conceivable that, in finding the usual bird-seed tray empty, the birds have sought to conserve energy by seeking other food sources in the immediate vicinity before moving on—including by searching the deck’s balustrade for tasty wood-boring grubs. As with every animal behaviour, we have to carefully interrogate the total environmental context of any behaviour before we draw conclusions about what might be going through the animal’s mind.&nbsp;</p><p>Spite, or revenge, is a very human idea. Our high level of intelligence and our highly social nature have resulted in our own species being all too capable of visiting non-adaptive, costly, damaging spite on our fellow humans—often harming ourselves in the pursuit of vengeance upon others. It is one of the uglier consequences of our remarkable brains. Whilst we have to be careful about projecting our own emotions onto the behaviours of animals, that intelligence and social lifestyle is something we share with birds, and especially with big, smart birds like cockatoos. Spite remains a controversial question in evolutionary biology—but it’s not surprising that one place we see truly spiteful behaviours that might just be real is in a bird that has so much in common with ourselves.</p><Img align="left" border="0" height="1" width="1" style="border:0;float:left;margin:0;padding:0;width:1px!important;height:1px!important;" hspace="0" src="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/i/687668708/0/oupblogpsychology"><div style="clear:both;padding-top:0.2em;"><a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/2/687668708/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/fbshare20.png" style="border:0;margin:0;padding:0;"></a>&#160;<a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/28/687668708/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/fblike20.png" style="border:0;margin:0;padding:0;"></a>&#160;<a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/16/687668708/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/linkedin20.png" style="border:0;margin:0;padding:0;"></a>&#160;<a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/29/687668708/oupblogpsychology,https%3a%2f%2fblog.oup.com%2fwp-content%2fuploads%2f2022%2f03%2fParrot-OUPBlog2-480x185.jpg"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/pinterest20.png" style="border:0;margin:0;padding:0;"></a>&#160;<a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/1/687668708/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/reddit20.png" style="border:0;margin:0;padding:0;"></a>&#160;<a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/24/687668708/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/twitter20.png" style="border:0;margin:0;padding:0;"></a>&#160;<a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/19/687668708/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/email20.png" style="border:0;margin:0;padding:0;"></a>&#160;<a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/20/687668708/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/rss20.png" style="border:0;margin:0;padding:0;"></a><h3 style="clear:left;padding-top:10px">Related Stories</h3><ul><li><a rel="NOFOLLOW" href="https://blog.oup.com/2022/03/history-repeats-yellow-fever-and-covid-19/">History repeats&#x2014;yellow fever and COVID-19</a></li><li><a rel="NOFOLLOW" href="https://blog.oup.com/2022/03/behind-the-cover-visualizing-human-centered-ai/">Behind the cover: Human-Centered AI</a></li><li><a rel="NOFOLLOW" href="https://blog.oup.com/2022/03/five-books-to-celebrate-british-science-week/">Five books to celebrate British Science Week</a></li></ul>&#160;</div>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/vampire-bat-lost-genes-blood-mammal">Lost genes may help explain how vampire bats survive on blood alone</a></h4>

              
                <p>Surviving on blood alone is no picnic. But a handful of genetic tweaks may have helped vampire bats evolve to become the only mammal known to feed exclusively on the stuff.</p>



<p>These bats have developed a range of physiological and behavioral strategies to exist on a blood-only diet. The genetic picture behind this sanguivorous behavior, however, is still blurry. But <a href="http://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.abm6494">13 genes that the bats appear to have lost</a> over time could underpin some of the behavior, researchers report March 25 in <em>Science Advances</em>.</p>



<p>“Sometimes losing genes in evolutionary time frames can actually be adaptive or beneficial,” says Michael Hiller, a genomicist now at the Senckenberg Society for Nature Research in Frankfurt.</p>





<p>Hiller and his colleagues pieced together the genetic instruction book of the common vampire bat (<em>Desmodus rotundus</em>) and compared it with the genomes of 26 other bat species, including six from the same family as vampire bats. The team then searched for genes in <em>D. rotundus </em>that had either been lost entirely or inactivated through mutations.</p>



<p>Of the 13 missing genes, <a href="https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rspb.2014.1079">three had been previously reported in vampire bats</a>. These genes are associated with sweet and bitter taste receptors in other animals, meaning vampire bats probably have a diminished sense of taste — all the better for drinking blood. The other 10 lost genes are newly identified in the bats, and the researchers propose several ideas about how the absence of these genes could support a blood-rich diet.</p>



<p>Some of the genes help to raise levels of insulin in the body and convert ingested sugar into a form that can be stored. Given the low sugar content of blood, this processing and storage system may be less active in vampire bats and the genes probably aren’t that useful anymore. Another gene is linked in other mammals to gastric acid production, which helps break down solid food. That gene may have been lost as the vampire bat stomach evolved to mostly store and absorb fluid.</p>



<p>One of the other lost genes inhibits the uptake of iron in gastrointestinal cells. Blood is low in calories yet rich in iron. Vampire bats must drink up to 1.4 times their own weight during each feed, and, in doing so, ingest a potentially harmful amount of iron. Gastrointestinal cells are regularly shed in the vampire bat gut, so by losing that gene, the bats may be absorbing huge amounts of iron and quickly excreting it to avoid an overload — an idea supported by previous research.</p>



<p>One lost gene could even be linked to vampire bats’ remarkable cognitive abilities, the researchers suggest. Because the bats are susceptible to starvation, they share regurgitated blood and are <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/blog/wild-things/vampire-bats-share-blood-make-friends">more likely to do so with bats</a> that previously donated to themselves (<em>SN: 11/19/15</em>). Vampire bats also form <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/vampire-bat-friendships-endure-captivity-wild">long-term bonds</a> and even feed with their friends <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/vampire-bats-drink-blood-friends-strangers-social">in the wild</a> (<em>SN: 10/31/19; SN: 9/23/21</em>). In other animals, this gene is involved in breaking down a compound produced by nerve cells that is linked to learning and memory — traits thought to be necessary for the vampire bats’ social abilities.</p>



<p>“I think there are some compelling hypotheses there,” says David Liberles, an evolutionary genomicist at Temple University in Philadelphia who wasn’t involved in the study. It would be interesting to see if these genes were also lost in the other two species of vampire bats, he says, as they feed more on the blood of birds, while <em>D. rotundus</em> prefers to imbibe from mammals.</p>



<p>Whether the diet caused these changes, or vice versa, isn’t known. Either way, it was probably a gradual process over millions of years, Hiller says. “Maybe they started drinking more and more blood, and then you have time to better adapt to this very challenging diet.”</p>

<p>The sperm whale is an endangered species. A major reason is that the whale oil is heat-resistant and chemically and physically stable. This makes it useful for lubricating delicate machinery. The only substitute is expensive carnauba wax from the leaves of palm trees that grow only in Brazil … [but] wax from the seeds of the jojoba, an evergreen desert shrub, is nearly as good.</p>



<h4>Update</h4>



<p>After sperm whale oil was banned in the early 1970s, the United States sought to replenish its reserves with <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/blooming-desert-project">eco-friendly oil from jojoba seeds</a> (<em>SN: 5/17/75, p.&nbsp;335</em>). Jojoba oil’s <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/shrub-rivals-whale-producing-prized-oil">chemical structure</a> is nearly identical to that of sperm whale oil, and the shrub is native to some North American desert ecosystems, making the plant an appealing replacement. Today, jojoba shrubs are cultivated around the world on almost every continent. Jojoba oil is used in hundreds of products, including cosmetics, pharmaceuticals, adhesives and lubricants. Meanwhile, sperm whale populations <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/50-years-ago-us-commercial-whaling-was-coming-to-an-end">have started to recover</a> under international anti-whaling agreements (<em>SN: 2/27/21, p. 4</em>).</p>

                <p>For weeks, I have been watching coronavirus cases drop across the United States. At the same time, cases were heading skyward in many places in Europe, Asia and Oceania. Those surges may have peaked in some places and seem to be on a&nbsp;<a href="http://click.societyforscience-email.com/?qs=684b120f8225de48c862746a73d62a338bf35c2e664b06073e732262c4cbaba01739cf2d048f99fd16ee394d0431577e9efa5408a4e78978">downward trajectory again</a>, according to Our World in Data.<br><br>Much of the rise in cases has been attributed to the omicron variant’s more transmissible sibling BA.2 clawing its way to prominence. But many public health officials have pointed out that the&nbsp;surges coincide with relaxing of COVID-19 mitigation measures.&nbsp;<br><br>People around the world are shedding their masks and gathering in public. Immunity from vaccines and prior infections have helped limit deaths in wealthier countries, but the omicron siblings are very good at evading immune defenses, leading to breakthrough infections and reinfections. Even so, at the end of February, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention posted&nbsp;<a href="http://click.societyforscience-email.com/?qs=684b120f8225de48ae04c4dd00ce71f2e3239f8b18640d095075bdb264fdb01a43b3dc2c9b460e3aae0da487b1b4b30f0926119effa4a94f">new guidelines for masking</a>, more than doubling the number of cases needed per 100,000 people before officials recommended a return to the face coverings (<em>SN: 3/3/22</em>).<br><br>Not everyone has ditched their masks. I have observed some regional trends. The majority of people I see at my grocery store and other places in my community in Maryland are still wearing masks. But on road trips to the Midwest and back, even during the height of the omicron surge, most of the faces I saw in public were bare. Meanwhile, I was wearing my N95 mask even when I was the only person doing so. I reasoned that I was protecting myself from infection as best I could. I was also protecting my loved ones and other people around me from me should I have unwittingly contracted the virus.<br><br>But I will tell you a secret. I don’t really like wearing masks. They can be hot and uncomfortable. They leave lines on my face. And sometimes masks make it hard to breathe. At the same time, I know that wearing a good quality, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/double-mask-fit-reduce-coronavirus-exposure-covid-19-pandemic">well-fitting mask</a> greatly reduces the chance of testing positive for the coronavirus (<em>SN: 2/12/21</em>).

Another 28 percent said they mask in indoor crowds, and 23 percent said they mask only where it’s mandatory. Only about 12 percent have ditched masks entirely.<br><br>Some poll respondents left comments clarifying their answers, but most people’s reasons for masking aren’t clear. Maybe they live in the parts of the country or world where transmission levels are high and hospitals are at risk of being overrun. Maybe they are parents of children too young for vaccination. Perhaps they or other loved ones are unvaccinated or have weakened immune systems that put them at risk for severe disease. Maybe, like me, they just don’t want to get sick — with anything.<br><br>Before the pandemic, I caught several colds a year and had to deal with seasonal allergies.

Right now, I just feel safer wearing a mask when I’m indoors in public places.<br><br>I’ve been thinking a lot about what would convince me that it was safe to go maskless.

That metric is mostly concerned with keeping hospitals and other health care systems from becoming overwhelmed. By that measure, most of the country has the green light to go maskless. I’m probably more cautious than the average person, but the levels of transmission in that metric that would trigger mask wearing — 200 or more cases per 100,000 population — seem high to me, particularly since CDC’s prior recommendations urged masking at a quarter of that level.<br><br>The metric is designed for communities, not individuals. So what numbers should I, as an individual, go by? There’s always the&nbsp;<a href="http://click.societyforscience-email.com/?qs=684b120f8225de48d1f00c5ec4cc1528e12ea7129feb69578ea8bb2ee7d04be016298d895ab8ac899918609bc2224d1d326ea41f7cabe154">CDC’s COVID-19 Integrated County View</a>&nbsp;that tracks case rates and test positivity rates — the percentage of tests that have a positive result. Cases in my county have been ticking up in the last few days, with 391 people having gotten COVID-19 in the last week — that’s about 37 out of every 100,000 people. That seems like relatively low odds of coming into contact with a contagious person. But those are only the cases we know about officially. There may be many more cases that were never reported as people take rapid antigen tests at home or decide not to test. There’s no way to know exactly how much COVID-19 is out there.<br><br>And the proportion of&nbsp;<a href="http://click.societyforscience-email.com/?qs=684b120f8225de48686dc752320ec3321a11c9bac98b41cfe03e5a500c742a3d27666ff0c787c96a98cb257106d3efc19d39d3d4b2799af5">cases caused by BA.2 is on the rise</a>, with the more infectious omicron variant accounting for about 35 percent of cases nationwide in the week ending March 19. In the mid-Atlantic states where I live, about 30 percent of cases are now caused by BA.2. But in some parts of the Northeast, that variant now causes more than half of cases. The increase is unsettling but doesn’t necessarily mean the United States will experience another wave of infections as Europe has. Or maybe we will. That uncertainty makes me uncomfortable removing my mask indoors in public right now.<br><br>Maybe in a few weeks, if there’s no new surge in infections, I’ll feel comfortable walking around in public with my nose and mouth exposed. Or maybe I’ll wait until the number of cases in my county is in single digits. I’m pretty sure there will come a day when I won’t feel the need to filter every breath, but for me, it’s not that time yet. And I truthfully can’t tell you what my magic number will be.<br><br>Here’s what I do know: Even if I do decide to have an unmasked summer, I will be strapping my mask back on if COVID-19 cases begin to rise again.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/boa-constrictor-snake-squeeze-prey-without-suffocating">Here’s how boa constrictors squeeze their dinner without suffocating themselves</a></h4>

              
                <p>The boa constrictor’s choke hold is an iconic animal attack. By coiling around its prey, a snake can <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/boa-suffocation-merely-myth">squeeze the life out of a victim</a> in mere minutes before gulping it down whole (<em>SN: 8/9/15</em>). But it’s been unclear just how <em>Boa constrictor</em> squeezes so hard — or swallows something as big as a monkey — without suffocating itself.</p>



<p>Now, experiments show that when one part of a boa constrictor’s rib cage is compressed — preventing the part of its lungs enclosed there from drawing in air — <a href="https://journals.biologists.com/jeb/article-lookup/doi/10.1242/jeb.243119">the snake can move another section of its rib cage</a> to inflate its lungs there. Boas and other snakes probably couldn’t have started throttling and swallowing large prey without this ability, researchers report March 24 in the <em>Journal of Experimental Biology</em>.</p>



<p>Biologist John Capano of Brown University in Providence, R.I., and colleagues implanted metal markers on the ribs of three boa constrictors, about one-third and halfway down the animals’ bodies. Tracking those markers in X-ray videos of the animals let the researchers map rib motions over different parts of the snakes’ lungs.</p>





<p>In these videos, the team wrapped a blood pressure cuff around different parts of the animals’ bodies. Then, the scientists increased the cuff’s pressure until the rib cage couldn’t move in that area — mimicking the effect of a snake using that part of its body to grip or gulp down prey.</p>



<p>When gripped by a cuff about one-third of the way down their body, snakes breathed by moving some ribs closer to their tails. When wrapped in a cuff about halfway down their body, snakes breathed by moving some ribs closer to their heads. “They can basically just breathe wherever they want,” Capano says. That makes him wonder whether snakes also adjust their breathing during other activities that compress their bodies, such as slithering.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/forest-trees-reduce-global-warming-climate-cooling-carbon">Forests help reduce global warming in more ways than one</a></h4>

              
                <p>When it comes to cooling the planet, forests have more than one trick up their trees. &nbsp;</p>



<p>Tropical forests help cool the average global temperature by more than 1 degree Celsius, a new study finds. The effect stems largely from forests’ capacity to <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/climate-change-natural-carbon-stores-new-map">capture and store atmospheric carbon</a> (<em>SN: 11/18/21</em>). But around <a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/ffgc.2022.756115/full">one-third of that tropical cooling effect</a> comes from several other processes, such as the release of water vapor and aerosols, researchers report March 24 in <em>Frontiers in Forests and Global Change.</em></p>



<p>“We tend to focus on carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases, but forests are not just carbon sponges,” says Deborah Lawrence, an environmental scientist at the University of Virginia in Charlottesville. “It&#8217;s time to think about what else forests are doing for us besides just absorbing carbon dioxide.”</p>





<p>Researchers already knew that forests influence their local climates through various physical and chemical processes. Trees release water vapor through pores in their leaves — a process called evapotranspiration — and, like human sweating, this cools the trees and their surroundings. Also, uneven forest canopies can have a cooling effect, as they provide an undulating surface that can bump hot, overpassing fronts of air upward and away. What’s more, trees generate aerosols that can lower temperatures by reflecting sunlight and seeding clouds.</p>



<p>But on a global scale, it wasn’t clear how these other cooling benefits compared with the cooling provided by forests’ capturing of carbon dioxide, Lawrence says.</p>





<p>So she and her colleagues analyzed how the complete deforestation of different regions would impact global temperatures, using data gathered from other studies. For instance, the researchers used forest biomass data to determine how much the release of carbon stored by those forests would warm the global temperature. They then compared those results with other studies’ estimates of how much the loss of other aspects of forests — such as evapotranspiration, uneven canopies and aerosol production — affected regional and global temperatures.</p>



<p>The researchers found that in forests at latitudes from around 50° S of the equator to 50° N, the primary way that forests influenced the global average temperature was through carbon sequestration. But those other cooling factors still played large roles.</p>



<p>Forests located from 30° N to 30° S provided alternative benefits that cool the planet by over 0.3 degrees C, about half as much cooling as carbon sequestration provided. And the bulk of that cooling, around 0.2 degrees C, came from forests in the core of the tropics (within 10° of the equator). Canopy topography generally provided the greatest cooling, followed by evapotranspiration and then aerosols.</p>



<p>Forests in the far north, however, appear to have a net warming effect, the team reports. Clearing the boreal forests — which stretch across Canada, Alaska, Russia and Scandinavia — would expose more snow cover during the winter. This would decrease ground level temperatures because snow reflects much of the incoming sunlight back into the sky. Still, the researchers found that altogether, the world’s forests cool the global average temperature about 0.5 degrees C.</p>



<p>The findings suggest that global and regional climate action efforts should refrain from focusing solely on carbon emissions, Lawrence says. “There&#8217;s this whole service that tropical forests are providing that simply are not visible to us or to policy makers.”</p>



<p>The research shows that clearing tropical forests robs us of many climate-cooling benefits, says Gabriel de Oliveira, a geographer from the University of South Alabama in Mobile. But deforestation isn’t the only way that humans impair forests’ cooling ability, he says. Many forests are <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/fire-amazon-rainforest-threatened-species-deforestation-biodiversity">damaged by fires</a> or selective logging, and are less able to help with cooling (<em>SN: 9/1/21</em>). It would be useful to consider how forest degradation, in addition to deforestation, impacts regional and global climate temperatures, de Oliveira says, to assess the impact of restoring and <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/planting-trees-protect-forests-climate-change">protecting forests</a> (<em>SN: 7/13/21</em>). “It&#8217;s cool to see beyond carbon dioxide, but it&#8217;s also very important to see beyond deforestation.”</p>
