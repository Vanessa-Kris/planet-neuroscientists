<p>In 2005, the U.S. Office of Research Integrity found an obesity researcher had engaged in scientific misconduct. More specifically, the ORI report revealed that Eric Poehlman, then based at the University of Vermont, had “falsified and fabricated” data in 10 papers. The 2005 report asked that the journals issue retractions or corrections to the papers. […]</p>

<img alt="" class="attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image" height="110" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2017/06/Fotolia-Enfant-pict-rider-140x110.jpg" style="display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;" width="140" /><p><strong>Children and the Sustainable Development Goals</strong></p>
<p>Children are central to the <a href="https://data.unicef.org/children-sustainable-development-goals/">2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development</a>. The 2030 agenda consists of 17 global goals with 169 targets between them which is measured by 230 specific indicators. 50 of these indicators are directly related to children. In 2015, child mortality for those aged under 5 was 5.9 million, which is almost 16,000 a day. It has been found that 83% of these deaths were due to infectious, neonatal, and nutritional conditions. China has seen a decline in under-5 mortality rate in the past 3 decades and it is one of the few countries to have achieved <a href="http://www.un.org/millenniumgoals/">Millennium Development Goals</a> (MDG) 4 (<a href="http://www.un.org/millenniumgoals/childhealth.shtml">reduce child mortality</a>) and 5 (<a href="http://www.un.org/millenniumgoals/maternal.shtml">improve maternal health</a>). Certain provinces in China have also been reported to have achieved this decrease in under-5 mortality rates <a href="http://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(16)00093-3/fulltext">twice as fast</a> as the MDG 4 target rate. It has been <a href="http://www.wpro.who.int/china/mediacentre/factsheets/mch/en/">reported</a> that Chinese children’s health status has improved remarkably and the rate of infant mortality and under-five mortality continue to decline.</p>
<figure class="wp-caption alignright" id="attachment_9180" style="width: 310px;"><img alt="" class="size-medium wp-image-9180" height="225" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2017/06/Image-by-Flickr-user-Micah-Sittig-CC-BY-2.0-300x225.jpg" width="300" /><div class="attachment-image--caption">Image by Flickr user Micah Sittig (CC BY 2.0)</div><div class="attachment-image--source"></div></figure>
<p>However, large disparities have also been found across the region. Although some provinces rivals the best results in the world with relation to under-5 mortality, the reality is very different in other provinces. Preterm birth, low birth weight, birth asphyxia, childhood pneumonia, and diarrhoea are amongst the major threats to infants in <a href="http://www.wpro.who.int/china/mediacentre/factsheets/mch/en/">some areas</a> of China. Efforts are therefore needed to address this <a href="http://thelancet.com/journals/langlo/article/PIIS2214-109X(16)30360-6/fulltext">disparity</a> and to close such gaps in subnational units seen within China.</p>
<p><strong>Nutrition</strong></p>
<p>A healthy diet and adequate nutrition is necessary to ensure optimum growth and development of children. About one third of child deaths worldwide are linked to malnutrition. This is a major health problem seen in China as well. <a href="http://www.who.int/bulletin/volumes/94/10/15-167031/en/">Climate change</a> also poses a new challenge in the control of undernutrition in this region, a matter which is already a concern particularly in poor rural areas.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.unicef.org/nutrition/index_66188.html">Chronic nutritional deficiency</a> during the first 1,000 days of a child’s life can result in stunting where the damage caused to the child’s development is irreversible. It is estimated that in China, <a href="https://www.unicef.org/eapro/media_20532.html">12.7 million</a> children are stunted, which is equivalent to the population size of Tokyo. A <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?cmd=Retrieve&amp;db=PubMed&amp;list_uids=27109127&amp;dopt=Abstract">national survey</a> carried out in China in 2013 showed that 8.1%, 2.4% and 1.9% of children under 5 years of age were stunted, underweight, and wasted, respectively. Results from a community based cross-sectional survey carried out by <a href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/cch.12148/full">Jiang and colleagues</a> in 84 villages in mid-western provinces of China in 2010 showed that malnutrition is a major public health problem among children and the prevalence of stunting and severe stunting was 27.0% and 13.2%, respectively. Location has been found to have a large impact on nutritional status in China. The risk of underweight and stunting is 3-4 times higher for children in rural areas than for those in cities.</p>
<p>Over the years improvements in these figures emerging from China can be seen. The level of undernourishment in the country was <a href="http://www.wfp.org/stories/10-facts-about-nutrition-china">reduced</a> from 23.9% in 1990 – 1992 to 9.3% in 2014 – 2016. Mortality in children under the age of 5 due to malnutrition also <a href="http://www.wfp.org/stories/10-facts-about-nutrition-china">dropped</a> from 22% to 13% between 2000 and 2010. Although the data illustrates that progress has been made resulting in a decline in stunting, underweight and wasting amongst children, the <a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0895398816300320">prevalence of undernutrition</a> remains high for children under 5 in rural areas.</p>

<p>China is the world’s largest greenhouse-gas emitter. It has been reported that the peak in China’s emissions of such gases could come by <a href="http://www.who.int/bulletin/volumes/94/10/15-167031/en/">2025</a>, if not sooner. At the United Nations climate summit which took place in 2015, China committed to halting the growth in its greenhouse gas emissions by 2030 where the new plans call for a reduction of <a href="https://www.nature.com/news/china-s-carbon-emissions-could-peak-sooner-than-forecast-1.19597">18% in carbon dioxide</a> emission and a <a href="http://www.who.int/bulletin/volumes/94/10/15-167031/en/">15% decrease in energy consumption</a>. Children are particularly vulnerable to the effects of air pollution. China has seen an increase of childhood asthma and there are <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20801627">studies</a> emerging which demonstrate a <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4311080/">positive correlation</a> between high levels of outdoor pollution with children’s respiratory symptoms.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>It is evident that the world cannot reach a number of the SDG <a href="https://data.unicef.org/children-sustainable-development-goals/">targets</a> in the 2030 agenda unless the specific needs of children are monitored and addressed. Although improvements and progress have been seen in certain circumstances, there is still more that needs to be done to ensure that children are provided with the necessary to live healthy lives and achieve their full potential. More needs to be done to ensure that no child is left behind.</p>

<p>Being able to measure time, whether directly or indirectly, is a significant
advantage for an organism. It permits it to predict regular events, and prepare
for them on time. Thus, clocks are ubiquitous in biology. In the presented paper,
we consider the most minimal abstract pure clocks and investigate their
characteristics with respect to their ability to measure time. Amongst others
we find fundamentally diametral clock characteristics, such as oscillatory
behaviour for local time measurement or decay-based clocks measuring time
periods in scales global to the problem. We also include cascades of
independent clocks ("clock bags") and composite clocks with controlled
dependency; the latter show various regimes of markedly different dynamics.</p>

<p>
 Constitutive heterochromatin is an important component of eukaryotic genomes that has essential roles in nuclear architecture, DNA repair and genome stability, and silencing of transposon and gene expression. Heterochromatin is highly enriched for repetitive sequences, and is defined epigenetically by methylation of histone H3 at lysine 9 and recruitment of its binding partner heterochromatin protein 1 (HP1). A prevalent view of heterochromatic silencing is that these and associated factors lead to chromatin compaction, resulting in steric exclusion of regulatory proteins such as RNA polymerase from the underlying DNA. However, compaction alone does not account for the formation of distinct, multi-chromosomal, membrane-less heterochromatin domains within the nucleus, fast diffusion of proteins inside the domain, and other dynamic features of heterochromatin. Here we present data that support an alternative hypothesis: that the formation of heterochromatin domains is mediated by phase separation, a phenomenon that gives rise to diverse non-membrane-bound nuclear, cytoplasmic and extracellular compartments. We show that Drosophila HP1a protein undergoes liquid–liquid demixing in vitro, and nucleates into foci that display liquid properties during the first stages of heterochromatin domain formation in early Drosophila embryos. Furthermore, in both Drosophila and mammalian cells, heterochromatin domains exhibit dynamics that are characteristic of liquid phase-separation, including sensitivity to the disruption of weak hydrophobic interactions, and reduced diffusion, increased coordinated movement and inert probe exclusion at the domain boundary. We conclude that heterochromatic domains form via phase separation, and mature into a structure that includes liquid and stable compartments. We propose that emergent biophysical properties associated with phase-separated systems are critical to understanding the unusual behaviours of heterochromatin, and how chromatin domains in general regulate essential nuclear functions.

<p>
 T cell receptor (TCR) sequences are very diverse, with many more possible sequence combinations than T cells in any one individual. Here we define the minimal requirements for TCR antigen specificity, through an analysis of TCR sequences using a panel of peptide and major histocompatibility complex (pMHC)-tetramer-sorted cells and structural data. From this analysis we developed an algorithm that we term GLIPH (grouping of lymphocyte interactions by paratope hotspots) to cluster TCRs with a high probability of sharing specificity owing to both conserved motifs and global similarity of complementarity-determining region 3 (CDR3) sequences. We show that GLIPH can reliably group TCRs of common specificity from different donors, and that conserved CDR3 motifs help to define the TCR clusters that are often contact points with the antigenic peptides. As an independent validation, we analysed 5,711 TCRβ chain sequences from reactive CD4 T cells from 22 individuals with latent Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection. We found 141 TCR specificity groups, including 16 distinct groups containing TCRs from multiple individuals. These TCR groups typically shared HLA alleles, allowing prediction of the likely HLA restriction, and a large number of M. tuberculosis T cell epitopes enabled us to identify pMHC ligands for all five of the groups tested. Mutagenesis and de novo TCR design confirmed that the GLIPH-identified motifs were critical and sufficient for shared-antigen recognition. Thus the GLIPH algorithm can analyse large numbers of TCR sequences and define TCR specificity groups shared by TCRs and individuals, which should greatly accelerate the analysis of T cell responses and expedite the identification of specific ligands.

                <h4><a href="http://feeds.nature.com/~r/NatureBiologicalSciencesResearch/~3/UsYgqhenEkY/nature22975">Host and viral traits predict zoonotic spillover from mammals</a></h4>

<p>
 The majority of human emerging infectious diseases are zoonotic, with viruses that originate in wild mammals of particular concern (for example, HIV, Ebola and SARS). Understanding patterns of viral diversity in wildlife and determinants of successful cross-species transmission, or spillover, are therefore key goals for pandemic surveillance programs. However, few analytical tools exist to identify which host species are likely to harbour the next human virus, or which viruses can cross species boundaries. Here we conduct a comprehensive analysis of mammalian host–virus relationships and show that both the total number of viruses that infect a given species and the proportion likely to be zoonotic are predictable. After controlling for research effort, the proportion of zoonotic viruses per species is predicted by phylogenetic relatedness to humans, host taxonomy and human population within a species range—which may reflect human–wildlife contact. We demonstrate that bats harbour a significantly higher proportion of zoonotic viruses than all other mammalian orders. We also identify the taxa and geographic regions with the largest estimated number of ‘missing viruses’ and ‘missing zoonoses’ and therefore of highest value for future surveillance. We then show that phylogenetic host breadth and other viral traits are significant predictors of zoonotic potential, providing a novel framework to assess if a newly discovered mammalian virus could infect people.

                <h4><a href="http://feeds.nature.com/~r/NatureBiologicalSciencesResearch/~3/JRpYx16e6Y8/nature22970">Crystal structure of the potassium-importing KdpFABC membrane complex</a></h4>

<p>
 Cellular potassium import systems play a fundamental role in osmoregulation, pH homeostasis and membrane potential in all domains of life. In bacteria, the kdp operon encodes a four-subunit potassium pump that maintains intracellular homeostasis, cell shape and turgor under conditions in which potassium is limiting. This membrane complex, called KdpFABC, has one channel-like subunit (KdpA) belonging to the superfamily of potassium transporters and another pump-like subunit (KdpB) belonging to the superfamily of P-type ATPases. Although there is considerable structural and functional information about members of both superfamilies, the mechanism by which uphill potassium transport through KdpA is coupled with ATP hydrolysis by KdpB remains poorly understood. Here we report the 2.9 Å X-ray structure of the complete Escherichia coli KdpFABC complex with a potassium ion within the selectivity filter of KdpA and a water molecule at a canonical cation site in the transmembrane domain of KdpB. The structure also reveals two structural elements that appear to mediate the coupling between these two subunits. Specifically, a protein-embedded tunnel runs between these potassium and water sites and a helix controlling the cytoplasmic gate of KdpA is linked to the phosphorylation domain of KdpB. On the basis of these observations, we propose a mechanism that repurposes protein channel architecture for active transport across biomembranes.

                <h4><a href="http://feeds.nature.com/~r/NatureBiologicalSciencesResearch/~3/mmv6Az-Z1uE/nature22967">Nlrp9b inflammasome restricts rotavirus infection in intestinal epithelial cells</a></h4>

<p>
 Rotavirus, a leading cause of severe gastroenteritis and diarrhoea in young children, accounts for around 215,000 deaths annually worldwide. Rotavirus specifically infects the intestinal epithelial cells in the host small intestine and has evolved strategies to antagonize interferon and NF-κB signalling, raising the question as to whether other host factors participate in antiviral responses in intestinal mucosa. The mechanism by which enteric viruses are sensed and restricted in vivo, especially by NOD-like receptor (NLR) inflammasomes, is largely unknown. Here we uncover and mechanistically characterize the NLR Nlrp9b that is specifically expressed in intestinal epithelial cells and restricts rotavirus infection. Our data show that, via RNA helicase Dhx9, Nlrp9b recognizes short double-stranded RNA stretches and forms inflammasome complexes with the adaptor proteins Asc and caspase-1 to promote the maturation of interleukin (Il)-18 and gasdermin D (Gsdmd)-induced pyroptosis. Conditional depletion of Nlrp9b or other inflammasome components in the intestine in vivo resulted in enhanced susceptibility of mice to rotavirus replication. Our study highlights an important innate immune signalling pathway that functions in intestinal epithelial cells and may present useful targets in the modulation of host defences against viral pathogens.

                <h4><a href="http://feeds.nature.com/~r/NatureBiologicalSciencesResearch/~3/5br55-bo1Ro/nature22822">Liquid droplet formation by HP1α suggests a role for phase separation in heterochromatin</a></h4>

<p>
 Gene silencing by heterochromatin is proposed to occur in part as a result of the ability of heterochromatin protein 1 (HP1) proteins to spread across large regions of the genome, compact the underlying chromatin and recruit diverse ligands. Here we identify a new property of the human HP1α protein: the ability to form phase-separated droplets. While unmodified HP1α is soluble, either phosphorylation of its N-terminal extension or DNA binding promotes the formation of phase-separated droplets. Phosphorylation-driven phase separation can be promoted or reversed by specific HP1α ligands. Known components of heterochromatin such as nucleosomes and DNA preferentially partition into the HP1α droplets, but molecules such as the transcription factor TFIIB show no preference. Using a single-molecule DNA curtain assay, we find that both unmodified and phosphorylated HP1α induce rapid compaction of DNA strands into puncta, although with different characteristics. We show by direct protein delivery into mammalian cells that an HP1α mutant incapable of phase separation in vitro forms smaller and fewer nuclear puncta than phosphorylated HP1α. These findings suggest that heterochromatin-mediated gene silencing may occur in part through sequestration of compacted chromatin in phase-separated HP1 droplets, which are dissolved or formed by specific ligands on the basis of nuclear context.

<p>
 Genetic studies have shown the association of Parkinson’s disease with alleles of the major histocompatibility complex. Here we show that a defined set of peptides that are derived from α-synuclein, a protein aggregated in Parkinson’s disease, act as antigenic epitopes displayed by these alleles and drive helper and cytotoxic T cell responses in patients with Parkinson’s disease. These responses may explain the association of Parkinson’s disease with specific major histocompatibility complex alleles.

                <h4><a href="http://feeds.nature.com/~r/NatureBiologicalSciencesResearch/~3/1jLtDXpAlUg/nature22814">Trans-kingdom mimicry underlies ribosome customization by a poxvirus kinase</a></h4>

<p>
 Ribosomes have the capacity to selectively control translation through changes in their composition that enable recognition of specific RNA elements. However, beyond differential subunit expression during development, evidence for regulated ribosome specification within individual cells has remained elusive. Here we report that a poxvirus kinase phosphorylates serine/threonine residues in the human small ribosomal subunit protein, receptor for activated C kinase (RACK1), that are not phosphorylated in uninfected cells or cells infected by other viruses. These modified residues cluster in an extended loop in RACK1, phosphorylation of which selects for translation of viral or reporter mRNAs with 5′ untranslated regions that contain adenosine repeats, so-called polyA-leaders. Structural and phylogenetic analyses revealed that although RACK1 is highly conserved, this loop is variable and contains negatively charged amino acids in plants, in which these leaders act as translational enhancers. Phosphomimetics and inter-species chimaeras have shown that negative charge in the RACK1 loop dictates ribosome selectivity towards viral RNAs. By converting human RACK1 to a charged, plant-like state, poxviruses remodel host ribosomes so that adenosine repeats erroneously generated by slippage of the viral RNA polymerase confer a translational advantage. Our findings provide insight into ribosome customization through trans-kingdom mimicry and the mechanics of species-specific leader activity that underlie poxvirus polyA-leaders.

                <h4><a href="http://feeds.nature.com/~r/NatureBiologicalSciencesResearch/~3/JZtaP7S5kxk/nature22383">Quantifiable predictive features define epitope-specific T cell receptor repertoires</a></h4>

<p>
 T cells are defined by a heterodimeric surface receptor, the T cell receptor (TCR), that mediates recognition of pathogen-associated epitopes through interactions with peptide and major histocompatibility complexes (pMHCs). TCRs are generated by genomic rearrangement of the germline TCR locus, a process termed V(D)J recombination, that has the potential to generate marked diversity of TCRs (estimated to range from 1015 (ref. 1) to as high as 1061 (ref. 2) possible receptors). Despite this potential diversity, TCRs from T cells that recognize the same pMHC epitope often share conserved sequence features, suggesting that it may be possible to predictively model epitope specificity. Here we report the in-depth characterization of ten epitope-specific TCR repertoires of CD8+ T cells from mice and humans, representing over 4,600 in-frame single-cell-derived TCRαβ sequence pairs from 110 subjects. We developed analytical tools to characterize these epitope-specific repertoires: a distance measure on the space of TCRs that permits clustering and visualization, a robust repertoire diversity metric that accommodates the low number of paired public receptors observed when compared to single-chain analyses, and a distance-based classifier that can assign previously unobserved TCRs to characterized repertoires with robust sensitivity and specificity. Our analyses demonstrate that each epitope-specific repertoire contains a clustered group of receptors that share core sequence similarities, together with a dispersed set of diverse ‘outlier’ sequences. By identifying shared motifs in core sequences, we were able to highlight key conserved residues driving essential elements of TCR recognition. These analyses provide insights into the generalizable, underlying features of epitope-specific repertoires and adaptive immune recognition.

<p>Thinking like a scientist is really hard, even for scientists. It requires putting aside your own prior beliefs, evaluating the quality and meaning of the evidence before you, and weighing it in the context of earlier findings. But parking your own agenda and staying objective is not the human way.</p>
<p>Consider that even though scientific evidence overwhelming supports the theory of evolution, a third of Americans think the theory is “absolutely false”. Similarly, the overwhelming scientific consensus is that human activity has contributed to climate change, yet around a third of Americans doubt it.</p>
<p>We Brits are just as blinkered. In a recent survey, over 96 per cent of teachers here said they believed pupils learn better when taught via their preferred learning style, even though scientific support for the concept is virtually non-existent. Why is it so hard to think like a scientist? In a <a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0079742116300214">new chapter</a> in the <em>Psychology of Learning and Motivation</em> book series, Priti Shah at the University of Michigan and her colleagues have taken a detailed look at the reasons, and here we pull out five key insights:</p>
<p><span id="more-25462"></span></p>
<p><strong>We’re swayed by anecdotes</strong><br />
When making everyday decisions, such as whether to begin a new treatment or sign up to a particular class at uni, most of us are influenced more powerfully by personal testimony from a single person than by impersonal ratings or outcomes averaged across many people. This is the power of anecdote to dull our critical faculties. In <a href="http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/13546783.2016.1139506?scroll=top&amp;needAccess=true">a study published last year</a> Fernando Rodriguez and his colleagues asked dozens of students to evaluate scientific news reports that drew inappropriate conclusions from weak evidence. Some of the reports opened with an anecdote supporting the inappropriate conclusion, other reports lacked an anecdote and acted as a control condition. Regardless of their level of university training or knowledge of scientific concepts, the students were less competent at critically evaluating the reports when they opened with an anecdote. “Anecdotal stories can undermine our ability to make scientifically driven judgements in real-world contexts,” the researchers said. Of course much health and science news in the mainstream media is delivered via anecdotes, increasing the likelihood that news consumers will swallow any claims whole.</p>
<p><strong>We’re overconfident</strong><br />
Confronted with a scientific claim, another reason many of us find it hard to reflect on it scientifically is that we overestimate our comprehension of the science. A <a href="http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/09636625030122001">study</a> from 2003 asked hundreds of university students to read several science news stories, to interpret them and rate their understanding. The students made many interpretative errors – for example, confusing correlation for causation – even though they thought they had a good understanding. This is redolent of <a href="http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v340/n6228/abs/340011a0.html">a survey from the 1980s</a> of thousands of British and American citizens: nearly 60 per cent stated they were moderately or very well-informed about new science findings and yet far fewer were able to answer easy questions about elementary science. Part of the problem seems to be that we infer our understanding of scientific text based on how well we have comprehended the language used. This means that popular science stories written in layman’s language can contribute to false confidence. This “fluency bias” can also apply to science lectures: a <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2013/05/14/engaging-lecturers-can-breed-overconfidence/">recent study</a> found that students overestimated the knowledge they’d derived from a science lecture when it was delivered by an engaging speaker.</p>
<p><strong>We’re biased by our prior beliefs</strong><br />
This obstacle to scientific objectivity was demonstrated by <a href="http://psycnet.apa.org/psycinfo/1981-05421-001">a now-classic study</a> from the 1970s in which participants were asked to evaluate scientific research that either supported or conflicted with their prior beliefs. For instance, one of the to-be-evaluated studies supposedly showed that murder rates tended to be lower in US states with the death penalty. Participants demonstrated an obvious bias in their evaluations. For example, if they supported capital punishment, they tended to evaluate the death penalty study favourably, whereas if they were against capital punishment, they were more likely to see the studies’ flaws. Scientific skills offer little protection against this bias, in fact they can compound it. A <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2319992">2013 study</a> asked participants to evaluate a piece of research on gun control. Participants with greater numeracy skills were especially biased: if the findings supported their existing beliefs, they were generous in their evaluation, but if the findings went against their beliefs, they used their skills to (in the words of Shah et al) “slam” the findings – a phenomenon dubbed “identity-protective cognition”.</p>
<p><strong>We’re seduced by graphs, formulas and meaningless neuroscience</strong><br />
It doesn’t take a lot to dazzle the average newspaper or magazine reader using the superficial props of science, be that formulas, graphics or jargon. Consider a study due for publication soon (Ibrahim et al, cited in the <a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0079742116300214">new chapter</a>): researchers asked their participants to consider a news story about a correlational study into genetically modified foods that was either consistent with the bulk of past research showing that they are safe, or was inconsistent, suggesting that they are harmful. Additionally, the story was either accompanied or not by a scatterplot of the new findings. When the news story had a graphic visualisation of the <em>correlational</em> evidence, which was inconsistent with the weight of past research (i.e. it implied a possibility of harm), participants were far more likely to interpret the new evidence as showing genetically modified foods <em>cause</em> harm, than if they had read the same story without a graphic. “This is especially worrisome,” write Shah et al, “since it demonstrates how easily people can be convinced by new data, regardless of the actual scientific merit of the result.” Similar research into readers’ critical skills has shown that they are blinded in a comparable manner by <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2015/04/17/psychology-students-are-seduced-by-superfluous-neuroscience/">gratuitous neuroscience jargon</a> and <a href="http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0963662514549688">meaningless formulas</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Being smart isn’t enough</strong><br />
Even expert researchers suffer from the human foibles that undermine scientific thinking. Their critical faculties are contaminated by their agenda, by their ultimate motives for doing their experiments. This is why the open science revolution occurring in psychology is so important: when researchers make their methods and hypotheses transparent, and they pre-register their studies, it makes it less likely that they will be diverted, even <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2012/08/09/made-it-an-uncanny-number-of-psychology-findings-manage-to-scrape-into-statistical-significance/">corrupted by,</a> confirmation bias (seeking out evidence to support their existing beliefs).</p>
<p>Take the example of systematic views in psychotherapy research: <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2017/02/20/concerning-study-says-psychotherapy-research-has-a-problem-with-undeclared-researcher-bias/">a recent analysis</a> found that the conclusions of many are spun in a way that supports the researchers’ own biases. Other times, <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2017/01/31/was-that-new-science-paper-hyped-and-over-interpreted-because-we-liked-its-message/">the whole scientific publishing community, from journals editors down to science journalists, seem to switch off their critical faculties</a> because they happen to agree with the message to emerge from a piece of research.</p>
<p>In their chapter, Shah and her colleagues point out that raw cognitive ability (IQ) is not a good predictor of a person’s ability to think like a scientist. More relevant is mental attitude, such as a person’s “need for cognition” and their ability or motivation to override gut instinct and reflect deeply. On a positive note, these mental dispositions may be more malleable, that is more trainable, than basic intelligence. But we’ll need plenty of solid evidence to test that.</p>

<p>The experiences of people who’ve been through a gender transition have been <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4977075/">studied and analysed</a> by psychologists – showing, for example, improved psychological wellbeing and self-esteem after hormone treatment. But when it comes to their partners, there’s been much less research. According to a <a href="http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0265407517709360?ai=1gvoi&amp;mi=3ricys&amp;af=R">new study</a> in the <i>Journal of Social and Personal Relationships</i>, though, they often go through a kind of life transition of their own, and while there are certainly challenges, there are often positive changes, too.</p>
<p><span id="more-25437"></span></p>
<p>Lisa Platt at West Virginia University, US and Kayla Bolland at New Mexico State University conducted semi-structured interviews with 21 partners of transgender people – these partners were both female to male and male to female, plus there was a group that identified as gender neutral or fluid. The interviewees themselves were mostly not heterosexual, they lived in the US or Canada, and they included 13 cisgender women (women who’s gender identity matches their birth sex), 2 cisgender men, 4 transgender people, and 2 people with fluid or bi-gender identities.</p>
<p>Some of the interviewees had started their relationship after their transgender partner had transitioned; others were in their relationship before their partner had begun their transition process. Although there’s a common perception that relationships usually end when one member changes gender, this isn’t necessarily the case. For instance, in <a href="http://uh.edu/class/psychology/clinical-psych/research/dpl/_files/publications/Meier-Sharp-Michonski-Babcock-and-Fitzgerald_2013.pdf">one recent study</a>, about half of a group of transgender men who were in relationship before their transition kept up that relationship afterwards.</p>
<p>The interviews involved open-ended questions, such as “Discuss how your relationship has impacted your sexual orientation, if at all?”. Many of the participants reported practical safety concerns for their transgender partners, such as physical attacks from hostile members of the public. But there were concerns relating to their own psychological wellbeing, too. Most had previous connections in the LGBTQ (Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Trans, Queer) community, the researchers wrote, but as a partner of a transgender person, they felt excluded and marginalised.</p>
<p>For example, one woman whose partner had made a female to male transition (FTM) had previously identified as lesbian, but now identified as queer – a less-specific term for a non-straight sexual orientation. Many interviewees felt this better described their sexual orientation after their partner transitioned – they don’t feel straight, but not gay or lesbian any more, either. “Do we still fit in the lesbian community?” the woman asked, “it’s something we’re still trying to figure out.” Another interviewee, also a female partner of someone who had made the FTM  transition, said, “You do give up something as a partner because you’re all lesbians together and a lot of lesbians don’t like it when other lesbians transition. I don’t know why.”</p>
<p>One participant explained how she felt ignored. “Everything is always about trans people, trans people, trans people. And you know, partners are completely eclipsed – and our sexuality is completely eclipsed, and we have no voice in the community really.”</p>
<p>And yet, many reported undergoing major changes in their own lives. Physical changes to their partner meant changed sexual experiences, for example, and many reported questioning their own sexual orientation, or relabelling themselves (with the term queer, for instance). But some reported that this was a positive experience (“It’s definitely opened my eyes to helping me understand myself better and what I’m attracted to and not be putting myself in a box like I used to,” said one.) Some also talked about having a welcome, new understanding of the gender spectrum, and about how the need for more communication about what feels comfortable for both partners led to greater closeness and intimacy.</p>
<p>Overall, it’s important to remember, one interviewee stressed, “that as your partner transitions, what you’re going through is a transition of your own.”</p>
<p>Although this is a little-researched area, there are organisations that provide advice to partners of trans people:</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">Whilst research into the health of this vulnerable population is increasing, as shown in <a href="https://bmcinthealthhumrights.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12914-017-0116-4">this</a> bibliometric analysis, published in <a href="https://bmcinthealthhumrights.biomedcentral.com/"><em>BMC International Health &amp; Human Rights</em></a> there are still many challenges on how best to reach and treat refugees.  Below we discuss a selection of <a href="https://www.biomedcentral.com/p/the-bmc-series-journals"><em>BMC series</em></a> research into the health challenges experienced by refugees.</p>
<p>As many refugees have suffered physical or psychological stress it is perhaps unsurprising that mental health conditions are prevalent in the population. In a <a href="https://bmcpsychiatry.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12888-017-1239-9">study</a> published in <a href="https://bmcpsychiatry.biomedcentral.com"><em>BMC Psychiatry</em></a> the prevalence of mental health illness amongst refugees and asylum-seekers in Australia was measured at 50.4%, with approximately a third having had post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms at some point. In a Danish <a href="https://bmcpsychiatry.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12888-016-1166-1">study</a> of refugees it was shown PTSD was sometimes accompanied by secondary psychotic symptoms, likely to be linked to severe interpersonal traumas such as torture and imprisonment.</p>
<p>In this <a href="https://bmcpublichealth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12889-016-3953-5">study</a> in <a href="https://bmcpublichealth.biomedcentral.com/"><em>BMC Public Health</em></a> the rates of depressive symptoms in African asylum-seekers and refugees in Hong Kong was examined. Whilst a significant proportion of this population exhibited depressive symptoms those who lived alone were more likely to suffer. In addition those who reported discrimination or difficulties accessing healthcare also had an increased likelihood of experiencing depressive symptoms highlighting the value of social support.</p>
<p>A number of studies have looked at why refugee populations find healthcare difficult to access. Primary healthcare workers (HCWs) are aware of the issues refugees face and in this <a href="https://bmcpsychiatry.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12888-016-1048-6">study</a>, from Switzerland, HCWs identified a lack of adequate financial resources, housing, and access to employment as important factors in creating barriers to accessing healthcare. In addition the HCWs considered that a lack of information about services and a fear of stigmatization were preventing refugees from accessing mental healthcare.</p>
<p>Refugee youth are at elevated risk of mental health and alcohol and other drug problems and <a href="https://bmcpublichealth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12889-017-4186-y">this</a> study looking at refugee youths in South Australia highlighted a lack of awareness of services and the fragmented nature of them as causing major barriers to access.</p>
<figure class="wp-caption alignright" id="attachment_9162" style="width: 310px;"><img alt="" class="size-medium wp-image-9162" height="225" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2017/06/4263462042_407265e42e_z-300x225.jpg" width="300" /><div class="attachment-image--caption">Evan Bench on Flickr</div><div class="attachment-image--source"></div></figure>
<p>In addition to mental health conditions there are other areas where refugees are at an increased risk. This <a href="https://bmcinthealthhumrights.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12914-016-0085-z">study</a> showed that children of North Korean refugees in China had significantly lower vaccination rates compared to Chinese or migrant children. Unvaccinated children are at risk of many preventable infectious diseases such as measles, diphtheria and pertussis.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://bmcpediatr.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12887-017-0888-7">this study</a>, published in <a href="https://bmcpediatr.biomedcentral.com/"><em>BMC Pediatrics</em></a> new immigrant and refugee children arriving in Greece were shown to commonly lack immunization records, have poor dental health and present with elevated blood lead levels. Many of the conditions reported were manageable but if undiagnosed or left untreated, could lead to poor health outcomes.</p>
<p>Doubtless the work discussed in this blog barely scratches the surface of the challenges facing refugee populations across the world. Clearly further research is needed and, even more importantly, concerted action required from governments and NGOs to tackle these issues and improve the lives of some of the world’s most vulnerable people</p>

<img alt="" class="attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image" height="110" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2017/06/The-National-Center-for-Advancing-Translational-Sciences-NCATS-Flickr-CC-140x110.jpg" style="display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;" width="140" /><p> </p>
<p>According to the <a href="http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs308/en/">World Health Organization</a> 5% of the world’s population carries a hemoglobin disorder gene and 300,000 infants are born each year with hemoglobin disorders including SCD. Furthermore, the vast majority of cases of SCD occur in sub-saharan Africa.</p>
<p>SCD is a genetic disorder which results in a mutation in the hemoglobin gene and causes red blood cells to develop into a misshapen, sickle-like shape.  These red blood cells will stick to the inside of blood vessels thereby blocking appropriate blood flow.</p>
<figure class="wp-caption alignright" id="attachment_9153" style="width: 310px;"><img alt="" class="wp-image-9153 size-medium" height="205" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2017/06/Sickle_cell_distribution-300x205.jpg" width="300" /><div class="attachment-image--caption">Distribution of the sickle-cell trait shown in pink and purple (By Muntuwandi at English Wikipedia, CC BY-SA 3.0)</div><div class="attachment-image--source"></div></figure>
<p>SCD dramatically <a href="https://bmchematol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12878-017-0079-7">reduces the quality of life</a> due to a wide variety complications including chronic anemia, gall stone disease, painful crisis, refractive eye disorders, heart disease, chronic leg ulcers, septic arthritis, and enuresis.  Individuals with SCD are also more susceptible to infections such a tuberculosis, septic arthritis, and osteomyelitis.</p>
<p>Some well-established behavioral and drug techniques have been discovered to reduce SCD symptomology and include restriction from strenuous activity, giving plenty of fluids, balanced diet, dressing in warm clothing, anti-malarial drugs, and analgesics.  These treatments are often used to manage symptoms but not necessarily the physiological repercussions of having SCD. One potential treatment that has received some recent attention is Gum Arabic comes from the Acacia Senegal tree, and it has potential for treating SCD in more than one way.</p>
<p>Gum Arabic has been found to have potent anti-oxidant properties and has been shown to act as an effective anti-oxidant in animal models of chronic renal failure, urinary bladder cytotoxicity, and cardiotoxicity. Individuals with SCD have high levels of oxidative stress due to the formation of reactive oxygen species such as hydrogen peroxide. High levels of oxidative stress can have serious physiological repercussions such as endometrial dysfunction and multiple organ damage.</p>
<figure class="wp-caption alignright" id="attachment_9156" style="width: 198px;"><img alt="" class="size-medium wp-image-9156" height="300" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2017/06/Sickle_cell_01-188x300.jpg" width="188" /><div class="attachment-image--caption">Wikipedia, public domain</div><div class="attachment-image--source"></div></figure>
<p><a href="https://bmchematol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12878-017-0075-y">Kaddan and colleagues</a> sought to determine whether Gum Arabic’s anti-oxidant effects could reduce the high levels of oxidative stress in individuals with SCD. Daily administration of Gum Arabic for 12 weeks resulted in an increase in total anti-oxidants and a reduction of the reactive oxygen species, hydrogen peroxide, as well as a decrease in malondiadehyde, an indicator of oxidative stress. Despite these positive findings, it is important to note that the authors measured only certain markers of oxidative stress and other physiological measures were not taken therefore it is difficult to conclude whether these anti-oxidative effects could actually reduce organ damage.</p>
<p>Gum Arabic could have beneficial effects beyond its anti-oxidant properties. Gum Arabic could also increase the production of fetal hemoglobin, a form of hemoglobin with a greater affinity for oxygen compared to adult hemoglobin. Fetal hemoglobin appears to prevent red blood cells from forming the sickle shape thereby decreasing the chance of vaso-occlusive events. Hydroxyurea is an FDA approved drug that can increase fetal hemoglobin, however, since the drug is expensive and patients require frequent monitoring for toxicity hydroxyurea is not a realistic treatment for individuals in developing countries. Gum Arabic, however, is considered a safe dietary fiber and when orally administered for twelve weeks both <a href="https://bmchematol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12878-015-0040-6">children and adults experience an increase in fetal hemoglobin</a>. These results seem promising but since neither painful crisis nor vaso-occlusive events were measured it is unclear whether this increase in fetal hemoglobin would have significant physiological effects.</p>
<p>There is still a significant amount of research required to find effective treatments in stabilizing, if not curing, this debilitating disease that results in low quality of life and an increased risk of premature death. Hopefully, when every World Sickle Disease Day arrives there will be more and more treatments to help this population. With foundations such as <a href="http://sicklecellfoundation.org/">Sickle Cell Foundation</a>, <a href="http://sicklecellcurefoundation.org/">Sickle Cell Cure Foundation</a>, and sources of public funding the lives of these afflicted individuals will improve.</p>

The <strong><a href="http://www.esf.edu/top10/" target="_blank">Top 10 New Species</a></strong> list honors the legacy of Swedish botanist Carolus Linnaeus, known for his pioneering work on the hierarchical classification of plants and animals that developed beyond genus and species into modern taxonomy. The list is compiled by the International Institute for Species Exploration (<strong><a href="http://www.esf.edu/species/" target="_blank">IISE</a></strong>) working with a panel of international scientists as selection committee members.</p>

<p>PLOS spoke with Quentin Wheeler, founding director of IISE and president of the College of Environmental Science and Forestry in Syracuse, New York, on assessing research impact, the purpose and influence of this list and the impact of climate change on species diversity.</p>
<h4><strong>Policies and Purpose</strong></h4>
<p>Research reporting these new species is published in a variety of journal types, from subscription to Open Access. When asked if there are considerations of access to research when the members of the international selection committee evaluate nominations, Wheeler states that “the selection committee is encouraged to focus on the organisms rather than where they were published.” This de-emphasis on journal choice is a hallmark of the IISE selection process; work that is posted on a preprint server, rather than published in a peer-reviewed journal, may also be eligible for consideration. “What matters is compliance with the international codes of (botanical and zoological) nomenclature which requires publication that can now include electronic publication. So long as the requirements of the code were met during the previous calendar year, a species is eligible for consideration,” he says.</p>
<p>In an era of continued global extinction of animals, plants and microbes, Wheeler hopes the Top 10 New Species list brings research outcomes to the public that help convey the <strong><a href="http://collections.plos.org/eco-climate-change" target="_blank">acute relevance of climate change</a></strong>. “Our goal is to increase awareness of the loss of species in the biodiversity crisis and the important roles played by taxonomy and natural history museums in biodiversity exploration and conservation. The wide media attention gained by the Top 10 (and this year’s <strong><a href="http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article/related?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0156709" target="_blank"><em>PLOS ONE</em> article</a></strong>) has hopefully played a role toward that goal,” he says. While he is not aware of specific policies shaped directly by the list, the hope is that it “keeps the importance of species exploration in the minds of those making such policies.”</p>
<h4><strong>Valuing Work, Not Impact Factor</strong></h4>
<p>Over the past 10 years of generating this list, one notable detail is that selected work is published in journals with impact factors ranging from less than one to greater than 20. When asked what this says to him and the scientific community about the value and relevance of evaluating a work based on its own merit, rather than on the journal in which it appears, Wheeler is quite direct.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>“As a scientist and scholar, I like to think that science is a meritocracy of ideas and that their value derives from the quality of the work and its impact rather than the impact factor of the journal overall. Taxonomy is a very special case that is not at all served well by impact factors as they are today calculated.”</strong></p></blockquote>
<p>He explains this concept more fully. “First, the best taxonomic work is comprehensive and comparative in the form of lengthy taxonomic revisions and monographs. Such long works are not accepted by most journals with high impact factors. Second, even the best taxonomic work is rarely cited because once species are known they are typically identified by field biologists through secondary literature (field guides, etc.). Even the secondary literature is often omitted from citations by ecologists and others, and the primary literature is only rarely cited outside of other taxonomy papers.” Due to the long-term nature of taxonomy work, “we routinely consult papers from 1758 forward,” says Wheeler. “Thus the true impact of the work is measured over generations which is quite different from most experimental fields where papers are outdated in just a few years.”</p>
<p>Last year <strong><a href="http://www.esf.edu/top10/2016/" target="_blank">two species on the list</a></strong> made their debuts in <em>PLOS ONE</em>: the description of a new <strong><a href="http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0138779" target="_blank">Galapagos giant tortoise species</a></strong> and a new <strong><a href="http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0115021" target="_blank">genus, species and subfamily of isopod crustacean</a></strong>. Together with this year’s winner and the four <strong><a href="http://blogs.plos.org/plos/2015/07/key-new-species-discoveries-2014/" target="_blank"><em>PLOS ONE</em> articles</a></strong> describing top species in 2014, this cohort of articles has collectively received over 290,000 views, 3,500 shares and broad media coverage since publication, indicating their influence and interest for taxonomists and the public at large.</p>
<h4><strong>Connectivity and Credit</strong></h4>
<p>As with other scientific disciplines, innovation and modernization are a must in taxonomy, and Wheeler is in favor of such policy shifts. First, he recommends mandating a “central deposition of all nomenclatural acts, including descriptions of new species” as it now takes several years to track down all new species named in any given year. He also believes “the actual technical description of species should be open access, even in journals that are not. The descriptive material should be intellectual property of humankind and available to everyone.”</p>
<p>Further modernization, according to Wheeler, would establish electronic connectivity between published work and the central repository. “That central repository, likely IPNI for botany and ZooBank for zoology,” he says, “ought to be connected via hyperlink to every scientific name published. Were this done it would be a service to editors by assuring the correct scientific name is being used and spelled correctly. Also by virtue of that link we could electronically track the usage of scientific names and give “impact” measure of the use of the names as credit to the taxonomists.”</p>
<p>PLOS encourages scientists making these discoveries to publish the entire research article, not just the technical data, in fully Open Access journals and <strong><a href="http://journals.plos.org/plosone/s/data-availability#loc-recommended-repositories" target="_blank">repositories</a></strong> to ensure the work has maximum visibility and reach. <strong><a href="https://www.plos.org/orcid" target="_blank">ORCID iDs</a></strong> can help in linking taxonomy descriptions, datasets, published work and grants to individual researchers for maximum credit and recognition. Those interested in learning more about the biodiversity crisis can watch a <strong><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-MbJw57LXM" target="_blank">brief interview</a></strong> with Quentin Wheeler and those interested in learning more about new species and biodiversity can browse <strong><a href="http://plos.io/TaxonomyNewSpecies" target="_blank">this selection of PLOS articles</a></strong>.</p>

<p>After chemotherapy treatment, many patients say their mind has been affected. For example they describe symptoms such as feeling confused, memory problems and difficulty concentrating – a phenomenon that has been dubbed “chemobrain” (<a href="http://www.cancerresearchuk.org/about-cancer/cancer-in-general/treatment/chemotherapy/side-effects-chemotherapy/chemo-brain/about">Cancer Research UK has more information</a>).</p>
<p>The causes are little understood. Are these apparent neuropsychological effects due to a direct physical effect of chemotherapy on the brain? Or could it be the stress and worry involved in chemotherapy that is responsible? Perhaps it’s both. To find out more, Mi Sook Jung at Chungnam National University in South Korea, and colleagues, conducted repeated brain scans and neuropsych tests with breast cancer patients undergoing chemo and compared them with similar cancer patients not on chemo and healthy controls. Reporting their <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11682-016-9507-8?wt_mc=alerts.TOCjournals">results</a> in <em>Brain Imaging and Behaviour</em>, the researchers hope a better understanding of the nature of “chemobrain” and its causes will make it possible for health professionals to offer patients better support and care.</p>
<p><span id="more-25198"></span></p>
<p>The participants were 28 women who’d had surgery for breast cancer and were waiting to start chemo; 34 women with breast cancer of similar severity, also post-surgery, but awaiting radiotherapy without chemo; and 30 age-matched healthy controls (average age across groups was 52, and the women were predominantly white and well-educated).</p>
<p>On three occasions, all the participants completed tests of their verbal working memory while having their brains scanned. To provide a baseline, they completed their first tests before the chemo group had begun their chemotherapy treatment; the second test was at least one month after chemo; and the third and final test was 12 months after the baseline (and 7 months after chemotherapy for the chemo group). The women also reported their cancer symptoms, any cognitive complains and psychological stress.</p>
<p>The chemo patients performed worse at the memory task, and their lower performance became more obvious over the course of the year: whereas the other patients and healthy controls improved on each test (just as you’d expect with repeated practice), the chemo patients did not. Throughout, the chemotherapy patients’ brain scans also showed some signs of a lack of neural efficiency at the front of their brains while they completed the memory tests, although this only reached statistical significance in comparison with the other groups at the final test.</p>
<p>In terms of subjective cognitive complaints (for example, how much the participants said they experience memory problems in everyday life), there were actually no group differences. In other words, if the researchers had relied on self-report, rather than conducting memory tests and brain scans, they wouldn’t have found evidence for chemobrain as such. Across all the cancer patients, the greater their psychological distress and the more severe their cancer symptoms, the more that they tended to complain of cognitive problems.</p>
<p>Taken together, the researchers said there could be two distinct phenomena here: the subjective cognitive problems associated with cancer may be caused predominantly by anxiety and the burden of cancer symptoms; at the same time, chemotherapy may be having an additional, compounding effect on brain function, which showed up in the memory tests and brain scans.</p>
<p>Focusing on why chemotherapy treatment has these additional adverse effects, the researchers believe part of this is likely the anxiety and stress specifically involved in the chemotherapy experience, such as anticipation of hair loss and other toxic effects. Supporting this, the chemo patients actually showed some signs of altered brain function even before they’d started their chemotherapy.  However, having chemotherapy was still associated with greater risk of neural inefficiency, even after putting levels of psychological distress into the analysis, which points to a direct organic effect of chemotherapy on the brain, compounding the psychological toll (stronger evidence for a direct organic effect of chemotherapy on brain function, separate from psychological causes, would require a controlled experiment with some patients allocated to a “sham” chemotherapy condition, though this would surely be unethical).</p>
<p>This is a relatively small study with complex findings and much more research is clearly needed, including into how and why chemotherapy might directly effect brain function. The researchers said “considerable research is underway to identify biological mechanisms by which chemotherapy alters neural function (e.g., inflammatory cytokine production, genetic predisposition), [but that] research also is needed to explicate the mechanism linking symptom burden and self-reported cognitive problems.”</p>

<p>Recognition of microbial pathogens is key for innate immune function. This is done in macrophages by intracellular receptors known as NLRs, which then activate the inflammasome to defend against colonization by intracellular bacteria. Salmonella, however, has developed effectors that allow it to evade the inflammasome response. This study used recombinant Salmonella to test whether inflammasome activation could be triggered and whether that would affect bacterial colonization in vivo in mice. It was found that the recombinant bacteria increased activation of the inflammasome, thereby reducing bacterial counts and organ damage in the infected mice. This could lead to general application in vaccine design, encouraging activation of the immune system against a range of intracellular pathogens.</p>

<p>Interpretation of facial expression is an important element of regulating social interaction. A recent study compared hostile attribution bias in violent criminals as compared to non-violent offenders and controls in the general population. Hostile attribution bias is the interpretation of ambiguous facial expressions as hostile, often leading to aggressive behavior. Violent offenders showed greater hostile attribution bias than non-violent offenders or controls, suggesting one mechanism underlying a tendency towards physical violence.</p>

<p>As electronic health record (EHR) use becomes more common, more negative effects are seen on the physician-patient relationship from the use of EHR. While several recommendations have been published to try to mitigate these effects, few studies have tested whether these recommendations are helpful in real patient interactions. A new study aimed to introduce training on EHR-related communication skills of residents with real patients and asses its impact on physician-patient interactions. After the training, physicians said that they were more comfortable using EHR overall and were seen to be using it less in situations where patients might feel that it was a barrier to communication.</p>

<p>One method of overcoming the growing problem of antibiotic resistance is the use of combination therapies, two or more antibiotic drugs together. Identifying which drugs are most effective together is complicated by the rare occurrence of suppressive interactions, in which the drugs together are less effective than either alone. These suppressive combinations, while they are less effective at killing bacteria, may be better for combating the development of antibiotic resistance. This study looked for suppressive interactions in three-drug combinations, especially “emergent” suppressive interactions that reduce growth better than the single drugs but not as well as the pairwise combinations. Fourteen antibiotic drugs were tested in all possible combinations on three strains of bacteria. Pairwise suppressive interactions were rare, with only 5% of combinations failing to reduce growth more than the single drugs but 17% of three-drug combinations showing suppressive interaction as compared to the pairwise combinations. These emergent suppressive interactions may be clinically useful to balance between the needs of effective killing of bacteria in an individual patient and reducing the development of antibiotic resistance across a population.</p>

<p>The plant cuticle is the outermost tissue layer and it is important in protecting the plant from environmental stresses, such as drought. Cuticle properties such as wax composition and glaucousness may control water loss and thereby contribute to drought tolerance. A new study examined water loss in five strains of wheat to compare leaf cuticle properties between strains with different drought tolerances and within strains grown in drought and non-drought conditions. The relationship found between cuticle properties and drought tolerance was not simple and included changes in wax composition, amount, and crystal structure. These relationships could be useful for selecting plants with higher drought resistance.</p>

<p>Sleep is an essential contributor to healthy child development and lack of sleep can contribute to obesity, low academic achievement, and other negative outcomes for children and their families. Parental behaviors can significantly influence child sleep quality and duration both positively and negatively. This study aimed to determine the relative contribution of various parental behaviors intended to support healthy sleep to children meeting healthy sleep guidelines. The results of the survey show that parental enforcement of bedtime rules, not just encouragement to follow routine, predicted increased sleep duration in children.</p>

<p><em>By</em> <a href="http://www.alexfradera.net/">Alex Fradera</a></p>
<p>In the early 1950s, while investigating rabbits’ sense of smell by recording the activity of their brain cells, the scientist Lord Adrian noticed something curious. As his team mixed up odours of increasing strength, to see at what point the rabbits’ neurons fired in response, they found the critical threshold appeared around the same point that they were able to smell the odour themselves: in other words, this suggested that the smell had become noticeable to animal and man at the same time.</p>
<p>On publication of the research, Lord Adrian mentioned his observation, but it didn’t provoke a serious response, presumably because informed scientists knew that the human sense of smell is generally pathetic. Everyone knew… but they knew wrong. In a new <a href="http://science.sciencemag.org/content/356/6338/eaam7263.full">review</a> in <i>Science</i>, John McGann, who runs the Rutgers Laboratory on the Neurobiology of Sensory Cognition, takes us through the historical misunderstandings to reach the truth about what the human nose knows.</p>
<p><span id="more-25280"></span></p>
<p>The history of the idea that humans can’t smell very well begins with the French neuroanatomist Paul Broca (immortalised through <a href="http://https//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Broca%25252527s_area">Broca’s</a> brain area), who, facing hostility from the Catholic Church, was defiantly set on making the case for a unique human intelligence that wasn’t due to an invisible soul, but to physical brain features, specifically our large frontal lobes.</p>
<p>To tighten his story, Broca suggested that, in humans, the notably small brain volume taken up by the olfactory bulb, which processes smell (biologists call the sense of smell “olfaction”), reflected a redirection of resources from smell, which guides lower animals, into the higher functions. His argument gained intuitive strength from the fact that in humans the small bulb sits directly against the expanded frontal area. This supported the idea that a poor human sense of smell testifies to human exceptionalism, to our separation from the lowly beast. You can also see this theme in Freud’s work: he claimed smell was connected to instinctual sexual behaviour, and that although it was “usually atrophied” in humans, it connected us “to early animal forms of life.”</p>
<p>But Broca’s original neuroanatomical case doesn’t hold much water. Yes, the human olfactory bulb is small compared to the rest of our (relatively large) brain, but the same is true in other animals. Although across the animal kingdom the brain scales up in relation to body size (larger animals require larger somatosensory systems to represent their greater skin surface, which is why elephants and whales have enormous brains), the olfactory bulb is an important exception to this rule. This might be because however big or small you are, smell always begins at the nostrils.</p>
<p>A different indicator of smell specialisation could be the density of neurons in the olfactory bulb, but this density doesn’t vary greatly from species to species either, and what difference there is doesn’t give us a clear picture: although the bulb of a mouse is neurally denser than that of a human male, it’s less dense than that of a human female.</p>
<p>Admittedly, there are differences in the human olfactory system compared with other animals: for instance, a lack of adult neurogenesis in the olfactory bulb (in humans the growth of new neurons occurs in other regions including the hippocampus and striatum). This could be taken as evidence of less “plasticity” in the human smell system. However, humans appear well-able to adjust and learn to pick up even previously imperceptible smells, for example <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18369149">through aversive conditioning</a>, possibly through reuse of the existing neural resources. So the neuroanatomical evidence that we have feeble odour-detecting isn’t compelling.</p>
<p>Yet the proof is in the smelling. But before you picture the trusted tracker dog, or mouse questing for cheese, ask yourself whether they, like some humans, would be able to distinguish own-brand from top-end potato crisps, or tell a Merlot from a Pinot Noir. Because the truth is, Lord Adrian’s observation reflects a wider truth: while in some instances our sense of smell falls well behind other mammals, in others, it proves itself a match, and in others still, comes out the winner.</p>
<p>As McGann points out, “humans with intact olfactory systems can detect virtually all volatile chemicals larger than an atom or two, to the point that it has been a matter of scientific interest to document the few odorants that some people cannot smell.” Recent research suggests we may be able to theoretically distinguish between, not thousands of different odorants, but up to a <a href="http://https//www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24653035">trillion</a>! The exact smell matter is critical. For example, on two chemically related compounds, humans outperformed mice on one, but lagged behind them on another.</p>
<p>On reflection, this tallies well with the human experience. It’s clear that, like <a href="http://https//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_Search_of_Lost_Time%2523Memory">Proust’s experience with his madeleine cake</a>, smell has a great power <a href="http://https//www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24575071">to evoke memory</a>; that it guides matters of <a href="http://https//www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25637403">physical attraction</a>; that it can tip us off to <a href="http://https//www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3309140/">someone’s emotional state</a>. The texts that once categorised us as an “anosmatic” species – without smell, like dolphins and whales – got it way wrong, brought off course by ideology and a reluctance to actually look at the facts. Luckily, many scientists since have gone on to do the necessary work, by following their noses.</p>

<img alt="" class="attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image" height="110" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2017/06/maxpixel.freegreatpicture.com-Dog-Walking-Animal-Dogs-Pet-Walking-Dog-Walk-1070076-140x110.jpg" style="display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;" width="140" /><p>You could attribute many of a dog’s characteristics to why they’re known as “man’s best friend.”</p>
<p>They’re loyal, entertaining, trustworthy — they won’t tell a soul how long you binge-watched Netflix last weekend — and of course, they’re adorable. But when you’re not cuddled up together streaming shows, dogs can give their owners one of the greatest gifts of all: improved health.</p>
<p>Scientists have studied the influence of dog ownership on physical activity many times, and almost every study has found the same to be true: Owning a dog will cause a person’s activity level to increase and be higher in comparison to those who don’t have a dog.</p>
<h3><strong>The average dog owner walks more than non-owners</strong></h3>
<blockquote><p>Glasgow Caledonian University researchers found dog owners in this age range spent 22 minutes more walking and took around 2,760 extra steps every day.</p></blockquote>
<p>This one might seem obvious, but having a dog essentially forces owners to exercise more than they might have without a pet. This statistic appears to hold true, especially regarding owners ages 65 and up. As <a href="http://www.worldatlas.com/articles/countries-with-the-largest-aging-population-in-the-world.html">populations around the world</a> continue to age, keeping older people active could be imperative to countries’ continued economic growth and the daily functioning of societies.</p>
<p><a href="https://bmcpublichealth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12889-017-4422-5">Glasgow Caledonian University researchers</a> found dog owners in this age range spent 22 minutes more walking and took around 2,760 extra steps every day.</p>
<p>In addition to spending more of their time walking, the study found dog owners had less frequent sedentary periods than non-dog owners. Though the amount of time spent sitting down was the same among the two groups, simply getting up and moving more frequently is enough to boost your physical and mental health.</p>
<p>To collect this data, researchers used a case-controlled design in which study participants were matched using a range of demographic variables. Participants were recruited using ads at local community groups, veterinary offices and local radio and press outlets.</p>
<p>The final sample size included 40 adults aged 65 and older, who resided at private residences and had no scheduled health interventions that could bias their physical activity during the study.</p>
<h3><strong>Dogs encourage people with medical conditions to get outside</strong></h3>
<p><img alt="" class="size-medium wp-image-9145 alignright" height="249" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2017/06/34414326953_747d49f1a9_z-2-300x249.jpg" width="300" />For individuals who have medical conditions that could act up at any time, simply going outside for a walk could be nerve-wracking. If this is you, consider choosing a service dog as your pet. These animals not only provide the same benefits as an ordinary pet, but they also give their owners feelings of independence, courage and peace.</p>
<p>Service dogs could be helpful for people with autism, diabetes, vision impairments, deafness and more. There are even dogs <a href="http://k94life.org/seizure-alert/">trained to help people</a> who suffer from seizures. Individuals who suffer from emotional problems such as panic attacks, separation anxiety, depression or dyslexia could find that service dogs can improve their quality of life too.</p>
<h3><strong>The bottom line: dogs motivate owners to exercise</strong></h3>
<p>If you’ve been feeling like you need a reason to get up and move — and you’re potentially a bit lonely — getting a dog could be beneficial to you. Of course you should always consider whether you are in a position to <a href="https://www.pdsa.org.uk/taking-care-of-your-pet/choosing-a-pet">appropriately care</a> for a potential pet’s needs.</p>
<p>Along with the unconditional love and new adventures your new four-legged friend will bring into your life, you’ll most likely be exercising more frequently and improving both of your well-beings. Now, that’s love.</p>

<img alt="" class="attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image" height="110" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2017/06/1280px-Water_snail_Rex_2-140x110.jpg" style="display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;" width="140" /><p>Populations of numerous species are currently threatened by global climate change. Many species have already shown range shifts as a response to changing climatic conditions. This can increase their probability to survive in the future. However, many species are not able to disperse as effectively as required, and even those that can will experience new and often suboptimal environmental conditions outside their current range.</p>
<p>Owing to the limitations of “quick fixes” in front of climate change, the persistence of natural populations of many organisms will depend on their ability to evolutionarily adapt to changing climatic conditions to overcome their negative effects.</p>
<p>Unfortunately evolutionary adaptation is never guaranteed. A prerequisite for evolutionary change is within-population heritable variation across individuals in the traits determining fitness (i.e. survival and reproductive success). In case of climate change, this would mean that the harmful effects of altered climatic conditions (e.g. heat waves, droughts) on natural populations would become smaller in the future only if (1) individuals showed variation in their sensitivity to climate change-mediated stress, (2) this helped them to produce more offspring compared with other individuals in the population, and (3) also their offspring showed higher tolerance to altered climatic conditions.</p>

<p>We examined the adaptive potential in responses to heat waves in a population of the great pond snail (<em>Lymnaea stagnalis</em>). These snails are common in freshwater habitats across the northern hemisphere. They are important grazers in their habitats, and serve as intermediate hosts for a community of parasites some of which cause wide losses, for instance, in aquaculture. Thus, their responses and potential for adaptation to climate change can have wide consequences for ecosystem functioning and disease epidemiology in freshwater systems.</p>
<p>By exposing snails to experimental heat waves in a laboratory we found that at high temperatures, snails grew larger and reproduced more while their immune defence (two out of three examined immune traits) was reduced. Thus, snails gained immediate benefits in form of high growth rate and reproductive output during a heat wave, but this came with a cost of reduced parasite resistance. Could the snails evolve to experience smaller costs during future heat waves?</p>
<p>Examining snails from different families within the population revealed that although the investigated traits showed high genetic variation, their responses to high temperature were largely similar. Only one of the studied immune traits showed variation across families in its reduction under a heat wave. Therefore, individuals whose immune function suffered the least from high temperature could pass this ability to future generations.</p>
<p>Our findings suggest that snails show some genetic potential for adaptation to climate change. This may reduce the negative effects of heat waves on snail resistance against parasites in the future, thus reducing the disease risk induced by extreme weather conditions. These effects were, however, limited since most of the examined traits did not show such variation.</p>
