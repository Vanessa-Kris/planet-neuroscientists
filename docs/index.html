              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/nuclear-imaging-prototype-tumors-glow-cerenkov-light">A new nuclear imaging prototype detects tumors’ faint glow</a></h4>

              
                <p>A type of light commonly observed in astrophysics experiments and nuclear reactors can help detect cancer. In a clinical trial, a prototype of an imaging machine that relies on this usually bluish light, called Cerenkov radiation, successfully <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41551-022-00876-4#citeas">captured the presence and location</a> of cancer patients’ tumors, researchers report April 11 in <em>Nature Biomedical Engineering</em>.</p>



<p>When compared with standard scans of the tumors, the Cerenkov light images were classified as “acceptable” or higher for 90 percent of patients, says Magdalena Skubal, a cancer researcher at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center in New York City.</p>



<p><a>Cerenkov radiation is generated by high-speed particles </a><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/particle-detector-matter-subatomic-images-physics">traveling faster than light</a> through a material, such as bodily tissue (<em>SN: 8/5/21</em>). In Cerenkov luminescence imaging, or CLI, particles released by radiotracers cause the target tissue to vibrate and relax in a way that emits light, which is then captured by a camera.</p>





<p>Between May 2018 and March 2020, in the largest clinical trial of its kind to date, 96 participants underwent both CLI and standard imaging, such as positron emission tomography/computed tomography, or PET/CT. Participants with a variety of diagnoses, including lymphoma, thyroid cancer and metastatic prostate cancer, received one of five radiotracers and were then imaged by the prototype — a camera in a light-proof enclosure.</p>

<p>Skubal and colleagues found that CLI detected all radiotracers, suggesting that the technology is more versatile than PET/CT scans, which work with only some radiotracers.</p>



<p>CLI images aren’t as precise as those from PET/CT scans. But CLI could be used as an initial diagnostic test or to assess the general size of a tumor undergoing treatment, says study coauthor Edwin Pratt, also of Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center. “It would be a quick and easy way to see if there&#8217;s something off … [that warrants] further investigation,” Pratt says.<br><br>The findings strengthen the case for the technology as a promising low-cost alternative that could expand access to nuclear imaging in hospitals, says Antonello Spinelli, a preclinical imaging scientist at Experimental Imaging Centre in Milan, Italy, who was not involved in the research.<a href="https://sites.google.com/site/snstaffresources/resources/citation-styles"></a></p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/fast-radio-burst-planet-neutron-star-cosmic">Crumbling planets might trigger repeating fast radio bursts</a></h4>

              
                <p>Fragmenting planets sweeping extremely close to their stars might be the cause of mysterious cosmic blasts of radio waves.</p>



<p>Milliseconds-long fast radio bursts, or FRBs, erupt from distant cosmic locales. Some of these bursts blast only once and others repeat. A new computer calculation suggests the repetitive kind <a href="https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ac558f">could be due to a planet interacting with its magnetic host star</a>, researchers report in the March 20 <em>Astrophysical Journal</em>.</p>



<p>FRBs are relative newcomers to astronomical research. Ever since the first was discovered in 2007, researchers <a href="https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4365/ac33ab">have added hundreds</a> to the tally. Scientists have theorized dozens of ways the two different types of FRBs can occur, and nearly all theories include compact, magnetic stellar remnants known as neutron stars. Some ideas include powerful radio flares from magnetars, the <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/milky-way-flash-implicates-magnetars-source-fast-radio-bursts">most magnetic neutron stars imaginable</a> (<em>SN: 6/4/20</em>). Others suggest a <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/fast-radio-burst-source-star-cluster-old-globular">fast-spinning neutron star</a>, or even asteroids interacting with magnetars (<em>SN: 2/23/</em>22).</p>





<p>“How fast radio bursts are produced is still up for debate,” says astronomer Yong-Feng Huang of Nanjing University in China.</p>



<p>Huang and his colleagues considered a new way to make the repeating flares: interactions between a <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/new-evidence-planets-orbiting-pulsar">neutron star and an orbiting planet</a> (<em>SN: 3/5/94</em>). Such planets can get exceedingly close to these stars, so the team calculated what might happen to a planet in a highly elliptical orbit around a neutron star. When the planet swings very close to its star, the star’s gravity pulls more on the planet than when the planet is at its farthest orbital point, elongating and distorting it. This “tidal pull,” Huang says, will rip some small clumps off the planet. Each clump in the team’s calculation is just a few kilometers wide and maybe one-millionth the mass of the planet, he adds.</p>



<p>Then the fireworks start. Neutron stars spew a wind of radiation and particles, much like our own sun but more extreme. When one of these clumps passes through that stellar wind, the interaction “can produce really strong radio emissions,” Huang says. If that happens when the clump appears to pass in front of the star from Earth’s perspective, we might see it as a fast radio burst. Each burst in a repeating FRB signal could be caused by one of these clumps interacting with the neutron star’s wind during each close planet pass, he says. After that interaction, what remains of the clump drifts in orbit around the star, but away from Earth’s perspective, so we never see it again.</p>



<p>Comparing the calculated bursts to two known repeaters — <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/repeating-fast-radio-bursts-recorded-first-time">the first ever discovered</a>, which repeats roughly every 160 days, and a more recent discovery that repeats every 16 days, the team found the fragmenting planet scenario could explain how often the bursts happened and how bright they were (<em>SN: 3/2/16</em>).</p>



<p>The star’s strong gravitational “tidal” pull on the planet during each close pass might change the planet’s orbit over time, says astrophysicist Wenbin Lu of Princeton University, who was not involved in this study but who investigates possible FRB scenarios. “Every orbit, there is some energy loss from the system,” he says. “Due to tidal interactions between the planet and the star, the orbit very quickly shrinks.” So it’s possible that the orbit could shrink so fast that FRB signals wouldn’t last long enough for a chance detection, he says.</p>



<p>But the orbit change could also give astronomers a way to check this scenario as an FRB source. Observing repeating FRBs over several years to track any changes in the time between bursts could narrow down whether this hypothesis could explain the observations, Lu says. “That may be a good clue.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/egyptian-fruit-bat-echolocation-day-light-sound-vision">Most bats don’t echolocate in broad daylight. Here’s an exception</a></h4>

              
                <p>Despite their excellent vision, one city-dwelling colony of fruit bats echolocates during broad daylight — completely contrary to what experts expected.</p>



<p>A group of Egyptian fruit bats (<em>Rousettus aegyptiacus</em>) in downtown Tel Aviv uses sound to <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0960982222003906">navigate in the middle of the day</a>, researchers report in the April 11 <em>Current Biology</em>. The finding greatly extends the hours during which bats from this colony echolocate. A few years ago, some team members had noticed bats clicking while they flew under low-light conditions. The midday sound-off seems to help the bats forage and navigate, even though they can see just fine.</p>



<p>Bats that are active during the day are unusual. Out of the more than 1,400 species, roughly 10 are diurnal. What’s more, most diurnal bats don’t use echolocation during the day, relying instead on their vision to forage and avoid obstacles. They save echolocation for dim light or dark conditions.</p>





<p>So that’s why, two years ago, a group of Tel Aviv researchers were surprised when they noticed a bat smiling during the day. They were looking over photos from their latest study of Egyptian fruit bats when they noticed one with its mouth slightly parted and upturned.</p>



<p>“When an Egyptian fruit bat is smiling, he’s echolocating — he’s producing clicks with his tongue and his mouth is open,” says Ofri Eitan, a bat researcher at Tel Aviv University. “But this was during the day, and these bats see really well.”</p>



<p>When Eitan and his colleagues looked through other photos — thousands of them — many showed smiling bats in broad daylight. The team showed in 2015 that the diurnal Egyptian fruit bats <a href="https://www.cell.com/current-biology/fulltext/S0960-9822(15)01364-0">do use echolocation outdoors under various low light conditions</a>, at least occasionally. But the researchers hadn’t looked at whether the bats were echolocating during midday hours when light levels are highest.</p>



<p>The scientists began to wonder just how rare this behavior was. “We hypothesized that fruit bats would rarely use echolocation in broad daylight,” the team writes.</p>



<p>So, the researchers trained their video and acoustic recording equipment on their study colony, which roosts on the ceiling of a mall’s underground parking lot in central Tel Aviv. After recording roughly 500 flying bats, the researchers had to admit they were wrong. Just over 70 percent of the bats regularly used echolocation as they emerged from their colony.</p>



<p>“We were surprised to see that,” Eitan says. “OK, so the bats are echolocating. But is it functional?”</p>



<p>Next, the team looked at whether the bats used echolocation while foraging, flying near and landing on fruit trees, and approaching an artificial pool to drink. The researchers discovered all the bats echolocated — some even while they had large pieces of fruit in their mouths.</p>



<p>The bats also significantly increased their click rates before landing on a branch or approaching the pool. In other words, the bats were stepping up their game as they got closer to scary obstacles to avoid crashing into them or landing badly.</p>



<p>“We suggest that echolocation provides better distance estimation accuracy than vision and is thus advantageous when flying near obstacles such as trees or when descending to drink,” the researchers write.</p>



<p>The team’s previous research also shows that when the bats fly high above the ground where there are no obstacles, they hardly smile and click, suggesting that they can stop using their echolocation when it’s not useful.</p>



<p>Most bat experts believe these mammals became largely nocturnal to avoid visual predators such as birds of prey. But “observations such as this one tell us that echolocation must be so hard-wired in bats that it keeps being used even when their&nbsp;sensitive eyes would suffice,” says Danilo Russo, a bat researcher at the&nbsp;University of Naples Federico II in Italy who was not involved in the study. “This is especially interesting in the species covered in the study, which still&nbsp;largely relies on vision besides using echolocation.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coastal-cities-sinking-subsidence-rising-seas">Coastal cities around the globe are sinking</a></h4>

              
                <p>Coastal cities around the globe are sinking by up to several centimeters per year, on average, satellite observations reveal. <a href="https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1029/2022GL098477">The one-two punch of subsiding land and rising seas</a> means that these coastal regions are at greater risk for flooding than previously thought, researchers report in the April 16 <em>Geophysical Research Letters</em>.</p>



<p>Matt Wei, an earth scientist at the University of Rhode Island in Narragansett, and colleagues studied 99 coastal cities on six continents. “We tried to balance population and geographic location,” he says. While subsidence has been <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11069-011-9866-9">measured in cities previously</a>, earlier research has tended to focus on just one city or region. This investigation is different, Wei says. “It’s one of the first to really use data with global coverage.”</p>







<p>Wei and his team relied on observations made from 2015 to 2020 by <a href="https://sentinel.esa.int/web/sentinel/missions/sentinel-1">a pair of European satellites</a>. Instruments onboard beam microwave signals toward Earth and then record the waves that bounce back. By measuring the timing and intensity of those reflected waves, the team determined the height of the ground with millimeter accuracy. And because each satellite flies over the same part of the planet every 12 days, the researchers were able to trace how the ground deformed over time.</p>



<p>The largest subsidence rates — up to five centimeters per year —are mostly in Asian cities like Tianjin, China; Karachi, Pakistan; and Manila, Philippines, the team found. What’s more, one-third, or 33, of the analyzed cities are sinking in some places by more than a centimeter per year.</p>



<p>That’s a worrying trend, says Darío Solano-Rojas, an earth scientist at the National Autonomous University of Mexico in Mexico City who was not involved in the research. These cities are being hit with a double whammy: At the same time that <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/waters-rise-coastal-megacities-mumbai-face-catastrophe">sea levels are rising due to climate change</a>, the land is sinking (<em>SN: 8/15/18</em>). “Understanding that part of the problem is a big deal,” Solano-Rojas says.</p>



<div class="wp-block-sciencenews-content-sidebar">
<h3>Sinking cities</h3>



<p>Satellite measurements of ground height in and around coastal cities, obtained from 2015 to 2020, reveal how fast many are sinking. In parts of some cities, such as these four, the ground is subsiding by more than 10 millimeters per year. Negative values correspond to the ground sinking and moving away from a satellite, while positive ones correspond to the ground rising. The insets show satellite imagery of where subsidence is greatest, indicating that those areas are home to residential or industrial development. The magenta triangles and circles mark Global Navigation Satellite System stations used in the analysis.</p>

<p>Wei and his colleagues think that the subsidence is largely caused by people. When the researchers looked at Google Earth imagery of the regions within cities that were rapidly sinking, the team saw mostly residential or commercial areas. That’s a tip-off that the culprit is groundwater extraction, the team concluded. Landscapes tend to settle <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/spanish-quake-linked-groundwater-pumping">as water is pumped out of aquifers</a> (<em>SN: 10/22/12</em>).</p>



<p>But there’s reason to be hopeful. In the past, cities such as Shanghai and Indonesia’s Jakarta were sinking by more than 10 centimeters per year, on average. But now subsidence in those places has slowed, possibly due to recent <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1755-6724.14403">governmental regulations</a> limiting groundwater extraction.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/giant-planet-newly-discovered-gas-dust-formation">A newly discovered planet renews debate about how some giant worlds form</a></h4>

              
                <p>A young, massive planet is orbiting in an unusual place in its star system, and it’s leading researchers to revive a long-debated view of how giant planets can form.</p>



<p>The protoplanet, nine times the mass of Jupiter, is too far away from its star to have formed by accreting matter piece by piece, images suggest. Instead, <a href="blank">the massive world probably formed all at once</a> in a violent implosion of gas and dust, <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41550-022-01634-x">researchers report April 4 in </a><a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41550-022-01634-x"><em>Nature Astronomy</em></a>.</p>



<p>“My first reaction was, there’s no way this can be true,” says Thayne Currie, an astrophysicist at the Subaru Telescope headquartered in Hilo, Hawaii.</p>





<p>For years, astronomers have debated <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/newfound-planet-stirs-old-debate">the ways in which giant planets might form</a> (<em>SN: 12/3/10</em>).&nbsp; In the “core accretion” story, a planet starts out as small bits of matter within a disk of gas, dust and ice swirling around a young star. The clumps continue to accrete other matter, growing to become the core of the planet. Out past a certain distance from the star, that core then accumulates a thick blanket of hydrogen and helium, turning it into a bloated, gassy world.</p>



<p>But the new planet, orbiting a star called AB Aurigae, is in the outskirts of its system, where there’s less matter to gather into a core. In this position, the core can’t become massive enough to create its gaseous envelope. The planet’s remote location, Currie and colleagues argue, makes it more likely to form via “disk instability,” where the disk around the star breaks into planet-sized fragments. The fragments then rapidly collapse in on themselves, drawn together by their own gravity, and clump together, forming a giant planet.</p>





<p>Using the Subaru Telescope atop Mauna Kea, Currie and colleagues observed AB Aurigae periodically from 2016 to 2020. NASA’s Hubble Space Telescope also observed the star repeatedly over 13 years. Looking at all these images, the team saw a bright spot next to the star. The bright clump was a clear protoplanet, named AB Aur b, orbiting nearly 14 billion kilometers from its star — roughly 3 times as far as Neptune is from the sun.</p>



<p>In the images, AB Aur b looked like it was straight out of a simulation of planet formation by disk instability, Currie says. Except it was real.</p>

<p>“For the longest time, I never believed that planet formation by disk instability could actually work,” he says.</p>



<p>Because AB Aur b is still growing, embedded in the young star’s disk, it could help to explain how the handful of known massive planets orbiting far from their stars formed.</p>



<p>“We only know maybe a few dozen total of these types of planets,” says Quinn Konopacky, an astrophysicist at the University of California, San Diego who was not involved in the research. “Every single one that we find is basically precious.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>It’s difficult to distinguish whether a planet formed by core accretion or disk instability through observations alone, Konopacky says. The fact that AB Aur b is at such a wide separation from its star is “good evidence” that disk instability is what’s happening, she says. Still, “I think that there’s a lot more work to be done and other ways that we can try to assess if that’s what’s going on in the system.”</p>



<p>Both Konopacky and Currie say this research represents <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/astronomers-snap-first-baby-pictures-planet">only the second direct observation of a protoplanet</a> (<em>SN: 7/2/18</em>). Oftentimes, researchers have trouble distinguishing an actual forming planet from a planetary disk.</p>



<p>The recently launched <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/james-webb-space-telescope-l2-lagrange-point">James Webb Space Telescope</a> could help researchers understand these anomalous gas giants very distant from their stars by studying the AB Aurigae system and others like it, Currie says (<em>SN: 1/24/22</em>). “I think this will spur a lot of debates and follow-up studies by other researchers.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/maya-calendar-hieroglyph-date-oldest-evidence">This hieroglyph is the oldest known record of the Maya calendar</a></h4>

              
                <p>Buried within the Las Pinturas pyramid in San Bartolo, Guatemala, thousands of painted plaster mural fragments offer a window into ancient Maya civilization. Two of those fragments form the earliest known record of a Maya calendar, created between 300 and 200 B.C.</p>



<p>The fragments <a href="http://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.abl9290">depict the date of “7 Deer”</a> from the 260-day sacred calendar common across ancient Mesoamerica and still used today by indigenous communities in Guatemala and southern Mexico, archaeologist David Stuart and colleagues report April 13 in <em>Science Advances</em>. The calendar system’s longevity attests to the persistence of Maya intellectual culture, says Stuart, of the University of Texas at Austin.</p>



<p>From 400 B.C. to 100 A.D., Mayas razed and rebuilt the pyramid seven times, creating a series of discrete time capsules stacked on top of each other, says study coauthor Heather Hurst, project director of the San Bartolo-Xultun Regional Archaeological Project. By radiocarbon dating both the material in the layer where the calendar fragments were found and the material used to bury that layer, researchers determined a narrow time window in which the 7 Deer day record would have been produced.</p>

<p>After two decades of excavation, the site continues to be an important source of ancient Maya artifacts. The <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/getting-read-early-maya-writing">earliest known Maya writing</a>, also dated to between 300 and 200 B.C., was found in the same time capsule as the 7 Deer day record (<em>SN: 1/17/06</em>).</p>



<p>The 260-day calendar system “survived not only close to 1,800 years in the Maya world before the Spanish showed up, but it persisted even more recently, since conquests . . . in some of the most oppressed areas,” Stuart says. “I find that an incredible thing.”</p>



<p>In fact, the intricacy of the depiction suggests that the calendar system had already existed for centuries by the time it was drawn, says Stephen Houston, an archaeologist at Brown University in Providence, R.I., who was not involved in the study. The characters are “very well practiced. This isn’t a stumbling baby step.”</p>



<p>Ten other fragments described in the study feature different styles of handwriting that indicate multiple scribes worked on the murals. This suggests that the Maya literary tradition was already robust by this time, Houston says. “There’s a density of knowledge here.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/comet-biggest-nucleus-solar-system-bernardinelli-bernstein">This is the biggest known comet in our solar system</a></h4>

              
                <p>The nucleus of a comet discovered in 2014 is the largest ever spotted.</p>



<p>The “dirty snowball” at the center of comet C/2014 UN271 is about 120 kilometers across, researchers report in the April 10 <em>Astrophysical Journal Letters</em>. That makes <a href="https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/2041-8213/ac626a">this comet</a> — also known as Bernardinelli-Bernstein, after its discoverers — about twice as wide as Rhode Island, says David Jewitt, an astronomer at UCLA.</p>



<p>Though the comet is big — and vastly larger than <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/comets-spewing-oxygen-club-gets-new-member">Halley’s comet</a>, which measures a little more than 11 kilometers across — it will never be visible to the naked eye from Earth because it’s too far away, Jewitt says (<em>SN: 12/14/15</em>). The object is now about 3 billion kilometers from Earth. At its closest approach in 2031, the comet will come no closer to the sun than 1.6 billion kilometers, about the same distance as Saturn.</p>

<p>Jewitt and colleagues sized up the comet with the help of new images from the Hubble Space Telescope, combined with images taken by another team at far-infrared wavelengths. The analysis also revealed that the comet’s nucleus reflects only about 3 percent of the light that strikes it. That makes the object “blacker than coal,” Jewitt says.</p>



<p>Comet Bernardinelli-Bernstein takes about 3 million years to circle the sun in a highly elliptical orbit. At its farthest, the comet may reach about half a light-year from the sun — about one-eighth of the distance to the next nearest star.</p>



<p>The comet is likely “just the tip of the iceberg” as far as undiscovered comets of this size go, Jewitt says. And for every comet this size, he suggests, there could be tens of thousands of smaller objects circling the sun undetected.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/climate-change-human-evolution-habitat-migration">How ancient, recurring climate changes may have shaped human evolution</a></h4>

              
                <p>Recurring climate changes may have orchestrated where <em>Homo</em> species lived over the last 2 million years and how humankind evolved.</p>



<p>Ups and downs in temperature, rainfall and plant growth promoted ancient hominid migrations within and out of Africa that fostered an ability to survive in unfamiliar environments, say climate physicist and oceanographer Axel Timmermann and colleagues. Based on how the timing of ancient climate variations matched up with the comings and goings of different fossil <em>Homo</em> species, the researchers generated a novel — and controversial — <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-022-04600-9">outline of human evolution</a>. Timmermann, of Pusan National University in Busan, South Korea, and his team present that scenario April 13 in <em>Nature</em>.</p>



<p>Here’s how these scientists tell the story of humankind, starting roughly 2 million years ago. By that time, <em>Homo erectus</em> had already begun to roam outside Africa, while an East African species called <em>H. ergaster</em> stuck close to its home region. <em>H. ergaster</em> probably evolved into a disputed East African species called <em>H. heidelbergensis, </em>which split into southern and northern branches between 850,000 and 600,000 years ago. These migrations coincided with warmer, survival-enhancing climate shifts that occur every 20,000 to 100,000 years due to variations in Earth’s orbit and tilt that modify how much sunlight reaches the planet.</p>





<p>Then, after traveling north to Eurasia, <em>H. heidelbergensis</em> possibly gave rise to Denisovans around 430,000 years ago, the researchers say. And in central Europe, harsh habitats created by recurring ice ages spurred the evolution of <em>H. heidelbergensis</em> into Neandertals between 400,000 and 300,000 years ago. Finally, in southern Africa between 310,000 and 200,000 years ago, increasingly harsh environmental conditions accompanied a transition from <em>H. heidelbergensis</em> to <em>H. sapiens</em>, who later moved out of Africa.</p>



<p>But some researchers contend that <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/evan.21929"><em>H. heidelbergensis, </em>as defined by its advocates, </a>contains too many hard-to-categorize fossils to qualify as a species.</p>



<p>An alternative view to the newly proposed scenario suggests that, during the time that <em>H. heidelbergensis </em>allegedly lived, closely related <em>Homo</em> populations <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/human-evolution-mating-2021-research">periodically split up, reorganized and bred with outsiders</a>, without necessarily operating as distinct biological species <em>(SN: 12/13/21</em>). In this view, mating among <em>H. sapiens</em> groups across Africa starting as early as 500,000 years ago eventually produced a physical makeup typical of people today. If so, that would undermine the validity of a neatly branching evolutionary tree of <em>Homo</em> species leading up to <em>H. sapiens</em>, as proposed by Timmermann’s group.</p>



<p>The new scenario derives from a computer simulation of the probable climate over the last 2 million years, in 1,000-year intervals, across Africa, Asia and Europe. The researchers then examined the relationship between simulated predictions of what ancient habitats were like in those regions and the dates of known hominid fossil and archaeological sites. Those sites range in age from around 2 million to 30,000 years old.</p>



<p>Previous fossil evidence indicates that <em>H. erectus </em><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/homo-erectus-last-known-appearance-roughly-117000-years-ago">spread as far as East Asia and Java</a> (<em>SN: 12/18/19</em>). Timmermann’s climate simulations suggest that <em>H. erectus</em>, as well as <em>H. heidelbergensis</em> and <em>H. sapiens</em>, adapted to increasingly diverse habitats during extended travels. Those migrations stimulated brain growth and cultural innovations that “may have made [all three species] the global wanderers that they were,” Timmermann says.</p>



<p>The new habitat simulations also indicate that <em>H. sapiens</em> was particularly good at adjusting to hot, dry regions, such as northeastern Africa and the Arabian Peninsula.</p>



<p>Climate, habitat and fossil data weren’t sufficient to include additional proposed <em>Homo</em> species in the new evolutionary model, including <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/hobbits-died-out-earlier-thought"><em>H. floresiensis</em> in Indonesia</a> (<em>SN: 3/30/16</em>) and <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/homo-naledi-may-have-lived-around-same-time-early-humans"><em>H.</em></a> <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/homo-naledi-may-have-lived-around-same-time-early-humans"><em>naledi</em> in South Africa</a> (<em>SN: 5/9/17</em>).</p>



<p>It has <a href="https://www.cell.com/trends/ecology-evolution/pdf/S0169-5347(21)00125-7.pdf">proven difficult</a> to show more definitively that ancient environmental changes caused transitions in hominid evolution. For instance, a previous proposal that abrupt climate shifts resulted in rainy, resource-rich stretches of southern Africa’s coast, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/stone-age-culture-africa-inland-coasts-crystals-tools">creating conditions where <em>H. sapiens </em>then evolved</a> (<em>SN: 3/31/21</em>), still lacks sufficient climate, fossil and other archaeological evidence.</p>



<p>Paleoanthropologist Rick Potts of the Smithsonian Institution in Washington, D.C., has developed another influential theory about how climate fluctuations influenced human evolution that’s still open to debate. A series of <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/environmental-changes-stone-age-humans-adaptable">climate-driven booms and busts in resource availability</a>, starting around 400,000 years ago in East Africa, resulted in <em>H. sapiens </em>evolving as a species with a keen ability to survive in unpredictably shifting environments, Potts argues (<em>SN: 10/21/20</em>). But the new model indicates that ancient <em>H. sapiens</em> often migrated into novel but relatively stable environments, Timmermann says, undermining support for Potts’ hypothesis, known as variability selection.</p>



<p>The new findings need to be compared with long-term environmental records at several well-studied fossil sites in Africa and East Asia before rendering a verdict on variability selection, Potts says.</p>



<p>The new model “provides a great framework” to evaluate ideas such as variability selection, says paleoclimatologist Rachel Lupien of Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory in Palisades, N.Y. That’s especially true, Lupien says, if researchers can specify whether climate and ecosystem changes that played out over tens or hundreds of years were closely linked to ancient <em>Homo</em> migrations.</p>



<p>For now, much remains obscured on the ancient landscape of human evolution.</p>

                <p><em>By</em> <a href="https://twitter.com/mattbwarren">Matthew Warren</a></p>



<p>The next decade promises to be an exciting one for space travel. With the <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/specials/artemis/">Artemis missions</a>, NASA plans to send a crewed mission to the moon in a few years’ time, and will eventually establish a base camp at the lunar South Pole for longer expeditions. Meanwhile, <a href="https://www.npr.org/2022/03/17/1087167893/elon-musk-mars-2029">Elon Musk claims</a> that SpaceX will send a crew to Mars in 2029.</p>



<p>But any long-term space mission will face numerous challenges — not just technical, but also psychological. Astronauts will have to spend weeks or months in small confines with just a few fellow crew members, isolated from the rest of humanity. So it will be important to predict how this experience might affect astronauts’ mental health — and whether there are particular activities that could protect against any negative effects.</p>



<span id="more-45982"></span>



<p>This was one of the aims of the <a href="https://saga.dk/projects/lunark/expedition">LUNARK project</a>, the results of which were <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0094576522001059?via%3Dihub">published recently</a> in <em>Acta Astronautica</em>. Two men in their 20s spent 61 days living in a specially constructed habitat in Northern Greenland, designed to mimic the conditions astronauts would experience in a base on the moon. The participants had to cope with outside temperatures as low as -30°c and a month of complete darkness, and had no contact with the outside world other than sending short daily messages back home.</p>



<p>Each day, the participants had tasks to complete such as conducting experiments or gathering ice for water, but also had downtime to relax or socialise together. And at the end of most days, they filled in questionnaires about how they were feeling. These asked about negative emotions they might have experienced, how much they desired social contact, how lonely they felt, whether they felt time was passing faster or slower than normal, and the extent to which they experienced “resignation” (this includes feelings of detachment and helplessness). &nbsp;The two “astronauts” also reported on the time spent performing various kinds of activities that day, such as chatting, sleeping, eating, writing, and watching TV shows.</p>



<p>It was the results of these surveys that Paolo Riva from the University of Milano-Bicocca and team were interested in. In their new paper, the researchers report that both participants displayed an increased desire for social contact as the mission progressed, though they didn’t show any increase in negative emotions or feelings of resignation. Past work has found that isolation and ostracism can lead to the experience of resignation, but the team suggests that this didn’t occur on the mission because the participants had willingly put themselves into this position. However, the team did find that feelings of resignation on one day were associated with feelings of resignation the next, suggesting these feelings can have a lingering effect — which could make them harder to counter when they do occur.</p>



<p>Certain activities seemed to mitigate negative emotional experiences. More time spent talking to the other participant about personal matters or taking part in leisure activities was related to reduced feelings of resignation. Leisure activities also made it feel like time was running faster. Talking about personal matters and exercising both also fostered a desire for social contact (a need which could be challenging to fulfil in extreme isolation, but which is presumably better than social withdrawal).   </p>



<p>The researchers conclude astronauts might not experience the same negative consequences as those who are in prison, say, or who have been socially excluded. That’s because they willingly sign up for space missions, and have a clear end date for their expeditions. But there is still clearly the potential for negative psychological effects, and their study suggests some ways to counteract these. In particular, physical exercise, leisure activities, and chatting with each other about matters unrelated to the mission all seem to promote wellbeing.</p>



<p>It’s interesting that the two participants had quite different emotional experiences: one generally reported more negative feelings than the other, for example, and felt that time was going slower than normal while the other felt it was going faster. This gets to a key limitation of the study: this is ultimately an experiment with a sample size of just two people, which really limits the generalisability of the findings. It’s also worth pointing out that the participants had known each other for a long time (in fact, they were co-founders of the company that made the habitat), so their experience might not be reflected in pairs or groups of people with different social dynamics.</p>



<p>Still, it’s a fascinating set-up for a psychology study — and until we get the chance to study astronauts on the moon, this is the perhaps next best thing.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2022/04/partnering-with-cruk/">Partnering with CRUK to improve quality and reproducibility in cancer research through preregistration</a></h4>

              
                <p>This year, two Cancer Research UK (CRUK) award programs include a little something extra in their spring grant cycles. The funder has <a href="https://www.cancerresearchuk.org/funding-for-researchers/how-we-deliver-research/positive-research-culture/registered-reports">partnered</a> with a consortium of 13 journals publishing preregistered research, including <em>PLOS Biology</em> and <em>PLOS ONE</em>, to help grantees submit and receive a publication decision earlier in the process.</p>



<h2>What&rsquo;s preregistration?</h2>



<p>Preregistration is the practice of depositing a study design with a repository (and, optionally, submitting it for peer review at a journal) <em>before </em>experimentation and data collection begin. Journal peer review focuses on the importance of the research question and the rigor of the methodology and analytical approach with the goal of producing the strongest possible work. Successful submissions receive a provisional acceptance promising to publish the resulting research article when the investigation is completed whatever the results, provided the authors adhere to their study design.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The benefits of preregistration for the scientific system in general are potentially enormous, and include:&nbsp;</p>



<ul><li>improvements in study design, since review takes place early in the research lifecycle, when the plan can be modified</li><li>more rigorous research</li><li>reduced bias in reporting and editorial decision-making</li><li>increased efficiency, and&nbsp;</li><li>a more complete scientific record that includes negative and null results as a matter of course</li></ul>



<p>For individual authors, preregistration provides a faster, more streamlined review process, with a virtual guarantee of future publication&mdash;as well as acknowledgement of a vital part of the research process that often goes unnoticed.</p>



<h2>How does the preregistered research funding partnership work?</h2>



<p>Now, when cancer researchers receive a project award from CRUK in either the early detection and diagnosis or prevention and population research programs, they&rsquo;ll also be able to opt-in receive a list of participating journals where they can submit a study design that arises from their funded awards for consideration. With the consent of the reviewers, CRUK will provide the authors&rsquo; chosen journal with names and contact details of the grant reviewers, to help ensure a smooth and efficient review. Being familiar with the work, the grant reviewers are likely to have constructive feedback beyond what was provided during the funding review. For authors based at many UK institutions, the cost of publication may be covered through a PLOS <a href="https://plos.org/resources/for-institutions/institutional-account-participants/">institutional partnership</a>.</p>



<h2>Preregistered publication options at PLOS</h2>



<p><em>PLOS Biology</em> and <em>PLOS ONE</em> both publish preregistered research, but each journal takes a slightly different approach. Learn which is right for your study.</p>



<ul><li>At <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/s/what-we-publish#loc-registered-reports"><em>PLOS ONE</em></a>, editorial assessment takes place in two phases, and results in <strong>two linked publications</strong>, each with its own DOI: a Registered Report Protocol, consisting of study design, rationale, timeline, proposed methodology for data collection and analysis; and a Registered Report, describing the completed research investigation and results.</li></ul>



<ul><li><a href="https://plos-marketing.s3.amazonaws.com/Marketing/Biology+Preregistered+Articles+Guidelines+for+Authors.pdf"><em>PLOS Biology</em></a> also conducts peer review in two stages, but publishes<strong> a single Preregistered Research Article</strong>, once the work has been fully completed. Authors submit a Stage 1 protocol including the hypothesis, methodology materials and methods sections. Once the study concludes, the authors add the results and discussion to their approved Stage 1 protocol to create a single, integrated Preregistered Research Article.</li></ul>



<h2>Getting started</h2>



<p>Researchers based in the UK can submit applications for the <a href="https://www.cancerresearchuk.org/funding-for-researchers/our-funding-schemes/early-detection-and-diagnosis-project-award">Early Detection and Diagnosis Project Award</a> or the <a href="https://www.cancerresearchuk.org/funding-for-researchers/our-funding-schemes/prevention-and-population-research-project-awards">Prevention and Population Research Project Award</a> through June 2022. Researchers working in any field within journal scope are welcome to submit preregistered research directly to <em>PLOS Biology</em> or <em>PLOS ONE</em> at any time.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/soil-erosion-rate-us-midwest-unsustainable-usda">More than 57 billion tons of soil have eroded in the U.S. Midwest</a></h4>

              
                <p>With soils rich for cultivation, most land in the Midwestern United States has been converted from tallgrass prairie to agricultural fields. Less than 0.1 percent of the original prairie remains.</p>



<p>This shift over the last 160 years has resulted in <a href="https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1029/2021EF002396">staggering — and unsustainable — soil erosion rates</a> for the region, researchers report in the March <em>Earth’s Future</em>. The erosion is estimated to be double the rate that the U.S. Department of Agriculture says is sustainable. If it continues unabated, it could significantly limit future crop production, the scientists say.</p>



<p>In the new study, the team focused on erosional escarpments — tiny cliffs formed through erosion — lying at boundaries between <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/prairie-tales">prairie and agricultural fields</a> (<em>SN: 1/20/96</em>). “These rare prairie remnants that are scattered across the Midwest are sort of a preservation of the pre-European-American settlement land surface,” says Isaac Larsen, a geologist at the University of Massachusetts Amherst.</p>





<p>At 20 sites in nine Midwestern states, with most sites located in Iowa, Larsen and colleagues used a specialized GPS system to survey the altitude of the prairie and farm fields. That GPS system “tells you where you are within about a centimeter on Earth’s surface,” Larsen says. This enables the researchers to detect even small differences between the height of the prairie and the farmland.</p>



<p>At each site, the researchers took these measurements at 10 or more spots. The team then measured erosion by comparing the elevation differences of the farmed and prairie land. The researchers found that the agricultural fields were 0.37 meters below the prairie areas, on average.</p>

<p>This corresponds to the loss of roughly 1.9 millimeters of soil per year from agricultural fields since the estimated start of traditional farming at these sites more than a century and a half ago, the researchers calculate. That rate is nearly double the maximum of one millimeter per year that the USDA considers sustainable for these locations. &nbsp;</p>



<p>There are two main ways that the USDA currently estimates the erosion rate in the region. One way estimates the rate to be about one-third of that reported by the researchers. The other estimates the rate to be just one-eighth of the researchers’ rate. Those USDA estimates do not include tillage, a conventional farming process in which machinery is used to turn the soil and prepare it for planting. By <a href="https://crops.extension.iastate.edu/encyclopedia/frequent-tillage-and-its-impact-soil-quality">disrupting the soil structure</a>, tilling increases surface runoff and erosion due to soil moving downslope.</p>



<p>Larsen and colleagues say that they would like to see tillage incorporated into the USDA’s erosion estimates. Then, the USDA numbers might better align with the whopping 57.6 billion metric tons of soil that the researchers estimate has been lost across the entire region in the last 160 years.</p>



<p>This massive “soil loss is already causing food production to decline,” Larsen says. As soil thickness decreases, the <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Mahdi-Al-Kaisi/publication/265410087_Soil_Erosion_Crop_Productivity_and_Cultural_Practices/links/549821df0cf2c5a7e3429cca/Soil-Erosion-Crop-Productivity-and-Cultural-Practices.pdf">amount of corn successfully grown in Iowa is reduced</a>, research shows. And disruption to the food supply could continue or worsen if the estimated rate of erosion persists.</p>



<p>Not everyone is convinced that the average amount of soil lost each year has remained steady since farming in the region started. Much of the erosion that the researchers measured could have been caused in the earlier histories of these sites, dating back to when farmers “began to break prairies and/or forests and clear things,” says agronomist Michael Kucera.</p>



<p>Perhaps current erosion rates have slowed, says Kucera, who is the steward of the National Erosion Database at the USDA’s National Soil Survey Center in Lincoln, Neb.</p>





<p>To help reduce future erosion, farmers can use no-till farming and plant cover crops, the researchers note. By planting cover crops during off-seasons, farmers reduce the amount of time the soil is bare, making it less vulnerable to wind and water erosion.</p>



<p>In the United States, no-till and similar practices to help limit erosion have been implemented at least sometimes by&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ers.usda.gov/amber-waves/2019/march/no-till-and-strip-till-are-widely-adopted-but-often-used-in-rotation-with-other-tillage-practices/">51 percent of corn, cotton, soybean and wheat&nbsp;farmers</a>, according to the USDA.&nbsp;But cover crops are only used in about 5 percent of cases where they could be, says Bruno Basso, a sustainable agriculture researcher at Michigan State University in East Lansing who wasn’t involved with the study. “It costs $40 to $50 per acre to plant a cover crop,” he says. Though some government grant funding is available, “the costs of cover crops are not supported,” and there is a need for additional incentives, he says.</p>



<p>To implement no-till strategies, “the farmer has to be a better manager,” says Keith Berns, a farmer who co-owns and operates Green Cover Seed, which is headquartered in Bladen, Neb. His company provides cover crop seeds and custom seed mixtures. He has also been using no-till practices for decades.</p>



<p>To succeed, farmers must decide what particular cover crops are most suitable for their land, <a href="https://www.canr.msu.edu/resources/killing-cover-crops-in-urban-farms-and-gardens#:~:text=Kill%20cover%20crops%20shortly%20after,crops%2C%20like%20lettuce%20and%20carrots.">when to grow them and when to kill them</a>. Following these regimens, which can be more complicated than traditional farming, can be “difficult to do on large scales,” Berns says.</p>



<p>Cover crops can <a href="https://www.sare.org/wp-content/uploads/Cover-Crop-Economics.pdf">confer benefits</a> such as helping farmers repair erosion and control weeds within the first year of planting. But it can take multiple years for the crops’ financial benefits to exceed their cost. Some farmers don’t even own the land they work, making it even less lucrative for them to invest in cover crops, Berns notes.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Building soil health can take half a decade, Basso says. “Agriculture is really always facing this dilemma [of] short-sighted, economically driven decisions versus longer-term sustainability of the whole enterprise.”</p>

<p><a href="https://bookshop.org/a/21798/9780593318430">Paradise Falls</a><br><em>Keith O’Brien</em><br><em>Pantheon, $30</em></p>



<p>In December 1987, my family moved from sweltering Florida to a snow-crusted island in the Niagara River just north of Buffalo, N.Y. There on Grand Island, I heard for the first time about a place called Love Canal. Right across the river, not a mile away, lay an entire neighborhood that had been emptied out less than a decade before by one of the worst environmental disasters in American history.</p>





<p>In the 1940s and ’50s, Hooker Chemical dumped about 20,000 tons of toxic waste into the canal, eventually covering it with soil and selling the land to the city of Niagara Falls for a dollar. The city built a school on it, and houses sprang up around it. For years, residents would smell strange odors in their homes, and kids would see chemicals bubbling up on the playground, but it wasn’t until the late 1970s that local officials began to take notice. Eventually, testing revealed dangerous levels of toxic chemicals along with <a href="https://www.health.ny.gov/environmental/investigations/love_canal/cancer_study_community_report.htm">increased rates of certain cancers in adults</a>, as well as seizures, learning disabilities and kidney problems in children.</p>



<p>To me as a kid, the area surrounding Love Canal was an eerie abandoned neighborhood where teenagers would drive around at night to get creeped out. The place is truly haunting. The stories I heard of toxic chemicals gurgling up in people’s backyards stayed with me, and in 2008, I returned as an environmental reporter to write about Love Canal’s legacy. Only then did I understand the magnitude of the crisis.</p>



<p>And only now, with the publication of <em>Paradise Falls</em>, do I fully comprehend the human tragedy of Love Canal and the neighborhood called LaSalle that straddled it. Journalist Keith O’Brien chronicles events primarily through the lens of the people who lived there. He focuses on the period from Christmas 1976 to May 1980, when President Jimmy Carter signed a federal emergency order that evacuated more than 700 families.</p>





<p>Having covered the story myself, I was puzzled at first to see that O’Brien covered such a tight time frame in a story that developed over decades. He skims quickly through the history of chemical dumping and touches only briefly on follow-up studies of residents in the 1980s. But he fills more than 350 pages with a narrative of the main crisis period so gripping it could almost be a thriller. As the disaster unfolds, there are horrific discoveries, medical mysteries and plenty of screaming neighbors. The whole narrative is pulled directly from O’Brien’s extensive research, including interviews and documents that had been stored for decades.</p>



<p>Chapters hop between the perspectives of key residents and the scientists and officials dealing with the crisis, but the story is told chronologically and in great detail. In fact, there’s so much detail that we even learn the type of cookies (oatmeal) served to the officials from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency who housewife-turned-activist Lois Gibbs famously took hostage in a publicity stunt.</p>



<p>O’Brien’s previous book, <em>Fly Girls</em>, was about pioneering female aviators of the 1920s and ’30s. So perhaps it’s no surprise that he has again focused on heroines. Gibbs was the public face of Love Canal, but many of the other women who took action got far less attention. O’Brien brings their stories to light. There was Elene Thornton, a Black resident of public housing who fought for her neighbors; Bonnie Casper, a young congressional aide who rallied government action; and Beverly Paigen, a scientist who risked her job studying a problem her superiors wanted to drop.</p>



<p>But perhaps the most poignant story, told in heartbreaking detail, is that of Luella Kenny. She was a cancer researcher living with her family in a house that backed up to a creek near Love Canal when her 6-year-old son Jon Allen fell ill with mysterious symptoms. Doctors ignored her at first, but eventually the child grew so sick he was hospitalized with a kidney disease called nephrotic syndrome.</p>



<p>O’Brien narrates the family’s days with stunning clarity, capturing small but moving moments like Jon Allen gathering fallen chestnuts in the hospital parking lot and rolling them between his small, swollen fingers. By the time I read of Jon Allen’s death, even though I already knew the outcome, I cried. I felt as if I knew these people personally by the end of the book, and any misgivings I had initially about O’Brien’s approach disappeared. There are many ways to tell a story, but sometimes the simplest way — the perspective of those who lived it — is best. </p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/ukraine-identity-nationalism-independence-putin-russia">Ukrainian identity solidified for 30 years. Putin ignored the science</a></h4>

              
                <p>Before Russia invaded Ukraine, many military analysts feared that the capital of Kyiv would fall within days of an attack, undermining any further resistance. Instead, the war is well into its second month. Ukrainian fighters have reversed some Russian gains, forcing a retreat from Kyiv and an apparent narrowing of Russia’s sights to the country’s eastern provinces, closest to Russia’s border.</p>



<p>What these analysts and Russian President Vladimir Putin himself missed, social scientists say, is research showing that people who live within the borders of Ukraine have identified more and more as Ukrainian — and less as Russian — since Ukraine’s independence from the former Soviet Union in 1991.</p>



<p>That trend intensified after Russia seized the Crimean Peninsula in 2014 and started backing separatists in the Donbas region, political and ethnic studies scholar Volodymyr Kulyk said in a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRDGJiobv2g">virtual talk</a> organized by Harvard University in February. “<em>Russians</em> came to mean people in Russia,” said Kulyk, of the National Academy of Sciences of Ukraine in Kyiv.</p>





<p>These Ukrainian loyalists are now fighting tooth and nail for their country’s continued, sovereign existence.</p>



<p>“Putin underestimated Ukrainians’ attachment to their country and overestimated [their] connection to Russia,” says political scientist Lowell Barrington of Marquette University in Milwaukee. “One of his biggest mistakes was not reading social science research on Ukraine.”</p>



<h4>Historic divide</h4>



<p>The common refrain is that Ukraine is <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/1060586X.2018.1452247">a country divided along both linguistic and regional lines</a>, political scientists Olga Onuch of the University of Manchester in England and Henry Hale wrote in 2018 in <em>Post-Soviet Affairs</em>.</p>



<p>While the official language of Ukraine is Ukrainian, most people speak both Ukrainian and Russian. People living in western cities, most notably Lviv, primarily speak Ukrainian and those in eastern cities closer to the Russian border primarily speak Russian.</p>



<p>The origins of those divisions are complicated, but can be traced back, in part, to between the late 18th century and early 20th century when western Ukraine was part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire and eastern Ukraine was part of the Russian Empire. Then, after the collapse of the Russian Empire in 1917, Ukraine was briefly an independent state known as the Ukrainian People’s Republic before being incorporated into the Soviet Union in the early 1920s.</p>

<p>Putin seems to believe that national identities stay relatively fixed across time, says Hale, of George Washington University in Washington, D.C. Social scientists refer to that idea as primordialism, the belief that individuals have a single nationalistic or ethnic identity that they pass on to subsequent generations. In other words, once a Russian, always a Russian.</p>



<p>That rigid mentality shows up in official documents and censuses conducted in the Soviet Union starting in 1932. That’s when government officials began recording every citizen’s <em>natsionalnist, </em>essentially a conflation of nationality with ethnicity. People in the Soviet Union fell into one of over 180 possible ethnic categories, such as Russian, Chechen, Tatar, Jewish or Ukrainian, political scientists Oksana Mikheieva and Oxana Shevel wrote in 2021 in a chapter of the book <em><a href="https://www.ibidem.eu/en/from-the-ukraine-to-ukraine-9783838215143.html">From ‘the Ukraine’ to Ukraine</a>.</em> &nbsp;</p>



<p>“Nationality was transformed into a characteristic of a person that was inherited from his parents, rather than chosen consciously,” says Mikheieva, a political scientist at the European University Viadrina in Frankfurt and the Ukrainian Catholic University in Lviv.</p>



<p>While the Kremlin’s goal was to unite people of different nationalities under a single Soviet label, those with a Russian ethnicity remained at the top of the social ladder, write Mikheieva and Shevel, of Tufts University in Medford, Mass . Paradoxically, one’s nationality both provided a sense of belonging and deepened ethnic divides. &nbsp;</p>



<p>Putin, who served in the Soviet-era KGB, may have either directly or indirectly been counting on people to still view their nationality in this way. “He’s stuck in his formative years from the Soviet period,” says Elise Giuliano, a political scientist at Columbia University.</p>



<h4>Shifting identity</h4>



<p>Today, primordialism has largely fallen out of favor among social scientists, Hale says. Most researchers now see ethnic and nationalistic identities as fluid, evolving and dependent on the political and social environment. Individuals may also consider themselves to have multiple ethnicities. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Some of that shift in thinking comes from the study of Ukraine itself. The country’s relatively recent independence in 1991 means that social scientists can track the Ukrainian people’s evolving sense of identity in real time. And Ukraine also made the unusual move of granting citizenship to nearly everyone living within its territorial borders at the time of independence. When Ukrainian passports became available in 1992, officials likewise stopped the Soviet practice of stamping them with the owner’s <em>natsionalnist</em>. During the 2000s, that category also disappeared from birth certificates.</p>



<p>These practices contrasted with countries such as Latvia and Estonia, which refused automatic citizenship to ethnic Russians in their countries, says Barrington, the Marquette political scientist. Consequently, Ukraine paved the way for the emergence of a civic, or chosen, identity.</p>



<p>In studying post-Soviet Ukraine, researchers wanted to know: Would people living in Ukraine, even those with non-Ukrainian <em>natsionalnists,</em> shed their Soviet identity and become Ukrainian?&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>



<p>Official censuses conducted before and after independence hinted that the percentage of people living in Ukraine and identifying as Ukrainian did increase after 1991. In 1989, about 22 percent of people identified as Russian, but by 2001, only about 17 percent did. Migration out of Ukraine cannot fully account for that change, researchers say.<br><br>Since 2001, no national censuses have been held in Ukraine. So scientists have instead had to rely on smaller but often more detailed surveys, many generated in collaboration with the Kyiv International Institute of Sociology. Initially, researchers continued to use Soviet terminology on those surveys. Censuses and surveys <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/census-2020-race-ethnicity-questions">shoehorn people into categories</a>, Hale says, but understanding how people’s interpretation of those categories change over time, particularly when the social context changes, is useful (<em>SN: </em><em>3/8/20</em>). Researchers thus needed to look into what people meant when they chose a certain answer.</p>



<p>That work started with the “native language” question on surveys, which even in Soviet times was hard for researchers to interpret. Asking people what they considered to be their native language was meant to capture their language of everyday use. But people often selected the language that aligned with their ethnicity.</p>





<p>For instance, about 12 percent of Ukrainians selected Russian as their native language on the 1989 census, Kulyk, the political and ethnic studies scholar at the National Academy of Sciences of Ukraine, said in his talk. But other surveys conducted around that time that did distinguish between native language and language of everyday use revealed that over 50 percent of Ukrainians spoke Russian in everyday life.</p>



<p>That confusion surrounding the native language question carried over to post-Soviet Ukraine. Surveys conducted in the 1990s and 2000s showed that many people selecting Ukrainian as their native language <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/epdf/10.1111/j.1469-8129.2011.00493.x">did not necessarily speak</a> the language, Kulyk reported in 2011 in <em>Nations and Nationalism. </em>&nbsp;</p>



<p>In a more recent analysis of three nationwide surveys in Ukraine — conducted in 2012, 2014 and 2017, and each involving roughly 1,700 to 2,000 respondents — Kulyk investigated responses to the question: “What language do you consider your native language?” In 2012, some 60 percent of respondents said Ukrainian and 24 percent said Russian. By 2017, <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/1060586X.2018.1451232">over 68 percent of respondents selected Ukrainian</a> and just under 13 percent selected Russian, he reported in 2018 in <em>Post-Soviet Affairs</em>.</p>



<p>Those numbers say little about actual language use, Hale says. Instead, the native language question is a way to gauge people’s shifting views of national identity. The growing number of Ukrainian “speakers” and the decreasing number of Russian “speakers” suggests that people are selecting the answer that’s in line with their Ukrainian civic identity, he says. &nbsp;“Knowing Russian isn’t any kind of predictor for supporting the Russian state. Instead, what is [becoming] more important is the civic identification with the Ukrainian state.”</p>



<h4>Choosing Ukraine</h4>



<p>Researchers who study identity have also begun investigating Ukrainians’ responses to the question, “What is your <em>natsionalnist</em>?” which still occasionally appears on official paperwork, Mikheieva says.</p>



<p>Ukrainians filling out those forms can interpret the term as asking about their ethnic background in the Soviet sense, their chosen identity or some combination of both. What social scientists need to understand is how Ukrainians no longer under Soviet rule perceive themselves.</p>



<p>To that end, the three nationwide surveys Kulyk evaluated in his 2018 study all asked people multiple questions about nationality. In one, for instance, participants were told: “… some people consider themselves belonging to several nationalities at the same time. Please look at this card and tell which statement reflects more than the others your opinion about yourself.” People could then select a single nationality or some combination of Russian and Ukrainian nationalities. That work revealed that the percentage of people selecting only Ukrainian went up from 67.8 percent in 2012 to 81.5 percent in 2017. &nbsp;</p>



<p>What’s more, the greatest rise occurred among people living in the historically Russian strongholds of eastern and southern Ukraine. In 2012, some 40 percent of Ukrainians from that region selected “only Ukrainian” compared with almost 65 percent in 2017. Meanwhile, the percentage of eastern and southern Ukrainians identifying as “only Russian” decreased from roughly 17 percent in 2012 to less than 5 percent in 2017.</p>



<p>The actual percentage of Ukrainians allying with Russia might be slightly higher, however, as Kulyk and other researchers have been unable to collect more recent data from the Russian-controlled Crimean Peninsula and the disputed Donbas region.</p>



<p>More recent research also suggests that the Ukrainian people are gradually shedding their Soviet understanding of identity. For instance, in a 2018 survey of over 2,000 people, some 70 percent of respondents said that their <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/1060586X.2020.1851541#:~:text=The%20findings%20indicate%20that%2C%20if,central%20part%20of%20the%20process.">Ukrainian citizenship</a> constituted at least part of their identity, Barrington reported in 2021 in <em>Post-Soviet Affairs. </em>That’s due, in part, to Ukrainian leaders’ concerted efforts to shift away from ethnic nationalism and toward civic nationalism, Barrington wrote<em>. </em>Deprioritizing ethnicity weakens the linguistic and regional divides; civic nationalism, meanwhile, bonds people through “feelings of solidarity, sympathy and obligation.”&nbsp;</p>

<p>Broadly speaking, researchers say, these surveys all show that identification with the Ukrainian state began immediately after the country achieved independence, and accelerated following Russian aggression in the region in 2014.</p>



<p>The current war, by extension, is almost certainly cementing many Ukrainians’ loyalty to their country, everyone interviewed for this story said. “In some paradoxical twist,” says Shevel. “Putin is basically unifying the Ukrainian nation.”</p>



<p>Identity grows stronger, and internal divisions weaker, when nations are under attack, says Giuliano, the political scientist at Columbia University. During an invasion, “you are going to rally around the flag. You’re going to support the country in which you live.”</p>

                <img width="140" height="110" src="https://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2022/04/v1-140x110.jpg" class="attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image" alt="" style="display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear:both;" /><p>The increasing use of internet, social media, wearable and mobile devices, and various e-health services, claims and billing activities, hospital and pharmacy records, product and disease registries, etc, has led to the rapid generation of various types of digital data related to population health. However, the voluminosity and complexity of real-world data urge for the development of more appropriate, sophisticated, robust, and innovative data analytic techniques to make the best use of them. In the medical field, real-world data (RWD) can be defined as data relating to health outcomes or the delivery of healthcare routinely collected in real-world settings.</p>
<p>RWD have several characteristics as compared to data collected from randomized trials in controlled settings. First, RWD are observational, as opposed to data gathered in a controlled setting. Second, many types of RWD are unstructured (e.g., texts, imaging, networks) and at times inconsistent due to entry variations across providers and health systems. Thus, RWD can be messy, incomplete, heterogeneous, and subject to different types of measurement errors and biases. In some cases, the collected data are also an unrepresentative sample of the underlying population, sometimes occurring without notice or lacking information to validate. Third, RWD may be generated in a high-frequency manner (e.g., millisecond levels in ECGs and from wearables), resulting in voluminous and dynamic data. The messiness of RWD is well-recognized; how to improve the data quality and properly use RWD to generate unbiased RWE is a work in progress.</p>
<p>The increasing volume of RWD and the fast development of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) data analytics techniques, together with rising costs and recognized limitations of the traditional clinical trials, has spurred great interest in the use of RWD to enhance the efficiency of research and bridge the gap between clinical research and daily practice. During the COVID-19 pandemic, RWD were consistently used to generate RWE on the effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccination, to model localized COVID-19 control strategies, to study behavioral and mental health changes in relation to the lockdown of public life, among others.</p>
<p>A wide range of methodologies can be used to make appropriate and effective usage of RWD derived from pragmatic trials, which are designed, in principle, to test the effectiveness of an intervention in the real-world clinical setting. Pragmatic trials measure various types of outcomes, mostly patient-centered, instead of the typical measurable symptoms or markers in the classical explanatory trials. Due to the characteristics of RWD, new guidelines and methodologies from explanatory trials have been developed to generate unbiased RWE for decision making and causal inference, especially for the per-protocol analysis, arguably more relevant for decision-making purposes.</p>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-12821" src="https://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2022/04/blogpostRW.png" alt="" width="370" height="242" srcset="https://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2022/04/blogpostRW.png 370w, https://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2022/04/blogpostRW-300x196.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 370px) 100vw, 370px" />
<p>Target trial emulation is the application of trial design and analysis principles from randomized trials to the analysis of observational data. Target trial emulation can be an important tool especially when comparative evaluation is not yet available or feasible in randomized trials. Controlling for selection bias and confounding is key to the validity of this approach because of the lack of randomization and potentially unrecognized baseline differences, and the control group needs to be comparable with the treated group.</p>
<p>In terms of data analytical approaches, ML techniques are getting increasingly popular and are powerful tools for predictive modelling. Moreover, new, and more powerful ML techniques are being developed rapidly. There are also many open-source codes (e.g., on Github) and software libraries (e.g., TensorFlow, Pytorch, Keras) out there to facilitate the implementation of these techniques. Statistical modelling and inferential approaches are alos necessary for making sense of RWD, obtaining causal relationships, testing/validating hypotheses, and generating regulatory-grade RWE to inform policymakers and regulators in decision making. The motivation for and the design and analysis principles in pragmatic trials and target trial emulation are to obtain causal inference, with more innovative methods beyond the traditional statistical methods to adjust for potential confounders and improve the capabilities of RWD for causal inference. A well-known framework in that direction is targeted learning that has been successfully applied in causal inference for dynamic treatment rules using EHR data and efficacy of COVID-19 treatments, among others.</p>
<p>In conclusion, RWD have the potential to generate valid and unbiased RWE with savings in both cost and time and to enhance the efficiency of medical and health-related research and decision- making, compared to controlled trials. At the same time, RWD have limitations. Procedures that improve the quality of the data and overcome the limitation of RWD to make the best of them have been and will continue to be developed.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/climate-change-storms-deadly-africa-early-2022">Climate change intensified deadly storms in Africa in early 2022</a></h4>

              
                <p>Climate change amped up the rains that pounded southeastern Africa and killed hundreds of people during two powerful storms in early 2022.</p>



<p>But a dearth of regional data made it difficult to pinpoint <a href="https://www.worldweatherattribution.org/">just how large of a role climate change played</a>, scientists said April 11 at a news conference.</p>



<p>The findings were described in a study, published online April 11, by a consortium of climate scientists and disaster experts called the World Weather Attribution network.</p>





<p>A series of tropical storms and heavy rain events battered southeast Africa in quick succession from January through March. For this study, the researchers focused on two events: Tropical Storm Ana, which led to flooding in northern Madagascar, Malawi and Mozambique in January and killed at least 70 people; and Cyclone Batsirai, which inundated southern Madagascar in February and caused hundreds more deaths.</p>





<p>To search for the fingerprints of climate change, the team first selected a three-day period of heavy rain for each storm. Then the researchers tried to amass observational data from the region to reconstruct historical daily rainfall records from 1981 to 2022.</p>



<p>Only four weather stations, all in Mozambique, had consistent, high-quality data spanning those decades. But, using the data on hand, the team was able to construct simulations for the region that represented climate with and without human-caused greenhouse gas emissions.</p>



<p>The aggregate of those simulations revealed that climate change did play a role in intensifying the rains, Izidine Pinto, a climatologist at the University of Cape Town in South Africa, said at the news event. But with insufficient historical rainfall data, the team “could not quantify the precise contribution” of climate change, Pinto said.</p>



<p>The study highlights how information on extreme weather events “is very much biased toward the Global North … [whereas] there are big gaps in the Global South,” said climate scientist Friedericke Otto of Imperial College London.</p>



<p>That’s an issue also highlighted by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. The IPCC cites insufficient Southern Hemisphere data as a barrier to <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/climate-change-un-ipcc-report-humans">assessing the likelihood of increasing frequency and intensity of tropical cyclones</a> beyond the North Atlantic Ocean (<em>SN: 8/9/21</em>).</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/neptune-temperature-atmosphere-new-thermal-maps">New thermal maps of Neptune reveal surprising temperature swings</a></h4>

              
                <p>Neptune’s atmospheric temperature is on an unexpected roller-coaster ride, and it could take decades for scientists to piece together what’s happening at the distant planet.</p>



<p>The ice giant’s global temperature <a href="https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/PSJ/ac5aa4">dropped about 8 degrees Celsius</a> between 2003 and 2012 at the start of Neptune’s summer, researchers report April 11 in <em>Planetary Sciences Journal</em>. Then from 2018 to 2020, thermal images show that the planet’s <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/neptunes-balmy-south-pole">south pole</a> brightened dramatically, indicating a spike of 11 degrees C (<em>SN: 10/2/07</em>).</p>



<p>Naomi Rowe-Gurney, a planetary scientist at NASA Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Md., and colleagues looked at 17 years of mid-infrared data <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/move-over-hubble-sharp-pic-neptune-was-taken-earth">from ground-based telescopes</a> and the no-longer-functioning <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/nasa-spitzer-telescope-mission-ends-look-back-discoveries">Spitzer Space Telescope</a> (<em>SN: 7/18/18</em>; <em>SN: 1/28/20</em>). The researchers used infrared light to pierce Neptune’s top cloud layer and peer at its stratosphere, where the planet’s atmospheric chemistry comes into view.</p>





<p>Each Neptune year lasts 165 Earth years, so the time period analyzed — from 2003 to 2020 — is essentially equivalent to five weeks on Earth. The wildest temperature shift occurred from 2018 to 2020, when the atmospheric temperature at Neptune&#8217;s south pole rose from –121° C to –110° C.</p>



<div class="wp-block-sciencenews-content-sidebar">
<h3>Temperature swings</h3>



<p>These mid-infrared images from the Very Large Telescope in Cerro Paranal, Chile, and the Subaru Telescope atop Mauna Kea in Hawaii, show thermal snapshots of Neptune from 2006 to 2020. The map dims after 2006 (top left), showing a global cooling. But between 2018 and 2020, Neptune’s south pole lit up, indicating it warmed by 11 degrees Celsius by 2020 (bottom right).</p>

<p>“We weren&#8217;t expecting any seasonal changes to happen in this short time period, because we’re not even seeing a full season,” says Rowe-Gurney. “It’s all very strange and interesting.”</p>



<p>The researchers don’t yet know what’s causing the temperature changes. The sun’s ultraviolet rays break up methane molecules in the stratosphere, so that chemistry or even the sun’s activity cycle could be a trigger. Nailing down specifics requires more observations. “We need to keep observing over the next 20 years to see a full season and see if something else changes,” says Rowe-Gurney.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/bird-mound-building-australia-ecosystem-malleefowl">How a mound-building bird shapes its Australian ecosystem</a></h4>

              
                <p>Earthen piles built by a chicken-like bird in Australia aren’t just egg incubators — they may also be crucial for the distribution of key nutrients throughout the ecosystem.</p>



<p>In the dry woodlands of South Australia, sandy mounds rise between patches of many-stemmed “mallee” eucalyptus trees. These monuments — big enough to smother a parking space — are nests, painstakingly constructed by the malleefowl bird. By inadvertently engineering a patchwork of nutrients and churned soil, the industrious malleefowl <a href="https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1365-2745.13883">may be molding surrounding plant and soil communities</a> and even blunting the spread of fire, researchers report March 27 in the <em>Journal of Ecology</em>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Such ecosystem impacts suggest malleefowl conservation could benefit many species, says Heather Neilly, an ecologist at the Australian Landscape Trust in Calperum Station. The species is currently listed as “vulnerable” and declining by the International Union for Conservation of Nature.</p>





<p>Some animals — termed “ecosystem engineers” — produce habitats for other species by shaping the environment around them. Beavers build dams that create homes for pond-dwelling lifeforms. In deserts, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/burrowing-birds-owls-plant-life-desert-landscape">owls</a> and <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/monitor-lizards-huge-burrow-systems-shelter-small-animals">giant lizards</a> support plant and animal life with their burrows (<em>SN: 10/8/19</em>;<em> SN: 1/19/21</em>).</p>



<p>“In Australia in particular, the focus has largely been on our array of digging mammals,” Neilly says.</p>





<p>But malleefowl (<em>Leipoa ocellata</em>) — found throughout western and southern Australia — also perturb the soil. They and their close relatives are “megapodes,” a group of fowl native to Australasia and the South Pacific that have the unusual habit of incubating their eggs much like alligators do: in a massive pile of rotting compost. Heat from the decaying vegetation — locked in with an insulating sand layer on top — regulates the eggs’ temperature, and the young scratch their way to the surface upon hatching.</p>



<p>Neilly and her colleagues wanted to investigate the impact that nest building has on soil chemistry and vegetation cover in the mallee ecosystem.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In a mallee woodland in rural South Australia, the team selected 12 mounds of varying ages. Each mound had five “microsites” — the mound itself, the ground under a nearby eucalyptus tree and under a faraway tree, and a near and far open patch of ground. At each microsite, the team analyzed nutrients in the soil and measured plant cover, abundance of individual plants and the relative cover of leaf litter and bare ground.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Much of the mallee woodland is nutrient-poor, with islands of resources where the eucalyptus trees sprout. But when malleefowl collect leaf litter from vegetation patches to make their mounds in open areas, they create a unique type of habitat patch, the team found. The nests have little plant life, but their soil has carbon and pH levels like those of tree microsites. Mounds also have nitrogen and phosphorus levels in their soil that are higher than any other microsite.</p>



<p>The impacts aren’t limited to just the mounds themselves. Even nearby open sites have higher soil phosphorus than far ones, and nearby tree sites less than six years old have more bare ground due to leaf litter harvesting.<br><br>Many of these mound attributes decline with age, the team reports, with the exception of soil carbon, which remains enhanced in the oldest mounds.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The malleefowls’ impact on nutrient distribution isn’t surprising “given the huge quantity of soil and litter that these birds displace when building their mounds,” says Michelle Louw, a plant ecologist at Germany’s University of Bayreuth who is based in Johannesburg and was not involved with the research.</p>



<p>But the magnitude of the malleefowls’ impact is surprising, as is the fact that the effect is traceable even in surrounding open and wooded microsites, says Orsolya Valkó, a plant ecologist at the Center for Ecological Research in Budapest also not involved with this research.</p>



<p>“This way the birds create three new microsite types in an already mosaic system, which is fascinating,” she says.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Malleefowl aren’t just shuffling soil nutrients and vegetation patterns. Neilly and her team note that the tops of the mounds and surrounding bare patches have very little fuel for fires to burn, so malleefowl may also help regulate the spread of fire in mallee woodlands.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Previous research by Neilly’s team also found that <a href="https://www.birdlife.org.au/afo/index.php/afo/article/view/2222">the mounds are widely used by Australian fauna</a>. Vertebrate animals visited mounds 50 percent more frequently than nonmound sites, with five times as many vertebrate species hanging around the mounds.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/mars-two-sound-speeds-laser-helicopter">Mars has two speeds of sound</a></h4>

              
                <p>On Mars, the speed of sound depends on its pitch.</p>



<p>All sound travels slower through Mars’ air compared with Earth’s. But the higher-pitched clacks of a laser zapping rocks <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-022-04679-0">travels slightly faster in the thin Martian atmosphere</a> than the lower-pitched hum of the Ingenuity helicopter, researchers report April 1 in <em>Nature</em>.</p>



<p>These sound speed measurements from NASA’s Perseverance rover are part of a broader effort to monitor minute-by-minute changes in atmospheric pressure and temperature, like during wind gusts, on the Red Planet.</p>





<p>“The wind is the sound of science for us,” says astrophysicist Baptiste Chide of Los Alamos National Laboratory in New Mexico.</p>



<p>To listen to the wind, Perseverance carries two microphones. One was meant to <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/video-mars-nasa-perseverance-rover-landing-audio">record audio</a> during the mission’s <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/mars-how-watch-nasa-perseverance-lander-touch-down">complex entry, descent and landing</a>, and while it didn’t work as hoped, it is now turned on occasionally to listen to the rover’s vitals (<em>SN: 2/22/21; SN: 2/17/21</em>). The other microphone is part of the rover’s SuperCam instrument, a mast-mounted mishmash of cameras and other sensors used to understand the properties of materials on the planet’s surface.</p>



<p>But these microphones also pick up other sounds, such as those made by the rover itself as its wheels crunch the surface, and by Perseverance’s flying companion, the robotic helicopter Ingenuity. The SuperCam instrument, for example, has a laser, which Perseverance fires at interesting rocks for <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/nasa-perseverance-rover-mars-instruments-life">further analysis</a> (<em>SN: 7/28/20</em>). The microphone on SuperCam captures sounds from those laser shots, which helps researchers learn about the hardness of the target material, says planetary scientist Naomi Murdoch of the Institut Supérieur de l&#8217;Aéronautique et de l&#8217;Espace in Toulouse, France.</p>



<p>Murdoch, Chide and their colleagues listened to the laser’s clack-clack when zapping rocks. (“It doesn&#8217;t do, really, ‘pew pew,’” Murdoch says). When the laser hits a target, that blast creates a sound wave. Because scientists know when the laser fires and how far away a target is, they can measure the speed at which that sound wave travels through the air toward the SuperCam microphone.</p>

<h4>Laser zaps</h4>



<p>This recording from a microphone onboard NASA’s Perseverance rover on Mars captures the clacking sound of the robot’s laser zapping rocks<strong>.</strong></p>

</div>



<p>The speed of this sound is about 250 meters per second, the team reports. That’s slower than on Earth, where sound travels through the air at about 340 m/s.</p>



<p>The slower speed isn’t surprising. What we hear as sound is actually pressure waves traveling through a medium like air, and the speed of those waves <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/sound-new-speed-limit-physics-fundamental-constants-earth">depends on the medium’s density and composition</a> (<em>SN: 10/9/20</em>). Our planet’s atmosphere is 160 times as dense as the Martian atmosphere, and Earth’s air is mostly nitrogen and oxygen, whereas the Martian air is predominately carbon dioxide. So sound on Mars travels slower in that different air.</p>



<p>The team also used the SuperCam microphone to listen to <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/ingenuity-helicopter-flying-mars-perseverance-nasa">the lower-pitch whirl of Ingenuity’s helicopter blades</a> (<em>SN: 12/10/21</em>). From this lower-pitched sound, the researchers learned that there is a second speed of sound at the Martian surface at frequencies below 240 hertz, or slightly deeper than middle C on a piano: 240 m/s.</p>



<div class="wp-block-sciencenews-content-sidebar">
<h4>Helicopter hum</h4>



<p> This recording from the same microphone captures wind gusts and the distant hum of the Ingenuity helicopter’s blades, as the helicopter touches down about 80 meters from the rover.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-audio"><audio controls src="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/040522_lk_marssounds_helicopter.mp3"></audio></figure>

</div>



<p>In contrast, at Earth&#8217;s surface, sound moves through the air at only one speed, no matter the pitch. The two speeds on Mars, the researchers say, are because of its carbon dioxide–rich atmosphere. Carbon dioxide molecules behave differently with one another when sound waves with frequencies above 240 hertz move through the air compared with those below 240 hertz, affecting the waves’ speed.</p>



<p>“We&#8217;ve proved that we can do science with a microphone on Mars,” Chide says. “We can do <em>good</em> science.”</p>



<p>The SuperCam microphone captures thousands of sound snippets per second. Those sounds are affected by air pressures, so the researchers can use that acoustic data to track detailed changes in air pressures over short timescales, and, in doing so, learn more about the Martian climate. While other Mars rovers have had wind, temperature and pressure sensors, those could sense changes only over longer periods.</p>



<p>“Listening to sounds on another planet is another way that helps all of us place ourselves as if we were there,” says Melissa Trainer, a planetary scientist at NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Md., who was not part of this work.</p>



<p>The team is focusing on next collecting acoustic data at different times of day and different seasons on Mars.</p>



<p>“The pressure changes a lot on Mars throughout the year with the seasons,” Trainer says. “I’m really excited to see how the data might change as it gets collected through proceeding seasons.”</p>

Over the years, the themes have highlighted the impact of obesity, the importance of a healthy lifestyle to reduce the development of risk factors for kidney disease, the role of diabetes, and the lack of recognition of pregnancy complications as a marker of future kidney disease.   This year there was a shift in theme from a focus on a risk factor or a population at risk to an acknowledgement of the biggest challenge facing kidney disease:  the knowledge gap. </span><br />
The last 2 to 3 years have been marked by the <a href="https://doi.org/10.1007/s11886-022-01637-0">use of SGLT2 inhibitors with the potential of improving renal and cardiovascular outcomes</a>, the signing of the <a href="https://doi.org/10.2215/CJN.10560919">American Kidney Health initiative for the promotion of transplantation and home dialysis modalities</a>, and the<a href="https://doi.org/10.1053/j.ajkd.2021.08.003"> final report by the NKF-ASN Task Force on Reassessing the Inclusion of Race in Diagnosing Kidney Diseases</a> recommending incorporation the CKD-EPI Creatinine formula that did not incorporate a race modifier and support of finding newer markers for improved estimation of kidney function. <span style="font-weight: 400">All of these have contributed to moving forward in nephrology care through new treatment options and expanding access to care but don’t address the biggest challenge to kidney care which is awareness of the prevalence, the scope of those at risk, and the downstream impact to financial and socioeconomic parameters.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The concept of ‘ bridging the knowledge gap’ should not stop with the development of patient education programs but needs to be expanded to target caregivers, health care providers and government organizations.  This approach validates the effects of kidney disease not being limited to physical changes.  The diagnosis of kidney disease and the need for renal replacement therapy, either dialysis or transplantation, are life-changing with potential losses of vocation, income, socioeconomic status, and functional status.  Consideration for the caregiver role and challenges needs to be part of the discussions about kidney disease management.  Kidney disease screening and early intervention have to be prioritized for primary care providers given the rising health care costs associated with late presentation, and the risk of cardiovascular complications.   Advocacy efforts are also part of the strategy to hopefully have renal disease be more visible to public policymakers.   This will be particularly important to advocate for the needs of those without traditional risk factors of kidney disease such as chronic kidney disease of unknown etiology/uncertain cause (CKDu) and those that developed <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32489502/">acute kidney injury in the setting of COVID</a> infections where those without many resources are disproportionately affected.   </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Bridging this knowledge gap will be essential to improving kidney care for all worldwide. </span></p>

<p>More and more scientists and engineers are beginning to believe that solar conversion will account for a significant portion of the world’s future power needs.… What has changed the atmosphere lately is … the possibility of putting together large-scale units, solar-energy “farms” that would compete with power stations in the megawatt range and higher.</p>

<p>Solar energy production in the United States ramped up as solar panels became cheaper to manufacture and <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/greener-green-energy-todays-solar-cells-give-more-they-take">more efficient at generating electricity</a> (<em>SN: 3/1/08, p. 133</em>). Since the first U.S. solar power plant opened in 1982, thousands more have been built, bringing the country’s solar capacity today to more than 100 gigawatts. In 2021, solar energy made up nearly 3 percent of the electricity produced in the United States. And the future is looking bright: Solar energy and storage is projected to <a href="https://www.eia.gov/todayinenergy/detail.php?id=51518">account for more than 60&nbsp;percent</a> of the U.S. power grid’s new generating capacity from 2022 through 2023, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2022/04/08/text-message-nudges-that-initially-increased-covid-vaccine-uptake-were-not-effective-later-in-pandemic/">Text message “nudges” that initially increased Covid vaccine uptake were not effective later in pandemic</a></h4>

              
                <p><em>By</em>&nbsp;<a href="https://twitter.com/mattbwarren">Matthew Warren</a></p>



<p>Last year a paper made headlines with the finding that basic text message reminders can increase uptake of the Covid vaccine. In fact, we covered the research <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2021/08/26/claim-your-dose-how-text-message-reminders-can-increase-uptake-of-covid-19-vaccines/">right here</a> at <em>Research Digest</em>. As we wrote at the time, the results showed that simple techniques to “nudge” people into taking the vaccine could have a substantial impact if applied across the population.</p>



<p>But according to a <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-022-04526-2">new study</a> in <em>Nature</em>, these nudges have a pretty limited shelf-life. The team finds that timing really matters: while text message reminders increased uptake immediately after the vaccine became available, later in the pandemic they were no longer effective.</p>



<span id="more-45961"></span>



<p>In the <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-021-03843-2">original paper</a>, researchers studied people who had just become eligible for the vaccine. A day after they were notified that they were eligible, some participants received a reminder text message, which included a link to book a slot for vaccination. Others didn’t receive the reminder. The team found that participants who got the reminder were more likely to book an appointment, and were also more likely to have received the vaccine within four weeks. Reminders that included ownership language, telling people that a vaccine had “just been made available for you” and to “claim your dose”, were particularly effective.</p>



<p>But this study took place in January and February 2021 when vaccines had only just become available, and participants received the messages as soon as they were eligible. So Nathaniel Rabb from Brown University and colleagues wondered whether the messages would also be effective later on in the pandemic.</p>



<p>The team conducted a trial of similar messages on 142,428 people living in Rhode Island who had not yet been vaccinated. At the start of the study, which took place in May and June 2021, all Rhode Islanders had been eligible to receive the vaccine for five weeks and availability was widespread.</p>



<p>Participants were randomly assigned to receive one of eight messages, sent out by the state’s Department of Health. All of these included the kind of ownership language that had been so effective in the previous study (in this case “a vaccine is waiting for you”); some included further messaging including information about vaccine safety or how vaccination can reduce risk to one’s family members. They also included a link to a page providing information about vaccination options. A control group didn’t receive any messages.</p>



<p>The researchers looked at the likelihood that a participant had been vaccinated both one week after receiving the message, and at the end of the study period. Vaccination rates were low — only 2% of the control group had received the vaccine by the end of the study. And, in contrast to the original paper, participants who had received a reminder were no more likely than the control participants to get vaccinated. Furthermore, when the team looked at each kind of message individually, there wasn’t a single version that increased the likelihood someone would receive the vaccine.</p>



<p>The study suggests that a nudge technique that seemed pretty effective when vaccines first became available might not actually work later on. “Public health officials—especially those avoiding or legally barred from mandates—may turn to this strategy to increase vaccination rates among the less enthusiastic but will probably see minimal impact,” the team concludes.</p>



<p>The researchers suggest a number of explanations for the lack of effect. Given that these were people who had still not received the vaccine more than a month after it had become available, perhaps they simply represent a group that had strong anti-vaccine opinions — and so were resistant to attempts to “nudge” them. By this point in time, people may also have been overwhelmed with messages about vaccination, and by the increasingly polarised debates about vaccines in the media and online. Further work should try to disentangle all these effects.</p>



<p>These results don&#8217;t mean that reminder messages about vaccines are ineffective —  just that they need to be timed correctly. And, the researchers add, even if they don’t convince more reluctant groups to get vaccinated, “we know of no studies showing reduced vaccinations owing to message campaigns, so they carry little potential harm.”</p>



<p>Yet there are important practical issues to consider. It’s only mentioned in passing in the paper’s extended data, but it turns out that the study actually had to end a day earlier than planned, because the Department of Health was receiving complaints from residents who felt they were getting too many messages (the state was also sending out messages about Covid testing, for instance). The Department was worried that people would end up blocking the messages, and wouldn’t receive crucial emergency information.</p>



<p>Despite the authors’ assertions, this does seem like a potential harm — albeit an indirect one — and highlights the fact that these kinds of nudges need to be considered in their broader context. Optimising the timing of such interventions, based on papers like this, is one step to ensuring that they are as useful as possible.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/animal-emotion-behavior-welfare-feelings">How do we know what emotions animals feel?</a></h4>

              
                <p>A dog gives a protective bark, sensing a nearby stranger. A cat slinks by disdainfully, ignoring anyone and everyone. A cow moos in contentment, chewing its cud. At least, that’s what we may think animals feel when they act the way they do. We take our own lived experiences and fill in gaps with our imaginations to better understand and relate to the animals we encounter.</p>



<p>Often, our assumptions are wrong. Take horse play, for example. Many people assume that these muscular, majestic animals are roughhousing just for the fun of it. But in the wild, adult horses rarely play. When we see them play in captivity, it isn’t necessarily a good sign, says Martine Hausberger, an animal scientist at CNRS at the University of Rennes in France.</p>



<p>Hausberger, who raises horses on her farm in Brittany, began studying horse welfare about three decades ago, after observing that people who keep horses often misjudge cues about the animals’ behavior.</p>





<p>Adult horses that play are often ones that have been restrained, Hausberger says. Play seems to discharge the stress from that restriction. “When they have the opportunity, they may exhibit play, and at that precise moment they may be happier,” she says. But “animals that are feeling well all the time don’t need this to get rid of the stress.”</p>



<p>Scientists studying animal behavior and animal welfare are making important strides in understanding how the creatures we share our planet with experience the world. “In the last decade or two, people have gotten bolder and more creative in terms of asking what animals’ emotional states are,” explains Georgia Mason, a behavioral biologist and animal welfare scientist at the University of Guelph in Canada. They’re finding thought-provoking answers amid a wide array of animals.</p>



<p>For instance, recent studies hint that <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-20716-3">picking up a mouse by its tail</a> casts a pall on the animal’s day, and that <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/primitive-signs-emotions-spotted-sugar-buzzed-bumblebees">an unexpected sugar treat may improve a bee’s mood</a>. Crayfish might <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/abs/10.1126/science.1248811">experience anxiety</a>; ferrets can get bored; and octopuses, and perhaps fish, can experience pain.</p>



<p>Such findings could drive changes in how we treat the animals in our care. For instance, a broad scientific review published in November 2021 by the London School of Economics and Political Science concluded that certain invertebrates such as crabs, lobsters and octopuses <a href="https://www.lse.ac.uk/News/News-Assets/PDFs/2021/Sentience-in-Cephalopod-Molluscs-and-Decapod-Crustaceans-Final-Report-November-2021.pdf">should be considered sentient</a> — that is, capable of subjective experiences such as pain and suffering. The conclusions suggest that protection afforded by animal welfare laws should extend to these creatures. One possible outcome: Updates to U.K. animal welfare legislation may make it illegal to boil lobsters alive, requiring swifter, less painful methods to kill the animals.</p>



<p>Yet studying what animals experience is a challenge, says Charlotte Burn, an animal welfare scientist at the Royal Veterinary College in Hatfield, England, and an author of the 2021 review. Researchers can make scientific inferences about how an animal feels based on observable clues from physiology or behavior, she says. But feelings are subjective. “So doing science about this is a bit strange,” Burn says, “because you have to get comfortable with the fact that your key thing is unknowable.”</p>

<h4>Horse sense</h4>



<p>To study horse welfare, Hausberger doesn’t focus on how emotions such as happiness or sadness may manifest in any given moment. She’s interested in a horse’s overall emotional picture — as she puts it, “the chronic state of feeling more positive or negative emotions.”</p>



<p>To determine how content a horse is with its life, people who care for horses would typically look at things like ear position, posture and how attentive the horse is to its environment. Blood markers for anemia, indicating chronic stress, and signs of overall wellness such as appetite and immune system health could also shed light.</p>



<p>Recently, Hausberger and her colleagues tested a more specific and direct measure: the brain waves of horses, collected using electroencephalography, or EEG.</p>



<p>In people, EEG can help <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0896627313009203">assess sleep patterns or diagnose conditions</a> such as epilepsy, stroke or head injury, and researchers now think certain types of brain waves can indicate depression. EEG has been used in animals in veterinary clinics and in laboratory studies, but Hausberger wanted to bring the tool to the animals’ home turf.</p>



<p>Her team created a simplified, portable EEG device that provides “a sort of summary of brain activity,” she says. Five electrodes are placed on a horse’s forehead, attached to a lightweight headset.</p>



<p>The researchers <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.applanim.2021.105271">used this headset EEG to gauge the welfare of 18 horses</a> that wore the device for six 10-minute observations. The results, published March 2021 in <em>Applied Animal Behaviour Science</em>, give a snapshot into the secret lives of horses.</p>

<p>The horses that roamed with their herd outdoors, grazing at will, had more brain waves called theta waves, which have high amplitude and move slowly. In humans, theta waves are thought to reflect calm and well-being. By contrast, the animals that lived in solo stalls with little contact with other horses had more gamma brain waves, the fastest of all brain waves. In people, gamma waves are associated with anxiety and stress.</p>



<h4>Shared evolutionary history</h4>



<p>For most of the last two millennia, Western thinkers roundly rejected the notion that animals have the capacity for feelings. Charles Darwin bucked that trend, proposing a shared evolutionary capacity for emotion across species in his 1872 book, <em>The Expression of the Emotions in Man and Animals</em>. Take fear, for example: “With all or almost all animals, even with birds, Terror causes the body to tremble,” he wrote.</p>



<p>But a psychological theory called behaviorism, which gained prominence in the early 20th century, put a decades-long pall on research into animals’ inner lives. Behaviorists dismissed the prospect of studying subjective experiences, holding that “if you can’t measure it, don’t make up stories about it,” Mason says.</p>



<p>That started to change near the end of the 20th century. For example, in the 1980s, animal welfare researcher Marian Stamp Dawkins of the University of Oxford began probing how animals experience the world. Her studies gave creatures an opportunity to demonstrate what they wanted and how much of a cost they would pay to gain it. Researchers still ask such questions. For instance: <a href="https://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/ufaw/aw/2002/00000011/00000001/art00002">How heavy a door would a hen push for the chance to perch at night?</a></p>



<p>Another approach involves investigating animals’ feelings through the lens of human psychology. Looking for parallels in how humans and other animals process experiences makes sense because our brains and behaviors reflect a shared evolutionary history, says Michael Mendl, an animal welfare researcher at the University of Bristol in England. Researchers routinely probe the minds and brains of rodents and other animals, including flies, fish and primates, to study and develop drugs for human mental disorders such as depression and anxiety. So we should be able to work backward from humans to study feelings in other animals too, Mendl says.</p>

<h4>Mood matters?</h4>



<p>Mendl and psychologist Elizabeth Paul, also at the University of Bristol, narrowed in on one well-known feature of human psychology. People’s emotional states, negative or positive, bias their thoughts and decisions. Psychologists <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6966324/">use the term “affect”</a> for these overarching mental states.</p>



<p>Affect acts as a filter through which one sees the world — rose-colored or turd-smeared glasses, you could say — that is often shaped by positive or negative experiences. Mendl, Paul and graduate student Emma Harding devised <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/427312a">an experiment in the early 2000s</a> that sought to parse whether experiences that might influence a rat’s affect can change the decisions it makes.</p>



<p>The researchers first taught the rats to associate one tone with a positive stimulus (a tasty treat) and another tone with a negative stimulus (an unpleasant noise). The rats learned to press a lever when they heard the positive tone, and not to when they heard the negative one. Then, the researchers placed the animals in either a pleasing, predictable living environment or an annoyingly variable one.</p>



<p>A few days later, for each animal, the researchers played a beep with a wavelength right between the positive and the negative tones. The animals that had lived in the pleasing cage pressed the lever, hinting that they were optimistic that pressing the lever would yield a treat. The ones that lived in the unpredictable cage left the lever alone, or were slower to press it, suggesting they were more pessimistic.</p>



<p>“What we think our test shows is that the animal is in a positive or negative affective state,” Mendl explains. To put it more plainly: The rats’ behaviors could mean that they judged the tone based on whether they felt good about the world. Since that study, researchers have used this task and variations of it to gauge positive and negative affect in at least 22 species, including mammals, birds and insects.</p>



<p>But there’s an important caveat, Mendl says. The experiment, called a judgment bias task, points to whether an animal is experiencing something in its life positively or negatively. However, the task doesn’t demonstrate something more basic — whether an animal can have subjective experiences to begin with.</p>



<p>Animal welfare studies assume that animals are sentient, because if they weren’t, talking about their well-being wouldn’t make sense, Mason says. “But none of the measures we use can assess or check that assumption, because we simply don’t yet know how to assess sentience,” she notes.</p>



<h4>Searching for emotional life</h4>



<p>Mason posits that some animal experiences are probably species-specific. For group-living animals like sheep, for example, “to be isolated probably induces a form of terror that … humans can’t imagine,” Mason says. Or, for creatures like homing pigeons that can sense magnetic fields, being put in a strong magnetic field “may be very upsetting in a way that we don’t have a name for,” she says.</p>



<p>But many other feelings could be shared. For example, a sizable body of evidence suggests that <a href="https://www.cell.com/trends/cognitive-sciences/fulltext/S1364-6613(21)00082-6">stressors from life in captivity can cause depression in animals</a>. What about boredom?</p>



<p>Mason and her colleagues reasoned that a depressed animal would lose interest in its surroundings, but a bored animal might be drawn to both negative and positive stimuli, just to get a reprieve from monotony. That’s what the group showed in 2012. Male minks sought out pleasant experiences — like the smell of female poop, a treat during mating season — but also neutral ones like plastic bottles and even threatening ones like the big leather gauntlets farmers use to catch minks.</p>



<p>Building on Mason’s work, Burn, at Royal Veterinary College, recently found a similar dynamic in ferrets living in a lab. The animals sought out the pleasure of a good whiff of mouse bedding, as well as the distasteful smell of peppermint oil, and they tended to be both drowsy and restlessly aggressive.</p>



<p>Relieving the animals’ boredom with <a href="https://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/ufaw/aw/2020/00000029/00000001/art00002">extra playtime turned their interests away from the negative</a>, Burn and her colleagues reported in February 2020 in <em>Animal Welfare</em>.</p>

<h3>Relieving boredom</h3>



<p>Ferrets living in lab cages were given extra playtime (below, left) to reduce boredom some days and not others. On days when animals got no extra playtime, they more often screeched and lay awake with eyes open, and slept and stood less than when they had extra playtime. The rise in restless behavior may indicate higher levels of boredom. </p>

<h4>Pain in two parts</h4>



<p>Pain, too, is experienced by many animals. Pain has two components, says behavioral and welfare scientist Matthew Leach of Newcastle University in England. One component is physical, simply consisting of the activation of sensory receptors, nerve cells firing or other physiological features — pain’s plumbing, you could say. Animals respond to it with a reflex reaction or a basic learned response; no conscious awareness is required.</p>



<p>The other component is emotional, which is trickier to measure because it manifests in more complex behaviors. For example, mice, which like an ambient temperature up to 10 degrees Celsius higher than in most research labs, build intricate nests in their cages that help them regulate body temperature. When the animals are in pain or distress, their nest-building abilities fall apart.</p>



<p>Facial expressions are a more direct way to assess pain or other types of distress in animals, Leach says. His lab team and others have <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0168159118305240?via%3Dihub">identified a range of expressions</a> in more than a dozen species, from mice to horses. With less than 30 minutes of training, people can learn to accurately see grimaces in animals’ faces, Leach says.</p>



<p>Those faces can reveal more than pain. Using artificial intelligence algorithms to scan videos of mouse faces, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/mice-facial-expressions-can-reveal-wide-range-emotions">researchers have identified a whole range of emotions</a> — pleasure, disgust, fear — encoded in the tilt of the ears or a curl of the nose (<em>SN: 5/9/20 &amp; 5/23/20, p. 16</em>). “We’re still very much in the infancy of understanding what facial expressions are telling us,” Leach says.</p>



<p>Researchers can often infer from an animal’s behavior that it is in pain, Leach says. But making such inferences about animals that are very different from us is more challenging. Take octopuses, for instance. Their three-lobed brain “is as far from a vertebrate as you could possibly ever get,” he says. That evolutionary distance may mean octopuses respond to stimuli differently.</p>



<p>To probe that question, Robyn Crook, a neuroscientist at San Francisco State University, used a learning task to show that octopuses might in fact <a href="https://www.cell.com/iscience/fulltext/S2589-0042(21)00197-8">experience the emotional component of pain</a>, reporting the results on February 22, 2021, in <em>iScience</em>. She first let octopuses loose in a box with three rooms, and each octopus naturally gravitated to a room it preferred.</p>

<p>Then Crook injected the animals with either saline, a slightly painful stimulus (an under-the-skin injection of acetic acid, the acerbic agent in vinegar) or the painful acid along with a pain-relieving medicine. She then put the animals injected with acetic acid into the chamber they preferred most, and the ones injected with acetic acid and the pain killer into the chamber they had liked least. The idea was to allow the octopuses to associate how they felt with the chamber, Crook explains.</p>



<p>A few hours later, after the painful stimulus would have worn off, Crook let the animals explore the three rooms again. The octopuses that got the painful shots avoided their originally preferred room, suggesting they associated it with pain. Those that got the shots with the medicine now preferred the room they had originally disliked, suggesting they associated it with relief from pain. Matching their negative experience in the room with their later experience out of it requires a kind of “mental time travel” that hints at emotional awareness, Crook says. Not everyone agrees with this interpretation. “It is very difficult to produce convincing evidence of affective state in an animal that’s very unlike us,” she says — at least in part because of how mammalian-centric our assumptions tend to be.</p>



<h4>A matter of ethics</h4>



<p>Still, notes Mason, from an ethical and practical point of view, being cautious and treating octopuses as if they do feel pain “is wise and humane.” But researchers are still figuring out where to draw the line across the animal kingdom.</p>



<p>That question prompted the recent U.K. scientific assessment of sentience. The researchers involved reviewed all the literature they could find that might point to clues about the inner lives of cephalopods and crustaceans — studies on behavior and physiology, neuroanatomy and common practices in the seafood industry.</p>



<p>The group’s eight-point checklist considered factors such as whether an animal’s nervous system could integrate different types of sensory information, and the complexity of the animal’s pain-sensing machinery.</p>



<p>“There’s a lot of information out there about animal behavior that is actually relevant to questions of sentience in a way that hasn’t always been appreciated,” says report author Jonathan Birch, a philosopher of science at the London School of Economics and Political Science. But for these species, “there’s not been a lot of intentional investigation.”</p>



<p>Ultimately, says Burn, the group hedged its bets — not because they were sure, but because “the body of evidence is starting to make us think [the animals] deserve the benefit of the doubt,” she says. As researchers settle on ways to parse different emotional states — and on a more basic level, perhaps even ways to identify sentience — we might find a wider basis for a shared inner life across the animal kingdom.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/w-boson-particle-mass-standard-model-physics">The W boson might be extra hefty. If so, it could hint at new physics</a></h4>

              
                <p>There’s something amiss with a mass.</p>



<p>A new measurement of the mass of an elementary particle, the W boson, has defied expectations. The result hints at a possible flaw in physicists’ otherwise stalwart theory of the fundamental bits and bobs of our world, known as the standard model.</p>



<p>That theory predicts a W boson with a mass of about 80,357 million electron volts, or MeV. But <a href="http://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.abk1781">the new measured mass is larger</a>, at 80,433.5 MeV, physicists with the Collider Detector&nbsp;at Fermilab, or CDF, collaboration report in the April 8 <em>Science</em>.</p>





<p>The finding could hint at new particles or other mysteries of physics yet to be discovered. “If confirmed, this would clearly mean very interesting new physics that we can explore,” says theoretical physicist Sven Heinemeyer of the Institute for Theoretical Physics in Madrid.</p>



<p>Still, several earlier, less precise measurements found W boson masses more closely aligned with the standard model, including one from the ATLAS experiment at the Large Hadron Collider at CERN near Geneva. So physicists are awaiting further confirmation before declaring their prized theory incorrect.</p>





<p>“CDF&#8217;s new result seems barely compatible with the previous ones, including its own previous result, which prompts questions,” says ATLAS physicist Maarten Boonekamp of the Institute of Research into the Fundamental Laws of the Universe at Université Paris-Saclay.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Discovered in 1983, the <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/w-particle-physics-missing-link-found">W boson</a> plays an important role in the standard model (<em>SN: 2/5/83</em>). The particle comes in two varieties, with either positive or negative electric charge. Together with their uncharged partner, the Z boson, the particles carry the weak nuclear force, which is responsible for certain types of radioactive decay and plays an important role in the nuclear reactions that power the sun.</p>



<p>Using data that CDF collected from 2002 to 2011, the team looked for W bosons produced in collisions of protons and their antimatter counterparts, antiprotons, in the now-shuttered <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/last-words">Tevatron particle collider</a> at Fermilab in Batavia, Ill. (<em>SN: 9/9/11</em>). The analysis was designed so that researchers couldn’t tell what the end result was until they were done.</p>



<p>The moment of the unveiling was striking, says experimental particle physicist Ashutosh Kotwal of Duke University. “When the answer popped up … we were awestruck about what we might have just learned.”</p>



<p>With a precision of 0.01 percent, the new W boson mass measurement is about twice as precise as the previous record. “This is a very special measurement; this is a true legacy,” says experimental particle physicist Rafael Coelho Lopes de Sá of the University of Massachusetts Amherst, who worked on measuring the W boson mass for another Tevatron experiment. “The level of dedication and care and detail … is amazing.”</p>



<p>The new measurement disagrees with the standard model expectation by 7 sigma, a measure of the statistical significance of a result. That’s well above the 5 sigma that physicists usually require to claim a discovery.</p>



<p>Still, “before getting too excited,” says ATLAS physicist Guillaume Unal of CERN, “I would like to see an independent measurement that confirms the CDF measurement.” In addition to <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1140/epjc/s10052-017-5475-4">the ATLAS measurement</a>, described in 2018 in the <em>European Physical Journal C</em>, another measurement of the W boson’s mass from the CERN experiment LHCb <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/JHEP01(2022)036">was also in line with the standard model prediction</a>, researchers reported in the January <em>Journal of High Energy Physics</em>.</p>



<p>“The W boson mass is notoriously difficult to measure,” says LHCb physicist Mika Vesterinen of the University of Warwick in Coventry, England. That explains why it took CDF so long to wrap up this analysis, published more than 10 years after the experiment ended.</p>



<p>Hopefully, scientists won’t have to wait that long for another measurement. The ATLAS and LHCb collaborations are already working on improved W boson mass analyses. CMS, another experiment at CERN, could also size up the particle.</p>



<p>If the new measurement holds up, it’s not yet clear what secrets of physics might be at play. New particles — such as those predicted by the theory of <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/supersymmetrys-absence-lhc-puzzles-physicists">supersymmetry</a>, which posits that each known particle has a heavier partner — could help shift the W boson mass upward (<em>SN: 9/6/16</em>). Intriguingly, Heinemeyer points out, those same particles might also help explain <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/muon-physics-standard-model-particles">another recent physics mystery</a> — the magnetic gyrations of muons reported by the Muon g−2 experiment (<em>SN: 4/7/21</em>).</p>



<p>Whatever physicists uncover, they’ll gain a new grasp on the particulars of this crucial particle, says theoretical physicist Nathaniel Craig of the University of California, Santa Barbara. “At the end of the day, the added energy and attention devoted to the W mass measurement … will be an immensely positive thing.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/triceratops-dinosaur-hole-skeleton-combat-big-john">A hole in a Triceratops named Big John probably came from combat</a></h4>

              
                <p>A gaping hole in the bony frill of a <em>Triceratops</em> dubbed “Big John” may be a battle scar from one of his peers.</p>



<p>The frill that haloes the head of <em>Triceratops</em> is an iconic part of its look. Equally iconic, at least to paleontologists, are the holes that mar the headgear. For over a century, researchers have debated various explanations for the holes, called fenestrae — from battle scars to natural aging processes. Now, a microscopic analysis of Big John’s partially healed lesion suggests that <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-022-08033-2">it could be a traumatic injury from a fight with another <em>Triceratops</em></a>, researchers report April 7 in <em>Scientific Reports</em>.</p>



<p>In summer 2021, Flavio Bacchia, director of Zoic LLC in Trieste, Italy, was reconstructing the skeleton of Big John, the largest known <em>Triceratops </em>to date, when he noticed a keyhole-shaped fenestra on the right side of its frill. Bacchia then reached out to Ruggero D’Anastasio, a paleopathologist at the “G. D’Annunzio” University of Chieti-Pescara in Italy who studies injuries and diseases in ancient human and other animal remains.</p>



<p>“When I saw, for the first time, the opening, I realized that there was something strange,” D&#8217;Anastasio says. In particular, the irregular margins of the hole were odd. He had never seen anything like it.</p>

<p>To analyze the fossilized tissues around the fenestra, he obtained a piece of bone about the size of a 9-volt battery, cut from the bottom of the keyhole. The rest of Big John sold at an auction for $7.7 million —&nbsp;the most expensive non–<em>Tyrannosaurus rex</em> dinosaur fossil ever.</p>



<p>Looking at the bone under a scanning electron microscope, D&#8217;Anastasio and his team found evidence consistent with the formation processes of new bone that are usually observed in mammals. New bone growth is typically supported by blood vessels, and in the bone near the border of the hole, the tissue was porous and strewn with vascular canals. Farther from the fenestra, the bone showed little evidence of the vessels.</p>





<p>The team found that the irregularity of the hole margins that D’Anastasio had observed was also present at the microscopic level. The border was dappled with microscopic dimples called Howship lacunae, where, in one of the first steps of bone healing, bone cells eroded the existing bone to be replaced with healthy bone. The researchers also observed primary osteons, formations that occur during new bone growth.</p>



<p>In addition, a chemical analysis revealed high levels of sulfur, indicative of proteins involved in new bone formation. In mature bones, sulfur is present in only low quantities.</p>





<p>Taken all together, it was clear that this particular fenestra was a partially healed wound. “The presence of healing bone is typical of the response to a traumatic event,” D&#8217;Anastasio says.</p>



<p>Scientists can only hypothesize what happened so long ago. But the location and shape of the wound suggest that Big John’s frill was impaled from behind by a <em>Triceratops</em> rival, adding evidence to the idea that <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/triceratops-may-have-been-headbangers"><em>Triceratops</em></a><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/triceratops-may-have-been-headbangers"> fought with one another</a> (<em>SN: 1/27/09</em>). It was probably an initial puncture that was pulled downward to create the keyhole shape, the researchers say.<strong></strong></p>

<p>“Pathology is a great tool to understand the behavior of dinosaurs,” says Filippo Bertozzo, a dinosaur paleontologist at the Royal Belgian Institute of Natural Sciences in Brussels who was not involved in the study. Dinosaur behavior has long been in the realm of speculation, he says, but analyses like these can provide a glimpse into the lifestyle of these animals.</p>



<p>He adds that this particular wound is “not a Rosetta stone,” because it’s unlikely that all fenestrae are battle injuries. “Fenestration is still a big mystery.”</p>



<p>What’s also a mystery, D’Anastasio says, is why the bone remodeling seen in this <em>Triceratops </em>sample was more similar to healing observed in mammals than in other dinosaurs. And Big John himself might hold more secrets.</p>



<p>“We published an aspect, a paleopathological case,” D&#8217;Anastasio says. “The complete skeleton of Big John must be studied.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/gecko-western-banded-scorpion-eat-shake-video">How a western banded gecko eats a scorpion</a></h4>

              
                <p>Western banded geckos don’t look like they’d win in a fight. Yet this unassuming predator dines on venomous scorpions, and a field study published in the March <em>Biological Journal of the Linnean Society</em> <a href="https://academic.oup.com/biolinnean/article-abstract/135/3/533/6498130"></a><a href="https://academic.oup.com/biolinnean/article-abstract/135/3/533/6498130">shows how the lizards take down such perilous prey</a>.</p>



<p>Geckos bite the scorpion and thrash their heads and upper bodies back and forth, body-slamming the scorpion against the ground, new high-speed video reveals. “The behavior is so fast that you can&#8217;t see what&#8217;s actually happening,” says San Diego State University biologist Rulon Clark. “[You] see the gecko lunge and then see this crazy blur of motion … like trying to watch the wings of a hummingbird.”</p>



<p>Clark first noticed the behavior in the 1990s, during undergraduate fieldwork in the Sonoran Desert near Yuma, Ariz. When he returned with colleagues to <a href="https://www.ninjarat.org/videos">study kangaroo rats and rattlesnakes</a>, the team filmed geckos as well. The researchers captured western banded geckos (<em>Coleonyx variegatus</em>) and dune scorpions (<em>Smeringurus mesaensis</em>) in the desert at night (along with harmless arthropods, like field crickets and sand roaches, to compare), and documented the showdowns.</p>

<p>Normal gecko feeding behavior usually involves lunging out, grabbing prey with their mouth, and chomping it, says Clark. With scorpions, it’s totally different after the initial lunge. Such shake feeding is a known method for carnivores and adventurous eaters. For instance, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/blog/wild-things/how-dolphin-eats-octopus-without-dying">dolphins shake (and toss) octopuses</a> before eating (<em>SN: 4/25/17</em>).</p>





<p>The fact that this delicate, cold-blooded species not known for speed can achieve such physical gyrations is impressive, Clark says. Songbirds called <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/loggerhead-shrikes-songbirds-fling-impale-prey">loggerhead shrikes whip larger predators in circles</a> (<em>SN: 9/7/18</em>), but at a lower frequency (11 hertz compared to 14 Hz in geckos). <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/1565482">Whiptail lizards</a> also violently shake scorpions, but at unknown speeds. The closest documented match to the speed&nbsp; of gecko shake feeding is small <a href="https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rsif.2012.0429">mammals shaking themselves dry</a>; guinea pigs clock in at around 14 Hz, as well.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s unclear how common this behavior is among geckos. And aside from generally subduing a venomous foe, how it works — killing the scorpion, immobilizing it, damaging its stinger, or reducing how much venom gets injected — remains a mystery.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2022/04/preregistered-peer-reviewed-research/">The potential butterfly effect of preregistered peer-reviewed research</a></h4>

              
                <p>Preregistration is the practice of formally registering a study design before experimentation and data collection begin. When deposited in a <strong>repository</strong>, a preregistered study design functions as a statement of intent laying claim to a certain investigatory pathway. The preregistered study design functions as an everyday tool for executing, reporting and repeating high-quality confirmatory investigations, as well as a stable methodological record capable of facilitating reproduction and reuse over the longer term. When practiced at a <strong>journal</strong>, two additional elements are added: peer review feedback, to help optimize the methods, and analytical approach; and provisional acceptance of the resulting research article when the investigation is completed, whatever the outcomes may be.</p>



<p>&ldquo;Peer review of the registered study protocol provides an opportunity to improve the study design before starting to collect the data. That&rsquo;s the most constructive time for the review to happen. And a published registered protocol is a guarantee for the authors that even null results will be published.&rdquo; says Veronique Kiermer, Chief Scientific Officer at PLOS. Authors of preregistered research concur. As <a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2022/04/scholl-and-kolling/">Jacqueline Scholl</a>, Oxford University puts it, &ldquo;&rdquo;One major advantage compared to standard peer-review was that when reviewers made sensible suggestions about additional control variables to collect, we could actually implement this; rather than just thinking &lsquo;we wished we had done that&rsquo;.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>



<p>In practical terms, neither form of preregistration outlined above is all that different from a standard research workflow. When conducting confirmatory research, investigators routinely define a hypothesis, develop methods, and choose how to collect and analyze data. These study design plans are frequently formalized as part of a grant application, and may well undergo peer review during the funding process as well.</p>



<p>Therefore, taking the minimal extra step of depositing a study design with a repository seems like such a small thing. A few buttons clicked, a document uploaded, and a check box or two. Initiating journal peer review earlier in the process is a similarly a minor shift; a simple reorganization of existing processes into a more efficient configuration. And yet, on the individual level, and especially in aggregate, these modest tweaks to the peer review and publication workflow have the potential to exert an outsized impact on research and scientific communication.</p>



<p>Privately depositing a study design with a repository helps researchers stay accountable to themselves, reducing the risk of behaviors like p-hacking, selective publication, or suppressing negative and null research outcomes. Researchers who choose to make their study designs public from the time of deposition help to avoid unnecessary repeated studies, unintentional complementary research, and scooping, freeing up their fellow researchers to pursue different lines of inquiry and improving efficiency in the field. When private repository study designs become public upon publication of a research article, their existence serves to bolster the final work, demonstrating integrity on the part of the authors, and supporting trust among readers. Finally, retaining a permanent methodological record documenting the data collection and analysis as it was actually planned and performed ensures future reproducibility as almost nothing else can.</p>



<p>Refocusing journal peer review on the study design phase exerts more and greater downstream changes. Peer review that focuses on evaluating significance of the research <em>question</em>, the methods and analytical approach <em>before </em>work begins, has the power to shape stronger, more rigorous and more creative research. Making an editorial decision while results are still unknown minimizes the potential impacts confirmation bias and impact bias, taking science communication back to its roots, with an emphasis on quality, rigor, and a pure intellectual curiosity. As Kiermer explains, &ldquo;Preregistration and peer review of the study protocol with a journal is a way to tackle publication bias. As long as the protocol is followed, or any deviations explained, it&rsquo;s a guarantee for the author that the results will be published, even if they don&rsquo;t confirm their hypothesis.&rdquo;</p>



<p>In combination, all of these factors contribute to a more complete and efficient scientific record, replete with studies exploring important hypotheses, performed to the very highest technical standards, and free from the distorting influence of impact-chasing, ego, and bias. A scientific record that is both demonstrably trustworthy, and widely trusted. And with that, there is no telling where science might go, or how quickly.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/leech-blood-meal-wildlife-dna-animals-conservation">Leeches expose wildlife’s whereabouts and may aid conservation efforts</a></h4>

              
                <p>Leeches suck. Most people try to avoid them. But in the summer of 2016, park rangers in China’s Ailaoshan Nature Reserve went hunting for the little blood gluttons.</p>



<p>For months, the rangers searched through the reserve’s evergreen forest, gathering tens of thousands of leeches by hand and sometimes plucking the slimy parasites from the rangers’ own skin. Each time the rangers found a leech, they would place it into a little, preservative-filled tube, tuck the tube into a hip pack and carry on. The work could help aid conservation efforts, at Ailaoshan and elsewhere.</p>



<p>There are many ways to measure how much effort goes into wildlife conservation, but it’s difficult to assess the success of that effort, even in protected areas, says Douglas Yu, an ecologist at the Kunming Institute of Zoology in China.</p>





<p>But bloodthirsty worms may be just the tool for the job. Leeches aren’t picky eaters — they’ll feast on the blood of many different creatures, from amphibians to mammals to fish. Scientists have shown they can extract animal DNA from blood that leeches and other bloodsucking creatures have ingested, what’s known as invertebrate-derived DNA, or iDNA, and identify the source animal.</p>



<p>And some researchers had suggested that iDNA, a type of <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/animal-dna-air-scientist-vacuum-first-time-zoo">environmental DNA</a>, could be used to trace the ranges of animals in an area, Yu says (<em>SN: 1/18/22</em>). “We thought we would just actually just try to do it.”</p>



<p>Enlisting 163 park rangers, Yu and colleagues deputized the leech-hunters with gathering the parasites along rangers’ regular patrol routes, which covered all 172 areas of the reserve.</p>



<p>Three months later, the rangers had gathered 30,468 leeches. After extracting and analyzing animal DNA from the leeches’ blood meals, Yu and colleagues detected the presence of 86 different species, including Asiatic black bears, domestic cattle, endangered Yunnan spiny frogs and, of course, humans.</p>



<p>What’s more, <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-022-28778-8">the iDNA gave clues to where the animals preferred to roam</a>, the researchers report March 23 in <em>Nature Communications</em>. Wildlife biodiversity was greatest in the reserve’s high-altitude interior, the researchers found, while domestic cattle, sheep and goats were more abundant in the reserve’s lower, more accessible zones. Because most of the wild species detected should be able to inhabit all parts of the reserve, the dichotomy suggests that human activity may be pushing wildlife away from certain areas, Yu says.</p>



<p>Compared with other methods for surveying wildlife, using iDNA from leeches is “really cost- and time-efficient and doesn’t require a lot of expertise,” says Arthur Kocher, an ecologist at the Max Planck Institute for the Science of Human History in Jena, Germany, who was not involved in the study.</p>



<p>Camera traps, for instance, are triggered only by animals of large enough size, and the instruments are expensive. Sight-based surveys require trained observers. With leeches, Kocher says, “there are clear advantages.”</p>



<p>Yu and Kocher both suspect that leeches and other bloodsucking critters, such as carrion flies or mosquitoes, will become more popular wildlife surveillance tools in the future. People are becoming more aware of what iDNA brings to the table, Yu says.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/covid-anime-convention-nyc-coronavirus-lessons-masks-tests">What we learned about COVID-19 safety from a NYC anime convention</a></h4>

              
                <p class="has-drop-cap" style="font-size:20px">As Kristin Meyer set up her merchandise booth at the Anime NYC convention last November, she was sure she’d be exposed to the coronavirus at some point during the three-day event. “Getting that many people together in one spot, the chance that absolutely no one had COVID was zero,” she says.</p>



<p>Meyer was one of hundreds of artists who paid for a space to sell their art in the convention’s Artist Alley. Many signed up, despite getting a cold or the flu, bronchitis or pneumonia at previous fan conventions. “I used to get everything,” says Daifei, another artist, who asked to be referred to by their online handle. “Just from being around people.”</p>



<p>Anime NYC, first held in 2017, has become a beloved meeting place for fans of Japanese cartoons known as anime and comics called manga. Fans wearing elaborate anime-inspired costumes enter contests and pose for group photos. Actors who voice popular characters speak on panels and meet attendees for autographs. Media companies offer exclusive previews of their upcoming releases.</p>





<p>In the Artist Alley, attendees buy anime-inspired prints, charms, buttons and other custom-made merchandise. At an event like Anime NYC, artists can make as much as $15,000 in a weekend, says Daniela Muino, an artist who traveled from Texas with her partner to the 2021 convention. “People physically seeing your art in front of them” is great for sales, Muino says.</p>

<p>The greatest draw of Anime NYC for many attendees is connecting with other fans. A hobby typically considered niche takes over one of the country’s largest convention centers — the Javits Center — and drives a three-day party in and around the venue. Even in the midst of a pandemic, the 2021 event drew a record 53,000 attendees from around the United States and 30 other countries.</p>



<p>People were clearly drawn to get together. “Self-isolating rules are vital [in a pandemic],” says Robin Wollast, a psychology researcher at Stanford University. But “they also undermine deep-rooted needs for social bonding.” In-person events can be crucial for mental health, he says, despite the health risks they pose.</p>



<p>Attendees aware of those risks were not surprised when news broke in early December that the convention may have been a superspreader event; one of the first U.S. cases of COVID-19 due to the highly contagious omicron variant had been traced back to Anime NYC. The shock came later, in February, when the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported that, in fact, omicron had not spread widely at the convention.</p>



<p>Anime NYC may offer some lessons for making large events safer now and in the post-pandemic future.</p>



<h4>What went right?</h4>



<p>Peter McGinn, who works in health insurance, felt confident flying to New York City from his Minneapolis home for the convention. The 31-year-old knew the virus spreads easily through the air. But he was fully vaccinated and boosted, as were many of his 30 or so friends coming in from more than 10 states. The group used Anime NYC as a long weekend party; they shared accommodations and socialized at the city’s restaurants, bars and karaoke venues.</p>



<p>“I felt pretty comfortable based off of everything I did to protect myself, and what the people I was with did to protect themselves and everybody around us,” says McGinn, referring to his friends’ vaccination status and their masking in the venue, except when eating or drinking.</p>



<p>Once back in Minneapolis, McGinn didn’t feel great, but he attributed his symptoms to “normal con fatigue.” Plenty of attendees of these and similar events expect to get sick. At the American Geophysical Union’s annual meeting, for example, attendees ruefully refer to “AGU flu,” which spreads among conference-goers every year.</p>



<p>When one of McGinn’s convention friends tested positive for COVID-19, McGinn took a PCR test, which came back positive. A week into his 10-day quarantine, the Minnesota Department of Health called to tell McGinn that he was the first known person in his state to be infected with the omicron variant. Once the health department learned he had been to the crowded convention in New York City, McGinn spent hours helping both Minnesota’s state agency and the CDC with contact tracing.</p>





<p>Once word got out that McGinn had omicron and that several of his convention-going <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/12/04/world/omicron-anime-convention-nyc.html">friends had also tested positive</a>, news reports suggested he may have been patient zero for a potential superspreader event at the anime convention.</p>



<p>This news was reminiscent of the February 2020 biotech conference in Boston that had become one of the first superspreader events in the United States. Infections at that conference <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.abe3261">may have been linked to more than 300,000 cases</a>, researchers reported in<em> Science</em> in December 2020.</p>



<p>In January, McGinn said he hoped the investigation into Anime NYC would push back against the perception that this convention had been a superspreader. “It’s overwhelmingly likely that where I caught COVID was outside of the event at dinner or karaoke,” he says. While at the convention center, he and his friends constantly wore masks.</p>



<p>McGinn felt vindicated when the results of the investigation were published as a pair of reports in the Feb. 18 <em>Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report</em>. One study <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/71/wr/mm7107a3.htm?s_cid=mm7107a3_w">focused on McGinn and his friend group</a>, and the other presented a <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/71/wr/mm7107a4.htm?s_cid=mm7107a4_w">big-picture view of COVID-19 at the convention</a>. The researchers searched state and local health databases for test results from about 34,500 out of the 53,000 convention attendees whose contact information was available from the event organizers. They identified 119 cases among 4,560 people who got tested. Of those 119 cases, 16 were in McGinn’s friend group — and the only cases confirmed as omicron were among those 16.</p>



<p>The CDC characterizes a superspreader event as one infectious person giving the corona­virus to many others at a rate higher than average transmission. This didn’t occur at Anime NYC, the investigation found, because the rate of positive tests among convention attendees was close to the overall rate in New York City two weeks after the convention: about 3 percent.</p>



<p>“It’s nice to confirm that the event wasn’t a spreader event,” McGinn said after receiving news of the reports. “It makes me more comfortable in the future going to these types of events as long as mask and vax requirements are in place.”</p>

<h3>Recipe for success</h3>



<p>Convention venues and organizers can choose from a menu of options to help keep patrons safe from COVID-19 and other infectious diseases, says Mark Billik, founder of the marketing company BeCore, which organizes COVID-19–safe events.</p>



<h6>For safe arrival and to avoid overcrowding at the venue entrance, provide:</h6>



<ul id="block-f023df4d-a85a-42fd-a713-aa1e30c5f3ad"><li>Enough staff to check vaccination cards</li><li>Advanced verification of vaccine status</li><li>Staggered arrival times</li><li>Pre-event rapid testing</li></ul>



<h6>For social distancing inside the venue:</h6>



<ul><li>Put designated eating areas away from main convention halls</li><li>Provide outdoor eating areas with heaters (in winter)</li><li>Offer wristbands so attendees can signal their comfort level with personal contact, such as hugs</li><li>Make it easy to cancel if sick, without financial loss</li><li>Mail a mask, rapid tests and hand sanitizer to attendees</li></ul>



<h6>E-mail or text reminders to attendees:</h6>



<ul><li>Get vaxxed in plenty of time before event</li><li>Review the event’s safety protocols</li><li>Stay home if you don’t feel well</li></ul>
</div>



<h4>Layers of protection</h4>



<p>The CDC reports attribute this convention’s success to layers of safety measures put in place, including masks, vaccine checks and good ventilation.</p>



<p>“Everyone was always wearing their masks … when speaking to me or walking past my table,” Meyer says. She notes, however, that some costumed attendees took their masks off for photo shoots. And the Artist Alley was also located near the food court, where attendees took off their masks to eat.</p>



<p>Muino was impressed by the safety behaviors she saw at the convention in comparison with her home state of Texas. Still, the spacing of tables in Artist Alley “felt way too close together” for social distancing, she recalls. During busy periods, the area became incredibly crowded.</p>



<p>“There’s only so much control you can exert over a population that large,” Muino says. “People are going to take their masks off for pictures. They’re going to take them off to talk to friends.”</p>

<p>Attendees needed to show proof that they’d received at least one vaccine dose, following <a href="https://covid19.columbia.edu/content/new-york-city-vaccination-requirements">the city’s regulations at the time</a>. Among 3,845 attendees whose test results and vaccination status were both available from local health departments, 3.4 percent were partially vaccinated, 84.5 percent were fully vaccinated and 12.1 percent had received a booster dose. Studies have shown that <a href="https://www.bmj.com/content/374/bmj.n2029">partial vaccination offers significantly less protectio</a>n against COVID-19 than full vaccination.</p>



<p>However, Anime NYC organizers had too few staff checking proof of vaccination outside the venue, leading to long lines and crowding outside. Some attendees waited outside up to four hours on the first day of the convention.</p>



<p>The Javits Center itself took COVID-19 seriously, partly due to its roles during the pandemic as a field hospital and then a mass vaccination site. Newly installed hospital-grade air filters throughout the building may have helped prevent transmission.</p>



<p>“All the employees at the Javits Center had to go through training,” says Gavin Macgregor-Skinner, senior director of the Global Biorisk Advisory Council, part of the worldwide cleaning industry association that certifies organizations, including the Javits Center, on preparedness for biological threats. This training included cleaning protocols and how to manage traffic through the building.</p>



<p>This venue also worked with event organizers, including the company that runs Anime NYC, to ensure they followed safety protocols. The Javits Center’s attitude was, “if you come into our house, you follow our rules,” Macgregor-Skinner says.</p>

Smith/AFP via Getty Images</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>The CDC investigation results do not mention, however, that Anime NYC was also very lucky with its timing. When this event took place, omicron hadn’t yet gotten a foothold in Manhattan. The <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/71/wr/mm7103a5.htm?s_cid=mm7103a5_w">city’s first wastewater samples containing omicron</a> were collected on November 21, the final day of the event.</p>



<p>If the same event had happened two weeks later — when omicron was raging through the city — organizers would have needed more safety measures, such as a stricter vaccination requirement and rapid testing, to achieve the same low transmission, says Ayman El-Mohandes, an epidemiologist and dean of the school of public health at the City University of New York.</p>



<h4>Heroes wear face masks</h4>



<p>A successful COVID-19–safe event requires layers of protections that align with the community that the event is serving, says Mark Billik, founder of BeCore, a marketing agency that pivoted to organizing COVID-19–safe events during the pandemic. Billik recommends that his clients tailor their COVID-19 protocols for their events and he offered suggestions for future fan conventions (see Page 25).</p>



<p>Advance communication may be particularly successful when it’s tailored to a community and drives “enthusiasm about creating a safe environment,” El-Mohandes says. For instance, the next Anime NYC could provide masks with the faces of famous anime characters or post signs that show these characters encouraging distancing and frequent handwashing.</p>



<p>Using anime characters to promote safe behaviors is an example of classical conditioning, says Wollast, the Stanford psychology researcher. In classical conditioning, people learn to associate a particular stimulus (like wearing a face mask) with an unrelated stimulus (a favorite character) to drive a particular behavior. “My heroes are wearing face masks so I should wear one too,” Wollast says.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img data-attachment-id="3112502" data-permalink="https://www.sciencenews.org/040922_anime_inline-2" data-orig-file="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/040922_anime_inline-2.jpg" data-orig-size="680,327" data-comments-opened="0" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="040922_anime_inline-2" data-image-description="" data-image-caption="&lt;p&gt;Friends shared their Artist Alley merchandise spoils at Anime NYC.&lt;/p&gt;

<h4>Safety beyond COVID-19</h4>



<p>Along with avoiding COVID-19, Anime NYC attendees who spoke to<em> Science News</em> noted that they also avoided other respiratory illnesses. “Less people have been sick that I’ve heard of this year, than any other convention that I’ve ever been to,” Daifei says.</p>



<p>Maybe a cold or flu doesn’t have to be a necessary evil of attending conventions or similar events.</p>



<p>COVID-19 safety measures probably contributed to an unusually low number of flu cases in the 2020–21 season, according to the CDC. Leaders in the events industry are considering safety measures that build on lessons from COVID-19 — such as new technologies to improve ventilation and cleaning protocols — to reduce future outbreaks of flu and other infectious diseases, according to the Global Biorisk Advisory Council.</p>



<p>Some Anime NYC attendees hope to see continued handwashing, mask use and policies that encourage people to stay home when not feeling well, long after this pandemic recedes. All these practices are “very applicable to non-COVID respiratory infections,” El-Mohandes says. Such safety practices may also make large events more inclusive for immunocompromised people, many of whom <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2022/02/covid-pandemic-immunocompromised-risk-vaccines/622094/">already had to avoid crowds for their potential to spread infection</a> before the pandemic.</p>



<p>“I feel like this is something that we can actually keep doing,” says Nicole Tan, an artist who shared a booth with Daifei at Anime NYC. The pandemic inspired a widespread realization that “we could have prevented a lot of illness if we just put our minds to it.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2022/04/06/what-leads-people-to-believe-they-have-been-abducted-by-aliens/">What leads people to believe they have been abducted by aliens?</a></h4>

              
                <p><em>By guest blogger</em> <a href="https://twitter.com/E_Barratt">Emma L. Barratt</a></p>



<p>Alien abduction stories are, at least in the West, relatively common. From as far back as the early 60s, there have been reports of people being stolen away by aliens — typically at night — often for various physics-defying experiments, before being returned home in one piece.</p>



<p>And while stories like these might strike some as delusions that would typically arise from certain mental health issues, studies <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/13546800244000058">have found</a> that abductees are no more likely than anyone else to have conditions affecting their perception of reality.</p>



<p>Thanks to psychological research over the past few decades, however, we can probably conclude that these alien mis-adventures arise due to two entirely more mundane phenomena: sleep paralysis, and false memories.</p>



<span id="more-45939"></span>



<p>Researchers have long noted the similarities between accounts of alien abduction and the relatively lesser-known phenomenon of sleep paralysis — a common condition in which the cognitive and physiological components of REM sleep become desynchronised. Those who experience sleep paralysis are essentially awake, but unable to move for a period of seconds to minutes, often reporting a rather specific set of hallucinations during their time immobile. These include flashing lights, buzzing, electrical tingling sensations, feelings of levitation, and — most unnervingly — visual hallucinations of figures hovering near their bed.</p>



<p>If one were to imagine these sensations and perceptions all together, and the absence of any knowledge about sleep paralysis, it becomes easy to see why the very remote possibility of alien abduction might feel like the only plausible answer. Even so, this doesn’t quite bridge the gap between this specific set of hallucinations and the vivid details often recalled by abductees.</p>



<p>Abductees are often said to recover memories of what happened to them, either through therapy, conversations, viewing certain media that trigger these memories, or sometimes hypnosis. This, psychologists believe, is likely to be the point at which memories of those hallucinations become unintentionally embellished by distorted recall.</p>



<p>A <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/11233172_Memory_distortion_in_people_reporting_abduction_by_aliens">2002 study</a> from academics at Harvard University and Harvard Medical School set out to probe what exactly might lead to the formation of memories of alien abduction, focusing particularly on the role of false recall and recognition</p>



<p>For their investigation, the researchers recruited volunteers “who may have been contacted or abducted by aliens” via local newspapers to participate in their memory study. These included 11 participants who had recovered memories of alien abduction, as well as 11 who believed unexplained symptoms pointed to having been abducted, but felt they had repressed memories of the event. The control group consisted of participants who did not believe they had been abducted by aliens.</p>



<p>Participants listened to audio recordings of a series of word lists, each centring around a single, non-presented “lure” word. For example, a list including words such as <em>sour</em>, <em>candy</em>, <em>sugar</em>, and <em>bitter</em> would be associated with the word <em>sweet</em>, which wouldn’t be presented. After briefly studying the list, each of the participants spent 30 seconds solving simple mathematical problems, before being asked to recall and write down as many of the presented words as possible. They were then tested to see if they recognised those previously presented words from a similar word list which also included new, semantically related words. In addition, they also completed several questionnaires probing aspects of mental health such as mood disorders, dissociative experiences, and schizotypy.</p>



<p>The results showed that those who reported recovered memories of alien abduction were more likely than controls to falsely recall and recognise the lure words, like <em>sweet</em> in the above example. Similarly, those in the &#8220;repressed memories&#8221; group were also more prone to false recall and memory distortion than controls, but to a lesser extent than those in the abductee group. Several factors associated with false recall and recognition were identified from participants’ questionnaire answers, too; namely high levels of absorption, depression, and magical ideation. Abductees also tended to score more highly in measures of dissociative experiences and PTSD symptoms.</p>



<p>In their conclusions, the researchers note that people who believe they have been abducted by aliens may have problems with source monitoring — remembering how and when a memory is acquired. For example, someone may watch a movie featuring alien abduction, or even just otherworldly creatures, and years later when assessing an episode of sleep paralysis, recall that monster and incorrectly incorporate it into their supposed abduction experience. In other words, they forget the actual source of the memory, and glue together memory fragments that seem to fit — much in the same way that abductee participants incorporated significantly more never-presented words into their recall and recognition responses.</p>



<p>So, while stories of alien abduction may not be the sign of extraterrestrial life some may hope for, at least they can provide a neat example of the power of false memory formation.</p>

                <p><em>By</em> <a href="https://twitter.com/mattbwarren">Matthew Warren</a></p>



<p>&#8220;Let me tell you about the very rich,&#8221; wrote F. Scott Fitzgerald in <em>The Rich Boy</em>. “They are different from you and me.”</p>



<p>Fitzgerald’s narrator was referring to the way wealth can shape people’s character — but a new study suggests that people with particular personalities may also be more likely to become wealthy in the first place.</p>



<p>Writing in <em>Humanities and Social Sciences Communications, </em><a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41599-022-01099-3">the team finds</a> that millionaires have a unique pattern of personality traits compared to the rest of us — and this is particularly true for millionaires who made their wealth on their own.</p>



<span id="more-45930"></span>



<p>Marius Leckelt from the University of Mainz and colleagues examined data from the German Socio-Economic Panel, an annual survey of German residents which includes a subsample of particularly wealthy individuals. The team were interested in participants’ net worth, rather than income, as they felt this provided a better measure of overall material resources. They calculated net worth based on information participants had given about their assets (property, stocks, privately-owned businesses and so on) and liabilities (mortgages, loans, etc).</p>



<p>The researchers classified people as “rich” if they had a net worth of at least €1 million, or “non-rich” if they had a net-worth of under €800,000. They also categorised participants as “self-made” if their wealth came primarily from self-employment or entrepreneurship; “inheritor” if their wealth came from gifts or inheritances; or “mixed” if they fell somewhere in the middle.</p>



<p>As part of the survey, participants had also filled in a short questionnaire looking at their Big Five personality traits, as well as a single measure of propensity for risk-taking.</p>



<p>The team found that the rich participants had a distinct personality profile from the non-rich participants: they tended to be more risk-tolerant, and were more open, extraverted and conscientious, but less neurotic. This constellation of personality traits was most prominent in the self-made rich participants, followed by those who had a mixed source of wealth; by contrast, the inheritors did not conform so well to this personality profile.</p>



<p>Within the non-rich sample, there was a small proportion of participants whose (relatively modest) wealth was classed as self-made. And, interestingly, these people showed a similar (although less pronounced) personality profile to their rich counterparts.</p>



<p>Overall, then, a personality profile consisting of heightened risk-tolerance, openness, extraversion and conscientiousness and lower neuroticism is associated with being rich. It’s not hard to see how being more diligent or willing to take risks could increase someone’s chances of becoming wealthy. But the authors point out that these traits don’t automatically lead people to a life of riches — after all, self-made participants in the non-rich group showed a similar personality profile without having a high net worth. And of course there are many other factors beyond personality that have an influence over people’s financial position.</p>



<p>The correlational design of the study also means it’s tricky to draw any definitive conclusions about cause-and-effect. It could be that being rich changes our personalities, as Fitzgerald suggested, rather than the other way around. But the authors argue that these personality characteristics do indeed seem to be a cause rather than consequence of becoming rich. That’s because this particular personality profile was much more prominent in self-made millionaires than in those who inherited wealth. If being rich was influencing people’s personalities, you’d instead expect those born into wealth to show the biggest differences in personality.</p>



<p>It remains to be seen whether there are similar differences in personality between the rich and non-rich in places outside of Germany. It’s not guaranteed that these effects apply in other countries with different cultures and economies. It would also be interesting to look at personality and accrual of wealth over time — this kind of longitudinal design could better answer the question of whether personality influences wealth, or wealth influences personality. I expect the reality is that it works both ways: after all, recent work has shown that <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2021/05/18/episode-25-how-to-change-your-personality/">our personality is much more malleable</a> than we once thought. Only future research will tell.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/racial-bias-race-us-patient-medical-notes-chart-records">Racial bias can seep into U.S. patients’ medical notes</a></h4>

              
                <p>When health care providers enter notes into patients’ electronic health records, they are more likely to portray Black patients negatively compared with white patients, two recent studies have found. The unfavorable descriptions may perpetuate bias and stigma and influence the care patients receive.</p>



<p>“The first impression is the chart,” says Gracie Himmelstein, a physician training in internal medicine at the UCLA David Geffen School of Medicine. “That narrative is going to shape your views of the patient, even if you think you’re just looking for the clinical data.”</p>



<p>Himmelstein and colleagues analyzed more than 48,000 hospital admission notes from a Boston medical center. Stigmatizing language overall, and about diabetes and substance use disorder in particular, was <a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2788454">more often used in the notes of Black patients</a> compared with white patients, the team reported January 27 in <em>JAMA Network Open</em>.</p>





<p>Another study combed through more than 40,000 medical notes from a Chicago medical center. Black patients were <a href="https://www.healthaffairs.org/doi/10.1377/hlthaff.2021.01423">more likely to be described as not complying with or resistant to treatment</a>, among other unfavorable terms, a different research group reported in the February <em>Health Affairs</em>.</p>



<p>The two studies appear to be the first to quantify racial bias in the U.S. electronic health record. Bias can drive health disparities — differences in health tied to social, environmental or economic disadvantages — that occur between different racial and ethnic groups. For example, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/black-newborn-baby-survival-doctor-race-mortality-rate-disparity">Black infants have a higher mortality rate than white infants</a> due to health disparities (<em>SN: 8/25/20</em>). &nbsp;</p>



<p>The <em>Health Affairs</em> study’s team designed a computer program to look for phrases with negative connotations, including “not compliant,” “not adherent” and “refused,” in medical notes written from January 2019 to October 2020 for close to 18,500 patients. Overall, 8 percent of the patients had one or more negative terms in their electronic health records.</p>



<p>Black patients were 2.5 times more likely to have such words in their medical notes than white patients, the researchers found. This language “has a potential for targeted harm,” says coauthor Michael Sun, a medical student at the University of Chicago’s Pritzker School of Medicine.</p>



<p>Himmelstein and colleagues scrutinized the electronic health record for negative language like “nonadherent” and “unwilling” along with stigmatizing words — including the verb “abuse” —&nbsp; that label or place blame on the patient. The team studied medical notes that were written from January to December in 2018.</p>



<p>Overall, around 1,200, or 2.5 percent, of the admission notes contained unfavorable language. Notes about substance use disorder and diabetes had more of that language woven in, at 3.4 percent and 7 percent, respectively. In the full sample, Black patients were nearly 1.3 times more likely to have stigmatizing terms in their notes than white patients. That factor was about the same when the researchers focused on diabetes notes, while for records about substance use disorder, Black patients were 1.7 times more likely to have negative descriptions.</p>



<p>The new studies didn’t assess what impact the biased notes had on patients’ medical care. But other research has found that when short descriptions of a patient include stigmatizing language, the negative terms influenced physicians’ treatment decisions, making doctors <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5910343/">less likely to offer sufficient pain medication</a>.</p>



<p>Along with potentially leading to worse care, bias in medical notes may sour patients’ perception of their providers. Patients now have the right to read their electronic health records, as mandated in the 21st Century Cures Act. Notes that include stigmatizing or biased depictions can “potentially undermine trust,” says primary care doctor and health equity adviser Leonor Fernández of Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center in Boston.</p>



<p>In a survey of nearly 23,000 patients, Fernández and colleagues found that 10.5 percent <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11606-020-06432-7">felt offended or judged, or both, after reading their own notes</a>, the team reported in the <em>Journal of General Internal Medicine</em> in September 2021. (The survey didn’t ask about discrimination or racial bias specifically.) Many respondents also explained what prompted their feelings. One participant wrote, “Note said I wasn’t doing everything I could to lose weight which was untrue and very upsetting to see my Dr thought of me like that.”</p>



<p>Researchers have written about ways to remove stigma from descriptions of <a href="https://nida.nih.gov/drug-topics/addiction-science/words-matter-preferred-language-talking-about-addiction">substance use disorder</a> and <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6232190/">obesity</a>, among other conditions. This guidance encourages language that does not identify the patient by their illness and that focuses on the efforts a patient is making.</p>



<p>Rather than labeling a person a “diabetic,” for example, health care providers can write that a person “has diabetes,” researchers from a diabetes care task force recommend. And instead of describing a patient as “non-compliant” with their medication, the researchers suggest <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/stoken/default+domain/SYRQNKSEWGKXARZUSCIJ/full">explaining why</a>, as in, the patient takes insulin “50 percent of the time because of cost concerns.”</p>



<p>By noting the barriers to a patient’s ability to follow medical advice, says Himmelstein, a health care provider can “engage with that in a way that’s actually helpful in promoting health.” Instead of using terms like “non-compliant,” Sun hopes health care providers “think about what other context and what other story” can be told about the patient.</p>



<p>Accounting for the challenges a patient faces “actually makes you more effective” as a health care provider, says Fernández, and makes the patient less likely to feel blamed.</p>



<p>In the <em>Health Affairs</em> study, Sun and his colleagues observed an unexpected and encouraging change in the electronic health record over time. For notes written during the second half of the study, from March to October of 2020, it was no longer more likely that Black patients’ notes had negative terms compared with white patients. That time period coincided with the start of the COVID-19 pandemic and Black Lives Matter protests.</p>



<p>More work is needed to sort out what’s behind the drop, says Sun. He and his coauthors note that health care providers may have considered patients with COVID-19 less responsible for their illness, in contrast to other conditions. But perhaps it has something to do with how “impactful” that period was, Sun says, in raising awareness of racial health disparities. Perhaps the shift was “out of empathy.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/star-most-distant-farthest-earendel-light-hubble">A star nicknamed ‘Earendel’ may be the most distant yet seen</a></h4>

              
                <p>A chance alignment may have revealed a star from the universe’s first billion years.</p>



<p>If confirmed, this star would be the most distant one ever seen, obliterating the <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/blog/science-ticker/most-distant-star-ever-spotted-9-billion-light-years-away">previous record</a> (<em>SN:</em> <em>7/11/17</em>). Light from the star traveled for <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-022-04449-y">about 12.9 billion years</a> on its journey toward Earth, about 4 billion years longer than the former record holder, researchers report in the March 30 <em>Nature</em>. Studying the object could help researchers learn more about the universe’s composition during that early, mysterious time.</p>



<p>“These are the sorts of things that you only hope you could discover,” says astronomer Katherine Whitaker of the University of Massachusetts Amherst, who was not part of the new study.</p>





<p>The researchers found the object while analyzing Hubble Space Telescope images of dozens of clusters of galaxies nearer to Earth. These clusters are so massive that they bend and focus the light from more distant background objects, what’s known as <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/using-general-relativity-magnify-cosmos">gravitational lensing</a> (<em>SN: 10/6/15</em>). </p>



<p>In images of one cluster, astronomer Brian Welch of Johns Hopkins University and colleagues noticed a long, thin, red arc. The team realized that the arc was a background galaxy whose light the cluster had warped and amplified. </p>



<p>Atop that red arc is a bright spot that is too small to be a small galaxy or a star cluster, the researchers say. “We stumbled into finding that this was a lensed star,” Welch says.</p>



<p>The researchers estimate that the star’s light originates from only 900 million years after the Big Bang, which took place about 13.8 billion years ago. </p>



<p>Welch and his colleagues think that the object, which they poetically nicknamed &#8220;Earendel&#8221; from the old English word meaning “morning star” or “rising light,” is a behemoth with at least 50 times the mass of the sun. But the researchers can’t pin down that value, or learn more about the star or even confirm that it is a star, without more detailed observations.</p>



<p>The researchers plan to use the <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/james-webb-space-telescope-launch-space-science-cosmos-exoplanets">recently launched James Webb Space Telescope</a> to examine Earendel (<em>SN: 10/6/21</em>). The telescope, also known as JWST, will begin studying the distant universe this summer.</p>



<p>JWST may uncover objects from even earlier times in the universe’s history than what Hubble can see because the new telescope will be sensitive to light from more distant objects. Welch hopes that the telescope will find many more of these gravitationally lensed stars. “I&#8217;m hoping that this record won&#8217;t last very long.”</p>
