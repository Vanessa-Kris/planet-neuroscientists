              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/laser-nuclear-fusion-experiment-energy">With a powerful laser blast, scientists near a nuclear fusion milestone</a></h4>

              
                <p>With a powerful laser zap, scientists have blasted toward a milestone for nuclear fusion.</p>



<p>A fusion experiment at the world’s biggest laser facility released 1.3 million joules of energy, coming close to a break-even point known as ignition, where fusion begins to release more energy than required to detonate it. Reaching ignition would strengthen hopes that fusion could one day serve as a clean, plentiful energy source, a goal that scientists <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/50-years-nuclear-fusion-still-hasnt-delivered-clean-energy">have struggled to make progress toward</a> (<em>SN: 2/8/18</em>).</p>



<p>By pummeling a tiny capsule with lasers at the National Ignition Facility, or NIF, at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory in California, scientists triggered fusion reactions that churned out more than 10 quadrillion watts of power over 100 trillionths of a second. In all, the experiment, performed August 8, released about 70 percent of the energy of the laser light used to set off the fusion reactions, putting the facility much closer to ignition than ever before.</p>



<p>Notably, because the capsule absorbs only a portion of the total laser energy focused on it, the reactions actually produced more energy than directly went into igniting them. “That, just fundamentally, is a truly amazing feat,” says plasma physicist Carolyn Kuranz of the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor, who was not involved with the research. By that metric, the fusion reactions produced about five times as much energy as was absorbed.</p>





<p>“It’s a really exciting result, and it wasn’t clear that NIF would be able to get to this result,” Kuranz says. For years, NIF scientists have strived to reach ignition, but they have been <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/ignition-failed">plagued with setbacks</a> (<em>SN: 4/4/13</em>). While the new results have yet to be published in a scientific journal, NIF scientists went public with their discovery after word got out to the scientific community and excitement mounted.</p>



<p>“It makes me very hopeful … for fusion in the future,” Kuranz says.</p>



<p>Nuclear fusion, the same process that powers the sun, would be an appealing source of energy on Earth because it checks several boxes for environmental friendliness: It wouldn’t generate climate-warming greenhouse gases or dangerous, long-lived radioactive waste. In nuclear fusion, hydrogen nuclei meld together to form helium, releasing energy in the process. But fusion requires extreme temperatures and pressures, making it difficult to control.</p>



<p>NIF is not alone in the fusion quest. Other projects, such as ITER, an enormous facility under construction in southern France, are using <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/nuclear-fusion-gets-boost-private-sector-startups">different techniques to tackle the problem</a> (<em>SN: 1/27/16</em>). But those efforts have also met with difficulties. Perhaps unsurprisingly, controlling reactions akin to those in the sun is challenging no matter how you go about it.</p>



<p>In NIF’s fusion experiments, 192&nbsp;laser beams converge on a small cylinder containing a peppercorn-sized fuel capsule. When that powerful laser burst hits the cylinder, X-rays stream out, vaporizing the capsule’s exterior and imploding the fuel within. That fuel is a mixture of deuterium and tritium, varieties of hydrogen that respectively contain one or two neutrons in their atomic nuclei. As the fuel implodes, it reaches the extreme densities, temperatures and pressures needed to fuse the hydrogen into helium. That helium can further heat the rest of the fuel, what’s known as alpha heating, setting off a fusion chain reaction.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" width="680" height="383" src="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/081821_ec_nuclear-fusion_inline1.jpg" alt="illustration of blue lasers blasting a fuel capsule" class="wp-image-3102720" srcset="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/081821_ec_nuclear-fusion_inline1.jpg 680w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/081821_ec_nuclear-fusion_inline1-330x186.jpg 330w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><figcaption><span class="caption wp-caption-3102720">In fusion experiments at the National Ignition Facility, lasers (blue in this artist’s rendering) blast a tiny cylinder containing a fuel capsule (white sphere). That process produces X-rays that vaporize the capsule’s exterior and compresses the fuel to the extreme pressures and temperatures needed to drive fusion.</span><span class="credit wp-credit-3102720">LLNL</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>That last step is crucial to boosting the energy yield. “What’s new about this experiment is that we’ve created a system in which the alpha heating rate is far larger than we’ve ever achieved before,” says NIF physicist Arthur Pak.</p>



<p>Scientists navigated a variety of quagmires to get to this stage. “There’s a whole a host of physics issues … that we’ve faced off and mitigated,” Pak says. For example, researchers took pains to make the capsule absorb more energy, to eliminate tiny defects in the capsule and to carefully tune the laser pulses to maximize fusion.</p>



<p>In 2018, researchers began seeing the payoff of those efforts. NIF achieved a then-record fusion energy of 55,000 joules. Then, in spring 2021, NIF reached 170,000 joules. Further tweaking the design of the experiment, scientists suspected, could increase the output even more. But the new experiment went beyond expectations, producing nearly eight times the energy of the previous effort.</p>



<p>Further studies will help NIF scientists determine exactly how their changes created such bountiful energy and how to enhance the output further. Still, even if NIF achieves full-fledged ignition, using fusion to generate power for practical purposes is still a long way off. “There will be a huge amount of work needed to turn the technology into a viable source of energy,” says laser plasma physicist Stuart Mangles of Imperial College London, who was not involved with the research. “Nevertheless, this is a really important milestone on the way.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/haiti-earthquake-citizen-science-seismology-risk">Haiti’s citizen seismologists helped track its devastating quake in real time</a></h4>

              
                <p>On August 14, a powerful magnitude 7.2 earthquake struck Haiti, triggering landslides, toppling buildings and killing at least 1,900 people, with over 9,000 people injured. Rescue workers are racing against time to find survivors in the rubble, hampered by heavy rains from Tropical Storm Grace that battered and flooded the country’s southern peninsula on August 16.</p>



<p>Scientists, too, are rushing to the region to learn what they can from the devastation the quake left behind, in hopes of gaining a better understanding of the seismic hazards faced by the country.</p>



<p>The epicenter of the quake was near Petit Trou de Nippes, a town on Haiti’s southern peninsula about 125 kilometers west of Port-au-Prince. The Enriquillo-Plantain Garden fault zone passes straight through that peninsula, marking where the Caribbean tectonic plate to the south grinds against the small Gonâve tectonic plate to the north. Scientists often eye this fault zone as the likely source when a deadly quake strikes Haiti, such as <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/scientists-scramble-analyze-haiti-quake">the 2010 earthquake that killed at least 200,000 people</a> (<em>SN: 1/16/10</em>).</p>



<p>But several months after that quake, scientists discovered that <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/haiti-quake-reveals-previously-unknown-fault">its origin was on a previously unknown fault</a>, near but not part of the well-known Enriquillo zone (<em>SN: 8/11/10</em>). The fault was within a region of faults not mapped before, in part due to a dearth of seismometers in Haiti. Since then, researchers have worked to increase seismic measurements and understanding of the country’s seismic hazards, including through the creation of <a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/feart.2020.542654/full">a network of volunteer “citizen seismologists</a>.” Data <a href="https://ayiti.unice.fr/sismo-ayiti/">collected by those volunteers</a> have already proved invaluable to tracking the most recent quake and its aftershocks, says geologist Dominique Boisson of the University of Haiti in Port-au-Prince.</p>





<p><em>Science News</em> talked with Boisson and geophysicist Eric Calais of the École Normale Supérieure in Paris about what we know about the new earthquake, scientists’ rapid-response efforts to map its impacts and how citizen seismologists can help. The conversation has been edited for clarity and brevity.</p>



<p><strong><em>SN</em></strong><strong>: What do we know about where exactly this earthquake occurred?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Boisson</strong>: Just after an earthquake, we have preliminary results that give you a sense of where the epicenter was. But we don’t have precise information — was it on this fault or another fault? That’s why we are doing the measurements we are doing right now.</p>



<p><strong>Calais</strong>: We should keep in mind what happened in 2010. Right after the earthquake, it was the same thing: The Enriquillo fault is the main feature there, it’s got to be that fault. Then the data started coming in, and it became more and more clear that it was not that fault that had ruptured. And in the end, it was demonstrated that it was a small, secondary fault nearby. From a geologic standpoint, that’s very common. A good example is the 1989 <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/loma-prietas-long-distance-punch">Loma Prieta earthquake </a>&nbsp;[in California] — that was not caused by the San Andreas Fault, it was triggered by a fault right next to it (<em>SN: 4/21/90</em>).</p>



<p>So are we in this situation from the earthquake of last week? The jury is still out. [This quake] seems to be shallower than the 2010 earthquake, and there’s a gap of about 50 kilometers between [where that quake and the August 14 quake occurred].</p>



<p>A question that a lot of seismologists have is what about this gap — will there be an earthquake [there]? Well, probably, but when, we don’t know. But it’s going to be an area of intense research in future years.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong><em>SN</em></strong>: <strong>What can we learn from the just-launched seismology fieldwork that researchers at the University of Haiti are doing?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Calais</strong>: It’s essential after any earthquake anywhere to be able to go to the field as quickly as possible to make a scientific assessment, of course without putting the emergency response into any difficulty. What it involves in practice is sending people to the field with instruments like seismometers and geodetic instruments [such as GPS receivers that can provide 3-D coordinates].</p>



<p><strong>Boisson</strong>: Right now, with GPS, they are going to make a survey of the position of the ground, and where it was displaced. We are going to compare these measurements with measurements [from these areas] in the past, and we will track how this movement evolves in the next weeks and months. [We’re] also sending in teams to study landslides [triggered by the quake]. So there is a lot of work to do right now.</p>



<p><strong>Calais</strong>: In the case of this earthquake, it’s particularly difficult to reach the field, but we are glad to be able to report that two of the researchers are safe in the field … [and] are deploying instruments to better understand the mechanism of the earthquake. That will be very important to assess what might be coming next, and in particular to better understand what the aftershocks are telling us.</p>



<p><strong><em>SN</em></strong>: <strong>How well are the faults of this area mapped? And how might measurements of microseisms — abundant tiny earthquakes difficult to distinguish from background noise — help to image Haiti’s subsurface?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Boisson</strong>: The big [Enriquillo] fault is well-known. But we are very far from having detailed maps of the active faults of the southern peninsula or other parts of the country. There’s a lot of work to be done to have a good map of the active faults and what is the real shape of the structures underneath.</p>



<p>With data on <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/more-million-tiny-earthquakes-revealed-southern-california">microseisms</a>, including from citizen seismologists, it will be very helpful to get this kind of information for <a href="https://seismosoc.secure-platform.com/a/gallery/rounds/12/details/5621">imaging the structures in the subsurface</a> (<em>SN: 4/18/19</em>). Even though the data [from the citizen seismologists] is not of the same quality as the professional networks, it’s very important for helping to image the structures.</p>



<p><strong><em>SN</em></strong><strong>: How important has the citizen seismology project been to tracking the recent earthquake and its aftershocks?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Calais</strong>: It has been essential. It’s just amazing how proactive the seismic station hosts have been. We call them hosts, because they host a tiny little box, about 10 centimeters by 5 centimeters by 5 centimeters. And you just connect it to power and the internet, and it provides data in real time. And then we have built a system that analyzes the data in real time and provides aftershock locations. So within 30 seconds of an aftershock, we know exactly where it happened, what was the magnitude and the depth and so on.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" width="680" height="381" src="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/081721_CG_haiti-earthquake_inline-680.jpg" alt="Steeve Symithe and Pier-Guild Mezile stand in a room with a small seismometer" class="wp-image-3102713" srcset="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/081721_CG_haiti-earthquake_inline-680.jpg 680w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/081721_CG_haiti-earthquake_inline-680-330x186.jpg 330w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><figcaption><span class="caption wp-caption-3102713">University of Haiti geophysicist Steeve Symithe (left) points to the small seismometer hosted by “citizen seismologist” Pier-Guild Mezile (right) in Jérémie, Haiti.</span><span class="credit wp-credit-3102713">E. Calais</span></figcaption></figure>



<p><strong><em>SN: </em></strong><strong>How many citizen seismologists are working with you?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Calais</strong>: We have 15 stations throughout the country, and in the epicenter area, we have six stations. And we’re deploying more as we speak. We have a new project that’s just been approved to augment the network with an additional 50 stations.</p>



<p><strong><em>SN</em></strong>: <strong>So who are these volunteers? What are some of the challenges they face in doing this work?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Calais</strong>: Their backgrounds vary — we have a public notary, we have a hotel owner, we have a civil engineer. It’s all over the map really. It’s not easy to have internet and power available all the time in Haiti — there’s no place, almost, where that’s possible. So everybody has a power generator of some kind; you buy your internet plan by the day. We had one station, the station closest to the epicenter … the host was so sorry because he had not renewed his internet plan when the earthquake happened. And right away he contacted us and said, “Well, I just ran to the internet provider and I just bought a new plan!” And his station came back online right away.</p>



<p>So it’s an amazing effort. It shows that there is really an interesting bridge to build between citizens who want to participate and want to be informed, and scientists. The data are very, very useful to us, and the interaction we’re having with the hosts is teaching us a lot also about how the risk is perceived and what kind of message [about potential seismic hazards] is useful.</p>



<p>The message of a seismologist is a very technical one, and so how do we convey a message that is actionable, that makes sense to the people who receive it? We’re not trained for that, and we need to learn from our audience what they need.</p>



<p><strong><em>SN</em></strong>: <strong>In 2020, you (Calais and Boisson) and your colleagues published a preliminary report on the citizen seismology project, calling it a socio-seismology experiment. How might this work improve earthquake awareness and potentially reduce risks from these hazards?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Calais</strong>: It’s a very interesting endeavor because it’s not only seismology that we’re interested in. It’s a project that we’re conducting with sociologists and anthropologists. The project is too young to be able to tell whether it has made any difference in the level of preparedness. But right now are we are trying to organize a team of sociologists to send into the field to interview people and build a baseline of information about how risk is perceived. We don’t have that. It’s a shame that we tend to send emergency response, seismologists and so on, [but] we don’t think so much about sending sociologists.</p>



<p>After the 2010 earthquake, which was really a dramatic experience for a lot of people, there was no baseline study that was done right after. So you come back 10 years later, and you can’t tell a difference between how the risk is perceived. So we’re trying to change that.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/extreme-heat-climate-change-human-behavior-aggression-equity">How extreme heat from climate change distorts human behavior</a></h4>

              
                <p>On a sweltering summer afternoon almost a decade ago, Meenu Tewari was visiting a weaving company in Surat in western India. Tewari, an urban planner, frequently makes such visits to understand how manufacturing companies operate. On that day, though, her tour of the factory floor left her puzzled.</p>



<p>“There were no workers there … only machines,” says Tewari of the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.</p>



<p>The missing employees weren’t far away; they were resting in the shade under a nearby awning. Scorching temperatures had been causing workers to make mistakes or even faint near the dangerous machinery, Tewari’s guide told her. So the company had mandated that workers come in earlier and leave later so that they could rest during the midday heat.</p>



<p>Physiologically, people’s <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/climate-deadly-extreme-temperature-predictions-already-here">bodies aren’t built to handle heat</a> beyond wet bulb temperatures — a combined measure of heat and humidity — of around 35° Celsius, or about 95° Fahrenheit (<em>SN: </em><em>5/8/20</em>). Mounting evidence shows that when heat taxes people’s bodies, their performance on various tasks, as well as overall coping mechanisms, also suffer. Researchers have linked extreme heat to increased aggression, lower cognitive ability and, as Tewari and colleagues showed, lost productivity.</p>



<p>With rising global temperatures, and <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/pacific-northwest-heat-wave-climate-change-things-to-know">record-breaking heat waves</a> baking parts of the world, the effects of extreme heat on human behavior could pose a growing problem (<em>SN: 6/29/21</em>).</p>

<p>And lower-income people and countries, with limited resources to keep cool as climate change warms the world, are likely to suffer the most, researchers say. &nbsp;“The physiological effects of heat may be universal, but the way it manifests … is highly unequal,” says economist R. Jisung Park of UCLA.</p>



<h4>Heat and aggression</h4>





<p>Scientists have been documenting humans’ difficulties coping with extreme heat for over a century. Much of that work, however, has taken place in laboratory settings to allow for a high degree of control.</p>



<p>For instance, a few decades ago, social psychologist Craig Anderson and colleagues showed undergraduates four video clips of couples engaged in dialog. One clip was neutral in tone, while the remaining three showed escalating tension between the duo. The undergraduate students watching the clips were each sitting in a room with the thermostat set to one of five different temperatures, ranging from a cool 14° C to a hot 36° C. The researchers then asked the students to score the couples’ hostility level. Anderson, now of Iowa State University in Ames, found that students in uncomfortably warm rooms scored all the couples, even the <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0065260100800040">neutral one, as more hostile</a> than students in rooms with comfortable temperatures did. (Interestingly, students in uncomfortably cold rooms also scored the couples as more hostile.)</p>



<p>Heat tends to make people more irritable, says Anderson, whose findings appeared in the 2000 <em>Advances in Experimental Social Psychology. </em>And as a result, “they tend to just perceive things as being more nasty when they’re hot than when they’re comfortable.”</p>



<p>Research suggests that such perceptions can give way to actual violence when people lack an escape hatch. But this “heat-aggression hypothesis” has been hard to demonstrate outside the lab because teasing out the effect of heat from other environmental or biological variables linked to aggression is tricky in the messy real world. Studies in the last few years, however, have started confirming the idea. &nbsp;</p>

<h3>Fueling crime</h3>



<p>Researchers have long known that people can become more aggressive when overheated. A new study looking at crime data in Los Angeles from 2010 to 2017 shows that violent crime rises when temperatures exceed a pleasant 65° to 70° Fahrenheit.</p>

<p>For instance, a July working paper out of the National Bureau of Economic Research came close to re-creating the level of control found in a lab by focusing on inmates in Mississippi prisons and jails that lack air conditioning. Economists Anita Mukherjee of the University of Wisconsin–Madison and Nicholas Sanders of Cornell University looked at rates of violence across 36 correctional facilities from January 1, 2004, to December 31, 2010. Overall, each facility averaged about 65 violent acts per year. But the pair found that on days above around 27° C — which occur about just over 60 days per year — the probability of <a href="https://www.nber.org/papers/w28987">violence among inmates rose 18 percent</a>. &nbsp;</p>



<p>Though that doesn’t seem that hot, most of those days of had an average maximum temperature of roughly 34° C; nor do those temperature readings account for Mississippi’s high humidity, Mukherjee says. Moreover, many of the country’s aging correctional facilities lack both air conditioning and proper ventilation, and temperatures inside the facilities often exceed temperatures outside.</p>



<p>Politicians often frame providing inmates with air conditioning as a matter of comfort, Mukherjee says. “When we’re talking 120-plus degrees [Fahrenheit] inside a prison for many days a year, it becomes a moral issue.”</p>



<p>Extrapolating from the Mississippi data, Mukherjee and Sanders estimate that heat generates an additional 4,000 violent acts each year in U.S. correctional facilities.</p>



<p>Research also suggests that violence spikes alongside heat outside of prisons. For instance, for the months May to September from 2010 to 2017, <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S004727272100044X">violent crime in Los Angeles was about 5.5 percent higher</a> on days with temperatures from about 24° C to 32° C (75° to 89° F), compared with days below those temperatures, researchers reported in the May <em>Journal of Public Economics</em>. Violent crime was almost 10 percent higher on even hotter days, the researchers found.</p>



<h4>Heat and performance</h4>



<p>The relationship between heat and human behavior extends well beyond violence. Consider students taking exams in hot school buildings. Park, the UCLA economist, zoomed in on students in New York City sitting for standardized subject-specific high school exams. Each take about three hours and are administered at the student’s home school for a two-week period at the end of June. Temperatures at that time can vary from 15° C to almost 37° C.</p>



<p>Park looked at scores for almost 1 million students and about 4.5 million exams from 1999 to 2011. That analysis, appearing March 2020 in the <em>Journal of Human Resources, </em>found that students who take the exam on an approximately 32° C day are <a href="http://jhr.uwpress.org/content/early/2020/03/03/jhr.57.2.0618-9535R3">10 percent less likely to pass</a> a given subject than if they had taken that exam on a 24° C day. &nbsp;</p>



<p>Park and colleagues also looked at how hot temperatures might affect students’ performance across the country. This time, they zoomed in on the PSAT, a standardized exam administered to high schoolers in October that measures college readiness and provides a pathway to scholarships. The team evaluated 21 million scores from nearly 10 million students who took the exam at least twice from 1998 to 2012. That way, the researchers could compare how students performed relative to themselves. The team also correlated exam scores with daily temperature data from around 3,000 weather stations across the country, as well as information about each student’s access to air conditioning.</p>



<p>Student scores typically increase between the first time they take the exam and the second. But even when the researchers factored in that rise, students in schools without air conditioning scored lower than would have been expected, the researchers reported in the May 2020 <em>American Economic Journal: Economic Policy</em>. What’s more, Black and Hispanic students were more likely to attend school and test in hotter buildings than their white counterparts, and the researchers estimate that the resulting temperature differences <a href="https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257%2Fpol.20180612">explained 3 to 7 percent of the PSAT’s racial achievement gap.</a></p>



<p>That sort of performance decline doesn’t just happen in academic settings; it extends to the workforce too. Following Tewari’s visit to the weaving factory in Surat, she began combing through data on worker output in India — where industrial air conditioning can be rare — at several weaving and garment sewing factories and a steel company that supplies rails for railways.</p>



<p>Tewari and colleagues observed workers from roughly one to nine years, depending on the industry. When temperatures climbed beyond 35° C,&nbsp;average&nbsp;daily production in weaving dropped by about 2 percent and garment sewing by as much as 8 percent, compared with days under 30° C, the researchers estimate in the June <em>Journal of Political Economy</em>.</p>



<p>The team then scaled up to industries across India using national survey data. That analysis showed that productivity started dropping when average daily maximum temperatures rose above 20° C. The researchers’ calculations suggest that <a href="https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/10.1086/713733">average annual output will decrease by 2.1 percent if average daily temperatures warm by 1 degree C</a> over current conditions; annual gross domestic product, or the value of goods and services produced in a single year, would drop by 3 percent.</p>



<p>The takeaway: Extreme heat hurts some countries’ bottom line, Tewari says.</p>





<h4>Universal air conditioning?</h4>



<p>The burdens of high heat are often borne by a country’s poorest residents. For instance, in the United States, a long legacy of discriminatory housing policies means poor people often live in the hottest parts of a city, a July report from Climate Central, an independent climate science research and communications organization, notes. In these concentrated pockets of heat, called “urban heat islands, <a href="https://medialibrary.climatecentral.org/uploads/general/2021_UHI_Report.pdf">midafternoon temperatures can rise by 8° to 11° C</a> above outlying areas. The effects tend to be worse in poor neighborhoods due to high density, limited green space and shade and an abundance of paved roads and surfaces that absorb rather than reflect heat.</p>



<p>Similarly, in that study linking intense heat to violent crime spikes in Los Angeles, researchers found strong geographic differences. “Beverly Hills doesn’t have much violent crime on any of those days. But in the poorest communities in Los Angeles, you see a larger correlation between heat and violence,” says environmental economist Matthew Kahn of the University of Southern California in Los Angeles. Compared with wealthier city residents, poor people in Los Angeles have less space and far fewer air conditioning units, Kahn adds.</p>



<p>Given these inequities, the simplest choice is to provide everyone with air conditioning, Kahn says. But cooling buildings is far from free. Cooling equipment, including primarily air conditioners, accounted for about <a href="https://wedocs.unep.org/bitstream/handle/20.500.11822/33094/CoolRep.pdf?sequence=1&amp;isAllowed=y">17 percent of the world’s total electricity demand</a> in 2018, according to a 2020 United Nations report. Estimates suggest that air conditioning use in emerging economies alone will lead to 33 times as much energy consumption by the year 2100. And, at the moment, most of that energy comes from nonrenewable sources, chiefly oil, coal and gas, so meeting that demand would contribute to global warming. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>The choice over whether or not to install an air conditioning unit in a given facility, as with many things, comes down to relative costs and benefits, Tewari says. Even with soaring temperatures, air conditioning entire factories remains more expensive than giving workers midday siestas or selectively air conditioning only those rooms where precision is most required.</p>



<p>Moreover, better cooling options exist, say Tewari and others, including <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/are-we-ready-deadly-heat-waves-future">maintaining or increasing tree cover in cities and using “cool” building materials</a> that reflect sunlight (<em>SN: </em><em>4/3/18</em>). &nbsp;</p>



<p>“Air conditioning is not sustainable,” Tewari says. “There are urban planning mechanisms through which you can reduce ambient temperatures.”</p>



<p>But Kahn says poor people deserve access to air conditioning. The long-term solution is not to keep overheating the poor, but to expedite efforts to green the energy grid, he says. “The poor have the least capacity to adapt. In a fair society, I hope we don’t just shrug at that fact.”</p>

                <p><em>By </em><a href="http://emilyoliviareynolds.com/">Emily Reynolds</a></p>



<p>From <a href="https://www.designboom.com/architecture/space-iconic-landmarks-mexico-city-google-office-03-21-2014/">ball pits</a> to <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/3f23e63b-8768-441d-abc7-68e27ca6feed">free beers</a>, fun job perks have received plenty of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2014/oct/19/working-for-tech-companies-quirks-of-the-job?CMP=twt_gu">press attention</a> over the last few years. For millennials, such benefits should surely be appealing — they are, after all, the generation these perks were ostensibly designed for.</p>



<p>But according to a new study, young people themselves have a different priority in the workplace — respect. <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/23294884211016529">Writing in the <em>International Journal of Business Communication</em></a>, a team led by Danielle LaGree from Kansas State University finds that being valued and respected by managers was the key factor in employees’ ability to positively adapt to the workplace. And, in turn, this impacted how loyal workers were to their employers, how much they engaged in their work, and how happy they felt overall.</p>



<span id="more-43238"></span>



<p>Participants were 1,036 adults aged 21 to 34, all of whom were in full time employment. First, participants answered questions about “respectful engagement” at their workplaces — the extent to which colleagues express appreciation and respect for each other’s work, emphasise each other’s good qualities, and speak to each other in a respectful way. Next, they completed a measure of how they felt they were judged by bosses or supervisors, indicating how much they agreed with statements like “my boss values what I contribute to work” and “my boss appreciates my unique contributions to the job”.</p>



<p>Occupational resilience was measured next, with participants agreeing or disagreeing with statements related to the way they handle setbacks at work, as well as how satisfied they felt at work in general. Participants also indicated how much they wanted to remain at their current company in the future, and how engaged they were at work, responding to statements including “I strive as hard as I can to complete my job”, “I feel positive about my job” and “I pay a lot of attention to my job”.</p>



<p>Those who felt they were respected and valued both by colleagues and by bosses were more likely to experience occupational resilience — that is, they were more able to deal with the challenges of the workplace. In turn, greater occupational resilience led these people to say they were more likely to want to stay employed at their company, and more willing to engage with their roles.</p>



<p>There was no difference by gender or ethnicity of participants, though there were different outcomes based on field: those working in computing reported significantly more respectful engagement at work than those working in retail, healthcare, education or sales.</p>



<p>Together, the results show that having supportive colleagues and supervisors can increase employees’ job satisfaction and engagement, and make them more likely to retain their position — and it seems that this is because a supportive environment creates employees who are able to deal with the trials and tribulations of the workplace. The team suggests that these findings could be a useful tool — training bosses in particular how to communicate respectfully, for example, could make for happier, more satisfied workplaces with employees who are unlikely to seek new work.</p>



<p>Looking explicitly at other perks and benefits could provide additional insight. To what degree do perks mitigate disrespectful workplaces, if at all? Overall, however, the results suggest that workplace happiness is mostly dependent on fundamental principles of respect and appreciation. They, more than free beers or ball pits, are likely to define employees’ experiences.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/wildflower-carnivore-plant-sticky-hair-insect-trap">A well-known wildflower turns out to be a secret carnivore</a></h4>

              
                <p>Gleaming, gluey, deathtrap hairs have betrayed the secret identity of a well-known wildflower: It’s a carnivore.</p>



<p>A species of false asphodel (<em>Triantha occidentalis</em>) uses enzyme-secreting hairs on its flowering stem to <a href="https://www.pnas.org/content/118/33/e2022724118">snare and digest insects</a>, researchers report in the Aug. 17 <em>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences</em>. Scientists have known about<em> T. occidentalis</em> since the 19th century, but its taste for meat has gone undetected until now.</p>



<p>Sticky hairs by themselves aren’t unusual — many noncarnivorous plants use them to defend against pests<em>. </em>But <em>T. occidentalis</em> has qualities that some meat-eating plants share: a love of bright, boggy, nutrient-poor habitats and the absence of a gene that fine-tunes how plants get energy from light. Together, those features felt like pieces of a jigsaw puzzle hinting at carnivory, says botanist Sean Graham of the University of British Columbia in Vancouver.</p>



<p>To solve the puzzle, Graham and colleagues needed to know if the wildflower pulls nutrients from insect corpses. Luckily, <em>T. occidentalis</em> grows along North America’s West Coast, from Alaska to California, and can be found on hikes near Vancouver. “They’re right on our doorstep,” Graham says.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" width="680" height="454" src="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/081221_jc_carnivorous-plant_inline1.jpg" alt="bugs stuck to stems of Triantha occidentalis wildflowers" class="wp-image-3102665" srcset="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/081221_jc_carnivorous-plant_inline1.jpg 680w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/081221_jc_carnivorous-plant_inline1-574x383.jpg 574w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/081221_jc_carnivorous-plant_inline1-674x450.jpg 674w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/081221_jc_carnivorous-plant_inline1-279x186.jpg 279w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><figcaption><span class="caption wp-caption-3102665">Experiments confirm that <em>Triantha occidentalis </em>wildflowers are carnivorous, getting nutrients from insects that get caught in their sticky stem hairs (shown).</span><span class="credit wp-credit-3102665">Qianshi Lin</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>The team attached fruit flies fed with nitrogen-15, an isotope that can be used to track changes in nitrogen levels, to the flowering stems of bog-dwelling <em>T. occidentalis</em> plants in British Columbia’s Cypress Provincial Park. Over half of the wildflowers’ nitrogen came from the fruit flies, the team found. Those levels are comparable to known carnivorous plants. What’s more, the wildflowers’ sticky hairs oozed phosphatase, a digestive enzyme that many carnivorous plants secrete to consume prey.</p>



<p>Most of the world’s roughly 800 meat-eating plant species <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/blog/wild-things/pollinators-venus-flytrap-plants">set traps and flowers far apart</a> to avoid killing pollinating visitors (<em>SN: 2/6/18</em>). <em>T. occidentalis</em> bucks that trend. “Putting your traps close to your flowers is, on the surface, a really big conflict,” Graham says. But the plant’s hairs may be just sticky enough to catch small flies and beetles without entrapping bigger pollinators such as bees and butterflies.</p>



<p><em>T. occidentalis’</em> sticky hairs might also hint at how some meat-eating plants evolved. In nutrient-poor soils, it may have been advantageous for some plants to co-opt hairs for carnivory, Graham says. “The insects are being trapped anyway, so might as well use them.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/covid-coronavirus-aerosol-droplets-airborne-evolution">New studies hint that the coronavirus may be evolving to become more airborne</a></h4>

              
                <p>Small aerosol particles spewed while people breathe, talk and sing may contain more coronavirus than larger moisture droplets do. And the coronavirus may be evolving to spread more easily through the air, a new study suggests. But there is also good news: Masks can help.</p>



<p>About 85 percent of coronavirus RNA detected in COVID-19 patients’ breath <a href="https://academic.oup.com/cid/advance-article/doi/10.1093/cid/ciab691/6343417">was found in fine aerosol particles</a> less than five micrometers in size, researchers in Singapore report August 6 in <em>Clinical Infectious Diseases</em>. The finding is the latest evidence to suggest that COVID-19 is spread mainly through the air in fine droplets that may stay suspended for hours rather than in larger droplets that quickly fall to the ground and contaminate surfaces.</p>



<p>Similar to that result, Donald Milton at the University of Maryland in College Park and colleagues found that people who carried the <a href="https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.08.13.21261989v1">alpha variant had 18 times as much viral RNA in aerosols</a> than people infected with less-contagious versions of the virus. That study, posted August 13 at medRxiv.org, has not been yet been peer reviewed. It also found that loose-fitting masks could cut the amount of virus-carrying aerosols by nearly half.</p>

<p>In one experiment, the Maryland team grew the virus from the air samples in the lab. That could be evidence that may convince some reluctant experts to embrace the idea that the virus spreads mainly through the air.</p>



<p>The debate over aerosol transmission has been ongoing since nearly the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic. Last year, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/covid-19-coronavirus-airborne-aerosol-transmission">200 scientists wrote a letter to the World Health Organization</a> asking for the organization to acknowledge aerosol spread of the virus (<em>SN: 7/7/20</em>). In April, the <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coronavirus-covid-air-spread-indoor-clean-ventilation-filtration">WHO upgraded its information</a> on transmission to include aerosols (<em>SN: 5/18/21</em>). The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention had acknowledged aerosols as the most likely source of spread just a few weeks before.</p>



<p>Previous studies in monkeys have also suggested that more virus ends up in aerosols than in large droplets. But some experts say that direct evidence that the virus spreads mainly through the air is still lacking.</p>



<p>“There’s lots of indirect evidence that the airborne route — breathing it in — is dominant,” says Linsey Marr, a civil and environmental engineer at Virginia Tech in Blacksburg, who studies viruses in the air. She was one of the 200 scientists who wrote to the WHO last year. “‘Airborne’ is a loaded word in infection control circles,” she says, requiring health care workers to isolate patients in special rooms, wear protective equipment and take other costly and resource-intensive measures to stop the spread of the disease. For those reasons, infection control experts have been reluctant to call the coronavirus airborne without especially strong proof.</p>



<p>Most COVID-19 cases have been among close household contacts — typically within the 6-feet splash zone of large droplets. It can be hard to tease out whether such infections were passed on by large droplet contamination or by breathing the same air. But for other situations, such as when patrons get infected while sitting across a restaurant from someone with COVID-19, aerosols are really the only explanation, Marr says.</p>



<p>Mechanical engineer Kwok Wai Tham of the National University of Singapore set out to sample how much virus COVID-19 patients produce when they breathe, talk or sing, in part, to address skeptics’ concerns. “I’m doing this to convince some very close friends,” he says. He and colleagues rolled a mobile lab into 22 patients’ rooms and had volunteers stick their heads into a large metal cone.</p>





<p>The researchers collected both aerosols and larger droplets that the patients exhaled while breathing quietly for 30 minutes, while repeating passages from Dr. Seuss’ <em>Green Eggs and Ham</em> for 15 minutes, or while singing simple tunes like the “Happy Birthday” song, “Twinkle, Twinkle Little Star” or the “ABCs” for 15 minutes. The scientists tested both aerosols and large droplets in the air samples for coronavirus RNA and calculated how many copies of the virus’s nucleocapsid protein gene, or N gene, were present. That gives an estimate of how much virus is in a sample.</p>



<p>Of the 22 patients who sang for science, only 13 spewed forth detectable levels of viral RNA. In general, singing created the most virus-laden aerosols, but some people generated more while talking. Those differences might be attributable to the volume at which volunteers sang, Tham says. “Some people were shy and sang softer. Others were quite uninhibited.” &nbsp;</p>



<p>The overall amount of virus that people produced varied widely. Scientists already knew that some people are more likely to spread the virus than others, including some people involved in <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coronavirus-covid-19-case-clusters-lessons-warnings-reopening">superspreading events</a> (<em>SN</em><em>: 6/18/20</em>). In this new study, the differences weren’t due to symptoms — some asymptomatic people made more virus than those with fevers, coughs or runny noses.</p>



<p>Only one factor stood out as affecting the amount of virus emitted. People who were earlier in the course of infection tended to produce more virus, the researchers found. That agrees with data from lab animal studies and other human studies suggesting that people are <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coronavirus-most-contagious-before-during-first-week-symptoms">most contagious in the first week</a> after catching the coronavirus (<em>SN: 3/13/20</em>).</p>



<p>So far, Tham’s skeptical virologist friends aren’t convinced that he’s demonstrated that aerosol transmission is the major route of COVID-19 spread. “They say, ‘we need the golden evidence. Show me a live virus that is retrieved from the air,’” Tham says.</p>



<p>Viral RNA could be debris from dead viruses that can’t cause infection, says Andrew Pekosz, a virologist at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health who was not involved in either study. “In the absence of infectious virus, the significance of aerosols on transmission is still a bit unclear.”</p>

<p>The study from the Maryland group may provide that evidence. In that study, people with asymptomatic or mild coronavirus cases recited the ABCs, shouted “Go Terps!” (the Maryland mascot) or sang “Happy Birthday” into a similar device. In this study, the infected people did the activities once while wearing a mask and once while not wearing one.</p>



<p>About 45 percent of fine aerosol particles contained viral RNA, as did 31 percent of coarse aerosols larger than 5 micrometers and 65 percent of droplets called fomites collected from swabs of the volunteers’ mobile phones, the researchers found.</p>



<p>In addition, the increased amount of alpha variant in aerosols may suggest that the coronavirus is evolving toward more efficient airborne spread, the researchers propose. The study was done from May 2020 to April 2021, before the delta variant began its surge in the United States.</p>



<p>Researchers were able to grow infectious virus from two of 66 aerosol samples, both collected while people were wearing masks. None of the coarse aerosols or fomites yielded any infectious virus.</p>



<p>Although the Maryland group used an efficient way to look for infectious virus in aerosols, it was still rare to find them, Pekosz says. “It would be difficult to make the case that this was what is responsible for increased spread of alpha.”</p>



<p>But Marr says the data do suggest the coronavirus is evolving toward more efficient spread through the air. Although the study involved only four patients infected with alpha, those people consistently released more virus than people infected with other variants. “These results combined with epidemiological observations about the spread of alpha, and now delta, support the idea that these variants are supercharged when it comes to aerosol transmission,” she says.</p>



<p>The masks volunteers wore in the Maryland study were mostly loose-fitting. They ranged from a single-layer homemade cloth mask early on and progressed over the course of the study to double-layer commercially made cloth masks, to double masks, surgical masks and one KN95 mask by the end. On average, the masks reduced the number of virus-containing, coarse aerosols produced by 77 percent compared with no mask. And virus-laden fine aerosols were reduced an average of 48 percent, though the reduction ranged from 3 percent to 72 percent. Masks performed equally well against the alpha variant as for other variants. &nbsp;Previous studies have suggested that <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/double-mask-fit-reduce-coronavirus-exposure-covid-19-pandemic">well-fitting masks — ones that seal tightly to the face and don’t leave gaps at the tops, bottoms or sides for the virus to pass unfiltered — may reduce coronavirus exposure by 96 percent</a> if everyone is wearing them (<em>SN: 2/12/21</em>).</p>



<p>The latest results suggest that masks can help reduce the amount of virus people give off, though the coronavirus can still escape if the face coverings are worn loosely. “With the dominance of newer, more contagious variants than those we studied, increased attention to improved ventilation, filtration, air sanitation, and use of high-quality tight-fitting face masks or respirators … will be increasingly important for controlling the pandemic,” the researchers wrote. That’s especially important in places with low vaccination rates.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/sunbirds-feathers-iridescence-heat-light">Sunbirds’ dazzling feathers are hot, in both senses of the word</a></h4>

              
                <p>For sunbirds, all that shimmers is piping hot.</p>



<p>The birds’ flashy, iridescent feathers heat up more than other types of feathers, possibly making it harder to stay cool in hot, sunny conditions. If so, <a href="https://royalsocietypublishing.org/rsif/doi/10.1098/rsif.2021.0252">the colorful plumes may be costly ornaments for luring mates</a>, researchers report August 4 in the <em>Journal of the Royal Society Interface</em>. </p>



<p>Many studies on the thermal properties of animal color have previously focused on differences between how dark and light colors derived from pigments react to light and heat, says Svana Rogalla, a biophysicist at the Biofisika Institute in Bilbao, Spain. Less attention has been paid to how heat interacts with structural color — often vibrant, iridescent hues created by light refracting off of microscopic structures. These structures are found in everything from the scales of <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/deep-sea-worms-elvis-species">deep-sea worms</a> (<em>SN</em>: <em>5/25/20</em>) to <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/tiny-structures-give-peacock-spider-its-radiant-rump">spiders</a>’ exoskeletons (<em>SN</em><em>: 9/9/16</em>).&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>In the new study, Rogalla and colleagues turned to sunbirds, nectar-feeding birds typically smaller than sparrows that are native to Africa, Asia and Australia. Sunbirds have feather colors that come from a mix of sources, including pigments like fiery carotenoids and dark melanin as well as iridescent structural color.&nbsp;</p>





<p>The researchers examined 15 sunbird species preserved at the Field Museum in Chicago, heating the specimens under a lamp that mimics sunlight and then measuring the surface temperatures of feathers and the preserved birds’ skin.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Iridescent feathers heated up more than feathers that had only pigment-based colors, the team found. In breast feathers, for example, iridescent feathers averaged about 74° Celsius at the feather surface after a few minutes of light exposure, where feathers with yellow to red carotenoid pigments reached just over 63° C. This heat transferred to the skin, too, with skin under iridescent feathers growing about 5 degrees C and 8 degrees C hotter than skin under feathers with olive or yellow to red pigments.</p>



<p>Light scattering off of microscopic layers of air, the protein keratin and melanin-containing structures called melanosomes creates iridescent feathers’ sheen. But the plentiful melanin also makes the feathers absorb more solar radiation than other lighter-colored, less melanin-rich feathers, Rogalla says, which contributes to heating.</p>



<p>What’s more, high-powered microscopes and heat simulations showed that melanosomes’ arrangement in an iridescent feather⁠ encourages heat absorption. Melanosomes in a dark, noniridescent feather sit relatively disorganized in layers. But the melanosomes in the stacked, microscopic structures that produce iridescence are more organized and densely packed. Iridescent feathers likely heat up more than black feathers because those shimmering plumes have more melanosomes over a given feather area, Rogalla says.</p>



<p>The shape of the melanosomes may make a difference too. Iridescent feathers tend to have plate-shaped melanosomes, with rod-shaped ones in black feathers and spherical ones in gray feathers. The team’s simulations showed plate-shaped melanosomes heating up more than the other two shapes.</p>

Those feathers absorb more light than other feather types, possibly making it harder to stay cool.</span><span class="credit wp-credit-3102575">Svana Rogalla</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>Iridescence is more pronounced in male sunbirds than females and is used in courtship displays. Rogalla wonders if the flashy colors, by possibly contributing to heat stress, create an evolutionary conflict between mating and staying cool, or thermoregulating. “It could be a trade-off,” she says, “being very colorful to attract females, but then you have a cost when you sit in the sun when it’s hot.”</p>



<p>Allison Shultz, an ornithologist at the Natural History Museums of Los Angeles County in California who was not involved with this research, says the flashy plumage may act as a signal demonstrating a male bird’s relative vigor and resilience.&nbsp;“Maybe it shows [females] that males are able to deal with this higher heat load by having iridescent colors.”</p>



<p>Still, there’s a big caveat to the experimental setup. The study’s results may be “difficult to put in perspective” because the experiments were conducted on dead birds, says Vinod Kumar Saranathan, an evolutionary biologist at Yale-NUS College in Singapore.&nbsp;“You don’t have the benefit of the live bird [to evaluate], manipulating its body and doing various things to actively thermoregulate.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Sunbirds can release heat by panting or changing feather positions. And the birds rarely stay in the sun for long, Saranathan says, explaining that they dart from flowers in sunny areas to more shaded forest. If iridescent feathers lose heat as quickly as they acquire it, the sunbirds could use shade to cool off, blunting the effect of the hot plumage.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Iridescence has evolved so many times independently across the [bird evolutionary tree],” Saranathan says. If shiny feathers were particularly burdensome to birds, he says, that repeated evolution wouldn’t be likely.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Even so, the findings have implications for how iridescence could contribute to heat effects from climate change. Rogalla points out that small birds like sunbirds — vulnerable to big swings in ambient temperatures — have already perished en masse from extreme heat events. Such instances of mass death have occurred among Australian parrots, for example, where intense heat waves have killed <a href="https://www.smh.com.au/national/heatwave-kills-hundreds-of-birds-in-wa-20090113-7g1f.html">hundreds of budgerigars</a> and scores of <a href="https://www.publish.csiro.au/pc/PC110141">cockatoos</a> in recent years. With their hot feathers, iridescent sunbirds may be especially at risk.</p>



<p>A warming climate may force iridescent birds to be active for shorter amounts of time during hot days to avoid the additive impact of solar heating, Saranathan says.&nbsp;If so, he adds, such a truncated schedule may increase competition for food in the precious remaining active hours.</p>

<p><a href="https://bookshop.org/a/21798/9780262046121">Bright Galaxies, Dark Matter, and Beyond</a><br><em>Ashley Jean Yeager</em><br><em>MIT Press, $24.95</em></p>



<p>Vera Rubin’s research forced cosmologists to radically reimagine the cosmos.</p>



<p>In the 1960s and ’70s, Rubin’s observations of stars whirling around within galaxies revealed the gravitational tug of invisible “dark matter.” Although astronomers had detected hints of this enigmatic substance for decades, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/new-observatory-named-after-dark-matter-pioneer-vera-rubin">Rubin’s data helped finally convince</a> a skeptical scientific community that dark matter exists (<em>SN: 1/10/20</em>).</p>



<p>“Her work was pivotal to redefining the composition of our cosmos,” Ashley Yeager, <em>Science News</em>’ associate news editor, writes in her new book. <em>Bright Galaxies, Dark Matter, and Beyond</em> follows Rubin’s journey from stargazing child to preeminent astronomer and fierce advocate for women in science.</p>





<p>That journey, Yeager shows, was rife with obstacles. When Rubin was a young astronomer in the 1950s and ’60s, many observatories were closed to women, and more established scientists often brushed her off. Much of her early work was met with intense skepticism, but that only made Rubin, who died in 2016 at age 88, a more dogged data collector.</p>





<p>On graphs plotting the speeds of stars swirling around galaxies, Rubin showed that stars farther from galactic centers orbited just as fast as inner stars. That is, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/century/wild-universe-einstein-general-relativity-spacetime">the galaxies’ rotation curves were flat</a>. Such speedy outer stars must be pulled along by the gravitational grip of dark matter.</p>



<p><em>Science News </em>staff writer Maria Temming spoke with Yeager about Rubin’s legacy and what, beyond her pioneering research, made Rubin remarkable. The following discussion has been edited for clarity and brevity.</p>



<p><strong>Temming: What inspired you to tell Rubin’s story?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Yeager: </strong>It all started when I was working at the National Air and Space Museum in Washington, D.C., in 2007. I was walking around the “Explore the Universe” exhibit and noticed there weren’t many women featured. But then there was this picture of a woman with big glasses and cropped hair, and I thought, “Who is this?” It was Vera Rubin.</p>



<p>My supervisor was a curator of oral histories. He was working on Rubin’s, so I asked him about her. He said, “I have one more oral history interview to do with her. Would you like to come?” So I got to interview her. She was charismatic, kind and curious — not a person who was all about herself, but wanted to know about you. That stuck with me.</p>



<p><strong>Temming: You spend much of the book describing evidence for dark matter besides Rubin’s research. Why?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Yeager: </strong>I wanted to make sure I didn’t portray Rubin as this lone person who discovered dark matter, because there were a lot of different moving pieces in astronomy and physics that came together in the ’70s and early ’80s for the scientific community to say, “OK, we really have to take dark matter seriously.”</p>



<p><strong>Temming: What made Rubin’s work a linchpin for confirming dark matter?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Yeager: </strong>She really went after nailing down that flat rotation curve in all types of galaxies. Mainly because she did get a lot of pushback, continually, that said, “Oh, that’s just a special case in that galaxy, or that’s just for those types of galaxies.” She studied hundreds of galaxies to double-check that, yes, in fact, the rotation curves are flat. People saying, “We don’t believe you,” didn’t ever really knock her down. She just came back swinging harder.</p>



<p>It helped that she did the work in visible wavelengths of light. There had been a lot of radio astronomy data to suggest flat rotation curves, but because radio astronomy was very new, it was really only once you saw it with the eye that the astronomy community was convinced.</p>



<p><strong>Temming: Do you have a favorite anecdote about Rubin?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Yeager: </strong>The one that comes to mind is how much she loved flowers. She told me about how on drives from Lowell Observatory to Kitt Peak National Observatory in Arizona, she and her colleague Kent Ford would always stop and buy wildflowers. The fact that picking these wildflowers stuck with her, I thought, was just representative of who she was. Her favorite moments weren’t necessarily these big discoveries she’d made, but stopping to pick some flowers and enjoy their beauty.</p>

<p><strong>Temming: Did you learn anything in your research that surprised you?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Yeager: </strong>I didn’t initially grasp how many different types of projects she had. She did a lot with looking for larger-scale structure [in the universe] and looking at the <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/fast-radio-bursts-universe-expansion-hubble-constant">Hubble constant</a> [which describes how fast the universe is expanding] (<em>SN: 4/21/21</em>). She had a very diverse set of questions that she wanted to answer, well into her 70s.</p>



<p><strong>Temming: I was surprised by her decision to get out of the rat-race of hunting for quasars, when that area of research heated up in the 1960s.</strong></p>



<p><strong>Yeager: </strong>She very much didn’t like to be in pressure situations where she could be wrong. She liked to go and collect so much data that no one could [dispute it]. With quasar research, it was just too fast, and she wanted to be methodical about it.</p>



<p><strong>Temming: Why is Rubin’s story important to tell now?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Yeager: </strong>Unfortunately for women and minorities in science, it’s still very relevant, in that there are a lot of challenges to pursuing a career in STEM. Her story demonstrates that you have to surround yourself with people who are willing to help you and get away from the people who want to keep you down. Plus her story is also very encouraging: Your curiosity can keep you going and can fuel something way bigger than yourself.</p>



<p><strong>Temming: How did she advocate for women in astronomy?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Yeager: </strong>She was very outspoken about it. At National Academy of Sciences meetings, the organizers always dreaded her standing up, because she would say, “What are we doing about women in science? We’re not doing enough.” She was constantly pushing for women to be recognized with awards. She kept tabs on the number of women who had earned Ph.D.s and who had gotten staff positions — and their salaries. She was very data-driven. She’d cull that information and use it to advocate for better representation and recognition of women in astronomy.</p>



<p><strong>Temming: How would you describe Rubin to someone who hasn’t met her?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Yeager: </strong>She was one of the most persistent, gracious and nurturing people that I’ve ever met. You could strip away all that she did in astronomy and she would still be this incredible figure — the way she carried herself, the way she treated people. Just a beautiful human being.</p>

                <p><em>By</em>&nbsp;<a href="https://emmayoung.net/">Emma Young</a></p>



<p>No one likes the sound of someone else chewing or drinking. But for some people, it’s enough to cause overwhelming feelings of anger or disgust — and in some cases, send them into a violent rage. People with &#8220;misophonia&#8221; (literally a hatred of sounds) over-react to some common everyday &#8220;trigger sounds&#8221; — typically, sounds made by another person. Though the <a href="https://allergictosound.com">phenomenon has been well documented</a>, exactly what causes it hasn’t been clear. Now a <a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/content/jneuro/41/26/5762.full.pdf">new paper</a> in the <em>Journal of Neuroscience</em> provides a compelling explanation: that misophonia isn’t related to hearing so much as to an &#8220;over-mirroring&#8221; of someone else’s physical actions. The team, led by Sukhbinder Kumar at Newcastle University, thinks that this excessive mirroring causes anger in some sufferers, and anxiety and distress in others.</p>



<span id="more-43233"></span>



<p>So-called &#8220;mirror neurons&#8221; in the premotor cortex were first discovered in monkeys. Groups of these neurons fire when a monkey either performs a specific action, like opening a peanut shell, or watches another monkey doing the same action. This system is thought to aid learning from others, and also the coordination of actions, so that a troop can hunt together effectively, for example. In people, there is evidence for mirror systems for movement and also emotion. (I should note, though, that some researchers <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2019/03/25/there-is-only-weak-evidence-that-mirror-neurons-underlie-human-empathy-new-review-and-meta-analysis/">dispute the strength of this evidence</a>.)</p>



<p>Misophonia has been thought of as a disorder of sound emotion processing — that sufferers over-react emotionally to trigger sounds. However, Kumar and his colleagues observed that most trigger sounds involve physical movements of the mouth and face. They wondered whether this might be important for understanding the disorder.</p>



<p>The team used fMRI to look at activity in the brains of 33 people with and without misophonia while they were in a &#8220;resting state&#8221; — when they were not actively engaged in doing anything in particular. They also analysed existing fMRI data on 42 people with and without misophonia while they listened to three categories of sounds: known trigger sounds (including gulping, slurping, eating food and sniffing); other generally unpleasant sounds (such as the sound of a baby crying or a dentist’s drill); and neutral sounds (like rain or a helicopter).</p>



<p>A number of intriguing differences emerged between sufferers vs non-sufferers. While in a resting state, people with misophonia showed stronger functional connectivity between the auditory and visual cortex and the ventral premotor cortex (functional connectivity is a measure of how closely correlated brain activity is in different regions). This latter region includes the orofacial motor area, which is responsible for movements of the face and mouth region. While listening to sounds of any kind, people with misophonia also showed stronger connectivity between the auditory cortex and the orofacial motor area. Finally, in response to known trigger sounds, they showed stronger activation of the orofacial motor area.</p>



<p>The fact that the misophonia group showed differences specifically involving facial motor regions points to misophonia being caused by aberrations in the motor mirror system — by excessive mirroring of someone else’s facial movements — rather than abnormal sound processing, per se. “Our results support a model of misophonia based on ‘hyper-mirroring’ of the orofacial actions of others with sounds being the ‘medium’ via which action of others is excessively mirrored,” the team explains.</p>



<p>It’s a fascinating idea. And it sits neatly with other work on different kinds of hyper-mirroring, such as &#8220;<a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2017/11/20/whats-different-about-the-brains-of-the-minority-of-us-who-feel-other-peoples-physical-pain/">mirror pain</a>&#8221; and &#8220;<a href="https://banissylab.com/mirror-touch/">mirror touch</a>&#8220;. However, people with these conditions <em>feel </em>at least some pain or touch when they see someone else being hurt or being touched, and these experiences don’t tend to make them angry. Why would hyper-mirroring of someone else’s mouth movements make misophonia sufferers so distressed, or induce rage?</p>



<p>The team suggests that if they’re not aware of what’s actually going on (and mirror pain would be a lot more noticeable than facial movement mirroring), someone with misophonia could experience a sense of a loss of control over their own actions and goals. “Since anger can be described as perceived goal interference, the drive to imitate others would make anger (or aggression) the dominating emotional response,” the team writes.</p>



<p>Clearly, there&#8217;s more to explore here. But this new conception of misophonia could have immediate practical impacts. For some sufferers and their families, misophonia is a very serious problem. It can lead to social isolation and even suicide. If sufferers could be trained to associate trigger sounds with the sound sources rather than orofacial movements specifically, perhaps this might work as an effective treatment.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/medieval-grave-finland-warrior-nonbinary-person-gender">A 1,000-year-old grave may have held a powerful nonbinary person</a></h4>

              
                <p>For decades, a roughly 1,000-year-old grave in southern Finland has been thought to have held a powerful woman who might have been a warrior. But an individual who was biologically male may have actually have been interred there, researchers now say. And there are signs that this person was perhaps a respected individual with a nontraditional gender identity.</p>



<p>Discovered in 1968 at a site known as Suontaka, the Finnish grave held a largely decomposed human skeleton. Only two leg-bone fragments were successfully excavated. The grave also included jewelry traditionally associated with women and two swords, including one with a bronze hilt, typically attributed to men. Items in the Suontaka grave date to the latter part of Finland’s early medieval period, between 1050 and 1300.</p>



<p>Now, an analysis of a tiny amount of nuclear DNA extracted from a leg-bone fragment suggests that the grave held an individual born with an extra X chromosome, say archaeologist Ulla Moilanen of the University of Turku in Finland and colleagues. Symptoms of this condition in present-day males, known as <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/klinefelter-syndrome/symptoms-causes/syc-20353949">Klinefelter syndrome</a>, include low testosterone, lack of facial and body hair, enlarged breasts and learning and language-related problems. Effects of this rare condition on growth and appearance range from mild to noticeable.</p>



<p>That genetic evidence, combined with the unusual mix of male- and female-related items in the grave, suggests that the grave held an individual who was nonbinary, Moilanen’s group says. Gender identity refers to a person’s concept of self as male, female, a blend of both or neither. It often, but not always, coincides with a person’s biological sex. Nonbinary individuals have gender identities that are not strictly male or female.</p>





<p>Even in early medieval societies that emphasized masculinity and warfare, some individuals who didn’t fit community expectations about how males and females should behave may have been <a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/european-journal-of-archaeology/article/woman-with-a-sword-weapon-grave-at-suontaka-vesitorninmaki-finland/33A89DB1D7E4900F017833D87C997D3D">interred in ways that commemorated their nontraditional social gender identities</a>, the scientists conclude July 15 in the <em>European Journal of Archaeology</em>.</p>



<p>“This burial [at Suontaka] has an unusual and strong mixture of feminine and masculine symbolism, and this might indicate that the individual was not strictly associated with either gender but instead with something else,” Moilanen says.</p>



<p>The nature of that alternative gender identity remains a mystery. Further complicating matters, early medieval gender identities may have been shaped by poorly understood social and community forces, not personal choices, Moilanen says.</p>



<p>Men today vary greatly in their responses to Klinefelter syndrome, says psychologist Chris Kraft, codirector of clinical services at the Johns Hopkins School of Medicine Sex and Gender Clinic. Some develop nontraditional gender identities, while others express confusion about their gender identity. But many men with Klinefelter syndrome adopt a traditional gender identity for their biological sex. Reasons for these differences are poorly understood.</p>



<p>“It’s hard to know how someone in early medieval Finland would have reacted to having Klinefelter syndrome,” Kraft says.</p>



<p>Intriguingly, though, the Suontaka individual not only had a likely case of Klinefelter syndrome but was also buried with that curious mix of male and female items. Moilanen’s group studied 23 animal hairs and three bird feather fragments retrieved from soil that had been excavated with the leg-bone fragments. Based on that evidence, the Suontaka individual was likely dressed in feminine clothes made of sheep’s wool and furs from animals that included rabbits or hares, the researchers say. Bird feathers came from a pillow or bedding, which along with brooches placed in the grave were associated with females, the researchers suspect.</p>



<p>But in a move closely tied to early medieval ideas about masculinity, a hiltless sword was apparently placed on top of the man’s body at the time of burial. A fancier sword with a carved bronze hilt was probably placed next to the body later, perhaps to show continuing respect for the Suontaka individual, the investigators suggest.</p>

<p>The new study plausibly suggests that the Suontaka grave held a respected person who had neither a typical male nor female sense of their social gender identity, says archaeologist Marianne Moen of the University of Oslo, who was not part of Moilanen’s group.</p>



<p>But even if a woman had been placed in the grave with swords and jewelry, the evidence would indicate that some individuals with outside-of-the-box identities — such as a woman who viewed herself as biologically female but socially male according to conventions about warriors at the time — were respected in early medieval Finland and perhaps elsewhere in Scandinavia, Moen adds.</p>



<p>Other researchers have controversially proposed that an approximately 1,000-year-old grave in Sweden held the remains either of <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/skeleton-ignites-debate-over-whether-women-were-viking-warriors">a Viking warrior woman</a> or a woman buried with the apparel and weapons of a warrior (<em>SN: 9/13/17</em>).</p>



<p>Rare instances in Scandinavia of early medieval graves containing men who were buried with jewelry and other feminine items have been difficult to interpret. Perhaps the closest parallel to the Suontaka individual is a man who was interred at Vivallen, Sweden, nearly 1,000 years ago with attire of both high-ranking males and females, as well as jewelry and a small knife, Moilanen says. Some researchers suspect that this man was a ritual specialist, since there is evidence that shamans dressed in women’s clothes in early medieval Scandinavia.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/jupiter-aurora-poles-super-heat-upper-atmosphere">Jupiter’s intense auroras superheat its upper atmosphere</a></h4>

              
                <p>Jupiter’s upper atmosphere is hundreds of degrees warmer than expected. After a decades-long search, scientists may have pinned down a likely source of that anomalous heat. The culprit, a new study suggests, is the planet’s intense auroras, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/auroras-electrons-space-magnetic-field-waves-earth">Jupiter’s version of Earth’s northern and southern lights</a> (<em>SN: 6/8/21</em>).</p>



<p>The temperature of the upper atmosphere of Jupiter, which orbits an average distance of 778 million kilometers from the sun, should be about –73° Celsius, says James O’Donoghue, a planetary scientist at the JAXA Institute of Space and Astronautical Science in Sagamihara, Japan. That’s largely due to the feeble illumination of the sun there, which amounts to less than 4 percent of the energy per square meter that hits Earth’s atmosphere. Instead, the region several hundred kilometers above the planet’s cloud tops has an average temperature of about 426° C.</p>



<p>Scientists first noticed this mismatch more than 40 years ago. Since then, researchers have come up with several ideas about where the upper atmosphere’s thermal boost might originate, including pressure waves or gravity waves created by turbulence lower in the atmosphere. But observations by O’Donoghue and his colleagues now provide convincing evidence that the auroras pump heat throughout the planet’s upper atmosphere.</p>



<p>The researchers used the 10-meter Keck II telescope atop Hawaii’s dormant Mauna Kea volcano to observe Jupiter on one night each in 2016 and 2017. Specifically, the team looked for infrared emissions that betray the presence of positively charged hydrogen molecules (H<sub>3</sub><sup>+</sup>). Those molecules are created when charged particles in the solar wind, among other sources, slam into the planet’s atmosphere at hundreds or thousands of kilometers per second, painting polar auroras.</p>





<p>Measuring the intensities of these molecules’ infrared emissions let the team pin down how hot it gets high above the cloud tops. In those polar regions, <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-021-03706-w">temperatures in the upper atmosphere likely top out at about 725° C</a>, the team reports in the Aug. 5 <em>Nature. </em>But at equatorial latitudes, the team’s heat map showed that the temperature falls to about 325° C. That pattern of a gradual drop-off in temperature toward lower latitudes bolsters the notion that Jupiter’s auroras are the source of anomalous heat in the upper atmosphere and that winds disperse that warmth from the polar regions.</p>



<p>One of the nights the team observed Jupiter — January 25, 2017 — was particularly well-timed because Jupiter was experiencing a strong solar flare at the time. Besides an intense aurora, data revealed a broad swath of warmer-than-normal gases at mid-latitudes, which the researchers interpret as a wave of warmth rolling southward. “It was pure luck that we captured this potential heat-shedding event,” says O’Donoghue.</p>



<p>The team’s observations “are close to a ‘smoking gun’ for the redistribution of auroral energy,” says Tommi Koskinen, a planetary scientist at the University of Arizona in Tucson. The next challenge, he notes, is to understand the underlying mechanisms of heat production and heat transfer and to then incorporate them into researchers’ simulations of Jupiter’s atmospheric circulation.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/probiotics-lab-coral-heat-stress-death-reef-survival-ocean-warming">Probiotics help lab corals survive deadly heat stress</a></h4>

              
                <p>Warming seas threaten to turn coral reefs from kaleidoscopes of color into bleached fields of rubble. To stop this degradation, some scientists are exploring a surprising salve: probiotics.</p>



<p>Dosing corals with a mix of beneficial bacteria <a href="https://advances.sciencemag.org/lookup/doi/10.1126/sciadv.abg3088?_ga=2.77567516.861410186.1628708147-402785923.1584982368">staved off death</a> in a heat wave simulated in an aquarium, researchers report August 13 in <em>Science Advances</em>. In comparison, nearly half of corals given a benign saline solution instead did not survive those same conditions. The research offers a proof of concept that probiotics could help some corals survive heat stress.</p>



<p>“The results are incredibly promising,” says Blake Ushijima, a microbiologist at the University of North Carolina Wilmington who wasn’t involved in the research. The work lends legitimacy to using probiotics as coral medicine, he says, “but we’re just scratching the surface. We don’t understand how a lot of these beneficial microbes work.”</p>



<p>Corals are not singular entities, but coalitions of cooperative players. Center stage are the photosynthetic algae that harness the power of the sun, providing energy to their animal host, the coral polyp. Scores of bacteria live in the coral too, many supporting their host by cycling nutrients or fighting pathogens. Collectively referred to as the coral “holobiont,” corals and their microbial partners form the bedrock of one of the most biodiverse ecosystems on the planet.</p>





<p><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/ocean-heat-waves-are-becoming-more-common-and-lasting-longer">Worsening marine heat waves</a> are testing the integrity of healthy holobionts (<em>SN: 4/10/18</em>). Under heat stress, corals’ algae spew toxic chemicals, prompting polyps to kick them out. This process, known as bleaching, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/reef-rehab-could-help-threatened-corals-make-comeback">can kill corals</a> (<em>SN: 10/18/16</em>). For example, bleaching from a 2016 heat wave wiped out <a href="https://coast.noaa.gov/states/fast-facts/coral-reefs.html">29 percent</a> of shallow water corals in the northern Great Barrier Reef. Bacterial communities shift under heat stress too, disrupting the benefits some bacteria provide.</p>



<p>“Overall, we see a breakdown of symbiotic relationships, and all the microorganisms start to struggle,” says Raquel Peixoto, a marine ecologist at King Abdullah University of Science and Technology in Thuwal, Saudi Arabia. She and her colleagues previously showed that treating corals with carefully concocted probiotic cocktails <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41396-018-0323-6">could mitigate coral bleaching</a> in lab experiments. That’s good, she says, “but we wanted to find out if we can protect them against mortality.”</p>

Her research focuses on treating heat-stressed corals with probiotics.</span><span class="credit wp-credit-3102647">Helena Villela</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>In the most recent setup, the researchers simulated a marine heat wave across 10 aquaria, each with four fragments of&nbsp;<em>Mussismilia hispida</em> stony corals, turning up the temperature to 30° Celsius for 10 days before returning it to 26°C. Half the corals were squirted with six bacterial strains from <em>M. hispida</em> every three days during the heat wave and every five days afterward, while the other half got a saline treatment. Over the course of 75 days, Peixoto and her colleagues measured coral health and changes in the holobiont’s metabolic activity, along with which genes got turned on and off.</p>



<p>Corals in both groups bleached, but the probiotic treatment ultimately worked. While 40 percent of saline-treated corals succumbed to the heat, all corals bathed in bacteria survived. “That was surprising and super exciting,” Peixoto says. The probiotic seems to aid the recovery of corals by inducing genetic and metabolic changes in the host that are associated with tamping down inflammation and allowing damaged cells to rebuild themselves, the researchers found.</p>



<p>“Climate change is affecting corals faster than they can adapt,” but their microbial partners can respond to changes more quickly, says Kimberly Ritchie, a marine biologist at University of South Carolina Beaufort who wasn’t involved in the research. &nbsp;Such changes, which probiotic treatments could induce, might “buy corals more time,” she says.</p>



<p>Peixoto and her colleagues plan to move beyond the aquarium, starting experiments in mid-August in to see whether probiotics can help wild corals. But some scientists are skeptical of the added bacteria’s ultimate utility, especially for large reefs that boast hundreds of coral species. “Probiotics are sexy right now,” says Ty Roach, a molecular ecologist at the Hawaii Institute of Marine Biology in Kaneohe. “I can imagine scenarios where this would be a great approach… but I don’t think they’re going to save the reefs.”</p>



<p>For example, applying probiotics to large reefs that boast hundreds of coral species seems logistically challenging, Roach says. And there could be unintended consequences. “What’s good for one coral may not be good for other corals or organisms,” Roach says. “For ecosystems as complex as coral reefs, I can’t see doing this on a large scale without having some unforeseen, potentially harmful, effects.”</p>



<p>Peixoto says that the probiotics used here are carefully screened and no strains known to be harmful to life are used. Overall, probiotics “aren’t going to be a silver bullet,” she says. The only thing that will save the reefs is mitigating carbon dioxide emissions to reduce global warming. “But we still need restoration and rehabilitation to cope with the reality that we have now,” she says, and probiotics show promise.</p>

Kristen Brown said: “This image represents both the beauty and bounty of our oceans as well as the spiraling crisis unfolding within the marine environment. Coral reefs with high coral cover and plentiful fish populations like this one at Heron Island on the Great Barrier Reef are sadly becoming rarer. Without a concentrated effort to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and improve water quality, coral reefs as we know them are at risk of disappearing within our lifetime.” Senior Editorial Board Member Josef Settele recommended the entry, saying: “Marine biodiversity sustains life and the health of our planet, but human activities are threatening the well-being of the world’s oceans. Kristen Brown’s striking image is a symbol for the need for concentrated efforts to manage biodiversity loss and set conservation priorities.”</p>
<p><b>Runner Up and Best Image for ‘</b><b>Evolutionary Developmental Biology and Biodiversity’ </b><b><img class="fr-dib" src="https://hive.springernature.com/serve/AMIfv96FQxjmwhtipjHzUUgmrWjV8j2JVpuDaMRGAMUgXAQKXHv0om-jFvg5A4yN5gL6NGrH9Lsfbv9zBylVGgKHFo8TRJNOo_rrH9A4Jr9NTpSryT4wyva81D5bNZB4YLGGe1O46KFutHYhdkjZi2gJhqjQYCxDkQ=s1600" /></b></p>
<p>Our runner up and best image for this category was submitted by Kseniya Vereshchagina, an ecologist who studies Lake Baikal in south-eastern Siberia. Lake Baikal is one of the oldest and deepest lakes in the world, giving rise to rich and particularly unique freshwater fauna. However, Kseniya explains that in areas of heavy industry and active tourism, &#8220;there is a significant impact on coastal communities.&#8221; Kseniya and her lab group at Irkutsk State University found that in areas of intense human activity, the immunity of endemic amphipod crustaceans is weakened, making them more susceptible to parasitic infection. Kseniya tells us that this image shows &#8220;an endemic amphipod crustacean densely covered with an overgrown colony of parasitic ciliates.&#8221; Lake Baikal holds exceptional scientific value to ecologists and evolutionary biologists. Such research highlights the need to minimize the impact of human activity on this precious site.</p>

<p>This stark winning image for the &#8216;Behavioral Ecology category&#8217; was submitted by an evolutionary biologist and conservation photographer affiliated with the University of Valencia, Spain. Roberto tells us that “Spiders are one of the most sophisticated hunters on earth. Nevertheless, they cannot escape from what evolution has provided to other species. In particular, some groups of wasps are specialized in hunting spiders and use them as a trophic resource for their larvae. I found this epic scene in a wall of a biological station in Tiputini, Ecuador.”</p>
<p><strong>Population Ecology</strong></p>

Roberto said: “Thousands of soldier termites are able to migrate in a complex social environment where each individual has its own mission framed altogether in a global objective: the survivorship and reproduction of the colony. In this case, these termites used meters of an abandoned rope to move across the Malaysian forest. Once humans disappear, nature recovers its space and uses what is needed to survive.”</p>
<p><strong>Human Evolution and Ecology</strong></p>

Primates can be useful models to study the evolution of human locomotion.<b> </b>To caption this winning image, Roberto García-Roa’s writes, “To understand our present and predict our future, humans aim to gain enough knowledge to fill the gap of our past. Bipedalism, for example, is probably one of the most critical steps in our evolutionary history. How did it happen? With just a few seconds to capture this scene in France, I was allowed to photograph how a baboon Papio learnt to walk on two legs in a project that aims to investigate how bipedalism evolved in hominids.”</p>
<p><strong>Ecological Developmental Biology</strong></p>

Mammals cannot repair severe damage to tissues &#8211; a severed limb does not grow back. However, zebrafish have a spectacular ability to regenerate various tissues after traumatic injury. Chey tells us that &#8220;This image shows the blood vessels in a regenerated zebrafish tail fin two weeks after clipping at the horizontal white line. Whether regeneration is a primitive or adaptive trait to environmental conditions is the subject of much debate, and the mechanisms underlying the regeneration process are not yet fully understood. Transgenic zebrafish, such as the line used to generate this image, are an important tool to help us better understand why some animals have the power of regeneration by allowing the visualization of certain cell types labelled by fluorescent reporters.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>Editor&#8217;s Pick</strong></p>

Giant Gladiator Frogs have been previously observed escaping from the jaws of snakes by emitting distress calls, jumping and inflating their lungs, making it harder for small snakes to hold on to them.</p>

                <p><em>By</em> <a href="https://emmayoung.net/">Emma Young</a></p>



<p>As children head back to school, teachers and parents will of course be concerned about kids catching up on their education after the Covid-19 lockdowns. But, as <a href="https://thepsychologist.bps.org.uk/child-play-priority-after-lockdown">many psychologists have pointed out</a>, they <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/341992762_Impact_of_COVID-19_Restrictions_on_Young_Children's_Play_Learning_Development_Preliminary_Findings_from_the_Play_and_Learning_in_the_Early_Years_PLEY_Survey">need to catch up on play</a>, too. So what does the research tell us about the need for and the importance of play?</p>



<span id="more-43228"></span>



<p><strong>First: why do kids need to play?</strong></p>



<p>Well, of course, it’s fun — and as we all know, having fun is critical for kids’ psychological wellbeing. But there are also all kinds of <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2021/04/13/episode-24-how-children-learn-through-play/">documented developmental benefits</a>. For example, play helps children learn how to interact successfully with others and to get better at regulating their emotions. Kids also learn through play: <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2021/04/13/episode-24-how-children-learn-through-play/">as we discussed in our recent podcast</a>, it helps them to develop concepts and skills, including mathematical concepts and problem-solving, and to stretch each other. If they are running around and navigating obstacles (even if those obstacles are just other kids), it also <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2021/04/01/we-have-many-more-than-five-senses-heres-how-to-make-the-most-of-them/">trains their senses —&nbsp;especially proprioception and their vestibular senses</a>. For all sorts of reasons, it’s vital. In fact, the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child states clearly that “<a href="https://ipaworld.org/childs-right-to-play/uncrc-article-31/un-convention-on-the-rights-of-the-child-1/">every child has the right… to engage in play</a>”. In <a href="https://theconversation.com/four-ways-children-say-their-well-being-can-be-improved-104195">one pre-Covid-19 survey</a>, children in Wales were asked what they would change to make themselves healthier and happier — and more time and space to play and feel safe was a top response.</p>



<p><strong>Don’t drop afternoon breaks</strong></p>



<p>Many UK schools have now shortened or even dropped afternoon break-times, replacing them with extra teaching time instead. Given the reduced teaching during lockdowns, more schools may find it tempting to lose that break. But there’s evidence that this would harm children’s wellbeing. The <a href="https://happen-wales.co.uk">HAPPEN (Health &amp; Attainment of Pupils in a Primary Education Network) project </a>on children aged 9 &#8211; 11 in Wales found that those who had afternoon breaks were physically fitter, for example, and, notably, they did no worse in Key Stage 2 tests than children who’d instead been taught during this time. Physical activity doesn’t have to be restricted to break time and PE lessons, however. A <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2018/05/30/win-win-physically-active-academic-school-lessons-boost-pupils-activity-levels-and-focus/">preliminary trial on 8- and 9-year-olds in 10 London schools</a> found that those in active maths and English lessons — in which they ran on the spot, for example, while answering questions — were more focused in the class.</p>



<p><strong>There are other benefits to playing outside</strong></p>



<p>For one, as supported by a recent paper in <em>Scientific Reports</em>, the <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-021-85825-y">increase in myopia (short-sightedness) in many countries has been linked to reduced time spent outdoors in childhood</a>. Regular playtimes in green spaces, such as parks, are also associated with <a href="https://iaap-journals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1758-0854.2011.01052.x">milder symptoms for kids with ADHD</a>. And there could ultimately be environmental &nbsp;benefits from kids spending longer outside, too: work led by Catherine Broom at the University of British Columbia, Canada, has linked <a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/australian-journal-of-environmental-education/article/abs/exploring-the-relations-between-childhood-experiences-in-nature-and-young-adults-environmental-attitudes-and-behaviours/029FC630519229DA5744DBFC257C0EA1">time spent outdoors in childhood to a love of nature and concern for the environment </a>in young adulthood.</p>



<p><strong>Make &#8220;enhanced&#8221; pretend play part of the curriculum?</strong></p>



<p>Periods of time devoted to imaginative play are common in preschools and in classes of younger school children. Certainly, they give kids the opportunity to learn how to interact well with others. But Édouard Gentaz at the University of Geneva and colleagues wondered whether teacher-guided pretend play sessions that focused more explicitly on social and emotional development might have extra benefits. <a href="https://bpspsychub.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/bjop.12484">They recently ran a study involving classes of 5 &#8211; 6 year-olds</a> in Valais, Switzerland. Some of these children got 11 hour-long weekly play sessions guided by a teacher who had been trained to encourage them to pretend to be bursting with joy, for example, or who challenged them to solve a dispute, while the others had non-guided pretend play sessions. The team found that the children who’d been guided were better at recognising emotions and had a bigger emotional vocabulary. Whether or not that translates into better interpersonal skills is not yet clear. A more extensive trial is now underway, again in the region of Valais.</p>



<p><strong>Don’t panic about newly aggressive pretend play</strong></p>



<p>After the pre-Easter lockdown, my 10-year-old came home with all kinds of stories of playground bust-ups. I’m sure the same thing happened in every school. After so long in isolation, it’s no wonder that some kids struggled with managing anger. For a minority, though, this is an ongoing problem. And a <a href="https://bpspsychub.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/bjdp.12352">recent study</a> led by Zhen Rao of the Centre for Research on Play in Education, Development and Learning at the University of Cambridge found something really interesting about the impact on classmates.</p>



<p>The team observed children aged 7 to 10 in China while they played with toys in pairs. (The toys were &#8220;neutral&#8221;; there were no toy guns, for example.) The results showed that when a child was paired with one who was deemed by fellow classmates to be bad-tempered, that first child was 45% more likely to introduce aggressive themes into their joint play. The child’s own temperament didn’t seem to influence this — it was to do with who they were with.</p>



<p>A lot of research on aggression in play has focused on potential associations with the child’s own temperament. But the study suggests that kids use play as a safe context in which to explore how to best handle an aggressive person in real life. For some children, then, aggression-themed play may not be a sign that they struggle to &#8220;play nicely&#8221; with other kids, but rather a sign of social-emotional learning.</p>



<p>All of this work argues that as our children go back to school, teachers should keep sight of what of course they know to be true — that play time as well as study is vitally important — while parents can ensure that children get as much play, and especially outdoor play, as possible.</p>

<p>As fall approaches, many parents and teachers hope to leave Zoom school behind and have kids return to the classroom. But the exceptionally transmissible delta variant threatens to dash these hopes as schools scramble to prepare. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention advises that schools employ a suite of COVID-19 mitigation measures, including social distancing, masking for all students and teachers, improving air filtration and testing students regularly.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Testing, in particular, “is a way we can spend money to reduce transmission while maintaining in-person school time,” says Alyssa Bilinski, an infectious disease modeler at Brown University in&nbsp;Providence, R.I. “It’s a flexible tool that can be scaled up or down depending on the on-the-ground situation, and it can both stop transmission and provide real-time, school-specific information that can inform decision making.”</p>



<p>While some coronavirus outbreaks did occur in schools during the last school year, transmission was usually <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/science/science-briefs/transmission_k_12_schools.html">equal to or lower than community levels</a> of the virus, especially when schools had mitigation measures in place, the CDC says. Now, as pandemic fatigue calcifies, many school districts are under pressure to remove measures like masking or social distancing or testing, even as the <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/cdc-covid-coronavirus-masks-indoors-vaccinated-people-pandemic">delta variant</a> drives a nationwide surge in COVID-19 cases (<em>SN: 7/27/21</em>).</p>

<h3>COVID-19: Back to school</h3>



<p>This story is one in a series looking at what to expect as U.S. children return to in-person school.</p>

<p>A layered approach that incorporates all of these mitigation measures is best, but with delta, “testing is going to be even more critical” in schools, says Gigi Gronvall, an immunologist at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security in Baltimore.</p>



<p>In a perfect world, all students could be tested each day with a free test that instantly revealed, with 100 percent accuracy, whether they were infected, Gronvall says. But such tests do not exist, and schools have limited budgets and bandwidths to create perfect protocols. Instead, districts will need to weigh trade-offs among different coronavirus tests, and balance frequency and scope of testing to fit schools’ needs.</p>



<p>Here’s a look at some of the testing strategies that schools are using and their inherent benefits and challenges.</p>



<h4>When tests are pooled</h4>



<p>Last February, Northborough-Southborough public schools in eastern Massachusetts started a new routine. Once a week, thousands of students (with parental consent) swabbed their noses at home, stuck the swab in a plastic baggie and brought it to school. There, swabs were pooled into groups of 16 and shipped off to a nearby lab, where technicians combined material from the swabs in each group for individual PCR tests.</p>



<p>Laboratory <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coronavirus-covid-19-college-university-campus-cases-testing">PCR, or polymerase chain reaction, tests</a> can detect bits of coronavirus genetic material in samples, and represent the gold standard of diagnostic testing (<em>SN: 2/23/21</em>). A PCR test will almost never say someone without the coronavirus has it — what’s known as a false positive — but can miss infections, perhaps <a href="https://journals.asm.org/doi/10.1128/JCM.00995-20">10 to 20 percent</a> of the time. Still, it’s the most accurate test currently in use, though that performance comes at the price of time and money.</p>



<p>Combining individual samples into pools, as Northborough-Southborough public schools did, is one cost-saving strategy. For example, if a pooled sample tested negative, the school system saved about $240 per pool each week by not having to test all 16 students individually with a $16 test. If a sample was positive, the lab then tested each swab to see who had the virus.</p>



<p>The strategy offers a relatively simple and cost-effective way to screen Northborough-Southborough’s approximately 4,100 students while still catching infections, says Mary Ellen Duggan, the school system’s director of health and wellness. A similar scheme will be implemented this year.</p>



<p>Theoretically, some pooled testing strategies can identify up to <a href="https://stm.sciencemag.org/content/13/589/eabf1568">20 times as many true positives</a> as testing individual students, given a limited testing budget, researchers reported April 14 in <em>Science Translational Medicine</em>. With only so many dollars to spend, pooled testing can cover a larger population of people, catching infections that might otherwise be missed by using that same budget to only test individual swabs.</p>



<p>Northborough-Southborough schools had all individual swabs tested if a pool turned positive, but other schools have employed different protocols. “Some just send everyone home and say go get tested,” Gronvall says. “There’s a lot of flexibility.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>For pooled testing to work, buy-in from students is crucial. In Northborough-Southborough schools, peak participation rates were about 60 percent, on average. When students tested positive, nurses at the school would scramble to call the children and instruct them to isolate, and identify and call their contacts too, a practice known as <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/covid-19-coronavirus-u-s-contact-tracing-end-social-distancing">contact tracing</a> (<em>SN: 4/29/20</em>).</p>



<p>“To get this program up and running was a full-time job,” Duggan says, but it paid off. Overall, Northborough-Southborough schools saw very few cases, a result of the full suite of mitigation strategies that the schools employed, Duggan says.</p>



<p>But pooled testing has downsides. Not all schools have easy access to labs capable of running PCR tests. If administrators can have the tests run, it can still take a couple of days to get results back and then even more time to do contact tracing, ample opportunity for infected students to spread the virus. This might prove especially problematic with the delta variant, which may <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/cdc-covid-coronavirus-masks-indoors-vaccinated-people-pandemic">spread much sooner after infection</a> (<em>SN: 7/27/21</em>).</p>

<p>For speedier information, some schools have instead opted to use rapid antigen tests, which don’t quite match a PCR test’s ability to <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coronavirus-covid19-rapid-tests-rna-virus">identify only true positive cases</a> (<em>SN: 8/31/20</em>), but can reveal an infection in just 15 minutes.&nbsp;</p>



<h4>Test-to-play, test-to-stay</h4>



<p>High school football players were the guinea pigs for Utah’s rapid testing strategy.</p>



<p>Almost all schools in the state tried to stay in person during the 2020–2021 school year. “In the first couple months of school, we saw a spike in case counts [among students],” says Kendra Babitz, the COVID-19 state testing director for the Utah Department of Health. That spike peaked in November, prompting all extracurricular activities to be canceled, except for the football playoffs.</p>



<p>“They were just about done, and we thought this would be a great place to test out testing,” Babitz says.</p>



<p>To compete, athletes had to present a negative test, usually an <a href="https://www.abbott.com/corpnewsroom/diagnostics-testing/BinaxNOW-what-you-need-to-know.html">Abbott BinaxNOW rapid antigen test</a> provided by the state, within 72 hours before a game or practice. Players with positive tests were barred from participation and instructed to isolate for 10 days, with the option of testing out of isolation after seven days. Their close contacts were told to quarantine too.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" width="1440" height="810" src="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/080521_jl_covid-school-testing_inline1_football.jpg" alt="Football players, coaches and fans at a game in Utah" class="wp-image-3102514" srcset="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/080521_jl_covid-school-testing_inline1_football.jpg 1440w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/080521_jl_covid-school-testing_inline1_football-680x383.jpg 680w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/080521_jl_covid-school-testing_inline1_football-800x450.jpg 800w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/080521_jl_covid-school-testing_inline1_football-330x186.jpg 330w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/080521_jl_covid-school-testing_inline1_football-768x432.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/080521_jl_covid-school-testing_inline1_football-1030x580.jpg 1030w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/080521_jl_covid-school-testing_inline1_football-1380x776.jpg 1380w" sizes="(max-width: 1440px) 100vw, 1440px" /><figcaption><span class="caption wp-caption-3102514">Utah’s public school system tested its rapid antigen testing strategy during the high school football playoff season. To play, athletes had to present a negative COVID-19 test taken within 72 hours of an event.</span><span class="credit wp-credit-3102514">Chris Gardner/Getty Images</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>Anecdotally, this test-to-play strategy incentivized adherence to other preventive measures, like wearing masks, Babitz says. The playoffs themselves went off with few hitches, and the percentage of positive tests among players dropped from about 4 percent to about 2 percent over two weeks. Over the next several weeks, test-to-play was extended to all extracurricular activities at 127 public high schools across the state.</p>



<p>Off the heels of the test-to-play strategy’s success, 13 high schools adopted a similar protocol for sustaining in-person learning. Instead of sending all students home for remote learning in the early stages of an outbreak, schools that used a “test-to-stay” program would screen all consenting students with rapid antigen tests whenever COVID-19 cases spiked above 1 or 2 percent of the student body. (Some schools went further, testing students every two weeks, regardless of cases.)</p>



<p>Those who tested negative could stay in school — effectively testing out of remote learning — while students who tested positive had to isolate at home for 10 days. Students who opted out of the test-to-stay program were recommended, but not required, to switch to remote learning for 10 days if testing participation rates were below 60 percent, or if more than 2.5 percent of participating students tested positive.</p>



<p>Allowing students to test out of remote learning after an outbreak <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/70/wr/mm7021e2.htm#:~:text=Test%20to%20Play%20was%20implemented,extracurricular%20winter%20athletics%20competition%20events.&amp;text=Test%20to%20Stay%20was%20conducted,%2Dperson%20instruction%20student%2Ddays.">saved more than 100,000 in-person student learning days</a>, Babitz and others reported May 28 in <em>Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report. </em>Reported COVID-19 cases in the schools also declined overall after test-to-stay was implemented, though this study did not assess the impact of this intervention on transmission in schools. But a study in England found that schools where students could rapidly test out of quarantine had <a href="https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.07.23.21260992v1">similar transmission rates</a> as schools that kept students out of school during the full quarantine period, researchers reported July 25 at medRxiv.org.</p>

<p>Overall, the test-to-play and test-to-stay programs were “a big success,” Babitz says. All told, nearly 60,000 students were tested through both programs, and nearly 1,900, or 3.2 percent, got a positive result.</p>



<p>Still, while declining cases meant that the whole suite of COVID-19 mitigation measures that schools were using were working, Babitz explains, that could sometimes lead to skepticism from the community. People ask, “Is this really worth the lift if we&#8217;re not getting that many people?” she says. Participation rates in the testing programs fell as the year progressed. This fall, Babitz worries that more parents will be resistant to enrolling their children in the Utah programs, hamstringing them from the start.</p>



<p>Other states, including Delaware, are planning to implement similar rapid testing strategies this coming school year.</p>



<p>Antigen tests work by rapidly detecting proteins from the coronavirus instead of having to sequence genetic material as PCR tests do, which takes more time. That quick turnaround offers significant advantages over PCR testing. But some experts worry that the rapid tests’ higher propensity for false positives among people without symptoms could isolate some students in unnecessary quarantines.</p>



<p>“If you’re using a rapid test for screening, it’s important to have a confirmatory test available and available quickly so that you can get confirmation of a positive result and know whether you really need to isolate that person and quarantine their contacts,” says Andrea Ciaranello, an infectious disease physician at Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston.</p>



<h4>Innovative ideas</h4>



<p>Last year, Colorado Mesa University in Grand Junction went beyond simply swabbing students’ noses, opting to also surveil the endpoint of potentially virus-laden excrement: wastewater.</p>



<p>Infected individuals shed virus into their stool. Once flushed, that stool flows through pipes, interweaving with the plumbing of other toilets, rooms, buildings and even neighborhoods, providing a slurry that can be sampled. Testing wastewater for coronavirus, via PCR, at different stages of the system offers a <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coronavirus-covid-19-wastewater-sewage-warning-monitoring">quick way to screen groups</a> of tens to thousands of people (<em>SN: 5/28/20</em>).</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" width="680" height="339" src="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/080521_jl_covid-school-testing_inline2_wastewater.jpg" alt="two people check a wastewater monitoring station on a field at the University of Colorado Boulder campus" class="wp-image-3102515" srcset="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/080521_jl_covid-school-testing_inline2_wastewater.jpg 680w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/080521_jl_covid-school-testing_inline2_wastewater-330x165.jpg 330w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><figcaption><span class="caption wp-caption-3102515">During the 2020–2021 school year, some U.S. universities tested wastewater from dormitories to surveil for COVID-19 outbreaks. Samples can be collected from wastewater monitoring stations, like this one on the University of Colorado Boulder’s campus.</span><span class="credit wp-credit-3102515">Glenn Asakawa/CU Boulder</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>Colorado Mesa University <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coronavirus-covid-19-college-university-campus-cases-testing">sampled individual dormitory’s wastewater</a> (<em>SN: 2/23/21</em>), which allowed the school to detect five COVID-19 outbreaks in their early stages last year. Such surveillance testing can provide information on transmission within a community and can guide decisions about whether other mitigation measures should be scaled up or down.</p>



<p>“Wastewater is ideal for a residential system, where everyone is pooping into the same sewage system,” Ciaranello says. That’s not always the case in a K-12 school setting, she says, since students are there for only a few hours each day.</p>



<p>But there is another place that the coronavirus can accumulate: air filters. David Coil, a microbiologist at the University of California, Davis, is developing a form of surveillance testing that piggybacks off of the increased use of air filters in some schools.</p>



<p>“By testing air filters for viral RNA, we can see whether a virus is circulating in a classroom,” he says. It’s like the testing of pooled samples in that it covers many students in a single sample but doesn’t require wrangling parental consent forms and actual swabs from kids, he says. That wrangling becomes necessary if a classroom tests positive, of course, but surveilling air filters instead of students could help schools get a course look at transmission without the rigmarole of testing lots of students.</p>



<p>More creative testing measures like these may be necessary this fall, as a delta-driven COVID-19 surge collides with kids going back to school. With $10 billion in testing funding for K-12 schools through the American Rescue Plan, there’s an opportunity to scale up promising approaches, says Bilinski, the infectious disease modeler at Brown University. “At this stage of the pandemic, we have both the technology and the funding to make exposures less costly and disruptive. We should use it.”</p>

<html><body><p>Note: the following announcement is courtesy of<a href="https://sparcopen.org/"> SPARC.</a></p>



<p>The 2021 Open Access Week Advisory Committee is pleased to announce that the theme for this year&rsquo;s International Open Access Week, to be held October 25-31, will be &ldquo;It Matters How We Open Knowledge: Building Structural Equity.&rdquo;</p>



<p>This year&rsquo;s theme intentionally aligns with the recently released&nbsp;<a href="https://en.unesco.org/science-sustainable-future/open-science/recommendation">UNESCO Recommendation on Open Science</a>, of which Open Access is a crucial component. Circulated in draft form following discussion by representatives of UNESCO&rsquo;s 193 member countries, the Recommendation powerfully articulates and centers the importance of equity in pursuing a future for scholarship that is open by default.</p>



<p><em>Open Science should embrace a diversity of knowledge, practices, workflows, languages, research outputs and research topics that support the needs and epistemic pluralism of the scientific community as a whole, diverse research communities and scholars, as well as the wider public and knowledge holders beyond the traditional scientific community, including Indigenous Peoples and local communities, and social actors from different countries and regions, as appropriate. (UNESCO Recommendation on Open Science, Page 7)</em></p>



<p>As the first global standard-setting framework on Open Science, the UNESCO Recommendation will provide an important guide for governments around the world as they move from aspiration to the implementation of open research practices. This year&rsquo;s theme of &ldquo;It Matters How We Open Knowledge: Building Structural Equity&rdquo; highlights the Recommendation&rsquo;s call for equitable participation for all producers and consumers of knowledge.</p>



<p><em>Open Science should play a significant role in ensuring equity among researchers from developed and developing countries, enabling fair and reciprocal sharing of scientific inputs and outputs and equal access to scientific knowledge to both producers and consumers of knowledge regardless of location, nationality, race, age, gender, income, socio-economic circumstances, career stage, discipline, language, religion, disability, ethnicity or migratory status or any other grounds. (UNESCO Recommendation on Open Science, Page 7)</em></p>



<p>International Open Access Week is a time for the wider community to coordinate in taking action to make openness the default for research and to ensure that equity is at the center of this work. This year&rsquo;s Open Access Week will be held from October 25th through the 31st; however, organizers are encouraged to host discussions and take action around this year&rsquo;s theme whenever is most suitable during the year and to adapt the theme and activities to their local context. This is especially true as countries around the world continue to face varying levels of disruption due to COVID-19 and increasing disruption due to climate change.</p>



<p>Diversity, equity, and inclusion must be consistently prioritized year-round and integrated into the fabric of the open community, from how our infrastructure is built to how we organize community discussions to the governance structures we use. International Open Access Week is an important opportunity to catalyze new conversations, create connections across and between communities that can facilitate this co-design, and advance progress to build more equitable foundations for opening knowledge&mdash;discussions and actions that need to be continued, year in and year out.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/black-holes-mass-measure-new-technique-accretion-disk">Measuring a black hole’s mass isn’t easy. A new technique could change that</a></h4>

              
                <p>An actively feeding black hole surrounds itself with a disk of hot gas and dust that flickers like a campfire. Astronomers have now found that monitoring changes in those flickers can reveal something that is notoriously hard to measure: the behemoth’s heft.</p>



<p>“It’s a new way to weigh black holes,” says astronomer Colin Burke of the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. What’s more, the method could be used on <a href="https://science.sciencemag.org/lookup/doi/10.1126/science.abg9933">any astrophysical object with an accretion disk</a>, and may even help find elusive midsize black holes, researchers report in the Aug. 13 <em>Science</em>.</p>



<p>It’s not easy to measure a black hole’s mass. For one thing, the dark behemoths are notoriously difficult to see. But sometimes black holes reveal themselves when they eat. As gas and dust falls into a black hole, the material organizes into a disk that is heated to white-hot temperatures and can, in some cases, outshine all the stars in the galaxy combined.</p>



<p>Measuring the black hole’s diameter can reveal its mass using Einstein’s general theory of relativity. But only the globe-spanning Event Horizon Telescope has made this sort of measurement, and <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/m87-black-hole-image-best-mass-estimates-star-motion">for only one black hole</a> so far (<em>SN: 4/22/19</em>). Other black holes have been weighed via observations of their influence on the material around them, but that takes a lot of data and doesn’t work for every supermassive black hole.</p>





<p>So, looking for another way, Burke and colleagues turned to accretion disks. Astronomers aren’t sure how black holes’ disks flicker, but it seems like small changes in light combine to brighten or dim the entire disk over a given span of time. Previous research had hinted that the time it takes a disk to fade, brighten and fade again is related to the mass of its central black hole. But those claims were controversial, and didn’t cover the full range of black hole masses, Burke says.</p>



<p>So he and colleagues assembled observations of 67 actively feeding black holes with known masses. The behemoths spanned sizes from 10,000 to 10 billion solar masses. For the smallest of these black holes, the flickers changed on timescales of hours to weeks. Supermassive black holes with masses between 100 million and 10 billion solar masses flickered more slowly, every few hundred days.</p>



<p>“That gives us a hint that, okay, if this relation holds for small supermassive black holes and big ones, maybe it’s sort of a universal feature,” Burke says.</p>



<p>Out of curiosity, the team also looked at white dwarfs, the compact corpses of stars like the sun, which are some of the smallest objects to sport consistent accretion disks. Those white dwarfs followed the same relationship between flicker speed and mass.</p>



<p>The analyzed black holes didn’t cover the entire possible range of masses. Known black holes that are from about 100 to 100,000 times the mass of the sun are rare. There are several potential candidates, but <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/physics-gravitational-waves-midsize-black-hole-collision-ligo-virgo">only one has been confirmed</a> (<em>SN: 9/2/20</em>). In the future, the relationship between disk flickers and black hole mass could tell astronomers exactly what kind of disk flickers to look for to help bring these midsize beasts out of hiding, if they’re there to be found, Burke says.</p>



<p>Astrophysicist Vivienne Baldassare of Washington State University in Pullman studies black holes in dwarf galaxies, which may preserve some of the properties of ancient black holes that formed in the early universe. One of the biggest challenges in her work is measuring black hole masses. The study’s “super exciting results … will have a large impact for my research, and I expect many others as well,” she says.</p>



<p>The method offers a simpler way to weigh black holes than any previous technique, Burke says — but not necessarily a faster one. More massive black holes, for example, would need hundreds of days, or possibly years, of observations to reveal their masses.</p>



<p>Upcoming observatories are already planning to take that kind of data. The <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/new-observatory-named-after-dark-matter-pioneer-vera-rubin">Vera C. Rubin Observatory</a> is expected to start observing the entire sky every night beginning in 2022 or 2023 (<em>SN: 1/10/20</em>). Once the telescope has been running long enough, the observations needed to weigh black holes “will fall out for free” from the Rubin Observatory data, Burke says. “We’re already building it. We may as well do this.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/statistical-significance-p-value-null-hypothesis-origins">How the strange idea of ‘statistical significance’ was born</a></h4>

              
                <p>In the middle of the 20<sup>th</sup> century, the field of psychology had a problem. In the wake of the Manhattan Project and in the early days of the space race, the so-called “hard sciences” were producing tangible, highly publicized results. Psychologists and other social scientists looked on enviously. Their results were squishy, and difficult to quantify.</p>



<p>Psychologists in particular wanted a statistical skeleton key to unlock true experimental insights. It was an unrealistic burden to place on statistics, but the longing for a mathematical seal of approval burned hot. So psychology textbook writers and publishers created one, and called it <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/odds-are-its-wrong">statistical significance</a>.</p>



<p>By calculating just one number from their experimental results, called a P value, researchers could now deem those results “statistically significant.” That was all it took to claim — even if mistakenly — that an interesting and powerful effect had been demonstrated. The idea took off, and soon legions of researchers were reporting statistically significant results.</p>



<p>To make matters worse, psychology journals began to publish papers only if they reported statistically significant findings, prompting a surprisingly large number of investigators to massage their data — <a href="https://www.cmu.edu/dietrich/sds/docs/loewenstein/MeasPrevalQuestTruthTelling.pdf">either by gaming the system or cheating</a> — to get below the P value of 0.05 that granted that status. Inevitably, bogus findings and chance associations began to proliferate.</p>





<p>As editor of a journal called <em>Memory &amp; Cognition</em> from 1993 to 1997, Geoffrey Loftus of the University of Washington tried valiantly to yank psychologists out of their statistical rut. At the start of his tenure, Loftus published an editorial telling researchers to <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/closed-thinking">stop mindlessly calculating whether experimental results are statistically significant or not</a> (<em>SN: 5/16/13</em>). That common practice impeded scientific progress, he warned.</p>



<p>Keep it simple, Loftus advised. Remember that a picture is worth a thousand reckonings of statistical significance. In that spirit, he recommended reporting straightforward averages to compare groups of volunteers in a psychology experiment. Graphs could show whether individuals’ scores covered a broad range or clumped around the average, enabling a calculation of whether the average score would likelychange a little or a lot in a repeat study. In this way, researchers could evaluate, say, whether volunteers scored better on a difficult math test if first allowed to write about their thoughts and feelings for 10 minutes, versus sitting quietly for 10 minutes.</p>



<p>Loftus might as well have tried to lasso a runaway train. Most researchers kept right on touting the statistical significance of their results.</p>



<p>“Significance testing is all about how the world isn’t and says nothing about how the world is,” Loftus later said when looking back on his attempt to change how psychologists do research.</p>



<p>What’s remarkable is not only that mid-20<sup>th</sup> century psychology textbook writers and publishers <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/null-science">fabricated significance testing out of a mishmash of conflicting statistical techniques</a> (<em>SN: 6/7/97</em>). It’s also that their weird creation was embraced by many other disciplines over the next few decades. It didn’t matter that eminent statisticians and psychologists panned significance testing from the start. The concocted calculation proved highly popular in social sciences, biomedical and epidemiological research, neuroscience and biological anthropology.</p>



<p>A human hunger for certainty fueled that academic movement. Lacking unifying theories to frame testable predictions, scientists studying the mind and other human-related topics rallied around a statistical routine. Repeating the procedure provided a false but comforting sense of having tapped into the truth. Known formally as null hypothesis significance testing, the practice assumes a null hypothesis (no difference, or no correlation, between experimental groups on measures of interest) and then rejects that hypothesis if the P value for observed data came out to less than 5 percent (P &lt; .05).</p>



<div class="wp-block-sciencenews-content-sidebar alignright">
<h3>P value</h3>



<p>A P value is the probability of an observed (or more extreme) result arising only from chance.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="680" height="400" src="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/100-psych_spotlight-null_inline_p-value_mobile.png" alt="illustration of a bell curve with the p value segment shaded in blue" class="wp-image-3102483" srcset="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/100-psych_spotlight-null_inline_p-value_mobile.png 680w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/100-psych_spotlight-null_inline_p-value_mobile-651x383.png 651w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/100-psych_spotlight-null_inline_p-value_mobile-316x186.png 316w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><figcaption><span class="credit wp-credit-3102483">E.

</div>



<p>The problem is that slavishly performing this procedure absolves researchers of having to develop theories that make specific, falsifiable predictions — the fundamental elements of good science. Rejecting a null hypothesis doesn’t tell an investigator anything new. It only creates an opportunity to speculate about why an effect might have occurred. Statistically significant results are rarely used as a launching pad for testing alternative explanations of those findings.</p>



<p>Psychologist Gerd Gigerenzer, director of the Harding Risk Literacy Center in Berlin, considers it more accurate to call null hypothesis significance testing “the null ritual.”</p>



<p>Here’s an example of the null ritual in action. A <a href="https://science.sciencemag.org/content/336/6080/493">2012 study published in <em>Science</em></a> concluded that volunteers’ level of religious belief declined after viewing pictures of Auguste Rodin’s statue <em>The Thinker</em>, in line with an idea that mental reflection causes people to question their faith in supernatural entities. In this study, the null hypothesis predicted that volunteers’ religious beliefs would stay the same, on average, after seeing <em>The Thinker</em>, assuming that the famous sculpture has no effect on viewers’ spiritual convictions.</p>



<p>The null ritual dictated that the researchers calculate whether group differences in religious beliefs before and after perusing the statue would have occurred by chance in no more than one out of 20 trials, or no more than 5 percent of the time. That’s what P &lt; .05 means. By meeting that threshold, the result was tagged statistically significant, and not likely due to mere chance.</p>



<p>If that sounds reasonable, hold on. Even after meeting an arbitrary 5 percent threshold for statistical significance, the study hadn’t demonstrated that statue viewers were losing their religion. Researchers could only conjecture about why that might be the case, because the null ritual forced them to assume that there is no effect. Talk about running in circles.</p>



<p>To top it off, an independent redo of <em>The Thinker</em> study found no statistically significant decline in religious beliefs among viewers of the pensive statue. Frequent failures to confirm statistically significant results have triggered <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/blog/science-the-public/replication-crisis-psychology-science-studies-statistics">a crisis of confidence in sciences wedded to the null ritual</a> (<em>SN: 8/27/18</em>).</p>



<p>Some journals now require investigators to fork over their research designs and experimental data before submitting research papers for peer review. The goal is to discourage data fudging and to up the odds of publishing results that can be confirmed by other researchers.</p>

</div>



<p>But the real problem lies in the null ritual itself, Gigerenzer says. In the early 20<sup>th</sup> century, and without ever calculating the statistical significance of anything, Wolfgang Köhler developed Gestalt laws of perception, Jean Piaget formulated a theory of how thinking develops in children and Ivan Pavlov discovered principles of classical conditioning. Those pioneering scientists typically studied one or a handful of individuals using the types of simple statistics endorsed decades later by Loftus.</p>



<p>From 1940 to 1955, psychologists concerned with demonstrating the practical value of their field, especially to educators, sought an objective tool for telling real from chance findings. Rather than acknowledging that conflicting statistical approaches existed, psychology textbook writers and publishers mashed those methods into the one-size-fits-all P value, Gigerenzer says.</p>



<p>One inspiration for the null ritual came from British statistician Ronald Fisher. Starting in the 1930s, Fisher devised a type of significance testing to analyze the likelihood of a null hypothesis, which a researcher could propose as either an effect or no effect. Fisher wanted to calculate the exact statistical significance associated with, say, using a particular fertilizer deemed promising for crop yields.</p>



<p>Around the same time, statisticians Jerzy Neyman and Egon Pearson argued that testing a single null hypothesis is useless. Instead, they insisted on determining which of at least two alternative hypotheses best explained experimental results. Neyman and Pearson calculated an experiment’s probability of accepting a hypothesis that’s actually true, something left unexamined in Fisher’s null hypothesis test.</p>



<p>Psychologists’ null ritual folded elements of both approaches into a confusing hodge-podge. Researchers often don’t realize that statistically significant results don’t prove that a true effect has been discovered.</p>



<p>And about half of surveyed medical, biological and psychological researchers <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-019-00857-9">wrongly assume that finding no statistical significance in a study means that there was no actual effect</a>. A closer analysis may reveal findings consistent with a real effect, especially when the original results fell just short of the arbitrary cutoff for statistical significance.</p>

</div>



<p>It’s well past time to dump the null ritual, says psychologist and applied statistician Richard Morey of Cardiff University, Wales. <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/2515245918776023">Researchers need to focus on developing theories of mind and behavior that lead to testable predictions.</a> In that brave new scientific world, investigators will choose which of many statistical tools best suits their needs. “Statistics offer ways to figure out how to doubt what you’re seeing,” Morey says.</p>



<p>There’s no doubt that the illusion of finding truth in statistical significance still appeals to researchers in many fields. Morey hopes that, perhaps within a few decades, the null ritual’s reign of errors will end.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/indigenous-people-philippines-denisovan-dna-genetics">An Indigenous people in the Philippines have the most Denisovan DNA</a></h4>

              
                <p>Denisovans are an elusive bunch, known mainly from ancient DNA samples and traces of that DNA that the ancient hominids shared when they interbred with <em>Homo sapiens</em>. They left their biggest genetic imprint on people who now live in Southeast Asian islands, nearby Papua New Guinea and Australia. Genetic evidence now shows that a Philippine Negrito ethnic group has inherited the most Denisovan ancestry of all. Indigenous people known as the Ayta Magbukon get around 5 percent of their DNA from Denisovans, a new study finds.</p>



<p>This finding fits an evolutionary scenario in which two or more Stone Age Denisovan populations independently reached various Southeast Asian islands, including the Philippines and a landmass that consisted of what’s now Papua New Guinea, Australia and Tasmania. Exact arrival dates are unknown, but <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/ancient-stone-tools-raise-tantalizing-questions-over-who-colonized-sulawesi">nearly 200,000-year-old stone tools found on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi</a> may have been made by Denisovans (<em>SN</em>: 1/13/16). <em>H. sapiens</em> groups that started arriving around 50,000 years ago or more then interbred with resident Denisovans.</p>



<p>Evolutionary geneticists Maximilian Larena and Mattias Jakobsson, both at Uppsala University in Sweden, and their team describe the new evidence August 12 in <em>Current Biology</em>.</p>



<p>Even as the complexities of ancient interbreeding in Southeast Asia become clearer, Denisovans remain a mysterious crowd. “It’s unclear how the different Denisovan groups on the mainland and on Southeast Asian islands were related [to each other] and how genetically diverse they were,” Jakobsson says.</p>





<p>Papua New Guinea highlanders — estimated to carry close to 4 percent Denisovan DNA in the new study — were previously thought to be the modern record holders for Denisovan ancestry. But the Ayta Magbukon display roughly 30 percent to 40 percent more Denisovan ancestry than Papua New Guinea highlanders and Indigenous Australians, Jakobsson says. That calculation accounts for recent mating of East Asians with Philippine Negrito groups, including the Ayta Magbukon, that diluted Denisovan inheritance to varying degrees.</p>



<p>Genetic analyses suggest that Ayta Magbukon people retain slightly more Denisovan ancestry than other Philippine Negrito groups due to having mated less often with East Asian migrants to the island around 2,281 years ago, the scientists say. Their genetic analyses compared ancient DNA from Denisovans and Neandertals with that of 1,107 individuals from 118 ethnic groups in the Philippines, including 25 Negrito populations. Comparisons were then made to previously collected DNA from present-day Papua New Guinea highlanders and Indigenous Australians.</p>



<p>The new report underscores that “still today there are populations that have not been fully genetically described and that Denisovans were geographically widespread,” says paleogeneticist Cosimo Posth of the University of Tübingen in Germany, who was not part of the new research.</p>



<p>But it’s too early to say whether Stone Age <em>Homo</em> fossils found on Southeast Asian islands come from Denisovans, populations that interbred with Denisovans or other <em>Homo</em> lineages, Posth says. Only DNA extracted from those fossils can resolve that issue, he adds. Unfortunately, ancient DNA preserves poorly in fossils from tropical climates.</p>



<p>Only a handful of confirmed Denisovan fossils exist. Those consist of <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/new-dates-narrow-down-when-denisovans-and-neandertals-crossed-paths">a few fragmentary specimens from a Siberian cave</a> where Denisovans lived from around 300,000 to 50,000 years ago (<em>SN: 1/30/19</em>), and a roughly 160,000-year-old <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/jawbone-shows-denisovans-lived-tibetan-plateau-long-humans">partial jaw found on the Tibetan Plateau</a> (<em>SN: 5/1/19</em>).&nbsp;</p>



<p>Fossils from the Philippines <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/new-hominid-species-homo-luzonensis-philippines">initially classed as <em>H. luzonensis</em></a>, dating to 50,000 years ago or more (<em>SN: 4/10/19</em>), might actually represent Denisovans. But a lack of consensus on what Denisovans looked like leaves the evolutionary identity of those fossils uncertain.</p>



<p>Larena and Jakobsson’s findings “further increase my suspicions that Denisovan fossils are hiding in plain sight” among previously excavated discoveries on Southeast Asian islands, says population geneticist João Teixeira of the University of Adelaide in Australia, who did not participate in the new study.</p>



<p>Denisovans may have genetically encompassed <em>H. luzonensis</em> and two other fossil hominids found on different Southeast Asian islands, <em>H. floresiensis</em> on Flores and <em>H. erectus</em> on Java, Teixeira suspects. <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/hobbit-history-gets-new-preface"><em>H. floresiensis</em>, or hobbits</a>, survived from at least 100,000 years ago to around 60,000 years ago (<em>SN: 6/8/16</em>). <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/homo-erectus-last-known-appearance-roughly-117000-years-ago"><em>H. erectus </em>arrived on Java</a> about 1.6 million years ago and died out between 117,000 and 108,000 years ago (<em>SN: 12/18/19</em>).</p>



<p>Geographic ancestry patterns on Southeastern Asian islands and in Australia suggest that this region was <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41559-021-01408-0">settled by a genetically distinct Denisovan population</a> from southern parts of mainland East Asia, Teixeira and his colleagues reported in the May <em>Nature Ecology &amp; Evolution</em>.</p>

                <p><em>By </em><a href="http://emilyoliviareynolds.com/">Emily Reynolds</a></p>



<p>The impact of technology on young people is an oft-debated topic in the media. Is <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2018/10/02/researchers-find-the-most-plausible-cause-of-wellbeing-decline-in-youth-is-increased-screen-time/">increased screen time</a> having a serious impact on their mental health? Or have we <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2019/05/31/link-between-teens-time-on-digital-devices-and-lower-wellbeing-is-too-small-to-merit-substantial-scientific-discussion/">over-exaggerated</a> the level of risk young people face due to their use of tech?</p>



<p>According to a <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41599-021-00863-1">new study</a>, published in <em>Humanities and Social Sciences Communications, </em>we could be asking the wrong questions. A team led by Nastasia Griffioen at Radboud University Nijmegen suggests that rather than looking at screen time in a binary way, researchers should explore the nuances of smartphone use: <em>how</em> young people are using their phones, rather than the fact they’re using them at all.</p>



<span id="more-43220"></span>



<p>The original aim of the study was to look at how stress regulation affected social media use. First, 114 participants aged 18 to 25 filled in measures of depression, anxiety, emotional regulation, self-compassion and rejection sensitivity. They were then split into two conditions: a stress condition, in which they had to give a recorded presentation for five minutes, and a control condition, in which they simply viewed and rated two presentations.</p>



<p>Participants were then asked to wait in the experiment room for ten minutes and told not to move from their seat; meanwhile, and unknown to the participants, a camera recorded their activity, looking closely at phone use. Upon the researcher’s return, participants were shown the video and were asked to share their motivations, thoughts and feelings each time they had started a new activity on their phones.</p>



<p>Due to methodological issues, the stress manipulation didn’t seem to work. But the team still found some interesting results regarding smartphone use overall. Phone use was widespread: 96.5% of participants used their phone at some point during the ten minutes, 80% of whom started using their phone as soon as the experimenter left the room. Just over 48% used their smartphone for the full ten minutes. <em>How</em> participants used their phones, however, was more varied. Some used mainly social media, while others engaged in online shopping, read articles, or played games; similarly, some participants switched between apps only once, while others switched up to twenty one times.</p>



<p>Only a quarter of participants said they felt bad during an activity they’d engaged in on their phones, and these negative feelings were not normally related to social interactions: for instance, some participants reported feeling generally bored, while one reported feeling bad after finding out that their football club had lost. While some reported feeling bad because of what someone else had posted or sent them, these experiences were in the minority. Nearly 94% of participants also reported having positive feelings while using their phone — laughing at a funny post, feeling curious about something, or simply enjoying looking through their feeds. Messaging apps were associated with the highest level of positive feeling.</p>



<p>The team also looked at active vs. passive use of phones. While some participants made a conscious choice not to use their smartphone at all, passive phone use was most closely associated with social media, which participants largely engaged with out of habit or boredom. However, there wasn’t much evidence that participants’ feelings were different during passive vs active use.</p>



<p>With such disparate phone activities established, the team then turned to the mental health symptoms measured at the start of the study. Adults with high levels of depression symptoms reported fewer positive feelings associated with using social media, and in particular with passive use of social media — but at the same time were also more likely to use Facebook. This was also the case for those with higher levels of anxiety. Participants with higher levels of sensitivity to rejection were less likely to spend time messaging, and less likely to experience positive feelings while messaging, using social media, and scrolling. On the other hand, those with higher levels of self-compassion were more likely to experience positive feelings, more likely to use a varied number of social media platforms, and showed higher engagement in non-smartphone based activities.</p>



<p>So while phone use was fairly ubiquitous, it’s clear that participants differed in terms of the activities they chose to do, how they felt about doing them, and the individual differences that impacted both. The team argues that the fact young people use their phones in many different ways and for many different reasons essentially renders catch-all questions about “screen time” useless. Because the study was time-limited and conducted in a lab, future research could also look at how smartphones are used in daily life.</p>



<p>As the team says, the results suggest a “complex, dynamic, and variable picture” when it comes to phone use and its impact. Looking more carefully at these individual differences, rather than simply condemning phone use completely, could provide more useful insights and more useful interventions for those kinds of use that do cause harm.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/birds-steal-animal-hair-fur-nest-new-word-video">Scientists have a new word for birds stealing animal hair</a></h4>

              
                <p>Some tiny birds take bold risks to gather a beakful of hair for their nests. Titmice have been spotted dive-bombing cats, alighting on dozing predators’ backs and plucking strands of hair from people’s heads. Now, there’s a term for the unusual behavior: kleptotrichy.</p>



<p>Derived from the Greek words for “to steal” and “hair,” kleptotrichy has rarely been described by scientists, but <a href="https://esajournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ecy.3501?af=R">dozens of YouTube videos capture the behavior</a>, researchers report online July 27 in <em>Ecology. </em>Titmice — and one chickadee — have been caught on video tugging hair from dogs, cats, humans, raccoons and even a porcupine.<strong></strong></p>



<p>“Citizen scientists, bird watchers and people with dogs knew this behavior much more than the scientists themselves,” says animal behaviorist Mark Hauber of the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. “Popular observations precede science rather than the other way around, which is a valid way to do science.”<strong></strong></p>

</div><figcaption>Scientists counting birds in an Illinois state park in May 2020 spotted a tufted titmouse plucking fur off a dozing, unbothered raccoon. The team dubbed the behavior “kleptotrichy” after a search of the scientific literature and amateur videos on YouTube turned up more than 100 instances of hair thievery by birds.</figcaption></figure>



<p>Witnessing a bird steal hair from a mammal in the wild is what first inspired Hauber’s colleague, ecologist Henry Pollock, to dig deeper. While counting birds in an Illinois state park in May 2020, Pollock and colleagues spotted a tufted titmouse pluck fur from a sleeping raccoon. “I was like, ‘Wow, I’ve never seen anything like that,” says Pollock, also of the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.</p>





<p>In South America, palm swifts snatch feathers from flying pigeons and parrots — a behavior already known as kleptoptily. Searching through the scientific literature, Hauber, Pollock and colleagues found only 11 anecdotes of birds stealing hair from live mammals. While most published accounts involve titmice in North America, at least five other bird species get in on the action. Researchers have seen an American crow harvest hair from a cow and a red-winged starling in Africa peck a small antelope called a klipspringer. In Australia, three honeyeater bird species steal fur from koalas.</p>





<p>Meanwhile, a YouTube search by the team turned up 99 videos of tufted titmice, a mountain chickadee and a black-crested titmouse plucking hair from mammals. The latter two bird species had not previously been identified as hair thieves in the scientific literature.</p>



<p>Scientists generally assume that birds gather hair for their nests in low-risk ways, relying on carcasses or stray fluff shed into the wind. “Plucking hairs from raccoons, which are common avian nest predators, suggests that it&#8217;s obviously worth it to get that hair,” Pollock says.</p>



<p>Hair-harvesting species tend to live in colder climates, so those birds probably prize hair’s insulating properties, the team says. Some birds might also spruce up their nests with mammal hair to <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/stinking-decorations-protect-nests">confuse would-be predators</a> and parasites (<em>SN:</em> <em>8/28/01</em>).</p>

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/~r/plos/Blog/~3/5J69ZGH_lVw/">A peek into the PLOS ONE review process</a></h4>

              
                <!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/loose.dtd">
<html><body><p><strong>Author</strong><br>Emily Chenette, Editor-in-Chief, PLOS ONE<br><br>When <em>PLOS ONE</em> launched nearly 15 years ago, it was the very first multidisciplinary journal that aimed to publish all ethically and methodologically rigorous research, regardless of the novelty of the findings or the perceived impact of the work. We were then &ndash; as we are now &ndash; immensely gratified by the strong community support for the journal and for accessible Open Access publishing, and were <a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2011/01/welcome-nature-seriously-2/">delighted</a> when other publishers took notice and launched Open Access &ldquo;megajournals&rdquo; of their own.&nbsp;</p>



<p>When I meet <em>PLOS ONE</em> authors I&rsquo;ll often ask why they chose to submit to us and what they think sets the journal apart from its cousins. Often authors will mention the speed of the review process, or our publication criteria, or the calibre of our editorial board members. Some authors say that PLOS&rsquo; mission and strong support for Open Science was a major draw. Occasionally, they&rsquo;ll say that they&rsquo;ve been encouraged to submit by a member of our editorial board or another past author.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But what about the quality of the review process? After all, administering high-quality peer review is a fundamental role for any scientific journal. The process at <em>PLOS ONE</em> is quite special, especially given the volume of submissions we receive. I&rsquo;m really happy to have this opportunity to share a bit more about our <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/s/editorial-and-peer-review-process">review process</a> and why I think it makes <em>PLOS ONE</em> unique.</p>



<h3>Detailed initial editorial checks</h3>



<p>All new manuscript submissions &ndash; and we receive &gt;100 of them every day &ndash; are subjected to an initial technical check to ensure that the submission is complete. Once manuscripts pass this stage, they are individually assigned to and assessed by our team of subject matter experts, who have expertise in the study topic. The assessment at this stage focuses on <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/s/criteria-for-publication#loc-1">scope</a>, whether the <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/s/criteria-for-publication#loc-3">methods are presented in sufficient detail</a> for review purposes, the overall <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/s/criteria-for-publication#loc-5">quality of the language</a> and whether the research was conducted with <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/s/criteria-for-publication#loc-6">appropriate ethical approval and meets high ethical standards</a>. Manuscripts that do not comply with our standards are desk rejected with a detailed letter explaining why the submission does not meet our publication criteria (we reject around 20% of submissions without review).&nbsp;</p>



<h3>Robust editorial and peer review</h3>



<p>Manuscripts that pass these initial screening steps are then sent on to members of our <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/static/editorial-board">Editorial Board</a>, who administer the peer-review process. Academic Editors assess the manuscript against our <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/s/criteria-for-publication">seven publication criteria</a>, paying particular attention to whether the conclusions are supported by the data provided, and we work closely with our board to ensure that this process is as efficient as possible. For example, when an Academic Editor agrees to handle a new manuscript submission, we share any concerns that have arisen during our initial screening steps (such as missing details of animal care) and provide information on community standards that might be helpful in the review process (such as STRENDA guidelines for enzymology studies and PRISMA for systematic reviews). Additionally, if a manuscript has been posted as a preprint, we share the preprint link with the Academic Editor so that they can consider any comments that have been made. We also partner with initiatives like <a href="https://www.reviewcommons.org/">Review Commons</a> and <a href="https://peercommunityin.org/">Peer Community In</a> to weave pre-submission commenting into the review process and further streamline decision making.&nbsp;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-gallery columns-1 is-cropped"><ul class="blocks-gallery-grid"><li class="blocks-gallery-item"><figure><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="342" src="https://theplosblog.plos.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2021/08/ONE-peer-review-process-2-1024x342.png" alt="" data-id="19265" data-full-url="https://theplosblog.plos.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2021/08/ONE-peer-review-process-2.png" data-link="https://theplosblog.plos.org/?attachment_id=19265" class="wp-image-19265" srcset="https://theplosblog.plos.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2021/08/ONE-peer-review-process-2-1024x342.png 1024w, https://theplosblog.plos.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2021/08/ONE-peer-review-process-2-300x100.png 300w, https://theplosblog.plos.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2021/08/ONE-peer-review-process-2-768x256.png 768w, https://theplosblog.plos.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2021/08/ONE-peer-review-process-2-1536x513.png 1536w, https://theplosblog.plos.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2021/08/ONE-peer-review-process-2-2048x684.png 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></figure></li></ul><figcaption class="blocks-gallery-caption">The PLOS ONE peer review process.</figcaption></figure>



<p>Once the full complement of required feedback has been received, the Academic Editor issues a decision. We ask Academic Editors to justify their decisions in detail, which is especially important when there is discordance between the reviewers&rsquo; comments. Rejection decisions are sent straight to the authors at this point. However, if the Academic Editor submits a revision decision, additional journal requirements are added to the decision letter before it is transmitted to the authors. This can include reminding authors to <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/s/materials-software-and-code-sharing">deposit their software or code</a>, provide their original <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/s/figures#loc-blot-and-gel-reporting-requirements">gel or blot data</a>, amend their <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/s/competing-interests">competing interests</a> or <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/s/disclosure-of-funding-sources">financial declaration</a> disclosures, or to indicate <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/s/data-availability">where their data are available or can be obtained</a>. The complete decision letter is then sent to the authors, after which the Academic Editor and reviewer(s) also receive a copy.&nbsp;</p>



<h3>Aligning with our publication criteria and policies</h3>



<p>On resubmission, the revised manuscript undergoes another technical check to ensure that the rebuttal letter is present and that concerns around ethics, language or reporting that were identified by our subject matter experts have been addressed. The revised manuscript is then sent back to the original Academic Editor, who determines whether it can be accepted for publication or requires further review. When the Academic Editor is satisfied that the manuscript meets <em>PLOS ONE</em>&rsquo;s publication criteria, it is provisionally accepted for publication.&nbsp;</p>



<p>At this stage, we perform one final series of checks, including ensuring that there are no copyright concerns, all relevant data have been made available, and that no apparent conflicts of interest arose during review. We also ask authors whether they would like to publish the <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/s/editorial-and-peer-review-process#loc-peer-review-history">peer review history</a> of their submission. Once these checks are complete, the manuscript is formally accepted for publication, typeset, and published.&nbsp;</p>



<h3>Partnering with our Editorial Board for efficient, rigorous review&nbsp;</h3>



<p>What makes this process at <em>PLOS ONE</em> unique? In my experience, the partnership between our subject matter experts and Academic Editors, and the way we work together to focus on rigor rather than glamor, is rare. It&rsquo;s all the more incredible given that we collaborate to assess tens of thousands of submissions every year. This relationship aims to make peer review as smooth and rapid for authors as possible, while still ensuring that only robust, reproducible science is published. Partnering with our board in such a way also ensures that the publication process is efficient, that authors understand the basis for editorial decisions, and that all publishable research is open and accessible to all. We are grateful to our Academic Editors and to the reviewers they recruit for making this process work so well.</p>



<p>We will continue to seek ways to refine and streamline the review process at <em>PLOS ONE</em> in a way that best serves the needs of our communities. Please do <a href="mailto:plosone@plos.org">get in touch</a> if you have feedback on the review process or ideas for how we can further improve it.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/covid-colds-common-respiratory-diseases-kids-return-school">Colds and other common respiratory diseases might surge as kids return to school</a></h4>

              
                <p class="has-drop-cap" style="font-size:20px">As U.S. schools resume in-person learning this fall, parents and administrators may have to deal with more outbreaks of colds and other seasonal respiratory illnesses than usual. If so, these outbreaks aren’t likely to be especially dangerous for school-age children, but could be problematic for traditionally more vulnerable younger siblings or elderly relatives, experts say. And because the symptoms of these illnesses often mirror those of COVID-19, it could make having kids back in the classroom — and keeping them there — that much more challenging.</p>



<p>Respiratory viruses, which cause common colds and the flu, typically circulate in colder months. But last year’s cold-and-flu season was practically nonexistent. Some cold-causing viruses, such as rhinoviruses and enteroviruses, kept spreading, though at reduced levels. Influenza and respiratory syncytial virus, or RSV, however, were held to <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/covid-19-coronavirus-precautions-flu-respiratory-infections-cases">historically low levels</a>, an unintended effect of COVID-19 pandemic precautions such as border closings, wearing masks and social distancing (<em>SN: 2/2/21</em>). Other respiratory pathogens that cause cold-like symptoms, such as adenoviruses and parainfluenza viruses,&nbsp;<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34292924/">also had very mild seasons last winter</a>, researchers with the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention report July 23 in<em> Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report</em>.</p>



<p>“There&#8217;s been a huge, huge change during the COVID pandemic in the circulation of what we think of as the commonplace respiratory viruses and the seasonal respiratory viruses,” says Ellen Foxman, an immunologist at Yale School of Medicine. RSV and flu “have virtually disappeared during the COVID pandemic, almost certainly because of the mitigation measures.”</p>



<div class="wp-block-sciencenews-content-sidebar alignleft">
<h3>COVID-19: Back to school</h3>





<p>This story is one in a series looking at what to expect as U.S. children return to in-person school.</p>



<ul><li><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coronavirus-covid-kids-schools-reopening-cases">Schools are reopening. COVID-19 is still here. What does that mean for kids?</a></li><li><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/covid-school-kids-lost-education-learning-gap">What kids lost when COVID-19 upended school</a></li><li><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coronavirus-covid-kids-school-return-parents-questions">6 answers to parents’ COVID-19 questions as kids return to school</a></li><li><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coronavirus-covid-school-testing-kids-safe">How different COVID-19 testing plans can help keep kids safe in school</a></li></ul>
</div>



<p>But, worryingly, that absence has created a larger-than-usual population of people vulnerable to these common respiratory viruses. When people don’t get sick with the viruses for a year or two, immunity to them wanes. That makes those people, including school-age kids, more likely to get sick in the coming months.</p>



<p>Keeping COVID-19 precautions such as wearing masks in place could help keep these other respiratory viruses from surging. Without those precautions this coming winter, experts think high rates of RSV and other common respiratory viruses are probable.</p>



<p>A string of endless colds would be annoying and possibly disruptive to schooling, given that these viruses often cause symptoms like runny noses and cough, similar to some COVID-19 symptoms. That means kids might have to miss school while waiting for COVID-19 test results. What’s more, these kids can pass these infections on to very young or elderly family members.</p>



<p>“The kids are going to go to school, they&#8217;ll bring it home to the family and the younger children,” says Ian Barr, a virologist at the World Health Organization’s Collaborating Centre for Reference and Research on Influenza at the Doherty Institute in Melbourne, Australia. Those family members “are the ones who will … end up with the symptomatic and in some cases, serious infections.”</p>



<p>Influenza and RSV are the most serious seasonal respiratory viruses, especially for the very young and the elderly. The CDC estimates that <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/rsv/research/us-surveillance.html">RSV typically puts about 58,000 children under age 5 in the hospital each year</a> and is the most common cause of pneumonia in children under a year old. It also hospitalizes more than 177,000 adults 65 and older. Influenza viruses typically kill around 36,000 people a year in the United States and hospitalize almost half a million, the CDC estimates.</p>

<p>With the pandemic-induced lull in these diseases, there is now a larger population of people vulnerable to RSV and that has led to unusual, <a href="https://www.eurosurveillance.org/content/10.2807/1560-7917.ES.2021.26.29.2100186#html_fulltext">off-season outbreaks</a> of the illness in some places, researchers report July 22 in <em>Eurosurveillance</em>. Multiple states in Australia saw off-season RSV peaks in summer months that were even larger than traditional winter peaks. In Western Australia, the normal cold-weather peak for RSV is a little over 40 detections per week in the middle of July. But in 2020, there was no cold-weather peak. RSV infections stayed low until the warm months, and then <a href="https://academic.oup.com/cid/advance-article/doi/10.1093/cid/ciaa1906/6140790">peaked at over 100 detections a week in December</a>, researchers reported in February in <em>Clinical Infectious Diseases</em>.</p>



<p>In the United States, <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/surveillance/nrevss/rsv/natl-trend.html">detections of RSV have been mostly rising since spring</a>, according to the CDC’s National Respiratory and Enteric Virus Surveillance System. In late March, there were about 100 detections a week in the surveillance system. In the week ending July 24, there were more than 3,100 weekly detections. That’s still far below a normal RSV season; for example, cases peaked at 24,280 detections a week in December of 2019. But the timing is the thing, experts say. “It&#8217;s rare for most of these respiratory diseases to be circulating in summer,” says Barr, a coauthor of the <em>Eurosurveillance</em> study.</p>

<h3>On the rise</h3>



<p>Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is usually a winter virus that affects primarily young children and the elderly. It all but disappeared earlier during the pandemic. But the five-week moving average of RSV detections in the United States shows that cases of RSV have been rising as governments and businesses lift COVID-19 precautions. The most recent weeks’ detections may increase as more data comes in.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Short and sharp summer outbreaks of RSV — like those seen in Western Australia in December of 2020 — seem to lead to a lower surge later, Barr says. But places where levels of RSV and other seasonal respiratory viruses stay low through the warm months, could turn into hot spots in the fall and winter with a larger-than-normal season.</p>



<p>There is one big exception to that prediction: If the coronavirus is widespread during winter, “it may still keep these other viruses low,” says Richard Webby, a virologist at St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital in Memphis, Tenn.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>&nbsp;If so, that wouldn’t just be because of COVID-19 precautions left in place to help control the coronavirus. At play would also be a phenomenon called <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/covid19-coronavirus-flu-season-fall">viral interference</a> — when one respiratory virus dampens the spread of other viruses (<em>SN: 9/18/20</em>). There are two ways that this can happen: by sickening people and having them stay home — removing them from the population than can be infected at a given school or workplace — or by directly priming infected individuals’ immune system to fight off other viral infections.</p>



<p>“When one virus is there, there&#8217;s a heightened state of general antiviral defenses” in the body, Foxman says. “So you would predict that for a certain … period after somebody has one viral infection, they may be more resistant to getting another viral infection.” Still, this scenario would mean relatively high levels of coronavirus cases in the country — not exactly something to hope for.</p>

<p>“If [I] had to guess what was going to happen, [I&#8217;d say] that some of these other respiratory diseases are going to be more of a problem than influenza when your kids go back to school,” Barr says. “The parainfluenzas, the adenoviruses, RSV — these sorts of viruses are more likely to circulate than influenza.”</p>



<p>That’s partly because the flu vaccine exists, which can help lessen influenza outbreaks. And it’s partly because of the way that the flu spreads and evolves as it moves around the world, experts say, and how that spread seems to be more affected by border closures and reduced travel than other respiratory viruses. Less travel around the world in the last two years has prevented influenza epidemics from spreading out of countries to other places, and the flu remains at very low levels worldwide.</p>



<p>Ultimately, “it&#8217;s a little hard to predict what&#8217;s going to happen, because we have never had this kind of disruption before in the transmission of these viruses,” Foxman says. “But of course, it&#8217;s very interesting to follow it and important to see what happens, because we&#8217;re going to learn a lot.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/brain-ripples-rat-memory-reduce-sugar-levels-metabolism">Ripples in rats’ brains tied to memory may also reduce sugar levels</a></h4>

              
                <p>Ripples of nerve cell activity that lock in memories may have an unexpected job outside of the brain: Dropping blood sugar levels in the body.</p>



<p>Just after a burst of ripples in a rat’s hippocampus, sugar levels elsewhere in the body dipped, new experiments show. The curveball results, published August 11 in <em>Nature</em>, suggest that certain types of <a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-021-03811-w">brain activity and metabolism are entwined</a> in surprising and mysterious ways.</p>



<p>“This paper represents a significant advance in our understanding of how the hippocampus modulates metabolism,” says Elizabeth Gould, a neuroscientist at Princeton University who wasn’t involved in the study.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Neural shudders called sharp-wave ripples zig and zag in the brains of people as they learn new things and <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/electrodes-show-glimpse-memories-emerging-brain">draw memories back up</a> (<em>SN: 8/19/19</em>). Ripples also feature prominently during deep sleep. Sleeping mammals, birds and even lizards known as Australian dragons have these bursts of electrical activity. Sharp-wave ripples are thought to accompany the neural work of transforming short-term knowledge into long-term memories.</p>





<p>Neuroscientist David Tingley wondered whether these signals might also change something outside of the brain. Working with neuroscientist György Buzsáki at New York University Grossman School of Medicine and colleagues, Tingley, now at Harvard University, fitted continuous glucose monitors onto the backs of rats. These devices, used by people with diabetes to keep tabs on sugar levels in the fluid around cells, provide a good proxy for blood sugar levels. The researchers simultaneously measured the rats’ brain waves with electrodes implanted in the hippocampus, a brain structure that plays a key role in memory.</p>



<p>Every so often, electrodes picked up clusters of ripples. About 10 minutes after a bout of ripples, sugar levels in the body fell, the glucose monitors showed. “We saw these dips in the second rat, and the third rat, and the fourth rat,” says Buzsáki. “It was super consistent. The magnitude is small but [the dips] are always there.”</p>



<p>To see if this connection between the ripples and the sugar dips was mere coincidence, the researchers forced nerve cells in the hippocampus to fire in response to light, creating artificial ripples. Sure enough, after a bout of these forced ripples, the rats’ sugar levels dropped.</p>



<p>What’s more, when the researchers jammed the ripples’ downstream signals with a drug that quiets nerve cells in a brain area called the lateral septum, sugar levels did not drop. That suggests these ripples send signals that ping-pong through the brain and ultimately tell the body to reduce its sugar.</p>



<p>“All of this was very surprising,” says Jan Born, a neuroscientist who studies metabolism at the University of Tübingen in Germany. You might expect a busy brain at work to call for more energy, in the form of sugar, not less, says Born, who cowrote a <a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/d41586-021-02122-4">commentary</a> on the new paper in the same issue of <em>Nature</em>. &nbsp;But here, “the brain says to the body, ‘We don’t need so much energy, so go down with your glucose levels.’ Why?” says Born, “It’s difficult to see its function.”</p>



<p>Buzsáki wonders whether these ripples might have evolved initially to aid in metabolism. “They were useful for the body first,” he speculates. As time passed, ripples may have been pulled in on other jobs, such as memory storage.</p>



<p>If this newfound link between brain waves and metabolism exists in people, it might suggest a way to influence sugar levels by tweaking ripples, Buzsáki says, an idea that might prove useful for people with diabetes or other metabolic problems. The hippocampus is deep in the brain, but its activity can be altered via magnetic or electrical jolts to easier-to-reach brain areas. Still, changing ripples for metabolic reasons is a far-off idea, Buzsáki cautions.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/psychology-behavior-human-mind-cognition-mental-health">Psychology has struggled for a century to make sense of the mind</a></h4>

              
                <p class="has-drop-cap" style="font-size:20px">One of the most infamous psychology experiments ever conducted involved a carefully planned form of child abuse. The study rested on a simple scheme that would never get approved or funded today. In 1920, two researchers reported that they had repeatedly startled an unsuspecting infant, who came to be known as Little Albert, to see if he could be conditioned like Pavlov’s dogs.</p>



<p>Psychologist John Watson of Johns Hopkins University and his graduate student Rosalie Rayner viewed their laboratory fearfest as a step toward strengthening a branch of natural science able to predict and control the behavior of people and other animals.</p>



<p>At first, the 9-month-old boy, identified as Albert B., sat placidly when the researchers placed a white rat in front of him. In tests two months later, one researcher presented the rodent, and just as the child brought his hand to pet it, the other scientist stood behind Albert and clanged a metal rod with a hammer. Their goal: to see if a child could be conditioned to associate an emotionally neutral white rat with a scary noise, just as Russian physiologist Ivan Pavlov had trained dogs to associate the meaningless clicks of a metronome with the joy of being fed.</p>



<p>Pavlov’s dogs slobbered at the mere sound of a metronome. Likewise, <a href="http://www.appstate.edu/~steelekm/classes/psy3214/Documents/Watson&amp;Rayner1920.pdf">Little Albert eventually cried and recoiled at the mere sight of a white rat</a>. The boy’s conditioned fear wasn’t confined to rodents. He got upset when presented with other furry things — a rabbit, a dog, a fur coat and a Santa Claus mask with a fuzzy beard.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="alignleft size-full"><img loading="lazy" width="680" height="375" src="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/081421_BB_sn100psych_little-albert.jpg" alt="baby Little Albert crying with a rabbit" class="wp-image-3102427" srcset="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/081421_BB_sn100psych_little-albert.jpg 680w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/081421_BB_sn100psych_little-albert-330x182.jpg 330w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><figcaption><span class="caption wp-caption-3102427">In a questionable experiment published in 1920, researchers conditioned an infant nicknamed Little Albert to fear various furry animals and objects.</span><span class="credit wp-credit-3102427">J.B. Watson</span></figcaption></figure></div>



<p>Crucial details of the Little Albert experiment remain unclear or in dispute, such as who the child was, whether he had any neurological conditions and why the boy was removed from the experiment, possibly by his mother, before the researchers could attempt to reverse his learned fears. Also uncertain is whether he experienced any long-term effects of his experience.</p>



<p>Although experimental psychology originated in Germany in 1879, Watson’s notorious study foreshadowed a messy, contentious approach to the “science of us” that has played out over the last 100 years. Warring scientific tribes armed with clashing assumptions about how people think and behave have struggled for dominance in psychology and other social sciences. Some have achieved great influence and popularity, at least for a while. Others have toiled in relative obscurity. Competing tribes have rarely joined forces to develop or integrate theories about how we think or why we do what we do; such efforts don’t attract much attention.</p>



<p>But Watson, who had a second career as a successful advertising executive, knew how to grab the spotlight. He pioneered a field dubbed behaviorism, the study of people’s external reactions to specific sensations and situations. Only behavior counted in Watson’s science. Unobservable thoughts didn’t concern him.</p>

<p>Even as behaviorism took center stage — Watson wrote a best-selling book on how to raise children based on conditioning principles — some psychologists addressed mental life. American psychologist Edward Tolman concluded that rats learned the spatial layout of mazes by constructing <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/problems-brain-maps">a “cognitive map” of their surroundings</a> (<em>SN: 3/29/47, p. 199</em>). Beginning in the 1910s, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/significance-gestalt">Gestalt psychologists</a> studied how we perceive wholes differently than the sum of their parts, such as, depending on your perspective, seeing either a goblet or the profiles of two faces in the foreground of a drawing (<em>SN: 5/18/29, p. 306</em>).</p>



<p>And starting at the turn of the 20th century, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/freud-still-active">Sigmund Freud, the founder of psychoanalysis,</a> exerted a major influence on the treatment of psychological ailments through his writings on topics such as unconscious conflicts, neuroses and psychoses (<em>SN: 7/9/27, p. 21</em>). Freudian clinicians guided the drafting of the American Psychiatric Association’s first official classification system for mental disorders. Later editions of the psychiatric “bible” dropped Freudian concepts as unscientific — he had based his ideas on analyses of himself and his patients, not on lab studies.</p>



<p>Shortly after Freud’s intellectual star rose, so did that of Harvard University psychologist B.F. Skinner, who could trace his academic lineage back to Watson’s behaviorism. By placing rats and pigeons in conditioning chambers known as Skinner boxes, Skinner studied how the timing and rate of rewards or punishments affect animals’ ability to learn new behaviors. He found, for instance, that regular rewards speed up learning, whereas intermittent rewards produce behavior that’s hard to extinguish in the lab. He also stirred up controversy by calling free will an illusion and imagining a utopian society in which communities doled out rewards to produce well-behaved citizens.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/psychologist-social-engineer">Skinner’s ideas, and behaviorism in general, lost favor by the late 1960s</a> (<em>SN: 9/11/71, p. 166</em>). Scientists began to entertain the idea that computations, or statistical calculations, in the brain might enable thinking.</p>

<p>At the same time, some psychologists suspected that human judgments relied on faulty mental shortcuts rather than computer-like data crunching. Research on allegedly rampant flaws in how people make decisions individually and in social situations shot to prominence in the 1970s and remains popular today. In the last few decades, an opposing line of research has reported that instead, people render good judgments by using simple rules of thumb tailored to relevant situations.</p>



<p>Starting in the 1990s, the science of us branched out in new directions. Progress has been made in studying how emotional problems develop over decades, how people in non-Western cultures think and why deaths linked to despair have steadily risen in the United States. Scientific attention has also been redirected to finding new, more precise ways to define mental disorders.</p>



<p>No unified theory of mind and behavior unites these projects. For now, as social psychologists William Swann of the University of Texas at Austin and Jolanda Jetten of the University of Queensland in Australia <a href="https://labs.la.utexas.edu/swann/files/2017/05/swannjetten-1.pdf">wrote in 2017</a>, perhaps scientists should broaden their perspectives to “witness the numerous striking and ingenious ways that the human spirit asserts itself.”</p>





<h4>Revolution and rationality</h4>



<p>Today’s focus on studying people’s thoughts and feelings as well as their behaviors can be traced to a “cognitive revolution” that began in the mid-20th century.</p>



<p>The rise of increasingly powerful computers motivated the idea that complex programs in the brain guide “information processing” so that we can make sense of the world. These neural programs, or sets of formal rules, provide frameworks for remembering what we’ve done, learning a native language and performing other mental feats, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/brain-machine">a new breed of cognitive and computer scientists argued</a> (<em>SN: 11/26/88, p. 345</em>).</p>



<p>Economists adapted the cognitive science approach to their own needs. They were already convinced that individuals calculate costs and benefits of every transaction in the most self-serving ways possible — or should do so but can’t due to human mental limitations. Financial theorists bought into the latter argument and began creating cost-benefit formulas for investing money that are far too complex for anyone to think up, much less calculate, on their own. Economist Harry Markowitz won the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences in 1990 for his set of mathematical rules, introduced in 1952, to allocate an investor’s money to different assets, with more cash going to better and safer bets.</p>



<p>But in the 1970s, psychologists began conducting studies documenting that people rarely think according to rational rules of logic beloved by economists. Psychologists Daniel Kahneman of Princeton University, who received the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences in 2002, and Amos Tversky of Stanford University founded that area of research, at first called heuristics (meaning mental shortcuts) and biases.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="alignleft size-full"><img loading="lazy" width="680" height="473" src="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/081421_BB_sn100psych_kahneman-tversky.jpg" alt="Amos Tversky and Daniel Kahneman" class="wp-image-3102423" srcset="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/081421_BB_sn100psych_kahneman-tversky.jpg 680w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/081421_BB_sn100psych_kahneman-tversky-551x383.jpg 551w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/081421_BB_sn100psych_kahneman-tversky-647x450.jpg 647w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/081421_BB_sn100psych_kahneman-tversky-267x186.jpg 267w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><figcaption><span class="caption wp-caption-3102423">Amos Tversky (left) and Daniel Kahneman (right) started a popular line of research in the 1970s aimed at uncovering ways in which human decisions go awry.</span><span class="credit wp-credit-3102423">Barbara Tversky</span></figcaption></figure></div>



<p>Kahneman and Tversky popularized the notion that decision makers rely on highly fallible mental shortcuts that can have dire consequences. For instance, people bet themselves into bankruptcy at blackjack tables based on what they easily remember — big winners — rather than on the vast majority of losers. University of Chicago economist Richard Thaler applied that idea to the study of financial behavior in the 1980s. He was awarded the <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/richard-thaler-nobel-economic-sciences">2017 Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences</a> for his contributions to the field of behavioral economics, which incorporated previous heuristics and biases research. Thaler has championed the practice of nudging, in which government and private institutions find ways to prod people to make decisions deemed to be in their best interest.</p>



<p>Better to nudge, behavioral economists argue, than to leave people to their potentially disastrous mental shortcuts. Nudges have been used, for instance, to enroll employees automatically in retirement savings plans unless they opt out. That tactic is aimed at preventing delays in saving money during prime work years that lead to financial troubles later in life.</p>



<p>Another nudge tactic attempts to reduce overeating of sweets and other unhealthy foods, and perhaps rising obesity rates as well, by redesigning cafeterias and grocery stores so that vegetables and other nutritious foods are easiest to see and reach.</p>



<p>As nudging gained in popularity, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/rational-mind-designs">Kahneman and Tversky’s research also stimulated the growth of an opposing research camp</a>, founded in the 1990s by psychologist Gerd Gigerenzer, now director of the Harding Center for Risk Literacy at the University of Potsdam in Germany (<em>SN: 7/13/96, p. 24</em>).</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="alignright size-full"><img loading="lazy" width="680" height="453" src="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/081421_BB_sn100psych_Gigerenzer.jpg" alt="Gerd Gigerenzer" class="wp-image-3102415" srcset="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/081421_BB_sn100psych_Gigerenzer.jpg 680w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/081421_BB_sn100psych_Gigerenzer-575x383.jpg 575w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/081421_BB_sn100psych_Gigerenzer-675x450.jpg 675w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/081421_BB_sn100psych_Gigerenzer-279x186.jpg 279w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><figcaption><span class="caption wp-caption-3102415">In the 1990s, psychologist Gerd Gigerenzer and colleagues launched investigations of simple but powerful decision-making shortcuts.</span><span class="credit wp-credit-3102415">Franz Johann Morgenbesser/Flickr (<a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/2.0/">CC BY-SA 2.0</a>)

&nbsp;</span></figcaption></figure></div>



<p>Gigerenzer and colleagues study simple rules of thumb that, when geared toward crucial cues in real-world situations, work remarkably well for decision making. Their approach builds on ideas on decision making in organizations that won economist Herbert Simon the <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/nobel-prizes-research-impact">1978 Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences</a> (<em>SN: 10/21/78, p. 277</em>).</p>



<p>In the real world, people typically possess limited information and have little time to make decisions, Gigerenzer argues. Precise risks can’t be known in advance or calculated based on what’s happened in the past because many interacting factors can trigger unexpected events in, for example, one’s life or the world economy. Amid so much uncertainty, simple but powerful decision tactics can outperform massive number-crunching operations such as Markowitz’s investment formula. Using 40 years of U.S. stock market data to predict future returns, one study found that simply distributing money evenly among either 25 or 50 stocks usually <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/simple-heresy">yielded more money</a> than 14 complex investment strategies, including Markowitz’s (<em>SN Online: 5/20/11</em>).</p>



<p>Unlike Markowitz’s procedure, dividing funds equally among diverse buys spreads out investment risks without mistaking accidental and random financial patterns in the past for good bets.</p>



<p>Gigerenzer and other investigators of powerful rules of thumb emphasize public education in statistical literacy and effective thinking strategies over nudging schemes. Intended effects of nudges are often weak and short-lived, they contend. Unintended effects can also occur, such as regrets over having accepted the standard investment rate in a company’s savings plan because it turns out to be too low for one’s retirement needs. “Nudging people without educating them means infantilizing the public,” Gigerenzer wrote in 2015.</p>



<h4>Moved to do harm</h4>



<p>As studies of irrational decision making took off around 50 years ago, so did a field of research with especially troubling implications. Social psychologists put volunteers into experimental situations that, in their view, exposed a human weakness for following the crowd and obeying authority. With memories of the Nazi campaign to exterminate Europe’s Jews still fresh, two such experiments became famous for showing the apparent ease with which people abide by heinous orders and abuse power.</p>



<p>First, Yale psychologist Stanley Milgram reported in 1963 that 65 percent of volunteers obeyed an experimenter’s demands to deliver what they thought were increasingly powerful and possibly lethal electric shocks to an unseen person — who was actually working with Milgram — as punishments for erring on word-recall tests. This widely publicized finding appeared to <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/shocking-obedience-found-children">unveil a frightening willingness of average folks to carry out the commands of evil authorities</a> (<em>SN: 8/20/77, p. 117</em>).</p>



<p>A disturbing follow-up to Milgram’s work was the 1971 Stanford Prison Experiment, which psychologist Philip Zimbardo halted after six days due to escalating chaos among participants. Male college students assigned to play guards in a simulated prison had increasingly abused mock prisoners, stripping them naked and denying them food. Student “prisoners” became withdrawn and depressed.</p>



<p>Zimbardo argued that extreme social situations, such as assuming the role of a prison guard, will overwhelm self-control. Even mild-mannered college kids can get harsh when clad in guards’ uniforms and turned loose on their imprisoned peers, he said.</p>

<p>Milgram’s and Zimbardo’s projects contained human drama and conflict that had widespread, and long-lasting, public appeal. A 1976 made-for-television movie based on Milgram’s experiment, titled <em>The Tenth Level</em>, starred William Shatner. A 2010 movie inspired by the Stanford Prison Experiment, simply called <em>The Experiment</em>, starred Academy Award winners Adrien Brody and Forest Whitaker.</p>



<p>Despite the lasting cultural impact of the obedience-to-authority and prison experiments, some researchers have questioned Milgram’s and Zimbardo’s conclusions. Milgram conducted 23 obedience experiments, although only one was publicized. Overall, volunteers usually delivered the harshest shocks when encouraged to identify with Milgram’s scientific mission to understand human behavior. No one followed the experimenter’s order, “You have no other choice, you must go on.”</p>



<div class="wp-block-sciencenews-content-sidebar alignright">
<h3>Schools of thought</h3>



<p>Researchers have taken a variety of often conflicting, sometimes complementary approaches to the study of human thought and behavior.</p>



<p><strong>1899 — Freudian psychoanalysis</strong>: Study and treatment of unconscious mental conflicts</p>



<p><strong>1912 —</strong> <strong>Gestalt psychology:</strong> Study of unified perceptions rather than their parts</p>



<p><strong>1913 —</strong> <strong>John Watson’s behaviorism:</strong> Study of the prediction and control of human behavior</p>



<p><strong>1938 —</strong> <strong>B.F. Skinner’s behaviorism</strong>: Study of behaviors conditioned by rewards and punishments</p>



<p><strong>1956 —</strong> <strong>Cognitive revolution</strong>: Study of the mind using artificial intelligence and computers</p>



<p><strong>1971 —</strong> <strong>Heuristics and biases (Kahneman and Tversky)</strong>: Study of irrational, mistaken decisions</p>



<p><strong>1999 —</strong> <strong>Ecological rationality (Gigerenzer)</strong>: Study of how mental shortcuts work in the right settings</p>



<p><strong>2010 —</strong> <strong>WEIRD/cross-cultural movement</strong>: Study of how people outside Western cultures think</p>
</div>



<p>Indeed, people who follow orders to harm others are most likely to do so because they identify with a collective cause that morally justifies their actions, argued psychologists S. Alexander Haslam of the University of Queensland and Stephen Reicher of the University of St. Andrews in Scotland 40 years after the famous obedience study. Rather than blindly following orders, Milgram’s volunteers cooperated with an experimenter when they viewed participation as scientifically important — even if, as many later told Milgram, they didn’t want to deliver shocks and felt bad after doing so.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/rwanda-genocide-psychology-murder">Data from the 1994 ethnic genocide in the African nation of Rwanda</a> supported that revised take on Milgram’s experiment (<em>SN: 8/19/17, p. 22</em>). In a 100-day span, members of Rwanda’s majority Hutu population killed roughly 800,000 ethnic Tutsis. Researchers who later examined Rwandan government data on genocide perpetrators estimated that only about 20 percent of Hutu men and a much smaller percentage of Hutu women seriously injured or killed at least one person during the bloody episode. Most Hutus rejected pressure from political and community leaders to join the slaughter.</p>



<p>Neither did Zimbardo’s prisoners and guards passively accept their assigned roles. Prisoners at first challenged and rebelled against guards. When prisoners learned from Zimbardo that they would have to forfeit any money they’d already earned if they left before the experiment ended, their solidarity plummeted, and the guards crushed their resistance. Still, a majority of guards refused to wield power tyrannically, favoring tough-but-fair or friendly tactics.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/err-human">In a second prison experiment conducted by Haslam and Reicher in 2001</a>, guards were allowed to develop their own prison rules rather than being told to make prisoners feel powerless, as Zimbardo had done. In a rapid chain of events, conflict broke out between one set of guards and prisoners who formed a communal group that shared power and another with guards and prisoners who wanted to institute authoritarian rule. Morale in the communal group sank rapidly. Haslam stopped the experiment after eight days. “It’s the breakdown of groups and resulting sense of powerlessness that creates the conditions under which tyranny can triumph,” Haslam concluded.</p>



<p>Milgram’s and Zimbardo’s experiments set the stage for further research alleging that people can’t control certain harmful attitudes and behaviors. A test of the speed with which individuals identify positive or negative words and images after being shown white and Black faces has become popular as a marker of unconscious racial bias. Some investigators regard that test as a window into hidden prejudice — and implicit bias training has become common in many workplaces. But other scientists have questioned whether it truly taps into underlying bigotry. Likewise, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/showdown-sex-gap">stereotype threat</a>, the idea that people automatically act consistently with negative beliefs about their race, sex or other traits when subtly reminded of those stereotypes, has also attracted academic supporters and critics.</p>



<div class="wp-block-sciencenews-content-sidebar">
<h3>Diagnostic disarray</h3>



<p>From 1952 to 1980, the <em>Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</em>, or DSM, divided mental ailments into less-debilitating neuroses and more-debilitating psychoses. Other conditions were grouped under psychosomatic illnesses, personality disorders and brain or nervous system problems. Architects of an update published in 1980, DSM-III, wanted psychiatry to become a biological science, so they emphasized medications over psychotherapy for treating mental disorders. </p>



<p>In 2010, scientists dissatisfied with DSM’s often fuzzy, symptom-based definitions of mental disorders rebelled and tried to define mental conditions based on brain and behavioral measures. One such approach involves a still-preliminary measure of a susceptibility to mental illness in general, called a p score. This score is thought to reflect a person’s “internalizing” liability to develop anxiety and mood disorders, an “externalizing” liability, such as to abuse drugs and break laws, and a propensity to delusions and other forms of psychotic thinking. Researchers hope eventually to use p scores to evaluate how well psychotherapies and psychoactive medications treat and prevent mental disorders. <em>— Bruce Bower</em></p>

<h4>Improving lives and life spans</h4>



<p>It has taken a public health crisis to stimulate a level of cooperation across disciplines within and even outside the social sciences rarely reached in the last century. After a long stretch of increasing longevity, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/blog/science-ticker/us-life-expectancy-drops-second-year">life spans of Americans have declined in recent years</a>, fueled by drug overdoses and other “deaths of despair” among poor and working-class people plagued by job losses and dim futures.</p>



<p>Economists, psychologists, psychiatrists, sociologists, epidemiologists and physicians have begun to explore potential reasons for recent longevity losses, with an eye toward stemming a rising tide of early deaths.</p>



<p>Two Princeton University economists, Anne Case and Angus Deaton, highlighted this disturbing trend in 2015. After combing through U.S. death statistics, Case and Deaton observed that <a href="https://www.pnas.org/content/112/49/15078">mortality rose sharply among middle-aged, non-Hispanic white people starting in the late 1990s</a>. In particular, white, working-class people ages 45 to 54 were increasingly drinking themselves to death with alcohol, succumbing to opioid overdoses and committing suicide.</p>



<p>Job losses that resulted as mining declined and manufacturing plants moved offshore, high health care costs, disintegrating families and other stresses rendered more people than ever susceptible to deaths of despair, the economists argued. A similar trend had stoked deaths among inner-city Black people in the 1970s and 1980s.</p>



<p>If Case and Deaton were right, then researchers urgently <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/deaths-of-despair-depression-mental-health-covid-19-pandemic">needed to find a way to measure despair</a> (<em>SN: 1/30/21, p. 16</em>). Two big ideas guided their efforts. First, don’t assume depression or other diagnoses correspond to despair. Instead, treat despair as a downhearted state of mind. Tragic life circumstances beyond one’s control, from sudden unemployment to losses of loved ones felled by COVID-19, can trigger demoralization and grief that have nothing to do with preexisting depression or any other mental disorder.</p>



<p>Second, study people throughout their lives to untangle how despair develops and prompts early deaths. It’s reasonable to wonder, for instance, if opioid addiction more often afflicts young adults who have experienced despair since childhood, versus those who first faced despair in the previous year.</p>



<p>One preliminary despair scale consists of seven indicators of this condition, including feeling hopeless and helpless, feeling unloved and worrying often. This scale has shown promise as a way to identify those who are likely to think about or attempt suicide and to abuse opioids and other drugs.</p>



<p>Deaths of despair belong to a broader public health and economic crisis, concluded a 12-member National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine committee in 2021. Since the 1990s, drug overdoses, alcohol abuse, suicides and obesity-related conditions <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/covid-19-premature-deaths-mortality-obesity-drug-overdose">caused the deaths of nearly 6.7 million U.S. adults ages 25 to 64</a>, the committee found. Whether obesity is rarely or often associated with despair is an open question.</p>

<h3>Self-harm&nbsp;</h3>



<p>Social scientists are exploring reasons for rising numbers of “deaths of despair” in the United States, and the rising role played by drug overdoses, as compared with alcohol abuse and suicide. </p>

<p>Deaths from those causes hit racial minorities and working-class people of all races especially hard from the start. The COVID-19 pandemic further inflamed that mortality trend because people with underlying health conditions were especially vulnerable to the virus.</p>



<p>Perhaps findings with such alarming public health implications can inform policies that go viral, in the best sense of that word. Obesity-prevention programs for young people, expanded drug abuse treatment and stopping the flow of illegal opioids into the United States would be a start.</p>



<p>Whatever the politicians decide, the science of us has come a long way from Watson and Rayner instilling ratty fears in an unsuspecting infant. If Little Albert were alive today, he might smile, no doubt warily, at researchers working to extinguish real-life anguish.</p>

                <p><em>By</em> <a href="https://emmayoung.net/">Emma Young</a></p>



<p>Do you think a ladybird is more beautiful than a locust? If you do, you probably also feel that the ladybird is &#8220;purer&#8221; than the locust, and this leads you to believe that it possesses more inherent moral worth. This, at least, is the conclusion of a <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/01461672211023648">new paper</a> that inextricably links perceptions of purity, beauty, and moral standing for people as well as animals, and even landscapes and buildings.</p>



<span id="more-43207"></span>



<p>Earlier studies have found that the more we feel an entity has a mind, and is capable of sensations and feelings, the greater its moral standing  —  that is, we think that there is a stronger moral aspect to decisions about to how it should be treated. Aesthetic judgements have an impact, too — people and animals perceived to be more beautiful tend to be perceived as having a greater moral standing. Now the new work, published in <em>Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin</em>, on a total of more than 1,600 people, finds that perceptions of purity should be added into these equations.</p>



<p>In the first of six studies, Christoph Klebl at the University of Melbourne and colleagues used a measure of &#8220;desire to protect&#8221; a number of animals as an indicator of the moral standing ascribed to each. The participants also rated the degree to which each &#8220;ugly&#8221; or &#8220;beautiful&#8221; fish, butterfly or bird (examples of each were selected by the researchers) made them think of something &#8220;pure&#8221;, as well as how useful and inspiring they were, and how much they made them feel disgusted, afraid or sad.</p>



<p>Purity perceptions emerged as being relevant to the desire to protect. In fact, there was no <em>direct</em> effect of beauty (vs ugliness) on moral standing; instead, animals judged to be more beautiful were also judged to be more pure, and it was this that led participants to see them as having greater moral standing. (Perceptions of how “useful” the animals were also relevant).</p>



<p>A second study involved 12 photos of human faces, half previously judged to be attractive and half unattractive. It produced very similar results: perceptions of beauty were linked to purity judgements, and so to moral standing scores.</p>



<p>Next, the team turned their attention to inanimate targets. They found that, again, participants judged &#8220;beautiful&#8221; vs &#8220;ugly&#8221; lakes, mountains and even buildings to be &#8220;purer&#8221; and to be more deserving of protection, which the team again interpreted as reflecting greater moral standing. Again, though, perceived utility (and, for buildings, judgements of how inspiring each example was) did also influence the results.</p>



<p>If you’re wondering whether a desire to protect a lake, say, really reflects judgements of moral standing, the researchers did, too. Follow-up studies used a more explicit moral standing scale for the animals and buildings included in the earlier studies (rather than the &#8220;protection deservedness&#8221; scale). Participants had to rate the extent to which harming the animal or building would be morally wrong, for example. And again, beautiful animals and buildings were seen as more pure, and this lead to higher moral standing scores.</p>



<p>“The present studies provided empirical evidence that people attribute moral standing to a wide range of beautiful targets, including both sentient beings (humans and animals) and non-sentient entities (landscapes and buildings)”, the researchers note. Beyond that, “we provided empirical evidence for purity intuitions as a psychological mechanism through which people view beautiful entities as possessing moral standing.”</p>



<p>Conservation organisations are sometimes criticised for picking attractive flagship species or sites. But this work does suggest that the more beautiful the threatened target, the more strongly people will feel that those threats are morally wrong. If an &#8220;ugly&#8221; species in dire need of help shares a threatened habitat with a more attractive species, then focusing on the cute one could well be the sensible approach. The results suggest that focusing on the purity of other at-risk targets could be useful, too. Conservation efforts might perhaps highlight the purity of a building’s Modernist style, say, or the pure, original nature of an old-growth forest. “Our findings… suggest novel and practical avenues through which to leverage moral concern for a wide range of targets such as animals, plants, or works of architecture,” the team concludes.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coronavirus-covid-kids-school-return-parents-questions">6 answers to parents’ COVID-19 questions as kids return to school</a></h4>

              
                <p class="has-drop-cap" style="font-size:20px">Last fall, my husband and I managed our children’s first run-of-the-mill cold masquerading as COVID-19 with ease. We took them for the requisite tests and waited for the results. Meanwhile, the kids stayed home from school, using screens to answer math problems or watch educational programming. At least schools in Vermont, where we live, were mostly open, we said. At least the kids were getting some in-person education and social interaction. At least we were getting some uninterrupted work time.</p>



<p>Then we got our first “close contact” call from school, informing us that someone who had been near one of our kids had tested positive for COVID-19. We were told to wait seven days after exposure and then get a test or wait 10 days with no test before sending them back to school. Soon came the second call. Then a mystery case of diarrhea. The missed school days started piling up. Our ease became uneasy.</p>



<p>Elementary schools in our area remained open, initially for two days and then four, for the entire 2020–2021 school year. Even now, after a chaotic year where each kid missed weeks of in-person school, I remain thankful for the schools’ heroic efforts to maintain some semblance of normal during a very abnormal time. But as schools across the country reopen this fall, our rocky experience serves as an example of what other families could go through.</p>



<div class="wp-block-sciencenews-content-sidebar alignleft">
<h3>COVID-19: Back to school</h3>





<p>This story is one in a series looking at what to expect as U.S. children return to in-person school.</p>

</div>



<p>“Large numbers of students are going to be vulnerable to frequent quarantines,” says pediatric infectious diseases specialist Adam Hersh of the University of Utah in Salt Lake City. “That is going to be incredibly disruptive.”</p>



<p>In some ways, opening schools this year is even more precarious than last fall. The <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/delta-variant-studies-cdc-coronavirus-covid-pandemic">super contagious delta variant</a> has become the dominant coronavirus strain across the United States (<em>SN: 7/30/21</em>). Some medical experts are predicting an uptick of colds and other seasonal respiratory illnesses that have symptoms mirroring those of COVID-19, which could mean even more missed school as kids wait for the all clear. And few states are requiring protective masks, even for unvaccinated students, while several states have even banned school districts from issuing mask mandates.</p>



<p>As children return to school, here are answers to some common questions parents may have. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<h4>How can children be kept safe in the classroom?</h4>



<p>Masks, masks and masks. That’s especially true for the unvaccinated under-12 set. And given low vaccination rates for teenagers across the country, masking remains the best mitigation strategy even for middle and high schoolers, Hersh says.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Masks also make other, harder-to-implement mitigation strategies less vital, say Hersh and others. For instance, last fall, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommended spacing children in school at least six feet apart as one COVID-19 precaution. But newer evidence suggests less distancing, or even no distancing, is safe, as long as everyone wears a mask.</p>



<p>“Almost every new study that comes out looking at spacing has shown the three feet of spacing to be just as protective as the six feet of distancing” when there are masks, says John Bailey. He is a domestic policy expert with the American Enterprise Institute, a think tank based in Washington, D.C., that researches education policy and other public policy–related areas.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>For instance, Dana Ramirez, a pediatrician at Children’s Hospital of the King’s Daughters in Norfolk, Va., and colleagues tracked nearly 1,200 students in grades one to 12 attending a single, private school in Virginia from August 24, 2020, to March 19, 2021. The roughly 460 students who rode buses sat two to a seat — about 2.5 feet apart — and wore masks. &nbsp;Regular COVID-19 testing — every two weeks at first and then weekly — identified 39 students who rode the buses while infected. But the researchers, whose findings appear July 20 in the <em>Journal of School Health,</em> identified <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/josh.13058">zero cases of transmission</a>.</p>



<p>Similarly in North Carolina, researchers have been tracking COVID-19 precautions and rates of transmission in the state schools since July 2020. That effort is part of the <a href="https://abcsciencecollaborative.org/">ABC Science Collaborative</a>, a multistate partnership where scientists and medical doctors collect data within schools and then inform educational leaders about best pandemic practices. It now includes 100 of North Carolina’s 150 school districts and over a million staff and students. This spring, with so many children back in school in North Carolina, some school districts reduced required distancing to less than three feet. But even at such close proximity, and with many classrooms lacking adequate ventilation, universal masking kept the <a href="https://abcsciencecollaborative.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/ABCs-Final-Report-June-2021.06-esig-DB-KZ-6-29-21.pdf">odds of a COVID-positive person transmitting the virus</a> to a close contact at less than 1 percent, the researchers note in a June 30 report to lawmakers in North Carolina.</p>



<p>As for classrooms, if “you have to cram 30 people into a really, really tiny room and much less than three feet apart, as long as everyone is masked, that’s cool,” says Kanecia Zimmerman, a pediatrician and epidemiologist at Duke University and cochair of the ABC Science Collaborative.</p>



<h4>Besides masking, what else can schools do?</h4>



<p>Deploy widespread preventive screening of all students, whether symptomatic or not, says pediatrician Lynn Silver of Berkeley, Calif. Silver is referring to rapid antigen tests, which deliver results in 15 minutes. Children as young as age 3 or 4 can administer these tests themselves, Silver says. And <a href="https://perkinelmer-appliedgenomics.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Federal-Resources-Supporting-School-Screening-Testing-Update-22-June_v2_header_2.pdf">federal funding is available</a> to interested districts.</p>



<p>Silver directs the Safely Opening Schools project, a collaboration between the Public Health Institute, headquartered in Oakland, Calif., and the California Department of Public Health. She headed a screening project from January to July across 10 school districts in five California counties. Schools generally tested students, who all wore masks, once or twice per week, and administered almost 100,000 tests.</p>

<h4>
<a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/editors-picks/2019-novel-coronavirus-outbreak">See all our coverage of the coronavirus outbreak</a>
</h4>
</aside>



<p>The team found that positive cases within schools remained extremely low, with only a <a href="https://www.phi.org/press/rapid-covid-19-testing-proves-a-key-tool-for-safer-in-person-learning-in-california-schools/">0.1 percent of over 27,000 tests in the pilot study coming back positive</a>. Subsequent PCR testing, a more accurate but slower testing method, revealed few false positives. The screenings also helped ease parents’ concerns, with some 90 percent saying that the tests helped them feel more comfortable with in-person schooling.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Screening is particularly valuable in elementary schools where all the kids are unvaccinated,” Silver says. And the tests are considerably more effective at identifying positive cases than current protocols, such as symptom and temperature checks.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Still, this sort of regular screening is labor-intensive. Caregivers must consent to their children being screened. Trained staffers are needed to administer the tests and screening takes time away from education, both Hersh and Zimmerman say. &nbsp;</p>



<p>“Screening becomes all the more important in a setting where masks are not going to be required or used at high rates,” Hersh says. But “I don’t think you could choose screening over masks and expect that you could keep the school environment safe.” &nbsp;</p>



<h4>Are disruptive, “close-contact” quarantines necessary if everyone is wearing masks?</h4>



<p>That’s ultimately a decision left up to school districts and states. But the CDC offers guidance.</p>



<p>The agency defines a “close contact” as “someone who was within six feet of an infected person … for a cumulative of 15 minutes or more over a 24-hour period.” &nbsp;And the CDC currently recommends that close contacts who are not fully vaccinated, which would include anyone under age 12 for now, should quarantine at home from seven to 14 days after exposure.</p>



<p>When a child or adult in a classroom tests positive, that can mean the entire class has to quarantine and test before returning to school. My son’s third-grade class and my daughter’s kindergarten class both shut down repeatedly for this very reason. Similarly, Zimmerman and her team found that a single positive case within a given school triggered quarantines for over 100 people.</p>



<p>But because COVID-19 transmission in schools is so low when everyone wears masks, the CDC should consider eliminating quarantine recommendations in masked environments to avoid unnecessary disruptions, Zimmerman says. “My hope is the CDC will continue to move in the way of existing science.”</p>



<p>Absent such a change, this school year could become very fragmented, especially with remote school less available than in 2020 in some places, says epidemiologist and demographer Jennifer Dowd of the University of Oxford. “It will be back like the old days when kids just missed school.” &nbsp;</p>



<h4>What if masks are optional at our child’s school?</h4>



<p>The CDC recently changed its guidance to recommend that <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/cdc-covid-coronavirus-masks-indoors-vaccinated-people-pandemic">everyone in schools should wear a mask</a>, regardless of vaccination status (<em>SN: 7/27/21</em>). The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends that everyone older than age 2 wears masks in school and care settings this fall.</p>



<p>But the decision on masking in schools is ultimately left to the states themselves, with less than a dozen mandating masks as of early August. In Florida, Texas, Arizona and a handful of other states, officials have expressly forbidden school districts from mandating masks in classrooms, even for children too young to be vaccinated.</p>



<p>That reality changes best practices entirely, Zimmerman says. Without universal masking, all the other COVID-19 precautions become essential, including six-foot distancing, those dreaded quarantines for close contacts, widespread and regular screening for teachers, staff and students and even limiting or canceling sports and <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coronavirus-covid-music-wind-instruments-spread-transmission">music</a>, activities that have shown conducive to high rates of COVID-19 spread, she says (<em>SN: 8/6/21</em>).</p>



<p>But some states are neither requiring masks nor other measures like quarantines for close contacts.&nbsp; For instance, in Texas, keeping a child who has been exposed to COVID-19 home is a choice, not a requirement. “Parents of students who are determined to be close contacts of an individual with COVID-19 <a href="https://tea.texas.gov/sites/default/files/covid/SY-20-21-Public-Health-Guidance.pdf">may opt to keep their students at home</a> during the recommended stay-at-home period,” reads an Aug. 5 statement from the Texas Education Agency.</p>



<p>These political realities can make for complicated decision making for parents and caregivers living in such states. For instance, data on rates of transmission when some children are masked and others aren’t not available. But children in such situations should still mask, Hersh says.</p>





<h4>Does the delta variant change things?</h4>



<p>Most experts concur that even with the highly transmissible delta variant of the coronavirus circulating in the country, schools should remain open. But COVID-19 mitigation measures become that much more important.</p>



<p>“Schools were relatively safe places, even during the height of the pandemic. We don’t want to tell anyone to keep their kid home out of fear. But they can be made safer by strong masking policies and by use of testing,” Silver says.</p>



<p>Evidence from school this summer in Los Angeles suggests that spread even with the delta variant remained relatively low with universal masking and regular screenings, says Daniel Benjamin, a pediatrician at Duke University and Zimmerman’s cochair at the ABC Science Collaborative.&nbsp;The <em>Los Angeles Times</em> reported August 4 that 44,000 staffers and K–12 students attended classes from late June to late July. At&nbsp;the beginning of summer school, 1 in 1,000 tests came back positive for the coronavirus compared with 6 in 1,000 at the end of the program. Most people who contracted COVID-19 did so <a href="https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2021-08-04/coronavirus-infections-increased-in-lausd-summer-school-but-affected-a-tiny-percentage">outside of school</a>, the paper reports. This case study suggests that delta isn’t better at evading masks than other variants, Benjamin says.</p>



<p>Dowd concurs. “Delta does seem way more transmissible but … it can’t defy the laws of physics.”</p>



<h4>What should we do when our kid gets a cold?</h4>



<p>Medical experts worry that the pandemic’s protracted period of social distancing could make children more susceptible to colds and other common respiratory infections this fall and winter. Worse, there’s no surefire way to distinguish between cold and COVID-19 symptoms.</p>



<p>For that reason, “it’s never a bad idea for a symptomatic individual to get tested,” Hersh says. &nbsp;</p>



<p>But for unvaccinated children, all those sniffles could add up to a lot of missed school as kids wait for a negative COVID-19 test result. Last school year, it typically took two to four days to receive my kids’ PCR test results.&nbsp;</p>



<p>To avoid contributing to the spread of these other respiratory diseases, “I hope parents are a little more sensitive about keeping kids home if they’re sick,” Dowd says. But, she adds, “for so many reasons, that’s not always practical. Kids can have sniffles for months on end.”</p>



<p>One bright spot this year, potentially, is the widespread availability of rapid antigen tests. While these tests can deliver false negatives in asymptomatic individuals, they are <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/69/wr/mm695152a3.htm">almost 100 percent accurate</a> at identifying COVID-19 in symptomatic individuals, according to a Jan. 1 study in <em>Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report</em>. For that reason, Dowd and others recommend that parents keep some of those tests at home. But they can get pricey. My local pharmacy sells two-packs for around $20 to $25. Schools, though, can utilize federal funding to stock those tests and use them when a kid shows up with a stuffy nose.</p>



<p>I used the experts’ advice immediately. In mid-July, my son woke up with a scratchy throat and we went to the clinic for a PCR test. His thankfully negative result took 48 hours to come in, resulting in two days of missed camp and the all too familiar work-parenting juggle. By the time my daughter got sick a few days later, though, I had purchased the rapid antigen tests. Fifteen minutes later, I had her negative results in hand. Camp was a go.&nbsp;</p>

                <p><em>By</em> <a href="https://twitter.com/mattbwarren">Matthew Warren</a></p>



<p>“Trust in the science” is the kind of refrain commonly uttered by well-meaning individuals looking to promote positive, scientifically-backed change, such as encouraging action against climate change or improving uptake of vaccines. The hope is that if people are encouraged to trust science, they will not be duped by those who are promoting the opposite agenda — one which often flies in the face of scientific evidence. But are people actually less likely to fall for misinformation when they have trust in science?</p>



<p>Yes and no, <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0022103121000871?dgcid=rss_sd_all">according to a new a study</a> in the <em>Journal of Experimental Social Psychology</em>. Thomas C O’Brien and colleagues from the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign find that people with greater trust in science are generally less likely to believe misinformation. But when that misinformation is presented with scientific-sounding content to back it up, they become more easily duped by it.</p>



<span id="more-43196"></span>



<p>In the first study, 532 online participants read an article about the “Valza virus”, which stated that the virus had been created as a bioweapon in a government lab and subsequently covered up. The article was written informally, in a style meant to imitate real online posts made by conspiracy theorists. In one condition, the article cited scientists who said that studies in their own lab proved that there had been a conspiracy; in the other, the article instead quoted activists.</p>



<p>Participants then answered questions about how much they believed the article (e.g. to what extent they agreed it was “credible” or “probably true”) and whether they felt it should be shared with a class studying current affairs. (They also answered other questions about their comprehension of the text, in order to obscure the purpose of the study). Finally, participants rated their own trust in science, responding to statements like “scientific theories are trustworthy”, and answered questions that probed their own understanding of scientific methodology.</p>



<p>The team found that, overall, people with a greater trust in science and/or a stronger understanding of methodology were less likely to believe the conspiracy theory. But the article’s content made a difference: people who had a high trust in science were more likely to believe the article if it had quoted scientists than if it had not. Similarly, this group was more likely to say that the article should be shared with the current affairs class if it had apparently scientific content. For people with lower levels of trust in science, whether or not the article had cited scientists made no difference to their beliefs or intentions to share it.</p>



<p>A subsequent study looked at people&#8217;s belief in a conspiracy theory about genetically modified foods, and this time used real articles and pictures from websites. All participants read that genetically modified foods caused tumours, and that this was being covered up. In one condition, they saw articles that referred to an actual scientific paper which supported the theory (and which, unknown to participants, has since been heavily criticised and retracted). In the other condition, they again read arguments by activists, without any scientific content.</p>



<p>The results were the same: although, overall, people who trusted in science were less likely to believe this conspiracy theory, their levels of belief increased when the article contained supposedly scientific content.</p>



<p>In a final study, the team found that people were less likely to believe the conspiracy about genetically modified foods when they had first been asked to think about times when it is important to critically evaluate evidence, compared to when they had been asked to think of times when science had benefited humanity.</p>



<p>The research suggests that trust in science can actually <em>increase</em> people’s vulnerability to pseudoscience, the authors write. Broad campaigns to promote trust in science may therefore not be that useful; instead, it may be more beneficial to promote critical analysis skills.</p>



<p>That said, there is clearly some benefit to trusting science: people with low trust in science tended to believe the conspiracy theories regardless of their content, while those with high trust only showed a tendency to believe them if they contained some (pseudo)scientific content. So it seems likely that those broad campaigns could still have some positive effects. Still, to help people spot misinformation it seems important to teach them to critically evaluate evidence and understand that science isn&#8217;t infallible.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/wind-farm-windbreak-turbine-speed-power-output">Windbreaks, surprisingly, could help wind farms boost power output</a></h4>

              
                <p>Windbreaks may sound like a counterintuitive idea for boosting the performance of a wind turbine. But physicists report that low walls that block wind could actually help wind farms produce more power.</p>



<p>Scientists already knew that the output of a single wind turbine could be improved with a windbreak. While windbreaks slow wind speed close to the ground, above the height of the windbreak, wind speeds actually increase as air rushes over the top. But for large wind farms, there’s a drawback. A windbreak’s wake slows the flow of air as it travels farther through the rows of turbines. That could suggest that windbreaks would be a wash for wind farms with many turbines.</p>



<p>But by striking a balance between these competing effects, windbreaks placed in front of each turbine can increase power output, new computer simulations suggest. It comes down to the windbreaks’ dimensions. Squat, wide barriers are the way to go, according to a simulated wind farm with six rows of turbines. To optimize performance, windbreaks should be a tenth the height of the turbine and at least five times the width of the blades, physicists report July 30 in <em>Physical Review Fluids</em>. Such an arrangement could <a href="https://journals.aps.org/prfluids/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevFluids.6.074611">increase the total power by about 10 percent</a>, the researchers found. That’s the equivalent of adding an additional turbine, on average, for every 10 in a wind farm.</p>



<p>In the simulations, the wind always came from the same direction, suggesting the technique might be useful in locations where wind tends to blow one way, such as coastal regions. Future studies could investigate how this technique might apply in places where wind direction varies.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/covid-school-kids-lost-education-learning-gap">What kids lost when COVID-19 upended school</a></h4>

              
                <p class="has-drop-cap" style="font-size:20px">At the start of a school year, kids usually show up with oversized backpacks stocked with fresh pencils, crisp notebooks and snacks. This back-to-school season, many children will carry extra baggage.</p>



<p>Eighteen months of an unprecedented pandemic turned routines — including going to school — topsy-turvy. This fall, many kids are heading to their new classrooms toting traumas, worries and gaps in their learning.</p>



<p>What’s more, schoolchildren are returning as the pandemic is once again shifting the ground under our feet. Infections driven by the more contagious delta variant of the coronavirus are putting new twists on questions over how to keep kids learning while still protecting unvaccinated children from illness. These burdens may profoundly change yet another school year.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<div class="wp-block-sciencenews-content-sidebar alignleft">
<h3>COVID-19: Back to school</h3>





<p>This story is one in a series looking at what to expect as U.S. children return to in-person school.</p>



<ul><li><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coronavirus-covid-kids-schools-reopening-cases">Schools are reopening. COVID-19 is still here.

</div>



<p>This year comes on the heels of one already marked by losses big and small. When school buildings abruptly closed in the spring of 2020 and school shifted online, many children lost regular time spent together with friends and teachers. Kids missed out on gym class, organized sports and time to goof around at recess. Some kids even lost their voices, digitally silenced by exasperated teachers doing their best to corral rambunctious students in virtual classrooms. “I’m muting you,” these kids were told.</p>



<p>But every student had their own personal pandemic experience. “You can’t generalize,” says Pedro Noguera, dean of the education school at the University of Southern California in Los Angeles. Half of the kids in the United States went to in-person school by the end of 2020, either full-time or on a hybrid schedule. Faced with closed schools, some kids instead had private teachers and learning bubbles. Others muddled along on their own, without solid internet access or a quiet place to sit.</p>



<p>Too many kids who rely on schools as a safety net went without consistent meals and regular check-ins from adults. More than 1.5 million kids globally <a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(21)01253-8/fulltext">lost a parent, live-in grandparent or other live-in relative</a> to the pandemic, scientists estimated July 20 in the <em>Lancet</em>. School counselors had harder times reaching kids.</p>



<p>These pandemic losses were not spread evenly. Existing inequities <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coronavirus-covid-19-creative-school-plans-students-inequities">deepened</a> during the pandemic (<em>SN: 9/8/20</em>). Children from Black and Hispanic communities, and other traditionally underserved groups of kids, suffered some of the biggest losses.</p>

<p>Despite the variation, a patchwork of new data is beginning to put numbers to the scope of the problems that teachers, school administrators and families will face as students return to school. Understanding these challenges is a step toward helping kids come back to the classroom and, ultimately, thrive, says Kathleen Ethier, a social and behavioral scientist at the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. “Maybe one of the positive take-home messages from this past year and a half,” she says, “is that we understand now just how important school is.”</p>



<h3>Learning loss</h3>



<p>Getting a measure of academic performance that applies to all kids across the United States is tough. But early in the pandemic, students’ test scores hinted at the academic blows that were to come.</p>



<p>Comparing previous test score changes of kids in California to the changes from fall of 2019 to the winter of 2020 showed an <a href="https://edpolicyinca.org/publications/covid-19-impacts-student-learning">overall academic lag</a>. “On average, kids are two to two-and-a-half months behind where we would expect they would have been if COVID hadn’t happened,” says learning science expert Libby Pier of Education Analytics, a nonprofit based in Madison, Wis. Considering that a normal school year is nine months long, “that’s a quarter to a third of the school year they missed out on.”</p>



<p>The pandemic, of course, didn’t end in 2020; measures of academic slipping got worse as time went on. Elementary school students across the United States finished the 2020–2021 school year an average of five months behind in math and four months behind in reading, an <a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/public-and-social-sector/our-insights/covid-19-and-education-the-lingering-effects-of-unfinished-learning">analysis</a> from the analytics firm McKinsey &amp; Company, headquartered in New York City, shows. Those numbers, described in a July 27 report, don’t reflect all students. The analysis counted results only from kids who were in schools to take the tests; kids at home might have fared worse.</p>

</div>



<p>The learning lag was most <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coronavirus-covid-19-creative-school-plans-students-inequities">pronounced in children from underserved communities</a>: those who are Hispanic, Black, economically disadvantaged or learning English (<em>SN</em>: 9/8/20). Students in majority-Black schools ended the year six months behind where they would have been in both reading and math; students in white-majority schools lost four months of math and three months of reading.</p>



<p>It’s impossible to say to what extent school closures and shifts to virtual learning played in these lower-than-expected test scores. “Right now, we don’t have the evidence to conclude whether the impacts we are seeing are because students were learning remotely, or because there was a global pandemic happening,” Pier says. Kids could have also been struggling with losing a parent, caring for siblings or internet connection problems. Without all the information about kids’ lives, including their school experiences, she says, “we can’t answer the questions we want.”</p>



<h3>Virtual, for some</h3>



<p>One big question is how virtual school stacks up against in-person school. In the fall of 2020, the CDC’s Ethier and her colleagues asked 1,290 parents of 5- to 12-year-olds about the type of schooling available to their child, along with questions about the well-being of the family.</p>



<p>On 11 of 17 measures, families with kids who were doing partial or full-time virtual school <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/70/wr/mm7011a1.htm">were doing worse</a> than those who attended full-time in person. Kids in virtual school were getting less exercise, less time in person with friends and less time outside. Parents of kids in virtual school were worse off, too, reporting mental distress, difficulty sleeping and conflicts between work and childcare. “Both in terms of stress that families feel, and outcomes among children, there really were significant differences” between in-person and virtual learning, Ethier says.</p>



<p>Ethier’s study, published March 19 in <em>Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report</em>, “gives us some clues about who to watch out for and what to watch out for,” she says.</p>



<p>Families of color were more likely to have a student in virtual school than white families, Ethier’s team found. A recent study of New York schools revealed similar trends. Across the state, about <a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2781960">18 percent of elementary students had access to in-person school</a>. But a racial breakdown turned up stark differences in who could go to school and who had to stay home. About 30 percent of white students could attend in-person school; for Black students, that number was only 5 percent, Ashley Fox and her colleagues report July 15 in <em>JAMA Network Open</em>.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" width="680" height="453" src="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/080321_ls_covid-school-kids_inline2.jpg" alt="group of young children sitting on the floor, spread out and wearing masks" class="wp-image-3102353" srcset="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/080321_ls_covid-school-kids_inline2.jpg 680w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/080321_ls_covid-school-kids_inline2-575x383.jpg 575w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/080321_ls_covid-school-kids_inline2-675x450.jpg 675w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/080321_ls_covid-school-kids_inline2-279x186.jpg 279w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><figcaption><span class="caption wp-caption-3102353">In-person schooling was more likely to be offered by schools that served predominantly white, advantaged, suburban or rural areas, a study of New York state elementary schools found.</span><span class="credit wp-credit-3102353">Mary Altaffer/AP Photo</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>More advantaged students, such as white, suburban middle-class kids, had considerably more access to in-person school than other groups. Those other groups included students from urban areas, low-income families, students with disabilities and students experiencing homelessness, Fox, a health policy researcher at University at Albany in New York, and her team found. &nbsp;</p>



<p>Even before the pandemic, schools had massive inequities; depending on where students live, they received different educational experiences. Fox’s new tally of which schools stayed open shows that the pandemic exacerbated these inequities. A caveat, Fox says, is that the researchers measured access to in-person school, not whether a family actually chose that option.</p>



<h3>An emotional toll</h3>



<p>These academic inequities are not surprising, says Noguera. “The real issue now is what we do about it.” It would be a mistake, he says, “to focus narrowly on academics and ignore some of the mental health challenges that kids will be bringing back with them.”</p>



<p>Depression and anxiety rates among children and adolescents are rising. More kids with <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/69/wr/mm6945a3.htm#F1_down">mental health crises</a> are turning up in emergency departments, scientists described in <em>Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report</em> November 13. Compared with April through December of 2019, the proportion of children ages 5 to 11 who had mental health-related visits in the same months of 2020 increased by about 25 percent on average, from 782 mental-health-related visits per 100,000 total visits in 2019 to 972 such visits in 2020. &nbsp;For adolescents ages 12 to 17, that proportion increased by about 30 percent, from 3,098 mental-health visits per 100,000 total visits in 2019 to 4,051 in 2020.</p>

<p>And in February and March of this year, there were an average of 855 emergency department visits a week for suspected suicide attempts among 12- to 17-year-old girls, an <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/70/wr/mm7024e1.htm?s_cid=mm7024e1_x">increase of about 50 percent</a> over with the same winter weeks of 2019, scientists reported June 18 in <em>Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report</em>.</p>



<p>These studies weren’t designed to pinpoint causes of this increasing emotional distress. But hints come from surveys of families, such as Ethier’s. Parents of children who received virtual school were more likely to report their kids had worse mental or emotional health compared with parents of children who attended in-person school.</p>



<p>Interrupted schooling may cast long shadows, says Dimitri Christakis of Seattle Children’s Research Institute. Earlier studies have linked educational attainment with people’s future health, earnings potential and even how long they live. Losing out on school is a big deal, says Christakis. “Children’s lives, their longevity, their health, will be impacted,” he says, “not in the short term, necessarily, but over their life-span.”</p>



<p>As students come back into their classrooms, teachers, administrators and parents would do well to acknowledge all the burdens kids are carrying into class, and not just the academic ones. “We should be thinking of the restart, the return to school, as an opportunity to do things differently,” Noguera says. “To not just to go back to the way it was, but to really try to make schools much more responsive to the needs of kids and parents than they have been.”</p>
