              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/honeybee-mental-number-line-order-left-right">Honeybees order numbers from left to right, a study claims</a></h4>

              
                <p>Like many humans, honeybees seem to prefer their numbers ordered from left to right.</p>



<p>Honeybees trained to recognize a specific number tend to fly left when given two side-by-side options of a smaller number and right when the options represent a larger number, a new study claims. The finding suggests that <a href="https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2203584119" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">honeybees have a “mental number line”</a> and that this association has biological roots, researchers report October 17 in the <em>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences</em>.</p>





<p>While some scientists agree that the study makes a compelling case for a mental number line in honeybees, others argue that the new work is an oversimplification of complex human behavior.</p>



<p>Many humans have a mental number line that often puts smaller numbers on the left and bigger numbers on the right — if asked to organize several bunches of grapes by size, you’d likely line them up by increasing number of grapes from left to right. Whether this association is present at birth or learned later in life has long been a subject of debate.</p>



<p>Previous work has shown that <a href="https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rstb.2016.0513" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">honeybees can count</a>, and that they even understand <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/bees-join-exclusive-crew-animals-get-concept-zero" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the concept of zero</a> (<em>SN: 6/7/18</em>). “When you realize all these facts, an obvious question [is whether honeybees have] the so-called mental number line,” says Martin Giurfa, a biologist at the Université Paul Sabatier in Toulouse, France. Working from home during COVID-19 lockdowns, Giurfa tested 134 honeybees (<em>Apis mellifera</em>) on their number-ordering abilities using a design developed with researchers who had done <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/chicks-show-left-right-number-bias" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">similar experiments with chicks</a> and <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/desc.12801" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">human babies</a> (<em>SN: 1/29/15</em>).</p>



<p>First, Giurfa had to teach his bee pupils to recognize numbers. Using sugar water, he lured honeybees into a testing chamber built from a repurposed wine box. For each bee, he hung a panel on the back of the box with a certain number of symbols on it — one, three or five — and fed them the sugar water so they’d learn to associate the number with food. By varying what the symbols looked like between visits, he ensured the bees were learning the number itself and not certain shapes or arrangements.</p>



<p>After 30 trips to the box, it was time for a test: Giurfa removed the training panel and set up two, mirror-image panels, one on the left wall of the box and one on the right. These new panels either had the same number of symbols as the training panel, fewer symbols or more.</p>



<p>Which panel did the bees fly to — left or right? “It depends on your reference number,” Giurfa says. Of the bees trained on “one,” 72 percent flew to the “three” panel to the right, but of the bees trained on “five,” 73 percent went to the “three” panel to the left. “That’s exactly the concept of the mental number line,” Giurfa says. “You align numbers based on your reference.” If the test number was the same as the training number, the bees showed no preference for left or right.</p>



<p>These experiments “make a very compelling case” for a mental number line in honeybees, says Felicity Muth, a biologist at the University of Texas at Austin who was not involved with the study. “They have a number of controls that really rule out any of the alternative explanations I can think of.”</p>



<p>Giurfa believes these results show that mental number lines, or at least some component of them, are present across the animal kingdom. However, not everyone is convinced.</p>



<p>&#8220;The oversimplification of complex human concepts, such as that of ‘number line,’ must be avoided, since they severely distort the reality of the phenomena that make them possible,” says Rafael Núñez, a cognitive scientist at the University of California, San Diego.</p>



<p>Núñez, who coauthored <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/cogs.12296" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">an article critical of the earlier chick study</a>, thinks animal research should address why bees and chicks would have inborn mental number lines while some human groups, like <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0035662" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">those he’s studied in Papua New Guinea</a>, don’t. Giurfa acknowledges that culture plays a role in explaining why <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/psychology-number-line-space-map-different-directions" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">not every adult naturally orders numbers from left to right</a>, but feels that the proof is there for a biological underpinning (<em>SN: 8/23/21</em>). &nbsp;</p>



<p>This study stops short of explaining why the brains of bees, chicks and babies have all converged on the same left-to-right number ordering but does offer a possible answer — their asymmetrical brains. All three have brains that process information differently on the left and right sides. “It might be an inherent property to these lateralized brain systems,” Giurfa says.</p>



<p>A shared system for organizing numbers, if truly widespread, would highlight how surprisingly similar animal minds can be to our own. Though some cognitive powers seem to be uniquely human, Giurfa thinks there is danger in dismissing the abilities of animals. “We are different from animals in some aspects,” he says, “but we are very similar in others. Denying this similarity is not what will help us understand what we are.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/seabirds-typhoons-shearwaters-survival">Some seabirds survive typhoons by flying into them</a></h4>

              
                <p>Some seabirds don’t just survive storms. They ride them.</p>



<p>Streaked shearwaters nesting on islands off Japan <a href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2212925119" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">sometimes head straight toward passing typhoons</a>, where they fly near the eye of the storm for hours at a time, researchers report in the Oct. 11 <em>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences</em>. This strange behavior — not reported in any other bird species — might help streaked shearwaters (<em>Calonectris leucomelas</em>) survive strong storms.</p>



<p>Birds and other animals living in areas with hurricanes and typhoons have adopted <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/blog/wild-things/what-happens-animals-hurricane" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">strategies to weather these deadly storms</a> (<em>SN: 10/2/15</em>). &nbsp;In recent years, a few studies using GPS trackers have revealed that some ocean-dwelling birds — such as the frigatebird (<em>Fregata minor</em>) — will take <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-019-41481-x" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">massive detours to avoid cyclones</a>.</p>





<p>This is an understandable strategy for birds that spend most of their time at sea where “there is literally nowhere to hide,” says Emily Shepard, a behavior ecologist at Swansea University in Wales. To find out whether shearwaters also avoid storms, she and her colleagues used 11 years of tracking data from GPS locators attached to the wings of 75 birds nesting on Awashima Island in Japan.</p>



<p>By combining this information with data on wind speeds during typhoons, the researchers discovered that shearwaters that were caught out in the open ocean when a storm blew in would ride tailwinds around the edges of the storm. However, others that found themselves sandwiched between land and the eye of a strong cyclone would sometimes veer off their usual flight patterns and head toward the center of the storm.</p>

<h3>Flight path</h3>



<p>As Typhoon Cimaron moved across the Sea of Japan (black track) in August 2018, GPS trackers monitored the movements of 32 streaked shearwaters (<em>Calonectris leucomelas</em>) just off the coast of Japan. The tracking data show three birds (seen here in red and teal) flew toward the eye of the storm through some of the highest winds. Two other birds (light green) began heading toward the eye as the storm swept past.</p>

<p>Of the 75 monitored shearwaters, 13 flew to within 60 kilometers of the eye — an area Shepherd calls the “eye socket,” where the winds were strongest — for up to eight hours, tracking the cyclone as it headed northward. “It was one of those moments where we couldn’t believe what we were seeing,” Shepard says. “We had a few predictions for how they might behave, but this was not one of them.”</p>



<p>The shearwaters were more likely to head for the eye during stronger storms, soaring on winds as swift as 75 kilometers per hour. This suggest that the birds might be following the eye to avoid being blown inland, where they risk crashing onto land or being hit by flying debris, Shepard says.</p>



<p>While this is the first time this behavior has been spotted in any bird species, flying with the winds could be a common tactic for preserving energy during cyclones, says Andrew Farnsworth, an ornithologist at Cornell University who was not involved in the study. “It might seem counterintuitive,” he says. “But from the perspective of bird behavior, it makes a lot of sense.”</p>

                <p>Fall and winter have not been kind to us over the last couple of years.</p>



<p>In 2020, cases of COVID-19 began to climb in October. And at this time last year, we were in the calm before the storm, so to speak, with delta-driven case counts slowly dipping before <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/omicron-coronavirus-variant-vaccines-mutations">the omicron variant began its road to global domination</a> at the end of November (<em>SN: 12/1/21</em>). What will happen in our third pandemic winter, as omicron continues to evolve and many people ditch their masks?&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>





<p>Only time will tell. But already there are some warning signs that we could be faced with yet another wave of infections, hospitalizations and deaths. For one, cases and hospitalizations are <a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2022/10/07/1127017062/early-signs-a-new-u-s-covid-surge-could-be-on-its-way" target="_blank" rel="noopener">increasing in some European countries</a>, including the United Kingdom.</p>



<p>What happens across the pond usually portends what will happen in the United States. At the national level and in most states, cases are still going down. But experts worry that may not hold true for long, as temperatures drop and more people gather indoors where the coronavirus is more likely to spread. Some Northeastern states, for instance, have seen a sharp increase in coronavirus levels in wastewater, suggesting there has been an uptick in transmission even if it’s <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/covid-coronavirus-rapid-test-at-home-positive-cases">not yet reflected in official case counts</a> (<em>SN: 4/22/22</em>).</p>



<p>There’s also a wild card this year, complicating matters. New versions of omicron abound. How might they shift the pandemic’s near future?&nbsp;</p>



<p>It’s a hard question to answer. On one hand, we’re in a very different place than we were two years ago, or even last year, with more <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/covid-coronavirus-drugs-treatments-latest-news">treatments on hand</a> and an <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/omicron-booster-shot-vaccine-covid-coronavirus-pfizer-moderna">omicron-specific booster</a> (<em>SN: 5/11/22; SN: 9/2/22).</em> But the coronavirus has been known to throw us a few curveballs. Experts expect that winter will usher in yet another wave, but what it will look like and how high it will crest is unclear.</p>



<p>“Although we can feel good that we are going in the right direction, we can’t let our guard down,” said National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases director Anthony Fauci at an <a href="https://centerforhealthjournalism.org/content/covid-monkeypox-conversation-dr-anthony-fauci" target="_blank" rel="noopener">October 4 webinar</a> held by the University of Southern California Annenberg Center for Health Journalism in Los Angeles.</p>



<p>There is some good(ish) news: Most people have been exposed to the virus, whether through vaccination or — the less-desirable route — an infection, or both. That means our immune systems have the virus’s mug shot on hand. Our antibodies and T cells are trained to kick into high gear if the coronavirus trips any alarm bells as it enters our noses, throats or lungs.&nbsp;</p>

<p>These immune barriers can dampen the virus’s ability to spread among people, as well as protect many from becoming seriously ill. As a result, fewer people may end up in the hospital or dying compared with previous years.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But then there’s the bad news: Over the last year, the omicron variant has adopted a few disguises in the form of mutations that help the virus hide from our immune systems. Over the summer, a version called BA.5 rose to dominance, pushing out its relatives BA.2 and BA.2.12.1. Now, researchers are keeping tabs on a new alphanumeric motley crew of omicron versions.</p>



<p>It is possible that a new worrisome variant could suddenly appear and outcompete all its relatives, as the delta and omicron variants did in 2021. The next name on the list would be “pi.”</p>



<p>But another — perhaps more likely — possibility is that over the next few months, our attention won’t be focused on a single lineage that sweeps the world but on a swarm of new variants. That’s thanks in part to the arms race between our immune systems and the virus.</p>



<p>Now that so many people have some kind of protection, compared with in 2020 or early 2021, the coronavirus must constantly change in ways that poke holes in those defenses in order to spread. Some variants circulating now have independently <a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.09.15.507787v3" target="_blank" rel="noopener">acquired the same mutations,</a> imparting similar abilities to dodge antibodies in lab tests, researchers report in a preliminary study posted October 4 at bioRxiv.org. With multiple variants using the same tactics to get around people’s immune systems, it can be tough for a single variant to come out on top.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Two of the newest omicron versions, BQ.1.1 and BA.2.75.2, are <a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.09.15.507787v3" target="_blank" rel="noopener">particularly adept at dodging some individual antibodies</a> taken from people who had recovered from a BA.2 or BA.5 infection, the researchers found. That means some people may be more susceptible to another infection if the new versions, which are <a href="https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#variant-proportions" target="_blank" rel="noopener">so far present at low levels in the United States</a>, spread widely this fall.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Officials have already taken some steps to tackle this ever-changing virus. This fall, Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna released tweaked versions of their mRNA vaccines that tackle both the original version of the coronavirus and omicron to give immune systems a refresher course. But few of these updated shots are making it into arms. Half of U.S. adults say they have heard <a href="https://www.kff.org/coronavirus-covid-19/poll-finding/kff-covid-19-vaccine-monitor-september-2022/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">little to nothing</a> about COVID-19 boosters, according to a Kaiser Family Foundation poll released September 30. And so far, only around <a href="https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#vaccinations_vacc-people-additional-dose-totalpop" target="_blank" rel="noopener">4 percent of people</a> age 12 or older have gotten the new jabs. (On October 12, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention <a href="https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/coronavirus-covid-19-update-fda-authorizes-moderna-and-pfizer-biontech-bivalent-covid-19-vaccines" target="_blank" rel="noopener">signed off on</a> <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/media/releases/2022/s1012-COVID-19-Vaccines.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">bivalent boosters</a> for 5- to 11-year-olds.)</p>



<p>What’s more, omicron’s continued evolution means that vulnerable people are fast losing COVID-19 treatment options. The October 4 study, which has not yet been peer-reviewed, also found that the last stronghold of antibody drugs that are used to treat or protect high-risk patients — therapies called bebtelovimab and Evusheld — didn’t recognize some of the new variants when tested in lab dishes. And on October 3, the FDA warned that Evusheld, which is used as a preexposure treatment to protect immunocompromised people, <a href="https://www.fda.gov/drugs/drug-safety-and-availability/fda-releases-important-information-about-risk-covid-19-due-certain-variants-not-neutralized-evusheld" target="_blank" rel="noopener">doesn’t work for all variants</a>. The drug still offers protection against many of the currently circulating variants, the FDA said, as does the antiviral Paxlovid. &nbsp;</p>



<p>Another unknown that we’re facing this winter is how much other respiratory infections might add on to an already COVID-heavy burden. Flu season in Australia, usually a bellwether for those of us north of the equator, was back after a two-year hiatus and got an earlier than usual start. Experts are once again <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/covid19-coronavirus-flu-season-fall">warning about a possible “twindemic”</a> in the Northern Hemisphere, with both influenza and the coronavirus making people ill (<em>SN: 9/18/20</em>). Not to mention, there are myriad other infections that most people haven’t been exposed to over the last couple of years thanks to masking and social distancing.</p>



<p>That’s not to say everyone needs to prepare for yet another lonely winter. But it’s a sobering reminder that taking extra precautions such as testing before social gatherings and masking — especially around vulnerable people — would be wise, even as we get on with our lives. And that reminds me: I need to order more masks.</p>

                <p>In a step towards development of robots that interact meaningfully with humans, a new study from Katie Riddoch of the University of Glasgow, Scotland, and colleagues shares insights on specific dog behaviors that dog owners perceive as important for bonding with their pets.

<p>Robots with social behaviors have been proposed as a potential solution to ease people&rsquo;s loneliness and the challenges of aging. Given the difficulty of creating robots that behave like humans, and the known benefits of the bond between owners and their dogs, some researchers are exploring the possibility of developing dog-inspired robots that can form similar bonds with humans. However, this endeavor requires a deeper understanding of specific dog behaviors that facilitate human-dog bonds.</p>



<h3><strong>Study Design and Findings</strong></h3>



<p>To gain deeper insight into human&mdash;dog bonds, Riddoch and colleagues conducted a survey study of 153 dog owners. They asked the participants open-ended questions about which dog behaviors they felt were especially important in establishing and maintaining their bond with their dog.</p>



<p>Owners described a wide range of key behaviors, such as nudging the owner with a paw or looking back at the owner on walks, which appeared to facilitate such perceptions as the dog being protective or checking in with the owner. In analyzing the responses, the researchers identified 7 core categories of behaviors that owners felt were important: attunement, communication, consistency and predictability, physical affection, positivity and enthusiasm, proximity, and shared activities.</p>

<h3><strong>Future Research</strong></h3>



<p>Meanwhile, other research could further investigate the dog&mdash;human bond, such as by exploring variations in preferences for dog behaviors among people with different backgrounds and demographics.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-left">The authors add: &ldquo;Using a qualitative approach enabled us to gain a deep and nuanced understanding of the things people find so endearing about our canine companions.

<p><strong>Oil on the waters </strong>— <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/oil-waters-modest-progress-cleanup-technology"><em>Science News</em></a>, October 14, 1972</p>



<p>[In the late 1960s], about the best means of cleaning up oil was to put straw on it, then scoop up the oily straw by hand or with pitchforks. Now industry … has devised an arsenal of oil cleanup chemicals. Thin-layer chemicals can be used to herd oil together and to thicken it…. Chemicals are available as absorbents too. Still other chemicals … disperse oil throughout the water. Other chemicals show promise as oil-burning agents.</p>





<h4>Update</h4>



<p>Chemicals are the norm today, but the future of oil-cleanup technology may well be microbial. In recent years, researchers have shown that soil microbes broke down some of the oil from the 2010 <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/oil-munching-microbes-cleaning-gulf-marshes-faster-expected">Deepwater Horizon spill</a> in the Gulf of Mexico (<em>SN Online: 6/26/15</em>). And electrical bacteria, which channel electricity through their threadlike bodies, could help by <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/electrical-bacteria-may-help-clean-oil-spills-and-curb-methane-emissions">turning oil munchers’ waste into fuel for the microbes</a>, scientists reported (<em>SN: 7/16/22&nbsp;&amp; 7/30/22, p.&nbsp;24</em>). Microbial mops aren’t yet ready for prime time, so chemical dispersants, fire and spongelike sorbents remain key tools in cleanup kits.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/cats-eye-nebula-3d-model-rings-jets">A 3-D model of the Cat’s Eye nebula shows rings sculpted by jets</a></h4>

              
                <p>Roughly 3,000 light-years from Earth sits one of the most complex and least understood nebulae, a whirling landscape of gas and dust left in the wake of a star’s death throes. A new computer visualization reveals the 3-D structure of the Cat’s Eye nebula and hints at how not one, but a pair of dying stars sculpted its complexity.</p>



<p>The digital reconstruction, based on images from the Hubble Space Telescope, reveals two symmetric rings around the nebula’s edges. The rings were probably formed by <a href="https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article/516/2/2711/6696946" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a spinning jet of charged gas that was launched from two stars</a> in the nebula’s center, Ryan Clairmont and colleagues report in the October <em>Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society</em><em>.</em></p>





<p>“I realized there hasn’t been a comprehensive study of the structure of the nebula since the early ’90s,” says Clairmont, an undergraduate at Stanford University. Last year, while a high school student in San Diego, he reached out to a couple of astrophysicists at a scientific imaging company called Ilumbra who had written software to reconstruct the 3-D structure of astronomical objects.</p>



<p>The team combined Hubble images with ground-based observations of light in several wavelengths, which revealed the motions of the nebula’s gas. Figuring out which parts were moving toward and away from Earth helped reveal its 3-D structure.</p>



<p>The team identified two partial rings to either side of the nebula’s center. The rings’ symmetry and unfinished nature suggest they are the remains of a plasma jet launched from the heart of the nebula, then snuffed out before it could complete a full circle. Such jets are usually formed through an interaction between two stars orbiting one another, says Ilumbra partner Wolfgang Steffen, who is based in Kaiserslautern, Germany.</p>



<p>The work <a href="https://projectboard.world/isef/finalist-booth/phys038---evolution-of-the-cats-eye-nebula" target="_blank" rel="noopener">won Clairmont a prize at the 2021 International Science and Engineering Fair</a>, an annual competition run by the Society for Science, which publishes <em>Science News</em>. Steffen was skeptical about the tight deadline — when Clairmont reached out, he had just two months to complete the project.</p>



<p>“I said that’s impossible! Not even Ph.D. students or anybody has tried that before,” Steffen says. “He did it brilliantly. He pulled it all off and more than we expected.”</p>

<h2><strong>Retraction specific questions:</strong></h2>



<p><strong>Q: Is a retraction still seen in the academic community as a potentially career-ending/negative event for an author? Is this view changing?</strong></p>

          <p><b>A: Renee Hoch, Managing Editor of the PLOS Publication Ethics Team:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> This is indeed still an issue, possibly in some countries more than others. We hope that the general view will change, and that those in positions to decide on sanctions, promotions, tenure decisions, and funding will consider case details rather than take a blanket view on retractions. Not all retractions are the same. There are cases of blatant and purposeful academic misconduct, which should have a negative effect on the perpetrator&rsquo;s career, but even in these cases there may be co-authors who were uninvolved in and unaware of the misconduct. There are also cases that stem from misunderstandings about authorship or data ownership, reporting errors and data unavailability, or honest errors. In some of these cases, a retraction may be an indicator of a training gap. Punishing retractions uniformly, without considering context, may not get to the root of the issue, helps to perpetuate stigma around retractions, and may deter researchers from stepping forward when they become aware of major concerns. Authors who proactively reach out to request retraction when they discover an error with their paper should be applauded rather than punished. </span><b>Is this view changing? </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Institutional and funding body representatives would be better placed than publishers to answer this, although publishers can do their part by providing clear information in retraction notices as to the reasons for retraction, and by notifying the relevant parties in cases where an institutional investigation may be warranted. </span></p>

<p><strong>Q: Do you think questions/concerns raised on places like pubpeer should be anonymous and without any accompanying declaration of Conflicts of Interests?</strong></p>



<p><strong>A: Renee Hoch:</strong>&nbsp; It is helpful to give readers the option of listing their name or posting anonymously according to their personal preference. Anonymity can help readers to express concerns without fear of reprisal, particularly in cases where one raises concerns about work by a colleague, collaborator, or researcher who may contribute to one&rsquo;s own career (e.g. via grant review). On the other hand, if a reader is comfortable providing their name &ndash; whether on a public site such as Pubpeer or in a personal communication to the journal/publisher &ndash; then they can obtain public credit for their observations (if they self-identify publicly), and the journal/publisher can follow up with them directly to ask for any clarifications and provide an update when the case is resolved. I am a proponent of transparently declaring potential conflicts of interest, but I appreciate that in some cases these interests may be identifying. At PLOS, we follow up on concerns about our content whether or not the person raising them has potential conflicts. Importantly, we focus our investigations on the issues, article content, and evidence (e.g. primary data), not on the person who raised the concerns.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Q: How much evidence do journals need to raise questions about scientific integrity of data?&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></p>



<p><strong>A: Renee Hoch: </strong>We investigate every claim that calls into question the integrity of any paper we publish, but we need readers to provide specific details as to the nature of the concerns and which results are in question. In cases involving data integrity concerns, if a reader has already done an analysis or made an observation that supports their concerns, then providing details of the analysis and/or findings can greatly aid in our assessment.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>Journal-specific questions:</strong></h2>



<p><strong>Q: Is there a time limitation post publication to file a grievance with a Journal?</strong></p>



<p><strong>A:Renee Hoch:</strong> <strong>&nbsp;</strong>No. However, some universities and research institutions have time limits as to when they will investigate concerns, and this can present a barrier to journal-level work in some cases.</p>



<p><strong>Q: Why do journals refuse the self-citation and consider it as plagiarism?</strong>&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>A: Renee Hoch:</strong> We do not refuse self-citation, i.e. citation of one&rsquo;s previous works. However, re-using previously published content without citing the original source is misleading and in some cases may present copyright concerns. Also, authors should not preferentially cite their own works over others, rather they should discuss the relevant literature in a balanced manner that accurately represents the current state of the field, giving due attribution to all key contributors.</p>



<p><strong>Q: Why not publish in an Appendix anonymized reviewer comments and author responses?</strong></p>



<p><strong>A: Renee Hoch:</strong> While the standard in the field has historically been to hold peer review as confidential, some publishers and other stakeholders have recently taken steps toward opening up peer review and providing transparency as to the article assessment process. Since 2019, PLOS has offered authors the option of publishing peer review history (review reports and decision letters) alongside accepted research articles. We use a separate tab on article pages for peer review history rather than an Appendix. This allows interested readers to navigate easily through the various documents. While we encourage this transparency with regard to article assessment, it is not mandatory. For additional discussion of transparent peer review, see <a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2018/08/transparency-credit-and-peer-review/">here</a> and<a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2020/06/published-peer-review-1-year-across-plos/"> here</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Q: Why not routinely provide the public with the possibility of evaluating scientific conclusions through links to the evidence on which conclusions are based?</strong></p>



<p><strong>A: Renee Hoch, Managing Editor of the PLOS Publication Ethics Team:</strong> This is one of the primary objectives of the open data movement which has made great strides over the past decade. PLOS has a Data Availability policy, which was updated in 2014 to require that authors make publicly available the minimal dataset underlying an article&rsquo;s findings.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Q: Do you think the timeliness concerns are related to the workforce crisis in peer review?</strong></p>



<p><strong>A: Renee Hoch, Managing Editor of the PLOS Publication Ethics Team:</strong>&nbsp; I am answering this under the assumption that &lsquo;timeliness concerns&rsquo; refer to concerns about the timeliness of research publication, i.e. the time required for submissions to undergo peer review process. There are several factors that contribute to this, including difficulties securing peer reviewers who are suitable, willing, and available to contribute to the process. This could be improved by having increasingly effective tools to help editors find suitable reviewers, and by having peer review contributions formally recognized or even required by tenure and promotion committees and hiring managers. Reviewers for PLOS have the option of linking peer review contributions via their ORCID profiles in cases where they are willing to self-identify as reviewers.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Q: What are some ways to encourage the inclusion of a Limitations section in every paper?</strong></p>



<p><strong>A:Renee Hoch, Managing Editor of the PLOS Publication Ethics Team:</strong> This could be encouraged through training and reinforcement. Institutions and established investigators could provide (or even require) research reporting training for early career researchers, and one aspect of this training could be to emphasize the importance of discussing limitations as a standard section within each research article. This training can then be reinforced through peer review: as part of their evaluation, reviewers and handling editors should consider whether a manuscript adequately addresses a study&rsquo;s limitations and assumptions, and request revisions to add or improve upon this where needed. If researchers themselves have been trained to recognize the importance of this section, they will look for it in the articles they evaluate as reviewers. Journals could also include a section on Limitations in their submission guidelines, but ultimately it will be the handling editors and reviewers who evaluate the scientific content of each submission and provide feedback on this type of reporting issue.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Q: Do you feel that there needs to be more of an effort to educate/reinforce an understanding of the process of peer review to increase trust in results?</strong></p>



<p><strong>A: Renee Hoch, Managing Editor of the PLOS Publication Ethics Team:</strong>&nbsp; To increase trust in results, it may be more effective to focus resources on (a) improving adoption of open data practices, (b) emphasizing the importance of critically evaluating primary research literature, (c) encouraging reproducibility efforts and publication of both confirmatory and contradictory results, and (d) ensuring that news articles and other public discussions accurately summarize the findings without over-hyping or overstating the study&rsquo;s results. Increasing awareness and understanding of peer review &ndash; including its strengths and limitations &ndash; may help by informing how the general audience approaches research reports. For example, this may help readers better appreciate the difference between peer-reviewed work that has been vetted by experts in the field and non-peer-reviewed articles (including pre-prints) that may not have been critically assessed before posting/publication.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>Questions related to news and promotion:</strong></h2>



<p><strong>Q: Do you think that journal press offices should proactively flag their (high-profile) retractions to journalists as well to ensure trust in science?</strong></p>

          <p><b>A: Dave Knutson, Sr. Manager, Communications: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yes, but with a caveat: Only if the journal publicized the paper when it was originally published. They have a responsibility to correct the public record. However, for journals like </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">PLOS ONE</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, publicly calling out every retraction would end up being white noise to the public. </span></p>
        </div>
      </div>
    


<p><strong>Q: On what basis do journalists decide what topics to cover or publicize?</strong></p>



<p><strong>A: Dave Knutson::</strong> This may not seem satisfying, but it&rsquo;s years of honing one&rsquo;s news judgment. Journalists are constantly asking themselves: What does my audience need to know? And that question differs for every outlet. A reporter for the LA Times will answer that question differently than a journalist affiliated with the BBC. That said, here are some other considerations: Timeliness (is it happening now?), Progress (is it new?), Emotion (is there a human element?), Consequence (how many people will it affect/impact?), Proximity (is this a local story?), Conflict (are there differing opinions?) and is it unusual.</p>



<p><strong>Q: What do you think about the role that university press offices play in disseminating hyped up science?</strong></p>

        <div class="block-image-text__text">
          <p><b>A: Beth Baker, Sr. Media Relations Manager</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: Press officers have a key role in communicating science accurately. Research (for example, </span><a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0168217"><span style="font-weight: 400;">this study</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">) suggests that when press releases contain &ldquo;hyping&rdquo; language &ndash; unwarranted casual claims, explicit health advice, and so on &ndash; subsequent news coverage is more likely also to contain these exaggerations. Meanwhile, inclusion of appropriate caveats and limitations in press releases is linked with their increased inclusion in news coverage. Since the more cautious, accurate press releases are not associated with reduced news coverage, there&rsquo;s no reason for press officers not to communicate with measured language and messages that we&rsquo;re confident will stand up to scrutiny &ndash; and that&rsquo;s certainly our aim at PLOS. Although university press officers in particular are under increasing pressure to &ldquo;market&rdquo; their institution and its research, I&rsquo;ve also found all those I work with to be dedicated to prioritizing communication that accurately reflects the science &ndash; which is as it should be.</span></p>
        </div>
      </div>
    


<p><strong>Q: Is there a difference between promoting preprints and promoting unpublished research presented at e.g. conferences?</strong>&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>A: Beth Baker, Sr. Media Relations Manager: </strong>Preprints and conference presentations are similar in that both may include research which has not (yet!) been peer-reviewed. Both are intended for an audience of researchers &ndash; for example, to share results early with colleagues &ndash; who are well-qualified to evaluate the science. At PLOS, we recommend against active promotion of either type of unpublished research, instead advising that authors and press officers wait until after peer review. The main difference between preprints and conference presentations in this respect is a practical one: while only conference attendees will see presentations, preprint servers are generally open to everyone, making it more likely that journalists will reach out to authors. We always recommend that if researchers choose to engage with such requests, they stress that their work is still undergoing peer review &ndash; and may be subject to change as a result.</p>



<h2><strong>Random questions:</strong></h2>



<p><strong>Q: How can journal editors ensure that studies conducted in low resource contexts do not have author teams excluding local scientists? This erodes local trust</strong>.</p>



<p><strong>A: Dave Knutson:</strong> We agree and last year announced this <a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2021/09/announcing-a-new-plos-policy-on-inclusion-in-global-research/">new policy </a>regarding inclusion in global research. You can also read this editorial in <em><a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosmedicine/article?id=10.1371/journal.pmed.1004099">PLOS Medicine</a></em>.</p>



<p><strong>Q: The effort to enhance access often doesn&rsquo;t get acknowledged or rewarded in the promotion/tenure process. Is that a barrier to the work you&rsquo;re trying to do?</strong></p>

          <p><b>A: Dan Morgan, Director of Communications and Community Relations: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">PLOS, and any publisher or organization committed to Open Science and Open Access would love to see Open publishing and research practices acknowledged and rewarded more. That would certainly be a key driver in an activity (scholarly communication) driven by acknowledgement and progress. However, we also believe authors choose Open practices as a matter of scientific integrity, and not just reward, especially when they are minor behavioral shifts with meaningful reputational and scientific benefits. If authors believe there is an Open Science practice that is discouraged, or an Open Science practice that is not worth the effort UNLESS it is rewarded, we would love to hear about it so we can shine a light on the best ways the Open Science community can help!</span></p>
        </div>
      </div>
    


<p><strong>Q: What are your thoughts on single-blinded review processes? How can we ensure high quality and non conflicting peer-reviews?</strong></p>



<p><strong>A: Renee Hoch, Managing Editor of the PLOS Publication Ethics Team: </strong>PLOS uses a single-anonymized peer review model in which reviewers know authors&rsquo; identities by default, but reviewer identities remain hidden. We also offer reviewers the opportunity to sign their reviews if they wish to do so (about 18% choose to sign across all submissions and journals).</p>



<p>We&rsquo;ve chosen a single-anonymized review as our default (over double-anonymized) for several reasons:</p>



<ul><li>Hiding author identities prevents the disclosure of COIs, and its effectiveness at limiting bias in peer review is questionable, since studies suggest reviewers can guess the identities of authors (or think they can)</li><li>Research suggests that, in cases where double-anonymized peer review is optional, reviewers are more critical of authors who choose to conceal their identities&ndash;introducing perhaps a new form of bias</li><li>Single-anonymized review with the option to sign allows reviewers to provide an honest critique without fear of retribution, while at the same time giving them the flexibility to share their identity when they feel comfortable doing so</li></ul>



<p>We do not necessarily see conflicting or contradictory reviews as a bad thing. Indeed, gathering insight from different perspectives is one of the great benefits of having more than one expert reviewer. Such discrepancies can indicate that something in the article is open to interpretation and requires clarification, or they may result from differences in the reviewers&rsquo; specific expertise. Identifying and understanding these issues is valuable to the assessment and selection process. We ask our editors to take any differences in reviewer feedback into account during decision-making, and to indicate which changes they agree with and would expect to see in a revision.</p>



<h2><strong>Closing:</strong></h2>



<p>We&rsquo;d like to thank all of our panelists for sharing their expertise with us. It was a rich discussion, which led to a lot of thought provoking questions. We hope this debate continues far beyond Peer Review Week. Watch this space for updates on our collaboration with other publishers with regards to these issues as well as updates to our own policies.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/ancient-worm-evolution-missing-link">This ancient worm might be an important evolutionary missing link</a></h4>

              
                <p>An ancient, armored worm may be the key to unraveling the evolutionary history of a diverse collection of marine invertebrates.</p>



<p>Discovered in China, a roughly 520-million-year-old fossil of the newly identified worm, dubbed <em>Wufengella</em>, might be the missing link between three of the phyla that constitute a cadre of sea creatures called lophophorates.</p>



<p>Based on a genetic analysis, <a href="https://www.cell.com/current-biology/fulltext/S0960-9822(22)01455-5" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Wufengella</em></a><a href="https://www.cell.com/current-biology/fulltext/S0960-9822(22)01455-5" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> is probably the common ancestor</a> that connects brachiopods, bryozoans and phoronid worms, paleontologist Jakob Vinther and colleagues report September 27 in <em>Current Biology</em>.</p>





<p>“We had been speculating that [the common ancestor] may have been some wormy animal that had plates on its back,” says Vinther, of the University of Bristol in England. “But we never had the animal.”</p>



<p>Roughly half a billion years ago, nearly all major animal groups burst onto the scene in a flurry of evolutionary diversification during what’s known as <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/iconic-fossils-some-worlds-top-cambrian-sites" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the Cambrian explosion</a> (<em>SN: 4/24/19</em>). During this time, lophophorates experienced a rapid growth of species, which has obscured the group’s evolutionary history.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" width="680" height="450" src="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/100722_ag_worm-fossil_inline1.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-3118298" srcset="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/100722_ag_worm-fossil_inline1.jpg 680w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/100722_ag_worm-fossil_inline1-579x383.jpg 579w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/100722_ag_worm-fossil_inline1-281x186.jpg 281w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><figcaption><span class="caption wp-caption-3118298">This <em>Wufengella</em> fossil, found in China, is roughly 520 million years old and sports several features common to sea creatures known as lophophorates.</span><span class="credit wp-credit-3118298">Jakob Vinther and Luke Parry</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>One thing that ties together the different phyla of the group is their tentacle-like feeding tubes known as lophophores. But beyond that commonality, the phyla are all quite different. Brachiopods are shelled animals that at first glance resemble clams. Bryozoans — commonly known as moss animals — are microscopic sedentary critters that live in corallike colonies. And phoronids, or horseshoe worms, are unsegmented, soft-bodied creatures that live in stationary, tubelike structures. (More recently, some researchers have determined that <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/blog/science-ticker/ancient-oddball-invertebrate-finds-its-place-tree-life" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">hyoliths</a> — an extinct animal known by their conical shells (<em>SN: 1/11/17</em>) — are also lophophorates because of the tentacled organ that surrounds their mouth.)</p>



<p><em>Wufengella</em> doesn’t belong to any of these phyla, Vinther and his colleagues found. But the critter has characteristics similar to those of brachiopods, horseshoe worms or bryozoans: a series of asymmetric, armored back plates, a wormlike body and bristles that stick out from lobes surrounding its body.</p>





<p>The fossil is a “great find,” says Gonzalo Giribet, an invertebrate zoologist at Harvard University who was not involved in the research. Still, the scientists’ analysis does not confirm that <em>Wufengella</em> is the long-sought missing link, he cautions, but rather suggests it.</p>



<p>Some researchers had hypothesized that lophophorates’ common ancestor would be a stationary creature that sat on the seafloor and fed only through tubes, similar to its modern kin. The <em>Wufengella</em> fossil could refute this idea; the animal’s body plan suggests instead that it crawled around, the researchers say.<a></a></p>



<p>A fossil like <em>Wufengella </em>had long been high on Vinther’s bucket list of fossils that he and his colleagues hoped to find. But “we always thought, ‘Well, we probably will never see that in real life,’” he says. Typically, such a creature would have spent its life in shallow water. Organisms don’t tend to preserve well there, decaying faster due to exposure to lots of oxygen. Vinther suggests that the <em>Wufengella</em> that his team found probably washed out to deep water in a storm.</p>



<p>Now that the researchers have found one <em>Wufengella</em>, they hope to find more, in part to see if there are other varieties. And perhaps the team could identify even more distant ancestors further back on the tree of life that might connect lophophorates with other animal groups such as mollusks, Vinther says, further fleshing out how life on Earth is connected.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/mesopotamia-city-marsh-islands-drone-lagash-iraq">Drone photos reveal an early Mesopotamian city made of marsh islands</a></h4>

              
                <p>A ground-penetrating eye in the sky has helped to rehydrate an ancient southern Mesopotamian city, tagging it as what amounted to a Venice of the Fertile Crescent. Identifying the watery nature of this early metropolis has important implications for how urban life flourished nearly 5,000 years ago between the Tigris and Euphrates rivers, where modern-day Iraq lies.</p>



<p>Remote-sensing data, mostly gathered by a specially equipped drone, indicate that a vast urban settlement called Lagash largely consisted of four marsh islands connected by waterways, says anthropological archaeologist Emily Hammer of the University of Pennsylvania. These findings add crucial details to an emerging view that <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jaa.2022.101458" target="_blank" rel="noopener">southern Mesopotamian cities did not, as traditionally thought, expand outward from temple</a> and administrative districts into irrigated farmlands that were encircled by a single city wall, Hammer reports in the December <em>Journal of Anthropological Archaeology</em>.</p>





<p>“There could have been multiple evolving ways for Lagash to be a city of marsh islands as human occupation and environmental change reshaped the landscape,” Hammer says.</p>



<p>Because Lagash had no geographical or ritual center, each city sector developed distinctive economic practices on an individual marsh island, much like the later Italian city of Venice, she suspects. For instance, waterways or canals crisscrossed one marsh island, where fishing and collection of reeds for construction may have predominated.</p>



<p>Two other Lagash marsh islands display evidence of having been bordered by gated walls that enclosed carefully laid out city streets and areas with large kilns, suggesting these sectors were built in stages and may have been the first to be settled. Crop growing and activities such as pottery making may have occurred there.</p>



<p>Drone photographs of what were probably harbors on each marsh island suggest that boat travel connected city sectors. Remains of what may have been footbridges appear in and adjacent to waterways between marsh islands, a possibility that further excavations can explore.</p>



<p>Lagash, which formed the core of one of the world’s earliest states, was founded between about 4,900 and 4,600 years ago. Residents abandoned the site, now known as Tell al-Hiba, around 3,600 years ago, past digs show. It was first excavated more than 40 years ago.</p>

<p>Previous analyses of the timing of ancient wetlands expansions in southern Iraq conducted by anthropological archaeologist Jennifer Pournelle of the University of South Carolina in Columbia indicated that Lagash and other southern Mesopotamian cities were built on raised mounds in marshes. Based on satellite images, archaeologist Elizabeth Stone of Stony Brook University in New York has proposed that Lagash consisted of around 33 marsh islands, many of them quite small.</p>



<p>Drone photos provided a more detailed look at Lagash’s buried structures than possible with satellite images, Hammer says. Guided by initial remote-sensing data gathered from ground level, a drone spent six weeks in 2019 taking high-resolution photographs of much of the site’s surface. Soil moisture and salt absorption from recent heavy rains helped the drone’s technology detect remnants of buildings, walls, streets, waterways and other city features buried near ground level.</p>



<p>Drone data enabled Hammer to narrow down densely inhabited parts of the ancient city to three islands, she says. A possibility exists that those islands were part of delta channels extending toward the Persian Gulf. A smaller, fourth island was dominated by a large temple.</p>



<p>Hammer’s drone probe of Lagash “confirms the idea of settled islands interconnected by watercourses,” says University of Chicago archaeologist Augusta McMahon, one of three co–field directors of ongoing excavations at the site.</p>



<p>Drone evidence of contrasting neighborhoods on different marsh islands, some looking planned and others more haphazardly arranged, reflect waves of immigration into Lagash between around 4,600 and 4,350 years ago, McMahon suggests. Excavated material indicates that new arrivals included residents of nearby and distant villages, mobile herders looking to settle down and slave laborers captured from neighboring city-states.</p>



<p>Dense clusters of residences and other buildings across much of Lagash suggest that tens of thousands of people lived there during its heyday, Hammer says. At that time, the city covered an estimated 4 to 6 square kilometers, nearly the area of Chicago.</p>



<p>It’s unclear whether <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/dawn-city">northern Mesopotamian cities from around 6,000 years</a> ago, which were not located in marshes, contained separate city sectors (<em>SN: 2/5/08</em>). But Lagash and other southern Mesopotamian cities likely exploited water transport and trade among closely spaced settlements, enabling unprecedented growth, says archaeologist Guillermo Algaze of the University of California, San Diego.</p>



<p>Lagash stands out as an early southern Mesopotamian city frozen in time, Hammer says. Nearby cities continued to be inhabited for a thousand years or more after Lagash’s abandonment, when the region had become less watery and sectors of longer-lasting cities had expanded and merged. At Lagash, “we have a rare opportunity to see what other ancient cities in the region looked like earlier in time,” Hammer says.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/dinosaur-mummies-fossils-paleontology">Dinosaur ‘mummies’ may not be rare flukes after all</a></h4>

              
                <p>It might be easier for dinosaurs to “mummify” than scientists thought.</p>



<p>Unhealed bite marks on fossilized dinosaur skin suggest that <a href="https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0275240" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the animal’s carcass was scavenged before being covered in sediment</a>, researchers report October 12 in <em>PLOS ONE</em>. The finding challenges the traditional view that burial very soon after death is required for dinosaur “mummies” to naturally form.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The new research centers on Dakota, an <em>Edmontosaurus</em> fossil unearthed in North Dakota in 1999. About 67 million years ago, Dakota was a roughly 12-meter-long, duck-billed dinosaur that ate plants. Today, Dakota’s fossilized limbs and tail still contain large areas of well-preserved, fossilized scaly skin, a striking example of dinosaur “mummification.”</p>





<p>The creature isn&#8217;t a true mummy because its skin has turned into rock, rather than being preserved as actual skin. Researchers have come to refer to such fossils with exquisitely preserved skin and other soft tissues as mummies.</p>



<p>In 2018, paleontologist Clint Boyd of the North Dakota Geological Survey in Bismarck and colleagues began a new phase of cleaning up and examining the dinosaur fossil. The team had found what looked like tears in the tail skin and puncture holes on the animal’s right front foot. To investigate what may have caused the skin marks, the researchers teamed up with Stephanie Drumheller, a paleontologist at the University of Tennessee in Knoxville, to remove extra rocky material around the marks.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The holes in the skin — particularly those on the front limb — are a close match for bite wounds from prehistoric relatives of modern-day crocodiles, the researchers say. “This is the first time that’s been seen in dinosaurian soft tissues,” Drumheller says.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Because the marks on the tail are larger than those on the front limb, the team thinks that at least two carnivores munched on the <em>Edmontosaurus</em> carcass, probably as scavengers because the wounds didn&#8217;t heal. But scavenging doesn’t fit into the traditional view of mummification.</p>



<p>“This assumption of rapid burial has been baked into the explanation for mummies for a while,” Drumheller says. That clearly wasn’t the case for Dakota. If scavengers had enough time to snack on its body, then the deceased dino had been out in the open for a while.</p>



<p>Observing Dakota’s deflated skin envelope, shrink-wrapped to the underlying bone with no muscle or other organs, Drumheller had an unexpected “eureka moment,” she says. “I had seen something like this before. It just wasn&#8217;t in the paleontological literature. It was in the forensics literature.”</p>



<p>When some smaller modern scavengers like raccoons feed on the internal organs of a larger carcass, the scavengers rip open the carcass’s body. The forensics research showed that this hole gives any gasses and fluids from further decomposition an escape route, allowing the remaining skin to dry out. Burial could happen afterward.</p>



<p>The researchers “make a very good point,” says Raymond Rogers, a researcher at Macalester College in Saint Paul, Minn., who studies how organisms decay and fossilize and wasn&#8217;t involved in the research. “It would be very unlikely for a carcass to achieve advanced stages of desiccation and also experience rapid burial. These two generally presumed prerequisites for mummification seem to be somewhat incompatible.”</p>



<p>Fossilization of soft tissues — like skin or <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/fossil-ancient-horseshoe-crab-brain" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">brains</a> or <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/fleshy-comb-first-found-dinosaur" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">fleshy head combs</a> — is uncommon, but not unheard of (<em>SN: 8/20/21</em>; <em>SN: 12/12/13</em>).&nbsp;“If [soft tissue] requires some spectacular confluence of weird events to get it fossilized at all, it&#8217;s far more common than then you would expect if that was the case,” Drumheller says. Perhaps, then, mummies originating from common carcass fates could explain this.</p>



<p>But while dry, “jerkylike” skin could survive long enough to be buried, the conditions involved aren’t necessarily common, says Evan Thomas Saitta, a paleontologist at the University of Chicago who was not involved with the study.</p>



<p>“I still suspect that this actual process is a very precise sequence of events, where if you get the timing wrong, you end up without a mummy dinosaur,” he says.</p>



<p>Understanding that sequence of events, and just how common it is, requires figuring out how fossilization proceeds after a mummy’s burial. This is an area of research that Boyd says he’s interested in looking into next.</p>



<p>“Is it just the same fossilization process as for the bones?” he asks. “Or do we also need a different set of geochemical conditions to then fossilize the skin?”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/human-nerve-cell-rat-brain-organoi">Clumps of human nerve cells thrived in rat brains</a></h4>

              
                <p>To coax human nerve cells in a laboratory to thrive, there are three magic words: location, location, location.</p>



<p>Many experiments grow human nerve cells in lab dishes. But a new study enlists some real estate that’s a bit more unconventional: the brain of a rat. Implanted clusters of human <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-022-05277-w" target="_blank" rel="noopener">neurons grow bigger and more complex</a> than their cohorts grown in dishes, researchers report online October 12 in <em>Nature</em>.</p>



<p>Not only that, but the human cells also appear functional, albeit in very limited ways. The implanted human cells can both receive signals from rat cells and influence the rats’ behavior, connections that “demonstrate more substantial integration of the transplanted neurons,” says Arnold Kriegstein, a developmental neuroscientist at the University of California, San Francisco, who wasn’t involved in the study. “This is a significant advance.”</p>





<p>Over the last decade, scientists have been building increasingly complex brain organoids, 3-D clusters of cells derived from stem cells that grow and <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/how-build-human-brain">mimic the human brain</a> (<em>SN: 2/20/18</em>). These organoids don’t re-create the full complexity of human neurons that develop in an actual brain. But they can be windows into an otherwise inscrutable process — human brain development, and how it can <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/brain-human-organoids-personalized-cluster-cells-study-disorders">go awry</a> (<em>SN: 9/3/21</em>). “Even if they’re not entirely perfect, [these models] are surrogates for human cells in a way that animal cells are not,” Kriegstein says. “And that’s really exciting.”</p>



<p>To push these cells closer to their full potential, Sergiu Pasca, a neuroscientist at the Stanford School of Medicine, and colleagues surgically implanted human cerebral organoids into the brains of newborn rat pups. Along with their hosts, the human organoids began to grow. Three months later, the organoids were about nine times their starting volume, ultimately making up about a third of one side of the rat’s cortex, the outer layer of the brain. “It pushes the rat cells aside,” Pasca says. “It grows as a unit.”</p>



<p>These human cells flourished because rats’ brains offer perks that lab dishes can’t, such as blood supply, a precise mix of nutrients and stimulation from nearby cells. This environmental support coaxed individual human neurons to grow bigger — six times as large by one measure — than the same sort of cells grown in dishes. Cells grown in the rat brains were also more complex, with more elaborate branching patterns and more cell connections called synapses.</p>

<p>The cells looked more mature, but Pasca and his colleagues wanted to know if the neurons would behave that way, too. Tests of electrical properties showed that implanted neurons behaved more similarly to cells that develop in human brains than cells grown in dishes.</p>



<p>Over months of growth, these human neurons made connections with their rat host cells. The human organoids were implanted in the somatosensory cortex, a part of the rat brain that handles whisker input. When researchers puffed air at the whiskers, some of the human cells responded.</p>



<p>What’s more, the human cells could influence the behavior of the rat. In further experiments, the researchers genetically tweaked the organoids to respond to blue light. Prompted by a flash of light, the neurons fired signals, and researchers rewarded the rats with water. Soon, the rats learned to move to the water spout when their human organoid cells sent signals.</p>



<p>In behavioral tests, rats with human implants didn’t show signs of higher intelligence or memory; in fact, researchers were more concerned with deficits. The human organoids were nudging out their hosts’ brains, after all. “Will there be memory deficits? Will there be motor deficits? Will there be seizures?” Pasca asked. But after extensive tests, including behavior tests, EEGs and MRIs, “we could not find differences,” Pasca says.<br><br>Other experiments included nerve cells from people with a genetic disorder called Timothy syndrome, a severe developmental disorder that affects brain growth. Growing organoids created with these patients’ cells in rats’ brains might reveal differences that other techniques would not, the researchers reasoned. Sure enough, neurons in these organoids had less complex message-receiving dendrites than those from organoids derived from people without the syndrome.</p>



<p>Organoids made from patient-specific cells could one day even serve as test subjects for treatments, Pasca says. “Challenging disorders will require bold approaches,” he says. “We will need to build human models that recapitulate more aspects of the human brain to study these uniquely human conditions.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/dart-mission-deflected-asteroid-for-planetary-defense">NASA’s DART mission successfully shoved an asteroid</a></h4>

              
                <p>It worked! Humanity has, for the first time, purposely moved a celestial object.</p>



<p>As a test of a potential asteroid-deflection scheme, NASA’s DART spacecraft shortened the orbit of asteroid Dimorphos by 32 minutes — a far greater change than astronomers expected.</p>



<p>The Double Asteroid Redirection Test, or DART, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/nasa-dart-asteroid-dimorphos-impact">rammed into the tiny asteroid</a> at about 22,500 kilometers per hour on September 26 (<em>SN: 9/26/22</em>). The goal was to move Dimorphos slightly closer to the larger asteroid it orbits, Didymos.</p>





<p>Neither Dimorphos nor Didymos pose any threat to Earth. DART’s mission was to help scientists figure out if a similar impact could nudge a potentially hazardous asteroid out of harm’s way before it hits our planet.</p>



<p>The experiment was a smashing success. Before the impact, Dimorphos orbited Didymos every 11 hours and 55 minutes. After, <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/press-release/nasa-confirms-dart-mission-impact-changed-asteroid-s-motion-in-space" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the orbit was 11 hours and 23 minutes</a>, NASA announced October 11 in a news briefing.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" width="680" height="334" src="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/101122_LG_DART_inline-1.gif" alt="A gif of two asteroids, one of which was hit by a spacecraft to change its orbit." class="wp-image-3118281" /><figcaption><span class="caption wp-caption-3118281">A small spacecraft called LICIACube, short for Light Italian CubeSat for Imaging of Asteroids, detached from DART just before impact, then buzzed the two asteroids to get a closeup view of the cosmic smashup. Starting from about 700 kilometers away, this series of images captures a bright plume of debris erupting from Dimorphos (right in the first half of this gif), evidence of the impact that shortened its orbit around Didymos (left). At closest approach, LICIACube was about 59 kilometers from the asteroids.</span><span class="credit wp-credit-3118281">ASI, NASA</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>“For the first time ever, humanity has changed the orbit of a planetary body,” said NASA planetary science division director Lori Glaze.</p>



<p>Four telescopes in Chile and South Africa observed the asteroids every night after the impact. The telescopes can’t see the asteroids separately, but they can detect periodic changes in brightness as the asteroids eclipse each other. All four telescopes saw eclipses consistent with an 11-hour, 23-minute orbit. The result was confirmed by two planetary radar facilities, which bounced radio waves off the asteroids to measure their orbits directly, said Nancy Chabot, a planetary scientist at Johns Hopkins Applied Physics Laboratory in Laurel, Md.</p>



<p>The minimum change for the DART team to declare success was 73 seconds — a hurdle the mission overshot by more than 30 minutes. The team thinks the spectacular plume of debris that the impactor kicked up gave the mission extra oomph. The impact itself gave some momentum to the asteroid, but the debris flying off in the other direction pushed it even more — like a temporary rocket engine.</p>



<p>“This is a very exciting and promising result for planetary defense,” Chabot said. But the change in orbital period was just 4 percent. “It just gave it a small nudge,” she said. So knowing an asteroid is coming is crucial to future success. For something similar to work on an asteroid headed for Earth, “you’d want to do it years in advance,” Chabot said. An upcoming space telescope called <a href="https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/missions/near-earth-object-surveyor" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Near-Earth Object Surveyor</a> is one of many projects intended to give that early warning.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/james-webb-space-telescope-stars-earliest-born-sparkler-galaxy">The James Webb Space Telescope spied the earliest born stars yet seen</a></h4>

              
                <p>Some of the earliest stars yet seen are now coming to light in one of the first images from the James Webb Space Telescope.</p>



<p>Formed roughly 800 million years after the Big Bang, the stars live in dense groups called globular clusters and surround <a href="https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/2041-8213/ac90ca" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a distant galaxy dubbed the Sparkler, </a>&nbsp;astronomers report in the Oct. 1<em> Astrophysical Journal Letters</em>. Globular clusters often host some of the oldest stars in contemporary galaxies such as our own, but it’s hard to tell their exact age. The new finding could help researchers pinpoint when such clusters began to form.</p>





<p>Compared to a galaxy, globular clusters are tiny, which makes them hard to see from across the universe. But this time, a gargantuan natural lens in space helped. The Sparkler is one of thousands of galaxies that lie far behind a <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/james-webb-space-telescope-first-image-nasa">massive, much closer galaxy cluster called SMACS 0723</a>, which was the subject of the first publicly released science image from the James Webb Space Telescope, or JWST (<em>SN: 7/11/22</em>). The cluster distorts spacetime such that the light from the more distant galaxies behind it is magnified.</p>



<p>For all those remote galaxies, that extra magnification brings out details that have never been seen before. One elongated galaxy surrounded by yellowish blobs got the attention of astronomer Lamiya Mowla and her colleagues.</p>



<p>“When we first saw it, we noticed all those little dots around it that we called ‘the sparkles,’” says Mowla, of the University of Toronto. The team <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/globular-star-cluster-surprising-few-heavy-elements">wondered if the sparkles could be globular clusters</a>, close-knit families of stars that are thought to have been born together and stay close to each other throughout their lives (<em>SN: 10/15/20</em>).</p>



<p>“The outstanding question that there still is, is how were the globular clusters themselves born?” Mowla says. Were they born at “cosmic noon,” 10 billion years ago, when star formation throughout the universe peaked? Or did they form 13 billion years ago at “<a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/universe-first-stars-cosmic-dawn-not-found">cosmic dawn</a>,” when stars were first able to form at all (<em>SN: 3/4/22</em>)?</p>



<p>Light from the Sparkler takes about 9 billion years to reach Earth, so if the sparkles are globular clusters that shone that long ago, they might help astronomers answer that question.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full is-resized"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/100622_lg_glob-cluster_inline1.jpg" alt="galaxy cluster SMACS 0723" class="wp-image-3118215" width="680" height="445" srcset="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/100622_lg_glob-cluster_inline1.jpg 680w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/100622_lg_glob-cluster_inline1-585x383.jpg 585w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/100622_lg_glob-cluster_inline1-284x186.jpg 284w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><figcaption><span class="caption wp-caption-3118215">Zooming into one part of JWST’s image of the galaxy cluster SMACS 0723, astronomers zeroed in on the yellow dots around this one elongated background galaxy, which they called the Sparkler. Some of the dots may be globular clusters of same-age stars formed just a few hundred million years after the Big Bang.</span><span class="credit wp-credit-3118215">L. Mowla <em>et al</em>/<em>The Astrophysical Journal Letters</em> 2022</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>Mowla and her colleagues used data from JWST to analyze the wavelengths of light coming from the sparkles. Some of them appear to be forming stars at the time when their light left the clusters. But some had formed all their stars long before.</p>



<p>“When we see them, the stars are already about 4 billion years old,” says astrophysicist Kartheik Iyer, also of the University of Toronto.</p>



<p>That means the oldest stars in the sparkles could have formed roughly 13 billion years ago. Since the universe is 13.8 billion years old, “there’s only a short amount of time after the Big Bang when these could have formed,” he says.</p>



<p>In other words, these clusters were born at dawn, not at noon.</p>



<p>Studying more globular clusters around ancient galaxies could help determine if such clusters are common or rare early on in the universe’s history. They could also help unravel galaxies’ formation histories, say Mowla and Iyer. Their team has proposed observations to be made in JWST’s first year that could do just that.</p>



<p>Being able to pick out tiny structures like globular clusters from so far away was almost impossible before JWST, says astronomer Adélaïde Claeyssens of Stockholm University. She was not involved in the new work but led a similar study earlier this year <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.10450" target="_blank" rel="noopener">of multiple galaxies magnified by the SMACS 0723 cluster</a>.</p>



<p>“It’s the first time we showed that, with James Webb, we will observe a lot of these type of galaxies with really tiny structures,” Claeyssens says. “James Webb will be a game changer for this field.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/nikon-small-world-photography-2022">A glimpse inside a gecko’s hand won the 2022 Nikon Small World photo contest</a></h4>

              
                <p>Life is beautiful at all scales, from big to small. Sometimes that splendor is concealed beneath literal scales.</p>



<p>A mesmerizing peek below the developing scales on the hand of an embryonic Madagascar giant day gecko (<em>Phelsuma grandis</em>) won first place in <a href="https://www.nikonsmallworld.com/galleries/photomicrography-competition" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the 2022 Nikon Small World photomicrography competition</a>. The winning image, stitched together from hundreds of images taken over two days with a confocal microscope, was crafted by University of Geneva researchers Grigorii Timin and Michel Milinkovitch. The pair study the genetics and physics of embryonic development.</p>



<p>The hand is artificially colored to show budding nerves in cyan and structures containing collagen in a range of oranges and yellows. Collagen is a building block of life, says Milinkovitch. Knowing where collagen is can help researchers better understand how bodies and tissues develop.</p>

<p>Parts of bones that have started to calcify shine brightest in the image, Timin says. Developing tendons and ligaments stretch as orange branches. Blood cells form clusters or line up inside new blood vessels at the tips of the gecko’s digits.</p>





<p>The image highlights beauty of all sizes, Milinkovitch says. The snapshot is “beautiful as a hand, you see this beautiful pattern of the fingers. Then you zoom, you see the spongy bones. And you zoom, you see the tendons. And you zoom, and you see the fibers that’s from the tendons. Then you zoom, and you see the blood cells.”</p>



<p>The gecko photo is one of 92 incredible images recognized in this year’s competition. The winners of the 48th annual contest <a href="https://www.nikonsmallworld.com/galleries/photomicrography-competition" target="_blank" rel="noopener">were announced</a> October 11.

<p>From a distance this photograph may look like a cluster of grapes. But each orb is a sprawling clump of cells inside breast tissue. &nbsp;</p>



<p>Cancer immunologist Caleb Dawson of the Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research in Parkville, Australia, took thousands of images using a confocal microscope to view tiny, musclelike cells that wrap around milk-producing spheres. He used dyes and antibodies to mark the cells yellow and magenta in this second-place-winning image.</p>



<p>The cells respond to the hormone oxytocin, Dawson says. Oxytocin is released during breastfeeding and helps squeeze milk out of the spheres, called alveoli. Such images of lactating breast tissue can help researchers figure out how immune cells keep breast tissue and the babies it can feed healthy.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<h3>Snuffed candle</h3>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full" data-component="lightbox"><img loading="lazy" width="1500" height="1875" src="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/100722_eg_nikon-awards_inline2.jpg" alt="a 2.5 times magnified photo of unburned pieces of carbon drifting away in wisps from an extinguished candle" class="wp-image-3118251" srcset="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/100722_eg_nikon-awards_inline2.jpg 1500w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/100722_eg_nikon-awards_inline2-306x383.jpg 306w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/100722_eg_nikon-awards_inline2-360x450.jpg 360w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/100722_eg_nikon-awards_inline2-149x186.jpg 149w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/100722_eg_nikon-awards_inline2-768x960.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/100722_eg_nikon-awards_inline2-1229x1536.jpg 1229w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/100722_eg_nikon-awards_inline2-464x580.jpg 464w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/100722_eg_nikon-awards_inline2-621x776.jpg 621w" sizes="(max-width: 1500px) 100vw, 1500px" /><figcaption><span class="caption wp-caption-3118251">Unburned pieces of carbon drift away from an extinguished candle in this photograph, magnified 2.5 times normal size.</span><span class="credit wp-credit-3118251">Ole Bielfeldt, Nikon Small World</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>Ole Bielfeldt had to be quick to capture the last gasp of an extinguished candle.</p>



<p>Candle wax is made of hydrogen and carbon atoms, which turn mostly into carbon dioxide when lit on fire. But not all those hydrocarbons burn, instead accumulating as soot on surfaces close to the candle. “When the flame goes out, the glowing wick has enough heat left to break up the wax molecules for a while, but not enough to burn the carbon,” says Bielfeldt, a photographer in Cologne, Germany. “So you get a trail of smoke until it cools.”</p>



<p>Using a fast shutter speed and a bright LED light, Bielfeldt managed to capture those unburned particles of carbon drifting away, earning sixth place.</p>



<h3>Iridescent slime mold</h3>

Most slime molds have smooth heads but this pair features what look like wrinkled pompoms.</span><span class="credit wp-credit-3118252">Alison Pollack, Nikon Small World</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>Hidden on leaves and decaying logs in moist forests are minuscule works of art like these <em>Lamproderma </em>slime molds.</p>



<p>In the dappled sun of an October day, photographer Alison Pollack of San Anselmo, Calif., saw a sparkly leaf as she was digging through a leaf pile. After taking the leaf home and looking through a microscope, she was transfixed by the crinkly heads and iridescence of slime mold. Around 40 hours of work and 147 combined images later, Pollack had captured a striking snapshot that she likes to anthropomorphize as a nurturing relationship: parent and child, two lovers, or brother and sister. The photo earned fifth place in the contest.</p>



<p>Most slime molds have smooth heads, which release spores into the environment to reproduce. This pair may have dried too fast, stunting their development and leaving their heads wrinkly, Pollack says. But that’s OK, “because the texture to me is just gorgeous.”</p>



<h3>A deadly predator</h3>

<p>All fear the predacious tiger beetle, especially this poor fly.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Murat Öztürk of Ankara, Turkey, nabbed 10th place in this year’s competition with an astounding — and unnerving — snapshot of a tiger beetle using its mandibles to crush a fly by its eyes.</p>



<p>Tiger beetles (<em>Cicindelinae</em>) sprint after their prey so quickly that the <a href="https://news.cornell.edu/stories/1998/01/tiger-beetles-go-blind-chasing-prey-high-speeds" target="_blank" rel="noopener">insects go temporarily blind</a>. The photographed beetle would have stopped multiple times to orient itself to figure out where the fly was, eventually snatching its meal. Thanks to the beetle’s strong and sharp jaws, “the chances of survival of the creatures caught by this insect are very low,” Öztürk says. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<h3>Coral close-up</h3>

Lewis/Queensland University of Technology, Nikon Small World</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>In Opal Reef off the coast of Australia, some cauliflower coral (<em>Pocillopora verrucosa</em>) polyps appear green. But the same organism is transformed when viewed under a microscope in the lab.</p>



<p>To reveal the polyp’s individual cells, marine scientist Brett Lewis of Queensland University of Technology in Brisbane, Australia, stitched together more than 60 images taken over 36 hours. The coral naturally fluoresces a medley of blues, purples and pinks when exposed to different wavelengths of light. Algae living inside the polyp appear orange or pink, while the coral’s tissues shine blue. The image won 12th place in the competition.</p>



<p>One amazing thing about the photo, Lewis says, is that in some areas, algal cells shine through a light blue haze. That’s because coral tissue is transparent; algae give coral its color.</p>



<p>Peeks of coral’s internal makings can help scientists understand its biology, Lewis says. His work, for instance, aims to figure out how young polyps build strong foundations when they attach to a surface — an important step in building or restoring coral reefs.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/sperm-swimming-groups-effectiveness-fertility">Cooperative sperm outrun loners in the mating race</a></h4>

              
                <p>Even sperm gotta stick together.</p>



<p>Bull sperm swim more effectively when in clusters, a new study shows, potentially offering insight into fertility in humans. In simulated reproductive tracts of animals like cattle and humans, the behavior increases the chances that <a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fcell.2022.961623/full" target="_blank" rel="noopener">groups of cooperative bovine sperm will outpace meandering loners</a> as they race to fertilize a female egg cell, physicist Chih-kuan Tung and colleagues report September 22 in <em>Frontiers in Cell and Developmental Biology</em>.</p>



<p>The benefits of clustering don’t come down to flat-out speed. “They are not faster,” says Tung, of North Carolina Agricultural and Technical State University in Greensboro. “In terms of speed, they are comparable or slower” than sperm traveling alone. Like the sperm equivalent of herds of tortoises racing individual hares, the winners are not necessarily the swiftest but rather the ones that can stay on target.</p>





<p>On their own, sperm tend to follow curved paths — which is a problem, because the shortest distance between two points is a straight line. But when sperm gather in groups of two or more, they swim along straighter routes. It’s behavior that a couple of the same researchers noted in a previous study where <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/birds-feather-sperm-flock-together">they tracked sperm swimming in stationary fluids</a> (<em>SN: 3/17/16</em>). Although that might give sperm clusters an advantage, it would only help if they happen to be going the right direction. Other benefits of sperm clustering weren’t clear until the researchers developed an experimental setup that introduced flowing fluid into their experiments.</p>



<p>In creatures like humans and cattle, sperm make their way to the ovum by swimming against a current of mucus that streams through the cervix and away from the uterus. It’s difficult to study what benefits clustering might confer while swimming upstream inside living beings. So Tung and colleagues created an analog in their lab: a shallow, narrow, 4-centimeter-long channel filled with a thick fluid that mimics natural mucus and flows at rates the researchers could control.</p>



<p>Whether alone or in groups, sperm naturally tend to swim upstream. However, clusters of sperm in the experiment did a better job heading upstream into the mucus flow, while individual sperm were more likely to head off in other directions. Despite the speedier travels of some individual sperm, a poorer ability to point upstream hampered the progress of sperm loners compared with slower moving clusters.</p>

</div><figcaption>In a thick, mucuslike fluid flowing from left to right, clusters of sperm travel more consistently against the flow than individual sperm do on their own.</figcaption></figure>



<p>Clusters also stayed the course in the face of rapidly flowing mucus. When the researchers turned up the flow in their apparatus, many individual sperm were washed away. Sperm clusters were much less likely to get swept downstream.</p>



<p>While sperm in the study were bovine, the advantages of clustering should also apply to human sperm, Tung says. Sperm of both species have similar dimensions. The swimmers typically compete to fertilize a single ovum. And unlike pigs or other animals where semen is deposited directly in the uterus, both human and bovine sperm start out in the vagina and travel through the cervix to get to the uterus.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Studying sperm in fluids that closely resemble the flowing mucus in reproductive tracts could reveal problems that don’t turn up in conventional observations of sperm swimming in stationary fluids, Tung says. “One hope is that this sort of knowledge can help us do better diagnoses” to provide clues to understand <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/sperm-show-age">infertility in humans</a> (<em>SN: 3/31/03</em>).</p>



<p>Subjecting sperm to realistic settings in the lab may soon offer <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/mysteries-reproduction-parenthood-ivf-fertilization">practical help for people who have trouble conceiving</a>, says fertility researcher Christopher Barratt of the University of Dundee in Scotland, who was not affiliated with the study (<em>SN: 6/9/21</em>).</p>



<p>“How a sperm cell responds to its surroundings and how that may change its behavior is a very important subject,” Barratt says. “This type of technology could be used, or adapted, to select better quality sperm,” for people in need of fertility assistance. “That would be a very big deal.”</p>

                <p><strong>Selected paper:</strong> <a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/73276">Calaim, Dehmelt, Gonçalves and Machens, The geometry of robustness in spiking neural networks, eLife (2022)</a></p>



<p><strong>The main message:</strong> This theoretical neuroscience paper describes an intuitive way how to think about the effect of single spikes in a network where the output and its error is closely monitored and used as feedback. This intuition is best illustrated by the video below. The video shows how the activity of a network tries to trace a target (in this case a sinus wave). Each neuron defines a boundary (the differently colored lines in the video in the 2D case). If the output of the network exceeds one such boundary surface, a corrective spike of the respective neuron is emitted. The signal is therefore kept in the target zone by being bounced back once it becomes incorrect. This enables us for example to think about cases where single neurons are perturbed &#8211; when they are excited, inhibited or when they die &#8211; in an intuitive and geometric way in terms of single spikes.</p>

<p><strong>The strong points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li>This visualization of the spiking dynamics in a neuronal network makes several points intuitively clear. For example, why such networks are robust to deletion or inhibition but not excitation of a single neuron (this is illustrated by deformations of the bounding box).<br /></li>



<li>More generally, the visualization makes it intuitive how neurons might be able to cooperate when taking advantage of such specific and fast feedback loops.<br /></li>



<li>This sort of simulated network tends to produce unphysiological or at least undesired behavior (discussed as &#8220;ping-pong&#8221; effect in the paper). This behavior becomes quite apparent and understandable due to the intuitive visualization.<br /></li>



<li>Finally, it is simply really cool to use this visualization tool and to think about redundant neurons as those neurons where the boundary surfaces in this bounding box have similar locations/orientations.</li>
</ul>



<p><strong>The weak points:</strong> </p>



<ul>
<li>The first weak point is that the presentation, despite the nice and intuitive video above, does not seem, from my perspective, accessible for everybody. Here, the task of the presented network is to approximate an externally supplied function (e.g., a sinus function). While many other neuroscientists, also many theoretical neuroscientists, think about neuronal networks as devices to represent information and to transform it, this paper therefore rather aims for a &#8220;control&#8221; approach. In my opinion, it is reasonable to think about the brain as a control device (to control the environment), but I feel that many readers might be already lost because they don&#8217;t understand why such an approach is taken. Only when reading the related work by the group (for an introduction, check out <a href="https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003258">Boerlin et al.</a>, PLoS Comp Biol (2013) or <a href="https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003258">Denève and Machens</a>, Nat Neuro (2016)), one understands that this property of function approximation could also be a useful model of normal operation of the brain, where the task is to react towards the environment and not to approximate a god-given function. I feel that the authors introduce their idea not in an ideal way to reach a broader audience, especially since I the general idea could in principle be understood by a broader audience.</li>
</ul>



<ul>
<li>It is not clear how the intuition about the effect of single spikes and the target zone in the bounding box would translate to other network architectures that do not follow the rather specific designs. These network designs were described in previous work by <a href="https://machenslab.org/">Christian Machens</a> and <a href="https://scholar.google.fr/citations?hl=fr&amp;user=PCzuQX8AAAAJ&amp;view_op=list_works&amp;sortby=pubdate">Sophie Denève</a> and feature a specific excitatory/inhibitory connectivity. A core feature of such networks is that the voltages of neurons are largely synchronized but their spiking is not, resulting in a seemingly asynchronous firing regime as found in the cortex, despite redundancy at the voltage behavior of single neurons.<br />This limitation also came up during the review process. The authors try to discuss these questions in detail and to address some of them, as much as possible, with additional analyses and models. Check out <a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/73276#sa1">the open reviews</a> (which are always accessible for eLife papers)!</li>
</ul>



<p><strong>Conclusion:</strong> I like the paper because it comes up with a surprising, new and maybe even useful idea. It attempts to think about the consequences and circumstances of a single neuron&#8217;s spike, and how the effect of this single spike on other neurons can be understood. As a caveat, all these intuitions come with the assumption that there is a closely monitored error of the output signal, which in turn is fed back into the system in a very precise manner. This assumption might seem very strong in the beginning. However, in order to understand things, we have to make some assumptions, and even from wrong assumptions, we might be able to develop first intuitions about what is going on. I would be curious whether and how this bounding box picture could be applied to other network architectures.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/tua-tagovailoa-concussion-traumatic-brain-injury-head-hit-risk">Why traumatic brain injuries raise the risk of a second, worse hit</a></h4>

              
                <p>In a football game on September 25, Miami Dolphins quarterback Tua Tagovailoa got the pass off but he got knocked down. Fans watched him shake his head and stumble to the ground as he tried to jog it off. After a medical check, he went back into the game against the Buffalo Bills with what his coach later said was a back injury.</p>



<p>Four days later, in a game against the Cincinnati Bengals, Tagovailoa, 24, got hit again. This time, he left the field on a stretcher with what was later diagnosed as a concussion.</p>





<p>Many observers suspect that the first hit — given Tagovailoa’s subsequent headshaking and wobbliness — left the athlete with a concussion, also called a mild traumatic brain injury. If those were indeed signs of a head injury, that first hit may have lined him up for an even worse brain injury just days later.</p>



<p>“The science tells us that yes, a person who is still recovering from a concussion is at an elevated risk for sustaining another concussion,” says Kristen Dams-O’Connor, a neuropsychologist and director of the Brain Injury Research Center at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai in New York City. As one example, <a href="https://www.bmj.com/content/346/bmj.f723" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a concussion roughly doubled the chance of a second one</a> among young Swedish men, researchers reported in 2013 in the <em>British Medical Journal</em>.</p>



<p>“This, I think, was avoidable,” Dams-O’Connor says of Tagovailoa’s brain injury in the game against the Bengals.</p>



<p>After a hit to the head, when the soft brain hits the unyielding skull, the injury kicks off a cascade of changes. Some nerve cells become overactive, inflammation sets in, and blood flow is altered. These downstream events in the brain — and how they relate to concussion symptoms — can happen over hours and days, and are not easy to quickly measure, Dams-O’Connor says.</p>



<p>That makes diagnosing a concussion tricky. Clinicians often have to rely on patients saying they feel off or fuzzy. Professional athletes might not be eager to share those symptoms if it means they’ll be sidelined. “These are elite athletes who are conditioned to suck it up,” Dams-O’Connor says.</p>



<p>Other signs can indicate a concussion, such as a person’s gait or pupil dilation. “As clinicians, we are often triangulating multiple sources of information to make that call — was this or was this not a concussion?” Dams-O’Connor says. The scientific uncertainty in that call should lead clinicians to err on the side of caution, she says.</p>



<p>&nbsp;After a traumatic brain injury, recuperation is crucial. “It’s much worse when an individual isn’t given the proper time to rest and recover and gets a second impact in a close period of time,” says Daniel Daneshvar, a brain injury medicine doctor and neuroscientist at Mass General Brigham in Boston and Harvard Medical School. Looking at the brains of mice after two close-together hits, researchers have seen signs of <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/mouse-study-offers-clues-brains-response-concussions">worse damage and a longer recovery</a> (<em>SN: 2/5/16</em>).</p>



<p>For athletes, that vulnerability comes in part from concussion symptoms themselves. Slowed reaction times, dizziness and double vision confound a quick-moving quarterback who needs to dodge tackles and see opponents coming from the side. Those symptoms can lead to further injury to the head — and to the rest of the body. A concussion <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9402462/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">increases the risks</a> of lower extremity injuries, according to a recent analysis of National Football League players published in August in <em>Arthroscopy, Sports Medicine, and Rehabilitation</em>.</p>



<p>What’s more, a healing brain is more susceptible to jarring. While the brain is still recovering in the weeks after an injury, “your threshold for getting a concussion is lower,” Daneshvar says. A lighter hit, researchers suspect, can do more damage. A rare condition called second impact syndrome illustrates an extreme outcome of successive brain injuries. This catastrophic, often fatal brain swelling happens when a still-healing brain is hit again.</p>



<p>That’s not what happened to Tagovailoa. But two concussions close together can delay recovery, Dams-O’Connor emphasizes. “I think people minimize how life-altering that can be.”</p>



<p>In a statement, the NFL and the NFL Players Association announced that they are jointly investigating whether their concussion protocols were followed in this case. Tagovailoa may have been allowed back into that first game because his stumbling was attributed — correctly or not — to a back injury, not a brain injury. The NFL and NFLPA are considering changing the protocol to keep a player out of a game for any obvious motor instability, regardless of cause.</p>



<p>For now, Tagovailoa is moving through the stages of recovery outlined in the concussion protocol. In a social media post on September 30, Tagovailoa <a href="https://twitter.com/Tua/status/1575961296423784449/photo/1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">thanked</a> his team, friends and family and everyone who has reached out in support. “I’m feeling much better and focused on recovering so I can get back out on the field with my teammates,” he wrote.</p>
