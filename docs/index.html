              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/deadly-bacteria-infection-medieval-child-haemophilus-influenzae-type-b">A deadly bacteria has been infecting children for more than 1,400 years</a></h4>

              
                <p>The tragic death of a 6-year-old boy in early medieval England has given scientists the earliest direct clue to the history of the pathogen <em>Haemophilus influenzae</em> type b. Dated to about 550, it’s <a href="https://genomebiology.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13059-021-02580-z">the oldest case of this bacterial infection</a>, called Hib, ever diagnosed, researchers report February 2 in <em>Genome Biology</em>.</p>



<p>The next confirmed case occurred more than 1,300 years later in 1892, when <em>H. influenzae</em> was first identified. Despite the similar name and symptoms to influenza, the bacterium doesn’t cause flu. But Hib can cause other serious illnesses such as <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/ominous-drug-resistance-hints-appear">pneumonia and meningitis</a> — especially in young children (<em>SN: 1/9/02</em>). Since the late 1980s, a vaccine against Hib has <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/bacterial-meningitis-keeps-falling">largely sidelined the pathogen</a> (<em>SN: 5/25/11</em>).</p>



<p>DNA in a tooth from the boy, who was buried in a plague cemetery in Cambridgeshire, indicates that Hib was infecting people at the same time as the first historically documented pandemic due to <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/an-ancient-outbreak-of-bubonic-plague-may-have-been-exaggerated">plague, caused by the bacterium <em>Yersinia pestis</em></a> (<em>SN: 12/2/19</em>). The relationship between <em>H. influenzae</em> and humans, the pathogen’s only host, is probably much older than that, says Meriam Guellil, a paleogeneticist at the University of Tartu in Estonia.</p>



<p>Unsurprisingly, the boy’s tooth also contained genetic remains of <em>Y. pestis</em>. He probably contracted the Hib infection first, Guellil and colleagues say. While respiratory infections rarely leave marks, the boy’s kneecaps had fused to the thighbones above them. Such damage can happen when Hib escapes the respiratory system and infects joints, which would have taken weeks. This boy was already quite ill when he caught <em>Y. pestis</em>, but “plague, probably, was what killed him,” Guellil says.</p>

<p>This kind of research opens a window into how pathogens evolve to start pandemics or die out over thousands to millions of years. The work is a “great advance” for archaeology, history and the study of ancient diseases, says Pontus Skoglund, an expert in ancient genomics at the Francis Crick Institute in London who was not involved in the study. “The well-authenticated detection of <em>Haemophilus influenzae</em> in an early medieval child promises that it will be detectable in more cases in history, and potentially prehistory,” he says.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://liorpachter.wordpress.com/2022/02/02/a-decade-of-molecular-cell-atlases/">A decade of molecular cell atlases</a></h4>

              
                <p>A recent opinion piece titled &#8220;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.cell.com/trends/genetics/fulltext/S0168-9525(22)00004-X" target="_blank">A decade of molecular cell atlases</a>&#8221; by Stephen Quake narrates the incredible single-cell genomics technology advances that have taken place over the last decade, and how they have translated to increasingly resolved cell atlases. While the article tells some fascinating stories (apparently when hearing a report about the CZI mouse cell atlas Priscilla Chan remarked &#8220;why don&#8217;t we just do human?&#8221; and thus the idea for a human cell atlas was born), it contains several errors and omissions. I have summarized some of them below, and have sent a copy to Trends in Genetics, where the opinion piece was published, requesting corrections: </p>



<ul><li> Quake writes that &#8220;The year <strong>2017</strong> marked the release of our&nbsp;<em>Tabula Muris</em>&nbsp;data set and preprint&#8221; and cites the <a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/237446v2">2nd version of a preprint on the bioRxiv</a> posted on <strong>March 29, 2018</strong>, that later became an <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-018-0590-4" target="_blank">article in Nature </a>on <strong>October 3, 2018</strong>. While it is true that the preprint was first posted on <strong>December 20, 2017</strong>, at that time the data was not released. The data was only released in the 2nd version of the preprint on <strong>March 29, 2018</strong> (the data was made <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE109774">publicly available on GEO at accession GSE109774 on March 19, 2018</a>). Without the data, namely the reads which were processed, it is not possible to verify or reproduce results from a paper, nor, in the case of single-cell transcriptomics, is it possible to build on work by uniformly processing it together with a new dataset for joint analysis. Notably, Quake&#8217;s false claim that the preprint and data was released in <strong>2017</strong> is a repeat of what he stated in a lecture titled &#8220;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=48wfaeg6MU0&amp;t=1843s" target="_blank">The Cell is a Bag of RNA</a>&#8221; (an apt <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.chemistryworld.com/features/catalysts-of-creation/3004523.article" target="_blank">analogy of David Lilley</a>). In the lecture Quake specifically said that &#8220;in this whole gap [from <strong>December 20, 2017</strong> until the paper was published in <strong>October 2018</strong>] where normally you wouldn&#8217;t have access to the paper or the data, the whole world did because we put it on the [bio]arXiv&#8230; not just the manuscript but <em>all the data</em>.&#8221;</li></ul>

<ul><li>The error in describing the date when the <em>Tabula Muris</em> data was shared is significant in light of Quake&#8217;s narrative that <em>Tabula Muris</em> was &#8220;the first mammalian whole-organism cell atlas&#8221;.  Quake describes another single-cell RNA-seq based mouse cell atlas published by <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://person.zju.edu.cn/en/ggj" target="_blank">Guoji Guo</a>&#8216;s group at Zhejiang University on <strong>February 22, 2018</strong> (Han et al., <a href="https://www.cell.com/cell/pdf/S0092-8674(18)30116-8.pdf">Mapping the Mouse Cell Atlas by Microwell-Seq</a>, <em>Cell</em>), as &#8220;further work&#8221;. Guo&#8217;s data was publicly available on GEO on <strong>February 14, 2018</strong> (<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE108097">GSE 108097</a>) along with the publication, a date that preceded the release of the <em>Tabula Muris</em> data. In fact, in the <em>Tabula Muris </em>preprint update on <strong>March 29, 2018</strong>, the <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.cell.com/cell/pdf/S0092-8674(18)30116-8.pdf" target="_blank">Han et al. 2018 paper</a> data is analyzed in conjunction with the <em>Tabula Muris</em> data, with the authors concluding that &#8220;independent datasets generated from various atlases that are beginning to arise can be combined and collectively analyzed&#8230;&#8221;. Thus, it was the <em>Tabula Muris</em> paper that was &#8220;further work&#8221; following the <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.cell.com/cell/pdf/S0092-8674(18)30116-8.pdf" target="_blank">Han et al. 2018 paper</a>, not the other way around. The timeline that Quake presents is shown on the left (screenshot from his &#8220;The Cell is a Bag of RNA&#8221; talk); the actual (edits by me in red) timeline is on the right:</li></ul>

<ul><li>Quake mischaracterizes another paper from the Guo group, namely Han et al., <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2157-4" target="_blank">Construction of a human cell landscape at single-cell level</a>, Nature, 2020. He refers to this paper as one of several that represent &#8220;a distinct strategy of compiling cell atlases one tissue at a time.&#8221; However the <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2157-4" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Han et al. 2020 paper</a> analyzed samples of both fetal and adult tissue, and covered 60 human tissue types which were assayed in (2-4) replicates. <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2157-4" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Han et al. 2020</a> also examined several types of cell culture, including induced pluripotent stem cells, embryoid body cells, haematopoietic cells derived from co-cultures of human H9 and mouse OP9 cells, and pancreatic beta cells derived from H9 cells. The scope of the <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2157-4" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Han et al. 2020 paper</a> is apparent in Figure 1 of their paper:</li></ul>

<ul><li>Quake similarly misrepresents two other human cell atlas papers, namely He et al. <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s13059-020-02210-0" target="_blank">Single-cell transcriptome profiling of an adult human cell atlas of 15 major organs</a>, Genome Biology, 2020. This paper, whose title makes clear it mapped cell types in 15 organs, is also described by Quake as  &#8220;representing a distinct strategy of compiling cell atlases one tissue at a time&#8221; implying that only one tissue or organ was assayed. The same is the case for Cao et al., <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.aba7721" target="_blank">A human cell atlas of fetal gene expression</a>, Science 2020, which derived cell types using single-cell gene expression and chromatin landscape data from 15 organs. </li><li>When highlighting &#8220;his&#8221;<em>Tabula Sapiens</em> which was first preprinted in 2021 , Quake fails to mention the human cell atlas papers above, and instead mentions only preprints from the <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.07.19.452954" target="_blank">Broad</a> and <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.04.28.441762v2" target="_blank">Sanger</a> which were also published in 2021, and a paper from what he calls a &#8220;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.science.org/doi/full/10.1126/sciadv.abh2169" target="_blank">Swedish consortium</a>&#8221; (the work was conceived and designed by Mathias Uhlén and Cecilia Lindskog). This omission makes it seem that <em>Tabula Sapiens</em> was the first human cell atlas to be published, along with a handful of others preprinted at the same time and one published concurrently, when in fact that was not the case.</li><li>Quake characterizes the <em>Tabula Muris</em> as &#8220;representing the first mammalian whole-organism cell atlas.&#8221; As noted above, it was not &#8220;first&#8221;, but priority claims aside, the description as a &#8220;whole-organism cell atlas&#8221; needs to be qualified. Here is how the project is characterized in the published paper: &#8220;Although these data are by no means a complete representation of all mouse organs and cell types, they provide a first draft attempt to create an organism-wide representation of cellular diversity.&#8221; </li><li>In reviewing the technology developments that led to high-throughput single-cell RNA-seq, Quake omits several important advances. There is a large body of work to refer to and cite, including several key advances in barcoding of beads to identify cells and barcoding for distinguishing molecules. For the latter, see, e.g., <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.pnas.org/content/109/4/1347.short" target="_blank">Shiroguchi et al., 2012</a> (from the lab of Sunney Xie). </li><li>The paper declares 2011-2012 to be &#8220;seminal years&#8221; in conceptualizing the notion of a transcriptomic cell atlas. While it&#8217;s true that those were &#8220;seminal&#8221; years for Quake when he published his own sperm (<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.cell.com/fulltext/S0092-8674(12)00789-1" target="_blank">Wang et al., 2012</a>), the timeline seems arbitrary and possibly self-serving. The <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nmeth.1315" target="_blank">Tang et al. paper in 2009</a> could just as well be taken as the starting point for &#8220;conceptualizing the notion of a transcriptomic cell atlas. Tang et al. write specifically that &#8220;For example, mouse embryonic stem cells, probably the most thoroughly analyzed type of stem cells, contain multiple subpopulations with strong differences in both gene expression and physiological function. Therefore, a more sensitive mRNA-Seq assay, ideally an assay capable of working at single cell resolution, is needed to meaningfully study crucial developmental processes and stem cell biology.&#8221; Similarly, Long et al., in &#8220;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nmeth.1366" target="_blank">A 3D digital atlas of&nbsp;<em>C. elegans</em>&nbsp;and its application to single-cell analyses</a>&#8221; published in 2009, were anticipating the notion of a transcriptomic cell atlas&#8221;, noting that their technology would be particularly useful for &#8220;high-throughput analysis of cellular information such as gene expression at single-cell resolution.&#8221; Alternatively, a reasonable starting point for consideration could be 2014, when cells actually started to be assayed en masse:</li></ul>

<ul><li>The Long et al. paper brings to the fore the field of spatial transcriptomics, which Quake ignores entirely in his review. However, conceptualization of the notion of a transcriptomic cell atlas was happening by scientists in that field; in fact spatial transcriptomics was arguably the domain where most of the ideas pervasive in single-cell genomics today originated (see, the <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.05.11.443152v2" target="_blank">Museum of Spatial Transcriptomics</a> for a detailed history and review).</li><li>Another important omission in the Quake opinion is the discussion of the computational biology technologies crucial for cell atlases. None of the <em>Tabula </em>papers, or for that matter any of the single-cell transcriptomics papers that have been written during the past few years would have been possible without the <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://satijalab.org/seurat/" target="_blank">Seurat</a> and <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://scanpy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/" target="_blank">Scanpy</a> programs from the Satija and Theis labs respectively. More importantly, the atlases themselves are, fundamentally, a product of the computational tools used to analyze the data. For example, in the <em>Tabula Microcebus </em>the annotated cell types were obtained by analyzing the 10X Genomics single-cell RNA-seq data &#8220;through dimensionality reduction&nbsp;by principal component analysis, visualization in 2-dimensional projections with t-Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE) and Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP), and clustering by the Louvain method.&#8221; These methods are tuned with numerous parameters and even evaluating when they are accurate is challenging (<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41576-018-0088-9" target="_blank">Kiselev et al., 2019</a>). In regards to dimensionality reduction, there are numerous problems that have been documented with the t-SNE and UMAP leading to questions about results based on interpreting them (see, e.g., <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.08.25.457696v3" target="_blank">Chari et al., 2021</a>, <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/689851v6" target="_blank">Cooley et al., 2022</a>). The only mention of computational technology in the article is a comment that &#8220;Similarly, the development of new algorithms and computational approaches was also a powerful enabler of the field as it now exists.&#8221; </li><li>The omission of computational technology is chalked up to space constraints, yet there was apparently enough space for the Quake to narrate an origin story of the Human Cell Atlas project in which he centers himself, instead of Aviv Regev and Sarah Teichmann whose contribution was much more than to have &#8220;asked whether various efforts should be merged into an international collaboration&#8221;. They were early champions of a collaborative human cell atlas project and have co-chaired the organizing committee from the outset. Teichmann co-founded the <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.ebi.ac.uk/about/news/announcements/single-cell-centre" target="_blank">Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute Single Cell Genomics Centre</a> in 2013, and by 2015 had been awarded the <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.eurekalert.org/news-releases/556250" target="_blank">EMBO Gold Medal </a>in part for her contributions to, and vision for, single-cell transcriptomics. Regev pioneered many of the single-cell RNA-seq technology developments that enabled single-cell genomics, including <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nature12172" target="_blank">single-cell studies of immune cells in 2013</a> and  <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nbt.3192" target="_blank">spatial single-cell RNA-seq in 2015</a>. By the time of the inaugural Human Cell Atlas meeting in London in 2016, Regev had been widely publicizing a vision for a &#8220;periodic table of cells&#8221; and Teichmann had joined forces with her to develop a joint vision to accomplish the task (see <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://psmag.com/environment/creating-an-atlast-of-human-cells" target="_blank">article in the Pacific Standard, 2018</a>).</li><li>There are a few minor errors in the paper. Quake writes that &#8220;These [microfluidics automation technologies] were eventually commercialized by a company I founded called Fluidigm..&#8221;. In fact, Quake did not found Fluidigm by himself; the company was <em>co-founded</em> with <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20170501005558/en/Chan-Zuckerberg-Biohub-Names-Gajus-Worthington-Chief-Operating-Officer" target="_blank">Gajus Worthington</a>. Miriam Merad&#8217;s name is incorrectly spelled as &#8220;Meriam&#8221; and Christophe Benoist&#8217;s name is incorrectly spelled as &#8220;Benoiste&#8221;. A recurring typo is the misspelling of Sarah Teichmann&#8217;s name. It is incorrectly spelled &#8220;Teichman&#8221; three times throughout the manuscript, including in the Acknowledgment section where she is thanked for specific comments on the manuscript.</li></ul>



<p>A broader point regarding cell atlases is that defining cell types, distinguishing cell types from cell states, and comprehensively organizing cells in any species in a meaningful framework, is a monumental task that we are only beginning to tackle. There are no definitive human or mouse cell atlases yet, and there won&#8217;t be for some time. Among the &#8220;atlases&#8221; published so far there is little consensus. The <em>Tabula Muris</em>,  cell atlas annotates far fewer cell types than <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.cell.com/cell/pdf/S0092-8674(18)30116-8.pdf" target="_blank">Han et al., 2018</a>, perhaps because the latter assayed many more cells. Similarly, the fly cell atlas by <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.07.04.451050v1" target="_blank">Li et al., 2021</a> lists ~250 cell types in comparison to the <em>Tabula Sapiens </em>that finds ~400 in human. Perhaps these similar numbers do not reflect fundamental shared biology or a universal organizing principle for cells, but rather the fact that both projects sequenced similar numbers of cells (~580k vs. 500k respectively). Unsurprisingly, the number of annotated cell types in publications is strongly correlated with the number of cells assayed:</p>

<p>The brain presents an especially daunting challenge. An entire recent <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.nature.com/collections/cicghheddj/" target="_blank">issue of Nature </a>was devoted to only one region: the primary motor cortex. Frankly, opinion pieces elbowing for priority claims are neither appropriate nor interesting. To the extent that the human cell atlas will ever become a meaningful accomplishment it will have been a project without a single winner. Instead, it will have been a collaborative effort of thousands of scientists from across the world who will have deepened our understanding of biology to the benefit of all.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/cancer-genetically-engineered-immune-cells-car-t-therapy-remission">Genetically engineered immune cells have kept two people cancer-free for a decade</a></h4>

              
                <p>In 2010, two blood cancer patients received an experimental immunotherapy, and their cancers went into remission. Ten years later, the <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-021-04390-6">cancer-fighting immune cells used in the therapy were still around</a>, a sign the treatment can be long-lasting, researchers report February 2 in <em>Nature</em>.</p>



<p>California resident Doug Olsen was one of the patients. “From a patient’s viewpoint, when you’re told you’re pretty much out of options, the important thing is always to maintain hope. And certainly, I hoped this was going to work,” Olsen said at a February 1 news briefing.</p>



<p>The treatment, known as <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/how-make-car-t-cell-therapies-cancer-safer-and-more-effective">CAR-T cell therapy</a>, used the patients’ own genetically engineered immune cells to track down and kill cancerous cells (<em>SN: 6/27/18</em>). Based on the results, “we can now conclude that CAR-T cells can actually cure patients with leukemia,” cancer immunologist and study coauthor Carl June of the University of Pennsylvania said at the briefing.</p>



<p>Olsen and the other patient had chronic lymphocytic leukemia. Both responded well to initial treatment. But it was unclear how long the modified cells would stick around, preventing the cancer’s return.</p>



<p>Cancer doctors and researchers “don’t use words like ‘cure’ lightly or easily,” said oncologist and study coauthor David Porter of the University of Pennsylvania at the briefing. But with both patients remaining cancer-free for more than a decade, he said, the therapy has performed “beyond our wildest expectations.”</p>



<p>The biggest disappointment is that the immunotherapy doesn’t work for everyone, Porter added. Some people don’t respond to the treatment. Others can develop <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/exploding-cancer-cells-can-cause-serious-side-effects-car-t-cell-therapies">dangerous side effects</a> (<em>SN: 1/17/20</em>). But researchers are “starting to learn the mechanism of why and how it works, so that we can start to get at how to make it work for more people,” he said.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/vinegar-eels-swim-wiggle-synchronize-nematodes">Vinegar eels can synchronize swim</a></h4>

              
                <p>Trapped within a bead of water, thousands of tiny worms wiggle in hypnotic synchrony as they stream around the globule’s rim. And at the center of this undulating gyre some of the creatures congregate into a writhing mass, like the pupil of a demonic eye.</p>



<p>These squiggling creatures are <em>Turbatrix aceti</em>, a species of nematode commonly known as vinegar eels. Individual vinegar eels are often found swimming freely in jars of raw vinegar or in fish tanks. But when troupes of them assemble, vinegar eels showcase a unique juggling act of behaviors; they can <a href="https://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlelanding/2022/SM/D1SM01572A">wiggle in synch as they move together in swarms</a>, researchers report January 10 in <em>Soft Matter</em>.</p>



<p>This captivating ability is exceedingly rare in nature. <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/birds-turns-match-math-quantum-matter">Birds</a> and <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/50-million-year-old-fossil-captures-swimming-school-fish">fish</a> can move collectively, while <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/swimming-bacteria-remove-resistance-flow">some bacteria can coordinate the waving of whiplike appendages </a>&nbsp;(<em>SN: 7/31/14; SN:</em> <em>5/28/19; SN: 7/13/15</em>). Vinegar eels, however, are capable of more. “This is a combination of two different kinds of synchronization,” says Anton Peshkov, a physicist at the University of Rochester in New York. “Motion and oscillation.”</p>







<p>Peshkov and his colleagues first heard rumors of vinegar eels’ weird motions while studying the group movements of brine shrimp, another common aquarium dweller. Intrigued, they packed thousands of <em>T. aceti</em> into droplets to observe under a microscope.</p>



<p>The nematodes first roamed randomly, but over the course of an hour, some began clustering in the middle. Others swarmed to the edges, where they circled the rim. After a while, individual nematodes started oscillating in synch, and the swarm itself began undulating, like fans doing the wave at a sports game.</p>

</div><figcaption><em>Turbatrix aceti</em>, also known as vinegar eels, are millimeters-long nematodes that are able to school like fish and synchronize their swimming. This juggling act of behaviors is rare in nature.</figcaption></figure>



<p>These collective undulations stirred up flows that prevented the water drop’s edge from contracting as it evaporated. But as evaporation progressed, the edge instead gradually tilted inwards, weakening the swarm’s outward push, until the walls finally began to close in. At this tipping point, the researchers measured the drop’s dimensions, which let them estimate that each vinegar eel generated 1 micronewton of force. They could move objects hundreds of times their own weight, Peshkov says.</p>



<p>It remains unclear why vinegar eels exhibit this bizarre behavior. “Nematodes are too small to observe in their natural environment,” says Serena Ding, a biologist at the Max Planck Institute of Animal Behavior in Konstanz, Germany, who was not involved in the study. Figuring out the natural cause for this behavior is difficult using lab observations, since captive creatures act differently, she says.</p>



<p>Peshkov speculates vinegar eels might swarm tightly to minimize their bodies’ exposure to corrosive free radicals in water, or maybe they generate flows to move nutrients.</p>



<p>Regardless, Ding says, “this is cool.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2022/02/02/we-put-more-effort-into-avoiding-losses-than-making-gains/">We put more effort into avoiding losses than making gains</a></h4>

              
                <p><em>By</em> <a href="https://emmayoung.net/">Emma Young</a></p>



<p>The discovery that we care more about losses than equivalent gains has been hugely influential in behavioural economics. The idea was introduced back in 1979, in <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/1914185?origin=crossref">a paper by Dan Kahneman and Amos Tversky</a>. Since then, it’s been demonstrated in a huge range of settings, and led to some effective interventions for everything from sales teams to students. Take <a href="https://libres.uncg.edu/ir/asu/f/McEvoy_Dave_2016_Loss%20Aversion.pdf">this finding from 2016</a>: when students are given maximum grade points at the start of the semester and then lose points according to their performance in exams and assignments, they do better in the end than students who start with zero points and must work to accrue grade points instead.</p>



<p>It’s often assumed that these interventions work because people choose to exert more effort to avoid losses than to make equivalent gains. But there has been only limited work to explore this, write Ana Farinha and Tiago Maia at the University of Lisbon, in their <a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2021-27045-001">new paper</a> in the <em>Journal of Experimental Psychology: General.</em> So the pair set out to investigate. They used an experimental set-up that focused not on task performance — as is generally the case in this field of research — but rather on how much effort participants opted to make to avoid losses or make gains.</p>



<span id="more-45245"></span>



<p>In the first study, 32 young adults had to &#8220;inflate&#8221; one of two balloons that were presented to them on a screen, either to gain points, or to prevent the loss of points. One of the balloons was always relatively easy to inflate — taking 25 presses on the spacebar using the index finger of the non-dominant hand. To inflate the other, a participant had to press the spacebar 75 times with the pinky finger of their non-dominant hand. This was the &#8220;high effort&#8221; balloon.</p>



<p>There were also two trial types. In the &#8220;gain&#8221; type, screen indicators showed that inflating the high effort balloon would give the participant a number of points (the number varied across trials), while the low effort option was literally pointless. In the &#8220;loss&#8221; type, inflating the low effort balloon led to a loss of points, while inflating the high effort balloon prevented loss, preserving the participant’s points balance. In both cases, then, going for the high effort option was always better for achieving the goal of having as many points as possible at the end.</p>



<p>The results were clear: the participants chose to exert more effort to prevent losses than to gain points. In the loss-avoidance trials, they went for the high effort option 79% of the time, whereas the figure for gain trials was only 59%.</p>



<p>The team also ran a similar experiment with 29 children aged 7 to 17. And they found a very similar pattern of results. The children went for their high effort option in 84% of loss-avoidance trials but only 64% for gain trials.<br><br>These percentages were group averages. But Farinha and Maia report that a difference was clear for most individuals, even the children. This, plus the large and very similar effect sizes that they found in their analysis of the adult and child data, suggests that this effect might reflect a fundamental feature of human behaviour, they write. However, they do also concede that this would need checking “across laboratories, contexts and cultures.”</p>



<p>For now, the pair argues that the main importance of the new work is this: “Our findings demonstrate, arguably more definitively than other work, that people <em>explicitly choose </em>to exert more effort to avoid losses than to obtain gains.” (Their italics.)</p>



<p>The fact that children showed very similar results to the adults was significant, the team adds. Though all kinds of successful interventions for adults are based on our stronger aversion to loss than drive for gain, this isn’t something that has been applied in schools — at least, certainly not widely. There might be some arguments for doing so: if kids are motivated to expend more effort, they should do better. However, there are also reasons to be extremely cautious. Young children, especially, could easily view deductions as punishments — and that could lead to anxiety.</p>



<p>There is clearly a long way to go in this field. But, hopefully, new work will lead to more, and better, ways to help us all to achieve our goals.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/covid-brain-fog-coronavirus-immune-response-fatigue">A faulty immune response may be behind lingering brain trouble after COVID-19</a></h4>

              
                <p>A tussle with COVID-19 can leave people’s brains fuzzy. SARS-CoV-2, the virus behind COVID-19, doesn’t usually make it into the brain directly. But the immune system’s response to even mild cases can affect the brain, new preliminary studies suggest. These reverberating effects may lead to fatigue, trouble thinking, difficulty remembering and even pain, months after the infection is gone.</p>



<p>It’s not a new idea. Immune systems gone awry have been implicated in cognitive problems that come with other viral infections such as HIV and influenza, with disorders such as myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome, or ME/CSF, and even from the damaging effects of chemotherapy.</p>



<p>What’s different with COVID-19 is the scope of the problem. Millions of people have been infected, says neurologist Avindra Nath of the National Institutes of Health in Bethesda, Md. “We are now faced with a public health crisis,” he says.</p>

<p>To figure out ways to treat people for the <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/covid-brain-coronavirus-symptom-stroke-anxiety-depression">fuzzy thinking, headaches and fatigue</a> that hang around after a bout with COVID-19, scientists are racing to figure out what’s causing these symptoms (<em>SN: 4/27/21</em>). Cognitive neurologist Joanna Hellmuth at the University of California, San Francisco had a head start. As someone who had studied the effects of HIV on the brain, she quickly noted similarities in the neurological symptoms of HIV and COVID-19. The infections paint “the same exact clinical picture,” she says.</p>



<p>HIV-related cognitive symptoms have been linked to immune activation in the body, including the brain. “Maybe the same thing is happening in COVID,” Hellmuth says.</p>



<p>She and her colleagues looked for differences in the fluid that surrounds the brain and spinal cord in 13 people who had lingering cognitive symptoms from COVID-19 and four people who had no cognitive symptoms. The four people without cognitive symptoms had normal cerebrospinal fluid. But 10 of the 13 people who did have lasting symptoms had abnormalities in their fluid, some of which point to immune system reactions.</p>





<p>So far, the analyses can’t pinpoint the precise changes that may be important. Possible suspects are antibodies that can mistakenly attack key proteins in the brain, the researchers say.</p>



<p>The results, published January 19 in <em>Annals of Clinical and Translational Neurology</em>, <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/epdf/10.1002/acn3.51498">raise many more questions</a>, but show that there’s a real difference in the cerebrospinal fluid, Hellmuth says. “This is a very small study, but the data suggest that there’s a real biological basis in these COVID-related cognitive changes,” she says. “These are not just people who are stressed out … we’re seeing abnormalities that are not typically seen in brain fluid.”</p>

<p>More hints to the brain troubles come from an <a href="https://doi.org/10.1101/2022.01.07.475453">analysis</a> of mice and people, posted January 10 at bioRxiv.org, that has not yet been reviewed by other scientists. By analyzing human tissue and mice infected with SARS-CoV-2, researchers showed that immune cells called microglia are overactive in the brain. When microglia shift into high gear, they can damage surrounding brain tissue.</p>



<p>It turns out that microglia overactivity is similar to that caused by toxic chemotherapy treatments, says study coauthor Michelle Monje, a neurologist and researcher at Stanford University. “When the reports started coming out about the frequency of persistent cognitive symptoms associated with long COVID, I noted striking similarities between ’chemo-fog’ and ‘COVID-fog,’ and decided we needed to study this.”</p>



<p>Microglia were more active in the brains of mice infected with SARS-CoV-2 than in uninfected mice. A similar pattern emerged when the researchers studied postmortem brain tissue from nine people who died with COVID-19. It’s not clear how well these samples represent the majority of people who experienced mild COVID and are living with the aftereffects.</p>

<p>Infected mice also had higher levels of immune proteins in their cerebrospinal fluid. One in particular, called CCL11, has been tied to cognitive trouble in people that comes with age and in certain psychiatric conditions. People with lingering neurological symptoms of COVID also had more CCL11 in their plasma than people who didn’t have those symptoms, the researchers found.</p>



<p>The new results come with caveats, says neurologist Svetlana Blitshteyn of the University at Buffalo Jacobs School of Medicine and Biomedical Sciences in New York, who also directs the Dysautonomia Clinic. “They’re small studies, and obviously they are not definitive,” she says, “but the preliminary evidence speaks for itself.” It’s becoming clearer now that the brain fog that comes after an infection may be “rooted in neuroinflammation.”</p>



<p>Figuring out the cause of the neurological problems may reveal a treatment. Laboratory studies have pointed to potential therapies that can interrupt this immune system overreaction, particularly in brain inflammation caused by chemo, Monje says. She and colleagues are studying whether those same treatments might help with COVID-19.</p>



<p>Tragic as the pandemic is, it may ultimately lead to something good, adds Nath, who is setting up a small clinical trial to study possible long COVID treatments. All these other syndromes such as ME/CSF that researchers have struggled to understand “might benefit from what we learn here from long COVID. We might be able to develop treatments for them all.”</p>

                <p><strong>Note:</strong> PLOS issued the following press release on February 1, 2022</p>



<p>The Public Library of Science (PLOS) today announced that <em>PLOS Climate </em>published its initial cohort of papers. The journal&rsquo;s mission is to disseminate rigorous science that empowers researchers, policymakers, governments, international organizations, and industry to understand dynamic, changing climates and take positive, evidence-based action in the face of climate change. The journal has so far received more than 85 submissions from researchers around the world.</p>



<p>&ldquo;This is such an opportune moment to be launching PLOS Climate &ndash; at a time where, more than ever, robust science must provide the basis for decision-making in one of the most critical challenges facing the planet,&rdquo; said Emma Archer, Editor-in-Chief, <em>PLOS Climate</em>. &ldquo;We hope to be a platform for communicating that science, with a strong emphasis on opportunities for early career researchers in addition to established researchers, as well as those from groups and countries traditionally underrepresented in this field.&rdquo;</p>



<p>&ldquo;We seek to amplify the voices of climate experts around the globe to highlight knowledge from diverse regions and foster collaboration that accelerates progress at a global scale,&rdquo; said Jamie Males, Executive Editor, <em>PLOS Climate</em>. &ldquo;The broad scope of our journal will provide multi-disciplinary perspectives that help decision-makers develop holistic strategies to address the causes and effects of climate change on every level.&rdquo;</p>



<p>PLOS announced the launch of<a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2021/04/launching-new-journals-2021/"> </a><a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2021/04/launching-new-journals-2021/">five new journals last year</a> and <em>PLOS</em><em> Climate</em> is the third of these journals with papers ready for publication. All PLOS journals are underpinned by institutional business models that move beyond the article processing charge (APC) to ensure more equitable and regionally appropriate ways to support Open Access publishing. <em>PLOS Climate</em> utilizes our <a href="https://plos.org/resources/global-equity-model/">Global Equity Model</a>. PLOS&rsquo; existing fee-assistance program also supports authors who are unable to pay any portion of their publication fees.</p>



<p>The Editorial Board represents the full diversity of the research and researchers in the field. It is comprised of more than 120 editors representing more than 35 countries, including 22 Section Editors from 16 countries, and reflects PLOS&rsquo; commitments towards building diverse, equitable and inclusive editorial boards.</p>



<p>Here are links to four papers that <em>PLOS Climate</em> just published, as well as three opinion pieces:</p>

                <p>Yesterday’s scorching ocean extremes are today’s new normal. A new analysis of surface ocean temperatures over the past 150 years reveals that in 2019, <a href="https://journals.plos.org/climate/article?id=10.1371/journal.pclm.0000007">57 percent of the ocean’s surface</a> experienced temperatures rarely seen a century ago, researchers report February 1 in <em>PLOS Climate</em>.</p>



<p>To provide context for the frequency and duration of modern extreme heat events, marine ecologists Kisei Tanaka, now at the National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration in Honolulu, and Kyle Van Houtan, now at the Loggerhead Marinelife Center in Juno Beach, Fla., analyzed monthly sea-surface temperatures from 1870 through 2019, mapping where and when extreme heat events occurred decade to decade.</p>



<p>Looking at monthly extremes rather than annual averages revealed new benchmarks in how the ocean is changing. More and more patches of water hit extreme temperatures over time, the team found. Then, in 2014, the entire ocean hit the “point of no return,” Van Houtan says. Beginning that year, at least half of the ocean’s surface waters saw temperatures hotter than the most extreme events from 1870 to 1919.</p>

<p>A new analysis of monthly sea surface temperatures across the global ocean reveals how more and more patches of ocean saw heat extremes every year. These four decadal snapshots show temperature shifts since 1980. Beginning in 2014, more than half of the ocean began to reach extremes hotter than even the most extreme events from 1870 to 1919. </p>

<p>Marine heat waves are defined as at least five days of unusually high temperatures for a patch of ocean. Heat waves wreak havoc on ocean ecosystems, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/massive-marine-heat-wave-blob-unprecedented-seabird-die-off">leading to seabird starvation</a>, coral bleaching, dying kelp forests, and migration of <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/animals-swim-thousands-kilometers-escape-ocean-heat-waves">fish, whales and turtles in search of cooler waters</a> (<em>SN: 1/15/20; SN: 8/10/20</em>).</p>



<p>In May 2020, NOAA announced that it was <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/climate-weather-normals-30-years-hottest-record-united-states">updating its “climate normals</a>” — what the agency uses to put daily weather events in historical context — from the average 1981–2010 values to the higher 1991–2020 averages (<em>SN: 5/26/21</em>).&nbsp;</p>



<p>This study emphasizes that ocean heat extremes are also now the norm, Van Houtan says. “Much of the public discussion now on climate change is about future events, and whether or not they might happen,” he says. “Extreme heat became common in our ocean in 2014. It’s a documented historical fact, not a future possibility.”</p>

                <p><strong>Note: </strong>The Irish Libray Consortium issued this press release on February 1, 2022</p>



<p>PLOS, the non-profit open access publisher, and IReL, the Irish library consortium, today announced a new three year open access agreement, which allows researchers at eight participating institutions to publish open access articles in PLOS journals.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This agreement is IReL&rsquo;s twentieth open access agreement and its first with a fully open access publisher.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The agreement, which runs from 1 February 2022 to 31 December 2024, will be available to eligible Irish authors of articles accepted for publication in the journals: PLOS Digital Health,&nbsp;</p>



<p>PLOS ONE, PLOS Computational Biology, PLOS Pathogens, PLOS Neglected Tropical Diseases and PLOS Genetics.&nbsp;</p>



<p>&ldquo;The Irish Library Consortium shares our commitment to building business models that will move researchers and journals toward a more equitable and barrier free form of publishing,&rdquo; said Sara Rouhi, Director of Strategic Partnerships for PLOS. &ldquo;We are excited to partner with them and together we hope to bring permanent change to scholarly publishing.&rdquo;</p>



<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s very exciting to have signed our first agreement with a fully open access publisher. Researchers in Irish universities have favoured publishing in PLOS journals for many years, so we&rsquo;re very happy to help them continue this without author-facing charges&rdquo; said Susan Reilly, IReL Director.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/earth-second-trojan-asteroid-orbit">Earth has a second known ‘Trojan asteroid’ that shares its orbit</a></h4>

              
                <p>A recently found space rock is schlepping along with Earth around the sun. This “Trojan asteroid” is only the second one discovered that belongs to our planet. And it’s probably a visitor.</p>



<p>Trojan asteroids, which are also found accompanying Mars, Jupiter and Neptune, hang out in two <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/nasa-lucy-first-mission-trojan-asteroids-launch-space">locations near a planet</a> where the gravitational pulls of that planet and the sun balance each other (<em>SN: 10/15/21</em>). Because of this balancing act, these locations are stable spots in space. In 2010, astronomers <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/atom-cosmos-22">discovered the first known Earth Trojan</a> — called 2010 TK7 — orbiting within one of these two regions, known as L4, tens of millions of kilometers from Earth and leading our planet around the sun (<em>SN: 8/2/11</em>).</p>



<p>Now, <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-022-27988-4">researchers have found another one</a>. Dubbed 2020 XL5, this roughly 1-kilometer-wide asteroid is also at L4, astronomer Toni Santana-Ros of the University of Barcelona and colleagues report February 1 in <em>Nature Communications</em>.</p>



<p>The space rock was first spotted in December 2020, and follow-up observations suggested that it might be at L4. To confirm this, Santana-Ros and colleagues observed the asteroid using ground-based telescopes in 2021. Measurements of its brightness let the researchers estimate the asteroid’s size — about three to four times as wide as 2010 TK7. They also scoured archival data and found the object in images dating to 2012.</p>



<p>“There is no doubt this is an Earth Trojan,” Santana-Ros says. That decade-worth of observations let the team calculate the rock’s orbit thousands of years into the future, confirming the asteroid’s nature. It will hang around at L4 for at least 4,000 years, the team predicts. 2010 TK7, for comparison, will stick around for some 10,000 years.</p>



<p>Now that scientists know of two just-visiting Earth Trojans, they can envision more. The fact that the team discovered a second object means that 2010 TK7 isn’t a rarity or loner, Santana-Ros says. “It might be part of a family or population.”</p>

                <p><em>By </em><a href="http://emilyoliviareynolds.com/">Emily Reynolds</a></p>



<p>We probably all like to think of ourselves as generous, giving people, ready to provide friends and even strangers with favours when they need help. If we’re honest, however, that probably isn’t always the case — in fact, we’re <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2021/10/18/the-maybe-favour-we-more-readily-commit-to-helping-a-stranger-if-we-might-not-have-to-follow-through/">more likely to agree</a> to a favour when we think we might not have to follow through at all.</p>



<p>A <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/19485506211063259">new study</a> in <em>Social Psychological and Personality Science</em> looks at another facet of favours — the most effective way of asking for them. The team finds that we don’t <em>expect</em> there to be much difference between asking for favours in text-based, video and face-to-face settings— but that in reality, asking for help face-to-face is far more likely to yield results.</p>



<span id="more-45235"></span>



<p>In the first study, participants were randomly assigned to one of five communication channels — face-to-face, video call, audio call, video message or audio message — and told they would be asking five friends for a favour through this channel. The favour, proofreading a half page piece of writing, was asked for using a specific script in order to maintain consistency across conditions. After reading the instructions, participants were asked to imagine asking for help from their friends, and in particular predict how many of them would agree to help. Finally, having left the lab, they actually asked their friends for the favour.</p>



<p>Face-to-face was significantly more effective than any other channel at successfully eliciting favours. But despite this, participants failed to recognise that face-to-face would be better than video messaging or video calling. And although they did realise that asking in-person would be more effective than via audio, they still underestimated the size of this difference.</p>



<p>The second study was similar to the first, but compared email requests to audio and video calls. Audio and video calls were significantly more effective at eliciting favours than email requests — but again, participants underestimated how much more effective requests via audio or video would be.</p>



<p>What the results don’t indicate is <em>why</em> “richer” channels like talking face-to-face — or via video call when that’s not an option — are so much more successful at eliciting favours. It could be because of awkwardness: it’s easier to say no via an email than to look someone in the eye and try to put them off. Or it may be because we relate to each other more in person and thus feel more connected, warm, and willing to help. Future research could explore these elements further.</p>



<p>We may be asking for help online or via the phone because of the convenience of non-face-to-face techniques. But, while sending an email or making a call is easier than actually going to see someone, in doing so we inadvertently disadvantage ourselves. Asking for important favours in person, therefore, may be worth the trip.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/wild-cereal-farming-spread-ancient-europe-grain">A taste for wild cereal sowed farming’s spread in ancient Europe</a></h4>

              
                <p>People living along southeastern Europe’s Danube River around 11,500 years ago never planted a crop but still laid the foundation for the rise of farming in that region some 3,000 years later, a new study finds.</p>



<p>Hunter-gatherers living in this part of Europe avidly gathered and ate wild cereal grains for several millennia before migrants from southwest Asia introduced the cultivation of domesticated cereals and other plants, say archaeologist Emanuela Cristiani of Sapienza University of Rome and her colleagues. A <a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/72976">well-established taste for wild cereals</a> among hunter-gatherers of the central Balkan Peninsula, near what’s now Turkey, smoothed the way for farming to take root in Europe, the scientists conclude January 21 in <em>eLife</em>.</p>



<p>Previous chemical studies of human bones from Balkan sites indicated that ancient hunter-gatherers had eaten a lot of animal protein, mainly fish. Plant remains have not preserved well at those sites, leaving uncertain any role for grains on the menu of people who lived there.</p>



<p>It’s now evident that Balkan hunter-gatherers “balanced their diet with plant foods and did so for millennia before the arrival of agriculture,” Cristiani says.</p>





<p>The new findings align with earlier evidence that <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/agricultures-roots-spread-east-iran">hunter-gatherers in southwest Asia gradually domesticated wild plant species</a> from around 11,700 to 9,800 years ago, rather than rapidly adopting a farming lifestyle (<em>SN: 7/4/13</em>). But in the Balkans, hunter-gatherers consumed wild cereal species unrelated to domesticated strains later brought from southwest Asia, Cristiani’s team says.</p>



<p>Until now, the only site outside southwest Asia to yield evidence of hunter-gatherers collecting edible wild plants before the introduction of farming was a cave in Greece.</p>



<p>Cristiani’s group looked for microscopic signs of plant eating on the teeth of 60 individuals previously excavated at five sites in Serbia and Romania. Those sites range in age from several thousand years before the introduction of farming to several hundred years after cultivation began.</p>



<p>Food particles extracted from crusty deposits on the teeth of ancient hunter-gatherers contained starch granules and cell structures typical of regional wild cereal species. Starch granules from the same wild cereals were identified on the grinding surfaces of 17 stone implements, dating to as early as around 8,600 years ago, that were previously unearthed at one Balkan site. Hunter-gatherers at that location apparently pounded and ground wild cereals into a coarse flour, the researchers say.</p>



<p>Their findings provide the first direct evidence that southern European as well as southwestern Asian hunter-gatherers incorporated wild plants into their diets well before anyone cultivated crops, says archaeobotanist Elena Marinova of the State Office for Cultural Heritage Baden-Württemberg in Germany. For those ancient people, “the ‘paleolithic’ diet included starchy grains, not only meat and berries,” Marinova says.</p>

<hr />
<p>I am an applied microeconomist working in the fields of “global health” and “public health economics”. After serving the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) for nearly three years as a Prevention Effectiveness Fellow, I joined Augusta University as an Assistant Professor in the Institute of Public and Preventive Health. I primarily study the burden and determinants/risk-factors of noncommunicable diseases (NCDs) and NCD related healthcare management. The overarching goal of my research is to generate scientific evidence to facilitate strategizing policies and interventions for NCD prevention and control.</p>
<p>I have particular interest in studying the association between early life exposure to adverse events and later life health outcomes and risky health behaviors. As such, I study how events like child marriage (i.e., getting married before age 18 years) or adolescent pregnancy impact health outcomes during young adulthood and early middle age. Though many aspects of child marriage such as reproductive health outcomes and women’s empowerment have been widely studied, there is a dearth of evidence on the long-term health outcomes associated with the harmful practice of girl child marriage. In my research, I investigate whether <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/03630242.2021.2007198?journalCode=wwah20">child brides</a> and <a href="https://bmcpublichealth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12889-021-11488-z">adolescent mothers</a> at young adult age bear a different risk of having adverse health outcomes. The findings suggest that several chronic conditions such as hypertension, obesity, high blood pressure and high blood glucose comorbidity, etc. have strong association with child marriage and subsequent adolescent motherhood.</p>
<p><strong>Link to the SDGs</strong></p>
<p>This line of research is directly related to at least two UN SDG goals, namely Goals 3 and 5. One of the targets of SDG Goal 3 is to reduce premature mortality from non-communicable diseases (NCDs) by one third by 2030 through prevention and treatment (Target 3.4). My research identifies child brides and adolescent mothers as a vulnerable group with added risk of hypertension, which is a major risk factor of cardiovascular diseases (CVD) – the number one cause of premature deaths worldwide. Targeted interventions and tailored healthcare services, therefore, will improve cardiovascular health in this population and facilitate reducing premature NCD mortality. Given an estimated 650 million child brides currently living and having heightened risks of CVD, improving their health will have a substantial impact on attaining the Target 3.4.</p>
<p>Further, the findings imply that child marriage prevention will facilitate addressing the risk of downstream chronic health outcomes in women. This is related to another SDG target of eliminating the harmful practice of child marriage (Target 5.3). Linking child marriage with risk of downstream chronic conditions thus, inform opportunities for coordinated public health interventions to end child marriage and reducing the burden of NCDs.</p>
<p><strong>Challenges and future direction</strong></p>
<p>This is apparently a new line of research with limited existing evidence. The challenge, therefore, appeared to be convincing the scientific community and general audience that the associations are real and have important public health implications. I often received review comments stating that the catastrophic consequences of child marriage are well established and there is no need to do studies like this that examine any specific health impact. In response, my colleagues and I persistently convey the message that effective management of chronic health conditions entails identifying and extending the reach of healthcare services to the population at risk. As such, child brides and adolescent mothers, who suffer from various forms of socioeconomic deprivations, need apt policy attention to mitigate the risk of adverse health outcomes in later life.</p>
<p>This research is in early phase and there is long way to go. My team is working on a series of papers that relate various health issues at adult age with child marriage and adolescent pregnancy. In short run, success of this research can be deemed as effective dissemination of the findings that girl child marriage is associated with adverse health outcomes over the life course, to appropriate audiences including mass media, policy makers and development practitioners. In long run, success would be designing and implementing orchestrated public health interventions to improve child bride’s health outcomes and to eventually eliminate the harmful practice of child marriage.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2022/01/preprints-by-the-numbers/">The state of preprints at PLOS</a></h4>

              
                <p>In the weeks since <a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2022/01/plos-and-medrxiv/">announcing our expanded partnership with medRxiv</a>, we&rsquo;ve received lots of thoughtful questions from our authors, editors, and the scientific community. In this post, we aim to answer some of them.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But first, a quick recap of the role preprints have played at PLOS. While PLOS journals have always welcomed submissions with associated preprints, it wasn&rsquo;t until 2016 that we formalized our support for preprints in journal policy and began <a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2016/10/the-best-of-both-worlds-preprints-and-journals/">accepting incoming direct transfers from bioRxiv</a>. In 2018, we expanded that partnership and made it a 2-way street, <a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2018/04/one-small-step-for-preprints-one-giant-step-forward-for-open-scientific-communications/">giving authors the option</a> to have their manuscripts forwarded to bioRxiv as part of the submission process at select PLOS journals. In 2019 came direct transfers <a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2019/08/medrxiv-to-plos-direct-preprint-transfers/">from medRxiv</a> to PLOS, and just this month, <a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2022/01/plos-and-medrxiv/">facilitated posting from PLOS to medRxiv</a>.</p>



<p>The rates at which researchers have taken advantage of these integrations demonstrate how highly PLOS authors value preprints as a tool for disseminating their work. Since 2016, we have received close to 3,000<a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2022/01/preprints-by-the-numbers/#asterisk">*</a> incoming direct transfers from bioRxiv and medRxiv for consideration at PLOS. Since May 2018, more than 6,000 (13%) authors submitting life science research to PLOS reported that they have already posted their manuscript as a preprint, with nearly 9,000 (19%) opting in to have their manuscript forwarded to bioRxiv at the point of submission.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Both author-posted and opt-in rates for preprints vary by journal, research area, and geographic region, and have shifted over the years. In some subject-specific journals (<em>Pathogens</em>, <em>Genetics</em>) for example, rates spiked in 2020 before declining slightly in 2021, possibly relating to strong preprint support during the initial phases of SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. Other journals with broader scope (<em>ONE</em>, <em>Biology</em>) show more gradual, consistent growth over time.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Now, on to your questions.</p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator">



<h2>Preprint questions &amp; answers</h2>



<h3 id="risk-to-public">Question: Could preprints potentially spread misinformation, or pose a potential risk to the public?</h3>



<p>As we all know, peer review and publication take time. Preprints let researchers share new work before and during the journal editorial process. Early sharing creates new opportunities for collaboration, while maximizing availability for vetting, feedback and review. But early sharing also poses potential risks: for example, the risk that readers may treat preprints uncritically, as proven fact, or that preprints may contain information that could be dangerous to the public. That&rsquo;s why <em>responsible </em>preprint posting is so important.</p>



<p>Responsible preprinting is a top priority for PLOS. Every preprint undergoes a thorough screening by bioRxiv, medRxiv, or PLOS editors. Basic checks include fit and appropriateness&mdash;for example: Does the preprint report research? Is it within scope for the server? Is it free from inflammatory or derogatory language? More complex checks by subject area experts look at potential concerns such as risk to public health, dual use research of concern (DURC), or risk of revealing patient identities.</p>



<p>The rigor of this screening process is demonstrable. Across PLOS on average 71%<a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2022/01/preprints-by-the-numbers/#asterisk">**</a> of the eligible manuscripts whose authors opted-in to have their manuscript forwarded to bioRxiv pass screening and go on to appear on the server.</p>



<p></p>



<h3 id="citations">Question: How does posting a preprint impact citations?</h3>



<p>Research suggests that early sharing via preprint is associated with<strong> increased attention and citations for the corresponding peer-reviewed publication</strong>. In one study, following a cohort of over 74,000 articles published from 2015 to 2018, articles with preprints enjoyed 49% higher Altmetric scores and 36% higher citations than those without (<a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/52646">Yu &amp; Hughey, 2019</a>). Another study, looking at bioRxiv preprints specifically, found that the articles with preprints had higher Altmetric and citation rates than articles in the same journals without associated preprints (<a href="https://direct.mit.edu/qss/article/1/2/618/96153/The-relationship-between-bioRxiv-preprints">Frazer, Momeni, Mayer &amp; Peters, 2020</a>).</p>



<p>Importantly, it&rsquo;s not yet clear whether this association is causal. There may be many factors at work. For example, perhaps authors who share preprints are also more likely to engage in other behaviors that are known to increase attention, like sharing open data or methods, presenting at conferences, or posting on social media. Maybe authors are likely to preprint their most promising work. Or, perhaps preprints aid in driving online traffic to published articles.</p>



<p>While the relationship between preprints and citations is interesting insofar as it demonstrates the quality and interest of the research being posted, the correlation between preprinting and citation rate is in some sense beside the point. The main aim of preprints is to increase the efficiency of research communication, and of the peer review process.</p>



<p></p>



<h3 id="publication">Question: What if preprints are never published in a journal, or are retracted after publication?</h3>



<p>There is no evidence that articles with preprints are less likely to be published, or more likely to be retracted from the journals in which they are published, compared with other articles. Indeed, at PLOS, we&rsquo;ve observed an equal or slightly higher acceptance rate for submitted manuscripts with an associated preprint. We aim to share detailed data in the future, after a more thorough analysis.&nbsp;</p>



<p></p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator">



<p>Many journals have embraced preprints, especially in response to the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. What makes PLOS&rsquo; preprint program notable is the workflow integration that we offer at scale. We treat preprint posting as a free author service by integrating it into the submission process with a single question. That ease and accessibility makes preprinting more practical for our authors, and helps to normalize the use of preprints in the communities that we serve.</p>

                <p><em>By</em> <a href="https://emmayoung.net/">Emma Young</a></p>



<p>For such a social species, we are <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2022/01/25/how-to-master-the-art-of-conversation-according-to-psychology/">surprisingly bad at judging conversations</a>. Now a new misapprehension can be added to the list: even after striking up a conversation with a stranger, we underestimate how much we’ll continue to enjoy it. There are potentially important implications, point out Michael Kardas at Northwestern University and colleagues: if we mistakenly avoid longer conversations, we could miss out not just on the chance to connect with someone, but even to gain a new friend.</p>



<span id="more-45229"></span>



<p>In the <em>Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, Interpersonal Relations and Group Processes</em>, the team <a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2022-16089-001">reports on five studies</a> involving a total of more than 1,000 participants and almost 1,000 spoken conversations, conducted face-to-face or via private video conferencing<em>. </em>In one study, the team asked pairs of strangers to chat face-to-face for a few minutes and rate their enjoyment of the conversation so far — and predict how much they’d enjoy further conversations with their partner. The researchers found that even though the participants enjoyed the initial conversation, they consistently underestimated how much they’d enjoy continuing to chat, with their actual enjoyment often remaining high in subsequent conversations. Their responses to a questionnaire suggested that this was because they didn’t appreciate how much they’d actually have to talk about. Or, as the researchers put it, “Conversation remained replete with material for longer than participants imagined.” Another study also found that people expected to become tired of conversing more quickly than they actually did.</p>



<p>The team did find an intervention that helped, however. Participants who were asked, after five minutes of chat, to think about and note down some topics for further conversations were less likely to underestimate their actual enjoyment of those sessions.</p>



<p>In the final study, the team found that when people got to choose the conversation duration that they thought they’d enjoy most, they were often wrong. Those who didn’t get to follow their preferred duration, but were instructed to keep talking to their partner for a full 25 minutes, reported greater enjoyment than those who’d been allowed to go for their own chosen shorter durations. The participants had been told that if they opted for a shorter chat, they’d have to then sit in silence, without other distractions, for the rest of the 25 minutes —&nbsp;something that other studies have found that many people really dislike. Those who chose short conversations apparently didn’t appreciate that further conversation would actually be better for their wellbeing.</p>



<p>Sometimes, we do have to make a choice in the real world between talking to a stranger and keeping to ourselves. Public transport is an obvious setting for this. Rarely do we have no alternative source of entertainment, however. Perhaps if those who’d said they preferred a short conversation had been given access to their phone after chatting, they would have enjoyed the 25 minutes more overall than those who had to keep talking.</p>



<p>It’s also worth noting that if the team did gather personality data, it wasn’t reported in this paper. Perhaps extraverts are better at judging their likely enjoyment of a longer conversation with a stranger. Perhaps introverts enjoy longer conversations less. However, some of the earlier work on conversation has found that <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2014/08/15/were-happier-when-we-chat-to-strangers-but-our-instinct-is-to-ignore-them/">talking to strangers makes not only extraverts but also introverts feel better</a>, so perhaps this isn’t the case. Only further research will tell.</p>



<p>For now, though, “The current findings mark one of the first attempts to unpack the time course of enjoyment in conversation,” the team writes. And while we tend to think that conversations with strangers will quickly grow dull, if, as these studies suggest, this isn’t the case, there are immediate practical lessons.</p>



<p>Still, not all the participants who expected to enjoy a conversation less and less were wrong. And earlier work has found that <a href="https://www.pnas.org/content/118/10/e2011809118">conversations rarely end when we’d like them to</a>. So if you’re thinking that you might take these new findings to heart, and throw yourself into longer conversations with strangers, but are worried about how to get out of them, if necessary, you might also bear in mind <a href="https://www.vox.com/science-and-health/22368306/social-awkwardness-conversations-adam-mastroianni">tips on how to cut a conversation short.</a></p>

                <p>The cells of adult frogs seem to remember how to regrow lost legs, and a new chemical kick starter helps them hop to it.</p>



<p>Scientists have <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/nail-generating-tissue-also-regrows-fingertips">been seeking ways to spur</a> the body to regrow limbs to help people that have undergone an amputation (<em>SN: 6/12/13</em>). Like adult humans, fully grown frogs have a limited ability to replace lost body parts. But a new treatment — a device that delivers a drug cocktail — <a href="http://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.abj2164">jump-starts and improves limb regeneration after amputation in frogs</a>, researchers report in the Jan. 26 <em>Science Advances</em>.</p>



<p>“The cells of the frog already know how to make frog legs,” having done so when the animal was a developing embryo, says Michael Levin, a developmental biologist at Tufts University in Medford, Mass. “Our goal is to figure out how to convince them to do it again.”</p>



<p>Levin’s team amputated the right back legs of 115 adult African clawed frogs (<em>Xenopus laevis</em>) at the knee. Roughly one-third of those frogs received “BioDomes,” silicone sleeves that cover the wound. To another third of the frogs, researchers attached BioDomes holding a silk-based gel that contained five chemicals, including a growth hormone, a nerve growth promoter and an anti-inflammatory substance. The BioDomes stayed on for 24 hours and then were removed from the frogs’ legs. The remaining third didn’t receive any treatments before being placed back in their tanks.</p>

<p>In animals that received the drug cocktail, “around the four-month mark, we started to see a slight difference in the leg shape,” says Nirosha Murugan, a cancer biologist now at Algoma University in Sault Ste. Marie, Canada. “With time, that bud … started to take shape into a whole leg.”</p>



<p>After 18 months, the frogs that received the chemicals had regrown the limbs and had nubs where toes would typically grow. The amputees kicked, stood and pushed off the walls of their tanks using their regrown legs, Levin says.</p>





<p>The BioDome itself promoted some regeneration: The stiffness and pressure it creates at the wound seem to lead to conditions that spur growth, Murugan says. But frogs that received the BioDome with drugs grew longer legs with thicker bones. They also had more blood vessels and nerves. And compared with the BioDome-only group, frogs that received the drug mix showed greater sensitivity to touch when their limbs were lightly prodded. Frogs in the control group grew spiky flaps — basically stumps with no function — at the wound site.</p>



<p>“It’s actually remarkable that just a single treatment on one day can cause all this change,” Murugan says.</p>

<h3>Lost legs</h3>



<p>Over 18 months, frogs grew new limbs after an amputation (site of the amputation marked with dashed lines, left column). One-third of the frogs didn’t receive any treatment and grew a spiky stump (one shown in top row). Another third received BioDome devices that covered the injury for 24 hours (middle row). The remaining frogs received the BioDome and a drug cocktail (bottom row). This group grew the longest limbs with the greatest bone density and more blood vessels and nerves. They also developed legs with a paddlelike shape (yellow arrow) with toelike buds (blue arrow), as opposed to the other groups that grew only spiky flaps (pink arrows).</p>

<p>This first attempt at using a chemical cocktail to coax limb regrowth is “a great start,” says John Barker, an orthopedic researcher who recently retired from Goethe University Frankfurt and was not part of the work. With this approach, he says, “there’s no end to what you could try.”</p>



<p>The team has moved on to similar work in mice, using the same cocktail and new ones. Levin’s research also points to <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/building-body-electric">electricity’s role in shaping the growth of body parts</a>, so the researchers are adding compounds to the cocktail that alter the electrical state of cells (<em>SN: 12/8/11</em>).</p>



<p>Someday, scientists want to be able to regrow human limbs and organs. As with the frogs’ legs, human bodies know how to make hands, for example, Barker says. Children under the age of 10 or so can even regrow lost fingertips. In health care, “this whole story of regeneration changes everything,” Barker says. “Instead of treating symptoms, you could literally cure a disease.” For instance, regenerated heart tissue could replace damaged tissue to improve heart function.</p>



<p>Limbs, however, are more complicated because several types of tissue must coordinate. And researchers lack fundamental information on how bodies form their parts.</p>



<p>“We don’t understand how collections of cells solve problems” to decide what to build and when to stop, Levin says. “Cracking regenerative medicine is going to require us to do much better about understanding that.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/animal-human-organ-transplants-pig-kidney-heart-history">Will animal-to-human organ transplants overcome their complicated history?</a></h4>

              
                <p>A 57-year-old Maryland man has now survived just over three weeks with the transplanted heart of a genetically engineered pig. His doctor has hailed the operation as a <a href="https://www.umms.org/ummc/news/2022/first-successful-transplant-of-porcine-heart-into-adult-human-heart">“breakthrough surgery”</a> that could help solve the organ shortage crisis. But from a scientific standpoint, it’s too early in the game to know how much it moves the ball.</p>



<p>The use of animal organs for humans is an idea with a <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/xeno-solution">long, dramatic and often disappointing history</a> (<em>SN: 11/4/95</em>). There’s an old saying about xenotransplantation, as the field is known, says Joe Leventhal, a surgeon who heads the kidney transplant program at Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine in Chicago. “It&#8217;s just around the corner. The problem is, it&#8217;s a very, very, very long corner.”</p>



<p>But a rash of new experiments, including three involving pig kidneys transplanted into people being kept temporarily alive on ventilators, has provided tantalizing evidence that achieving the decades-old ambition may finally be in reach.</p>



<p>The recent human operations come after an extensive effort to develop genetically altered pigs with organs that might avoid abrupt rejection, along with further refining of drugs that suppress the immune system and boost survival. That said, the Maryland heart operation was a Hail Mary rescue attempt and not part of a clinical trial — the kind of carefully designed study that is ultimately needed to show whether pig organs can function in humans, and do so safely.</p>





<p>One case can provide some valuable information about how the body responds to the organ, says Karen Maschke, a bioethics scholar at the Hastings Center in Garrison, N.Y., who is editor of <em>Ethics &amp; Human Research</em>. “You may find stuff that you didn&#8217;t expect to find,” she says.</p>



<p>But a single snapshot of data doesn’t have enough context to draw conclusions, especially when it involves a gravely ill patient and brand-new technology. Without a study comparing several carefully selected patients, it’s hard to know whether one individual’s experience is typical.</p>



<p>Yet the latest flurry of pig-to-human transplant experiments could help open the door to the kinds of clinical trials that researchers want. That’s the only way to significantly advance the science, says heart surgeon David Cooper of Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston, who has long researched the idea of xenotransplantation. “We&#8217;ll learn much more if we are doing clinical cases than if we are staying in the laboratory.”</p>



<h3>High on the hog</h3>



<p>If clinical trials ultimately prove successful, animals could help ease a critical shortage of donor organs. Of the more than <a href="https://optn.transplant.hrsa.gov/data/view-data-reports/national-data/">106,000 Americans waiting for a transplant</a>, around 90,000 need a kidney. Many will die before one is available.</p>



<p>Doctors have previously turned to animal organs in bold, headline-grabbing endeavors. Famed Houston heart surgeon Denton Cooley transplanted a sheep heart as a desperate move to save a dying man in the 1960s; the man’s body quickly rejected the organ.</p>



<p>One of the most high-profile tries at xenotransplantation occurred in 1984 when doctors at Loma Linda University Medical Center in California sewed a <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/baboon-human-transplant-draws-mixed-reviews">baboon heart into a 2-week-old baby</a> born with a fatal cardiac defect (<em>SN: 11/3/84</em>). Baby Fae, as she was known, lived for 21 days and her surgery left a wake of controversy. Some medical ethicists called the operation a <a href="https://jme.bmj.com/content/medethics/11/4/178.full.pdf">“beastly business”</a> that lacked moral clarity. Scientists “<a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/389254?resultClick=1">beat a hasty retreat back to the laboratory</a>,” according to a 1995 report in the <em>Journal of the American Medical Association</em>.</p>

<p>More recently, scientists have focused on pigs, largely because porcine organs are about the size of adult humans’, and the animals are already raised on an industrial scale. Still, the feasibility of the idea was thrown into doubt with the discovery in the 1980s that pig cells are coated with a type of sugar molecule, <a href="https://rupress.org/jem/article/160/5/1519/23465/A-unique-natural-human-IgG-antibody-with-anti">called alpha-gal</a>, that strongly triggers the human immune system.</p>



<p>The field also experienced a setback with the discovery in the 1990s that the swine genome contains <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nm0397-282">embedded viruses</a>, snippets of viral genetic code woven into pigs’ genetic instruction books. (It’s not just a pig trait; these kinds of viral genes <a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fimmu.2018.02039/full#B1">make up an estimated 8 percent</a> of the human genome too.) The viruses, called porcine endogenous retroviruses, don’t bother pigs but might cause problems after suddenly finding themselves in another species.</p>



<p>In the early 2000s, researchers reported the creation of <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.1078942">genetically modified pigs</a> lacking alpha-gal, making them theoretically more compatible with the human immune system than a hog straight from the farm. That announcement set off attempts to raise alpha-gal-free animals, most notably in the United States by Revivicor, a company owned by United Therapeutics, based in Blacksburg, Va. Then, in 2020, the possibility of pig-to-human transplants took a giant leap forward, when, for the first time, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration <a href="https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/fda-approves-first-its-kind-intentional-genomic-alteration-line-domestic-pigs-both-human-food">approved Revivicor pigs</a> for human use.</p>



<p>Xenotransplantation also got a boon from CRISPR/Cas9 gene-editing technology and its remarkable ability to snip genes at will. Using CRISPR, scientists can <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/gene-editing-creates-virus-free-piglets">trim the unwanted viral genes from pigs</a> (<em>SN: 8/10/17</em>). “Gene editing with CRISPR has just really helped accelerate the field in sort of a warp drive,” Leventhal says.</p>



<p>In recent experiments, pig kidneys and hearts have been successfully transplanted into baboons. Though the baboons died within days in early xenotransplantation attempts, researchers reported in 2018 that <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/baboons-survive-6-months-after-getting-pig-heart-transplant">transplanted pig hearts kept beating</a> in the chests of two baboons for about six months, a record at the time (<em>SN: 12/5/18</em>). Other similar experiments have replicated that <a href="https://www.jhltonline.org/article/S1053-2498(20)31556-4/fulltext">survival time</a>.</p>



<p>Then, in October 2021, scientists from NYU Langone Health in New York City made the jump to humans: In a test, they grafted a Revivicor kidney onto <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/xenotransplantation-pig-human-kidney-transplant">a person who was clinically brain-dead and watched the organ function for 54 hours</a>, presumably long enough to detect any signs of immediate rejection (<em>SN: 10/22/21</em>). Less than two months later, the same surgical team repeated the experiment. A <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/ajt.16930">third such transplant</a> from researchers at the University of Alabama at Birmingham, this time into the abdomen of a man kept temporarily alive by a ventilator following a motorcycle accident, was described January 20 in the <em>American Journal of Transplantation</em>.</p>



<p>None of the kidneys transplanted in people appeared to provoke immediate immune rejection, and the organs even began to produce urine, doctors reported. Given the overwhelming need for kidneys, and proof-of-concept renal tests already done, most experts predicted that the first modern patient to get a xenotransplant would need a kidney.</p>



<p>Then came the unexpected news of David Bennett.</p>



<h3>‘I want to live’</h3>



<p>Bennett was suffering from acute heart failure and did not qualify for the human heart transplant list. On New Year’s Eve, the FDA gave doctors from the University of Maryland Medical Center permission to transplant the pig heart through a <a href="https://www.fda.gov/news-events/public-health-focus/expanded-access">special protocol</a>, sometimes called compassionate use, that allows very sick people emergency access to experimental drugs or devices — either because the patient doesn’t qualify for any study of the drugs or because no study exists. Bennett’s new heart also came from a Revivicor pig.</p>



<p>In a statement issued by the hospital, Bennett said he consented to the experimental surgery because he was simply out of options. He was bedridden, and no hospital would offer him a heart transplant, at least in part because he had a history of not following medical advice. &#8220;It was either die or do this transplant,” he said. “I want to live.” The eight-hour operation was performed on January 7.</p>

<p>A little over three weeks later, Bennett is gaining strength, says Muhammad Mohiuddin, a surgeon who directs the cardiac xenotransplantation program at the hospital and who was part of the surgical team. Everyday accomplishments, like talking with the staff about football playoffs, are tiny victories.</p>



<p>“We are counting all these smaller wins and hope this heart will keep supporting him,” Mohiuddin says. The heart is strong enough that the doctors have had to dampen its power because it was too much for Bennett’s body, weakened from lying in bed for weeks. “We put a Ferrari engine in a 1960 car,” Mohiuddin says.</p>



<p>Still, Cooper, from Massachusetts General, said he was surprised when he learned that the first living pig-to-human transplant patient received a heart, not a kidney. “What are they going to do if this graft slowly begins to fail?” he asks. “There’s going to be a little bit of a problem.”</p>



<p>“I thought it would be the kidney first. Because if that fails — say you get rejection that you didn&#8217;t expect, or you get infection that you can&#8217;t manage — you can take the kidney out, stop all the immunosuppressive therapy and put the patient back on dialysis.” A heart transplant is not so reversible.</p>



<p>Cooper and surgeon Hidetaka Hara, who were at the University of Alabama at Birmingham together, had suggested that the <a href="https://www.thelancet.com/action/showPdf?pii=S2352-3964%2821%2900355-8">first xenotransplant should be a step-by-step clinical trial with four patients waiting for a kidney</a>. The trial would work like this: Three months after the first patient receives a transplant, perform the operation in a second patient if the first person isn’t having complications. If those two are doing well, transplant a third pig kidney three months later, and a fourth three months after that, the pair laid out in September in <em>EBioMedicine</em>. “So over the course of a year,” Cooper says, “you’ve followed up four patients and you can see whether are they all doing well or are there complications.”</p>



<p>Starting a clinical trial with kidneys also makes sense, Cooper says, because the need is so much greater. Around <a href="https://www.organdonor.gov/learn/organ-donation-statistics/detailed-description#fig1">83 percent of the transplant</a> waiting list are people who need kidneys; 3 percent need a heart.</p>



<p>That’s why eGenesis, a company in Cambridge, Mass., is focusing its research efforts on kidneys. “It’s where the dominant need is,” says Mike Curtis, the company’s president of research and development. eGenesis, which is raising gene-edited, immune-compatible pigs, hopes to begin a clinical trial of six to 10 patients with transplanted pig kidneys around 2024.</p>



<p>Mohiuddin says that the reason he performed a heart operation is simple: He’s a cardiac surgeon, and the patient was dying. “My 30-year interest has been only in hearts,” he says. His research team has approached the FDA for permission to do a clinical trial, he says, but the agency wants more consistent data from baboon studies first. “We hope to get that permission,” he says. “This was just to save Mr. Bennett’s life.”</p>



<h3>One and not done</h3>



<p>Should Bennett check out of the hospital and go home, that high-profile milestone could serve a purpose beyond allowing him more time with his family: It could help persuade the FDA to green-light a larger, scientifically designed trial, Cooper says.</p>



<p>If Bennett continues doing well, doctors “may be able to get a handful of [heart] patients done over the next few months. And then they go back to the FDA and say, look, these patients generally did well. Now can we do a proper series, where we take patients on our own waiting list and do the transplants?”</p>



<p>Leventhal, the surgeon from Northwestern, has the same hope about approved clinical trials. “The only way that you&#8217;re going to see whether these organs provide meaningful function over the long term in humans, in a way that would justify their use, is to transplant them into humans and follow them longer-term.”</p>



<p>Still, it remains to be seen whether that will occur under compassionate use, as Bennett received, or in formal studies. The FDA’s expanded access provision was designed to help people obtain drugs and procedures that they couldn’t normally get. “Whether it should have been used in the case of an organ is an interesting ethical and regulatory and policy question,” Maschke, the bioethicist, says.</p>



<p>“One of the problems with going the route they did is that there are probably hundreds of heart patients in the country who are not on a waiting list because they’re too sick,” Maschke says. “Some of those folks may say, ‘I&#8217;ll never take an animal organ,’ but some of them might say, ‘Yes, I would take a pig heart. I want to do this too. Can you get me access?’”</p>

<h4>Waiting game</h4>



<p>In the United States, the large majority of people on the transplant waiting list need kidneys. Kidney transplants are also the most common type of transplant performed.</p>

<p>But opening the floodgates could make it harder to find volunteers for clinical studies. And in some cases, it could backfire. That’s what happened in the 1990s when doctors started offering women with advanced breast cancer massive doses of chemotherapy followed by bone marrow transplantation to restore their collapsed immune systems. Thousands of women received the experimental treatment — so many that scientists had trouble recruiting for studies. And when the scientific trials were finally done, the treatment showed no benefit.</p>



<p>That’s why there’s often a concern about moving too fast, “because you don&#8217;t want to derail the science — and the science is incremental,” Maschke says.</p>



<p>For now, pig-to-human transplantation has logistical issues that will help restrict its use. For one, the painstakingly engineered pigs are hard to come by. In addition to their rare genetic pedigree, they must be raised in sterile environments so they don’t pick up any microbes that might be transferred to humans. Another possible hurdle: Animal rights groups have decried the idea of pigs as spare parts for humans as “cruel and dangerous,” a sentiment that society will need to square with the urgent medical need.</p>



<p>But first, doctors need to know if xenotransplantation is even possible, or will once again end in failure. “What we don&#8217;t know is, how long and how well will these organs work in patients?” Leventhal says. “The only way we&#8217;re going to assess that is through transplanting them.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/top-10-science-anniversaries-2022">Here are the Top 10 science anniversaries of 2022</a></h4>

              
                <p>Even though it’s only even odds that 2022 will turn out to be less of a disaster than 2021 (or 2020), at least 2022 is the best recent year for compiling a Top 10 list of science anniversaries.</p>



<p>Curiously, many of those anniversaries are of deaths: the astronomer William Herschel for instance, who died in 1822; Hermann Rorschach, Alexander Graham Bell and the mathematician Sophie Bryant (all in 1922); and Louis Leakey (1972).</p>



<p>But there are also some notable firsts (the original slide rule, for instance) and births, including the scientist who illuminated how science could save society from devastating infectious diseases. Honorable mentions go to the birthdays of physicists Rudolf Clausius (200th), Leon Lederman (100th) and C.N. Yang (100th). They just missed edging out the oldest anniversary, a death from an earlier millennium:</p>



<h4>10. Al-Nayrīzī, 1,100th anniversary of death</h4>





<p>Abū’l-‘Abbās al-Faḍl ibn Ḥātim al-Nayrīzī was a <a href="https://www.encyclopedia.com/science/dictionaries-thesauruses-pictures-and-press-releases/al-nayriz">Persian mathematician and astronomer</a>, probably born around A.D. 865 in the town of Nayriz (in present-day Iran), which is why he became known as al-Nayrīzī. He died in 922 or thereabouts (close enough for Top 10 purposes). He got a job in Baghdad with the caliph al-Mu‘taḍid, writing treatises on math and weather, among other topics.</p>



<p>Unfortunately, many of al-Nayrīzī’s writings were long ago lost. But other writers mention his works and report that he was a master of astronomy and geometry. Among his surviving works is a translation and commentary on Euclid’s <em>Elements</em>. Al-Nayrīzī also attempted a proof of Euclid’s famous postulate about parallel lines never meeting. One of Al-Nayrīzī’s treatises for the caliph discussed how to determine the distance to upright objects. Had golf been invented yet, the caliph would have used such knowledge to calculate the distance to the flagstick without need of a GPS app.</p>



<h4>9. Invention of mathematical weather forecasting, 100th anniversary</h4>



<p><a href="https://www.encyclopedia.com/people/social-sciences-and-law/sociology-biographies/lewis-fry-richardson">Lewis Fry Richardson</a>, a mathematician who later turned to psychology, worked early in his career at England’s National Peat Industries. He was given the task of calculating optimal designs of drainage systems for peat moss subjected to different amounts of rain. He worked out the equations and then realized they could be applied to other problems, such as predicting the weather.</p>



<p>In the years leading up to World War I, he worked on a book, to be titled <em>Weather Prediction by Numerical Process</em>. He showed how values for temperature, humidity, air pressure and other weather data from one day could be processed by his equations to make a forecast for the next day. He took a break to be an ambulance driver during the war and then finished his book, published in 1922.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/sn-magazine/august-19-1922">As <em>Science News-Letter</em> reported that year</a>, one U.S. Weather Bureau scientist believed the book to show “that meteorology has become an exact science.” Unfortunately, to make the next day’s forecast from one day’s data took Richardson six weeks of calculation time. Only decades later did modern electronic computers make the mathematics of weather forecasting practical, and sometimes useful.</p>





<h4>8. Invention of slide rule, 400th anniversary</h4>



<p><a></a><a href="https://www.encyclopedia.com/people/history/historians-miscellaneous-biographies/william-oughtred">William Oughtred</a>, born in England in 1575, became a priest and part-time mathematician and tutor. In 1631 he wrote a book summarizing arithmetic and algebra, which became widely popular, later earning lavish praise from Isaac Newton.</p>



<p>Nine years before his book, Oughtred had designed the first slide rule. In 1614 John Napier had invented logarithms, showing how multiplication could be accomplished by addition. Six years later the astronomer Edmund Gunter had the bright idea of marking numbers on a straightedge proportional to their logarithms. Multiplication could then be performed by using a compass (the caliper kind, not for finding north) to find the answer by measuring the distances between the numbers to be multiplied.</p>



<p>In 1622, Oughtred had the even brighter idea of placing two such rulers next to each other. Sliding one along the other to properly position the numbers of interest allowed him to read the product of a multiplication right off one of the rulers. Oughtred later designed a circular slide rule, but one of his students claimed to have had that idea first, initiating a nasty priority dispute.</p>



<p>Further advances in slide rule design, incorporating things like cubes and trigonometric functions, made slide rules the premier computing devices of the 19th and 20th centuries — UNTIL electronic calculators came along, sadly depriving slide rules the opportunity to make it to age 400. But some people alive today once used slide rules, and probably still have one in a box somewhere.</p>



<h4>7. Maria Goeppert Mayer, 50th anniversary of death</h4>



<p><a href="https://www.encyclopedia.com/people/science-and-technology/physics-biographies/maria-goeppert-mayer">Maria Goeppert</a> was born in what is now Poland in 1906. Encouraged by her father, a university professor, to pursue higher education, Maria chose mathematics. But in the mid-1920s her fascination with a newfangled idea called quantum mechanics induced her to shift to physics. After earning her Ph.D., she married a chemist (Joseph Mayer) and moved to the United States. She was allowed to teach classes where her husband was on the faculty (first at Johns Hopkins, later at Columbia and then Chicago) but not offered a job of her own. She was free to pursue research projects, though, often in collaboration with her husband or other scientists, and she produced important work on many topics at the interface of quantum physics and chemistry.</p>



<p>She was a master of the math needed to understand spectroscopy; her studies of the light emitted by the newly discovered transuranic elements in the 1940s showed that they belonged in a chemical family related to the rare-earth elements — an essential clue to the proper positioning of the transuranics in the periodic table. After World War II, she began studying nuclear physics and soon deduced the existence of a shell-like structure for the arrangement of nucleons (protons and neutrons) in the atomic nucleus. Her findings complemented similar work by Hans Jensen, with whom she later collaborated in writing a book on the nuclear shell model. Jensen and Goeppert Mayer shared <a href="https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/physics/1963/summary/">the 1963 Nobel in physics</a> for that work.</p>

<p>Her shell model research was aided by a suggestion from Enrico Fermi, the physicist famous for his work on the secret Manhattan Project to build the atomic bomb. That was only fair, as when Fermi disappeared from Columbia University in 1941 to work on the bomb, Goeppert Mayer was hurriedly recruited to teach his class. In 1960, Goeppert Mayer finally was awarded a full-time primetime job of her own at the University of California, San Diego, but shortly thereafter she suffered a stroke, limiting her ability to do research in the years before her death in 1972.</p>



<h4>6. Aage Bohr, 100th birthday</h4>



<p>Niels Bohr was awarded the Nobel Prize in physics in 1922, the same year as the birth of <a href="https://history.aip.org/phn/11707003.html">his son Aage</a>. Aage grew up surrounded by physicists (who came from around the world to study with his father) and so naturally became a physicist himself. During World War II, Aage accompanied his father to the United States to work on the Manhattan Project, afterwards returning to his native Denmark to earn his Ph.D. at the University of Copenhagen. During that time Aage turned his attention to a problem with the atomic nucleus.</p>



<p>His father’s theory that a nucleus behaves much like a drop of liquid had been applied successfully in explaining nuclear fission. But more recent work by Maria Goeppert Mayer (remember her?) showed that nuclei had an inner shell-like structure, suggesting ordered arrangements of individual particles, not collective, liquidlike behavior. Aage developed a new theoretical view, showing that his father’s view could be reconciled with Goeppert Mayer’s shell model. He then worked on experiments that corroborated it and shared <a href="https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/physics/1975/summary/">the 1975 physics Nobel</a> “for the discovery of the connection between collective motion and particle motion in atomic nuclei and the development of the theory of the structure of the atomic nucleus based on this connection.”</p>



<h4>5. Gregor Mendel, 200th birthday</h4>



<p>Born July 22, 1822 to a family of farmers in what is now the Czech Republic, <a href="https://www.encyclopedia.com/people/science-and-technology/genetics-and-genetic-engineering-biographies/gregor-johann-mendel">Johann Mendel</a> preferred &nbsp;higher education to farming, enrolling in a philosophy program properly complemented with math and physics. When the time came to return home and take charge of the family farm, he opted instead to enter a monastery (where he adopted the monastic name Gregor). He did not particularly enjoy his priestly duties, though, so he got a job as a teacher, which required him to enter the University of Vienna for advanced science education. There, in addition to more math and physics, he encountered botany. Later he returned to the monastery, where he applied his botanical skills to investigating patterns in the physical features of successive generations of pea plants.</p>



<p>In 1866 he published results implying the existence of “differentiating characters” (now known as genes) that combined in different ways when transmitted by parents to offspring. Apparently nobody very astute read his paper, not even Charles Darwin, who would have been intrigued by Mendel’s mention that his work was relevant to “the history of the evolution of organic forms.” Only at the dawn of the 20th century was Mendel’s work translated into English and then recognized for its importance to heredity, evolution and biology in general.</p>



<h4>4. Pioneer 10, 50th anniversary of launch</h4>



<p>Of all the robotic spacecraft launched from Earth into space, <a href="https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/missions/pioneer-10/in-depth/">Pioneer 10</a> was truly the pioneer. It was the first craft to fly beyond the orbit of Mars and the first to exceed the distance of the solar system’s outermost planet, Neptune. Launched March 2, 1972, Pioneer 10’s mission was to visit Jupiter to take some cool snapshots of the giant planet and a few of its moons. Pioneer’s escape velocity from Earth surpassed 51,000 kilometers per hour (about 32,000 miles per hour), at the time a solar system speed record for any flying machine or bird. After dodging asteroids (most of them anyway) on its journey, Pioneer 10 reached the solar system’s largest planet in late 1973, passing within 131,000 kilometers (about 81,000 miles) on December 4.</p>

<p>Pioneer continued transmitting signals back to Earth until 1997, when budget cuts forced NASA to stop listening except for an occasional check-in. The very last signal came on January 23, 2003, from 7.6 billion miles away. By now Pioneer 10 is roughly 12 billion miles away, headed in the direction of the star Aldebaran. It will arrive in a mere 2 million years or so. If any Aldebaranians encountering it can decipher the sketches of a man and woman and the map revealing the point of origin, perhaps they will refuel it and send it back.</p>



<h4>3. Insulin treats diabetes, 100th anniversary</h4>



<p>In a century of medical miracles, one of the earliest and most dramatic was the discovery of insulin for treating diabetes. Diabetes had been recognized as a serious disease in ancient times. By the 20th century, scientists suspected that the pancreas produced a substance that helped metabolize carbohydrates; a malfunctioning pancreas meant a person could not extract energy from carbohydrates in food, resulting in dangerously high blood sugar levels while depriving the body of needed energy. It was nearly always fatal in children, and adults diagnosed with diabetes could hope for only a few more years of life.</p>



<p>As <em>Science News-Letter</em> reported in 1922, diabetes <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/sn-magazine/october-28-1922">ranked “with cancer in fatality and incurability.”</a> But in that year, a young doctor reported success in treating diabetes with a substance secreted by the pancreas. That doctor, <a href="https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/medicine/1923/banting/biographical/">Frederick Banting</a>, had tried the idea with dogs the year before and gave the <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3714061/">first insulin injection to a human</a>, a 14-year-old boy, in January 1922. Banting originally used insulin purified from animals; in the decades since, researchers have engineered more sophisticated forms for human use. But even with the animal insulin, success was so dramatic that Banting and his lab director John Macleod were awarded the <a href="https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/medicine/1923/summary/">Nobel Prize in physiology or medicine in 1923</a>.</p>



<h4>2. <em>Science News</em>, 100th birthday</h4>



<p>In its first year of providing news of science to the world, the organization then known as Science Service transmitted a weekly package of mimeographed pages (labeled Science News Bulletin) to newspapers and other media around the country. But soon other groups (such as libraries) as well as individuals began to request the package, and so Science Service initiated a new strategy with issue No. 50. On March 13, 1922, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/sn-magazine/march-13-1922"><em>Science News-Letter</em> was born</a>, with a new masthead offering subscriptions for $5 per year, postpaid. Its first article: an account of a U.S. Department of Commerce report on the allocation of radio wavelengths. The report assured everybody that “widespread use of radio for the broadcasting of public information and other matters of general interest” would be forthcoming. In 1966 the magazine dropped “Letter” and became <em>Science News</em>, providing an excuse for another centennial celebration in 2066.</p>



<h4>1. Louis Pasteur, 200th birthday</h4>



<p>Born in France in December 1822, <a href="https://www.encyclopedia.com/people/science-and-technology/chemistry-biographies/louis-pasteur">Louis Pasteur</a> was not a precocious youth. His interests tended toward art, but later some inspiring lectures shifted his attention to chemistry, and he became one of the greatest chemists of all time. Also one of the greatest biologists. And although he received no medical education, he provided the foundation for modern medicine’s ability to fight disease.</p>

<p>Pasteur’s understanding of microorganisms led to the recognition of their capacity to damage human health. His tenacity in conducting rigorous experiments and his pugnacious public promotion of his findings established the germ theory of disease and encouraged new methods of hygiene. Time after time he was called on to devise solutions for perplexing problems facing various industries. He saved the silk industry. He showed how to prevent wine from going sour, and how to make milk safe to drink. He devised vaccines for various diseases, including one to cure rabies. No one person in history is more responsible than Pasteur for preserving human health and preventing unnecessary deaths. He is lucky he was born 200 years ago, though. If he were around today, he’d be getting death threats.</p>

                <p><em>By</em> <a href="https://twitter.com/mattbwarren">Matthew Warren</a></p>



<p>We often feel regret when we learn that an opportunity we rejected has turned out really well. Think about that investment you didn’t make that has now shot up in value, for example, or the person you never asked out who is now living a happily married life.</p>



<p>But what happens when we never find out the outcome of that potential, rejected opportunity? If we don’t know what could have been, then it might seem like we shouldn’t feel much regret. But according to a <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/09567976211032657">new series of studies</a> in <em>Psychological Science </em>by Daniel Feiler from Darmouth College and Johannes Müller-Trede from the University of Navarra, we sometimes feel <em>more </em>regret in these situations.</p>



<span id="more-45205"></span>



<p>Here’s the logic behind the team’s investigation. Say you have to make a decision where you are faced with many different options — ordering from a menu at a fancy restaurant, for instance. You whittle it down to two possibilities that look particularly appetising, the salmon and the steak, before ultimately deciding to go for the steak. This is going to be one of the best meals of your life, you think, mouth watering as you see the waiter bring out the dish. But when you bite into the steak, it is merely OK, and nothing to write home about. You have overestimated how good it will be, and now you feel let down. If only you had gone for the salmon, you think…</p>



<p>But there’s a problem with this line of thinking: the salmon might have also been a disappointment. In fact, precisely <em>because </em>you were drawn to it so much, it’s quite possible that you overestimated its attractiveness, just as you did for the steak. However, because you didn’t order the salmon, you’ll continue to think it would have been amazing — and to feel regret.</p>



<p>The team’s work suggests that this idealisation of a rejected opportunity — and subsequent regret — is quite common. In the first study, 800 participants saw nine blurred faces (either men or women, depending on each participant’s preference), and had to choose their top two favourites. They then had to select which of these two would be the most attractive when unblurred.</p>



<p>All participants then saw their chosen face, now visible, alongside the rejected face. For half of the participants, this rejected face remained blurred, but for the other half it was made visible too. They all then rated how much regret they felt about rejecting this face, and rated the attractiveness of both the chosen and rejected face (or <em>predicted </em>attractiveness if the rejected face was still blurred).</p>



<p>The team found that when the rejected face remained blurred, participants were more likely to report feeling regret about their choice, and also expected the face to be more attractive compared to the actual attractiveness ratings given by participants for whom it was visible. In other words, participants who never found out what the rejected face looked like overestimated its attractiveness, and this seemed to lead to feelings of regret about not choosing it. However, participants who saw this face had a more realistic view of its attractiveness, and that tempered feelings of regret.</p>



<p>The researchers reported similar results using a different set-up. Participants pretended they were recruiting for a consulting firm, and were given 10 candidates, each of whom had been assigned scores based on an interview and test. They were told that these scores provided some indication of the candidate&#8217;s ability, but weren’t perfect, and could be a bit higher or lower than the their <em>true</em> ability.</p>



<p>Participants had to shortlist two candidates, and then decide which to hire. After making their choice, they were given a score representing their chosen candidate&#8217;s true ability. Half of the participants were also shown the rejected candidate’s true ability, while the other half were just shown this candidate’s interview and test scores again. Finally, all participants were asked how much regret they felt about passing on the rejected candidate.</p>



<p>The results showed that participants who never found out the rejected candidate’s true ability were more likely to report regret, and also reported a higher degree of regret, than those who did find out. A subsequent study suggested that this was again because they were overestimating the “attractiveness” of the rejected candidate — in this case, they thought that the candidate’s true ability was higher than it actually was.</p>



<p>This makes sense: the most attractive candidates would be those with high scores, but these would also tend to be people whose scores were overestimates of their true ability. Participants would be disappointed in finding out that their chosen candidate wasn’t as skilled as they thought, but might not realise that the same would likely be true of their rejected candidate.</p>



<p>Overall, then, it seems that regret might be quite a common experience when we don’t know exactly what would have happened if we had chosen a different path — particularly if we feel let down by the choice we <em>did </em>make. So in these situations is useful to bear in mind that we’ve probably overestimated how good that alternative path would have been. In fact, the authors suggest that “calibrating” our beliefs in this way could prevent regret from contributing to mood disorders — although further work is clearly needed.</p>

<p><strong>Marijuana commission finds usage high </strong>— <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/marijuana-commission-finds-usage-high"><em>Science News</em></a>, January 29, 1972</p>



<p>Approximately 24 million Americans have used marijuana at least one time. A national survey reports that more than 8 million are still using the drug.… Usage figures are 33 percent higher than the [National Commission on Marijuana and Drug Abuse] had expected, but … after age 25 pot smoking falls off rapidly.</p>



<h4>Update </h4>



<p>Americans’ interest in marijuana has grown over the last 50 years. Since 1972, the number of people age 12 and older in the United States who, in their lifetimes, have inhaled or ingested the drug has increased more than fivefold, to <a href="https://www.samhsa.gov/data/sites/default/files/reports/rpt35323/NSDUHDetailedTabs2020/NSDUHDetailedTabs2020/NSDUHDetTabsSect1pe2020.htm">126.5 million as of 2020</a>, according to the National Survey on Drug Use and Health. The gain in users happened as the <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/legalization-trend-forces-review-marijuanas-dangers">perceived danger of marijuana</a> dropped over time (<em>SN: 6/14/14, p. 16</em>). And unlike in the 1970s, older adults are getting in on the action, though prevalence has risen among adults of all ages. Of the 49.6 million people who reported using pot in 2020, about 47 percent were ages 26 to 49, and about 24 percent were 50 or older.<br></p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/materials-science-history-modern-daily-life-environment">Materials of the last century shaped modern life, but at a price</a></h4>

              
                <p class="has-drop-cap" style="font-size:20px">A 1920s science headline, “Ice cream from crude oil,” may best capture the era’s unbridled enthusiasm for chemistry. “Edible fats, the same as those in vegetable and animal foods … and equally nutritious … <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/ice-cream-crude-oil">can be obtained by breaking up the molecules of mineral oil and rearranging the atoms</a>,” exclaimed <em>Science News Letter</em>, the predecessor to <em>Science News</em>, in 1926. Synthetic ice cream was just one of the wonders that could lie around the corner.</p>



<p>Petroleum would become increasingly valuable, the article continued, “as a source of substances for which man has hither-to been dependent upon the chance bounty of nature.” A rash of potential products included aromatics, flavorings, nitroglycerin for dynamite, plastics, drugs and more.</p>



<p>Petroleum-based ice creams never became the new big thing, yet the last century has witnessed a dramatic leap in humans’ ability to synthesize matter. From our homes and cities to our electronics and clothing, much of what we interact with every day is made possible through the manipulation, recombination and reimagination of the basic substances nature has provided.</p>

<p>“The world is unrecognizable from 100 years ago,” says Anna Ploszajski, a materials scientist and author of the 2021 book <em>Handmade: A Scientist’s Search for Meaning Through Making</em>. And that, she says, is “simply because of the materials that we have around, let alone all of the new ways we use them.”</p>



<p>At the turn of the 20th century, organic chemists learned how to turn coal into a variety of industrial chemicals, including dyes and perfumes. Later, motivated by wartime demand, chemists honed their craft with poison gas, explosives and propellants, as well as disinfectants and antiseptics. As a result, World War I was often called “the chemist’s war.” And at a fundamental level, the new century also ushered in greater understanding of chemical bonds and <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/century/atom-matter-neutron-nuclear-power-fusion">the atom, its constituents and its behavior</a>.</p>



<p>In the decades that followed, approaches in chemistry and physics combined with engineering to give rise to a new field, now called materials science. An extensive survey of the field, put together by the National Academy of Sciences in the 1970s and titled <a href="https://authors.library.caltech.edu/5456/1/hrst.mit.edu/hrs/materials/public/MaterialsAndMansNeeds/index.html">“Materials and Man’s Needs</a>,” described the pace of research: “The transitions from, say, stone to bronze and from bronze to iron were revolutionary in impact, but they were relatively slow in terms of the time scale. The changes in materials innovation and application within the last half century occur in a time span which is revolutionary rather than evolutionary.”</p>



<p>Alongside this new science came new and improved scientific tools. Scientists can now see materials at a much finer scale, with the<a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/magnetic-objective-electron-microscope"> electron microscope</a> making individual atoms visible. <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/x-ray-microscope-invented-nobelist-w-l-bragg">X-ray crystallography</a> unveils atomic arrangements, allowing for a better understanding of materials’ structure. With equipment such as chromatographs and mass spectrometers, today’s scientists can untangle mixtures of chemicals and identify the compounds within. Francis Aston first took advantage of a mass spectrometer in his study of isotopes in 1919, but for a long time the tool was seen by some chemists as, <a href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/pdf/10.1021/ac8013065">according to a description by mass spectrometrist Michael Grayson</a>, “an unexplainable, voodoo, black magic kind of a tool.”</p>



<p>Many new materials were birthed from basic curiosity and serendipity. But new techniques also made way for targeted innovation. Today, materials can be designed from scratch to solve specific problems. And explorations of the properties of solid substances — for instance, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/new-theories-physics-enter-practical-field">how matter interacts with heat, light, electricity or magnetism</a> — along with iterations of design have further contributed to the stuff that surrounds us, giving way to transistors, eyeglass lenses that darken in sunlight, touch screens and hard disk drives. Explorations into how matter interacts with biological tissues have yielded coronary stents, artificial skin and hip replacements that include metal mélanges that are tough and nonreactive when they sit against bone.</p>



<p>The outputs of such efforts are all around us. Take air travel, and the global interconnectivity it introduced. It’s possible thanks to alloys that are lightweight and robust. And today’s personal connectivity — via smartphones and computers — came with transistors made of silicon. Their small size and low power requirements brought computing to our office desks, and then into our homes and pockets. An abundance of plastic housewares and comfy athleisure clothing options are made possible via improvements in polymers.</p>



<p>Yet innovation hasn’t come without consequences. For each tale of progress, there are stories of the marks people have left on this planet. While enabling humans to flourish, many new substances have become pollutants, from PCBs to plastics. However people go about addressing these environmental problems, other new materials will likely be part of the solutions.</p>





<h4>Going places</h4>



<p>It was the summer of 1940, the early days of the Battle of Britain. Nazi Germany’s air force, the Luftwaffe, began a months-long attack on the British Isles that eventually included the nightly bombing raids known as the Blitz. Going into the battle, the Luftwaffe believed it had the upper hand; in battles in France, the Germans had dominated in the air. Little did they know the Allies had a secret weapon — in their fuel tanks.</p>



<p>As Germans began flying over England, they were surprised to find the tables had turned. The British Spitfires and Hurricanes that the Germans had outmaneuvered in France could now climb higher and fly faster thanks to fuel made with a <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/catalytic-cracking-process-considered-very-important">newly developed process called catalytic cracking</a>.</p>



<p>Catalysts boost chemical reactions by reducing the energy needed to get them going. French mechanical engineer Eugene Houdry had developed a catalytic process in the 1930s to make high-octane fuel, which can withstand higher compression and allows engines to deliver more power. Simply increasing the octane rating of aviation fuel from 87 to 100 gave the Allies a crucial edge.</p>

<p>Houdry wasn’t the first to attempt using catalysts to bust the big molecules of heavy fuels into smaller ones to improve performance. But as an avid road racer, he had a special interest in high-quality gasoline. He studied hundreds of catalysts until he landed on aluminum- and silicon-based materials that could do the busting more efficiently than an existing process that relied on heat. When he tested his gasoline in his Bugatti racer, he reached speeds of 90 miles per hour.</p>



<p>In the following decades, catalytic cracking and improvements to the process Houdry pioneered would contribute to the reign of automobiles. Catalytic cracking still produces much of the gas that cars guzzle today.</p>



<p>But all that driving soon took a toll on the environment. When the hydrocarbon molecules in gasoline burn, the engine exhaust contains small amounts of harmful gases: poisonous carbon monoxide, nitrogen oxide that can cause smog and acid rain, as well as unburned hydrocarbons. Los Angeles and other car-packed cities choked on smog in the 1940s and ’50s.</p>



<p>Houdry looked again to catalysts to deal with the pollution that internal combustion engines caused. He designed a catalytic converter.</p>



<p>“When first considered, the problem seems simple,” Houdry wrote in a 1954 patent application. “A great number of catalysts can be used for the reaction. By simply placing one of these catalysts in the exhaust line under controlled conditions, the exhaust fumes can be cleaned.” The catalysts, precious metals such as platinum or palladium, provide docking sites for the harmful gases to hang onto; there, reactions involving oxygen convert them to less harmful forms.</p>

<p>In the 1950s, Houdry outlined a series of reactions, materials and conditions necessary for a working catalytic converter. But he was ahead of his time. For years, the adoption of catalytic converters in automobiles was stymied by leaded gasoline, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/practical-problems-remain">which gummed up the catalysts’ surfaces</a>. Finally, with the passage of the Clean Air Act of 1970, which led to requirements for catalytic converters and lead-free fuel, the air in cities began to clear.</p>



<p>For air travel to serve the masses, a different dilemma needed solving: lightening the load. The earliest airplanes gained lift at the turn of the 20th century on wings of fabric and wood, but to really soar, airplanes needed light but strong materials. The first aircraft designed for passengers — the Ford Trimotor, nicknamed the Tin Goose — took to the air in 1926 with help from aluminum alloys.</p>



<p>Alloys have existed since ancient times. Bronze Age artisans combined copper with arsenic or tin in crucibles to make tools, jewelry and more. From there, advances coincided with the ability to melt metals at higher and higher temperatures, eventually leading to steel. Scientists since have studied how materials’ structures and properties — including desirable features like strength, bendability and resistance to corrosion — vary with composition, temperature and processing.</p>



<p>The fuselage of the Tin Goose contained a newly developed alloy named duralumin, a contraction of “Dürener” (for the company that originally made it) and “aluminum.”</p>



<p>In 1926, <em>Science News Letter</em> described the promise of materials such as <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/scientific-research-make-new-dirigibles-safer">duralumin for safer dirigibles</a>, which would carry large numbers of passengers into the air: “Of these sound materials, strong and light girders must be built. So light that a man can carry one of them in his hand and yet so strong that they will carry loads of thousands of pounds.”</p>



<p>Dirigibles and duralumin were just the beginning. The 20th century saw an explosion in the types of alloys and their applications, from stainless steel cutlery to the titanium alloys used in prostheses and pacemakers to crucial components of vehicles. Today’s jet engines are built of <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/alloys-beyond-superalloys">superalloys</a>, which can withstand infernal temperatures.</p>



<p>Plastics and composites have also helped planes shed weight. Composites combine materials with very different properties — such as glass and plastic — by suspending one in the other or sandwiching them together, for instance. Because they can be tuned to be light and strong, composites have made their way into parts all over planes, from the engine to the wings. Boeing’s 787 Dreamliner, which debuted in 2007, is made up of 50 percent composites by weight.</p>

<h4>Making connections</h4>



<p>For a testament to the power of materials to connect us, just look at an iPhone. “The iPhone contains about 75 elements from the periodic table — a huge proportion of all the atoms that we know about in the universe are in an iPhone,” says Ploszajski, the materials scientist.</p>



<p>Some of those are rare-earth elements, a set of 17 metallic elements mostly on the outskirts of the periodic table. Though they are difficult to mine and process, rare earths are sought after because they lend unusual magnetic, fluorescent and electrical properties to materials made from them. Neodymium, for example, mixed with other metals makes the strongest magnets known. These magnets make your cell phone vibrate and its speakers produce sound.</p>



<p>Despite the hazards associated with mining them, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/sparing-rare-earths">these elements show up in a lot of other 20th century applications too</a>. Rare earths are in color televisions, camera lenses, fiber-optic cables, nuclear reactors, nickel-metal hydride batteries, aircraft engines, PET scanners and much more.</p>

<p>A more familiar element — silicon — is the reason cell phones and laptops are available in such a widespread way.</p>



<p>As a semiconductor, silicon conducts electricity better than ceramics and glass do, but not as well as metals. This in-between status makes it possible to control how electrons zip around a semiconductor, a control that’s ideal for creating electrical switches for circuits in radios, televisions or computers. In the 1930s and ’40s, these and other electronic devices relied on <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/vacuum-tube-has-rival">bulky, breakable glass vacuum tubes</a> to control electric current flow. Decades of semiconductor research pointed to a more reliable, slimmer way.</p>



<p>The first semiconductor switch, dubbed the transistor, was made of germanium and invented at Bell Laboratories in 1947. But teams at Texas Instruments and Bell Labs were both eyeing silicon, which holds up under higher temperatures. Silicon is also less likely than germanium to leak current when a switch is off. Though the two teams independently developed silicon transistors, Texas Instruments’ Gordon Teal gets the credit as his announcement came first, in May 1954.</p>

<p>At a conference in Dayton, Ohio, toward the end of the day’s talks, Teal matter-of-factly revealed his company’s success. “Contrary to what my colleagues have told you about the bleak prospects for silicon transistors,” he said, “I happen to have a few of them here in my pocket.” His announcement, which followed other talks suggesting that the devices were years away, jolted the audience, which stampeded to the back of the room for copies of Teal’s talk, and out to the telephone booth to share the news.</p>



<p>Our attention-sucking phones are right in front of our faces. But out of sight are the fiber optics that relay messages around the world in a flash.</p>



<p>All the glass strung out in the world’s optical cables could tether Earth to Uranus and then some, stretching some 4 billion kilometers. These cables ferry messages across countries and continents and across the seafloor. Optical fiber “really has strung the world together in a new way,” says Ainissa Ramirez, a materials scientist and author of the 2020 book <em><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/favorite-top-science-books-2020">The Alchemy of Us</a> </em>(<em>SN: 4/25/20, p. 28</em>). Messages from across the Atlantic used to come by boat, she says, then came copper cables to relay telegraph dispatches in the 1840s. The first live telephone traffic sent through fiber-optic cables was in 1977 in Long Beach, Calif. Now e-mails from abroad arrive nearly instantaneously thanks to thin-as-hair optical fibers.</p>



<p>The list of materials that helped put oceans of information at our fingertips goes on and on. All of these developments, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/better-batteries-charge-forward">including today’s lithium-ion batteries and more</a>, led to today’s abundance of electronic devices (<em>SN: 1/21/17, p. 22</em>). But ever more improvements, and our constant urge to upgrade, creates a new problem: “How do we unmake this stuff and recycle those substances safely?” Ploszajski asks.</p>

<h4>A plethora of plastic</h4>



<p>In a quest to really grasp the omnipresence of plastics, Susan Freinkel, author of the 2011 book <em>Plastic: A Toxic Love Story</em>, pledged to go a day without touching any. Glimpsing her plastic toilet seat, Freinkel gave up the experiment mere moments after it began. Instead, she spent the day cataloging all the plastic stuff she encountered.</p>



<p>Plastics covered her body — in yoga pants, sneakers and eyeglasses. Plastic made up the entire interior of her minivan and parts of kitchen appliances. Plastic packaging protected her food, and after eating, she dumped her trash in a plastic bin. Even the walls around her contained plastics, from the paint to the synthetic insulation.</p>



<p>Today, we’re awash in plastics. Yet at the beginning of the 20th century, only a handful of plastics had made their way into homes.</p>



<p>The story of commercial plastics began in the 1860s, when John Wesley Hyatt, seeking a substitute for the ivory popularly used in billiard balls, landed on a material later called celluloid. At the heart of celluloid, however, was the natural substance cellulose.</p>



<p>The first fully synthetic plastic, Bakelite, arrived in 1907. It was a fluke discovery by Belgian-born chemist Leo Baekeland, who was seeking an alternative to the natural shellac that insulated electrical cables. Celluloid was a suitable substitute for ivory and tortoiseshell, but sleek, shiny Bakelite gleamed with modernity. It quickly made its way into a host of products, including the casings for radios, jewelry and telephones. A new era of innovating on nature’s materials, rather than merely mimicking them, was born, Freinkel writes.</p>



<p>Yet it wasn’t until the 1920s that researchers started to understand plastics’ chemical nature. Plastics are made of polymers, large molecules made of repeating units. At the time, what gave natural polymers like cellulose, shellac and rubber their properties remained unknown. So inventors seeking new human-made substitutes relied on trial and error to make something similar. Credit for changing all that goes to the German <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/nobelist-pioneered-chemistry-synthetics">organic chemist Hermann Staudinger</a>.</p>



<p>From experiments on natural rubber, Staudinger showed that large, heavy molecules could be formed by linking many smaller molecules into chains. As <em>Science News Letter</em> put it in 1953, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/nobelist-pioneered-chemistry-synthetics">when Staudinger was awarded the Nobel Prize in chemistry</a>: “The way the molecules regiment themselves determines the differences between springy rubber, hard plastic and tough fiber.” It might sound obvious today, but Staudinger’s finding was controversial. Chemists at the time thought that what we now call macromolecules were simply aggregates of smaller molecules.</p>

<p>Staudinger’s ideas gradually gained acceptance and formed a basis for new research on polymers. In the following decade, industrial chemists worked to figure out the chemical reactions needed to create new polymers, plastics among them. One early success story was nylon, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/castor-oil-coal-newest-silkworms-stockings">a carbon-based polymer patented in 1938 as a substitute for silk</a>. American women were introduced to nylon stockings in 1940. Within a year, nylons grabbed 30 percent of the hosiery market.</p>



<p>But it was World War II that drastically increased demand for plastics. The military turned to the new industry to make substitutes for strategic materials such as glass, brass or steel, Freinkel says. Nylon was needed for military uses, so women offered up their stockings to be recycled.</p>



<p>“Great piles of stockings retired after faithful and intimate service are awaiting resurrection — thousands of pounds of them,” <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/nylon-after-war">reported <em>Science News Letter</em> in 1943</a>.</p>



<p>Though small at the start of the war, the plastics industry got better at making its wares and boosted production. Processes such as injection molding, which spurts melted plastic into a mold “sort of like a Play-Doh Fun Factory,” Freinkel says, made it possible to mass-produce plastic. A technique called blow molding, invented in the 1930s and based on the same principle as glass blowing, offered a quick way to form plastic bottles.</p>



<p>As wartime demand dried up, the plastics industry began to bring its products to the people. “You start to get this flood of plastic into everyday life,” Freinkel says.</p>



<p>The promise of plastic was on display in 1946. Held in New York City, the first National Plastics Exhibition featured wares made of the wonder material. “Thousands of people lined up to go to this trade show and walk through this conference hall and gawk at stuff that had an almost magical quality,” Freinkel says. Visitors saw durable nylon fishing line and window screens in a riot of colors. Mass-produced plastic offered “a new way to have the good life on the cheap.”</p>



<p>We’ve come a long way from the days of celluloid and Bakelite. Tens of thousands of plastic compounds exist today. The world now produces in excess of 380 million metric tons of plastic a year — that’s more than a hundred pounds of what’s typically very lightweight stuff for every person on the planet every year.</p>

<h4>Consequences</h4>



<p>By the mid-1960s, researchers started noticing plastic pieces in the ocean, Freinkel says. Today, plastic pollution is found virtually everywhere, in bits <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/tiny-microplastics-travel-far-wind">wafting in the winds</a>, high in <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/plastics-remote-places-microplastics-earth-mount-everest">Mount Everest’s snow</a> and as <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/mirco-plastic-debris-accumulating-far-beneath-ocean-surface">trash piling up on the seafloor</a>.</p>



<p>Plastics are the quintessential example of the journey from material marvel to environmental nuisance. But they’re not the only problem.</p>



<p>The organic chemistry advances of the early 1900s made new and exciting materials possible, but also allowed people to make more and more materials that weren’t recyclable, says Thomas Le Roux, a historian at the French National Center for Scientific Research in Paris and co-author of the 2020 book <em>The Contamination of the Earth</em>. By the 1970s, new disposable products, from pens to razors to packaging, signaled an ease of life. “It was modern to throw away what we buy,” he says.</p>



<p>The consequences of this easy-come, easy-go relationship with our stuff soon appeared in the environment. Our unabated demand for fossil fuels, used not only as fuel but as raw materials for making plastics, releases emissions that contribute to Earth’s changing climate.</p>

<p>Many of our modern substances were created to solve problems, says Mark Jones, a chemist and member of the National Historic Chemical Landmarks committee of the American Chemical Society. For instance, before the 1930s, air conditioning and refrigeration relied on ammonia, which is flammable and toxic. That changed with the introduction of Freon and other chlorofluorocarbons, or CFCs for short, which were created by chemists in the 1920s. These molecules appeared to have little effect on living things. “They were presumed to be incredibly safe,” says Jones, who recently retired from Dow Chemical.</p>



<p>But Freon and its CFC cousins had <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/freon-destroying-ozone-layer">unforeseen consequences on the atmosphere</a> when they escaped air conditioning and refrigeration systems. In the 1980s, scientists discovered a hole in Earth’s ozone layer that forms when CFCs rise to the stratosphere, break down and react with ozone, destroying it. In solving one problem, humankind found itself with another.</p>

<h3>CFCs’ creation&nbsp;</h3>



<p>In 1985, scientists discovered a hole in the ozone layer, created by chlorofluorocarbons in the stratosphere. The Montreal Protocol turned things around: 2019 saw the smallest ozone hole ever recorded (compared below with 1987).</p>

<p>The history of science offers up abundant examples of solutions begetting new problems. Polychlorinated biphenyls, or PCBs, useful insulators in electronics, can cause serious health problems, including cancer, when they enter the environment. The compounds that allow food to slide out of kitchen pans without sticking belong to a family that has earned the title “forever chemicals” for the tendency not to degrade. <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/search-new-geologic-sources-lithium-could-power-clean-future">Lithium mining</a>, which has increased with demand for lithium-ion batteries, guzzles water and can release harmful chemicals that contaminate ecosystems and poison drinking wells. Other battery ingredients, such as cobalt, are mined unethically — sometimes using child labor.</p>



<p>Perhaps the largest unintended consequence that humankind faces today is climate change. Human activities — factories, mining, growing food, traveling, using air conditioning and heating to keep indoor climates comfortable — have released greenhouse gas emissions that have heated the world by around 1.25 degrees Celsius since preindustrial times. The world is already experiencing <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/climate-change-un-ipcc-report-humans">extreme weather events linked to climate change</a>.</p>



<div class="wp-block-sciencenews-content-sidebar alignright">

metric tons</h5><p style="text-align: center">Amount of plastic
produced per year</p>
</div>



<p>Clearly chemists and materials scientists have contributed to these problems. But they will inevitably be part of finding solutions as well. There’s a cyclical nature to the promise and perils of new molecules and materials. “The entire history of chemistry is, ‘Hey, look what I can do! Darn, I wish I hadn’t done it that way! But I have another way I can do it.’ And that keeps us kind of moving forward,” Jones says.</p>



<p>Chemists are now creating plastics that will <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/chemistry-recycling-plastic-landfills-trash-materials">break down after use and can be recycled more easily</a> (<em>SN: 1/30/21, p. 20</em>). Materials scientists are developing <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/engineering-clean-drinking-water-treatment-pollution">better membrane materials to filter pollutants</a> out of water (<em>SN: 11/24/18, p. 18</em>). Engineers are deploying new materials to capture carbon dioxide at smokestacks.</p>



<p>New iron-based catalysts could someday convert captured <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/new-iron-based-catalyst-converts-carbon-dioxide-into-jet-fuel">carbon dioxide into jet fuel</a>, potentially cutting greenhouse gas emissions from air travel (<em>SN: 1/30/21, p. 5</em>). And researchers continue to innovate to turn more and more of the <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/perovskites-power-solar-industry">solar spectrum into energy</a>, and so cut our reliance on fossil fuels (<em>SN: 8/5/17, p. 22</em>).</p>



<p>Chemistry and materials innovation can’t solve all our problems. People’s choices also matter. Weighing the risks and rewards that come with new materials will require recognition of the potential problems, regulations to combat them, willpower, collaboration and collective action. History holds plenty of lessons, but it’s not yet clear whether we’ll learn from them.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2022/01/plos-response-wissenschaftsrat-oa/">PLOS response to the Wissenschaftsrat (German Science Council) statement on Open Access</a></h4>

              
                <p>At PLOS we warmly welcome the January 24, 2022 <a href="https://www.wissenschaftsrat.de/download/2022/pm_0222.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">statement </a>from the German Science Council (Wissenschaftsrat) advocating that Open Access (OA), via a CC BY license, should become the default for scientific publications.</p>



<p>The statement observes that a move to Open Access entails a paradigm shift in the scientific publication system, moving the roles of publishers toward coordinators of peer review and providers of publishing services. Since our foundation in 2001, to date, PLOS has published <strong>297,968 articles</strong> across our journals under this Open Access CC BY model, and we have helped pioneer the sustainability of rigorous Open Access publishing. In addition, we also are <a href="https://plos.org/financial-overview/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">transparent about our finances</a> every year, and we have adopted the<a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2021/09/our-commitment-to-price-transparency/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> pricing transparency model </a>that has been developed by the funders of the <a href="https://www.coalition-s.org/">Plan S</a> project.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Therefore we support this statement that this shift is not just desirable, but entirely proven and sustainable, and able to be executed with the desired levels of transparency.</p>



<p>However, in addition to our support for this Open Access vision we would add several points to the statement to ensure it does not only focus on published Open Access Versions of Record, but also accommodates the developing Open Science ecosystem.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In our opinion, focusing on research article Versions of Record, and spending the following three years only focused on an OA financing system, risks further embedding them as the primary and sole unit of sharing research. In considering how to reorganize the financing system to support more openness and research integrity, we believe it will be important to look beyond OA and build in the potential to support policies and developments that will enable more efficient and transparent research-sharing, especially as that is something the Wissenschaftsrat additionally seeks.</p>



<p>As a publisher aligned with Wissenschaftsrat&rsquo;s vision, PLOS serves a much broader role than simply the provision of publishing services and a host of the Version of Record. The most well-known example is our Open Data policy: since 2014, all PLOS journals have <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/s/data-availability" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">required authors </a>to make all data necessary to replicate their study&rsquo;s findings publicly available without restriction at the time of publication (acknowledging standard exceptions for specific legal or ethical restrictions). And, since July 2014, to date, <strong>177,357 articles</strong> have been published with such Data Availability Statements. And, now, conversations about open data, reproducibility, and research integrity &ndash; a.k.a. Open Science &ndash; are all part of the mainstream conversation around research communication as they have been proven to be sustainable values and behaviors within that system.</p>



<p>Via this open data policy, but also <a href="https://plos.org/published-peer-review-history/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">open peer review options</a>, <a href="https://plos.org/protocols/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">protocols</a>, <a href="https://plos.org/open-science/open-methods/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">open methods</a>, <a href="https://plos.org/open-science/preregistration/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">preregistration</a>, <a href="https://plos.org/open-science/preprints/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">preprint facilitation</a>, and our <a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2021/09/announcing-a-new-plos-policy-on-inclusion-in-global-research/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">recent policy addressing inclusion in global research</a>, PLOS is working towards Open Science at a scale and in ways that increase the transparency and rigor of the entire research communication system, and not just our journals. In addition, we are working tirelessly to develop <a href="https://plos.org/resources/for-institutions/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">business models beyond Article Processing Charges</a> (APCs) so that both Open Access, and Open Science outputs and behaviors, are sustainable, equitable, and workable at a global scale.</p>



<p>In summary, this moment of the COVID-19 pandemic is not just a time to highlight the importance of Open Access, but also Open Science, and Open Science&rsquo;s focus on trust and inclusion in the system of research communication. Our Open Science vision aligns with that of the Wissenschaftsrat and needs the support of forward-thinking organizations like it. We would happily discuss how we can work together and help each other.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/gut-microbe-ground-squirrel-muscle-hibernation">Gut microbes help some squirrels stay strong during hibernation</a></h4>

              
                <p>Gut microbes give some squirrels a helping hand to stay strong during hibernation. The microorganisms appear to <a href="http://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.abh2950">help the squirrels recycle nutrients</a> to keep the rodents’ muscles taut, researchers report in the Jan. 28 <em>Science</em>.</p>



<p>Understanding how squirrels keep their muscle over the winter could offer a small clue to figuring out how to stave off muscle loss for people who are malnourished or have muscle-wasting diseases, the scientists say. &nbsp;</p>



<p>“After long bed rest, humans are just not jumping up and down and climbing mountains,” says study coauthor Hannah Carey, a hibernation physiologist at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. “But that’s what these [squirrels] have to do.” &nbsp;</p>



<p>Muscle breakdown from inactivity or starvation releases compounds made of nitrogen — a crucial element found in muscle building blocks called amino acids. Too much nitrogen can be toxic, so the body normally eliminates the excess through urine in a compound called urea.</p>





<p>Previous work has shown that arctic ground squirrels (<em>Urocitellus parryii</em>) can <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/arctic-squirrels-recycle-proteins-hibernation-survive-winter">recycle nitrogen for muscle preservation on their own</a>, without gut microbes’ help (<em>SN: 12/16/20</em>). In the new study, Carey and colleagues tracked where nitrogen went in the bodies of thirteen-lined ground squirrels (<em>Ictidomys tridecemlineatus</em>) using an isotope, a form of the element with a different mass, as a tracer. In hibernating squirrels, nitrogen that had been processed by microbes ended up in skeletal muscle. But animals treated with antibiotics to clear out gut-inhabiting bacteria incorporated less nitrogen into muscle, a sign that the microbes were responsible.</p>



<p>Some gut microbes salvage nitrogen from urea and use it to make amino acids. Hibernating squirrels can then use those amino acids to preserve muscle, the findings suggest.</p>



<p>It seems that to help the creatures stay strong, Carey says, microbes and squirrels come together.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/urban-animals-gut-microbe-humans">Urban animals may get some dangerous gut microbes from humans</a></h4>

              
                <p>Animals moving into the big city could be getting more than they bargained for. Gut microorganisms from humans in cities may be spilling over into urban wildlife, potentially putting the animals’ health at risk.</p>



<p>Fecal samples from humans and animals around the world show that urban critters harbor microbial communities that have <a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.01.05.475040v1">much more in common with those in urban humans</a> than in rural people and wildlife, researchers report in a preliminary study posted January 6 at bioRxiv.org. While previous research has found captive animals can acquire human microbes — some linked with gastrointestinal disorders, immune deficiencies and even stunted growth — this is the first time a humanizing effect on wildlife has been found in cities, and between humans and reptiles.</p>



<p>Many of the microbes that show up more often in industrialized human populations are appearing in urban wildlife populations, but they&#8217;re completely missing from the rural populations, says Andrew Moeller, an evolutionary biologist at Cornell University.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Many animals harbor symbiotic communities of microbes, products of evolutionary history that play <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/gut-microbes-elite-athletes-physical-performance-enhancement">an important role in immunity and fitness</a> (<em>SN: 6/24/19</em>). To see how the microbe communities in urban animals compared with those in humans, Moeller and his team analyzed 492 fecal samples taken from humans, coyotes and lizards in urban and rural locations as varied as Edmonton, Canada, and Amazonian villages in Venezuela. The team used genomic analysis to find the abundance of microbial DNA in each sample and then compared the microbial profiles between urban and rural hosts.</p>





<p>Urban lizards and coyotes had gut microbiome communities more similar to urban humans than rural humans or wildlife, the researchers found. Most notably, they discovered 18 lineages of bacteria in urban wildlife that did not appear in their rural counterparts.</p>



<p>The parallel changes in microorganisms seen in diverse animals from different locations are convincing patterns of urban-specific microbial changes, says Taichi Suzuki, an evolutionary biologist at the Max Planck Institute for Developmental Biology in Tübingen, Germany, who was not involved in the study. “A big question is the mechanism driving this pattern, which needs further investigation,” he says.</p>



<p>Research has found the human gut to be a source of the new bacteria lineages found in the urban wildlife, so they probably picked them up from people somehow, Moeller says. Humans shed bacteria from our <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/cloud-microbes-surrounds-person">personal microbial clouds</a>, as we go about daily life (<em>SN</em>: 9/30/15). “The simplest explanation would be that the animals are just cohabiting in that same space, and therefore picking up microbes in their environment,” says Moeller. It could also be a product of an urban gastronomical lifestyle, eating humans’ leftovers: some bacteria are associated with high-fat, high-protein diets typically eaten in cities.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>The research is a nice primer but could benefit from taking account of local diets and pathologies, says Mark van der Giezen, a microbiologist at the University of Stavanger in Norway also not involved with this study. “Urbanization is a social phenomenon of very complex nature,” he says.</p>

                <p><em>By&nbsp;</em><a href="http://emilyoliviareynolds.com/">Emily Reynolds</a></p>



<p>Moving house can have significant psychological effects — and not just because it’s stressful. Moving can <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2016/07/27/the-relocation-bump-how-moving-house-creates-lasting-memories/">create long-lasting memories</a>, good and bad, while moving <em>frequently</em> is associated with lower academic achievement and poorer physical and mental health among children.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It’s this second experience — moving frequently — that a <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/19485506211061017">new study</a>, published in <em>Social Psychological and Personality Science, </em>explores. Looking at &#8220;residential mobility&#8221; in the context of romantic relationships, the team finds that those who have moved away from their place of birth or who have frequently moved throughout their life are more likely to see their partners as central to their lives.</p>



<span id="more-45177"></span>



<p>Over three studies, the team explored three factors relating to how central to their life someone views a relationship: the extent to which a partner is a confidant, a source of a deep bond, and a source of wellbeing. In the first, the team gathered data from a life satisfaction survey, conducted in Turkey annually since 2003. Among other things, participants indicated whether or not they had lived in the same district since they were born, and who they preferred to confide in about work, money, and health — their spouse, their family, or their friends. And results showed that those who were more residentially mobile were more likely to prioritise their spouse as a confidant above their family or friends.</p>



<p>In the second study, participants in exclusive romantic relationships were recruited to explore their attachment to various figures in their social network. First, they reported how many times they had moved neighbourhood, city or country during their lifetime. They then listed people in their life who played different roles: those they speak to frequently, who they see as a &#8220;safe haven&#8221; and contact when they need help, those they see as a secure base who will always be there for them, and those they miss when they are not together. For each category, participants listed up to four people in order of significance.</p>



<p>Again, those who had moved frequently ascribed more importance to their romantic partners in all categories, again suggesting that residential mobility is associated with romantic relationships being more central to one’s life.</p>



<p>In a final study, participants again indicated how many times they had moved, before taking part in a number of other measures. First, they indicated how responsive they felt their partner was — whether they felt listened to and understood. Next, they rated how satisfied they were with their life on a scale from 1 to 7, and indicated how positive or negative they’d felt over the last six months. Finally, they completed a scale measuring &#8220;eudaimonic&#8221; wellbeing, or how much one feels that their life has meaning and purpose; this measured participants&#8217; feelings of autonomy, their capacity to manage their life, their level of personal growth, the feeling their life had purpose, and how much they accepted themselves.</p>



<p>The perceived responsiveness of romantic partners played a significant role in participants’ wellbeing, predicting both their life satisfaction and eudaimonic wellbeing. And for people who had moved more in their lives, eudaimonic wellbeing increased more dramatically as perceived partner responsiveness increased, suggesting that for these people, their relationship was again more central in their lives.</p>



<p>As to the mechanism behind these results, there are a number of suggestions. Firstly, moving around a lot limits one’s social network: if you don’t live in the place you grew up but your family does, then you may be less likely to rely on them. Moving may also allow you to develop a higher level of independence, fostering “relationships of choice” rather than obligatory kin relationships. And if you are a high-frequency mover, your social networks may be more shallow and casual than those of someone with deeper ties to a place — meaning your romantic relationship is likely to be the most intimate.</p>



<p>The team caution that their results demonstrate only correlation, not causation, and that further research should take place outside of Turkey. However, overall the results seem to suggest that there is an important relationship between how often we move and how central our partner is in our lives.</p>

                <p>There may be a reason we see a man, rather than a maiden, in the moon. When people spot facelike patterns in inanimate objects, those faces are <a href="https://www.pnas.org/cgi/doi/10.1073/pnas.2117413119">more likely to be perceived as male</a> than female, researchers report in the Feb. 1 <em>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences</em>.</p>



<p>In experiments with over 3,800 U.S. adults recruited online, participants reviewed about 250 photos of illusory faces — in objects from potatoes to suitcases — and labeled each one as male, female or neutral. Faces were deemed male about four times as often as they were female. Both male and female participants showed that bias, with about 80 percent of participants labeling more images male than female. Only 3 percent judged more to be female than male. The remaining 17 percent of respondents were fairly evenhanded in their labels.</p>



<p>In follow-up experiments, participants did not show the same bias toward images of the same kinds of objects without illusory faces. That finding helped rule out the possibility that participants viewed something about the underlying objects as masculine or feminine. Computer models that scoured the illusory face photos for stereotypically masculine or feminine elements — such as <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/faces-perception">more angular or curved features</a> (<em>SN: 6/29/01</em>) — couldn’t explain the bias, either.</p>

<p>“There’s this asymmetry in our perception,” says study author Susan Wardle, a cognitive neuroscientist at the National Institutes of Health in Bethesda, Md. Given the most basic pattern of a face, as is seen in illusory faces, “we’re more likely to see it as male, and it requires additional features to see it as female,” Wardle says. She points to the fact that female emojis and Lego characters are often distinguished from their male counterparts by the addition of bigger lips, longer lashes or other feminizing features.</p>



<p>It’s not yet clear why people perceive the basic structure of a face as male by default, Wardle says. But in a more recent study, she and her colleagues found the same gender bias in grade school kids as young as about 5 — suggesting it arises early in life.</p>



<p>“I was not surprised that people would assign gender to illusory faces,” says Sheng He, a cognitive neuroscientist at the Chinese Academy of Sciences in Beijing who was not involved in the research. He was, however, surprised by the strength of the gender bias that Wardle’s team discovered and wonders whether people living in matriarchal societies would show the same — or perhaps the opposite — bias in their reading of faces.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/679722010/0/oupblogpsychology/">The road from Berlin in 1989 to America today</a></h4>

              
                <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://blog.oup.com/2022/01/the-road-from-berlin-in-1989-to-america-today/"><img width="480" height="185" src="https://blog.oup.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/alessandro-bellone-exRyBY3MbdI-unsplash-480x185.jpg" loading="lazy" link_thumbnail="1" /></a><p>In November 1989, the world watched with disbelief as crowds tore down the Berlin Wall. In America, we assumed that we were witnessing the end of communism and speculated about the rise of democracy in Eastern Europe and maybe even in the Soviet Union. These ideas guided our thinking for the next several years, but soon other unanticipated developments began to appear, many of which stood in striking contrast to the heady expectations of November 1989.&nbsp;</p><p>The fall of the Berlin Wall was a watershed event that made what had previously been unthinkable thinkable, and it set off a cascade of developments such as the decision by several former Soviet republics’ decision to break with Moscow and become independent sovereign states. Initial attempts to make sense of what was going on took place against a background of such incredulity that some analysts suggested it was all a feint by the Kremlin to get the West to let its guard down. Some even denied that any real upheaval had occurred at all. For many people in Eastern Europe and the USSR, though, 1989 was the moment they began to imagine a future that differed radically from anything they previously deemed possible.</p><p>Much of this is now forgotten in the United States due to our short attention span and collective memory, but elsewhere it is remembered very well. I have in mind China in particular. This may come as a surprise to Americans, but in Beijing decisions made in 1989 by General Secretary of the Soviet Communist Party Mikhail Gorbachev continue to be studied avidly in an effort to understand how states and entire societies can collapse if they do not have a strong, even brutal, leader at the helm. In both China and Russia, national memory of social upheaval extends back centuries, and in both places, the pantheon of heroic leaders includes figures who brutally crushed any hint of rebellion. For China, then, the story of Gorbachev’s failure in 1989 serves as an object lesson about what comes with having inept and weak leaders.&nbsp;</p><p>In 2021, this has given rise to a strange and shocking irony for America. Today, public figures in Russia and China see clear parallels between the demise of the Soviet Union a few decades ago and the situation in the US today. This is sometimes formulated as advice from a concerned friend. For example, the&nbsp;<em>Global Times</em>, a nationalistic paper in China published a column titled the&nbsp;<a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://www.globaltimes.cn/page/202101/1212702.shtml">“World recoils in horror at alarm sounded by Capitol riots”</a>&nbsp;in which it warned America of an impending danger. To compound this irony, the column drew on words from Mikhail Gorbachev, who believed the US could follow the path of the USSR to disintegration and warned that “the events called into question the US&#8217; [sic] continued existence as a nation.”&nbsp;</p><p>Such assessments in Chinese media of course amount to praise for the supposed far-sighted vision of the Chinese Communist Party and its infallibility in dealing with dissent at home. But these warnings are harder to laugh off in an America characterized by the extreme polarization and an attempted overthrow of a presidential election in January 2020. And these warnings are coming not just from China and Russia. Responsible and thoughtful Western figures have come to similar conclusions. In the US, for example, Fiona Hill, a distinguished Russia watcher at the Brookings Institution, outlines ominous parallels in her powerful new volume&nbsp;<em>There Is No Place for You Here</em>, where she warns that “Russia Is America’s Ghost of Christmas Future.”</p><p>Such a vision of where we would be in 2021 was completely unimaginable in 1989. In retrospect, however, some of the advice we were so busy giving others at the time on how to run a democracy might have been better applied at home. Had we seen this strange course of events unfolding ahead of us, would we have addressed impending problems of our own?&nbsp;<em>Could</em>&nbsp;we have? Or will the events that followed the fall of the Berlin Wall 30 years ago remain an episode in human history that no one seems to understand, let alone control? Another 30 years will tell.&nbsp;</p><p><em><sub>Featured image by&nbsp;<a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://unsplash.com/@alessandro_bellone">Alessandro Bellone</a>&nbsp;on&nbsp;<a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/oupblogpsychology/~https://unsplash.com/photos/exRyBY3MbdI">Unsplash</a></sub></em></p><Img align="left" border="0" height="1" width="1" style="border:0;float:left;margin:0;padding:0;width:1px!important;height:1px!important;" hspace="0" src="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/i/679722010/0/oupblogpsychology"><div style="clear:both;padding-top:0.2em;"><a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/2/679722010/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/fbshare20.png" style="border:0;margin:0;padding:0;"></a>&#160;<a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/28/679722010/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/fblike20.png" style="border:0;margin:0;padding:0;"></a>&#160;<a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/16/679722010/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/linkedin20.png" style="border:0;margin:0;padding:0;"></a>&#160;<a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/29/679722010/oupblogpsychology,https%3a%2f%2fblog.oup.com%2fwp-content%2fuploads%2f2022%2f01%2falessandro-bellone-exRyBY3MbdI-unsplash-480x185.jpg"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/pinterest20.png" style="border:0;margin:0;padding:0;"></a>&#160;<a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/1/679722010/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/reddit20.png" style="border:0;margin:0;padding:0;"></a>&#160;<a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/24/679722010/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/twitter20.png" style="border:0;margin:0;padding:0;"></a>&#160;<a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/19/679722010/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/email20.png" style="border:0;margin:0;padding:0;"></a>&#160;<a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/20/679722010/oupblogpsychology"><img height="20" src="https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/rss20.png" style="border:0;margin:0;padding:0;"></a><h3 style="clear:left;padding-top:10px">Related Stories</h3><ul><li><a rel="NOFOLLOW" href="https://blog.oup.com/2022/01/majority-rule-is-not-democracy/">Majority rule is not democracy</a></li><li><a rel="NOFOLLOW" href="https://blog.oup.com/2022/01/importance-and-uncertainty-referendums-in-the-united-kingdom/">Importance and uncertainty: referendums in the United Kingdom</a></li><li><a rel="NOFOLLOW" href="https://blog.oup.com/2022/01/do-look-up-could-a-comet-really-kill-us-all/">Do Look Up!

This sees donor money channelled through non-profit organisations like NVF, which in the US are not required to disclose their donors. Arabella’s network, said the <i>NYT</i>, is a leading vehicle for doing this on the left.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif; font-size: 12pt;">As I understand it, this allows funders to donate to a non-profit that then distributes the money to different groups without it being publicly known who the donor was. As part of this process Arabella Advisors provides administrative services to organisations like NVF, much in the way that NVF provides such services to SPARC. Unlike NVF, however, Arabella is a for-profit organisation.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif; font-size: 12pt;">The money channelled through NVF is not insubstantial. “Between 2007 and last year,” the <i>NYT </i></span><span lang="EN" style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif; font-size: 12pt;"><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/13/business/media/wyss-tribune-company-buyer.html?utm_source=pocket_mylist"><span lang="EN-GB">reported</span></a></span><span style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif; font-size: 12pt;">, “the Wyss Foundation donated roughly $56.5 million to New Venture Fund.” (This figure is based on tax returns and </span><span lang="EN" style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif; font-size: 12pt;"><a href="https://www.wyssfoundation.org/grants"><span lang="EN-GB">voluntary disclosures</span></a></span><span style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif; font-size: 12pt;">).</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif; font-size: 12pt;">Neither </span><i style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif; font-size: 12pt;">NYT</i><span style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif; font-size: 12pt;">article mentions SPARC, but it is one of around 150 “projects” that have administrative agreements with NVF. In doing so they become part of a non-profit mother ship that confers non-profit status on them too.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif; font-size: 12pt;">Referred to as fiscal sponsorship this practice has been increasing in popularity in recent years. And it is a model that a number of open access organisations have begun to use.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif; font-size: 12pt;">What is not clear to me is how many OA advocates are aware that OA organisations have started to use fiscal sponsorship and, if they are, whether they fully understand how it works and are comfortable with it.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif; font-size: 12pt;">I confess I had myself barely registered the fact that SPARC had decoupled from ARL. And as I think will be apparent, I do not fully understand how fiscal sponsorship works, or the implications it might have for the OA movement if widely adopted by OA organisations and initiatives. I do, however, have some thoughts on it.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif; font-size: 12pt;">Wikipedia </span><span lang="EN" style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif; font-size: 12pt;"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiscal_sponsorship"><span lang="EN-GB">says</span></a></span><span style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif; font-size: 12pt;"> this of the model: “Fiscal sponsorship refers to the practice of non-profit organisations offering their legal and tax-exempt status to groups – typically projects – engaged in activities related to the sponsoring organisation’s mission. It typically involves a fee-based contractual arrangement between a project and an established non-profit.”</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif; font-size: 12pt;">I think it is worth repeating that while the groups it manages are non-profit, Arabella Advisors is itself a for-profit organisation.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif; font-size: 12pt;">Small organisations can undoubtedly benefit from outsourcing their administration in this way. However, Wikipedia </span><span lang="EN" style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif; font-size: 12pt;"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiscal_sponsorship#Risks"><span lang="EN-GB">points out</span></a></span><span style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif; font-size: 12pt;"> that there are risks too. For instance, it says, “the benefits of immediate tax-exempt status and administrative support must be weighed against the lack of autonomy and fees typically charged by the sponsor.”</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif; font-size: 12pt;">It seems to me that any OA organisation signing a fiscal sponsorship agreement that wishes to remain true to its principles ought really to make a special effort to be transparent about its finances and activities. The risk is that it could end up embracing a degree of darkness that belies its commitment to openness.<span></span></span></p><a name='more'></a><p></p><h2><span style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif; line-height: 115%;"><span style="font-size: large;">Two issues</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></span></h2><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif; font-size: 12pt;">As one of 150 projects managed by NVF, for instance, SPARC’s financial statements appear to be amalgamated into NFV’s public disclosure document – its </span><span lang="EN" style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif; font-size: 12pt;"><a href="https://newventurefund.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/NVF-2020-Public-Disclosure-Copy-1.pdf"><span lang="EN-GB">990 Form</span></a></span><span style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif; font-size: 12pt;">. In the process, SPARC’s financial figures are invisibilised, at least so far as the public eye is concerned.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif; font-size: 12pt;">The only financial information related to SPARC that I could find in NVF’s </span><span lang="EN" style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif; font-size: 12pt;"><a href="https://newventurefund.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/NVF-2020-Public-Disclosure-Copy-1.pdf"><span lang="EN-GB">900 Form</span></a></span><span style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif; font-size: 12pt;"> is the salary of Heather Joseph ($313,068 in 2020). The word “SPARC” itself does not seem to appear anywhere in the 990 Form.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif; font-size: 12pt;">We could also note that SPARC does not publish a definitive list of the grants it co-sponsors. This is not a consequence of SPARC’s agreement with NVF, says Joseph, but the insistence of some funders that they remain anonymous.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif; font-size: 12pt;">A requirement of the contract that SPARC has signed with NVF, however, is that it is not made publicly available. While this might be for understandable reasons, it adds to a sense of opaqueness around SPARC’s activities and might cause some to wonder to what extent SPARC has retained self-determination.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif; font-size: 12pt;">Joseph insists that SPARC is still entirely independent. She also points out that the details of the arrangement SPARC had with ARL were not published either. However, SPARC is not the organisation today that it was when it was under ARL’s wing – that, after all, is why SPARC moved to NVF.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif; font-size: 12pt;">What is also not clear (to me at least) is why NVF needs to use for-profit Arabella Advisors to provide it with services that it itself provides to others. Again, there may be a good reason for this, but it surely further muddies the waters from a public perception point of view.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif; font-size: 12pt;">In short, I am not convinced that SPARC’s fiscal sponsorship arrangement with NVF (and, via NVF, its relationship with Arabella Advisors) is a good fit for an organisation dedicated to making the world a more open and transparent place, and which is now </span><span lang="EN" style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif; font-size: 12pt;"><a href="https://investinopen.org/blog/invest-in-open-infrastructure-launches/"><span lang="EN-GB">supporting</span></a></span><span style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif; font-size: 12pt;"> those in the open access movement who want to take back scholarly publishing from for-profit organisations. However, more transparency from SPARC would surely help.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif; font-size: 12pt;">Essentially, I see two main issues. First, as noted, SPARC’s financial statements are not publicly available. While Joseph agreed to share with me the headline income figures for 2020 (below), we might wonder why it was necessary to ask for them. And we might wonder why SPARC does not publish its full financial figures on its website every year.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif; font-size: 12pt;">Here too Joseph points out that when SPARC was a program within ARL its financial statements were not posted online either. As such, she says, it is just a continuation of a long-standing practice and not contingent on its relationship with NVF. Personally, I am not persuaded by the long-standing practice argument – particularly given the OA movement’s demands that publishers provide ever greater transparency about their operations.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif; font-size: 12pt;">Second, in not publishing a comprehensive list of the grants it co-sponsors with NVF, SPARC might seem to be acting against the principles of openness that it espouses. True, some grants </span><i style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif; font-size: 12pt;">are</i><span style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif; font-size: 12pt;"> disclosed, but what percentage of the total funds distributed this represents is unclear. Joseph says that the “vast majority of philanthropies that SPARC has received funding from” are happy to have SPARC publicly acknowledge them. What this means in practice would only be fully apparent if SPARC published a full, detailed list.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif; font-size: 12pt;">Joseph explains that SPARC has to be pragmatic about this because donors sometimes insist on anonymity. I take this to mean that if SPARC wants to receive money from such a donor it has to choose either to compromise on its commitment to openness, or forego the proffered grant. Some might feel that SPARC should not be compromising in this way. And while it may not be a consequence of SPARC’s agreement with NVF, it does raise questions about openness.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif; font-size: 12pt;">We might also wonder why any funder who wants to support an organisation whose </span><i style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif; font-size: 12pt;">raison d’être</i><span style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif; font-size: 12pt;">is to increase openness and transparency would insist on darkness. Call me naïve if you will.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif; font-size: 12pt;">It could be argued that, as a membership organisation, SPARC has no obligation to share information about its finances with the world. However, leaving aside SPARC’s professed support for openness, 50% of its income comes from grants rather than membership dues. It also enjoys the tax benefits of being part of a </span><span lang="EN" style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif; font-size: 12pt;"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/501(c)(3)_organization"><span lang="EN-GB">501c3 non-profit</span></a></span><span style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif; font-size: 12pt;">. That suggests to me that there <i>is</i> an obligation on SPARC to publish its financial statements.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif; font-size: 12pt;">More importantly, perhaps, as an influential advocacy group, SPARC has had – and continues to have – a significant impact on the global research community. More specifically, it has played an important role in changing the way that scholarly publishing operates. Potentially, therefore, its lobbying activities are going to have an impact on every researcher in the world.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif; font-size: 12pt;">Moreover, these changes seem set to embed and, arguably, worsen the existing inequalities in the system – which I must assume is not an outcome a social justice group like SPARC would have predicted or wanted.</span><span style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif; font-size: 12pt;">&nbsp;</span></p><h2 style="line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif;"><span style="font-size: large;">Complicated</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></span></h2><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif; font-size: 12pt; mso-ansi-language: EN-GB;">It does not help that the fiscal sponsorship model is complicated and (for me at least) difficult to understand. Even some of the nomenclature used appears not to be universally agreed upon, or clear.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif; font-size: 12pt;">Joseph (rightly as it happens) challenged my use of the term “subsidiary” when describing the relationship between Arabella and NVF, but she also rejected </span><i style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif; font-size: 12pt;">NYT’s</i><span style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif; font-size: 12pt;"> description of NVF as an “Arabella-managed non-profit” – presumably to make the point that, even if it has outsourced all its administrative tasks and some/most (?) of its legal responsibilities, SPARC is still in control of its own fate.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif; font-size: 12pt;">I certainly don’t question what Joseph says but as the agreement with NVF is not publicly available we are not able to judge for ourselves how independent SPARC is today. We might also wonder whether, in its relationship with NVF (and thus Arabella), SPARC has positioned itself in a larger political landscape that some OA advocates may find unpalatable or alienating.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif; font-size: 12pt;">A key question I think is whether the scholarly community is aware of how fiscal sponsorship works, and, more specifically, of how the relationship between SPARC and NVF operates. If it is, is it comfortable with the arrangement?</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif; font-size: 12pt;">When I put this to Joseph she replied, “Yes, I do believe our member community is aware of the arrangements.” However, this was surely an answer to a different question to the one I posed. I asked whether the larger </span><i style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif; font-size: 12pt;">scholarly </i><span style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif; font-size: 12pt;">community understands and is comfortable with the arrangement.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif; font-size: 12pt;">I contacted seven prominent OA advocates to put this question to them. Two did not reply, three said they were either unaware that SPARC had a fiscal sponsorship agreement or did not feel sufficiently competent or knowledgeable about the model to comment.

NVF was the best fit for a variety of reasons including cost, services, and mission alignment.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif; font-size: 12pt;">There are quite a few advantages of having a fiscal sponsor, particularly if you are a small organisation (SPARC had only 4 FTE when we made the move). Because they provide services across a large number of projects (NVF currently provides services to over 150 projects), it lets us take advantage of economies of scale on everything from health insurance to retirement benefits to legal services we simply couldn’t do on our own.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif; font-size: 12pt;">It also allows SPARC staff to focus on mission-critical activities and leave the bulk of legal, human resources, accounting, and administrative tasks, etc. to NVF.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif; font-size: 12pt;">An added draw for us was that NVF also provides SPARC with a large community of other social justice organisations and initiatives, and we’ve benefited greatly from being a part of it.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif; font-size: 12pt;">And – you are correct, the agreement was not posted publicly; given the wide range of sensitive issue areas their projects cover, it’s NVF’s policy not to do so.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif; font-size: 12pt;">For what it’s worth, we didn’t post our annual operating contracts with ARL either.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif; font-size: 12pt;">BTW: the use of fiscal sponsor organisations is on the increase in the open movement; in particular </span><span lang="EN" style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif; font-size: 12pt;"><a href="https://codeforscience.org/"><span lang="EN-GB" style="color: #1155cc; mso-ansi-language: EN-GB;">Code for Science &amp; Society</span></a></span><span style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif; font-size: 12pt;"> is emerging as a popular choice – their projects include </span><span lang="EN" style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif; font-size: 12pt;"><a href="https://www.prereview.org/"><span lang="EN-GB" style="color: #1155cc; mso-ansi-language: EN-GB;">PREreview</span></a></span><span style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif; font-size: 12pt;">, </span><span lang="EN" style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif; font-size: 12pt;"><a href="https://investinopen.org/"><span lang="EN-GB" style="color: #1155cc; mso-ansi-language: EN-GB;">Invest in Open Infrastructure</span></a></span><span style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif; font-size: 12pt;">, </span><span lang="EN" style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif; font-size: 12pt;"><a href="https://www.researchsoft.org/"><span lang="EN-GB" style="color: #1155cc; mso-ansi-language: EN-GB;">Research Software Alliance</span></a></span><span style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif; font-size: 12pt;">, among others.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal;"><b><i><span style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif; font-size: 12pt; mso-ansi-language: EN-GB;">RP: On Twitter recently you </span></i></b><span lang="EN" style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif; font-size: 12pt;"><a href="https://twitter.com/hjoseph/status/1479223891264430083?s=20"><b><i><span lang="EN-GB" style="color: #1155cc; mso-ansi-language: EN-GB;">said</span></i></b></a></span><b><i><span style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif; font-size: 12pt; mso-ansi-language: EN-GB;">, “New Venture Fund is our fiscal sponsor (help us w/ HR, compliance, and other back-office support).” Can you say more about this and how much SPARC pays to NVF annually?</span></i></b></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal;"><b><span style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif; font-size: 12pt; mso-ansi-language: EN-GB;">HJ:</span></b><span style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif; font-size: 12pt;"> Sure thing.

Arabella provides a variety of services to NVF (and to other non-profit fiscal sponsor organisations) on a fee-for-service basis – which the NVF 990 reflects.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif; font-size: 12pt;">And I’ve seen both of the articles you reference. The “dark money” issue is about transparency preferences of donors. As we know first-hand at SPARC, many grant-making organisations and donors prefer not to be named. That definitely presents challenges for SPARC; as you rightly point out below, as an organisation advocating for open access to knowledge, we work hard to be as open and transparent as we can be.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif; font-size: 12pt;">But we also have to balance the pragmatic realities of the grant-making world with that desire.

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/machine-learning-meteorite-antarctica">Machine learning points to prime places in Antarctica to find meteorites</a></h4>

              
                <p>The hunt for meteorites may have just gotten some new leads. A powerful new machine learning algorithm has identified <a href="http://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.abj8138">over 600 hot spots in Antarctica</a> where scientists are likely to find a bounty of the fallen alien rocks, researchers report January 26 in <em>Science Advances</em>. &nbsp;</p>



<p>Antarctica isn’t necessarily the No. 1 landing spot for meteorites, bits of extraterrestrial rock that offer a window into the birth and evolution of the solar system. Previous estimates suggest more meteorites probably <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/meteorites-might-be-more-likely-strike-near-equator">land closer to the equator</a> (<em>SN: 5/29/20</em>). But the southern continent is still the best place to find them, says Veronica Tollenaar, a glaciologist at the Université libre de Bruxelles in Belgium. Not only are the dark specks at the surface starkly visible against the white background, but quirks of the ice sheet’s flow can also concentrate meteorites in “stranding zones.”</p>



<p>The trouble is that so far, meteorite stranding zones have been found by luck. Satellites help, but poring through the images is time-consuming, and field reconnaissance is costly. So Tollenaar and her colleagues trained computers to find these zones more quickly.</p>



<div class="wp-block-sciencenews-content-sidebar">
<h3>Space rocks’ road</h3>



<p>This diagram shows what happens when a slowly creeping ice sheet, with meteorites (black dots) embedded in deeper layers, encounters a topographic rise such as a mountain. That obstacle bends the ice sheet’s layers upward, concentrating the space rocks embedded in them into a meteorite stranding zone. In regions where snow turns into water vapor (red arrows) faster than it accumulates, called blue ice areas, these stranding zones are particularly visible.</p>

</div>



<p>Such stranding zones form when the slow creep of the ice sheet over the land encounters a mountain or hidden rise in the ground. That barrier shifts the flow upward, carrying any embedded space rocks toward the surface.</p>



<p>Combining a machine learning algorithm with data on the ice’s velocity and thickness, surface temperatures, the shape of the bedrock and known stranding zones, Tollenaar and colleagues created a map of 613 probable meteorite hot spots, including some near existing Antarctic research stations.</p>





<p>To date, about 45,000 meteorites have been plucked from the ice. But that’s a fraction of the 300,000 bits of space rock estimated to lie somewhere on the continent’s surface.</p>



<p>The team has yet to test the map on the ground; a COVID-19 outbreak at the Belgian station in December halted plans to try it during the 2021–2022 field season. It will try again next year. Meanwhile, the team is making <a href="https://wheretocatchafallingstar.science/">these data freely accessible</a> to other researchers, hoping they’ll take up the hunt as well.</p>



<div class="wp-block-sciencenews-content-sidebar">
<h2>Marking the spots </h2>



<p>Using a machine learning algorithm, researchers trained computers to identify the likeliest locations of meteorite stranding zones across Antarctica. Many of these zones (in red) are located near existing research stations (small tents).

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/arctic-hare-distance-record-biology">An Arctic hare traveled at least 388 kilometers in a record-breaking journey</a></h4>

              
                <p>Arctic hares can go the distance. A member of <em>Lepus arcticus</em> in northern Canada has traveled farther than anyone knew possible.</p>



<p>BBYY, as the adult female was known, made <a href="https://esajournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ecy.3620">a wild dash of more than 388 kilometers</a> in 49 days — the longest distance ever recorded among hares, rabbits or any other relatives — researchers report online December 22 in <em>Ecology</em>.</p>



<p>“To think that such a small animal living under such extreme conditions averaged about eight kilometers per day across seven weeks is truly astounding,” says Joel Berger, an ecologist at Colorado State University in Fort Collins and a senior scientist at the Wildlife Conservation Society in Bronx, N.Y., who was not involved in the study.<br><br>Arctic hares — which weigh roughly the same as house cats, about four kilograms — are desirable prey for foxes and wolves on the tundra. Given the hares’ important role in the Arctic food web, mammalian ecologist Dominque Berteaux of the Université du Québec à Rimouski wanted to know how the animals move across the arid landscape.</p>



<p>In 2019, Berteaux and colleagues affixed satellite tracking collars on 25 hares captured near the northern tip of Ellesmere Island in Nunavut, Canada. As the hares swiftly hopped away, the researchers had no idea the creatures were beginning a mind-blowing expedition across the tundra, Berteaux says. That’s because hares and their relatives, called <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/nature-ramblings-two-extra-teeth">lagomorphs</a> (<em>SN: 3/8/58</em>), typically spend their lives within a single, familiar territory where food is plentiful and easy to find.</p>





<p>The Arctic hares thumped that trend, with most traveling anywhere between 113 and 310 kilometers. None came close to BBYY, who died of unknown causes about a month after reaching her final destination.</p>



<p>For a hare to endure such a perilous journey, it must balance the need to find food without becoming food, says Dennis Murray, a terrestrial ecologist at Trent University in Peterborough, Canada, who wasn’t involved in the work. That makes BBYY’s excursion even more impressive, he says.</p>



<p>Berteaux and colleagues hope data from BBYY and the other hares can help inform conservation strategies for the polar desert ecosystem. But even at this early stage, it’s exciting to find “something unsuspected in an animal that we thought we knew quite well,” Berteaux says.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/athlete-mental-health-mindfulness-psychology-elite-olympics">How mindfulness-based training can give elite athletes a mental edge</a></h4>

              
                <p class="has-drop-cap" style="font-size:20px">On yellow poster board, blue letters spell BELIEVE, a nod to the Emmy-winning TV show <em>Ted Lasso</em>. The sign hangs above mindfulness researcher Tommy Minkler’s office door at West Virginia University, a reminder to trust in the work he’s doing to help elite athletes.</p>



<p>In the show, Lasso, an American football coach, is recruited to head an English football team. His experience coaching American football, an utterly different game than soccer, leaves him lacking overseas, so he relies on his positive attitude and folksy charm to bond with his players. On his first day coaching, Lasso posts the BELIEVE sign above his office door. The team often rallies around the sign just before hitting the field.</p>



<p>But belief alone can’t get athletes to the goal when they run into the psychological speed bumps or full-on roadblocks that can arise during training and competition. When Lasso’s striker Dani Rojas faced the yips — suddenly unable to nail his usually flawless penalty kicks — a therapist was called in. In real life, when the twisties hit U.S. gymnast Simone Biles at last summer’s Olympics in Tokyo, she withdrew from five of six event finals. Biles’ mental block was petrifying; one wrong move on the uneven bars or a failed flip on the balance beam could cause a devastating injury, or even death. Her decision to withdraw from competition after years of intense training shocked the world, from commentators to armchair athletes.</p>



<p>Elite athletes are expected to be unflappable. Admitting vulnerability is “so fundamentally at odds with being a competitor,” retired U.S. figure skater Sasha Cohen, who won a silver medal at the 2006 Winter Olympics, explained in the 2020 HBO documentary <em>The Weight of Gold</em>. Sport is war. Competing at the elite level requires strategy and posturing. “You need to show the world you are strong. You need to show your competitors you are strong,” Cohen said. “If you were to say, ‘Oh, I have mental health issues,’ that just cracks the facade.”</p>





<p>In society, those cracks are often seen as weakness, a faulty perception that prevents athletes from talking about their problems. That stigma is, in fact, the <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31092400/">strongest barrier to athletes seeking help</a>, says psychiatrist João Mauricio Castaldelli-Maia of the University of São Paulo. He and colleagues reviewed 52 studies on mental health and elite athletes in the <em>British Journal of Sports Medicine</em> in 2019.</p>



<p>Reactions to Biles’ decision made clear that the stigma still exists. She faced backlash after withdrawing from several Olympics events, as did Japanese tennis star Naomi Osaka, who pulled out of the 2021 French Open to focus on her mental health. But amid the vitriol, Biles and Osaka had supporters, including fellow athletes who were inspired by these choices. “I didn’t even know that was an option,” U.S. figure skater Nathan Chen, a medal favorite at the upcoming Winter Olympics, said of Biles’ decision, at an October news briefing.</p>

<p>The International Olympic Committee, the U.S. Olympic &amp; Paralympic Committee and other sports organizations have begun to acknowledge the importance of mental health. Just because elite athletes are at peak physical fitness, their mental fitness is not guaranteed. Since 2018, sports-governing agencies, including the IOC, and health organizations have released a rash of position statements on the mental health symptoms, such as anxiety, depression and eating disorders, that are common among elite athletes, the factors contributing to those symptoms and the psychological tools that might help competitors on and off the field.</p>



<p>There’s also been an explosion of research into elite athletes’ mental health in the last few years, says sports and clinical psychologist Carolina Lundqvist of Linköping University in Sweden, citing <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/1750984X.2019.1689574">a 2020 analysis</a> in<em> International Review of Sport and Exercise Psychology</em>. The research points to two promising psychological tools.</p>



<p>One is mindfulness — paying attention to, or staying in, the present moment without judgment. Another is acceptance and commitment therapy, or ACT. In conjunction with mindfulness, the therapy trains a person to accept difficult thoughts or feelings rather than actively work to get rid of them. Studies have shown that these tools can improve athletic performance — and, importantly, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/good-life-happy-meaning-richness-change-experiences-psychology">lead to a richer life off the ice or the court</a>.</p>



<p>Athletes “are human beings first,” says Minkler, the <em>Ted Lasso</em> enthusiast. Their life is not all about winning medals or championships. Mindfulness and ACT help athletes “learn more about themselves and engage differently with their thoughts and emotions,” he says. It teaches them to be better people.</p>



<div class="wp-block-sciencenews-content-sidebar">
<h3>A sizeable problem&nbsp;</h3>



<p>Athletes can be reluctant to report mental health problems because of stigma. In a <a href="https://bjsm.bmj.com/content/bjsports/53/11/667.full.pdf">2019 consensus statement from the International Olympic Committee</a>, data on mental health disorders in elite athletes were limited, but depression and anxiety rates appeared similar to the general public’s. Eating disorder rates were higher in athletes.</p>

<h4>Team tests</h4>



<p>On the women’s lacrosse field at Marymount University in Arlington, Va., players toss the ball with an intense focus on their grip of the lacrosse stick, the snap of their wrists and the weight of the ball as they catch it and pass it on. To an outsider, the drills might seem routine, but the women were paying extra attention to the task. The focused attention is a result of experiments that Minkler (a former lacrosse coach), Washington, D.C.–based psychologist Tim Pineau and colleagues have run with the team in the last few years.</p>



<p>The researchers wanted to know if mindfulness training could improve player performance and overall well-being. With buy-in from the school’s athletic director and lacrosse coach, Pineau led the players through six weeks of mindfulness training during preseason, then monthly follow-ups over several seasons.</p>



<p>The mindfulness sessions started with stationary meditations focusing on breathing and self-compassion, then progressed to mindful yoga and walking, and finally to throwing and catching exercises. Along with the meditative work, the players talked about what they’d learned in group discussions, describing how they used the training to let go of mistakes. The coach reported that the players were more focused on the second-to-second decisions of the game, rather than dwelling on something that had gone wrong.</p>



<p>In post-training surveys, players reported feeling that they could slip into that state of being totally immersed in the game, what is often called a flow state or being in the zone, much more easily after the mindfulness training. And they said they were less anxious about playing lacrosse. Before training, the team had four wins and 15 losses. In the season after the training, the team won more games than it lost and qualified for the regional conference championship. The next season, <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/21520704.2018.1549639?journalCode=uspa20">the team won the regional conference championship</a>, the researchers reported in 2019 in the <em>Journal of Sport Psychology in Action</em>.</p>

<p>The findings reinforce results from a mindfulness study with the University of Miami football team, the Hurricanes. Amishi Jha, a neuroscientist at the university, teamed with Hurricanes head coach, Al Golden, and his players to track how well they paid attention during preseason training. Jha and her colleagues measured the players’ focus in the lab by having them hit the space bar on a keyboard when they saw certain numbers on a computer screen, such as 2 or 4. Players were told not to hit the bar when they saw other numbers, like 3. The stronger their attention, the better players were at not hitting the space bar when the number 3 flashed across the screen.</p>



<p>After measuring baseline attention of the players, the researchers divided the players into two groups: one worked through a four-week training with mindfulness meditations, while the other received four weeks of relaxation exercises. Mindfulness exercises focused on bringing attention back to the present moment whenever the mind strayed; relaxation exercises focused on relieving tension, without focusing cues.</p>



<p>In previous experiments with emergency medical and military professionals, Jha had found that high stress, poor mood and perceived threats can disrupt focus. In this study, she had the Miami players complete their mindfulness or relaxation work during preseason training, the grueling physical workouts that help coaches decide who gets cut from the team.</p>



<p>When given the computer attention test after preseason training ended, the players didn’t focus as well as before. And they reported being more anxious, more depressed and less happy overall, a result of being stressed from the physicality of football training, Jha says.</p>



<p>Although their focus declined in the high-stress setting, the attention of players who regularly practiced mindfulness exercises <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s41465-017-0016-5">dropped less drastically</a> than those who regularly practiced relaxation exercises, Jha and colleagues reported in the<em> Journal of Cognitive Enhancement </em>in 2017.</p>



<p>“Attention is the fuel for our ability to not just think and do cognitively demanding tasks, but to regulate our emotion and connect” with other people, Jha says. Protecting the ability to pay attention can protect mental health, she explains in her 2021 book <em><a href="https://amishi.com/books/peak-mind">Peak Mind</a></em>, which explains how to build mental “muscles” in as little as 12 minutes a day.</p>

<p>The longer the University of Miami Hurricanes practiced mindfulness, the less their ability to pay attention dropped during a period of intense physical training. </p>

<h4>Learned discipline</h4>



<p>Meditative trainings are like a push-up for the mind. It takes practice, Minkler says. “You can’t meditate once for 10 minutes and say, ‘I’m mindful and in the present,’ just like you wouldn’t go in the weight room and do five push-ups and say, “That’s it, that’s all I need to do,’ ” he says. “You have to work at it. You have to be disciplined.”</p>



<p>Graham Mertz, quarterback for the University of Wisconsin–Madison, has said he’s seen results with mindfulness training. After what he felt was a disappointing season in 2020, Mertz began working with the Wisconsin Badgers’ director of meditation training, Chad McGehee. That training helped Mertz <a href="https://madison.com/wsj/sports/college/football/graham-mertz-spent-the-offseason-training-to-be-a-better-qb-how-he-did-it/article_84c6141a-0803-5c7f-9e51-7f4b49599b3e.html">figure out how to reset himself mentally</a> between a game’s offensive plays, he told the <em>Wisconsin State Journal</em>. There’s roughly 40 seconds between plays, and Mertz says he spent a lot of time identifying “anchors” to bring his attention back to the moment and leave the play that just happened in the past.</p>



<p>The best approach he found was to take a deep breath, close his eyes and rub his fingertips together. The Badgers finished the 2021 season with eight wins and four losses, plus a win in December’s Las Vegas Bowl.</p>



<p>Mertz’s story, while just one person’s experience, supports Minkler’s and Jha’s findings, which suggest mindfulness could be an essential tool that athletes should pack in their bags for game day. But the work comes with caveats. Analyses have shown that <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0153220">mindfulness researchers tend to overreport positive findings</a>. And for some people, studies suggest, focused breathing and other mindfulness exercises can bring up past trauma, causing distress, Minkler says. Having clinical psychologists on hand to work with athletes who have this reaction to mindfulness training is important.</p>

<h4>No judgments</h4>



<p>Acceptance and commitment therapy, or ACT, is another technique counselors are using to help athletes improve not only their performance but their overall mental health. The goal of ACT is to teach athletes to separate their competitor identity from their personal one.</p>



<p>ACT does not attempt to change negative thoughts, such as “I suck today,” but to acknowledge the thought as something completely independent of who or how talented the athlete is. By accepting the negative thought, rather than getting stuck in a downward spiral of trying to combat it with counterarguments, an athlete can bring her focus back to the race or game at hand.</p>



<p>For a triathlete, who can spend up to 17 hours swimming, biking and running in a race, letting go of the detrimental self-talk can be extremely important when a competitor moves in front, or when the race is long and an athlete wants to give up, says Eugene Koh Boon Yau, a psychiatrist at the University of Putra Malaysia in Seri Kembangan. In the last few years, Yau worked with three triathletes competing to represent Malaysia at international competitions. All three struggled with self-doubt.</p>



<p>Over six weeks, he walked each athlete through a mental training on mindfulness so each learned to notice and label their thoughts and emotions, especially negative ones, and then accept those thoughts without judgment. Then each athlete identified his values and what he wanted to be remembered for, should his career end the next day. Yau and each athlete then discussed how to use mindfulness and thought acceptance during a race to stay focused on performance without getting wrapped up in what competitors were doing.</p>



<div class="wp-block-sciencenews-content-sidebar alignright">
<h2 style="text-align: center;font-size:96px;font-weight:300;margin:10px;line-height:70%">12</h2><h5 style="text-align: center">minutes</h5><p style="text-align: center">Minimum daily mindfulness practice time it takes to build mental “muscles”</p>
</div>



<p>The training “does help me with reducing anxiety and overthinking,” says triathlete Edwin Thiang, who worked with Yau. Thiang says he’s still surprised by how vital the training is, especially in high-stakes races. It calms him down and helps him stay focused.</p>



<p>The other athletes who worked with Yau agree. One triathlete said he found it easier to accept thoughts of self-doubt when a competitor overtook him. Before the mental training, the athlete would slow down in such situations, giving up hope of finishing high in the rankings. After the training, he identified his self-doubt as an emotion, not a reality. By shifting his attention back to the mechanics of either swimming, biking or running, he could keep the pace he set for himself during the race. Another of the triathletes reported that the training <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/21520704.2021.1920522">helped him stay committed to physical training</a>, Yau and colleagues reported in the May 2021 <em>Journal of Sport Psychology in Action</em>.</p>



<p>Those results align with a study that pitted mindfulness and elements of ACT against some of the traditional, performance-focused psychological tools athletes have been taught for decades, such as visualization, relaxation (similar to what was used in Jha’s study) and positive self-talk. In that experiment, 18 women’s basketball players at a Division III university in New Jersey were divided into two groups. One worked through relaxation and stress management exercises developed by psychologist Richard Suinn and described in the 1986 book<em> Seven Steps to Peak Performance</em>. The other group worked through exercises for mindfulness and acceptance of thoughts described in the 2007 book <em>The Psychology of Enhancing Human Performance</em>: <em>The Mindfulness-Acceptance-Commitment (MAC) Approach</em> by psychologists Frank Gardner and Zella Moore.</p>



<p>A month after the study ended, MAC-trained players had dips in anxiety, substance use, eating issues and overall psychological distress, along with gains in emotional regulation. Players <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/1612197X.2016.1250802">trained in traditional psychological skills</a> had less improvement in those areas, Princeton University psychologist Mike Gross and colleagues reported in 2018 in the <em>International Journal of Sport and Exercise Psychology</em>.</p>



<p>On the court, mindfulness paired with elements of ACT can quickly keep players moving and help them stay in the game, especially if they make a mistake, Gross says. “There’s less … of those mental gymnastics or the tug-of-war in the mind” that can mess up a player even more. In fact, the MAC-trained players, he says, were less likely to get extremely upset or sad and were better able to cope with changes and try creative approaches to tasks than the players trained with traditional sports psychology tools.</p>

<p>Extending that idea further, Minkler argues that performance problems rarely have anything to do with technical skills. Mental hang-ups in training and competition are often related to interpersonal issues, like relationships with teammates, coaches or loved ones. Mindfulness and ACT can help athletes work through those issues to bring their focus back to their sport, he says.</p>



<p>Mertz, the Wisconsin quarterback, would agree. He said he began to realize during his mindfulness training that he was focused so intently on football, he was neglecting the other parts of his life. He learned to pay attention to what he needed to do for his mental health, whether it was focus a bit more on prepping for the season or just taking some time to have fun. His overall mental health improved as a result, he said.</p>



<p>Researchers using these techniques say they’ve seen similar off-the-field benefits for their student ­athletes, including improved focus on readings for class and better communication with friends and family. With those results in mind, Jha say she’d like to test how mindfulness and ACT training might work for Olympic teams.</p>



<p>She has, in fact, had several briefings with U.S. and Australian Olympic team representatives about her mindfulness training. Ideally, she says, she would train Olympic coaches to work with their athletes, and then track the competitors’ performance and psychological health and attention. That kind of study is even more relevant after last year’s very public experiences of athletes such as Biles and Osaka, she says.</p>



<p>“These people we see as pillars of excellence [are experiencing] extremely dysfunctional mental states,” Jha says. “How do we have the mental fitness match the physical excellence?” Studies on mindfulness and ACT hint that a match-up is achievable, and the training might benefit not only elite athletes but every one of us.</p>



<p>“Athletes at the elite level are aspirational,” Jha says. They show us that physical training is necessary for physical health, and they’ve reminded us more recently that the mind, like the body, “needs training to stay fit,” she says, “and we can train it.”</p>

                <h2>Hi there!</h2>
<p>I am currently interning with Fedora on the project "Extend and improve NeuroFedora's user consumable artefacts".</p>
<h2>What is Fedora?</h2>
<p>Fedora is a Linux operating system. The computers we have at home are similar it has an operating system called windows, Fedora is just another one like Windows just with differnt features. The operating system tells the computer what to do when you move the mouse or press a key on the keyboard. etc . </p>
<p>So just like we have operating systems for phone like iphone and android, we also have different ones for computers like MacOS, Windows, Fedora Linux e.t.c.</p>
<p>Now to do anything more with your computer you need to have aplications just like whatsapp and twitter on our phones, on the compter you can have web browser that lets you access youtube, whatsapp etc. The process of adding new applications to your phone or computer is called installing.</p>
<p>For this internship program I make lots of applications easy to install on the Fedora Linux operating system.</p>
<p>I got this internship through Outreachy.</p>
<h2>What is Outreachy?</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.outreachy.org/">Outreachy</a> is a program that organizes three months paid internsips with free and open source software (see explanation below) projects for people who are typically underrepresented.</p>
<p>The program is mainly for women, transgender, gender queer, non-binary people, people of color, and people who face discrimination because of caste or tribe, men who face discrimination in the industry can also apply for the program.</p>
<h2>Free and open source software</h2>
<p>Is both free and open, where anyone is freely licensed to use, copy, study and change the software in any way and the souce code is openly shared that people are encouraged to voluntarily improve the design of the software .</p>
<p>Outreachy has vast list of projects to work on but I chose Fedora and I am loving the experience so far, and I am hoping even after the internship I will still be an active contributor to Fedora.</p>

                <p>I recently read Philip Goff’s book, “Galileo’s error”, where he advocates for the panpsychist view that consciousness is a widespread element of reality, so that atoms are very slightly conscious (note that we should talk of panpsychism<em>s</em> as there are certainly variations on this theme). The book is well written and does a good job at explaining the issues with the different brands of materialism and dualism. It also pushed me to refine some concepts and revisit some issues, which is good.</p>
<p>However, I was not convinced by his proposal. To me, it seems that it boils down to another “what else?” argument: materialism is flawed, dualism is false, therefore panpsychism is true. This cannot be a reasonable response to the fallacious “what else?” argument of materialists: if you are not a materialist, then you are a dualist.</p>
<p>The argument in a few words (certainly a bit caricatured) is that consciousness cannot be reduced to the physical properties of matter, and therefore it must be an additional fundamental property of matter, in some way what atoms are “made of”. Then comes the so-called “combination problem”, which is to understand how atoms get together to form a single conscious entity, a problem that Goff admits is unsolved. This is a strikingly reductionist account of consciousness: if we are conscious, it must be because parts of us are conscious.</p>
<p>As mentioned above, there are different panpsychisms. Integrated Information Theory (IIT), for example, considers consciousness as a property of certain kinds of systems, not a property of atoms. What they have in common, however, is that they postulate consciousness beyond life (of course, some materialist accounts also do). Towards the end of the book, Goff speculates on the ethical issues raised by the possibility that plants might be conscious, and so is it ok to have a vegan diet? But on his account, atoms are also conscious so maybe nuclear fission makes atoms suffer? Maybe nuclear fusion feels like love to atoms and the sun is a sort of gigantic hippie paradise? Who knows.</p>
<p>The fundamental problem I see with the argumentation is that “being conscious” is used as a sort of empty placeholder. The theory is meant to explain subjective perspective, but never asks what a subject might be. Free will is presented as one of the difficult things to explain, but the proposal offers no account of agency. And if atoms are conscious, do they have emotions? But what is an emotion? It seems to me that a theory of consciousness should try to address at least some basic aspects of the phenomenon to explain, beyond the mere fact that it exists.</p>
<p>These questions about subjects and agency are addressed in particular in some corners of theoretical biology, which try to develop the concept of a living organism. Typically, theories of life describe a living organism as a set of processes whose operation ensures their own continued existence; some form of organizational closure that resists entropic decay (see e.g. Varela &amp; Maturana; Kauffman; Rosen; more recently Moreno, Mossio, Montevil, to name a few). The concept of organism is what allows developing derived concepts such as agency, autonomy, but also some aspects of perception and emotion (namely the valence of emotion).</p>
<p>Goff proposes that free will is not action free from determinism, but action that has reasons. But reasons imply goals, and goals imply autonomous agents, concepts that panpsychism, whether Goff’s or IIT’s version, offers no account of. No amount of integrated information (“Phi”) provides any goal to the system, and so this theoretical construct cannot account for either free will or emotion.</p>
<p>I will now discuss a few more specific points made in the book.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>The hard problem is harder than you might think</strong></p>
<p>Everything starts with the “hard problem” of consciousness, a problem that has been discussed by many thinkers, the most well-known arguments being probably those of Chalmers and Nagel. Basically, the problem is that experience is not something that can be derived <em>deductively</em> from the properties of matter. There is no logical reasoning that would start with a mechanistic description of a material system, and that would end up with “therefore, this system feels pain”. Of course, there could be a “therefore” that means: whenever a material system has some property P, it feels pain, but this would be an empirical relation (e.g. the “neural correlates of consciousness”), not a logical relation. Basically, you cannot deduce pain from Newton laws.</p>
<p>In the book, the author takes it as a flaw of reductive materialism, the idea that consciousness is a state of matter. It certainly is a flaw of materialism, but it is much worse than that.</p>
<p>In his famous paper (What is it like to be a bat?), Nagel hits the more general problem: experience is something that you live, not something that you describe. Of course, you could try to describe an experience, but understanding the words is not the same thing as having the experience. Philosophers like to speak of the redness of red, but I find this a rather poor choice. Everyone (with some exceptions) has the feeling of red whenever something with the right spectral properties is presented, so it is easy to conflate objective properties of objects with subjective experience.</p>
<p>But consider taste, for example. Taste is interesting because not everyone has the same tastes, meaning that people can have different experiences for the same stuff, and taste can change over time. There is no need to try to imagine the ultrasonic world of bats. Consider for example coriander. Many people hate coriander, and this has been linked to some genetic variant in olfactory receptor genes. Now try to describe the taste of coriander to someone who does not like it. I personally would have no idea where to start; someone might find words to describe it, but we can be sure that the person would be essentially clueless about how it might taste. One might say that the taste of coriander is the taste caused by the activation of the corresponding olfactory receptor; one might describe the odorant molecules, and so on: none of that conveys the taste. There is just no alternative to actually experiencing an experience.</p>
<p>So the problem is much deeper than a flaw of materialism: the problem is that experience is not something that can be explained, whatever the number of words, it is something that is lived. Postulating the existence of an extra non-physical law, which says for example that the universe is made of consciousness, or that certain systems are conscious, will not solve this problem. We might want to postulate the existence of coriander taste as an extra law of nature, it would still not explain what it feels like to taste coriander. Thus, if panpsychism pretends to explain the quality of experience, then it commits the exact same error as reductive materialism. This should make us highly skeptical of claims such as “the quality of experience is specified by the informational relationships [the complex] generates” (Balduzzi &amp; Tononi, 2009) - all the more that it reduces experience to its epistemic value while neglecting the hedonic value (see below).</p>
<p>Of course, this does not mean that nothing interesting can be said <em>about</em> experience, including its relation with matter. But panpsychism is not at all necessary for that. For example, sensorimotor theories of perception have something to say about the structure of experience, for example about the spatialization of pain (see <a href="http://romainbrette.fr/category/blog/spatial-perception/spatial-perception-of-pain/">my short series on that</a>). Thus, panpsychism does not solve the hard problem. It does not dissolve it either: the problem still exists even if you consider that materialism is flawed, because it is not an issue with materialist explanations but with explanations in general.</p>
<p>Before I move on to the next topic, I would like to point out that there are certain ways to communicate experiences, but those are not descriptive. More accurately, there are ways to <em>induce</em> experiences in people. These are art, poetry, or guided meditation. A musical experience is not the end point of a logical reasoning. Guided meditation practices, or poetry, use words to put you into certain states of mind, but the words are only there to guide you (“imagine you are a mountain”), they do not constitute the experience.</p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>The case against dualism</strong></p>
<p>In his book, Goff also rejects dualism, but I found the argument rather peculiar. He claims that the main objection against dualism is empirical: we understand a lot about how the brain works, so surely we would have noticed if there were an intervention by some kind of mental entity - some scientific law would be broken, basically. This is a peculiar argument because virtually all scientific findings in neuroscience are of a statistical nature, so there is no way we would notice an intervention rather than categorize it as a random event. Our understanding of the brain is not that extensive.</p>
<p>But we can take the argument as a thought experiment. Suppose we have perfect understanding of the physical working of the brain, so we could for example predict the evolution of brain states from the current state. We could know before the subject herself what she is going to talk about, or the voluntary movements she is going to make. In other words, we would know perfectly how the “philosophical zombie” works. This knowledge is precisely the premises of the hard problem: we have a perfect mechanistic understanding of physiology and behavior, but none of this understanding implies that the person is conscious, or explains the taste of coriander.</p>
<p>If it is the case that we can have this kind of understanding (even as a theoretical possibility), then indeed dualism is false, at least the kind of dualism that supposedly explains free will and agency (as Penfield or Eccles thought).</p>
<p>But it also implies that there cannot be any <em>empirical</em> support for any panpsychist theory, since all the empirical data are already supposedly accounted for by a physicalist account. Therefore, I find it odd that Goff supports the empirical argument against dualism and at the same time claims that there is empirical support for IIT. By his own argument, that cannot be the case. If we have a physicalist account of whatever a person might say or do in different circumstances, then this will include any kind of empirical evidence that we might think of. All the empirical evidence would already be accounted for, and therefore could not count as evidence for the panpsychist theory.</p>
<p>To claim otherwise is to believe that consciousness is required to do certain things, such as speaking of what one sees. But this is contradictory with the claim that a physicalist framework can explain behavior but not consciousness. This is to give a causal role to consciousness, above the causal role of physical processes, and that is precisely Goff’s objection against dualism.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>The epistemic and the hedonic</strong></p>
<p>To end these notes, I would like to come back to the remark I made at the beginning, that a theory of consciousness should try to address at least some basic aspects of the phenomenon to explain, and not just acknowledge that it exists.</p>
<p>Ned Block pointed out that there are two aspects of consciousness that need to be accounted for: access consciousness, i.e. its functional aspects, and phenomenal consciousness or “what it is like”, the latter being notoriously more complicated than the former.</p>
<p>I would like to rephrase it as follows. Experience typically comes in at least two dimensions, an epistemic and a hedonic dimension. For example, consider toothache. That experience is informative: it aches somewhere, and perhaps you notice that it aches when you drink something cold and so on. But pain is not just information: it is also something you would like to get rid of. It has a hedonic value, namely a bad one.</p>
<p>Both IIT and global workspace theory focus on the epistemic aspect, but fail to account for the hedonic aspect (for the epistemic aspect as well, but at least they try). This might come from the failure to include life into the picture. For a living organism, there is some sense in saying that an event or an act is good or bad for the organism, according to whether it helps or threatens the organism’s self-maintenance. In contrast, there is no sense in saying that some event is good or bad for a photodiode. The photodiode has been built by some (other) conscious entity to perform a certain function, and so only that external entity can assess whether some transformation of the system is good or bad, according to whether it continues to perform the ascribed function.</p>
<p>Of course, none of this explains why an organism <em>feels</em> bad, rather than just acts accordingly, but it is certainly an aspect of the phenomenon that things that are bad for the organism also tend to <em>feel</em> bad. Without an organism, some autonomous entity for which “bad” can mean something, it seems difficult to theorize about the hedonic aspect of experience. This makes me skeptical of claims that entities that are not living organisms (atoms, photodiodes and so on) are conscious.</p>
