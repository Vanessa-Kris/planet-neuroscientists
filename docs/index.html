<p><strong>A busy week for science in Moscow </strong>—&nbsp;<a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/busy-week-science-moscow"><em>Science News</em></a><em>,</em>&nbsp;June 3, 1972</p>



<p>U.S. and Soviet leaders … signed agreements on space, science and technology, health and the environment…. The space agreement … outlines plans for cooperation in fields such as meteorology, study of the natural environment, planetary exploration and space biology.</p>



<h4>Update</h4>



<p>The 1972 space agreement led to the <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/summit-space-first-step-taken">first inter­national human spaceflight</a>, the Apollo-Soyuz mission, during which Soviet and U.S.&nbsp;crews socialized in space (<em>SN: 7/26/75, p. 52</em>). Apollo-Soyuz encouraged decades of collaboration that continues today on the International Space Station. Now, Russia’s war in Ukraine has prompted many countries <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/russia-ukraine-war-space-science-nasa">to pull back on scientific endeavors with Russia</a>, in space and on Earth (<em>SN: 3/26/22, p.&nbsp;6</em>). While NASA remains committed to the space station, the head of Russia’s space agency has threatened to end the cooperation in retaliation for sanctions imposed in response to the war. Russia has yet to make moves to abandon the station, though the country has ceased supplying rocket engines to the United States.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/pfas-forever-chemicals-uv-iodide-perfluoroalkyl-polyfluoroalkyl-sulfite">Just 3 ingredients can quickly destroy widely used PFAS ‘forever chemicals’</a></h4>

              
                <p>The undoing of toxic “forever chemicals” may be found in products in your pantry.</p>



<p>Perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances, also known as PFAS, can persist in the environment for centuries. While the health impacts of only a fraction of the thousands of different types of PFAS have been studied, research has linked exposure to high levels of some of these widespread, humanmade chemicals to health issues such as cancer and reproductive problems.</p>



<p>Now, a study shows that the combination of <a href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.est.1c07608">ultraviolet light and a couple of common chemicals</a> can break down nearly all the PFAS in a concentrated solution in just hours. The process involves blasting UV radiation at a solution containing PFAS and iodide, which is often added to table salt, and sulfite, a common food preservative, researchers report in the March 15 <em>Environmental Science &amp; Technology</em>.</p>





<p>“They show that when [iodide and sulfite] are combined, the system becomes a lot more efficient,” says Garrett McKay, an environmental chemist at Texas A&amp;M University in College Station who was not involved in the study. “It’s a big step forward.”</p>



<p>A PFAS molecule contains a chain of carbon atoms that are bonded to fluorine atoms. The carbon-fluorine bond is one the strongest known chemical bonds. This sticky bond makes PFAS useful for many applications, such as <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/pfas-chemicals-biodegradable-food-containers-compost">water- and oil-repellant coatings</a>, firefighting foams and <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/cosmetics-makeup-pfas-chemicals">cosmetics</a> (<em>SN: 6/4/19; SN: 6/15/21</em>). Owing to their widespread use and longevity, PFAS have been detected in soils, food and even drinking water. <a href="https://www.epa.gov/pfas/our-current-understanding-human-health-and-environmental-risks-pfas">The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency</a> sets healthy advisory levels for PFOA and PFOS — two common types of PFAS — at 70 parts per trillion.</p>



<p>Treatment facilities can filter PFAS out of water using technologies such as activated carbon filters or ion exchange resins. But these removal processes concentrate PFAS into a waste that requires a lot of energy and resources to destroy, says study coauthor Jinyong Liu, an environmental chemist at the University of California, Riverside. “If we don&#8217;t [destroy this waste], there will be secondary contamination concerns.”</p>



<p>One of the most well-studied ways to degrade PFAS involves mixing them into a solution with sulfite and then blasting the mixture with UV rays. The radiation rips electrons from the sulfite, which then move around, snipping the stubborn carbon-fluorine bonds and thereby breaking down the molecules.</p>



<p>But some PFAS, such as a type known as PFBS, have proven difficult to degrade this way. Liu and his colleagues irradiated a solution containing PFBS and sulfite for an entire day, only to find that less than half of the pollutant in the solution had broken down. Achieving higher levels of degradation required more time and additional sulfite to be poured in at spaced intervals.</p>



<p>The researchers knew that iodide exposed to UV radiation produces more bond-cutting electrons than sulfite. And previous research has demonstrated that UV irradiation paired with iodide alone <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0043135410001363">could be used to degrade PFAS chemicals</a>.</p>



<p>So Liu and his colleagues blasted UV rays at a solution containing PFBS, iodide and sulfite. To the researchers’ surprise, after 24 hours of irradiation, less than 1 percent of the stubborn PFBS remained.</p>



<p>What’s more, the researchers showed that the process destroyed other types of PFAS with similar efficiency and was also effective when PFAS concentrations were 10 times that which UV light and sulfite alone could degrade. And by adding iodide the researchers found that they could speed up the reaction, Liu says, making the process that much more energy efficient.</p>



<p>In the solution, iodide and sulfite worked together to sustain the destruction of PFAS molecules, Liu explains. When UV rays release an electron from iodide, that iodide is converted into a reactive molecule which may then recapture freed electrons. But here sulfite can step in and bond with these reactive molecules and with electron-scavenging oxygen in the solution. This sulfite “trap” helps keep the released electrons free to cut apart PFAS molecules for eight times longer than if sulfite wasn’t there, the researchers report.</p>



<p>It’s surprising that no one had demonstrated the effectiveness of using sulfite with iodide to degrade PFAS before, McKay says.</p>



<p>Liu and his colleagues are now collaborating with an engineering company, using their new process to treat PFAS in a concentrated waste stream. The pilot test will conclude in about two years.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/gene-drives-mosquito-malaria-crispr-africa-public-outreach">Who decides whether to use gene drives against malaria-carrying mosquitoes?</a></h4>

              
                <p class="has-drop-cap" style="font-size:20px">In a large laboratory cage, a male mosquito carries a genetic weapon that could launch the destruction of his species. That loss could also mean the end of the parasite that causes malaria.</p>



<p>The weapon, a self-replicating bit of DNA known as a gene drive, is one of the most anticipated and controversial tools being developed to stop mosquitoes from spreading diseases like malaria to humans.</p>



<p>The gene drive interferes with the insects’ ability to reproduce. It wiped out captive populations of mosquitoes in <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/lab-tests-gene-drive-wiped-out-population-mosquitoes">eight to 12 generations</a> (<em>SN: 10/27/18, p. 6</em>) in a small lab study. In 2021, the technology worked in the large cages in Terni, Italy, too. Within as little as five to 10 years, this gene drive could be ready to test in the wild.</p>





<p>The first experimental release could be rolled out in Burkina Faso, Mali, Ghana or Uganda. In those locations, researchers are working with a nonprofit research consortium called Target Malaria to develop the gene drive carriers along with other genetically engineered mosquitoes to fight malaria.</p>



<p>This research is driven by the idea that every tool available must be used to fight malaria, which <a href="https://www.who.int/news/item/06-12-2021-more-malaria-cases-and-deaths-in-2020-linked-to-covid-19-disruptions">sickened close to 241 million people in 2020</a> and killed 670,000 worldwide, mostly in Africa. Children 5 years old and younger accounted for about 80 percent of the continent’s malaria deaths, the World Health Organization says.</p>



<p>Because of malaria’s huge toll, large investments have been made to fight the disease, yielding preventive drugs, insecticide-treated bed nets and even malaria vaccines — one <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/2021-science-stories-updates-mosquitoes-malaria-tulsa-wildfires">was recently recommended for use in sub-Saharan Africa</a> (<em>SN: 12/18/21 &amp; 1/1/22, p. 32</em>). These efforts are helping. But mosquitoes are developing resistance to insecticides, and some anti-malaria drugs may no longer work well.</p>



<p>“To go toward zero [cases], we need to have something that is transformational,” says Fredros Okumu, a mosquito biologist and director of science at Ifakara Health Institute in Tanzania.</p>





<p>Gene drives might be the transformational answer people are looking for. Researchers are still refining and testing the technology, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/gene-drives-spread-their-wings">which was first devised in 2015</a> (<em>SN: 12/12/15, p. 16</em>). Though <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/genetically-modified-mosquito-test-california-epa-oxitec">other types of genetically altered mosquitoes</a> have been released in Brazil, the United States and elsewhere, those altered genes spread slowly among wild populations (<em>SN Online: 3/9/22</em>). Gene drives could potentially spread to nearly ever member of a species quickly, forever altering the species or wiping it out.</p>



<p>But whether gene drives ever play a role in combating malaria may depend as much on social considerations as on science.</p>



<p>“A technology doesn’t work by technical strength alone. It works because it embeds into a social context,” says Ramya Rajagopalan, a social scientist at the University of California, San Diego. In the past, scientists “developed a technology in the lab, got it all set up and ready to go, and then you go to the stakeholders and say, ‘Hey, we have this great technology, do you want to use it?’ ”</p>



<p>If people reject that sort of offer, as has happened with some genetically modified crops, researchers often think, “If [the public] only knew enough about the technology, they’d be more accepting,” Rajagopalan says. But more often the failure comes because the researchers “don’t include community voices from the outset in the design and the implementation.”</p>



<p>Because of the possibility of forever altering ecosystems, the European Union has already said “no” to using gene drives there. But Africa is where a gene drive might one day help defeat malaria. Researchers are hoping to eventually release gene drives on the continent, but must first get public consensus. To that end, scientists are looking for ways to involve members of the public in research, and learn about local priorities and how to talk about the technology.</p>

<h4>Rattling the cage</h4>



<p>No one is ready to let mosquitoes carrying gene drives out of the lab yet. For now, researchers are doing tests with mosquitoes in captivity to get an idea of whether the technology will work as planned. In the Terni cage trials, scientists used small rooms, setting humidity levels, lighting and other characteristics to mimic some of the conditions the mosquitoes might encounter in the wild.</p>



<p>In cages almost 5 cubic meters big — about the size of a small dressing room — containing hundreds of <em>Anopheles gambiae </em>mosquitoes, scientists added male members of the same species that carried the engineered change to their DNA.</p>



<p>The gene drive used for this experiment is built on the molecular scissors known as CRISPR/Cas9. Male mosquitoes are engineered to carry the gene drive, which consists of instructions for making the DNA-cutting enzyme Cas9 and an RNA that guides the enzyme to the gene to be cut. When an engineered male mates with an unaltered female, Cas9 snips a gene called <em>doublesex </em>inside the fertilized egg. As the egg tries to repair the cut, the gene drive from the father’s <em>doublesex</em> gene is pasted over the copy of the gene inherited from the mother. So the offspring gets two copies of the gene drive, instead of one.</p>



<p>Normally, any particular version of a gene has a 50 percent chance of being passed from parent to offspring. But with the copy-and-paste CRISPR system, gene drive–carrying mosquitoes pass the drive to about 96 percent of male progeny and more than 99 percent of females. With that genetic cheat, the gene drive spreads rapidly through the population.</p>



<div class="wp-block-sciencenews-content-sidebar alignwide">
<h3>Upping the odds&nbsp;</h3>



<p>With other forms of genetic engineering, the altered gene follows normal rules of inheritance and is passed on to only 50 percent of offspring. Gene drives can paste themselves into a gene inherited from an unaltered parent, ensuring the genetic change gets passed on more often.</p>

<p>The<em> doublesex</em> gene is essential for the development of female mosquitoes. When the gene doesn’t work, “the mosquito itself doesn’t work,” says Ruth Müller, chief ecologist and entomologist at the Institute of Tropical Medicine in Antwerp, Belgium. The gene drive breaks the gene.</p>



<p>Female offspring that inherit two copies of a broken <em>doublesex</em> gene develop mouthparts and genitalia that are closer to the male form. Those females are sterile, and they cannot bite people with their malformed mouthparts. Unable to bite, those mosquitoes can’t transmit malaria-causing parasites from their bodies to humans.</p>



<p>In those naturelike cages in Terni, when gene drive–carrying mosquitoes were introduced, the populations <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-021-24790-6">died out in 245 to 311 days</a>, researchers reported in July 2021 in <em>Nature Communications</em>. In two cages where no gene drive mosquitoes were added, mosquito populations lived normally to the end of the experiment.</p>



<p>This was the first proof that the gene drive might work under almost real-world conditions, says Müller, one of the study’s leaders. But there is still a lot to learn about drives, she says, including how they will affect mosquito populations in the wild, whether they can slow malaria’s spread and importantly, what the impact will be on other creatures in the environment.</p>



<p>Getting those answers will determine the feasibility of moving forward scientifically. They will also play a big role in whether the public agrees to releasing a tool that could intentionally drive a species toward extinction.</p>

<h3>Population crash&nbsp;</h3>



<p>In large cages with about 570 mosquitoes, researchers added about 70 gene drive–carrying males. As the gene drive spread, more females became sterile and egg production crashed (red and blue lines). The gene drives worked faster than computer simulations suggested (gray lines). In control cages with no gene drive, egg production continued as usual (horizontal dotted black line).</p>

<h4>Considering all possibilities</h4>



<p>While Müller’s and other Target Malaria science teams based in Africa, Europe and North America refine gene drives, other affiliated and independent groups are mapping out what releasing a gene drive could do to the planet. “Right now there are a lot of theoretical discussions,” Müller says. It’s important to gather data to “fill the debate with more facts” about the real risks and benefits, she says.</p>



<p>At least <a href="https://malariajournal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12936-021-03674-6">46 theoretical harms could arise from the use of gene drives on mosquitoes</a>, researchers reported in March 2021 in <em>Malaria Journal</em>. Those potential downsides include reductions in pollinators and other species directly or indirectly related to the disappearance of the mosquitoes. It’s possible that people could develop allergic reactions to the bite of mosquitoes carrying a single copy of the gene drive, or to fish that eat the altered mosquito larvae. There could be a decline in water quality caused by large numbers of mosquito larvae dying. There’s even a set of scenarios in which malaria cases increase if, for instance, mosquito species that are better malaria spreaders take over in areas where a gene drive has thinned out less-troublesome mosquitoes.</p>



<p>Dreaming up possible nightmare consequences was an exercise intended to tell researchers what they might need to plan for and test before releasing gene drive mosquitoes into the wild. At workshops held in 2016 through 2019 in Ghana, Kenya, Botswana, Gabon and the United States, researchers worked out a chain of events that might lead to each of those potential harms.</p>



<p>The list of 46 possibilities focused on four areas that African leaders said were most important to protect: biodiversity, human and animal health, and water quality. By identifying these hypothetical hazards, researchers can begin calculating the likelihood of a harm happening and how bad it could be, says report coauthor John Connolly, a senior regulatory scientist for Target Malaria who is based at Imperial College London.</p>



<p>“You probably never really finish a risk assessment, but you get a clearer understanding of the risks and uncertainties,” Connolly says. Target Malaria and independent groups hope to answer some questions by examining data collected from the release of genetically altered mosquitoes that don’t carry gene drives.</p>



<p>Studies of biological pest control mechanisms — such as releasing a predator to eradicate an invasive species (remember invasive cane toads in Australia [<em>SN Online: 10/14/14</em>]) — may also provide some clues about how gene drives may spread, says Keith Hayes, who leads a risk assessment team at the Commonwealth Science and Industrial Research Organization’s Data61 in Hobart, Australia.</p>



<p>Some questions may never truly be answered unless gene drives are released. Scientists can experiment and simulate what might happen, but “at some point you have to say, ‘We don’t know everything. We can’t know everything. There may be surprises,’ ” Hayes says. That’s when a decision will need to be made about a release based on what is known about the risks and benefits.</p>



<h4>High stakes</h4>



<p>Even if those evaluations reveal downsides to gene drives, the potential benefits for human health and economics may far outweigh the risks, Müller argues.</p>



<p>“If you have a high burden of malaria, that costs a lot,” Müller says. “Children cannot go to school. People cannot go to work. That should also be considered if you talk about costs.”</p>



<p>Opponents of gene drives say it’s unfair to paint rejection of the unproven, potentially dangerous, technology as dooming children to death from malaria. “We are already not saving those children with measures [that would help] such as improving sanitation and the medical system,” says Mareike Imken, the European coordinator of the Stop Gene Drives campaign. Her organization is <a href="https://www.stop-genedrives.eu/en/">calling for a global moratorium</a> on the release of gene drives until there is worldwide consensus on whether they are safe and necessary and how they should be regulated.</p>



<p>“We need the highest possible obstacle to using this high-risk … technology,” Imken says. Allowing gene drives to be tried against malaria would essentially unleash them for use against a wide variety of organisms, with potentially devastating ecological consequences, she says. Instead, the world should invest more in already proven methods of controlling and eradicating malaria.</p>



<p>But there are potential upsides to gene drives that current approaches, such as insecticides, don’t offer. “The stuff we have been doing for years has been intentionally designed to eradicate mosquitoes. It just didn’t do it. We’ve been spraying the hell out of them for years, and in the process killing a lot of other nontarget organisms,” Okumu says.</p>



<p>By replacing insecticides, gene drives might help save insects including bees, butterflies and other pollinators. And gene drives are designed to eliminate only the mosquito species that are dangerous, Okumu says. “Of all the 3,500 species … we need to target one, two, at maximum three of them.”</p>



<p>He’s referring to the handful of species in the <em>Anopheles </em>genus that are mostly responsible for spreading malaria. In Africa, the primary disease carriers are <em>Anopheles gambiae</em> and the look-alikes <em>An. arabiensis</em>, <em>An. coluzzii</em> and <em>An. funestus.</em></p>



<p>While eradicating malaria is the goal, making mosquitoes extinct is mostly hyperbole, says Tony Nolan, a molecular biologist at the Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine in England.</p>



<p>“Extinction is not a likely outcome, nor even a desirable one. It’s not necessary to make the mosquito extinct to eliminate malaria,” says Nolan, one of the Target Malaria researchers developing gene drives. Geographic isolation may enable the gene drive to eliminate a local population of mosquitoes but nothing further afield. Mutations can arise in the Cas9 or guide RNA, causing the drive to stop working. Or other things might limit its spread.</p>



<p>But what would happen to the environment if a major mosquito species suddenly disappeared? Some researchers are trying to measure the ecological contributions of <em>An. gambiae</em>, including whether males pollinate plants visited for nectar. As of now, the mosquitoes’ biggest known value is as food for predators. Birds, fish and other animals that eat mosquitoes or their larvae usually aren’t picky about which species is for dinner. Only one species of spider is known to prefer <em>Anopheles</em> mosquitoes over other kinds.</p>



<p>Okumu’s experience leads him to think the malaria carriers wouldn’t be missed much. In some parts of eastern Africa, including Okumu’s home village in Tanzania, a combination of factors including prolonged dry seasons and insecticide and bed net use pushed <em>An. gambiae</em> out. “We have not seen — maybe because we didn’t measure [well enough] — any ecological challenges associated with the disappearance of <em>Anopheles gambiae</em>,” he says.</p>



<p>The mix of malaria carriers can vary considerably depending on local conditions. In Burkina Faso in western Africa, for instance, two villages had different mosquito populations: In Bana, to the northwest of the city Bobo­-Dioulasso, about 90 percent of mosquitoes were <em>An. coluzzii</em> with <em>An. gambiae</em> <a href="https://malariajournal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12936-019-2747-5">making up 9 percent of the catch</a>, researchers reported in 2019 in <em>Malaria Journal</em>. But on the southeastern side of the city, in the village of Pala, <em>An. gambiae</em> dominated, making up about 84 percent of mosquitoes caught. <em>An. arabiensis</em> accounted for about 10 percent, and <em>An. coluzzii</em> was about 6 percent of the catch in Pala.</p>



<p>If <em>An. gambiae</em> disappeared, one of the other species would fill the vacuum, Okumu says. That could be a good thing if the replacements don’t bite people as much or are lousy at spreading malaria. It could also be worse if the balance shifts toward a more voracious people-biter that easily spreads the parasites.</p>

<h4>Community input</h4>



<p>Beyond the scientific hurdles, researchers must also get the public on board with releasing the technology. Without public support, even a gene drive that works perfectly could be a no-go.</p>



<p>Not everyone agrees on when and how to get input. Okumu worries that asking the public whether they want gene drives before scientists have answers to some of the most pressing questions could backfire. “I would rather we know the true benefits, the true risks and gain a consensus around it, and then start engaging the communities,” he says.</p>



<p>Waiting until all the answers are in hand is a flawed approach, says Lea Pare Toe, a social scientist at the Institut de Recherche en Sciences de la Santé in Bobo-Dioulasso. “We should listen to [the community] and develop the science together,” says Toe, who works with Target Malaria to engage local people in the research.</p>



<p>At Bana, researchers didn’t start out talking about gene drives, or even genetic modifications, Toe says. First, the team had to clarify the connection between mosquitoes and malaria. They also had to dispel myths, such as eating fatty foods or sweet fruit can cause the disease. After an intensive engagement campaign from 2014 through 2019, researchers <a href="https://malariajournal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12936-021-03929-2#Tab2">found that such false statements were far less accepted</a>, the researchers reported in October 2021 in <em>Malaria Journal</em>.</p>



<div class="wp-block-sciencenews-content-sidebar alignwide">
<h3>Fact vs. fiction&nbsp;</h3>



<p>Over five years, discussions with residents of Bana, Burkina Faso, cleared up some misconceptions about how malaria is transmitted. The talks were part of a Target Malaria effort to involve the community in plans to use genetically modified mosquitoes. </p>

<p>Once people are clear on the causes of malaria, Toe and colleagues introduce the idea of genetics, and how researchers want to alter mosquitoes to combat malaria. People are generally OK with the uncertainty of research, she says. But they want to know more.</p>



<p>Residents pose specific questions about mosquito biology and ask how researchers can possibly work with such small creatures. They often ask whether the genetic alterations that make the mosquitoes sterile will transfer to humans. People “love the details,” Toe says.</p>



<p>Sometimes, creative approaches are needed to get concepts across. For instance, Target Malaria planned a first stage — releasing genetically sterilized male mosquitoes that won’t diminish mosquito populations — to help researchers collect data on how genetically altered mosquitoes stack up to normal ones in the wild.</p>



<p>Before those altered mosquitoes were set free, the organization wanted to ensure that Bana residents had a deep understanding of the project. Local leaders suggested a play. The scientists wrote a script, but the actors, a local storyteller and other community members <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41599-022-01122-7">revised it to improve storytelling</a>. This helped forge an emotional connection with the audience, Toe and colleagues reported April 5 in <em>Humanities and Social Sciences Communications</em>.</p>

<p>Meanwhile in Tanzania, although reluctant to move too soon with the public, Okumu and colleagues talked with community leaders and surveyed residents of 10 villages in the southeastern part of the country, where very few people had heard about genetically modifying mosquitoes. The aim of this 2019 effort was to understand community perceptions, rather than ask permission. People were intrigued by the idea of gene drives, but they had concerns about whether the mosquitoes <a href="https://malariajournal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12936-021-03663-9#Tab2">would look and behave differently from local mosquitoes</a>, the team reported in March 2021 in <em>Malaria Journal</em>.</p>



<p>Community members were also skeptical that targeting just one type of mosquito would be enough to reduce malaria transmission or decrease mosquito bites enough to keep communities on board with the project. It would be better, they said, to get rid of all the biting mosquitoes.</p>



<p>In a separate study done in 2019, people in Uganda who were already familiar with gene drives expressed similar concerns. But those participants anticipated problems if the mosquitoes <a href="https://malariajournal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12936-021-03682-6">cross national borders into a country opposed to the release</a>, researchers reported in March 2021 in <em>Malaria Journal</em>. Researchers may have to seek permission to release gene drive mosquitoes on a multinational scale, instead of just getting local and national consent.</p>



<p>Gene drives may win hearts and minds because they will first be tried against disease-carrying mosquitoes “that are very, very much not beloved or charismatic or anything,” says developmental geneticist Kimberly Cooper of UC San Diego. “Do you know anyone who has sympathies for the mosquito? It’s probably the most hated animal on the planet.</p>



<p>“But there will always be people who are very concerned about genetically modified organisms and their release into the environment,” even if those organisms are mosquitoes, says Cooper, who is not involved with the malaria gene drive research but is developing a <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/crispr-gene-drive-mice-pest-control-one-step-closer-reality">gene drive to use as a research tool in mice</a> (<em>SN Online: 1/23/19</em>).</p>



<p>Still, the attraction of stamping out malaria is powerful. The benefits could be enormous. But whether they outweigh any environmental risks from the technology and whether the public will buy in to this radical approach remains to be seen.</p>



<p>“There are tons of unknowns,” Okumu says. “The question is, should we pursue it? If you ask me, it would be unethical not to.”</p>



<div class="wp-block-sciencenews-content-sidebar alignwide">
<h4>Vampire spiders might miss <em>Anopheles </em>mosquitoes … for a minute</h4>



<p>If gene drives wiped out swaths of malaria-carrying mosquitoes, perhaps the only creature that would mourn the loss is a species of jumping spider found in the Lake Victoria region of Kenya and Uganda.</p>



<p>The spiders, <em>Evarcha culicivora</em>, share the mosquitoes’ taste for human and animal blood. “This vampire spider is perhaps the only species we know is heavily dependent on these [mosquitoes],” says Fredros Okumu, a mosquito biologist and director of science at Ifakara Health Institute in Tanzania. He’s referring to <em>Anopheles</em> mosquitoes, a main malaria spreader in Africa.</p>



<p>Blood is a unisex perfume for the spiders. Adults that have recently feasted on blood are more attractive to the opposite sex. Blood also provides nourishment for adult and baby spiders.</p>



<p>But the spiders’ mouthparts are unable to pierce skin or hides, says Fiona Cross, an arachnologist at the University of Canterbury in Christchurch, New Zealand. Instead, the spiders wait for mosquitoes to siphon blood from a person or animal, then the spiders pounce on the flying blood bags . “We call them mosquito terminators,” she says.</p>

<p>While any blood-laden mosquito will do, <em>Anopheles </em>mosquitoes are <em>Evarcha</em>’s favorite, partly because of the mosquito species’ bottoms-up resting pose. While other mosquitoes rest with their abdomens parallel to a surface, <em>Anopheles</em> lift their rears into the air, especially helpful for baby spiders, which are able to creep under the tilted abdomen.</p>



<p>Baby spiders, which “basically resemble dots with eight legs,” scuttle under the mosquito, “leap up, grab the mosquito from underneath, and as the mosquito flies away, the little spiderlings hang on with their little fangs and have just enough venom to bring the mosquito down,” Cross says. “They have the feast of a lifetime.”</p>



<p>But that doesn’t mean gene drives would doom the spiders by eliminating large swaths of the mosquitoes, Cross says. “If <em>Anopheles</em> were wiped from the planet, I would say that the spiders could adapt.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/neutrinos-submarine-nuclear-weapons-fuel-particles">How neutrinos could ensure a submarine’s nuclear fuel isn’t weaponized</a></h4>

              
                <p>Nuclear submarines might provide rogue nations with a path to nuclear weapons. But neutrinos could help reveal attempts to go from boats to bombs.</p>



<p>Neutrinos, lightweight subatomic particles that are released from the reactors that power nuclear subs, could <a href="https://journals.aps.org/prl/accepted/10077Y76Yfd14b7286f46d002a03c5ccd979cb79b">expose the alteration or removal of the nuclear fuel</a> for nefarious purposes, physicists report in a paper accepted in <em>Physical Review Letters</em>. Crucially, this monitoring could be done remotely, while a submarine is in a port with its reactor shut off.</p>





<p>To ensure that countries without nuclear weapons don’t develop them, international inspectors monitor the use of many types of nuclear technology around the world. Nuclear submarines are particularly worrisome. Many use highly enriched uranium, a potent type of fuel that can be weaponized relatively easily. But submarines are protected from monitoring by a loophole. Unlike nuclear power plants, nuclear submarines are used for secretive military purposes, so physical inspections could infringe on a country’s national security.</p>



<p>“Neutrino-based methods can considerably reduce the intrusiveness by making measurements at a distance, without having to physically access the vessel,” says nuclear scientist Igor Jovanovic of the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor, who was not involved with the research.</p>



<p>These particles — specifically their antimatter variety, antineutrinos — stream in droves from operating nuclear reactors. The particles interact feebly with other matter, allowing them to pass through solid material, including a submarine hull. So a neutrino detector placed near a submarine could reveal what’s going on inside, say neutrino physicists Bernadette Cogswell and Patrick Huber of the Center for Neutrino Physics at Virginia Tech in Blacksburg.</p>



<p>Scientists have previously suggested using neutrinos to detect other nuclear misdeeds, such as <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/ghostly-antineutrinos-could-help-ferret-out-nuclear-tests">nuclear weapons tests</a> (<em>SN: 8/20/18</em>).</p>



<p>But submarines, often on the move, are hard to monitor with stationary instruments. When the vessels do sit in port, their nuclear reactors may be turned off. So the researchers came up with a solution: They’d look at neutrinos produced by the decays of varieties of chemical elements, or isotopes, that remain after a reactor shuts down. A detector located in the water about 5 meters underneath the sub’s reactor could measure neutrinos produced in decays of certain cerium and ruthenium isotopes. Those measurements would reveal if nuclear material had been removed or swapped out.</p>



<p>This method of monitoring a reactor that’s off is “very clever,” says physicist Ferenc Dalnoki-Veress of the Middlebury Institute of International Studies at Monterey in California.</p>



<p>But the idea would still require buy-in from each country to agree to detectors in submarine berths. “Something like this would be so much better if it wouldn’t require cooperation,” says physicist Giorgio Gratta of Stanford University.</p>



<p>Submarine monitoring may become more pressing in the near future. So far, all countries that have nuclear submarines already possess nuclear weapons, so the issue was hypothetical. But that’s set to change. The United States and the United Kingdom, two nuclear weapons states, <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/09/15/joint-leaders-statement-on-aukus/">announced last September</a> that they are entering into a cooperative security agreement with Australia and will help the country<strong>,</strong> a non-nuclear weapons state, acquire nuclear submarines.</p>



<p>There’s little suspicion that Australia would use these submarines as a cover for a nuclear weapons program. But “you still have to worry about the precedent that that sets,” Cogswell says. So, she says, monitoring nuclear submarines is newly important. “The question was how the heck to do that.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/glia-nerve-cells-brain-body-spleen-heart-lungs">Glial cells may take on big jobs in unexpected parts of the body</a></h4>

              
                <p class="has-drop-cap">In the theater of the brain, nerve cells have long been cast as the stars, bringing mental scenes to life with their electrical and chemical performances. Yet many of the cellular actors in the human brain are glial cells, presumably the supporting cast and behind-the-scenes stagehands.</p>



<p>In recent decades, though, accumulating evidence has shown that glia are not just minor players that keep the show running. They actually play starring roles in many of the brain’s most important acts, such as remembering, learning and thinking.</p>





<p>And the latest research points to a surprising new setting for the story of glia: outside the brain. Mysterious populations of glia reside in the heart, spleen, lungs and various other organs. But no one knows how they’ll fit into the plot. Early hints suggest the story is going to be riveting.</p>



<p>Already, tantalizing clues are rolling in about what these cells are doing. Glia appear to help regulate the heart’s beating, for instance. Glia in the spleen reside right between nerve cells and immune cells — a perfect spot to influence the connection between health and stress. Exactly what glia are up to in the lungs is unknown, but whatever it is seems important, early experiments suggest — mice with no lung glia die.</p>





<p>“The fact that now there are these new glial cell populations being discovered in unique organs will hopefully trigger a lot of lightbulbs,” says Sarah Ackerman, a neurobiologist at Washington University in St. Louis. Like most researchers who study glia, Ackerman focuses on glia inside the brain.</p>



<p>She sees big potential in the handful of new studies that look at far-flung glia. “There’s going to be a revelation that across all of these organs, there are specialized glia that are supporting the function of the neurons there, but also overall organ health.”</p>



<p>Understanding the roles of glia outside the brain could have big implications for human health, leading to better ways to treat heart disorders, immune system problems and even lung cancer, some scientists suspect.</p>



<p>“If we continue to ignore these cells, it’s only going to slow us down,” says Tawaun Lucas, a neuroimmunologist at Genentech in San Francisco. He recently uncovered details about glia in mouse spleens.</p>

<h3>A family affair</h3>



<p>In the brain, several types of glia keep things running. <strong>Microglia</strong> are immune cells that patrol for pathogens, help prune nerve cell connections and more. <strong>Oligodendrocytes</strong> coat nerve fibers in myelin, insulation that speeds messages. <strong>Astrocytes</strong> guide nerve cell growth, regulate blood flow and influence signals between neurons.</p>

<p>It’s too early to know how important glia outside the brain will turn out to be. Maybe these studies on glia represent a burgeoning new field of research. Or maybe the mystery is never solved. “The connection it’s going to have to the conventional world of glia as we know it remains to be seen,” says Bruce Ransom, a neurologist and neuroscientist at the City University of Hong Kong who is also an editor in chief of the scientific journal <em>Glia</em>.</p>



<p>Still, the potential plotlines of these newly described groups of glia are worth following. “We’re always looking for that little opening that you can enlarge and see something really important,” Ransom says. “That’s a possibility here.”</p>



<h4>Immune system meets nervous system</h4>



<p>Glia are named for glue, the sticky substance that exists solely to hold other, more important things together. In the brain, various glia do lots of supporting. Glia called astrocytes keep nerve cells fed. Microglia combat invaders. And oligodendrocytes insulate nerve wires with a fatty substance called myelin. But glia are now known to have much fancier jobs too, including changing the signals that pass between nerve cells, guiding the growth of nerve cells and pruning neural connections called synapses (<em>SN: 8/22/15, p. 18</em>).</p>



<p>Researchers have a good handle on the roles of some glia outside the brain. Enteric glia help the gut digest food, for instance, and a type of glia called Schwann cells, sisters to the brain’s oligodendrocytes, spread myelin on peripheral nerves to help speed signals along. In the skin, specialized <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.aax6452">Schwann cells kick off pain sensations</a>, scientists reported in <em>Science</em> in 2019. Less is known about glia in other organs, such as the spleen glia that intrigue Lucas. Naming these glia can be tricky, since the cells sometimes share similarities with multiple types of other glia. For now, these outsider glia are often lumped into one of two catchall categories, nonmyelinating Schwann cells or satellite glia.</p>

<p>Lucas started out as a neuroscientist at Stanford University, focusing on the brain. Then a mouse under a microscope shifted his attention. The mouse was genetically engineered so that its glia glowed green. As Lucas looked throughout the body, he saw green cells all over, including in the spleen, lymph nodes, kidney, liver and lungs.</p>



<p>His adviser at Stanford, neurologist Marion Buckwalter, was quickly captivated by the spleen glia. “I started reading about the spleen, and I thought, ‘This is really fascinating,’ ” she says. The spleen is packed with immune cells. Like many organs, the spleen also contains nerves that are part of the body’s sympathetic nervous system. This control system can dilate pupils, quicken heart rates and get the body sweating. Often called the “fight-or-flight system,” the sympathetic nervous system flies into action under threats, says Lucas, “whether you get kicked in the head, or are chased by a tiger or have stressful things going on at work.”</p>



<p>The sympathetic nervous system and the immune system converge in the spleen, and glia may be particularly important in this connection. Experiments with the mice revealed <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/glia.23993">big, complex glia in the spleen</a> right alongside message-sending nerve cell axons. And “just microns away, there are immune cells,” Buckwalter says. The spleen’s glia are perfectly positioned to communicate between the nervous system and the immune system, the researchers reported in 2021 in <em>Glia</em>.</p>



<p>By looking at the genetic instructions inside those glia found in the spleen, Lucas and colleagues showed that the spleen’s glia have the cellular equipment to speak the language of both immune cells and nerve cells: They can sense chemical signals made by immune cells <em>and</em> they can sense chemical signals sent by nerve cells. How these cells use this machinery is unknown, but the results position spleen glia to be important communicators. Until Lucas’ experiments, no one had any clues about the glia’s behavior, Buckwalter says.</p>



<p>The possibility of communication between glia, nerve cells and immune cells in the spleen “has potentially huge implications,” Buckwalter says. Stress and brain injuries such as strokes can harm the immune system. After a stroke, for instance, the sympathetic nervous system instigates a die-off of immune cells called B lymphocytes in the spleen, which can lead to dangerous infections. Immune cells also play a role in autoimmune disorders such as multiple sclerosis and rheumatoid arthritis, which can flare up in people who are stressed. If glia influence the immune cells, perhaps their behavior can be tweaked to prevent such flare-ups.</p>

<p>Research so far is preliminary. It’s not yet clear whether these spleen glia are in fact sending messages between the nervous system and the immune system, and if so, what the results of those conversations are. It’s too soon to say with any certainty that glia in people’s spleens are involved in autoimmune disorders, Buckwalter says. But the idea has piqued her interest.</p>



<p>Studying these mysterious cells in organs feels like a different sort of science, she says. It’s harder than just trying to find a missing piece of a puzzle. “It’s like we just got a puzzle, and the pieces aren’t labeled and the box has no picture on it.”</p>



<h4>The beating heart</h4>



<p>A similar puzzle can be found in the heart.</p>



<p>Cody Smith, who studies neural biology at the University of Notre Dame in Indiana, was well aware that the heart was packed with nerve cells. Most nerve cells are thought to have glia nearby, and Smith was eager to find the heart’s glia. Along with graduate student Nina Kikel-Coury, Smith went searching for them. “We really had no idea what to expect,” he says.</p>



<p>It turned out that a population of glia resides in the hearts of zebrafish. Named cardiac nexus glia, these cells appear early in zebrafish development and go on to spread out and form a gossamer-thin <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.3001444">web around the heart</a>, Smith and Kikel-Coury reported last year in <em>PLOS Biology</em>.</p>



<p>In zebrafish, at least, these glia do important work: They guide the development of the heart and regulate heartbeat. When the researchers messed with the cells, the fish’s heart rates increased. That’s an unusual effect, Smith says. Usually, disruptions to heart cells cause heart rates to slow.</p>

<p>By looking at other datasets that catalog the genes active in mouse and human heart cells, the researchers found cells that had similar collections of active genes to the heart glia in the zebrafish. <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.3001444">The shared genes</a> suggest that these glia may be in many species’ hearts. That data “support the idea that they’re in humans,” Smith says.</p>



<p>Some congenital heart disorders have defects in the outflow track of the heart, where blood exits to an artery. That’s also the spot that these glia first appear early in zebrafish development. It’s possible, Smith says, that these glia may be involved in human heart trouble. “We’re at such an early phase of this work,” he cautions. “I wish we had more answers.”</p>



<h4>The plot thickens</h4>



<p>Investigations of glia in the spleen and brain are just the beginning. Organs throughout the body may rely on glia, other research hints. Glia have <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4601129/">turned up in the lungs</a>, for instance, found there in mice by Buckwalter and Gabriela Suarez-Mier, a graduate student when the work was done.</p>



<p>Lung glia may be involved in breathing and oxygen exchange in capillaries, Lucas says, but details are slim. Those glia are crucial, Lucas’ preliminary experiments suggest: When researchers use a toxin to kill the glia in the lungs, “all of the animals die.”</p>



<p>In his current work, Lucas is studying glia’s potential role in cancer. Tumors in lungs (and also in the liver and pancreas) have nerves that attach to them, and glia wrap themselves around those nerves, Lucas says. In a lab dish, other researchers have found, <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25106646/#:~:text=Results%3A%20Schwann%20cells%20migrated%20toward,Schwann%20and%20pancreatic%20cancer%20cells.">Schwann cells will grow toward cancer cells</a>. So the behavior of glia that linger near a tumor is now an important question, Lucas says.</p>

<h3>Getting air</h3>



<p>In a mouse lung, glia (green) wrap around thick nerve bundles (<strong>a</strong>) that travel down the lung and meshlike nerves that surround large and small bronchi (<strong>b</strong> and <strong>c</strong>). Glia also wrap around blood vessel nerves (<strong>d</strong>) and small airways (<strong>e</strong>). This varied anatomy hints at some of the ways that lung glia might help with oxygen exchange.</p>

<p>Understanding the body’s glia and possibly enlisting them to fight disease will require more than a surface-level understanding. Techniques that reveal how individual cells use different collections of genes promise a deeper view of glia in the body. Other genetic labeling methods offer a way to monitor these mystifying glia in living animals. “The tools are going to allow us to go from, ‘OK, they’re there,’ to ‘What are they doing?’ ” says Ackerman, the neurobiologist at Washington University.</p>



<p>Glia biologists looking beyond the brain are still very much at the beginning of their script. “What cells are here and how do they work together?” Lucas asks. “We’re starting from square one.”</p>



<p>Being outside the brain puts these glia in a good position to be possible targets for therapies, Ackerman says. The brain is hard to reach with drugs, as it’s ensconced in its protective blood-brain barrier. Brain cells are also less able to repair themselves than cells in the peripheral nervous system. “We might be able to affect positive change in a more efficient way than trying to direct repair in the brain or the spinal cord,” she says.</p>



<p>It’s too soon to say whether glia outside the brain are part of the same story as the brain’s glia. The variety of glia residing outside the brain might all end up being individual bits of disparate biology, never coalescing into a plot that’s relevant for the entire nervous system, says Ransom, of the City University of Hong Kong. “I think it’s exciting and interesting work, and I think it’s completely justified to study it entirely,” he says. For now, there’s no telling where glia’s story will take us.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/supercomputer-exascale-frontier-speed-record-computing-calculations">The world’s fastest supercomputer just broke the exascale barrier</a></h4>

              
                <p>The first exascale computer has officially arrived.</p>



<p>The world’s fastest supercomputer performed <a href="https://www.top500.org/news/ornls-frontier-first-to-break-the-exaflop-ceiling/">more than a quintillion calculations per second</a>, entering the realm of exascale computing. That’s according to a ranking of the world’s speediest supercomputers called the <a href="https://www.top500.org/lists/top500/2022/06/">TOP500</a>, announced on May 30. The computer, known as Frontier, is the first exascale computer to be included on the biannual list.</p>



<p>Exascale computing is expected to allow for new advances in a variety of scientific fields that depend on vastly complex calculations. The exascale milestone “represents an unprecedented capability for researchers around the world to use the computer to ask their specific scientific questions,” says Frontier’s project director Justin Whitt&nbsp;of Oak Ridge National Laboratory in Tennessee.</p>





<p>Oak Ridge&#8217;s Frontier clocked in at about 1.1 exaflops, or 1.1 quintillion operations per second. Frontier beat out the previous record-holder, a supercomputer called Fugaku at the RIKEN Center for Computational Science in Kobe, Japan, which achieved more than 0.4 exaflops.</p>



<p>While <a href="https://www.hpcwire.com/2021/11/24/three-chinese-exascale-systems-detailed-at-sc21-two-operational-and-one-delayed/">tentative reports</a> have suggested that some Chinese supercomputers are already achieving exascale performance, they have not been reported on the TOP500 ranking so far.</p>



<p>After about three years of development, Frontier will be ready for scientists to begin using it at the end of 2022. With its new exascale capability, researchers aim to simulate how stars explode, calculate the properties of subatomic particles, investigate new energy sources such as nuclear fusion and harness artificial intelligence to improve the diagnosis and prevention of disease, among many other research topics.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/covid-dog-detection-pcr-test-screening-coronavirus">Trained dogs sniff out COVID-19 as well as lab tests do</a></h4>

              
                <p>Dogs are as reliable as laboratory tests for detecting COVID-19 cases, and may be even better than PCR tests for identifying infected people who don’t have symptoms. A bonus: The canines are cuter and less invasive than a swab up the nose.</p>



<p>In a study involving sweat samples from 335 people, trained dogs <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0268382">sniffed out 97 percent of&nbsp; the coronavirus cases</a> that had been identified by PCR tests, researchers report June 1 in <em>PLOS One</em>. And the dogs found all 31 COVID-19 cases among 192 people who didn’t have symptoms.</p>





<p>These findings are evidence that dogs could be effective for mass screening efforts at places such as airports or concerts and may provide friendly alternatives for testing people who balk at nasal swabs, says Dominique Grandjean, a veterinarian at the National School of Veterinary Medicine of Alfort in Maisons-Alfort, France.</p>



<p>“The dog doesn’t lie,” but there are many ways PCR tests can go wrong, Grandjean says. The canines’ noses also identified more COVID-19 cases than did <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coronavirus-covid-19-testing-questions-vaccines-variants-accuracy">antigen tests</a> (<em>SN: 12/17/21</em>), similar to many at-home tests, but sometimes mistook another respiratory virus for the coronavirus, Grandjean and colleagues found. What’s more, anecdotal evidence suggests the dogs can pick up asymptomatic cases as much as 48 hours before people test positive by PCR, he says.</p>



<p>In the study, dogs from French fire stations and from the Ministry of the Interior of the United Arab Emirates were trained in coronavirus detection by rewarding them with toys — usually tennis balls. “It’s playtime for them,” Grandjean says. It takes about three to six weeks, depending on the dog’s experience with odor detection, to train a dog to pick out COVID-19 cases from sweat samples.</p>



<p>The dogs then sniffed cones housing sweat samples collected from human volunteers’ underarms. Swabbing the sweat off the back of people’s necks or giving the woofers a whiff of used face masks worked just as well, Grandjean says.</p>



<p>Those results indicate that odors from multiple body sites can be used for canine screening, says Kenneth Furton, a forensic chemist at Florida International University in Miami who was not involved in the study.</p>



<aside class="wp-block-sciencenews-inline-related-post alignleft">
<h4>
<a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/editors-picks/2019-novel-coronavirus-outbreak">See all our coverage of the coronavirus outbreak</a>
</h4>
</aside>



<p>The results are similar to previous, smaller studies that also found that dogs perform as well as or even better than PCR tests for detecting SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, Furton says. He and colleagues have used dogs at schools, a music festival and in a small trial screening airline employees for coronavirus infections.</p>



<p>One of the biggest advantages dogs have over other tests is their speed, Furton says. “Even with what we call a rapid test, you’re still going to have to wait tens of minutes or even hours, where the dog in a matter of seconds or even fractions of seconds can make a response.”</p>



<p>It’s not clear exactly what dogs are smelling when they detect COVID-19 or other diseases, says Cynthia Otto, director of the University of Pennsylvania School of Veterinary Medicine’s working dog center, who was not involved in the study. It may not be a single chemical, but rather a pattern of increasing and decreasing levels of certain aromas. “It’s not like you could create an odor perfume bottle that would be the scent of COVID,” she says.</p>



<p>Even with repeated studies demonstrating dogs’ COVID-detection prowess, some doctors, scientists and government officials have been skeptical of the claims, Grandjean says. He finds the reluctance puzzling, because dogs are already used to sniff out drugs and explosives, and are being tested for detecting other diseases, such as cancer, he says. “Every time you take a plane, it’s because dogs have been sniffing your luggage [and found] no explosives. So you trust them when you take a plane, but you don’t want to trust them for COVID?”</p>



<p>One challenge with dogs, says Furton, is that people don’t think of them as high-tech the way electronic sensors are. “But dogs are one of the highest-tech devices we have. They’re just biological sensors, instead of electronic sensors,” he says.</p>



<p>Another drawback for dogs is that they take time to train and there currently aren’t even enough dogs trained to detect explosives, let alone diseases, Otto says. And “dogs that work well in that lab setting may not work well in a people setting,” she says. Handlers can also influence the dog’s response and must be able to read the dog well, she says. “We need more good dogs.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/sun-hedgehog-solar-orbiter-flare">The Solar Orbiter spacecraft spotted a ‘hedgehog’ on the sun</a></h4>

              
                <p>A spacecraft has spied a spiky “hedgehog” on the sun and watched a solar flare in ways never done before.</p>



<p>The Solar Orbiter, a collaboration between the European Space Agency and NASA, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/esas-solar-orbiter-will-be-the-first-spacecraft-to-study-the-suns-polar-zones">launched in February 2020</a> and is now looping around our star (<em>SN: 2/9/20</em>). On May 18, researchers released images from the spacecraft’s closest solar flyby yet. That flyby took place March 26 when the orbiter flew within about 48 million kilometers of the sun, closer than Mercury is.</p>





<p>“This is amazing to have this sort of data already,” says solar physicist David Berghmans of the Royal Observatory of Belgium in Brussels.</p>



<p>The observations show a feature nicknamed the hedgehog, due to its spikes of darker, cooler gas atop hotter material. “‘Cool’ is relative here, with respect to the 1-million-degree background [plasma],” says Berghmans, the principal investigator of the orbiter’s Extreme Ultraviolet Imager. The scientists don’t know what causes this feature, but think it’s related to <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/realigning-magnetic-fields-may-drive-sun-spiky-plasma-tendrils">long, thin jets of solar material called spicules</a> (<em>SN: 11/14/19</em>)<em>.</em></p>

<p>Several days before spying the 25,000-kilometer-wide hedgehog, four of Solar Orbiter’s instruments detected an X-ray flare and observed how it affected nearby space. This is what the spacecraft was built to do, Berghmans says.</p>



<p>The spacecraft’s focus is “connection science,” he says. Solar Orbiter’s instruments detected the solar flare, the shock wave it created and the produced burst of charged particles and radio signals — one after another — over several hours. Previously, different telescopes would detect these separately over days.</p>



<p>By connecting the sequence of events into “a complete story,” Berghmans says, scientists can better predict the outflows of those charged particles, which are especially dangerous to astronauts, satellites and even high-flying aircraft.</p>



<p>The spacecraft will pass close to the sun roughly every five to six months through 2026. Then, for three more years, the orbiter will swing closer to the sun’s poles, providing scientists with their first head-on views of those regions.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/great-white-sharks-megalodon-food-competition-extinction">Great white sharks may have helped drive megalodons to extinction</a></h4>

              
                <p>For millions of years, megalodon sharks were top ocean predators — and then came the great whites. New analyses of teeth hint that competition for food from great white sharks may have helped give the megatoothed giants an extra shove toward extinction.</p>



<p>Scientists reconstructed shark feeding habits by analyzing zinc in the teeth of 20 living shark species and 13 extinct species, including megalodons (<em>Otodus megalodon</em>). Megalodons and great whites <a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-022-30528-9">occupied a similar ecological niche</a>, devouring marine mammals such as whales and seals, the researchers report May 31 in <em>Nature Communications</em>.</p>





<p><em>O. megalodon</em> was one of the largest carnivores ever to live, growing to <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/newborn-megalodon-sharks-fossils-larger-most-adult-humans">at least 14 meters</a> long (<em>SN: 1/12/21</em>). This giant began menacing the oceans around 23 million years ago. When — and why — it went extinct isn’t clear. The species may have lingered until about 2.6 million years ago. Or it may have vanished <a href="https://peerj.com/articles/6088/">as early as 3.5 million years ago</a>, right around the time that the great white shark <em>Carcharodon carcharias</em> appeared.</p>



<p>To figure out if the two sharks dined on similar food, the researchers turned to zinc, which has two main forms: zinc-66 and zinc-64. The relative abundances of those isotopes, preserved in tooth enamel, can indicate an animal’s position in a food web. Plants — and plant eaters — are relatively high in zinc-66. Higher up the food chain, that 66-to-64 ratio decreases.</p>



<p>The analyses revealed that when and where <em>O. megalodon</em> and <em>C. carcharias</em> overlapped, the sharks had similar ratios. That finding suggests that their diets overlapped too, say geoscientist Jeremy McCormack of the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology in Leipzig, Germany, and colleagues.</p>



<p>Still, that the sharks consumed similar prey isn’t proof they were in competition, the researchers say. And there are many <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/what-meg-movie-gets-wrong-right-about-megalodon-sharks">factors that may have helped drive megalodons to extinction</a> (<em>SN: 8/10/18</em>). Those factors include ocean circulation changes, collapsing prey populations and competition for food with other ocean creatures, like orcas.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/wood-frog-mating-acoustic-camera">An ‘acoustic camera’ shows joining the right boy band boosts a frog’s sex appeal</a></h4>

              
                <p>Loud sounds matter in both car design and frog flirting.</p>



<p>So New Hampshire biologists lugged an acoustic camera used by car designers to springtime frog-mating pools to explore female preferences. Now researchers suspect that a male&#8217;s chances of becoming a dad depend in part on which pool&#8217;s boy band he belongs to.</p>



<p>We humans can name our own examples of ho-hum guys getting an allure boost from membership in the right group, says evolutionary biologist Ryan Calsbeek of Dartmouth College. “If Ringo Starr hadn’t been a Beatle…,” he muses. &nbsp;</p>





<p>An acoustic camera gives biologists <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/ele.14002?af=R">a new tool to explore the power of membership</a>, Calsbeek and colleagues wrote in the June <em>Ecology Letters</em>. Calsbeek credits Dartmouth colleague Hannah ter Hofstede, who has studied insect sounds and was not part of this study, with telling him about this industrial camera and its value to biologists. </p>



<p>The high-tech setup “looks a little like something you might find on a Mars rover,” he says. A hula hoop–like antenna on a pole holds stubby microphones feeding 48 independent channels of sound to location-calculating software. It uses the slight differences in when the same frog call reaches different microphones to calculate the frog’s location.</p>



<p>Calsbeek hauled camera gear and its substantial battery (sometimes “up 800 vertical feet with 90 pounds on my back”) to 11 early-spring rendezvous pools for wood frogs (<em>Rana sylvatica</em>). In a pool, eager males “generate this huge, chaotic gobbling sound” like a turkey flock. Calsbeek’s spirited imitations over the phone — imagine sort of half-swallowed honking sounds — indeed give a poultry vibe.</p>



<p>Wood frogs keep their species going in splashy, thrashing singles night–style crowds at these pools where males gather and females shop. The gatherings start early in the year, as <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/natural-antifreeze-prevents-frogsicles">wood frogs have the rare ability to survive cold</a> nestled here and there in leaf litter, in some latitudes literally freezing solid with a stopped heart (<em>SN: 8/21/13</em>). Once thawed back to life, they gather with other guys at a pool gobbling their little warmed-up hearts out waiting for females to find their way to the party.</p>



<p>Male wood frogs lack the anatomy to insert sperm. A dad-wannabe fights to grab a female and position himself tight against her so his sperm will reach eggs as she releases them. With a good grip then, a male turns frog mating from crowdsourcing into a couples’ event.</p>



<p>Such frantic grabby males can inadvertently drown females. So once a female hops into a mating pool, she may not have much choice about who fathers her offspring. However, the researchers wondered, in places with more than one pool, might she at least choose one bunch of grabby gobblers over another? Perhaps some features of the chorus help her decide.</p>



<p>Most of the vast research on mating preferences and flirtatious performances — <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/some-birds-chancy-climates-mean-better-singers">mockingbird</a>s singing, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/costas-hummingbirds-singing-tail-feathers">hummingbirds</a> swoop-diving, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/cricket-leaf-song-speakers-male-mating-call-competition">crickets</a> chirping and so on — looks at a single suitor showing off, usually for a female (<em>SN: 5/21/09; SN: 4/12/18; SN: 12/15/20</em>). Instead, Calsbeek’s team asked, “Does she have a favorite band?”</p>



<p>To see how a male’s membership in a group might give him a sex appeal bonus, the researchers created their own frog bands for females in the lab. Combining individual male’s serenades pulled from the trove of poolside recordings, the researchers made a variety of trios. Some had the overall pitch of shrill little guys; some were mostly rumbly bass performances, and some were mixed.</p>

</div><figcaption>In video from what’s called an “acoustic camera,” each blip of a rainbow blob in this New Hampshire pool pinpoints the location of a male wood frog who just gave his come-hither mating call. The colors correspond to the decibel scale at right. The male frogs gather in early spring to call (sounding to human ears like something between a human burp and a turkey gobble). To female wood frogs, though, it’s apparently a signal that males are available and eager for company.</figcaption></figure>



<p>The clearest outcome so far is that lab females seem to like chorus consistency itself, whether shrill in dominant pitch or deeper and rumbly. As a sign that this might be true outside the lab also, researchers typically found more of the jelly-gob egg masses, signs of mating success, floating in pools where choruses kept more consistent pitches.</p>



<p>The wood frog paper caught the attention of long-time frog researcher Michael Ryan of the University of Texas at Austin. Now he would like to know about the female side of these choruses, such as how far away a female can hear the pools she might approach.</p>



<p>The acoustic camera itself also intrigues Ryan, who was already window-shopping online as he answered journalist questions. For decades, he and colleagues have studied wild frog calls in harder and iffier ways. He would set out at least three fixed microphones to triangulate sound position ahead of a night’s chorusing. Then he’d hope the few males he could track showed up and didn’t switch places much. A movable acoustic camera with 48 sound inputs, he says, sounds “really cool.”</p>

                <p><em>By</em> <a href="https://twitter.com/mattbwarren">Matthew Warren</a></p>



<p>For many of us, the past two years have demonstrated <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2020/09/02/episode-21-how-to-stay-connected-in-the-new-normal/">how important the touch of others is</a> to our emotional wellbeing — and how hard it is to go without it. But in the absence of physical contact from other humans, could robots provide an adequate substitute?  Past work has found that robotic touch can elicit positive emotions in people — and now a <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-022-10503-6">new study</a> in <em>Scientific Reports </em>finds that the effect is better when the robots talk at the same time.</p>



<span id="more-46334"></span>



<p>Taishi Sawabe from Nara Institute of Science and Technology and colleagues tested the effects of robotic touch and speech on 31 Japanese volunteers. In some trials, participants received gentle strokes on their back from a robotic arm. In others, they heard a synthesised voice saying phrases caregivers might use, such as “Hello. How are you doing? Did you sleep well last night?” or “Hello. Please take care of yourself. It has been chilly these days”. And in a third kind of trial, they received the robotic touch and heard the robot speaking simultaneously.</p>



<p>After each trial, participants rated how positive or negative their mood was, as well as their emotional arousal (high arousal refers to feelings like excitement; low arousal to feelings like relaxation), and rated how human-like the robot was. The team also measured participants’ muscle activity in the facial muscles involved in smiling, and recorded their skin conductance, a measure of physiological arousal.</p>



<p>Participants reported an overall positive mood on trials where the robot touched them, and on trials where it talked to them — but crucially their mood was significantly <em>more</em> positive on trials where it did both simultaneously. They also showed greater activity in the facial muscles associated with smiling on these combined trials. There were no differences in participants’ feelings of arousal between trials, though they did have higher skin conductance on trials with both touch and speech than on trials with just speech. They also felt the robots were more human-like when they both talked and touched than when they just did one of these actions.</p>



<p>The findings could help to guide the design of robots made for people who suffer from a lack of human touch — elderly people living alone, for instance. More than a quarter of Japan’s population is over 65 years old, and there are not enough care workers to meet the needs of the ageing population. Greater use of robots <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-022-00072-z">has been touted as one solution</a>.</p>



<p>There are various limitations to the study, however. It’s unclear whether an immediate boost in mood from an interaction with a robot translates to lasting effects, for instance, and whether personality or demographic differences could affect how people respond to the robots. And although it seems fairly uncontroversial to suggest that robots could be used to help with household tasks or medical care, there are practical and ethical questions about relying on machines to satisfy human psychological needs, particularly for people who are elderly or lonely. Still, if robots are to be commonplace in these kinds of settings, it’ll be important to know how to make them most effective.  </p>

Herrera-Castillo of the Autonomous University of Madrid and colleagues analyzed a set of unusual dinosaur footprints found in Spain. The study presents evidence of abnormalities in the footprint due to an injured toe, causing the dinosaur to have an atypical gait in response to the injury. Learn more about the study design and the authors&rsquo; findings below or jump to the <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0264406">full study</a> on our journal site.</p>



<h3><strong>Background and analysis</strong></h3>



<p>Fossil trackways are an excellent source of information on the behavior of extinct animals. In the study, researchers examined an abnormal trackway comprising six footprints from an unidentified theropod dinosaur preserved at the Las Hoyas Locality in Spain, dating to around 129 million years ago. The authors used a variety of techniques to describe and model the tracks and to compare them to other trackways.&nbsp;</p>



<h3><strong>Findings</strong></h3>



<p>The authors observed that the tracks made by the right foot display all three toes, but that the innermost toe on the left foot is represented only by extremely short and irregularly shaped markings in the sediment, indicating an injury or deformity in that toe. Furthermore, the footprints are spaced more widely than typical theropod tracks, indicating that this dinosaur adjusted its gait to compensate for its injured foot. This is further supported by certain deformations in the right footprints which suggest the animal was putting more weight on that side.</p>



<h3><strong>Conclusion</strong></h3>



<p>The authors note that similar toe deformities and similar compensating behaviors are also seen in modern birds and that fossil theropod feet are often found with injuries on the innermost toes. Taken altogether, this evidence sheds light on how this dinosaur, and perhaps many others, found ways to survive despite pathological setbacks.</p>



<p>The authors add: &ldquo;We studied one of the best theropod trackway with a foot deformity, printed in a microbial mat that grew in a 129 Ma pond, when hundreds of fish were swimming around.&rdquo;</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/hurricane-season-testing-extreme-wind-water-conditions">Scientists hope to mimic the most extreme hurricane conditions</a></h4>

              
                <p>Winds howl at over 300 kilometers per hour, battering at a two-story wooden house and ripping its roof from its walls. Then comes the water. A 6-meter-tall wave engulfs the structure, knocking the house off its foundation and washing it away.</p>



<p>That’s the terrifying vision of researchers planning a new state-of-the-art facility to re-create the havoc wreaked by the most powerful hurricanes on Earth. In January, the National Science Foundation awarded a $12.8 million grant to researchers to design a facility that can simulate wind speeds of at least 290 km/h — and can, at the same time, produce deadly, towering storm surges.</p>





<p>No facility exists that can produce such a one-two punch of extreme wind and water. But it’s an idea whose time has come — and not a moment too soon.</p>



<p>“It’s a race against time,” says disaster researcher Richard Olson, director of extreme events research at Florida International University, or FIU, in Miami.</p>



<p>Hurricanes are being made worse by human-caused climate change: They’re getting bigger, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/how-climate-change-fueling-hurricane-florence">wetter</a>, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/climate-hurricanes-landfall-lingering-longer-staying-stronger">stronger and slower</a> (<em>SN: 9/13/18</em>; <em>SN: 11/11/20</em>). Scientists project that the 2022 Atlantic Ocean hurricane season, spanning June 1 to November 30, will be the seventh straight season with more storms than average. Recent seasons have been marked by <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/climate-change-wildfires-heat-waves-hurricanes-records-2020">an increase in rapidly intensifying hurricanes</a> linked to warming ocean waters (<em>SN: 12/21/20</em>).</p>



<p>Those trends are expected to continue as the Earth heats up further, researchers say. And coastal communities around the world need to know how to prepare: how to build structures — buildings, bridges, roads, water and energy systems — that are resilient to such punishing winds and waves.</p>



<p>To help with those preparations, FIU researchers are leading a team of wind and structural engineers, coastal and ocean engineers, computational modelers and resilience experts from around the United States to work out how best to simulate these behemoths. Combining extreme wind and water surges into one facility is uncharted territory, says Ioannis Zisis, a wind engineer at FIU. “There is a need to push the envelope,” Zisis says. But as for how exactly to do it, “the answer is simple: We don’t know. That’s what we want to find out.”</p>



<h4>Prepping for “Category 6”</h4>



<p>It&#8217;s not that such extreme storms haven’t been seen on Earth. Just in the last few years, Hurricanes Dorian (2019) and Irma (2017) in the Atlantic Ocean and super Typhoon Haiyan (2013) in the Pacific Ocean have brought storms with wind speeds well over 290 km/h. Such ultraintense storms are sometimes referred to as “category 6” hurricanes, though that’s not an official designation.</p>



<p>The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, or NOAA, rates hurricanes in the Atlantic and eastern Pacific oceans on a scale of 1 to 5, based on their wind speeds and how much damage those winds might do. Each category spans an increment of roughly 30 km/h. &nbsp;</p>



<p>Category 1 hurricanes, with wind speeds of 119 to 153 km/h, produce “some damage,” bringing down some power lines, toppling trees and perhaps knocking roof shingles or vinyl siding off a house. Category 5 storms, with winds starting at 252 km/h, cause “catastrophic damage,” bulldozing buildings and potentially leaving neighborhoods uninhabitable for weeks to months.</p>



<p>But 5 is as high as it gets on the official scale; after all, what could be more devastating than catastrophic damage? That means that even monster storms like <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/hurricane-dorian-slow-pace-dangerous-predictions-hard">2019’s Hurricane Dorian</a>, which flattened the Bahamas with wind speeds of up to nearly 300 km/h, are still considered category 5 (<em>SN: 9/3/19</em>).</p>



<p>“Strictly speaking, I understand that [NOAA doesn’t] see the need for a category 6,” Olson says. But there is a difference in public perception, he says. “I see it as a different type of storm, a storm that is simply scarier.”</p>



<p>And labels aside, the need to prepare for these stronger storms is clear, Olson says. “I don’t think anybody wants to be explaining 20 years from now why we didn’t do this,” he says. “We have challenged nature. Welcome to payback.”</p>



<h4>Superstorm simulation</h4>



<p>FIU already hosts <a href="https://cee.fiu.edu/research/facilities/wall-of-wind">the Wall of Wind</a>, a huge hurricane simulator housed in a large hangar anchored at one end by an arc of 12 massive yellow fans. Even at low wind speeds — say, around 50 km/h — the fans generate a loud, unsettling hum. At full blast, those fans can generate wind speeds of up to 252 km/h — equivalent to a low-grade category 5 hurricane.</p>



<p>Inside, researchers populate the hangar with structures mimicking skyscrapers, houses and trees, or shapes representing the bumps and dips of the ground surface. Engineers from around the world visit the facility to test out the wind resistance of their own creations, watching as the winds pummel at their structural designs.</p>

<p>It’s one of eight facilities in a national network of laboratories that study the potential impacts of wind, water and earthquake hazards, collectively called the <a href="https://beta.nsf.gov/funding/opportunities/natural-hazards-engineering-research-infrastructure-nheri">U.S. Natural Hazards Engineering Research Infrastructure</a>, or NHERI.</p>



<p>The Wall of Wind is designed for full-scale wind testing of entire structures. Another wind machine, hosted at the University of Florida in Gainesville, can zoom in on the turbulent behavior of winds right at the boundary between the atmosphere and ground. Then there are the giant tsunami- and storm surge–simulating water wave tanks at Oregon State University in Corvallis.</p>



<p>The new facility aims to build on the shoulders of these giants, as well as on other experimental labs around the country. The design phase is projected to take four years, as the team ponders how to ramp up wind speeds — possibly with more, or more powerful fans than the Wall of Wind’s — and how to combine those gale-force winds and massive water tanks in one experimental space.</p>



<p>Existing labs that study wind and waves together, albeit on a much smaller scale, can offer some insight into that aspect of the design, says Forrest Masters, a wind engineer at the University of Florida and the head of that institution’s NHERI facility.</p>



<p>This design phase will also include building a scaled-down version of the future lab as proof of concept. Building the full-scale facility will require a new round of funding and several more years.</p>



<p>Past approaches to studying the impacts of strong wind storms tend to use one of three approaches: making field observations of the aftermath of a given storm; building experimental facilities to re-create storms; and using computational simulations to visualize how those impacts might play out over large geographical regions. Each of these approaches has strengths and limitations, says Tracy Kijewski-Correa, a disaster risk engineer at the University of Notre Dame in Indiana.</p>



<p>“In this facility, we want to bring together all of these methodologies,” to get as close as possible to recreating what Mother Nature can do, Kijewski-Correa says. &nbsp;</p>



<p>It’s a challenging engineering problem, but an exciting one. “There’s a lot of enthusiasm for this in the broader scientific community,” Masters says. “If it gets built, nothing like it will exist.”</p>

<p>It takes dedication to keep up with the scientific literature. 2344 papers were accepted at last year’s NeurIPS conference. Who has time to read all of that? It’s difficult to see the forest from the trees as ever more research is published.</p>



<p>What if every single one of us had infinite access to world experts in any field of field of study?They could recommend papers to read, based on:</p>



<ul><li>relevance</li><li>accuracy</li><li>importance &amp; novelty</li></ul>



<p>In this essay, I’ll try to convince you that we’re not far off from that world. Advances in natural language processing (NLP) and large language models (LLMs) mean that it’s becoming possible for machines to understand natural language, including the prose in scientific papers. We have only started to see these advances deployed, but my bet is that it will change how we consume and create science over the next few years. Let me recap the progress in NLP over the last 5 years and paint a vision of scientific natural language processing in the near future.</p>

<h2>NLP works and it’s commoditized</h2>



<p>I last looked seriously at NLP 5 years ago, and back then, it didn’t really work except for narrow use cases. Seeing recent results from PaLM and DALL-E 2 motivated me to pick a book on NLP and apply it to a semantic search project. In that 5 years, the field has completely changed. Let’s recap.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://xcorr.files.wordpress.com/2022/05/untitled-1-2.png"><img data-attachment-id="7939" data-permalink="https://xcorr.net/2022/05/30/large-language-models-will-change-science/untitled-1-2-2/" data-orig-file="https://xcorr.files.wordpress.com/2022/05/untitled-1-2.png" data-orig-size="1280,710" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="untitled-1-2" data-image-description="" data-image-caption="" data-medium-file="https://xcorr.files.wordpress.com/2022/05/untitled-1-2.png?w=300" data-large-file="https://xcorr.files.wordpress.com/2022/05/untitled-1-2.png?w=723" src="https://xcorr.files.wordpress.com/2022/05/untitled-1-2.png?w=1024" alt="" class="wp-image-7939" srcset="https://xcorr.files.wordpress.com/2022/05/untitled-1-2.png?w=1024 1024w, https://xcorr.files.wordpress.com/2022/05/untitled-1-2.png?w=150 150w, https://xcorr.files.wordpress.com/2022/05/untitled-1-2.png?w=300 300w, https://xcorr.files.wordpress.com/2022/05/untitled-1-2.png?w=768 768w, https://xcorr.files.wordpress.com/2022/05/untitled-1-2.png 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><figcaption>Cover of the latest O’Reilly book on NLP and Hugging Face</figcaption></figure>



<p>TL;DR: NLP now works. It’s also heavily commoditized. Anybody with a technical skillset–and increasingly non-technical people–can train a model to solve any number of NLP tasks. Some of the biggest changes are that:</p>



<ul><li>We have Transformers, a neural net architecture that scales well and can deal with large temporal contexts. The models vary from encoder-only, like the famous BERT model, decoder-only, like GPT-3, and encoder-decoder models like ones used for translation.</li><li>We have powerful pre-training tasks, especially masked language modelling, to pre-train large scale models that are useful for a number of tasks.</li><li>Models have been scaled tremendously and now routinely number in the 100 billion parameter range, and increasingly are trained on a significant subset of all the text on the internet.</li><li>The fundamental paradigm for adapting to specific tasks has changed. We now routinely use pretrained models either as is, with in-context learning, or we refine pre-trained models. This is far cheaper, less burdensome, and scales better than training a model from scratch.</li></ul>



<p>With these advancements in NLP models and training paradigms, the tooling has become far better:</p>



<ul><li>HuggingFace is essentially building Github for transformer models; anybody can download one of over 10,000 pretrained models, and either use them as is or fine-tune them on their own data.</li><li>Access to datasets is far easier as well, again through HuggingFace.</li><li>Access to hardware is commoditized. Anybody can rent a supercomputer with 320 GB of GPU RAM for 30$ an hour.</li><li>If one doesn’t want to bother with training and deploying models by themselves, they can use APIs which abstract away all the messiness, including OpenAI’s GPT or cohere.</li></ul>



<p>What do I mean when I say that the models now <em>work</em>? There are a number of tasks which we now know how to handle, provided that we have a sufficient amount of data:</p>



<ul><li>classification of single sentence, for instance to evaluate emotional tone or valence</li><li>named entity recognition, e.g. extracting the names of compounds, companies and people from text</li><li>extractive question answering, figuring out which passage in a document is relevant to answering a question. For example, extracting the name of the first prime minister of a country from its Wikipedia article</li><li>document embedding and semantic search, e.g. finding other relevant documents from a seed document</li><li>summarization, i.e. generating a short summary of a paragraph or document</li><li>translation, e.g. from English to French or Python to C++</li><li>autocomplete, including autocompleting code</li><li>text generation, including steered text generation, e.g. generate convincing ad copy for a product from a list of features</li></ul>



<p>That’s a long laundry list, but what is the relevance to how we do science?</p>



<h2>Scientific NLP can ease information overload</h2>



<p>Let’s go back to our initial thought experiment, having access to a world expert advisor to help us navigate the scientific literature. Because NLP now works and it’s highly commoditized, we’re starting to see scientific natural language processing being scaled up into real products.</p>



<h3>Determining relevance</h3>



<p>If you have a list of papers you have written, or a list of papers which you’ve identified as relevant to something you’re interested in, it’s becoming straightforward to find other relevant papers in that vein. Relevance can be determined from a number of signals, in particular semantic similarity as well as citation graph.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/allenai/specter">A prototypical work in this space is SPECTER</a>, a system from the Allen AI institute to find semantically related papers. A BERT-like model is pretrained on a masked language modeling task on unlabeled scientific texts (SciBERT): words are blanked out at random and the transformer is trained to find the missing word. This gives rise to one vector per token, in this case a 768-dimensional one. The tokens are then summarized, in this case extracting the vector of the special first token, although you could also take the average of tokens over a document.</p>

<p>The pre-trained network is then fine-tuned on a set of papers with a triplet loss: it moves similar papers together and dissimilar papers away from each other. Citations are used as a proxy signal for similarity: make papers which cite each other close to each other, and papers that don’t cite each other farther away. The result is a model that can generate fixed-length dense semantic vectors from each document. This can be used to retrieve similar documents, by finding other documents which are close together in this high-dimensional vector space.</p>



<p>Don’t Google Scholar, Mendeley, etc. already do recommendations? Yes, of course. However, consider these other uses of NLP in this context:</p>



<ul><li>You can use a question as the seed document. That means you can ask a question in natural language and obtain a ranking of relevant documents that answer this question. That means you can do a search in a field that’s completely unknown to you and obtain good starting documents.</li><li>The search engine can summarize a document for you. At a glance, you can figure out what a recommended document is about and select it for further reading. An example of such a system is <a href="https://github.com/allenai/scitldr">AllenAI’s TLDR</a>, an extreme summarization method. You can see this in action on <a href="https://elicit.org/search">elicit.org</a> and on <a href="https://www.semanticscholar.org/">Semantic Scholar</a>.</li><li>You can get the language model to tell you why it chose a given document. For instance, you can ask GPT-3 to tell you why document A is relevant to document B, and oftentimes the answers are quite reasonable. When I asked GPT-3 to explain why someone interested in a famous paper comparing deep nets to brains would be interested in another paper on it, it answered quite reasonably that “they are both about the ventral visual stream and object recognition”. It’s not very precise but it’s tantalizingly close to “getting it”, and the gap will most likely continue to decrease in the future.</li></ul>

<p>Recommendation systems can also be used to find new collaborators, matching students and postdocs to PIs, and students about to graduate to industry jobs. That means less friction in science and more opportunities for all.</p>



<h2>Determining accuracy</h2>



<p>It’s easy to grasp the value of semantic search: “what if we had Google for science, but better?”. However, this only scratches the surface of NLP’s potential uses for science. Consider determining the accuracy of a paper. There are many features of documents relating to trust and accuracy that are tedious for a human reader or reviewer to go through. These include:</p>



<ul><li>Is prior literature represented fairly and citations correct? Especially in the intro, the prior art can presented in non-exhaustive, biased ways, over-citing one’s own prior work, misrepresenting consensus or lack thereof, etc. Furthermore, authors may cite bad papers as evidence: citing underpowered, flashy or controversial papers without introducing proper caveats. Assuming we had a good semantic search engine (previous section) and a pre-existing trust system (this section), this could be automated.</li><li>Are the methods complete? If I took a result from a paper, and I wanted to recreate it, is it mentioned how that result was generated? Extractive Q&amp;A can help find relevant passages in the methods.</li><li>Are the methods appropriate? <a href="http://statcheck.io/">There are already crawlers for papers that alert authors to statistical issues</a>. This is a logical continuation of such efforts. Is the study prospective? Retrospective? Was a power analysis run? Are there enough subjects? Are the methods similar to those of other papers in that field? Are those papers trustworthy?</li><li>Are the claims substantiated? Entailment is an NLP task where one compares two statements and verifies that one follows another. One can build a whole statement tree and see whether the argument holds together. The more holes in the argument, the less trustworthy the papers.</li><li>Is the abstract representative of what’s in the paper? So many times you see papers where the abstract sounds awesome but the paper doesn’t substantiate its claims. With the claim tree resolved we can verify the representativeness of the abstract.</li><li>Is the paper plagiarized?</li><li>Is the paper written by authors who tend to write bad papers?</li></ul>



<p>Now imagine having a trustworthiness score for each paper, with attribution for which passages are dubious and which are trustworthy. This would be immensely helpful for reviewers and readers, and perhaps a good learning tool for students so they can understand how to strengthen their papers.</p>



<h2>Importance and novelty</h2>



<p>We have tools for determining importance and novelty:</p>



<ol><li>Prestige journals.</li><li>Affiliation.</li><li>Social media.</li></ol>



<p>I think everyone is starting to understand why <a href="https://neural-reckoning.org/reviewing.html">prestige journals are a bad idea</a>: prestige journals take money from taxpayers and put them into the pocket of shareholders that neither do research nor do much to advance science. In fact, they actively create barriers to science by placing it behind paywall. They have odious profit margins and extract free labor out of an exploited population (scientists). They delay publication by months, the judgement is extremely noisy, and those papers which do end up being published are more likely to be wrong than those in a less prestigious journal.</p>



<p>Affiliation is much the same way. Sure, if you see a paper from a Harvard researcher or a Nobel prize winner you’re more likely to read it. But affiliation, like prestige publication, suffers from the safe defects: it distorts the marketplace of ideas and leaves very good science from non-Ivy-League schools unread.</p>



<p>Social media is a bottom-up way of measuring importance and novelty of new work, and indeed, <a href="https://www.altmetric.com/">altmetric</a> has built a business around measuring this buzz. There is signal there. However, having a very critical part of science diffusion in the hands of private corporations whose core mission is not science is risky in the long-term. Science Twitter could get disrupted by global algorithmic changes on the platform. For example, a higher focus on comments as a metric – algorithmic engagement – might surface less papers and more recurring debates in your feed; less signal, more noise. The reality is that science Twitter is just a very small, poorly monetizable, insignificant part of Twitter as a whole, and its continued healthy existence could very much change.</p>



<p>None of the existing methods fully satisfy the core needs of the scientist as consumer: to see new developments in areas close to their area of research in realtime. Neither do they satisfy the needs of the scientist as producer: to have a fair chance of their science being read and fairly evaluated for what it is.</p>



<p>How can NLP help? There is some work <a href="https://paperswithcode.com/task/citation-prediction/codeless">attempting to predict future citations based off of different factors, a potential measure of importance and novelty</a>. Some factors like the shape of the citation graph (e.g. citing papers from two different, disconnected areas of science) can be predictive of novelty. Perhaps it will take a truly deep understanding of the scientific literature to gauge that a new paper is revolutionary, but in the next 2-5 years I can easily see more modest goals being achieved:</p>



<ol><li>sift through the literature to give you papers that are relevant to you, giving you short summaries of these documents</li><li>warn you if a new paper is likely unreliable because of its methods</li><li>free up time so you can deep dive into relevant papers with potential, and decide for yourself whether it is important</li></ol>



<p>A platform that facilitates goals 1 and 2 could be an ideal location to start a science-focused social medium. The captured data could be used to build models to predict importance over the long term.</p>



<h2>The road ahead</h2>



<p>The vision I outlined here is fairly short-term. A great resource to get an idea of the next 5 years of science and NLP is <a href="https://airtable.com/shrzC11Yi3JpIuVOk/tblObNwfhva0GJYLa?backgroundColor=gray">the published roadmap from elicit.org’s parent org</a>, <a href="http://ought.org">ought.org</a>. Another source of inspiration is the <a href="https://scinlp.org/">abstracts submitted to the scinlp conference</a>. These are glimpses of the near future.</p>

<p>Medium-term, I expect that the switch will flip, and that scientific research will be consumed more by computers than humans. Meta-analyses and review papers are already based on distilling existing data, and we can foresee that computers will be far more agile in creating texts that require distilling hundreds, if not thousands of source documents. There will eventually come a time where LLMs or their successors will be able to generate new scientific discoveries through distillation. It might not happen just right now, but certainly science will look far different in 10 years for this reason.</p>



<p>I also expect that large language models, embodied as assistants, will be <a href="https://erikhoel.substack.com/p/why-we-stopped-making-einsteins?s=r">excellent tutors</a>. If a computer understood your learning path, they could become the perfect tutor, feeding you just the thing you need to learn at the time you need it. Both humans and machines will be far more capable as a consequence. It’s up to us to make sure this future is also fair and accessible to all.</p>

                <p><em>By</em> <a href="https://twitter.com/mattbwarren">Matthew Warren</a></p>



<p>If you’ve been on social media at all in the last decade, you may have noticed it becoming an increasingly toxic environment. Antisocial language is on the rise — but not only among the general public. An <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/19485506221083811?journalCode=sppa">analysis of hundreds of thousands of tweets</a> from US Members of Congress has found that the language in their posts has become more and more rude and disrespectful since 2009. And this seems to be because uncivil tweets are rewarded with more retweets and likes, a finding that highlights the perverse incentives driving the way we communicate with each other on social media.</p>



<span id="more-46323"></span>



<p>The researchers, led by Jeremy Frimer from the University of Winnipeg, collected all the tweets made by Members of Congress between 2009 and 2019. To measure how civil the tweets were, they used Perspective API, a tool that scores language on a scale from 0 to 100 based on how likely it is that someone would find it rude or disrespectful. The researchers also analysed the tweets from the two presidents in office over this period — Barack Obama and Donald Trump — as well as from one million random Twitter users who were not politicians.</p>



<p>The researchers found that the average incivility score of the politicians’ tweets rose by 23% across the period, from 11.8 in 2009 to 14.5 in 2019. Incivility in the general public’s tweets rose as well, from a score of 21.1 in 2009 to 27 in 2019 — but the increase in uncivil language among politicians was independent of this more general increase.</p>



<p>The rise in incivility was greater for more partisan Members of Congress compared to more moderate ones; it was particularly prominent among liberal Democrats, apparently due to these politicians responding to uncivil tweets by Donald Trump in a similar tone. But these factors couldn’t fully explain the overall rise in incivility. Similarly, the increase in disrespectful language couldn’t be explained by changes in the make-up of Congress over the decade.</p>



<p>Instead, the team found that politicians were essentially being rewarded for sending rude tweets. Extremely uncivil tweets — those that scored 100 on the scale — received on average ten times as many retweets and eight times as many likes as extremely civil ones. And this response to extremely uncivil tweets became greater over the decade: in 2009 they only received about twice as many retweets as civil ones, but by 2019 they were getting 15 times as many retweets.</p>



<p>Further analysis showed that after getting lots of retweets or likes for an uncivil tweet, politicians’ subsequent tweets were more likely to be uncivil. Overall, then, it seemed that politicians were getting positive reinforcement from sending out uncivil tweets, making them more likely to use uncivil language in the future. And the extent of this positive feedback increased as the decade went on.</p>



<p>The team also found that the rise in incivility was unique to social media: members of Congress didn’t show a similar increase in uncivil language on the floor of the House. The researchers argue that the novel way in which Twitter provides social feedback is to blame. Retweets and likes aren’t necessarily a sign of approval: people may retweet rude tweets because they find them entertaining, for instance, not because they actually like the content. But politicians (and the rest of us!) may see these shares as positive feedback to be pursued.</p>



<p>These findings are consistent with other work illustrating how antisocial language is reinforced on social media platforms. Another US study found that <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2021/07/28/social-media-posts-that-are-hostile-towards-political-opponents-get-more-shares/">politicians receive more social media shares when they use negative language</a>, and in particular when they are hostile towards their opponents. Similar mechanisms shape online discourse among the general public too: for example, research has shown that <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2021/09/27/liking-outraged-posts-encourages-people-to-express-more-outrage-in-the-future/">“liking” outraged posts encourages people to express outrage again in the future</a>.</p>



<p>The one optimistic note is that although incivility did increase over time, by 2019 the politicians’ tweets were still not that uncivil overall, scoring only 14.5 on a 100-point scale. Even Trump’s tweets were more civil, on average, than those of the general population. However, that modest increase is overshadowed by the fact that the most uncivil tweets are the ones that are most likely to get shared and seen widely.</p>



<p>And unless something is done about social media’s perverse incentives, it’s likely that the problem will continue to get worse, the researchers write. “In light of the established deleterious effects that political incivility has on tolerance for alternative viewpoints and public trust in the political process … this rise is likely to have negative effects on American democracy and governance,” they conclude.</p>

Usually, hijacked journals mirror legitimate journals without permission from the original journal. In rare instances, publishers will buy rights to a legitimate journal but continue the publication under considerably less stringent publishing protocols and without clearly &#8230; <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2022/05/29/want-to-know-whether-that-journal-is-scamming-you-introducing-the-retraction-watch-hijacked-journal-checker/" class="more-link">Continue reading <span class="screen-reader-text">Want to know whether that journal is scamming you?

<h4>Mirror, mirror</h4>



<p><em>Clay models of dull and shiny beetles showed that Christmas beetles’ mirrorlike exterior may not serve as a form of camouflage against predators, <strong>Susan Milius</strong> reported in “<a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/mirror-beetle-shiny-camouflage-ecology">Scientists scuff a theory about shiny disguises</a>” (</em>SN: 4/9/22, p. 4<em>).</em></p>



<p>Perhaps the clay models were simply not able to reproduce all the potential ways that the beetles’ glittery bodies affect light and protect the insect, reader <strong>Ron Kern </strong>suggested.</p>



<p>It’s true that the clay models didn’t mimic all possible light effects generated by Christmas beetles, <strong>Milius </strong>says. But that wasn’t the aim of the experiment. Think of the study as a sort of dissection, examining just one possible light trick at a time, she says. The results suggest that shine by itself isn’t a deterrent against predators. Further testing could investigate whether other aspects of the beetle’s mirror surface might offer benefits to these showy insects, <strong>Milius</strong> says.</p>





<h4>Crater shapes</h4>



<p><em>The impact that forged Hiawatha crater in Greenland happened about 58 million years ago, <strong>Carolyn Gramling </strong>reported in “<a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/hiawatha-crater-greenland-age-younger-dryas">Greenland impact crater is surprisingly old</a>” (</em>SN: 4/9/22, p. 5<em>).</em></p>



<p>Reader <strong>Barry Maletzky </strong>asked why most impact craters are circular given that space rocks can strike at different angles.</p>



<p>Most craters are circular because of an impactor’s explosive punch, says associate news editor <strong>Christopher Crockett</strong>. When space rocks crash into rocky planets and moons at high velocity, a tremendous amount of energy is transferred within a short period of time. At most angles of impact, such a process produces the typically round craters we see, scientists reported in 2013 in the <em>Journal of Geophysical Research: Planets</em>. “The effect is similar to planting explosives at the site and letting them blow,” <strong>Crockett</strong> says.</p>



<p>Although they’re rare, elliptical craters do occur in the solar system, and impact angle plays a role. The angle at which a crater becomes more likely to be elliptical than round depends on space rock size, impact velocity and type of material at the impact site, the study showed.</p>



<h4>Resurrection roadblock</h4>



<p><em>Scientists re-created the genome of the extinct Christmas Island rat by comparing it against the genome of a living relative. But some key DNA remains a mystery, <strong>Anna Gibbs</strong> reported in “<a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/crispr-de-extinct-christmas-rat-species-gene-editing">Rat reveals limits of de-extinction</a>” (</em>SN: 4/9/22, p. 12<em>).</em></p>



<p>Reader <strong>Tim Cliffe</strong> wondered if a complete genome could be reconstructed given enough DNA samples from different specimens of the extinct species.</p>



<p>The issue isn’t that DNA is missing, but that scientists can’t make sense of all the genetic sequences they have, says <strong>Tom Gilbert</strong>, an evolutionary biologist at the University of Copenhagen. Some genes in the Christmas Island rat’s genome have diverged so much that they aren’t remotely similar to the reference genome. If we can’t identify the gene, we are unable to re-create it in a reference genome for the purpose of de-extinction, <strong>Gilbert</strong> says.</p>



<h4>Deciphering brain waves</h4>



<p><em>Researchers are studying the emotions of horses, octopuses and other creatures to understand how animals experience the world, <strong>Alla Katsnelson</strong> reported in “<a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/animal-emotion-behavior-welfare-feelings">What do animals feel?</a>” (</em>SN: 4/9/22, p. 16<em>).</em></p>



<p>In one study, horses that spent more time alone had more gamma brain wave a­ctivity than horses that grazed freely with a herd, <strong>Katsnelson</strong> reported. In people, high levels of such brain wave activity have been linked to anxiety and stress. Reader <strong>Barbara Allan </strong>thought that it was the opposite: Low levels of gamma brain wave activity are linked to stress and anxiety in humans.</p>



<p>Scientists are still working out how brain waves in people relate to various mental states, <strong>Katsnelson</strong> says. Studying brain waves and interpreting those studies is complicated, and the findings in this field vary. In their report, the researchers who studied horses point to evidence linking anxiety and stress to more gamma waves in people, she says. But other groups have found conflicting results, complicating the picture.</p>

<p>Learning amazing new things about science is a delight — and sharing those amazing things with others is even better. That’s a big reason why we’ve been publishing <em>Science News</em> for more than 100 years. And that’s why we’ve launched a new print magazine for young people called <em>Science News Explores</em>.</p>



<p>Maya Ajmera, our publisher, president and CEO, is a parent herself. She envisions the magazine as a way for kids to connect with science that doesn’t feel like homework, and that doesn’t involve staring at a screen. “<em>Science News Explores</em> is written in a way that middle school children can fully understand,” she says, “while still being a great read for adults.”</p>





<p>We know a thing or two about kids and science, having reported for young people since 2003 with our award-winning <a href="https://www.sciencenewsforstudents.org/"><em>Science News for Students</em></a> website. “They ask really great questions,” says Sarah Zielinski, editor of <em>Science News Explores</em> and managing editor of <em>Science News for Students</em>. “I want to feed that curiosity and help them hold onto it as they grow into adults.”</p>



<p>And you’ll find reporting by your favorite <em>Science News</em> journalists in <em>Science News Explores</em> too. Our writers and editors are masters at making complex science accessible to younger readers, while not dumbing it down. It may surprise you to learn that the articles, many of which are adapted from <em>Science News</em> articles, are often longer, because technical terms need to be replaced by explanation. It’s a reminder of how often fields of science, or any field of expertise, develop shorthand terminology that makes communication within the field easier, but can make it harder for others to understand.</p>



<p>The inaugural issue includes an introduction to what may be <a href="https://www.sciencenewsforstudents.org/article/new-tiny-chameleon-species-world-smallest-reptile">the world’s tiniest reptile</a>; a <a href="https://www.sciencenewsforstudents.org/article/spacecraft-engineer-overcame-self-doubt">conversation with Tiera Fletcher</a>, who designs spacecraft that may fly people to Mars; and a voyage to the ocean depths. By steering a remote-controlled camera along the seafloor, scientists have learned how <a href="https://www.sciencenewsforstudents.org/article/whales-get-a-second-life-as-deep-sea-buffets">a whale’s carcass helps feed more than 100 species</a>, including “snotflowers.” Readers can also use a map of Mount Everest to learn how <a href="https://www.sciencenewsforstudents.org/article/analyze-this-microplastics-mount-everests-snow">tiny bits of plastic have made it to the world’s highest peak</a>. And you’ll find out whether seeing a movie about Spider-Man <a href="https://www.sciencenewsforstudents.org/article/fighting-spider-fear-with-spider-man">may help tame fear of arachnids</a> in real life. We hope you’ll share the joy of science with a young person in your life by <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/explores">giving them a subscription</a> to <em>Science News Explores</em>. I hope you’ll enjoy the magazine as much as we’ve enjoyed creating it for the next generation of science fans.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://gcamp6f.com/2022/05/28/simple-geometrical-optics-to-understand-and-design-point-scanning-microscopes/">Simple geometrical optics to understand and design point-scanning microscopes</a></h4>

              
                <p>Custom-built microscopes have become more and more sophisticated over the last years to provide a larger FOV, better resolution through some flavor of adaptive optics or simply more neurons simultaneously. Professional optical engineers are hired to design the ideal lens combination or the objectives with <a href="https://www.zemax.com/pages/opticstudio">Zemax</a>, a software that can simulate the propagation of light through lenses systems based on wave optics.</p>



<p>Unfortunately, these complex design optimizations might discourage users from trying to understand their microscopes themselves. In this blog post, I will give a few examples how optical paths of microscopes can be understood and, to some extent, also designed using simple geometrical optics. Geometrical optics, or ray optics, are accessible to anybody who is willing to understand a small equation or two.</p>



<p>Three examples: <strong>(1)</strong> How to compute the beam size at the back focal plane of the objective. <strong>(2)</strong> How to compute the field of view size of a point scanning microscope. <strong>(3)</strong> How to compute the axial focus shift using a remotely positioned tunable lens.</p>



<p>All examples are based on a typical point scanning microscope as used for two-photon microscopy.</p>



<p></p>



<p><strong>(1) How to compute the beam size at the back focal plane of the objective</strong></p>



<p>The beam size at the back focal plane is the limiting factor for the resolution. The resolution is determined by the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Numerical_aperture">numerical aperture</a> (NA) focusing onto the sample, and a smaller beam diameter at the &#8220;back side&#8221; of the objective can result in an effectively lower NA compared to what is possible with the same objective and larger beam diameter.</p>



<p>In general, it is therefore the goal to overfill the back focal aperture with the beam (check out this <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nmeth818">review</a> if you want to know more). However, especially for video-rate two-photon microscopy, one of the scan mirrors is a resonant scanner, which usually comes with a usable aperture of ca. 5 mm. Often, there are only two lenses between scan mirror and objective, scan lens and tube lens. The two black lines illustrate the &#8220;boundaries&#8221; of the beam:</p>

<p>If the beam diameter at the scan mirror is 5 mm, the beam diameter d<sub>BFA</sub> at the objective&#8217;s back aperture will be, using simple trigonometry:</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center"><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=d_%7BBFA%7D+%3D+f_t%2Ff_s+%5Ccdot&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" srcset="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=d_%7BBFA%7D+%3D+f_t%2Ff_s+%5Ccdot&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002 1x, https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=d_%7BBFA%7D+%3D+f_t%2Ff_s+%5Ccdot&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002&#038;zoom=4.5 4x" alt="d_{BFA} = f_t/f_s &#92;cdot" class="latex" /> 5 mm</p>



<p>Therefore, for a typical ratio f<sub>t</sub>:f<sub>s</sub> of 4:1 or 3:1, you will get a beam size at the objective&#8217;s back aperture of 20 mm or 15 mm. This is enough to overfill a typical 40x objective (objective back aperture <a href="https://www.thorlabs.com/newgrouppage9.cfm?objectgroup_id=5824">8-12 mm</a>, depending on the objective&#8217;s NA), but barely enough for a 16x objective or even lower magnification with reasonably high NA (e.g., for NA=0.8, the back aperture is around 20 mm or higher).</p>



<p>Therefore, when you design a beam path or buy a microscope, it is important to plan ahead which objectives you are going to use with it. And this simple equation tells you how large the beam will be at the objective&#8217;s back aperture&#8217;s location.</p>

<p><strong>(2) How to compute the field of view size of a point scanning microscope</strong></p>



<p>Another very simple calculation to do is to compute the expected size of the field of view (FOV) of your microscope design. This calculation is based on the very same lenses as above, plus the objective. In this case, different rays (colored) illustrate different deflections through the mirror, not the boundaries of the beam as above:</p>

<p>The deflection angle range of the beam, α, is de-magnified by the scan lens/tube lens system to the smaller angle β and then propagates to the objective. The top-bottom spread of the scanned beams on the left indicates the size of the FOV. Using simple trigonometry based on the angle and the distances of lenses to their focal point, one can state (but see also Fabian&#8217;s comment below the blog post):</p>

<p>From which one can derive the expected size of the FOV:</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center"><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=s_%7BFOV%7D+%3D+tan%28%5Cbeta%29+%5Ccdot+f_o+%3D+tan%28%5Calpha%29+%5Ccdot+f_o+%5Ccdot+f_s%2Ff_t&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" srcset="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=s_%7BFOV%7D+%3D+tan%28%5Cbeta%29+%5Ccdot+f_o+%3D+tan%28%5Calpha%29+%5Ccdot+f_o+%5Ccdot+f_s%2Ff_t&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002 1x, https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=s_%7BFOV%7D+%3D+tan%28%5Cbeta%29+%5Ccdot+f_o+%3D+tan%28%5Calpha%29+%5Ccdot+f_o+%5Ccdot+f_s%2Ff_t&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002&#038;zoom=4.5 4x" alt="s_{FOV} = tan(&#92;beta) &#92;cdot f_o = tan(&#92;alpha) &#92;cdot f_o &#92;cdot f_s/f_t" class="latex" /></p>



<p>Interestingly, the FOV size depends linearly on the ratio f<sub>s</sub>/f<sub>t</sub>. As we have seen above, the beam diameter at the back aperture of the objective depends linearly on f<sub>t</sub>/f<sub>s</sub>, the inverse. This results in a trade-off, such that, when you try overfill the back aperture by increasing f<sub>t</sub>/f<sub>s</sub>, you will automatically decrease the maximal FOV size. It is therefore important to know beforehand what is more important, high NA (and therefore resolution) or a large FOV size. This is not only but to some extent already determined by the choice of scan lens and tube lens.</p>



<p>To give some real numbers, the deflection angle of a typical resonant scanner is 26°. Let&#8217;s say we have f<sub>t</sub>/f<sub>s</sub>=4. The &#8220;effective focal length&#8221; of the objective is often not obvious nor indicated. As a rule of thumb, the magnification (e.g., <a href="https://www.thorlabs.com/newgrouppage9.cfm?objectgroup_id=5824">16x from Nikon</a>) together with the appropriate tube lens (e.g., 200 mm) can be used to compute the focal length as 200 mm/16 = 12.5 mm. &#8211; Where does the 200 mm come from? This is a value that is company-specific. Most companies use 200 mm as this standard tube lens focal length, while for example Olympus uses 180 mm as default. (As a side-effect, a 20x objective from Olympus has a shorter focal length than a 20x objective from Nikon.)</p>



<p>Together, we have f<sub>o</sub>=12.5 mm, α=26°, f<sub>t</sub>/f<sub>s</sub>=4, arriving at s<sub>FOV</sub>=1.5 mm as an estimate for the maximally achievable FOV using these components.</p>



<p>As another side note, when you look up the maximal scan angles of a scanner, there is often confusion between &#8220;mechanical&#8221; and &#8220;optical&#8221; scan angle. When a scanner moves <em>mechanically</em> over 10°, the beam will be <em>optically</em> deflected by twice the amount, 20°. For FOV calculations, the optical scan angle should be used, of course.</p>

<p><strong>(3) How to compute the axial focus shift using a remotely positioned tunable lens</strong></p>



<p>The final third example for gemetrical optics is a bit more involved, but it might be interesting also for less ambitious microscope tinkerers to get the gist of it.</p>



<p>I few weeks ago, together with PhD student Gwen Schoenfeld in the lab of Fritjof Helmchen, I wanted to re-design a two-photon microscope in order to enable remote focusing using an electro-tunable lens. Here&#8217;s the basic microscope &#8220;design&#8221; that I started with:</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img data-attachment-id="7124" data-permalink="https://gcamp6f.com/2022/05/28/simple-geometrical-optics-to-understand-and-design-point-scanning-microscopes/remote_full-1/" data-orig-file="https://ptrrupprecht.files.wordpress.com/2022/05/remote_full-1.png" data-orig-size="2195,538" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="remote_full-1" data-image-description="" data-image-caption="" data-medium-file="https://ptrrupprecht.files.wordpress.com/2022/05/remote_full-1.png?w=300" data-large-file="https://ptrrupprecht.files.wordpress.com/2022/05/remote_full-1.png?w=640" src="https://ptrrupprecht.files.wordpress.com/2022/05/remote_full-1.png?w=1024" alt="" class="wp-image-7124" srcset="https://ptrrupprecht.files.wordpress.com/2022/05/remote_full-1.png?w=1024 1024w, https://ptrrupprecht.files.wordpress.com/2022/05/remote_full-1.png?w=2048 2048w, https://ptrrupprecht.files.wordpress.com/2022/05/remote_full-1.png?w=150 150w, https://ptrrupprecht.files.wordpress.com/2022/05/remote_full-1.png?w=300 300w, https://ptrrupprecht.files.wordpress.com/2022/05/remote_full-1.png?w=768 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>As you can see, the objective, scan lens and tube lens are as simple as in the previous examples. Behind the scan lens (f<sub>s</sub>), there is only a slow galvo scanner (for the y-axis), while the fast resonant scanner (for the x-axis) is behind a 1.5:1 relay. There are two ideas behind this &#8220;relay&#8221; configuration. First, a relay between the two scan mirrors makes it possible to position them more precisely at the focus of the scan lenses (there exist also some more advanced relay systems, but this is a science by itself). Second, the relay system here is magnifying and enlarges the beam size from 5 mm (at the resonant scanner) to 7.5 mm (at the slow galvo scanner). In the end, this results in a smaller FOV size for the x-axis but in a larger beam size at the back of the objective and therefore better resolution.</p>



<p>To insert a remote tunable lens into this system, we had to do this in an optically conjugate plane of the back focal plane. This required the addition of yet another relay. This time, we chose a de-magnifying relay system. The tunable lens had a larger free aperture than the resonant scanner, so it made sense to use the full aperture. Also, as you will see below, this de-magnifying relay system considerably increases the resulting z-scanning range using the tunable lens. For the tunable lens itself, we chose a tunable lens together with a negative offset lens, resulting in a default behavior of the lens as if it did not exist (at least to a first approximation).</p>



<p>Now, before choosing the parts, I wanted to know which z-scanning range would be expected for a given combination of parts. My idea, although there might be simpler ways to get the answer, was to compute the complex <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_beam_parameter">beam parameter</a> of the laser beam after passing through the entire lens system. The beam waist and therefore the focus can then be computed as the point where the real part of the beam parameter is zero (check out <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_beam_parameter">the Wikipedia article</a> for more details).</p>



<p>To calculate the complex beam diameter after passing through the system, I used geometrical optics. More precisely, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ray_transfer_matrix_analysis">ABCD optics</a>. ABCD optics is a formalism to use geometrical optics using 2&#215;2 matrices. A lens or a certain amount of free propagation space are represented as simple matrices, and the beam propagation (distance from center line and angle) is then computed by multiplying all the matrices. For the system above, this means the multiplication of 16 matrices, which is not difficult but takes very long. The perfect tool for that is <a href="https://www.wolfram.com/mathematica/">Wolfram&#8217;s Mathematica</a>, which is not free but can be tested as a free trial for 30 days per e-mail address. All the details of this calculation are in a <a href="https://github.com/PTRRupprecht/Calculate-z-range-with-remote-ETL">Mathematica Notebook</a> uploaded to Github.</p>



<p>Briefly, the result of this rather lengthy mathematical calculation is a simple result, with the main actors being the axial z-shift in the sample (z) and the effective focal length of the tunable lens (f<sub>ETL</sub>): </p>



<p class="has-text-align-center"><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=z+%3D+-%5Cfrac%7Bf_o%5E2+%5Ccdot+f_s%5E2+%5Ccdot+f_%7Br1%7D%5E2+%5Ccdot+f_%7Br3%7D%5E2%7D%7Bf_%7BETL%7D+%5Ccdot+f_t%5E2+%5Ccdot+f_%7Br2%7D%5E2+%5Ccdot+f_%7Br4%7D%5E2%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002" srcset="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=z+%3D+-%5Cfrac%7Bf_o%5E2+%5Ccdot+f_s%5E2+%5Ccdot+f_%7Br1%7D%5E2+%5Ccdot+f_%7Br3%7D%5E2%7D%7Bf_%7BETL%7D+%5Ccdot+f_t%5E2+%5Ccdot+f_%7Br2%7D%5E2+%5Ccdot+f_%7Br4%7D%5E2%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002 1x, https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=z+%3D+-%5Cfrac%7Bf_o%5E2+%5Ccdot+f_s%5E2+%5Ccdot+f_%7Br1%7D%5E2+%5Ccdot+f_%7Br3%7D%5E2%7D%7Bf_%7BETL%7D+%5Ccdot+f_t%5E2+%5Ccdot+f_%7Br2%7D%5E2+%5Ccdot+f_%7Br4%7D%5E2%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=333333&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002&#038;zoom=4.5 4x" alt="z = -&#92;frac{f_o^2 &#92;cdot f_s^2 &#92;cdot f_{r1}^2 &#92;cdot f_{r3}^2}{f_{ETL} &#92;cdot f_t^2 &#92;cdot f_{r2}^2 &#92;cdot f_{r4}^2}" class="latex" /></p>



<p>Using this formula and a set of candidate lenses, it is then possible to compute the z-scanning range:</p>

<p>Here, the blue trace is using the formula above. For the red trace, I displaced the ETL slightly from the conjugate position, making the transfer function more linear but the z-range also smaller, and showing the power and flexibility of the ABCD approach using Mathematica.</p>



<p>Of course, this calculation does not give the resolution for any of these configurations. To compute actual resolution of an optical system, you will have to work with real (not perfect) lenses, using ZEMAX or a similar software that can import and simulate lens data from e.g. Thorlabs. But it is a nice playground to develop an intuition. For example, from the equation it is clear that the z-range depends on the magnification of the relay lenses quadratically, not linearly. Also, the objective focal length enters this equation with the power of the square. Therefore, if you have such a remote scanning system where a 16x objective results in 200 μm of z-range, switching to a 40x objective will reduce the z-range to only 32 μm!</p>



<p>This third example for the use of geometrical optics goes a bit deeper, and the complex beam parameter is, to be honest, not really geometrical optics but rather Gaussian optics (which can however use the power of geometrical ABCD optics, for complicated reasons).</p>



<p>In 2016, I used these mathematical methods to do some calculations for <a href="https://opg.optica.org/boe/fulltext.cfm?uri=boe-7-5-1656&amp;id=338741">our 2016 paper</a> on remote z-scanning with a voice coil motor, and it helped me a lot to perform some clean analyses without resorting to ZEMAX. </p>



<p>Apart from that, the calculation of beam size and FOV size are very simple even for beginners and a nice starting point for a better understanding of one&#8217;s point scanning microscope.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/mobius-strip-carbon-atoms-chemistry">Scientists made a Möbius strip out of a tiny carbon nanobelt</a></h4>

              
                <p>From cylindrical nanotubes to the hollow spheres known as buckyballs, carbon is famous for forming tiny, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/chemists-have-created-and-imaged-new-form-carbon">complex nanostructures</a> (<em>SN: 8/15/19</em>). Now, scientists have added a new geometry to the list: a twisted strip called a Möbius carbon nanobelt.</p>



<p>Möbius strips are twisted bands that are famous in mathematics for their weird properties. A rubber band, for example, has an inside and an outside. But if you cut the rubber band crosswise, twist one end and glue it back together, you get a <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/twist-möbius-band">Möbius strip</a>, which has only one face (<em>SN: 7/24/07</em>).</p>





<p>In 2017, researchers created <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.aam8158">carbon nanobelts</a>, thin loops of carbon that are like tiny slices of a carbon nanotube. That feat suggested it might be possible to create a nanobelt with a twist, a Möbius carbon nanobelt. To make the itsy-bitsy twisty carbon, some of the same researchers stitched together individual smaller molecules using a <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s44160-022-00075-8">series of 14 chemical reactions</a>, chemist Yasutomo Segawa of the Institute for Molecular Science in Okazaki, Japan, and colleagues report May 19 in <em>Nature Synthesis</em>.</p>



<p>While carbon nanotubes can be used to make <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/chip-carbon-nanotubes-not-silicon-marks-computing-milestone">new types of computer chips</a> and added to <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/new-fabric-becomes-more-breathable-you-work-sweat">textiles</a> to create fabric with unusual properties, scientists don’t yet know of any practical applications for the twisty nanobelts (<em>SN: 8/28/19</em>;<em> SN: 2/8/19</em>). But, Segawa says, the work improves scientists’ ability to make tiny carbon structures, especially complicated ones.</p>

                <p>As science journalists, we’re accustomed to data. We sift through it and talk it over with experts. We pay close attention to the stories that numbers can tell. But at this point in the pandemic, many of us are having a hard time finding the story. That’s because the numbers aren’t there.</p>



<p>Data on coronavirus infections in the United States have become less reliable, many experts say. Fewer people are getting tested, local governments have stopped reporting results, and home test results <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/covid-coronavirus-rapid-test-at-home-positive-cases">rarely make it into official counts</a> (<em>SN: 4/22/22</em>).</p>





<aside class="wp-block-sciencenews-inline-related-post alignleft"><h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/sign-up-for-e-mail-updates-on-the-coronavirus-outbreak">Sign up for e-mail updates on the latest coronavirus news and research</a></h4></aside>



<p>To be sure, there are still <a href="https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#datatracker-home">official numbers to be found</a>. They don’t look great. Hospitalizations are low compared with earlier in the pandemic, but they’re rising again, and the case counts that do exist are ticking up, too. After dipping in March, the tally in the United States is back up to more than 100,000 known cases a day. A third of Americans now live in places with “medium to high” levels of virus spread.</p>



<p>With these not-so-great numbers in mind, it’s not a stretch to assume that the missing data probably wouldn’t tell us a cheery story either. We are almost certainly undercounting cases in the United States. And we’re not alone. Amid worldwide declines in testing and sequencing to see where coronavirus is spreading and how it’s changing, “we are blinding ourselves to the evolution of the virus,” Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, the head of the World Health Organization, said May 22.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We’ve never had a perfect count of COVID-19 cases, of course. Early on in the pandemic, before testing ramped up in some places, scientists found clues about COVID-19’s transmission in odd places. Wastewater testing, for instance, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coronavirus-covid-19-wastewater-sewage-warning-monitoring">spotted signs of the virus getting flushed down the toilet</a> (<em>SN: 5/28/20</em>). That dirty water continues to be an indirect, but helpful, measure of viral loads in a community. Here in Oregon, where I live, some wastewater spots again show increases in coronavirus, suggesting a surge.</p>



<p>Even more indirect measurements can give us additional hints. Early on in the pandemic, “smart” thermometers connected to the internet generated fever data used to <a href="https://healthweather.us/map?mode=covid_risk&amp;resolution=state">map risk of getting sick by region</a>. Internet searches for words and phrases, such as “chills,” “fever” and “I can’t smell,” also <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/05/opinion/coronavirus-google-searches.html">pointed to virus hot spots</a>.</p>



<p>My favorite digital sign of illness comes from online reviews of Yankee Candles. One-star reviews (“No scent.” “Embarrassed as this was a gift.”) <a href="https://twitter.com/kate_ptrv/status/1332398737604431874?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1332398737604431874%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Ftwitter.com%2F">tracked neatly</a> with a rise in COVID-19 cases in 2020 and the subsequent loss of smell. Just last week, <a href="https://twitter.com/drewtoothpaste/status/1527094311988482053">more one-star reviews</a> showed up, notes Twitter user @drewtoothpaste, who compiled the latest complaints.&nbsp; “No smell.” “Absolutely no scent.” “Very disappointing!!!”</p>

<p>These one-star reviews are not airtight evidence of COVID-19 rates — not by any stretch. But they add to the broader picture that we are not yet done with this pandemic, as much as we would all love to be. We are still experiencing disruptions to our lives, illness, suffering and sadness. Very disappointing indeed.</p>



<p>To better understand this particular moment in the pandemic, I talked with data expert Beth Blauer of Johns Hopkins University. She’s been tracking metrics of the pandemic since it started. In the earliest days, she helped build databases, including a widely used COVID-19 tracker, that ultimately became the<a href="https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/"> Coronavirus Resource Center</a> at Hopkins. Those tools get data out to other scientists, health experts, government leaders, journalists and people who want to keep up with the latest numbers. The interview has been edited for length and clarity.</p>



<p><strong><em>SN</em>: How solid is the testing data right now in the United States?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Blauer:</strong> The testing data in this country is crumbling…. We’re barely getting data out of the application-based resources that come with home tests. And the home tests are running 10 bucks apiece. That’s cost prohibitive for people who live below the poverty line. Even middle-income people are not spending $20 for a pack of two. [<a href="https://www.covid.gov/tests">Free tests are available in the United States</a>, but it’s not known how many of those tests are reaching people who need them.]</p>



<p>We are flying blind. Completely. We are in a surge right now, but we don’t even appreciate fully how big of a surge this is.</p>



<p><strong><em>SN</em>: Any guesses?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Blauer:</strong> I have no idea. Anecdotally, I’m sure you and I both know a ton of people who have COVID-19 or who just got over it. All the mitigation strategies are not being spun up to meet the rising demand that a surge, like we’re in right now, calls for, which means we’re just going to be getting a lot more COVID-19. People are going on vacations, they’re traveling, graduations, all of these things are just going forward. So yes, we’re seeing some increase in hospitalization, but I don’t think we have any idea how much disease there is in the community.</p>





<p><strong><em>SN</em>: I’ve had trouble gauging my risk from COVID-19 in everyday life. Is that typical?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Blauer: </strong>It’s a mess. I think a lot of people are sensing that. And it dilutes our capacity to have faith in science and in all the things that have happened over time. It is confusing. It’s like, “Oh, we have just as much COVID, but we can go to parties? And school is in?” Everything all of a sudden gets called into question.</p>



<p>[That uncertainty highlights a] need to really think critically about our public health infrastructure in this country.</p>



<p><strong><em>SN</em>: How should we be living with this virus right now?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Blauer: </strong>We all acknowledge that we need social anchoring in our communities. We need to see people. We can’t hide away in our houses forever. But that means we have to think about what it means to live with a pathogen like COVID-19 out there. And we’re not giving ourselves all the best tools to be able to do that.</p>



<p>I work in a building where right down the hall, people are getting chemotherapy. I feel a responsibility to the community that I’m not giving them a disease that could potentially kill them. That’s not happening in a lot of places. For me, it’s sad. It’s like a loss of collective empathy, and I don’t think we should not talk about that.</p>



<p>I think I would feel the very same way even if I wasn’t leading this effort here at Hopkins.&nbsp; But I don’t know. Maybe it’s because I <em>feel</em> the toll of a million Americans who have died. I’ve experienced loss in my life. I do have a lot of empathy. But I don’t think I’m overdoing it.</p>



<p><strong><em>SN</em>: But you’re not saying we should all hunker down and stay away from people.</strong></p>



<p><strong>Blauer: </strong>No. We’re done with that. But we have to start integrating and really putting into place these habits [masking, testing and adjusting behavior when needed]. Because I think it’s the only way we get out of this.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/gun-violence-mass-shootings-increase-united-states-data-uvalde-buffalo">Mass shootings and gun violence in the United States are increasing</a></h4>

              
                <p>On May 24, at an elementary school in Uvalde, Texas, 19 children and two teachers were killed by a shooter. Just 10 days earlier, a white gunman was accused of a racially motivated shooting in a grocery store in Buffalo, N.Y., that left 10 Black people dead. These tragic incidents are among the latest mass shootings to rattle the United States, the only country with<a href="https://www.atf.gov/firearms/docs/report/2021-firearms-commerce-report/download"> more civilian-owned firearms than citizens</a>.</p>



<p>Sadly, mass shootings — the definitions of which vary — are just a fraction of the story. In the United States, gun violence incidents are on the rise. In 2021, nearly 21,000 people were killed by firearms (not including suicides), according to the <a href="https://www.gunviolencearchive.org/">Gun Violence Archive</a>, an online database of U.S. gun violence incidents. That’s a 33 percent increase from 2017, the year that <a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMp2200169?query=TOC">firearm-related injuries usurped motor vehicle crashes</a> as the most common cause of death among children and adolescents.&nbsp;</p>





<p>In that same time frame, active shooter incidents nearly doubled. The FBI designates an active shooter as “one or more individuals who are engaged in killing or attempting to kill in a populated area.” In 2021, <a href="https://www.fbi.gov/news/press-releases/press-releases/fbi-designates-61-active-shooter-incidents-in-2021">61 such incidents</a> in the United States killed 103 people. In 2017, the number of incidents was 31, though deaths totaled 143.</p>



<p>“I can&#8217;t think of an issue that requires more urgency and attention,” says Sonali Rajan, a school violence prevention researcher from Columbia University. “Gun violence is a solvable problem.”</p>



<div class="wp-block-sciencenews-content-sidebar">
<h3>Active shooters</h3>



<p>Data collected by the FBI reveal a steady increase over the past 20 years in active shooter incidents, which the Bureau defines as “one or more individuals who are engaged in killing or attempting to kill in a populated area.”</p>

<p>In 2020, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the National Institutes of Health awarded a combined $25 million in grants for research on gun violence prevention, ending a <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/gun-research-faces-roadblocks-and-dearth-data">25-year paucity of federal funding</a> in the field (<em>SN: 5/3/16</em>). During that decades-long financial drought, research on gun violence prevention relied on funds from private foundations and state grants.&nbsp;</p>



<p>One of the few state-funded institutions in the country is the New Jersey Gun Violence Research Center at Rutgers University in Piscataway. The center conducts interdisciplinary research on the causes and prevention of gun violence, including homicides and suicides. Richard Barnes, the center’s assistant director, manages research projects that focus on suicide prevention and how social disparities relate to violence in Black and brown communities</p>



<p><em>Science News </em>spoke with Barnes and Rajan about U.S. gun violence, ways to help reduce it and what research is needed. The following conversations have been edited for length and clarity.</p>



<p><strong><em>SN</em></strong><strong>: What recent trends in gun violence in the United States stand out to you?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Rajan:</strong> Gun violence as a problem has only gotten worse over the past several years. There are on average about 100,000 Americans who are shot with a firearm every single year and an estimated 40,000 of those individuals die from their firearm-related injuries. [These numbers include suicides.] In the last couple of years, that number has gone up.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Barnes:</strong> In the last two years, during the pandemic, there was a significant surge in gun purchasing. And we&#8217;ve seen increasing rates of homicides and interpersonal violence in our cities across the country. 2021 was a record-breaking year, with the most gun deaths period, including suicide. It was also record-breaking in the sense that a lot of Black and brown communities throughout the country experienced a significant increase in gun violence. [According to the CDC, the nearly 35 percent increase in overall firearm homicides from 2019 to 2020 – <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/71/wr/mm7119e1.htm?s_cid=mm7119e1_w">rising from 4.6 to 6.1 deaths per 100,000 people</a> – hit Black communities particularly hard.]&nbsp;</p>



<p>This American problem of gun violence is significant, and I&#8217;m hoping soon that we are able to distance ourselves from this trend of increased gun violence, which is so devastating.</p>



<p><strong><em>SN</em></strong><strong>: Why is gun violence so much worse in the United States than in so many other countries?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Barnes:</strong> We have to consider our unique difference in terms of gun ownership. We have way more guns than a lot of other countries. And where you have a lot of firearms, you are going to have more gun violence.&nbsp;</p>



<div class="wp-block-sciencenews-content-sidebar">
<h3>Gun ownership</h3>



<p>The United States has more than twice the number of guns per 100 people than any other country, data from the Small Arms Survey show. With 120.5 firearms per 100 residents, that means there are more guns in the United States than people.&nbsp;</p>

	>
	</iframe></div>



<p><strong><em>SN</em></strong><strong>: What does research suggest can help reduce gun violence?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Barnes:</strong> Again, where there are more firearms, there is more gun violence. So the first thing to consider is access to firearms. I&#8217;m not advocating that we shouldn&#8217;t have firearms, but that&#8217;s one way.</p>



<p>We also have<a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/neighborhood-outreach-can-reduce-inner-city-gun-violence"> violence interruption organizations</a> (<em>SN: 11/4/19</em>). Their role is to work locally with other organizations — a lot of times they work with law enforcement — to gather information about the effectiveness of outreach programs and do their best to prevent and intervene in those skirmishes that might lead to gun violence. We know that when those organizations run right, they can have an impact on reducing gun violence. It really focuses on and encourages investment in public safety within those communities. That&#8217;s not a cheap course of action, it takes resources. And it&#8217;s been really difficult to get those needed resources for folks in the community, and also the research.</p>



<p><strong><em>SN</em></strong><strong>: Does increasing police presence help quell gun violence?&nbsp;</strong></p>



<p><strong>Rajan</strong>: Increasing police is not a solution to gun violence. There is no evidence that that works. In fact, I think it&#8217;s important to underscore that police violence is a form of gun violence. Rather than increasing funding to the police, there are a number of things that we could do, such as investing in communities and in schools in ways that are far more effective at deterring gun violence.</p>



<p><strong><em>SN:</em></strong><strong> In the wake of the Texas school shooting, there’s been</strong><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/education/2022/05/25/harden-schools-arm-teachers-uvalde/"><strong> talk about increasing campus security and arming teachers</strong></a><strong>. Is that effective?&nbsp;</strong></p>



<p><strong>Rajan:</strong> There&#8217;s actually evidence that shows that criminalizing a school space [by increasing police presence] is hugely detrimental both for children and their learning outcomes, and it also disproportionately impacts children of color in very negative ways. That to me is a really good example of our school districts investing lots of money into practices that are not doing anything productive, and may in fact be having unintended negative consequences.</p>



<p>In the context of schools, there are a lot of things that actually have no evidence to support their effectiveness: metal detectors, zero tolerance policies, anonymous threat reporting systems and arming teachers with firearms. There is absolutely no scientific evidence that any of these kinds of safety strategies are actually effective at deterring gun violence in a school.</p>

<h3>Rising gun violence</h3>



<p>In 2021, there were nearly 21,000 gun-related deaths in the United States, not counting suicides. That’s a 35 percent increase from just two years earlier, and part of an ongoing rise in U.S. firearm deaths, data from the Gun Violence Archive show.</p>

<p><strong><em>SN</em></strong><strong>: What kind of research is needed to reduce gun violence?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Barnes:</strong> [At the New Jersey Gun Violence Research Center], we&#8217;re speaking to people who have owned a firearm illicitly within the last five years. Our question is very different from the criminal question, which is where you get your firearms from. That question is fine, but we&#8217;re aiming to better understand the lived experience of illicit firearm owners, to better understand why they own guns. What is it about where they live, how they live and why they think they need a firearm?</p>



<p>I think a lot of times, people discount the lived experience, because they start and end with the question over whether it’s legal to own guns. They don’t ask the question of whether you should own a firearm. But if you&#8217;re living in an area that&#8217;s dangerous, where people get shot, how are you going to protect yourself, your family, your loved ones? So, we&#8217;re trying to answer that question, in hopes of being able to suggest: Here&#8217;s some meaningful things that can be done.</p>



<p><strong><em>SN</em></strong><strong>: What other kinds of information can help prevent gun violence?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Barnes:</strong> <a href="https://health.gov/healthypeople/priority-areas/social-determinants-health">Social determinants</a> of health are the factors that either contribute or hinder communities from thriving [such as economic stability, social support, education and health care access]. There are so many similarities among communities that are struggling the most from gun violence. I think the conversation around gun violence has to include questions around how much [these social determinants] contribute to or impact what we understand about gun violence. And in particular, the increase or uptick in gun violence.</p>



<p><strong><em>SN: </em></strong><strong>What is a major misconception in gun violence prevention?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Rajan: </strong>That the solution to gun violence is entirely based on gun laws. The gun laws are an extremely important part of the gun violence prevention puzzle. But it is not the only part. We need to think about all of the ways in which we are attending to the health and well-being of children and adults. Like, why would a 14-year-old choose to carry a firearm to begin with? They fundamentally don&#8217;t feel safe and we as a society are failing our children. What are the big systemic factors that are driving this level of violence? We need to reimagine what gun violence prevention looks like.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong><em>SN</em></strong><strong>: What challenges do gun violence prevention researchers face?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Barnes:</strong> Funding is the biggest one, but also having partners on the ground is important.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We&#8217;re a research institution, so there&#8217;s a lot of distrust that needs to be overcome when we enter a community. A lot of Black and brown communities feel like they&#8217;ve been poked and prodded, they’ve seen this before. We need to have relationships on the ground that start with trust, to figure out how we can get at some of the questions that may lead to recommendations and prevention methods that work.&nbsp;</p>



<p>To do that, organizations on the ground need to be funded as well. Because if they go away, it makes it nearly impossible for us to penetrate those communities that have a well-reasoned fear of outsiders, in particular researchers. That&#8217;s the only way that you really get under the issue of gun violence in the community.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/hummingbird-high-altitude-climate-change">High altitudes may be a climate refuge for some birds, but not these hummingbirds</a></h4>

              
                <p>Cooler, higher locales may not be very welcoming to some hummingbirds trying to escape rising temperatures and other effects of climate change.</p>



<p>Anna’s hummingbirds live no higher than about 2,600 meters above sea level. If the birds attempt to expand their range to include higher altitudes, they may <a href="https://journals.biologists.com/jeb/article-lookup/doi/10.1242/jeb.243294">struggle to fly well in the thinner air</a>, researchers report May 26 in the <em>Journal of Experimental Biology</em>.</p>



<p>These hummingbirds have expanded their range in the past. Once only found in Southern California, the birds now live as far north as Vancouver, says Austin Spence, an ecologist at the University of California, Davis. That expansion is probably due to climate change and people using feeders to attract hummingbirds, he says.</p>





<p>Spence and colleagues collected 26 Anna’s hummingbirds (<em>Calypte anna</em>) from different elevations in the birds’ natural range in California. The team transported the birds to an aviary about 1,200 meters above sea level and measured their metabolic rate when hovering. After relocating the hummingbirds to a field station at 3,800 meters altitude, the researchers let the birds rest for at least 12 hours and then measured that rate again.</p>



<p>The rate was 37 percent lower, on average, at the higher elevation than the aviary, even though the birds should have been <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/trove-hummingbird-flight-data-reveals-secrets-nimble-flying">working harder to stay aloft in the thinner air</a> (<em>SN: 2/8/18</em>). At higher altitudes, hovering, which takes a lot of energy compared with other forms of flight, is more challenging and requires even more energy, Spence says. The decrease in metabolic rate shows that the birds’ hovering performance was suffering, he says. “Low oxygen and low air pressure may be holding them back as they try to move upslope.”</p>



<p>Additional work is needed to see whether the birds might be able to better adjust if given weeks or months to acclimate to the conditions at gradually higher altitudes.</p>

                <p><strong>Author: </strong>Roheena Anand, Executive Director, PLOS Global Publishing Development</p>



<p>PLOS has made big leaps in the past year with the <a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2021/04/launching-new-journals-2021/">launch of five new journals</a>, piloting <a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2022/01/open-access-doesnt-need-apcs-part-1/">business models</a> that will make Open Access publishing more equitable and expanding our global footprint in locally responsible ways to get closer to researchers.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Our collaboration with the<a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2022/03/advancing-open-science-in-africa-three-organizations-collaborate-to-increase-awareness-and-education/"> African Association of Universities (AAU) and the Training Centre in Communication (TCC Africa)</a> is a visible way we are moving our mission forward and including the broadest range of voices, globally.&nbsp;</p>



<p>On the 26th April, 2022, we publicly launched this collaboration via a webinar for Presidents, Vice Chancellors, Rectors, Deputy Vice Chancellors, Directors of Research and Directors of Libraries of African Universities. Our partnership will consist of a series of regional workshops across the African continent, focusing on increasing awareness and providing training around Open Science practices and Open Access publishing.&nbsp;</p>



<p>More than 60 leaders from African institutions were in attendance at the launch event. There was a vibrant panel of speakers, covering both global and local Open Science perspectives and initiatives. The program included representatives from UNESCO, the International Science Council, the African Open Science Platform and the African Librarian and Information Associations &amp; Institutions, thereby reflecting a broad range of stakeholder perspectives within the scholarly communication ecosystem.&nbsp;</p>



<p>However, importantly, we heard from the attending institutional leaders in breakout sessions focussed on the challenges of adoption of Open Science and Open Access mandates within their institutions.</p>



<p>We asked&nbsp;</p>



<ul><li>What are the impediments to adopting Open Science mandates/policies in your institutions?</li><li>What needs to change to allow adoption and implementation of these mandates/policies?</li><li>What are the next steps for you? And what timelines are necessary to take these steps?&nbsp;</li></ul>



<p>What we learned will help us to shape the upcoming regional workshops to ensure they can provide value to local participants and provide a forum to collaboratively progress Open Science.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Some of the main takeaways from these discussions were:&nbsp;</p>



<ul><li>There is still a lack of awareness overall on what Open Science is, and the implications it has for stakeholders within the scholarly communication ecosystem.&nbsp;</li><li>Particularly, many misconceptions exist around Open Science and Open Access, e.g. the credibility of open peer review. Their benefits need to be clearer for stakeholders: authors, readers, as well as institutional stakeholders such as the Research Offices.&nbsp;</li><li>Academic libraries/librarians are often active in advocating for Open Science and Open Access within their institutions; therefore their involvement is and will be key in progressing adoption. They are, of course, well versed in these topics from their discussions with publishers and their roles with institutional repositories.</li><li>There are <a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2022/02/open-access-doesnt-need-apcs-part-ii-global-equity/">concerns around cost</a> (article publication charges) and intellectual property rights: <a href="https://plos.org/open-science/why-open-access/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">if material is open, how can we ensure it is not subject to abuse/manipulation</a></li><li>Incentives for practicing Open Science are not embedded within research assessment and career progression</li></ul>



<p>Our aim with collaborations like these is to ensure the co-creation of paths to Open Science that work for diverse communities and do not simply extend existing power structures. Our work is ongoing and global: we have recently announced a partnership with <a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2022/05/advancing-open-science-in-africa-three-organizations-collaborate-to-implement-open-science-principles-in-seven-partner-states/">EASTECO</a> in Africa, we have established PLOS GmbH in Berlin, and are exploring options in Asia and Latin America to help bring us closer to researchers and other stakeholder communities at the local level.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/monkeypox-outbreak-symptoms-vaccine">4 answers to key questions about the monkeypox outbreak</a></h4>

              
                <p>An outbreak of monkeypox has some people worried that the world is on the brink of another pandemic. That’s not likely, experts say.</p>



<p>The concern has been fueled by more than 300 confirmed or suspected cases of the disease cropping up in 21 countries outside Africa, where the disease is endemic, since May 7. It’s the most widespread outbreak of the disease, which causes flulike <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/poxvirus/monkeypox/response/2022/index.html?CDC_AA_refVal=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cdc.gov%2Fpoxvirus%2Fmonkeypox%2Foutbreak%2Fcurrent.html">symptoms</a>, such as fever, headaches and body aches, as well as profound weakness, back pain, swollen lymph nodes and rashes that erupt into pus-filled blisters. And <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1CEBhao3rMe-qtCbAgJTn5ZKQMRFWeAeaiXFpBY3gbHE/edit#gid=0">more cases are being added daily to a database</a> maintained by Global.health, a group that tracks infectious diseases.</p>





<p>Spain, Portugal, Canada and England have recorded most of the cases. In the United States, one person each in Massachusetts, California and New York City and two in Utah have been confirmed to have monkeypox, and four others are confirmed to have <em>Orthopoxvirus</em> infections, the genus that includes monkeypox and smallpox. Those cases — one in New York City and Washington state and two in Florida — are presumed to be monkeypox and are undergoing confirmation at the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.</p>



<p>Monkeypox spreads through close contact. “Anyone — anyone — can develop and spread monkeypox infection,” John Brooks, a medical epidemiologist at the CDC said May 23 during a <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/media/releases/2022/a0523-monkeypox.html">news briefing</a>. But “many of those affected in the current global outbreak identify as gay or bisexual men.”</p>



<p>Some of those cases have been <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-10849239/Monkeypox-outbreak-sparked-sex-two-raves-Belgium-Spain-expert-warns.html">linked to a Pride celebration and a sauna</a> in Spain, and a fetish festival in Belgium. CDC officials hope to raise awareness of the sometimes-deadly disease ahead of June, Pride month in the United States and many other countries, Brooks said.</p>



<p>Right now, men who have sex with men may be at greater risk of contracting the virus, but “infectious diseases don’t care about borders or social networks,” Brooks said. Most people are at low risk of catching monkeypox, but should still be aware that it is circulating in the community, he said.</p>



<p>“There’s no need for panic. There’s no need for fear, and there’s no need to stigmatize anyone who has this disease,” Adesola Yinka-Ogunleye, an epidemiologist at the Institute for Global Health at University College London and a monkeypox expert with the Nigeria Centre for Disease Control.</p>



<p>But with cases on the rise, here’s what to know.</p>



<h4>What is monkeypox?</h4>



<p>Monkeypox is a DNA virus in the <em>Orthopoxvirus</em> genus, which includes smallpox, cowpox and camelpox. It is not a new disease, says Yinka-Ogunleye. The virus was first discovered in monkeys in 1958. The first human case appeared in 1970.</p>



<p>Mostly, monkeypox is a disease humans catch from animals. That’s what happened in the United States in 2003 when 47 people in the Midwest got <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/domestic-disease-exotic-pets-bring-pathogens-home">monkeypox from pet prairie dogs</a> that had been housed with infected rodents from West Africa (<em>SN: 06/11/03</em>).</p>



<p>There are two different types, or clades, of monkeypox. The more deadly type is the Central African or Congo Basin clade, which sickens hundreds of people each year in Congo and the Central African Republic. That clade, which kills about 10 percent of people it infects, hasn’t spread outside the region where it is normally found, Yinka-Ogunleye says. &nbsp;</p>



<p>The West African clade is the one behind the current global outbreak. The disease it causes tends to be milder, killing about 1 percent to 3.6 percent of infected people.</p>



<h4>How did the current outbreak start?</h4>



<p>The outbreak is the latest resurgence of monkeypox, Yinka-Ogunleye says. “Before 2017, it used to be known as a rare disease,” she says. Fewer than 10 cases had popped up in Western Africa before then. For instance, Nigeria hadn’t had a case since 1978. But then <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6004876/">a 2017 outbreak</a> there caused 42 confirmed cases and 146 suspected cases, she and colleagues reported in 2018 in <em>Emerging Infectious Diseases</em>.</p>



<p>The researchers found evidence that the virus was being passed person-to-person through close contact with family members, though most cases probably came from animals. No one knows which animals are the reservoirs for monkeypox, though several rodents and other small animals are suspected to carry the virus.</p>

<p>Since 2017, Nigeria has had sporadic cases of monkeypox, mostly in urban areas, she says. The country has had 46 cases in 2022 as of April 30.</p>



<p>From time to time, travelers have carried monkeypox from Nigeria to other countries, but those have been mainly isolated cases. This outbreak may also have started with a traveler.</p>



<p>Genetic evidence from viruses isolated from patients in Portugal, the United Kingdom and the United States suggests that <a href="https://virological.org/t/multi-country-outbreak-of-monkeypox-virus-genetic-divergence-and-first-signs-of-microevolution/806">the multinational outbreak may have had a single source</a>, researchers from Portugal reported May 23 at Virological.org.</p>



<p>“Our virus definitely comes from Portugal,” says Philippe Selhorst, a virologist at the Institute of Tropical Medicine in Antwerp, Belgium, who posted the <a href="https://virological.org/t/belgian-case-of-monkeypox-virus-linked-to-outbreak-in-portugal/801">genetic makeup of the monkeypox virus from a Belgian patient</a> to Virological.org on May 20. The DNA sequence of the virus is very similar to ones from Portugal. The patient had traveled to Lisbon shortly before developing a rash, further solidifying the link. &nbsp;</p>



<p>Because monkeypox has DNA as its genetic material, it mutates more slowly than RNA viruses, such as dengue or SARS-CoV-2, the coronavirus that causes COVID-19. “I would expect all cases … in the outbreak to be very similar,” Selhorst says.</p>



<p>Still, virologists have noted mutations in the virus taken from different patients. That’s to be expected. “There’s always going to be differences between viruses,” he says. “The question is: ‘Is that difference relevant?’” Nothing in the viral DNA indicates that the virus has mutated to spread more easily from person-to-person, Selhorst says.</p>



<h4>How is the virus spreading?</h4>



<p>This outbreak seems to be driven by human-to-human transmission. “This virus has used a sexual network to spread around the world,” says Amesh Adalja, an infectious diseases physician and a senior scholar at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security.</p>



<p>That doesn’t mean monkeypox is a sexually transmitted disease — one that is passed through semen or other bodily fluids exchanged during sex, he says. “You can catch the flu if you make out with somebody, and people kiss during sex, but that doesn’t make influenza a sexually transmitted infection.” Similarly, close skin-to-skin contact during sex can spread monkeypox.</p>



<p>People infected with monkeypox may not have a visible rash, but could have lesions in their mouth or throats that harbor the virus and may pass the infection through saliva, the CDC’s Brooks said. Selhorst and colleagues are collecting semen and other body fluids from people infected with monkeypox to see if it is possible for the virus to be sexually transmitted.</p>



<p>In this outbreak, rashes have appeared first in people’s groin and anal regions, and have been mistaken for herpes or other STDs, Brooks said during the news briefing. And monkeypox cases are sometimes confused with chicken pox, Yinka-Ogunleye says. Doctors need to be aware that a <a href="https://www.acpjournals.org/doi/10.7326/M22-1581">patient with a rash may have something more exotic</a>, Adalja and Hopkins colleague Tom Inglesby warned May 23 in the <em>Annals of Internal Medicine</em>. If monkeypox is suspected, doctors should contact their state or local health department.</p>



<h4>How can the outbreak be stopped?</h4>



<p>In Nigeria, monkeypox outbreaks are controlled by isolating infected people and tracing close contacts, Yinka-Ogunleye says. Vaccines and antiviral medications are not available there for limiting the disease’s impact or spread, she says. Most of the time medication is not needed, as the body eventually clears the virus on its own, but people may be given other drugs as part of supportive care.</p>



<p>In Europe and the United States, close contacts of infected people may be vaccinated with either <a href="https://www.fda.gov/vaccines-blood-biologics/vaccines/acam2000">ACAM2000, an older vaccine against smallpox</a>, or with a newer vaccine called Jynneos. Made by vaccine company Bavarian Nordic, <a href="https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/fda-approves-first-live-non-replicating-vaccine-prevent-smallpox-and-monkeypox">Jynneos was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration</a> in 2019 for use against smallpox and monkeypox. That vaccine has fewer side effects than the older vaccine and is safer for people with eczema or weakened immune systems.</p>

<p>More than 1,000 doses of Jynneos are available in the United States’ Strategic National Stockpile, Jennifer McQuiston, deputy director of the CDC’s Division of High Consequence Pathogens and Pathology said during the CDC news briefing. And the company expects to produce more soon. More than 100 million doses of the older vaccine are available.</p>



<p>So far, cases in this outbreak have been mild. But two antiviral drugs, called brincidofovir and <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/fda-approves-first-smallpox-treatment-tpoxx">tecovirimat, developed against smallpox</a> might be used to treat severe monkeypox cases (<em>SN: 5/2/18</em>).</p>



<p>Most of the evidence that the drugs will work against monkeypox come from animal studies. But in <a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/laninf/article/PIIS1473-3099(22)00228-6/fulltext">a tiny study in the United Kingdom</a>, three people who got brincidofovir as monkeypox treatment developed liver problems and had to be taken off the drug, researchers report May 24 in <em>Lancet Infectious Diseases</em>. One person given tecovirimat spent only 10 days in the hospital, compared with six other patients who stayed in the hospital between 22 and 39 days because they were still producing virus. Those numbers are too small to draw any conclusions about the treatment’s effectiveness.</p>



<p>People previously vaccinated against smallpox may still have some protection against monkeypox, too, says Aaron Glatt, an infectious diseases epidemiologist at Mt. Sinai South Nassau in Oceanside, N.Y., and a spokesperson for the Infectious Diseases Society of America. But those numbers are dwindling. Smallpox was declared eradicated in 1980 and most countries stopped vaccinating against the virus in the 1970s. That means many people 50 and younger have no immunity to smallpox or monkeypox.</p>



<p>“This is a negative to the eradication of smallpox,” he says. “But in the overall scheme of things, it’s a positive that we eradicated smallpox. Even if we have a handful of monkeypox cases as a consequence of not vaccinating for smallpox, it is [still] a very, very good exchange.”</p>

                <p>This week on Journal Club session Yi Sun will talk about a paper &quot;On Projection Methods for Functional Time Series Forecasting&quot;.</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>Two nonparametric methods are presented for forecasting functional time series
(FTS). The FTS we observe is a curve at a discrete-time point. We address both
one-step-ahead forecasting and dynamic updating. Dynamic updating is a forward
prediction of the unobserved segment of the most recent curve. Among the two
proposed methods, the first one is a straightforward adaptation to FTS of the
k-nearest neighbors methods for univariate time series forecasting. The second
one is based on a selection of curves, termed the curve envelope, that aims to
be representative in shape and magnitude of the most recent functional
observation, either a whole curve or the observed part of a partially observed
curve. In a similar fashion to k-nearest neighbors and other projection methods
successfully used for time series forecasting, we &quot;project&quot; the k-nearest
neighbors and the curves in the envelope for forecasting. In doing so, we keep
track of the next period evolution of the curves. The methods are applied to
simulated data, daily electricity demand, and NOx emissions and provide
competitive results with and often superior to several benchmark predictions.
The approach offers a model-free alternative to statistical methods based on
FTS modeling to study the cyclic or seasonal behavior of many FTS.</p>

                <p><em>By</em> <a href="https://twitter.com/mattbwarren">Matthew Warren</a></p>



<p>It’s really common to start yawning after seeing someone else do it.  You might even be yawning right now, just reading about it. But we also instinctively know that there’s something a bit rude about yawning: we’re less likely to show this “yawn contagion” when we’re being watched, for instance. And even when we do yawn in the presence of others, we’ll often cover our mouth.</p>



<p>Why does yawning carry this stigma? The obvious explanation is that yawning indicates that we are tired or bored, and we might not want to make others feel like they are the source of that boredom (even if they are!). But the authors of a <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0191886922001994?dgcid=rss_sd_all">new study</a> in <em>Personality and Individual Differences </em>have another intriguing theory: we dislike yawning because it can be a sign of disease.</p>



<span id="more-46312"></span>



<p>There is some evidence that yawning is related to disease, note Mitch Brown from the University of Arkansas and colleagues. Certain neurological diseases can lead to abnormal yawning, for example, and <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0031938417303049">yawning may become more frequent</a> as someone develops a fever (some researchers argue that one of the purposes of yawning is to cool the brain, though <a href="https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20140811-warning-this-may-make-you-yawn">this theory is contentious</a>). Yawns can also indicate fatigue, which is often brought on by illness. The team also points out that covering our mouth hardly hides the fact that we are yawning — in fact, it might even draw attention to it. So perhaps it is more akin to covering our mouths during a cough or sneeze: an action performed to avoid transmitting disease.</p>



<p>To see whether people think of yawning as a disease cue, the team asked 196 American undergraduates to complete various questionnaires. These included measures of their aversion to germs generally and fear of Covid in particular. They also indicated the extent to which they felt disgust in various scenarios, including those related to pathogens (for example, “Accidentally touching a person’s bloody cut”). Finally, participants rated how much they stigmatised yawns, as well as sneezes, coughs, and hiccoughs, by indicating how rude it was to perform that bodily function in front of others and how important it was to cover your mouth when doing it.</p>



<p>The team found that coughing and sneezing carried a higher degree of stigma than yawning, which in turn was stigmatised more than hiccoughing. But importantly, people’s levels of pathogen-related disgust and aversion to germs both predicted <em>how much</em> they stigmatised these bodily functions. Those who scored higher on these measures showed more stigmatisation of yawning, as well as coughing and sneezing (only aversion to germs was related to stigmatisation of hiccoughs).</p>



<p>The researchers argue that this shows we do indeed see yawning as a disease cue. The fact that people who are particularly concerned about disease and germs are more likely to stigmatise yawning — as well as clearer indicators of disease like sneezing and coughing — suggests they may see yawns as potential threats to their health. Fear of Covid didn’t further increase people’s stigmatisation of yawning, and the researchers suggest this shows that the stigma around yawning has “ancestral roots” rather than just cropping up during a pandemic.</p>



<p>However, there could be other explanations for the results. Perhaps people who are concerned about germs would rather avoid someone who is yawning not because it suggests they are sick, but simply because they don’t want to be breathed on. Or maybe these people have an aversion to seeing or thinking about bodily functions in general, whether or not these are actually related to disease. Further studies are needed to disentangle all of these possibilities before researchers can definitively conclude that we use yawns as a disease cue.</p>



<p>The study also doesn’t rule out other reasons that yawning carries a stigma. Yawning can of course indicate boredom and may be interpreted as disrespectful, so covering our mouths may simply be a non-verbal way to communicate that we’re not trying to be rude — even if it doesn’t really hide the yawn. There’s clearly a lot more work to be done to understand the purpose and meaning of this seemingly simple reflex.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/amazon-lasers-lidar-ancient-urban-system-casarabe-bolivia">Lasers reveal ancient urban sprawl hidden in the Amazon</a></h4>

              
                <p>A massive urban landscape that contained interconnected campsites, villages, towns and monumental centers thrived in the Amazon rainforest more than 600 years ago.</p>



<p>In what is now Bolivia, members of the Casarabe culture built an urban system that included <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-022-04780-4">straight, raised causeways running for several kilometers, canals and reservoirs</a>, researchers report May 25 in <em>Nature</em>.</p>



<p>Such low-density urban sprawl from pre-Columbian times was previously unknown in the Amazon or anywhere else in South America, say archaeologist Heiko Prümers of the German Archaeological Institute in Bonn and colleagues. Rather than constructing huge cities densely packed with people, a substantial Casarabe population spread out in a network of small to medium-sized settlements that incorporated plenty of open space for farming, the scientists conclude.</p>





<p>Airborne lasers peered through dense trees and ground cover to identify structures from that low-density urban network that have long eluded land-based archaeologists.</p>



<p>Earlier excavations indicated that Casarabe maize farmers, fishers and hunters inhabited an area of 4,500 square kilometers. For about a century, researchers have known that Casarabe people fashioned elaborate pottery and constructed large earthen mounds, causeways and ponds. But these finds were located at isolated forest sites that are difficult to excavate, leaving the reasons for mound building and the nature of Casarabe society, which existed from about the year 500 to 1400, a mystery.</p>



<p>Prümers’ team opted to look through the Amazon’s lush cover from above, aiming to find relics of human activity that typically remain hidden even after careful ground surveys. The scientists used a helicopter carrying special equipment to fire laser pulses at the Amazon forest as well as stretches of grassland. Those laser pulses reflect data from the Earth’s surface. This technique, called light detection and ranging, or lidar for short, enables researchers to map the contours of now-obscured structures.</p>



<p>Looking at the new lidar images, “it is obvious that the mounds are platforms and pyramids standing on artificial terraces at the center of well-planned settlements,” Prümers says.</p>



<p>Prümers’ team conducted lidar surveys over six parts of ancient Casarabe territory. The lidar data revealed 26 sites, 11 of them previously unknown.</p>



<p>Two sites, Cotoca and Landívar, are much larger than the rest. Both settlements feature rectangular and U-shaped platform mounds and cone-shaped earthen pyramids atop artificial terraces. Curved moats and defensive walls border each site. Causeways radiate out from Cotoca and Landívar in all directions, connecting those primary sites to smaller sites with fewer platform mounds that then link up to what were probably small campsites or areas for specialized activities, such as butchering prey.</p>



<p>The Casarabe society’s network of settlements joins other ancient and present-day examples of low-density urban sprawl around the world, says archaeologist Roland Fletcher of the University of Sydney. &nbsp;These sites raise questions about whether only places with centralized governments that ruled over people who were packed into neighborhoods on narrow streets, such as 6,000-year-old Mesopotamian metropolises, can be defined as cities.</p>



<p>Some past urban settlements organized around crop growing spanned up to 1,000 square kilometers or more in tropical regions. These include locales such as <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/lasers-unveil-secrets-and-mysteries-angkor-wat">Southeast Asia’s Greater Angkor</a> roughly 700 to 800 years ago and <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/laser-mapping-shows-surprising-complexity-maya-civilization">interconnected Maya sites in Central America</a> dating to at least 2,300 years ago (<em>SN: 4/29/16</em>; <em>SN: 9/27/18</em>). Today, extended areas outside large cities, especially in Southeast Asia, mix industrial and agricultural activities over tens of thousands of kilometers.</p>



<p>Clusters of interconnected Casarabe settlements ranged in area from 100 square kilometers to more than 500 square kilometers. Spread-out settlements of comparable area include <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/ancient-urban-megasites-may-reshape-history-first-cities">6,000-year-old sites from Eastern Europe’s Trypillia culture</a> (<em>SN: 2/19/20</em>).</p>



<p>Tropical forests that have gone largely unexplored, such as Central Africa’s Congo Basin, probably hosted other early forms of low-density urban development, Fletcher predicts.</p>



<p>Only further excavations guided by lidar evidence can begin to untangle the size of the Casarabe population, Prümers says. Whether primary Casarabe sites represented seats of power in states with upper and lower classes also remains unknown, he adds.</p>



<p>Casarabe culture’s urban sprawl must have encompassed a considerable number of people in the centuries before the Spanish arrived and Indigenous population numbers plummeted, largely due to diseases, forced labor and slavery, says archaeologist John Walker of the University of Central Florida in Orlando.</p>



<p>Whatever Casarabe honchos had in mind as their tropical settlement network spread, he says, “we may have to set aside some of our strongly held ideas about what the Amazon is, and what a city is, to better understand what happened.”</p>

                <p><em>By</em> <a href="https://emmayoung.net/">Emma Young</a></p>



<p>Letting your mind wander while you’re meant to be working on a task doesn’t sound like a particularly good idea. Indeed, psychologists have viewed mind-wandering in this context as a failing — specifically, a failure of executive control to maintain focus. Evidence that mind-wandering worsens performance on tasks that tap into working memory, for example, supports this idea. However, the full picture is not so neat…</p>



<p>Though older adults generally have poorer executive control than younger people, they tend to report <em>less</em> mind wandering. And some studies that required young adults to switch between various tasks have found that mind-wandering made no difference to their performance. This is &#8220;perplexing&#8221;, note the authors of a <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1053810022000678?dgcid=rss_sd_all">new paper</a> in <em>Consciousness and Cognition</em> — at least in the context of traditional theories. But Yi-Sheng Wong at the University of Otago, New Zealand, and colleagues report findings that support an alternative idea: that people who have a tendency to mind-wander enjoy greater &#8220;cognitive flexibility&#8221; — that is, they can shift more easily from one type of cognitive challenge to another.</p>



<span id="more-46292"></span>



<p>The team studied 79 undergraduate students, who were repeatedly shown a circle or a triangle on a screen. The shape was either large or small, and red or blue. In the first set of trials, the participants were told which aspect of the image — its shape, colour or size — they were to report on, via a keyboard, as quickly and accurately as possible. Sometimes this would be the same as the previous trial, but sometimes it would change so they were focusing on colour in one trial, say, and size the next. In the second, voluntary-switch set of trials, the participants could choose if and when they wanted to change — to start responding to colour instead of shape, for example. After they had finished both sets of trials, they completed questionnaires that assessed mind-wandering, among other things.</p>



<p>The team found that participants who reported having a relatively high tendency to spontaneously mind wander in daily life also rated themselves as having generally poorer attentional control. They were also more likely to have thought about things other than the appearance of the shapes while doing the experiment. However, when the team looked at the participants’ reaction times, this group didn’t do any worse on the voluntary-switch set of trials, and actually did <em>better</em> on trials where they were forced to suddenly change from reporting on one aspect of the image to another.</p>



<p>The team proposes that those who mind-wandered more put themselves in a &#8220;set-switching&#8221; mode, and this allowed them to respond better to shifts in task instructions. Their mind-wandering may, then, have enabled greater cognitive flexibility. According to this view, depending on the nature of the task, mind-wandering may indeed sometimes carry costs, but at other times, it can in fact be helpful.</p>



<p>It’s worth stressing that this study had various limitations, not least that it was done on young, overwhelmingly female participants in a <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2018/12/10/psychology-research-is-still-fixated-on-a-tiny-fraction-of-humans-heres-how-to-fix-that/">WEIRD context</a>, which clearly restricts the generalisability of the results. Clearly, more work is needed to explore these ideas. But, the team concludes, this “first step towards highlighting the relevance of cognitive flexibility in mind wandering may help researchers towards gaining a more nuanced and holistic understanding of past findings.”</p>



<p>It could also represent a useful step towards a better understanding of the causes and impacts of mind wandering generally. Alongside the data on variations with age, some patient groups report heightened levels of mind-wandering (including people with ADHD), while others report much less (people with Alzheimer’s or Parkinson’s disease, for example.) A better understanding of mind-wandering could help with understanding aspects of these conditions, as well as the experiences of healthy people in everyday life.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/headbutt-brain-damage-musk-ox-tau-dementia">Headbutts hurt the brain, even for a musk ox</a></h4>

              
                <p>Punishing headbutts damage the brains of musk oxen. That observation, made for the first time and reported May 17 in&nbsp;<em>Acta Neuropathologica</em>, suggests that a life full of bell-ringing clashes is not without consequences, even in animals built to bash.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Although a musk ox looks like a dirty dust mop on four tiny hooves, it’s formidable. When charging, it can reach speeds up to 60 kilometers an hour before ramming its head directly into an oncoming head. People expected that musk oxen brains could withstand these merciless forces largely unscathed, “that they were magically perfect,” says Nicole Ackermans of the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai in New York City. “No one actually checked.”&nbsp;</p>





<p>In fact, the brains of three wild musk oxen (two females and one male) showed signs of extensive damage, Ackermans and her colleagues found. The damage was similar to what’s seen in people with&nbsp;<a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/cte-brain-damage-football-players-top-science-stories-2017-yir">chronic traumatic encephalopathy</a>, a disorder known to be caused by repetitive head hits (<em>SN: 12/13/17</em>). In the musk ox brains, a form of a protein called tau had accumulated in patterns that suggested brain bashing was to blame.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In an unexpected twist, the brains of the females, who hit heads less frequently than males, were worse off than the male’s. The male body, with its heavier skull, stronger neck muscles and forehead fat pads, may cushion the blows to the brain, the researchers suspect.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The results may highlight an evolutionary balancing act; the animals can endure just enough brain damage to allow them to survive and procreate. High-level brainwork may not matter much, Ackermans says. “Their day-to-day life is not super complicated.”&nbsp;</p>

                <p>Written by&nbsp;<a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/author/lmorton/">Lindsay Morton</a></p>



<p>Just over a year ago, <em>PLOS Computational Biology</em> introduced <a href="https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1008867">a new journal policy</a> requiring authors to make public any code directly related to the results of their article upon publication of the work. We look forward to sharing the outcomes of the policy in a future post. Today, we explore the drivers behind this policy change, including community demand, research integrity, and the way we consume information.</p>



<h2>The importance of Open Code</h2>



<p>Like all methodological tools and documentation, researcher-generated scripts and code are <a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2021/07/methods-as-scientific-asset/">scientific assets</a> with real and lasting value to the research community. Augmenting a research article with Open Code contextualizes results and enhances understanding, supports <a href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/full/10.1073/pnas.1708290115">reproducibility</a> and <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00265-021-03036-x">reuse</a>, and increases efficiency across the entire scientific ecosystem.</p>



<p>Researchers certainly appreciate the strength and relevance of open code. In a <a href="https://osf.io/tys8p/">recent survey</a> of computational biology researchers, 75% of respondents reported looking at code associated with articles they are reading, with 39% consulting code &lsquo;frequently&rsquo; or &lsquo;very frequently.&rsquo; When asked why they looked at code, 70% of respondents expressed a desire to improve their understanding of the study, and 48% hoped to reuse or adapt the code. Even before the introduction of the code policy in 2021, <em>PLOS Computational Biology</em> authors voluntarily shared code at a high rate (61% in 2020), indicating that this community not only consumes code, but also actively contributes to it.</p>



<p>Jason Papin, co-Editor-in-Chief of <em>PLOS Computational Biology</em> nicely summarizes the sentiments among researchers in the discipline. &ldquo;Code is the life-blood of research in our field. In order to truly build on the discoveries and advances in our computational biology, we must be able to build on the work of others. Computational models that are readily accessible and shared can be probed in new ways to further drive biological insight; the implementation of newly developed methods with readily accessible code can be applied to new data sets to generate new hypotheses.&rdquo;</p>



<p>Making the decision to share code <a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/16800">signals confidence and integrity</a> on the part of the authors, which in turn supports trust in the community. It suggests that the authors <em>want </em>their work to be scrutinized, and understood on its real merits. And that they are ready and willing to open doors for fellow researchers by enabling them to more easily reuse or adapt scripts for their own studies, helping the whole field to advance more quickly.</p>



<h2>Code as the crux of research</h2>



<p>In a recent <a href="https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1009651">perspective article</a> published in <em>PLOS Computational Biology</em>, DuPree and colleagues draw a distinction between the scholarly article, which they argue functions as a kind of preview or entrypoint to the research, and the <em>real </em>scholarly work. That is, the methods researchers develop (in this case software and code), and the data they gather and analyze in order to produce a result. It&rsquo;s this data and code which forms the core of the research, the fulcrum on which everything else turns. For that reason, code not only deserves a place in the literature, it is required in order to fully understand and appreciate the scholarship.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Just as importantly, code shouldn&rsquo;t be flattened or diminished in order to fit within the confines of a classic research article. Instead, it&rsquo;s the joint responsibility of publishers and the scientific community to search out the most effective ways to capture and communicate different types of knowledge&mdash;whether that means rich text and linking, integrated and interactive research objects, or other tools.</p>



<p>Reflecting on DuPree et al&rsquo;s perspective, Feilim Mac Gabhann, co-Editor-in-Chief of <em>PLOS Computational Biology</em> noted, &ldquo;the concept of integrating more complex research products into publications has been around for some time&mdash;from embedding videos in papers to interactive visualizations and runnable code&mdash;and given some recent progress in the field this seemed like a timely perspective. Particularly in relation to computational biology, which generates very shareable and interactive materials, and has a culture of sharing and open science that matches PLOS&rsquo; mission. Computational biology and computational sciences more broadly can be at the vanguard of enhancing or rethinking what a research paper can be and can include, which enhances scientific communication as well as the reach and uptake of the tools developed.&rdquo;</p>



<h2>Why now?</h2>



<p>Why is Open Code so important to researchers today? For that matter, why have methods documentation and data, in all their varied forms and formats, risen to such prominence in recent years?&nbsp;</p>



<p>There are many reasons, of course. A growing awareness that published research may not be reproducible. The lived experience of researchers attempting to replicate results, conduct systematic reviews, or adapt methods for use in another study. Among the most intriguing relates to the increasing size and complexity of scientific investigations, and our evolving standards for burden of proof.</p>



<p>Nikola Stikov of the University of Montreal explains, &ldquo;work has gotten more collaborative, the barriers to new knowledge are higher, and in many fields, ideas are getting harder to find&hellip;so I believe the burden of proof is higher, and as a result code and data need to enter the picture.&rdquo;</p>

<h2>Looking ahead</h2>



<p>Each editor and researcher we spoke with pointed out that, when it comes to Open Code, simple linking is just the beginning of what&rsquo;s possible. From code notebooks, to repositories, to containerization, there are myriad ways to preserve, share and understand Open Code, prompting us to consider what an optimized, modern research article might look like.</p>



<p>At the same time, as popular as Open Code is in computation fields, there is still a long way to go before it becomes generally accepted best practice across the scientific landscape.</p>
