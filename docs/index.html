<p>A certain amount of worrying is a normal part of life, especially these days with barely a moment passing without some disconcerting headline landing in your news feed. But for some people, their worrying reaches pathological levels. They just can’t stop wondering “What if …?”. It becomes distressing and feels out of control. In the formal jargon, they would likely be diagnosed with Generalised Anxiety Disorder, but excessive worrying is also a part of other conditions like panic disorder. There are many factors that contribute to anxiety problems in general, but <a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0301051116300965?dgcid=raven_sd_via_email">a new review</a> in <em>Biological Psychology</em> homes in on the cognitive and emotional factors that specifically contribute to prolonged bouts of worry. Its take-home points make an interesting read for anyone who considers themselves a worrier, and for therapists, the review highlights some approaches to help anxious clients get a hold of their excessive worrying.</p>
<p><span id="more-18521"></span></p>
<p>The review authors, Graham Davey and Frances Meeten at the University of Sussex and the Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology and Neuroscience, explain that what gets many pathological worriers worrying in the first place is that they seem to be highly vigilant to any sources of threat and danger, and if there’s any ambiguity about whether a situation is threatening or not, they will tend to interpret it as being dangerous. If they haven’t yet heard from their daughter today, for instance, the problem worrier will not only notice this fact, they will also contemplate that it’s because she’s in trouble, rather than simply busy.</p>
<p>Studies have shown the causal role that these attentional biases seem to have by testing what happens when people are trained instead to pay more attention to positive aspects of situations, or to interpret ambiguous situations more positively. Asked to spend time after the training sitting quietly, focused on their breathing, worriers who’ve had the training report fewer intrusive worries compared with control participants.</p>
<p>Once a worry bout kicks in, one of the things that keeps it going in problem worriers is their deep held belief that worry is actually a good thing. This doesn’t make much sense at first. How can excessive worriers think worry is good when they find it so distressing? But while they find the worrying distressing and upsetting, and it feels out of control, research shows they also believe that it can help prevent bad things from happening, that it will help them be prepared for bad outcomes, and that it aids problem solving.</p>
<p>Related to this, problem worriers tend to have a kind of perfectionist approach to worrying. They think they can’t stop worrying until they’ve finished, in the sense of working through every eventuality and solving every problem. Less anxious people, in contrast, will tend to follow a principle of stopping worrying once they don’t feel like it anymore. Teaching pathological worriers to change their approach, to learn to stop worrying once they had enough of it, has been shown to prevent them from getting stuck in such long worry bouts.</p>
<p>Another key factor is low mood. Problem worriers tend to experience more negative moods, which are known to encourage a more analytical thinking style. In turn, this lays the ground for an overly zealous, perfectionist worry style that is in a sense impossible satisfy and leads to more distress and anxiety. Pathological worriers also tend to use their ongoing negative mood as a barometer for whether their worrying has been successful. The fact that they still feel down and anxious tells them that they’ve yet to anticipate or prepare for every disconcerting eventuality. Using “mood as information” in this way creates a kind of cognitive and emotional trap that propagates yet more worry.</p>
<p>You should seek professional help if you feel your worrying is becoming a problem, but the review offers some simple take-aways for breaking out of occasional uncontrolled worry bouts or preventing them happening in the first place. Because of the way that negative moods contribute to the perseveration of worry bouts, for instance, simply trying to combat a generally low mood is likely to help. This may be easier said that done, but if you can lift your mood (for example through <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2016/10/21/walking-lifts-your-mood-even-when-you-dont-expect-it-to/">going for regular walks</a>), the evidence suggests a knock-on benefit will be less prolonged worrying.</p>
<p>It sounds ridiculously simple, but also thinking about the idea of stopping worrying when you’ve had enough of it, rather than when the worrying is somehow “finished” or “complete”, could be beneficial. In fact, earlier research has shown that merely learning about the cognitive and emotional factors that feed excessive worry can help some people.</p>
<p>From a therapeutic perspective, the review suggests that <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2015/11/03/attention-training-can-wire-your-brain-to-be-less-scaredy-cat/">attentional</a> <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2016/02/01/working-memory-training-could-help-beat-anxiety/">training</a> programmes (including “<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3092585/">cognitive bias modification</a>“) are likely to help prevent worry bouts from starting in the first place. Therapists could also consider engaging with anxious clients’ explicit beliefs about worrying, such as that it can prevent bad things happening or that they need to continue worrying until they’ve covered all the issues. Meanwhile, acceptance- or mindfulness-based approaches could help alleviate clients’ distress about worry, which in turn would help reduce the part that negative mood plays in prolonging a worry bout. As for where our deep-seated and sometime unhelpful beliefs about worry come from in the first place, Davey and Meeten said this is something awaiting further research.</p>

 Synthetic lethality and collateral lethality are two well-validated conceptual strategies for identifying therapeutic targets in cancers with tumour-suppressor gene deletions. Here, we explore an approach to identify potential synthetic-lethal interactions by screening mutually exclusive deletion patterns in cancer genomes. We sought to identify ‘synthetic-essential’ genes: those that are occasionally deleted in some cancers but are almost always retained in the context of a specific tumour-suppressor deficiency. We also posited that such synthetic-essential genes would be therapeutic targets in cancers that harbour specific tumour-suppressor deficiencies. In addition to known synthetic-lethal interactions, this approach uncovered the chromatin helicase DNA-binding factor CHD1 as a putative synthetic-essential gene in PTEN-deficient cancers. In PTEN-deficient prostate and breast cancers, CHD1 depletion profoundly and specifically suppressed cell proliferation, cell survival and tumorigenic potential. Mechanistically, functional PTEN stimulates the GSK3β-mediated phosphorylation of CHD1 degron domains, which promotes CHD1 degradation via the β-TrCP-mediated ubiquitination–proteasome pathway. Conversely, PTEN deficiency results in stabilization of CHD1, which in turn engages the trimethyl lysine-4 histone H3 modification to activate transcription of the pro-tumorigenic TNF–NF-κB gene network. This study identifies a novel PTEN pathway in cancer and provides a framework for the discovery of ‘trackable’ targets in cancers that harbour specific tumour-suppressor deficiencies.

 The mammalian liver consists of hexagon-shaped lobules that are radially polarized by blood flow and morphogens. Key liver genes have been shown to be differentially expressed along the lobule axis, a phenomenon termed zonation, but a detailed genome-wide reconstruction of this spatial division of labour has not been achieved. Here we measure the entire transcriptome of thousands of mouse liver cells and infer their lobule coordinates on the basis of a panel of zonated landmark genes, characterized with single-molecule fluorescence in situ hybridization. Using this approach, we obtain the zonation profiles of all liver genes with high spatial resolution. We find that more than 50% of liver genes are significantly zonated and uncover abundant non-monotonic profiles that peak at the mid-lobule layers. These include a spatial order of bile acid biosynthesis enzymes that matches their position in the enzymatic cascade. Our approach can facilitate the reconstruction of similar spatial genomic blueprints for other mammalian organs.

 Exceptionally preserved fossils provide crucial insights into extinct body plans and organismal evolution. Molluscs, one of the most disparate animal phyla, radiated rapidly during the early Cambrian period (approximately 535–520 million years ago (Ma)). The problematic fossil taxa Halkieria and Orthrozanclus (grouped in Sachitida) have been assigned variously to stem-group annelids, brachiopods, stem-group molluscs or stem-group aculiferans (Polyplacophora and Aplacophora), but their affinities have remained controversial owing to a lack of preserved diagnostic characters. Here we describe a new early sachitid, Calvapilosa kroegeri gen. et sp. nov. from the Fezouata biota of Morocco (Early Ordovician epoch, around 478 Ma). The new taxon is characterized by the presence of a single large anterior shell plate and polystichous radula bearing a median tooth and several lateral and uncinal teeth in more than 125 rows. Its flattened body is covered by hollow spinose sclerites, and a smooth, ventral girdle flanks an extensive mantle cavity. Phylogenetic analyses resolve C. kroegeri as a stem-group aculiferan together with other single-plated forms such as Maikhanella (Siphogonuchites) and Orthrozanclus; Halkieria is recovered closer to the aculiferan crown. These genera document the stepwise evolution of the aculiferan body plan from forms with a single, almost conchiferan-like shell through two-plated taxa such as Halkieria, to the eight-plated crown-group aculiferans. C. kroegeri therefore provides key evidence concerning the long debate about the crown molluscan affinities of sachitids. This new discovery strongly suggests that the possession of only a single calcareous shell plate and the presence of unmineralised sclerites are plesiomorphic (an ancestral trait) for the molluscan crown.

            <p>In an attempt to explain the internal processes governing the occurrences in the economic world, neuroeconomics is an emerging interdisciplinary field attempting to merge psychology and economic theory. Simply put, the biological basis of behavioral economics; how and why people make judgements and decisions with economic consequences in terms of simple cerebral biology. But why should we be interested? Surely considering the brain in more behaviorist, 20<sup>th</sup> century ‘black box’ terms is much more simple – input information, output decision. And whilst, arguably, many economic theories do consider human behavior and choice in such a way, psychology would argue otherwise. Neuroeconomics attempts to bridge the gap between input and output, analyzing the chemicals and structures, which provide the biological basis for individuality in processing and decision-making.</p>
<p>Whilst the majority of the cerebral cortex is in fact dedicated to the interpretation of such complex or ‘higher order’ judgment functioning, the study of the biological response is relatively limited. This is surprising, given the untold benefits to corporates and executives whom, in theory, would thrive from findings; sectors in marketing, education, health, managerial and so on, in which research into human heuristics and biases would greatly inform product, workforce, and knowledge development. So why are not all corporations capitalizing on the biological blueprints for consumer, workforce and public decision-making? One word: ethics.</p>
<p>Neuroeconomics assumes that the neurotransmission and chemical balance in cerebral areas responsible for higher order and consciousness (such as the prefrontal cortex) result in the socioemotional basis for most of our decisions. Yes, contrary to economic theory, most human decision is not rational or uniform, but relies on the illogicality of trust, affect and gratification. So how ethical is it for these processes to be manipulated for capital gain? Brain imaging techniques and genetic screening in consumers, the aging population, even Wall street traders has given us greater insight into the likelihood of particular decisions, judgment and risk taking, allowing those utilizing the information to cash in on their carefully biologically tailored advertisements, behavioral change interventions, and so on. Does this mean in years to come scientists will be able to access unconscious desires and preferences for profit? Well, yes and no.</p>
<p>Whilst the ethical implications of feeding the consumer’s biological process for preference in questionable at best, using these reductionist techniques to better inform consumer choice is not necessarily beneficial. Studies have shown that whilst initial choice in blind tasting, for example, is unconscious, contrary decisions are made based upon branding, cultural preference and so on. Given that we do tend to make decisions consciously in terms of consumption, these techniques may be somewhat redundant.</p>
<p>Moreover, to an extent, neuroeconomic study still relies on the same economic principles of assumption – this being that human brains, unfortunately for scientists, do not work in uniformity, and rather, decisions are made irrationally, regardless of the unconscious biology informing us otherwise. Therefore the direction of neuroeconomic study would do well to focus on what creates this irrationality and uniqueness in behavior – are we simply unconventional when we want just for the sake of it? Certainly research must be conducted with temporality in mind – understanding the static structure of choice and judgement with no consideration to situational influence is redundant in itself, let alone in combination with the unpredictability of individual human decision.</p>
<p>More specifically within the field of neuroeconomics, neuromarketing seems to provide the most controversy in terms of its future applications. Currently, the field aims to utilize the findings of neurological study regarding consumer choice, and aims to appeal to certain unconscious mechanisms, which govern decision boosting purchase and profit – in theory. Previous research has already attempted to determine the chemical basis of ‘trust’ (well established as oxytocin) as a powerful component in judgement and decision in terms of brand trust and familiarity. Whilst this may be a well-established marketing technique in the corporate toolbox, the contribution of chemical ‘manipulation’ certainly lends towards the unease fueling ethical qualms in the area. In the same vein, gender differences in cerebral organization is well established to predict judgment and choice behavior, and is well marketed to tailor to the different sexes, however, the thought of a brand ‘controlling’ consumers through biological means raises ethical issues in this case. Although, these techniques are well posited in countless campaigns, thus perhaps the field of neuroeconomics only provides a biological explanation for consumer behavior, which is already time-honored and utilized.</p>
<p>Regardless of the ethical implications of probing into the deepest levels of consciousness for the sake of an ad campaign, the field has many benefits, which should be considered in comparison. It must firstly be addressed, in fact, that neuroeconomics and health psychology are long lost sisters, and whilst we praise the work of psychologically informed public health campaigns, neuroeconomics must also be considered as a valuable informant. In such a way that neuroeconomics may be used as the basis to inform such behavioral psychology, it must also be considered as the biological basis for behavioral economics, providing valuable contribution to wholly effective public change for the better. Similarly, development in managerial sectors, workforce training and motivation has already proven to benefit from neuroeconomical research in terms of ‘reframing’. Neural study has indicated the more efficient work of employees when focusing on creative and emotional thinking, as opposed to logics and numerical training traditionally employed (as demonstrated by our human preference to avoid rationality in decision making). Focusing on the emotional intelligence and providing encouragement and training directed towards a more imaginative decision making process has innumerable benefits in employment satisfaction.</p>
<p>Moreover, applications of neuroeconomics to psychiatry must be considered in weighing up the pros and cons of the field. If it is possible to identify a specific genetic or chemical contribution resulting in a decline in cognitive functioning, thus ultimately leading to psychiatric disorder (with specific symptoms in impaired judgment and decision making symptoms), both fields are mutually informed. More simply, identifying such biological structures and process in neuroeconomic study better informs the neurological basis for psychiatric disorders, aiding medical or therapeutic intervention. In a similar way, the study of psychiatric disorder can be used as ‘case study’ for areas of cerebral dis-regulation and its effects on judgment and decision.</p>
<p>Whilst I do not claim even close to omniscient in the aforementioned fields of neuroscience, economics or behavioral psychology, I would dismiss the claim that neuroeconomics is a redundant area of study, but highlight the issues surrounding the biological basis for ‘controlling’ consumer behavior. Regardless, the need for further research concerning a biological model of decision is clear, with accuracy in the field’s current conclusions questionable at present.</p>

One of these pledges was to ensure that 80% of drink containers include labels detailing alcohol content, daily intake guidance and warning against drinking during pregnancy.</p>
<p>Whilst these pledges may be well intentioned, their actual effectiveness has been called into question. Researchers argue that the most effective strategies to reduce alcohol related injury are <a href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/add.12855/abstract;jsessionid=4672011288F47CCC0DD2308562874FBA.f04t02">not consistently reflected</a> in the pledges and that <a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0955395901000779">labeling is generally ineffective</a> in modifying consumer behaviors.</p>
<p>The effects of labeling on alcohol is an area that is poorly understand in general. For instance, there is considerable uncertainty over whether the labeling of lower strength alcohol products reduces alcohol consumption, with consumers purchasing these drinks over higher strength counterparts, or whether it in fact encourages higher consumption due to ‘self-licensing’. This was investigated in a <a href="https://bmcpublichealth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12889-016-3956-2">systematic review</a> published in <a href="https://bmcpublichealth.biomedcentral.com/"><em>BMC Public Health</em></a>. It found there was low quality evidence suggesting consumers’ perceptions of products could be shifted by low alcohol labeling but there was still considerable uncertainty over what the effects might be.</p>
<blockquote><p>Consumers looking at advertisements for alcohol only spent <a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1054139X07000985">an average of 7%</a> of viewing time on warning messages</p></blockquote>
<p>The apparent ineffectiveness of warning labels on alcohol products has been explored in another <a href="https://bmcpublichealth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12889-017-4055-8">recent study</a> published in <a href="https://bmcpublichealth.biomedcentral.com/"><em>BMC Public Health</em></a>. Here the authors theorized that the limited effect of warning labels may be due to consumers paying little attention to them. It has previously been shown that consumers looking at advertisements for alcohol only spent <a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1054139X07000985">an average of 7%</a> of viewing time on warning messages. Increasing attention to warning to warning labels may then be the key to increasing their effectiveness. This has been shown in bar visitors who <a href="http://www.jsad.com/doi/10.15288/jsa.1993.54.457">drank less alcohol</a> when their attention was drawn to warning labels.</p>
<p>To find out if warning labels could impact alcohol consumption on a population level, if they were made sufficiently attention grabbing, the authors devised two studies that investigated how much attention is paid to warning labels and how individual differences in drinking behaviors are associated with attention to warning labels.</p>
<h3><strong>The study</strong></h3>
<p>The authors recruited students at the University of Liverpool. In the first study, 60 participants were asked to view images of beverage containers on a screen whilst their eye movements were tracked. Students were told to pay close attention as their memories of the containers would be tested.</p>
<p>In the second study the viewing phase was proceeded by either an alcohol intervention talk to manipulate participants (120) drinking motivations or a control intervention giving study advice. The researchers also manipulated attention to alcohol packaging using brightly drawn borders on either the warning label or the branding. The participants then completed a questionnaire to asses motivations to drink in the following week.</p>
<blockquote><p>Although the alcohol intervention talk reduced attention to branding it did not increase attention to warning labels.</p></blockquote>
<p>Results of the study showed that although the alcohol intervention talk reduced attention to branding it did not increase attention to warning labels or influence motivations to reduce drinking. Study participants who viewed containers with highlighted health warnings did fixate longer on these however this did not affect drinking intentions.</p>
<p>The researchers propose that a possible reason that participants did not particularly notice the warning labels is because they only occupy 5% of the packaging. This is supported by research on warning labels in tobacco adverts which found that <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12034984?dopt=Abstract">message recall</a> was increased with larger labels. Other reasons could be that current warning labels do not show the consequences of exceeding the recommended intake and features of the labels like the “drink responsibly” message are associated with <a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0376871614009156">promoting the drink</a> and therefore seen as part of the branding.</p>
<p>In order to make alcohol warning labels more effective, the researchers call for further studies exploring the effects of label design and content on consumers’ attention to them. They also suggest that increasing the noticeability of warning labels could be achieved through plain packaging, graphic warnings and front of pack labeling which have all been shown to be effective in food and tobacco research.</p>

<p>There’s increasing recognition that our vulnerability to mental health problems isn’t just about how much we are prone to certain emotions such as anxiety and low mood, but also how we relate to those emotions. If we find them aversive and intolerable, we’re more likely to develop problems. A <a href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpp.2071/abstract">new study</a> in <em>Clinical Psychology and Psychotherapy</em> applies this principle to people’s experience of guilt and their vulnerability to Obsessive Compulsive Disorder (OCD), helping make sense of why past research has been inconsistent on whether guilt-proneness is a risk factor for OCD or not. Gabriele Melli and his colleagues provide new evidence that the inconsistent results might be because the key factor is not how much guilt you suffer, but whether you’re highly guilt-sensitive. They found that clients with OCD who said they found guilt unbearable were especially likely to have OCD symptoms related to compulsive checking, such as checking doors are locked and ovens switched off. Though preliminary, the results point to new ways to help clients with this kind of OCD.</p>
<p><span id="more-18447"></span></p>
<p>Melli and his colleagues began by creating a new scale for measuring guilt sensitivity because no such questionnaire existed. The new scale had 20 items, such as “Guilt is one of the most intolerable feelings” and “The idea of feeling guilty because I was careless makes me very anxious”.  Nearly 500 volunteers from a local community in central Italy rated their agreement or not with these items, and they completed other questionnaires tapping their tendency to experience guilt, and their levels of OCD, depression and anxiety symptoms. The results showed that guilt sensitivity is a separate concept from guilt proneness, and that it was more strongly related to checking-related OCD symptoms than depression or general anxiety.</p>
<p>Next, the researchers asked 61 clients diagnosed with OCD and 47 others diagnosed with general anxiety disorders to complete the new guilt-sensitivity questionnaire and other scales measuring their levels of anxiety and depression. The results showed there was a strong correlation between levels of guilt sensitivity and OCD symptoms related to compulsive checking, even after controlling for different levels of general anxiety and depression and obsessive beliefs, such as an irrational sense of responsibility. Moreover, guilt-sensitivity was especially high for OCD clients whose principle symptoms related to ritualistic checking.</p>
<p>“Guilt sensitivity may indeed cause individuals to be vigilant and sensitive to ways in which actions or inactions could potentially cause harm, performing checking compulsions in order to avoid, prevent, or neutralise the feared feeling of guilt,” the researchers said. This could have implications for therapy, they added, suggesting that in CBT, “cognitive restructuring should target not only inflated responsibility beliefs, but also beliefs concerning the intolerability and dangerousness of experiencing guilt.” Note, however, that the new findings were purely correlational so it’s not certain that guilt sensitivity causes OCD checking symptoms or if the symptoms lead to guilt sensitivity. It may be a bit of both. Or it’s even possible some unknown factors contribute to the symptoms and the guilt-sensitivity.</p>

            <img alt="Elephants enjoying the river adjacent to The Pinnawala Elephant Orphanage in Sri Lanka, where they spend ~4 hours per day." class="attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image" height="110" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2017/02/Elephants-at-PEO-140x110.jpg" style="display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;" width="140" /><p>Our paper, published in <em>BMC Zoology</em>, is a labor of love, and for me came 30 years after I accidentally stumbled into the world of elephants. I was a postdoctoral fellow in 1987 at the Uniformed Services University in Bethesda, MD studying testicular function in rat and sheep models when I got a call from the elephant curator at the National Zoo, who asked if I could measure hormones in elephants. He had a young female (a 13 year old named Shanthi) they wanted to breed, but didn’t know if she had reached puberty. Having dreamed of a possible career with wildlife, I jumped at the chance and said ‘YES’ immediately.</p>
<p>Little did I know that there was almost nothing known about the biology of elephants, including puberty, so I started from scratch to find a way to assess ovarian cycle function. Estrogens weren’t very informative, so I focused on progesterone to characterize luteal activity and found a sensitive immunoassay that produced good results. Turns out Shanthi was cycling and she was sent out for breeding. I monitored hormones during her pregnancy and postpartum lactation, and then got interested in the other elephants at the zoo. I published a few papers and before I knew it, I was being inundated by requests from other zoos to monitor hormones in their elephants too.</p>
<p>Little did I know this was going to be the start of a whole new career, and that I would become obsessed with a love for elephants. In 1991, I was hired by the zoo and quickly established the first wildlife endocrine service lab, which focused on elephants initially, but today has produced data on over 250 species (<a href="https://nationalzoo.si.edu/center-for-species-survival/wildlife-endocrinology">https://nationalzoo.si.edu/center-for-species-survival/wildlife-endocrinology</a>).</p>
<blockquote><p>Little did I know that there was almost nothing known about the biology of elephants</p></blockquote>
<p>As with so many things in life, the more you learn, the more interested you become. This certainly happened to me with elephants. I soon learned how important elephants are in the natural world. They are <u>keystone</u> species because of how they modify habitat, converting forests to grassland, creating water holes in times of drought, and spreading the seeds of plants. They also are <u>umbrella</u> species, as the conservation of elephants preserves not only habitat, but other species therein.</p>
<p>As a zoo biologist, I became acutely aware of how important elephants are as a <u>flagship</u> species, raising awareness for action and funding of broader conservation efforts. Asian elephants are endangered, with only 35,000 – 50,000 remaining in the wild, and populations are being decimated by habitat destruction and poaching. There are almost no wild elephants left in several range countries, like Bangladesh, Bhutan, Cambodia, China, Nepal and Vietnam (&lt;500 each). For this reason, captive breeding is increasingly viewed as an important means of maintaining insurance populations in case of environmental or anthropromorphic catastrophe.</p>
<p>The problem is that not many captive populations are self-sustaining, here or abroad, and supplementation by wild capture has been widespread, putting further pressures on already fragile wild populations. So, at least in the U.S., I felt I could help by at least making sure we could identify all reproductively viable females (via blood hormone monitoring) for breeding. Teased by the zoo community for a while as being part vampire because of my insistence that all elephants be bled weekly to assess ovarian cyclicity, today it is standard practice.</p>
<figure class="wp-caption alignleft" id="attachment_8500" style="width: 650px;"><img alt="Janine with her study species." class="wp-image-8500 size-large" height="480" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2017/02/JanineElephantMyanmar-1024x768.jpeg" width="640" /><div class="attachment-image--caption">Janine with her study species.</div><div class="attachment-image--source"></div></figure>
<p>There are about 16,000 captive elephants in Asia, where they are used in tourism, religious activities and logging. In the mid 2000’s, I began working in Asia, where they face similar problems with elephant population management. I first visited The Pinnawala Elephant Orphanage (PEO) in Sri Lanka in 2003, and have returned every few years after that. The PEO has one of the few sustainable populations in Southeast Asia. It began as an orphanage in 1975 with five baby elephants, and today has over 80, including 45 that were born there and span three generations. It is an amazing place, with elephants managed in semi-captive conditions. They do not have individual mahouts (keepers), which is common in most Asian tourist facilities. However, this means they are a bit wild, and certainly not used to being handled or blood sampled.</p>
<blockquote><p>[I was] teased by the zoo community for a while as being part vampire</p></blockquote>
<p>It was in 2007 that I met Dr. Samanthi Mendis, who was the vet at the PEO. It was clear she loved the elephants as if they were family; she knew each one by name, who liked whom, and who were the best mothers and aunties (allomothers). Elephants are a highly social species, and form close social bonds with each other. Samanthi said she was interested in doing a Master’s project and asked if would I be willing to mentor her with a Senior Academic (our co-author, Niromi Jayasekera) at the Perideniya University in Kandy. She wanted to know when the young elephants at PEO started to cycle, and because there were no papers published on the endocrinology of puberty in elephants, I knew this was would be a unique opportunity to amass new information on an understudied species.</p>
<figure class="wp-caption alignleft" id="attachment_8497" style="width: 650px;"><img alt="Dr Samanthi Mendis at the PEO" class="wp-image-8497 size-large" height="480" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2017/02/SamanthiMendis2-1024x768.jpg" width="640" /><div class="attachment-image--caption">Dr Samanthi Mendis at the PEO</div><div class="attachment-image--source"></div></figure>
<p>She picked out 11 females less than 15 years of age for her study and set about training them to obtain measures of body weight, height and length, and blood samples from the ear veins. In a region where positive reinforcement training was rarely, if ever, used, she recognized the need to treat the elephants humanely and found they readily performed desired behaviors in exchange for favored treats, such as bananas and sugar cane.</p>
<p>When all of the samples were collected, I brought my Mobile Endocrine Laboratory to Sri Lanka to analyze them (it was not possible to export the samples because of USDA concerns over diseases, like foot and mouth). At the same time, Samanthi received training in endocrine techniques as part of our commitment to building capacity in range countries.</p>
<p>The results of this study showed that these elephant females initiated ovarian cyclicity earlier than expected, compared to observational data on wild elephants. We just assumed elephants reached puberty around 12 years of age, but this study found many were cycling as young as 4.5 years. We believe this may be related to higher levels of nutrition in captivity compared to diets in the wild, and may be analogous to early puberty associated with increased body fat in modern girls.</p>
<p>Knowing when an elephant reaches puberty is important for preventing unwanted pregnancies in very young females, and can help guide breeding management decisions to maximize overall reproductive success. It has resulted in many zoos starting to collect blood samples from elephants at younger ages (starting at 5 instead of 8 years of age), and making sure young females are not left with bulls unsupervised.</p>
<p>What makes me so proud is that this study has not only resulted in important, new information, but that it fulfilled the dream of a young veterinarian to learn more about the elephants she cared so much about, and contributed to the scientific literature in a way that has changed how elephants are managed today. Our mission at the <a href="https://nationalzoo.si.edu/conservation/about-scbi">National Zoo and Smithsonian Conservation Biology Institute</a> is to save wildlife species from extinction and train future generations of conservationists. This study certainly met that mandate.</p>

            <p><em><img alt="Migration to Europe" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-18424" height="300" src="https://researchdigest.files.wordpress.com/2017/02/thinkstockphotos-488564236.jpg?w=300&amp;h=300" width="300" />By</em> <a href="http://www.psychologywriter.org.uk/">Christian Jarrett</a></p>
<p>Some would say that the political events currently convulsing the globe have been driven, at least in part, by widespread prejudice towards immigrants. To begin healing divisions, it would help if we understood more about how such prejudices can be passed from one generation to the next, so that we might intervene to stop this happening. To that end, a <a href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/bjop.12236/abstract?campaign=wolearlyview">new study</a> in the <em>British Journal of Psychology</em> has tracked the immigrant attitudes of over 500 Swedish teenagers over a six year period, to see how their attitudes changed over time, and if and how they might be related to the prejudices held by their parents and friends.</p>
<p><span id="more-18285"></span></p>
<p>Marta Miklikowska first surveyed the immigrant attitudes, friendships and empathy levels of the teenagers in 2010 when their average age was 13, and then measured their attitudes toward immigrants again in 2012 and 2014. At the start of the study only, she also surveyed the immigrant attitudes of the teenagers’ parents and peers. The survey included items like, “Immigrants often come here just to take advantage of welfare in Sweden” and participants rated how strongly they agreed or disagreed.</p>
<p>Overall, Miklikowska found that the teenagers’ prejudice towards immigrants increased in early adolescence, and then reduced in mid adolescence. The results suggested that parental prejudice may have a particularly lasting influence: teens with more prejudiced parents were more likely to display increasing negative attitudes toward immigrants through the study. In contrast, having more prejudiced peers was only associated with increasing prejudice in early adolescence, suggesting that the influence of peers diminishes over time. Note thought that this might be because the teen participants’ peer group had changed by the later stages of the study (remember peer prejudice was only surveyed at the beginning).</p>
<p>In the earlier surveys, those teenagers who had prejudiced parents but who also had their own immigrant friends did not show increases in their prejudice over time. This suggests having immigrant friends had a protective effect, but only in early adolescence, again perhaps because these friendships changed later in the study. Intriguingly, whether or not teenagers had immigrant friends at the beginning of the study did not appear to be related to the levels of their parents’ prejudice.</p>
<p>Looking at <em>how</em> parents and peers prejudices might shape teenagers’ own attitudes, the study suggested that empathy might be a key mechanism. Teenagers with more prejudiced parents and/or peers tended to report lower levels of empathic concern for other people in general (though there was no association with their levels of non-emotional perspective taking). Miklikowska suggested that “prejudiced parents and peers might constitute empathy-impeding environments”, which could contribute towards the formation of negative immigrant attitudes in teenagers.</p>
<p>Socioeconomic background and parental education were also relevant. Teenagers from poorer backgrounds and with less educated parents tended to report greater prejudice towards immigrants.</p>
<p>All the above discussion, especially talk of parents and peers <em>shaping</em> teenagers’ own attitudes, comes with a huge caveat. Although the longitudinal aspect of the research is a strength, the methodology was purely observational, so the apparent associations between teenagers’ attitudes and those of their parents and peers might not be causal. Interpreting social research of this kind is also complicated by inevitable genetic influences at play. If a teenager of prejudiced parents displays increasing prejudice of his or her own, it’s possible, perhaps likely, that this is at least in part because they share the same genetic dispositions toward empathy and prejudice as their parents.</p>
<p>Despite these caveats, there is a dearth of longitudinal research into the formation of prejudiced attitudes in teenagers, so Miklikowska’s study therefore makes an important contribution. Indeed, she believes her findings could help inform anti-prejudice programmes. “The fact that intergroup friendships [i.e. having friends who are immigrants] are independent of parent prejudice while they buffer against its effects encourages the use of intergroup contact in programmes targeting youth with prejudiced parents,” she said. The tendency for teens with more prejudiced parents and peers to show lower empathy levels also suggests another possible avenue for intervention – perhaps fostering greater empathy skills could buffer teens against the influence of any prejudices swirling around their social circle.</p>

Office workers are at particular risk. In the UK, around half of the workforce is office-based, and spends much of the working day seated at a desk. We<a href="http://bmcpublichealth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12889-014-1338-1"> previously</a> showed that, on average, London office workers sit for 10.5hr each weekday, with little standing or movement observed during core working hours.</p>
<blockquote><p>On average, London office workers sit for 10.5hr each weekday.</p></blockquote>
<p>In response to these concerns, in June 2015 a public health guidance statement was <a href="http://bjsm.bmj.com/content/49/21/1357">published</a> that recommended office workers should aim to stand or do light activity (e.g. walk) for 2-4hrs per workday. The authors – seven UK academics and the director of a national sitting-reduction campaign – suggested this target could be achieved by, for example, using height-adjustable ‘sit-stand’ desks, or taking regular breaks to stand and move around.</p>
<p>As the first guidance to offer specific recommendations for standing and sitting time, the statement was reported by several major media outlets in the UK and further afield. Five UK newspaper websites reported on the statement, and allowed readers to publicly post comments on the story, for example: the <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3106596/Office-workers-stand-two-hours-day-Doctors-say-constant-sitting-leading-health-issues-including-obesity-cancer-Type-2-diabetes.html">Daily Mail</a> and the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2015/jun/01/office-workers-on-feet-standing-fours-hours-day-study-health">Guardian</a>.</p>
<h3><strong>The study</strong></h3>
<p>Our <a href="https://bmcpublichealth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12889-016-3974-0">new paper</a>, published today in <em><a href="https://bmcpublichealth.biomedcentral.com/">BMC Public Health</a></em>, examines public responses to media coverage of the 2015 workplace sitting guidance statement, via an analysis of all available comments posted on newspaper websites. We wanted to explore these comments because public acceptability can be vital to the success of public health interventions; strategies that are unacceptable to the people that they target may be practically or politically feasible.</p>
<p>Each of the 573 comments we analyzed fitted into one of three categories. Those in the first category questioned the credibility of the workplace sitting guidance, querying whether the authors had the knowledge and experience to offer implementable guidance, or challenging the evidence base. Some commentators felt the guidance was impractical in their own workplace, because their managers prioritized productivity over employee health, and would penalize employees for taking breaks from their desk.</p>
<p>The second category questioned the credibility of public health more broadly. Public health stakeholders were commonly mistrusted, and portrayed as a group with clandestine motives that conflict with those of the ‘real’ public. Some commentators, for example, felt public health serves hidden financial interests (such as increasing sales of sit-stand desks).</p>
<blockquote><p>The third category showed commentators acting as ‘citizen scientists’, sharing their own knowledge and experiences relating to sitting and standing.</p></blockquote>
<p>The third category showed commentators acting as ‘citizen scientists’, sharing their own knowledge and experiences relating to sitting and standing, and how to adhere to the guidance. Some shared advice on how to build inexpensive makeshift standing workstations, or integrate more movement into seated work routines.</p>
<p>The comments we analyzed may not represent the views of the general public; they capture the views of website readers that were sufficiently affected by a media report of the guidance to publicly respond to it. Nonetheless, they provide a glimpse into some of the possible reactions that may face public health stakeholders who attempt to implement sitting-reduction initiatives in the workplace.</p>
<p>Our new paper is part of a program of research that we are undertaking, with UK Medical Research Council funding (MR/N008979/1), to investigate aspects of the workplace context, and how they may shape how people respond to sitting-reduction methods. For example, previous studies (<a href="https://bmcpublichealth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12889-016-3611-y">1</a>,<a href="http://bmcpublichealth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12889-015-2635-z">2</a>,<a href="https://bmcpublichealth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12889-016-3023-z">3</a>) suggest office workers find the idea of standing in meetings to be acceptable in principle. We are currently writing up the first study, to our knowledge, to document the experiences of employees who have tried standing in meetings where all other attendees are seated. Findings point to standers’ perceptions of social processes – e.g., power dynamics, violation of social norms, public self-awareness – in shaping their experiences. We are also co-designing, with desk-based office employees, content for a new sitting reduction intervention that speaks to employees’ priorities.</p>
<p>Our new paper, and our upcoming work, reveals the real-world social contexts in which workplace sitting interventions would be implemented, and within which the public acceptability of such interventions is negotiated. We think it is essential that researchers, practitioners, and employers interested in reducing office workers’ sitting time acknowledge these contexts. There has been considerable work to understand which strategies may be most promising for reducing office employees’ sitting time (<a href="http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/17437199.2015.1082146">1</a>,<a href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD010912.pub3/abstract">2</a>). Our new work broadens this discussion to consider which strategies may work for whom, how, and in what contexts.</p>

</strong>While studies on wild Asian elephants show that females give birth at 12-18 years of age, there are examples of zoo elephants giving birth at only 5-6 years old. Little work has been carried out to determine the age at which young elephants reach puberty. This study in <em>BMC Zoology</em> measures hormone levels in elephants ranging in age from 3.5 years to 15 years to document initiation of ovarian cyclicity. It was identified that elephants in human care may reach puberty earlier than their wild counterparts, and perhaps this is due to a better nutrition and reaching a suitable bodyweight at a younger age.</p>

</strong>Lobopodians are a group of Palaeozoic animals with soft legs, from which the Panarthropoda groups evolved. This group likely illustrates the importance of niche diversification on morphological diversity, however their ecology is poorly characterised. A study in <em>BMC Evolutionary Biology</em> describes a new species found in Canada whose morphology and suspension-feeding ecology is convergent with some modern marine animals. A Bayesian approach to biological classification supports the view that the sort this semi-sessile, suspension-feeding lifestyle of this taxon characterised the origin of Panarthtopoda.

</strong>Associative learning results from the pairing of unrelated stimuli while non-associative learning occurs in response to single stimuli. This study by Schausberger and Peneder determines how these learning processes contribute to learning tasks and overall behaviour in the predatory skills of foraging mites. In numerous scenarios where the foraging mites are predisposed to the prey in different associative and non-associate learning environments, it is shown that both learning forms operate in predatory mites and both result in persistant memory, with the argument that non-associative learning is an inevitable component of the associate learning counterpart.</p>

</strong>Vast diversification of <em>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</em> occurs in the lungs of cystic fibrosis patients during infection. This study in <em>BMC Microbiology</em> looks at identifying selective drivers behind this evolutionary process. Bacterial populations were experimentally evolved with or without a community of bacteriophages. Analysis of the final populations revealed large phenotypic diversity but no difference in relation to the presence or absence of phages. Most commonly, a loss of motility and gain of resistance to the phages was observed. Some evolved populations even demonstrated antibiotic resistance. The concluding populations are similar to those observed amongst clinical isolates from cystic fibrosis infections, indicating a useful model for this infection.</p>

</strong>Appropriate terminology in nutrition education programs and behaviour change campaigns is important in optimising the effectiveness of these efforts. An online survey was carried out by Pettigrew et al. to assess the perceptions of adults to the meaning of four terms  used to describe unhealthy foods. Within the results,  ‘Junk food’ was the term most clearly associated with unhealthiness, while ‘Snack food’ was thought to represent both healthy and unhealthy food. This study shows that a detailed understanding of these meanings is pivotal to ensuring nutrition guidance and health campaigns use appropriate terminology.</p>
<p><strong>BMC Research Notes:  <a href="https://bmcresnotes.biomedcentral.com/">Renewing its focus<br />
</a></strong>Since it first launched in 2008, BMC Research Notes has been a place where researchers can publish short notes and observations, research outputs which are useful for the community but which can end up hidden in the lab notebook or as a footnote in a dataset. In order to re-affirm the importance of publishing these kinds of outputs, the journal is renewing its focus on publishing note articles as well as other potentially dark data such as short null results.</p>

          </div>
          <div class="panel-body">

            <img alt="Open-Science-blog-post-image" class="attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image" height="150" src="http://blogs.plos.org/plos/files/2017/02/Open-Science-blog-post-image-150x150.png" style="display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;" width="150" /><blockquote><p>“You look at science (or at least talk of it) as some sort of demoralizing invention of man, something apart from real life, and which must be cautiously guarded and kept separate from everyday existence. But science and everyday life cannot and should not be separated.” -Rosalind Franklin</p></blockquote>
<p>In this current political climate, facts matter more than ever. With responsibility as a leading Open Access publisher, a beacon of positive change to archaic systems, PLOS loudly stands up for science and scientists around the world in their efforts to improve the health and well-being of societies and explain the wonder of the world around and beyond us.</p>
<p>Back in the 17th and 18th centuries, enlightenment thinkers advanced politics, philosophy, science and communication; they supported <strong><a href="https://prezi.com/lhqmhzz452rb/enlightenments-influence-on-the-us-constitution/" target="_blank">equality and human dignity</a></strong>, and opposed superstition, intolerance and bigotry. Scientific thinking and the scientific method was a critical shaper of the enlightenment. As we look at the world around us, we must ask, what has the scientific method brought to our world, and to our world view? To answer this question, we must let the data speak for itself. Your data. My data. And the data of every geologist, atmospheric scientist, evolutionary biologist, geneticist, physicist, engineer, software developer and physician scientist. This is a position PLOS has exemplified through its <strong><a href="http://journals.plos.org/plosone/s/data-availability" target="_blank">Open Data policy</a></strong> and we strongly support the Office of Science and Technology Policy’s guidance, provided most recently in its <strong><a href="https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/blog/2017/01/06/strengthening-global-sharing-scientific-data-and-research-findings" target="_blank">January 6, 2017 memo</a></strong>, on this important area.</p>
<p><strong>Science in Action</strong></p>
<p>But how can this data speak when science communication is blocked from reaching the public and the scientists themselves are prevented from reaching their labs, their communities, their places of work? Access to information, access to research and data enables better policy decisions. In turn, policies informed by <strong><a href="http://www.ppehlab.org/datarefuge" target="_blank">publicly and privately funded data</a></strong> and created by enlightened governments, academic communities, patient advocacy groups and global coalitions all power improvements in our world. <strong><a href="http://collections.plos.org/eco-climate-change" target="_blank">Climate change</a></strong>, <strong><a href="http://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.1002198" target="_blank">vaccine safety</a></strong> and <strong><a href="http://collections.plos.org/elephant-welfare" target="_blank">animal welfare</a></strong> are among the many areas where we support the scientific endeavor to inform the debate with data-based evidence, and organizations like the <strong><a href="https://www.cdc.gov/norovirus/index.html" target="_blank">Center for Disease Control</a></strong> and the <strong><a href="http://collections.plos.org/ferg2015" target="_blank">World Health Organization</a></strong> rely on data-based evidence to foster human health both in the US and around the world.</p>
<p>It is impossible for PLOS to know how many of our global network of nearly 7,000 editors, more than 78,000 reviewers and authors from more than 190 countries are on any particular type of visa. We do know science is, and has been for generations, an international endeavor. Scientists collaborate and travel for post-doctoral fellowships, conferences, review panels, sabbaticals and speaking engagements. Conceptual understanding, testable hypothesis, well-designed studies, observational methods and sufficient replication are the tenets of science discussed during these meetings, as well as during routine days in the lab. These tenets of science are upheld by all researchers, regardless of nationality, religion, race, gender, sexual orientation, career stage or professional stature. Immigration restrictions inhibit that free exchange of knowledge.</p>
<p>As a nonprofit publisher, innovator and advocacy organization founded to accelerate progress in science communication, we must advocate for what we know to be true: <strong>PLOS must not only liberate science communication from the constraints of traditional publishing, we must stand up for science to ensure the liberation of scientific facts, intelligent discourse and conclusions based on data.</strong> Given that PLOS’ primary mission is the elimination of barriers to the open dissemination of scientific research, we’re naturally against policies and practices that increase, rather than decrease, obstacles.</p>
<p>In a world that abruptly and forcefully presents challenges of accessibility, accountability and discovery, a rigorous commitment to <strong><a href="https://www.plos.org/core-principles" target="_blank">our core principles</a></strong> and mission to transform how research results are communicated is even more critical. A growing international community of readers, educators, policy makers, scientists and entrepreneurs share, reuse and remix Open Access research article content without restriction—advancing the innovation economy and the health of communities around the world.</p>
<p>We continue to support the scientific community from which we were founded and to be vocal in pushing the continued expansion of open science. <strong>We support, and will be represented at, the <a href="https://www.marchforscience.com/" target="_blank">March for Science</a> in Washington—now scheduled for Earth Day April 22nd!</strong> We look forward to seeing you there.</p>

 Zika virus (ZIKV) has recently emerged as an explosive pandemic associated with severe neuropathology in newborns and adults1. There are no ZIKV-specific treatments or preventatives; thus, development of a safe and effective vaccine is a high priority. Messenger RNA (mRNA) has emerged as a versatile and highly effective platform to deliver vaccine antigens and therapeutic proteins2,3. Here, we demonstrate that a single low-dose intradermal immunization with lipid nanoparticle-encapsulated nucleoside-modified mRNA (mRNA-LNP) encoding the pre-membrane and envelope (prM-E) glycoproteins of a 2013 ZIKV outbreak strain elicited potent and durable neutralizing antibody responses in mice and non-human primates. Immunization with 30 μg of nucleoside-modified ZIKV mRNA-LNPs protected mice from ZIKV challenges at 2 weeks or 5 months post-vaccination, and a single dose of 50 μg was sufficient to protect non-human primates from a challenge at 5 weeks post-vaccination. These data demonstrate that nucleoside-modified mRNA-LNPs elicit rapid and durable protective immunity and thus represent a new and promising vaccine candidate for the global fight against ZIKV.

related to my current research: using polygon meshes as a way to represent
neuronal morphologies. I will revisit the previous presentation as a way to
provide the required background, touching briefly on the acquisition of
neuronal morphology data from microscopy and the generation of computer
representations using the SWC format.  The second part of the presentation will
focus on the advantages of 3D meshes and the internal code structure of the
processing pipeline in my project. Finally, I will discuss how I intend to
tease out a research question out of what is largely a software engineering
problem.</p>

            <p><a href="https://xcorr.net/2017/01/25/the-curious-case-of-wobblers/">In the last post</a>, we wrote about people with bilateral vestibular damage (BVD), who sometimes call themselves <em>wobblers</em>. Quick recap: as a rare side effect of taking antibiotics in the <a class="mw-redirect" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aminoglycosides" title="Aminoglycosides">aminoglycoside</a> family, some people suffer ototoxicity, and lose vestibular function bilaterally. The vestibule is an organ that tracks one’s position in space, not unlike a the gyros and accelerometers in smartphones. Having lost their sense of equilibrium, people with BVD have difficulty standing and walking without falling down.</p>
<p>Their equilibrium can be recovered in the short term with sensory substitution. A stimulation device on their tongue feeds information equivalent to the vestibule’s; when they tilt their head to the left, they get a jolt on the left of their tongue; when they tilt forward, they get a jolt on the front of the tongue, and so on. After continuous usage over a period of months, neural plasticity kicks in, increasing the gain of other sensory modalities and recalibrating the residual signal in the damaged inner ear. As a consequence, they partially recover their sense of equilibrium even when not using the device.</p>
<p>Dr. Marissé Masis-Solano and I set about make a more practical version of this system, using off-the-shelf open electronics. This was our first large project with open-source electronics, and we learned a lot about how important it is to iterate quickly to find the design pain points. Here’s how we made our prototype.</p>
<p><span id="more-5916"></span></p>
<h2>The premise</h2>
<p>Our basic idea was to attach a measurement device to a person’s head to measure its tilt; to relay that information via RF to another device on the person’s body; and to actuate haptics using a receiver device so the tilt could be felt through another sense.</p>
<h2>The glove</h2>
<p>We decided to build a glove to house haptics. The haptics information would be relayed via vibration motors. ERM motors — eccentric rotating mass motors — are DC motors with an eccentric mass, which makes them vibrate when applying a DC current; it’s the same kind of device that makes your smartphone vibrate.</p>
<figure class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_6229" style="width: 310px;"><img />ERM motor components, from Precision MicroDrives</figure>
<p>I assembled 4 ERM motors into an array with some solder, shrink-wrap and a bit of hot glue. Marissé then sewed into a glove via a reinforced flap. Fun fact: Marissé is a talented eye surgeon, and as a consequence, she can sew, but she can only sew with curved needles; thankfully, there were a few of those lying around at <a href="https://noisebridge.net/">NoiseBridge</a>.</p>

<h2>The headpiece</h2>
<p>Next, we scoped out the headpiece. We had originally intended to use a simple analog accelerometer to measure the vector of gravity, but in our initial tests it was tricky to reliably calibrate, and didn’t provide the resolution we needed for our experiments.</p>
<p><img /></p>
<p>We decided to upgrade to a <a href="https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-bno055-absolute-orientation-sensor/overview">BNO055 9-DOF</a>, a board which integrates an accelerometer, a gyro, as well as a compass to measure the 9 different vector components of absolute spatial orientation. An IC on the board does Kalman filtering to reliably output absolute orientation, and has its own on-board calibration routines, as well as means of loading previous calibrations.</p>
<div class="jetpack-video-wrapper"></div>
<p>At 30$, it’s one of the most expensive components in the whole design. That being said, a comparable device could easily have run into the thousands of dollars only a few years ago — smartphones have made 9-DOFs big business, and prices have fallen steadily.</p>
<p>The cheap accelerometers still have their uses, however; we used one to take some measurements of the impulse response function of the coin ERMs when applying a DC current.</p>
<figure class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_6255" style="width: 310px;"><img />Standalone Nordic RF boards</figure>
<p>We originally experimented with sending the signal from the headpiece of the receiver via standalone Nordic radio boards. However, we found that the combined size of a radio, a 9-dof plus the microcontroller was a little unwieldy. Therefore, we switched over to a microcontroller with integrated RF capabilities.</p>
<p>I bought a couple of Adafruit’s Bluefruit LE Arduino-compatible boards, but quickly found out that they weren’t appropriate for our project, as they don’t support peer-to-peer communication. So I ordered a couple of <a href="https://www.adafruit.com/products/3076">32u4 with RFM69 radios</a>, which have the exact same form factor as the Bluefruit, but instead communicate via an ad-hoc RF protocol.</p>
<p>A big advantage of this line of microcontrollers is that they are directly compatible with LiON battery packs, which can be found in a large range of form factors.</p>
<figure class="wp-caption alignnone" id="attachment_6258" style="width: 4000px;"><img />The microcontroller, with soldered 9-dof, and its LiON battery </figure>
<p>A bit of soldering later, we had our prototype headpiece. Originally, we had planned to keep it simple, and put the assembly inside of giant earmuffs, the kind that construction workers use to drill asphalt without suffering hearing loss. However, at that point, the whole assembly was so small that it seemed feasible to attach it directly to an ear.</p>
<p>We 3D printed a couple of different ear hooks we found on thingiverse, but nothing was very satisfactory.</p>
<figure class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_6261" style="width: 200px;"><img />This hook looked cool, but it was unstable</figure>
<p>Then we struck gold at NoiseBridge: in the random discarded electronics bin, we found an old Bluetooth headset! We gutted the old electronics, and our assembly fit perfectly within the shell of the old headset.</p>
<figure class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_6264" style="width: 310px;"><img />The gutted headset</figure>
<figure class="wp-caption alignnone" id="attachment_6266" style="width: 2448px;"><img />The headset assembly worn by a handsome man </figure>
<h2>Initial tests and adjustments</h2>
<p>We started out with a second 32u4 Arduino device as the sole component of the receiver, directly controlling the ERM vibration motors. The headpiece would continuously transmit its position in space, and the receiver would transduce that information to vibration on the palm. You would tilt your head to the right, and the ERM motor in the right part of the glove would vibrate.</p>
<p><img /></p>
<p>Several things became immediately apparent:</p>
<ul>
<li>Calibrating the headpiece was clunky; you needed to plug in the headpiece to a computer via USB and enter a series of commands in the Arduino serial monitor to set the zero point of the accelerometer.</li>
<li>Understanding the status of the receiver — whether it was receiving RF input or not, and whether that input was calibrated or not — was difficult because it didn’t have any way of showing its status beyond flashing a single red LED.</li>
<li>You couldn’t really feel the vibration of the ERM motors within the glove.</li>
</ul>
<p>We went back to the drawing board and made a series of modifications to solve each of these three problems.</p>
<p>First, we worked on the calibration. We originally used 4-point calibration — the user was instructed to tilt their head forward, backward, left, right and then the headpiece would send calibrated information to the receiver. We got that down to two-point calibration: a simpler sequence in which the user was instructed to keep their head at a neutral position, and then move forward.</p>
<p>The was enough to measure the location of the gravity vector in the neutral position, as well as an orthogonal vector corresponding to the forward direction; their cross-product gave the third axis, corresponding to tilt towards the right. Arduinos have very little memory, so I had to come up with a means of measuring the variance of the measurements online to make sure that the calibrations were accurate. I used <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithms_for_calculating_variance#Online_algorithm">Welford’s algorithm</a> to measure the variance of the 9-dof measurements online in each of the two calibration positions, rejecting calibrations that were too noisy.</p>
<p>This calibration procedure still required the user to plug the headpiece into the USB, so I made some modifications to allow the calibration sequence to be started from the receiver. I added a capacitive touch board to add a few flexible buttons to the glove, and an RGB LED to tell the user the status of the device: green for calibrated, red for uncalibrated, or blue for mid-calibration.</p>
<p>Because the calibration was now triggered from the receiver, I had to set up bidirectional communication between the receiver and the headpiece. The Arduino IDE is not well-adapted to this kind of multiple device project, so I upgraded to <a href="http://platformio.org/">PlatformIO</a>. See <a href="https://xcorr.net/2016/12/13/multi-arduino-projects-with-platformio/">my previous post on PlatformIO</a> on how to set up a multi-Arduino project.</p>
<p>To get better haptic feedback from the glove, I decided to use a booster circuit. The 32u4 uses 3.3 volt logic, while the coin ERM motors support up to 5V; I figured that by increasing the voltage, it should be possible to get a stronger vibration, which would be easier to feel. I re-used the same logic transistor logic that I has used previously in the <a href="https://xcorr.net/2016/08/28/flicker-fusion-threshold-circuit-with-arduino/">flicker fusion project</a> to boost the ERM devices up to 4.2V.</p>
<figure class="wp-caption alignnone" id="attachment_6273" style="width: 4032px;"><img />The completed prototype</figure>
<p>The whole thing, with three stacked boards, was a little fragile, and it was easy to accidentally touch the GPIO pins; I placed the whole thing in transparent shrink tube, and after applying heat, got a nice, solid build. <a href="https://github.com/patrickmineault/haptic-duino">Here’s the code to make it all work</a>.</p>
<h2>Prototype</h2>
<p>So how does it work? The headpiece is comfortable and accurately transmits tilt information after a straightforward calibration procedure; RF communication is seamless, and there’s scarcely any sync issues; LED feedback from the receiver is easy to understand.</p>
<p>However, we found that, even after boosting the ERM motor drive, we couldn’t properly perceive the location of the vibration within the glove. Was it that the palm was not sensitive enough to vibration? Did we use the wrong stimulation sequence? We tried, haphazardly, to fix the problem using <a href="http://www.eagleman.com/research/sensory-substitution">different stimulation protocols</a>, adjusting the strength of the stimulation, and so forth, but we got stuck for a while.</p>
<p>Part of the reason we got stuck is that we had a lot of opinions — <em>do you think this works better than the last version?</em> — but not a lot of data — <em>is this quantitatively better than the last version?</em>. The answer was right under our nose — psychophysics! We needed to measure how different stimulation parameters influenced our perception, and optimize them until we got something that worked.</p>
<p>In the next post, I’ll show how we used psychophysics to pinpoint exactly how we could tweak our design to make it work. Follow me on <a href="https://twitter.com/patrickmineault">Twitter</a> or <a href="https://www.facebook.com/xcorr-computational-neuroscience-290007894348201/?ref=aymt_homepage_panel">Facebook</a> to get notified of next week’s installment.</p><br />  <a href="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gocomments/xcorr.wordpress.com/5916/" rel="nofollow"><img alt="" border="0" src="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/comments/xcorr.wordpress.com/5916/" /></a> <img alt="" border="0" height="1" src="https://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=xcorr.net&amp;blog=3084329&amp;post=5916&amp;subd=xcorr&amp;ref=&amp;feed=1" width="1" />

            <img alt="Great hammerhead shark (Albert kok, Wikimedia commons, CC)" class="attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image" height="110" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2017/01/Great_hammerhead2-140x110.jpg" style="display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;" width="140" /><p> </p>
<p>A new study by Dr. Nickolas Marra and colleagues on the transcriptomic analysis of elasmobranches (a subclass of cartilaginous fish such as sharks) and teleosts (a class of bony, ray-finned fishes) has revealed fascinating new information on evolutionary immunology and its impact on cancer development.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The researchers focus for this study was on seven particular species of fishes: four species of elasmobranchs (the white shark, shortfin mako, great hammerhead, and yellow stingray) and three species of teleosts (the swordfish, hogfish, and ocean surgeonfish), all of whom were not arbitrarily chosen. While the genomes of these organisms have not yet been extensively studied, they comprise a category of the oldest known vertebrates with a primitive adaptive immune system, efficient wound healing, and the development of regional endothermy in several species. This primitive immune system shares the same B and T cell genes which comprise the basis of our own adaptive immune system, and offers a glimpse into how this system has developed in a challenging environment.</p>
<p> </p>
<figure class="wp-caption alignright" id="attachment_8480" style="width: 310px;"><img alt="Yellow_stingray_grand_cayman" class="wp-image-8480 size-medium" height="169" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2017/01/Yellow_stingray_grand_cayman-300x169.jpg" width="300" /><div class="attachment-image--caption">Yellow stingray (Tom4Surfing, Wikimedia commons, CC)</div><div class="attachment-image--source"></div></figure>
<p>The seven species that were studied are also known for having a low propensity for developing cancer (elasmobranchs are suspected to have the lowest incidence of malignant neoplasia of any vertebrate group) and illness associated with infection (based on several case studies), despite being known as the “garbage cans of the sea,” eating carcinogenic material and having flesh wounds exposed to bacteria filled ocean water. In theory this environment should increase their odds for developing tumors, but the opposite has shown to be true. The reason for this low disease rate has never been clearly understood, so Marra and colleagues set out to compare the genomes between these ancient living fish and try to determine a genomic basis.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Three major differences in the immune systems between elasmobranches, teleosts and higher order vertebrates are:</p>
<ol>
<li>A lack of bone marrow in elasmobranches (where B cells normally develop)</li>
<li>The presence of a newly discovered form of immunoglobulin (IgNAR) which lacks light chain structures</li>
<li>Major differences in the genomic organization of immunology genes</li>
</ol>
<p> </p>
<p>Another adaptive change that is present in ancient fish concerns their cardiovascular system, and the evolutionary development of a system designed to preserve regional endothermy in an icy ocean. This was the underlying reason the researchers chose to use tissue from the heart muscle for comparison; so they could use the heart transcriptome to examine a large repertoire of genes for possible evidence of convergent evolution between each of the fish species.</p>
<p> </p>
<figure class="wp-caption alignleft" id="attachment_8481" style="width: 310px;"><img alt="Great white shark (Elias Levy, Flickr, CC)" class="size-medium wp-image-8481" height="225" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2017/01/Great-white-shark-Elias-Levy-Flickr-CC-300x225.jpg" width="300" /><div class="attachment-image--caption">Great white shark (Elias Levy, Flickr, CC)</div><div class="attachment-image--source"></div></figure>
<p>On a genomic level, the researchers more specific goals were exploring differences in expressed gene content between elasmobranchs and teleosts, finding differences between specific species in regards to particular phenomena of interest such as adaptive immunity and wound healing, and finally identify genes with a history of molecular adaptation.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Once heart tissue was collected, sequencing libraries were constructed and compared via paired-end sequencing.  The sequencing was pooled with four species each, and then separated per species to create a species-specific heart transcriptome. The genes were run through BLAST and the results were analyzed and compared though genomic databases to compare and cluster.</p>
<p> </p>
<figure class="wp-caption alignright" id="attachment_8482" style="width: 310px;"><img alt="Figure 2 From Marra et al, CC The authors. Venn diagram of the MCLBlastLINE sequence clusters shared between teleosts and elasmobranchs (intersection of the diagram) as well as those unique to each of the groups" class="size-medium wp-image-8482" height="226" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2017/01/Fig-2-shark-genes-blog-300x226.jpg" width="300" /><div class="attachment-image--caption">Figure 2 from Marra et al. (The authors, CC)<br />Venn diagram of the MCLBlastLINE sequence clusters shared between teleosts and elasmobranchs (intersection of the diagram) as well as those unique to each of the groups</div><div class="attachment-image--source"></div></figure>
<p>Marra and colleagues discovered that while there is significant overlap, there are clear genetic differences between these species, particularly elasmobraches and teleosts. Furthermore, elasmobraches contain exclusive genes involved in immunity, metabolism and gene regulation within the heart genome, which make up a substantial proportion of the genes expressed in that tissue.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The researchers also revealed that while each of the species shared approximately 50% of their genomes in heart tissue, 50% were different. It is of particular note the immune genes in particular showed the most difference between classes of fish, both at the genomic and transcription levels.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>While the researchers did not find IgNAR using the Swiss-plot databases, they did find IgW (a cartilaginous fish version of the IgD found in mammals), and legumain (<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic">LGMN</em>), a gene related to antigen presentation in MHC class II molecules which has also been reported to be overexpressed in several cancers. It is suspected that IgNAR was not found due to it not being recognized by the database.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Legumain is also used as a target to eliminate tumor associated macrophages, and there are several studies reporting various shark extracts as having anti-tumorigenic properties. Overexpression of legumain occurs in tumor-associated macrophages and is thought to contribute to the tumor promoting inflammation associated with most malignancies.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Other genes of interest included oncogene <em>Bag1</em>, an athanogene which prevents cell apoptosis; <em>Tim22</em>, which regulates mitochondrial control; and a group of genes which regulate damaging cell peroxidases. It is suspected that <em>Bag1</em> has evolved within the shark genome to be better regulated via highly controlled expression levels so that the cell cycle can be closely monitored, unlike more advanced vertebrates where <em>Bag1</em> overexpression can cause cancer development. In regards to wound healing, there are several pathways which must act in tandem in order for this system to function properly, including inflammation and pathogen clearing. In particular, elasmobrach MHC class II molecules (used for immune cell signaling), have evolved to be more specific and tightly controlled then in higher level vertebrates. This MHC class II specialization is suspected to enhance wound repair.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The collection of highly regulatory genes found exclusively in ancient fish species showcases how little scientists know about the earliest vertebrates, and how much information can be translated into human cellular repair. While researchers have made substantial progress on understanding cancer pathways, they have not yet made leeway on methods to reverse cellular damage and initiate repair, making the genome of elasmobranches an invaluable resource in cancer treatment and information.</p>

<p><em>By</em> <a href="http://www.alexfradera.net/">Alex Fradera</a></p>
<p>Since she got back from her year abroad, there’s been something different about Sam. Once an avid rule-follower, now she’s breaking them – and when you raise it she explains that these things, after all, are just a matter of perspective.</p>
<p>Can exposure to other countries breed a flexible relationship to the rules, even moral relativism? According to <a href="http://psycnet.apa.org/journals/psp/112/1/1/">new research</a> in the <em>Journal of Personality and Social Cognition</em>, it can.</p>
<p>Columbia University’s Jackson Lu led an international team to explore this question through a range of studies. They knew living abroad has been associated with positive outcomes such as reduced judgment of other groups and, in particular, <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2009/05/06/living-abroad-linked-with-enhanced-creativity/">cognitive flexibility, which supports creativity</a>. But Lu’s team theorised a possible downside: that this flexibility could extend to the domain of morality. Perhaps experiencing many moral codes can prompt us to question our own.</p>
<p><span id="more-18199"></span></p>
<p>The researchers asked over 600 participants about their travel habits before providing them with a task where there was a golden opportunity to cheat. Participants took a trivia quiz where a “computer glitch” meant that they had to press the spacebar straight after seeing each question to avoid the answer also flashing on-screen. The researchers were secretly recording the bar presses, and the resultant index of cheating was higher for participants who had reported visiting more countries in their lives. The effect remained after controlling for some of the obvious confounding variables like age, gender, education, socioeconomic status, and personality.</p>
<p>Is the effect due to visiting many countries, or just more time away from home? In the next study, 551 MBA students reported both the total time they’d spent abroad, and the number of countries visited, before taking the trivia quiz. It was the number of countries they’d visited – effectively, the number of different moral codes experienced – that correlated with more cheating; amount of time abroad didn’t seem to be relevant. The researchers also took account of the levels of corruption in each of the countries the participants had visited (as measured by Transparency International’s <a href="http://www.transparency.org/research/cpi/overview">Corruption Perception Index</a>): this showed it was past exposure to a greater variety of other cultures, not exposure to particularly corrupt cultures, that was associated with greater cheating on the quiz.</p>
<p>A further study showed that as well as cheating more, participants who wrote about a multi-country trip subsequently expressed more permissive opinions towards acts of moral rule-breaking like fare-dodging, whether committed by themselves or by others. The implication is that extensive travel doesn’t make you feel that you are above the law, but makes you question whether these laws apply to anyone at all.</p>
<p>All this suggests that the well-travelled participants had picked up a trace of moral relativism from their travels, through exposure to a variety of moral frameworks. International travel seems to enable people to break moral rules as much as mental ones. The effect sizes were fairly small within these studies, meaning that the real-life consequences for well-travelled individuals are unlikely to be drastic. But as international travel becomes ever more commonplace, including for students still forming their views about how the world works, the effects uncovered here could have an influence on our world.</p>

            <p>Peroxisomes function together with mitochondria in a number of essential biochemical pathways, from bile acid synthesis to fatty acid oxidation. Peroxisomes grow and divide from pre-existing organelles, but can also emerge de novo in the cell. The physiological regulation of de novo peroxisome biogenesis remains unclear, and it is thought that peroxisomes emerge from the endoplasmic reticulum in both mammalian and yeast cells. However, in contrast to the yeast system, a number of integral peroxisomal membrane proteins are imported into mitochondria in mammalian cells in the absence of peroxisomes, including Pex3, Pex12, Pex13, Pex14, Pex26, PMP34 and ALDP. Overall, the mitochondrial localization of peroxisomal membrane proteins in mammalian cells has largely been considered a mis-targeting artefact in which de novo biogenesis occurs exclusively from endoplasmic reticulum-targeted peroxins. Here, in following the generation of new peroxisomes within human patient fibroblasts lacking peroxisomes, we show that the essential import receptors Pex3 and Pex14 target mitochondria, where they are selectively released into vesicular pre-peroxisomal structures. Maturation of pre-peroxisomes containing Pex3 and Pex14 requires fusion with endoplasmic reticulum-derived vesicles carrying Pex16, thereby providing full import competence. These findings demonstrate the hybrid nature of newly born peroxisomes, expanding their functional links to mitochondria.</p><p>Nature   <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/nature21375">doi: 10.1038/nature21375</a></p><img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/NatureBiologicalSciencesResearch/~4/AjmCzPEmPOY" width="1" />

 The aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR) recognizes xenobiotics as well as natural compounds such as tryptophan metabolites, dietary components and microbiota-derived factors, and it is important for maintenance of homeostasis at mucosal surfaces. AHR activation induces cytochrome P4501 (CYP1) enzymes, which oxygenate AHR ligands, leading to their metabolic clearance and detoxification. Thus, CYP1 enzymes have an important feedback role that curtails the duration of AHR signalling, but it remains unclear whether they also regulate AHR ligand availability in vivo. Here we show that dysregulated expression of Cyp1a1 in mice depletes the reservoir of natural AHR ligands, generating a quasi AHR-deficient state. Constitutive expression of Cyp1a1 throughout the body or restricted specifically to intestinal epithelial cells resulted in loss of AHR-dependent type 3 innate lymphoid cells and T helper 17 cells and increased susceptibility to enteric infection. The deleterious effects of excessive AHR ligand degradation on intestinal immune functions could be counter-balanced by increasing the intake of AHR ligands in the diet. Thus, our data indicate that intestinal epithelial cells serve as gatekeepers for the supply of AHR ligands to the host and emphasize the importance of feedback control in modulating AHR pathway activation.

 The origin and expansion of biological diversity is regulated by both developmental trajectories and limits on available ecological niches. As lineages diversify, an early and often rapid phase of species and trait proliferation gives way to evolutionary slow-downs as new species pack into ever more densely occupied regions of ecological niche space. Small clades such as Darwin’s finches demonstrate that natural selection is the driving force of adaptive radiations, but how microevolutionary processes scale up to shape the expansion of phenotypic diversity over much longer evolutionary timescales is unclear. Here we address this problem on a global scale by analysing a crowdsourced dataset of three-dimensional scanned bill morphology from more than 2,000 species. We find that bill diversity expanded early in extant avian evolutionary history, before transitioning to a phase dominated by packing of morphological space. However, this early phenotypic diversification is decoupled from temporal variation in evolutionary rate: rates of bill evolution vary among lineages but are comparatively stable through time. We find that rare, but major, discontinuities in phenotype emerge from rapid increases in rate along single branches, sometimes leading to depauperate clades with unusual bill morphologies. Despite these jumps between groups, the major axes of within-group bill-shape evolution are remarkably consistent across birds. We reveal that macroevolutionary processes underlying global-scale adaptive radiations support Darwinian and Simpsonian ideas of microevolution within adaptive zones and accelerated evolution between distinct adaptive peaks.

            <p>Both humans and animals seek primary rewards in the environment, even when such rewards do not correspond to current physiological needs. An example of this is a dissociation between food-seeking behaviour and metabolic needs, a notoriously difficult-to-treat symptom of eating disorders. Feeding relies on distinct cell groups in the hypothalamus, the activity of which also changes in anticipation of feeding onset. The hypothalamus receives strong descending inputs from the lateral septum, which is connected, in turn, with cortical networks, but cognitive regulation of feeding-related behaviours is not yet understood. Cortical cognitive processing involves gamma oscillations, which support memory, attention, cognitive flexibility and sensory responses. These functions contribute crucially to feeding behaviour by unknown neural mechanisms. Here we show that coordinated gamma (30–90 Hz) oscillations in the lateral hypothalamus and upstream brain regions organize food-seeking behaviour in mice. Gamma-rhythmic input to the lateral hypothalamus from somatostatin-positive lateral septum cells evokes food approach without affecting food intake. Inhibitory inputs from the lateral septum enable separate signalling by lateral hypothalamus neurons according to their feeding-related activity, making them fire at distinct phases of the gamma oscillation. Upstream, medial prefrontal cortical projections provide gamma-rhythmic inputs to the lateral septum; these inputs are causally associated with improved performance in a food-rewarded learning task. Overall, our work identifies a top-down pathway that uses gamma synchronization to guide the activity of subcortical networks and to regulate feeding behaviour by dynamic reorganization of functional cell groups in the hypothalamus.</p><p>Nature   <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/nature21066">doi: 10.1038/nature21066</a></p><img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/NatureBiologicalSciencesResearch/~4/K1zg_ncRhjU" width="1" />

 Separase is a cysteine protease with a crucial role in the dissolution of cohesion among sister chromatids during chromosome segregation. In human tumours separase is overexpressed, making it a potential target for drug discovery. The protease activity of separase is strictly regulated by the inhibitor securin, which forms a tight complex with separase and may also stabilize this enzyme. Separases are large, 140–250-kilodalton enzymes, with an amino-terminal α-helical region and a carboxy-terminal caspase-like catalytic domain. Although crystal structures of the C-terminal two domains of separase and low-resolution electron microscopy reconstructions of the separase–securin complex have been reported, the atomic structures of full-length separase and especially the complex with securin are unknown. Here we report crystal structures at up to 2.6 Å resolution of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae separase–securin complex. The α-helical region of separase (also known as Esp1) contains four domains (I–IV), and a substrate-binding domain immediately precedes the catalytic domain and has tight associations with it. The separase–securin complex assumes a highly elongated structure. Residues 258–373 of securin (Pds1), named the separase interaction segment, are primarily in an extended conformation and traverse the entire length of separase, interacting with all of its domains. Most importantly, residues 258–269 of securin are located in the separase active site, illuminating the mechanism of inhibition. Biochemical studies confirm the structural observations and indicate that contacts outside the separase active site are crucial for stabilizing the complex, thereby defining an important function for the helical region of separase.

 Height is a highly heritable, classic polygenic trait with approximately 700 common associated variants identified through genome-wide association studies so far. Here, we report 83 height-associated coding variants with lower minor-allele frequencies (in the range of 0.1–4.8%) and effects of up to 2 centimetres per allele (such as those in IHH, STC2, AR and CRISPLD2), greater than ten times the average effect of common variants. In functional follow-up studies, rare height-increasing alleles of STC2 (giving an increase of 1–2 centimetres per allele) compromised proteolytic inhibition of PAPP-A and increased cleavage of IGFBP-4 in vitro, resulting in higher bioavailability of insulin-like growth factors. These 83 height-associated variants overlap genes that are mutated in monogenic growth disorders and highlight new biological candidates (such as ADAMTS3, IL11RA and NOX4) and pathways (such as proteoglycan and glycosaminoglycan synthesis) involved in growth. Our results demonstrate that sufficiently large sample sizes can uncover rare and low-frequency variants of moderate-to-large effect associated with polygenic human phenotypes, and that these variants implicate relevant genes and pathways.

 CD4+ T cells are central mediators of autoimmune pathology; however, defining their key effector functions in specific autoimmune diseases remains challenging. Pathogenic CD4+ T cells within affected tissues may be identified by expression of markers of recent activation. Here we use mass cytometry to analyse activated T cells in joint tissue from patients with rheumatoid arthritis, a chronic immune-mediated arthritis that affects up to 1% of the population. This approach revealed a markedly expanded population of PD-1hiCXCR5−CD4+ T cells in synovium of patients with rheumatoid arthritis. However, these cells are not exhausted, despite high PD-1 expression. Rather, using multidimensional cytometry, transcriptomics, and functional assays, we define a population of PD-1hiCXCR5− ‘peripheral helper’ T (TPH) cells that express factors enabling B-cell help, including IL-21, CXCL13, ICOS, and MAF. Like PD-1hiCXCR5+ T follicular helper cells, TPH cells induce plasma cell differentiation in vitro through IL-21 secretion and SLAMF5 interaction (refs 3, 4). However, global transcriptomics highlight differences between TPH cells and T follicular helper cells, including altered expression of BCL6 and BLIMP1 and unique expression of chemokine receptors that direct migration to inflamed sites, such as CCR2, CX3CR1, and CCR5, in TPH cells. TPH cells appear to be uniquely poised to promote B-cell responses and antibody production within pathologically inflamed non-lymphoid tissues.
