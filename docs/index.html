                <h4><a href="http://brainblogger.com/2017/06/28/best-and-worst-in-health-and-healthcare-may-2017/">Best and Worst in Health and Healthcare – May 2017</a></h4>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In May, next generation therapies took the spotlight: brain-computer interfaces, brain training, tDCS, DNA vaccines, probiotics… Yet, they weren’t all successful. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Here’s the best and worst news of May.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>The best</b></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>Brain–computer interface therapy for post-stroke motor rehabilitation</b></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Functional recovery from motor disabilities can be a major challenge following stroke. A <a href="http://stroke.ahajournals.org/content/early/2017/05/26/STROKEAHA.116.016304">new study</a> tested a new therapy for motor-related disabilities affecting the arm in hemiparetic stroke survivors. It consisted of an exoskeleton driven by a <a href="http://brainblogger.com/2016/03/24/brain-machine-interfaces-new-technology-in-the-making/">brain–computer interface</a> (BCI) that used neural activity from the unaffected brain hemisphere to control the movement of the affected hand. By using BCI control to associate imagined hand movements with the opening and closing of the affected hand, participants would train the uninjured parts of their brain to take over movements that were previously controlled by the injured areas of the brain. This BCI-based therapy was shown to be effective in improving motor performance. Another important aspect of this study was the fact that this method was designed and configured for home-based neurorehabilitation. Its efficacy therefore showed that BCI-driven neurorehabilitation can be effectively delivered in the home environment.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>A probiotic for IBS-associated depression</b></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) affects 11% of the world’s population and is commonly accompanied by psychiatric symptoms, namely depression and anxiety. The <a href="http://brainblogger.com/2015/08/18/the-brain-gut-axis-part-1-a-paradigm-shift-in-neuroscience/">gut microbiota</a> is increasingly acknowledged as a key player in IBS and, via the gut-brain axis, as a likely contributor to the development of the associated psychiatric disorders. Therefore, a <a href="http://www.gastrojournal.org/article/S0016-5085(17)35557-9/abstract">new study</a> aimed at evaluating the effects of a probiotic bacteria on anxiety and depression in patients with IBS. The probiotic <i>Bifidobacterium longum</i> NCC3001 (BL) was administered to 44 adults with IBS and anxiety and/or depression for 6 weeks. It was shown that patients who received the probiotic were more likely to have a reduction in depression scores (but not anxiety) and increased quality of life than patients in the placebo group. BL had no effect on IBS, indicating that the reduction in depression scores was not merely a consequence of a reduction in IBS symptoms. Through fMRI analysis, these effects were shown to be linked to changes in brain activation patterns reflecting an effect of the probiotic on the limbic system. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>Brain training for chronic TBI</b></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Brain training has shown beneficial effects in acute traumatic brain injury (TBI) therapy, but studies on its effects in chronic TBI are still lacking. Therefore, a <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5434192/">new study</a> aimed at determining how the injured brain responds to cognitive training months-to-years after injury. Subjects with chronic TBI received <a href="http://brainblogger.com/2017/01/25/boost-confidence-with-brain-training/">cognitive training</a> for 8 weeks. Cortical thickness and brain connectivity were assessed as indicators of brain plasticity before training, immediately after training, and 3 months after training.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Results showed that cortical thickness and brain connectivity were improved after strategy-based reasoning training, which focused on selective attention, abstract reasoning, and other cognitive strategies. Importantly, these improvements were evident even 3 months after training was completed, indicating a sustained effect.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>DNA vaccines for Alzheimer’s disease</b></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">DNA vaccines may be the next generation of vaccines. They are designed to induce the production of antigens through the action of genetically engineered DNA, thereby triggering a protective immunological response. Although they are not yet approved for human use, they have been showing interesting beneficial effects in pre-clinical research. A <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5405538/">new study</a> has tested a DNA A?42 trimer vaccine (targeting amyloid plaques) for its effect on experimental <a href="http://brainblogger.com/2017/05/08/hiv-medications-linked-to-increase-in-alzheimers-disease-protein/">Alzheimer’s disease</a>. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">It was shown that DNA A?42 immunization produced a high antibody response and that the antibodies generated after vaccination were able to detect amyloid plaques in the brain, suggesting a promising preventive effect for Alzheimer’s disease. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>Cannabinoids for age-related cognitive decline</b></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The activity of the endocannabinoid system declines during aging, with the expression of the CB1 cannabinoid receptor and the levels of the major endocannabinoid (2-AG) being reduced in the brain of older animals. In a letter published in <em><a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nm.4311">Nature Medicine</a></em>, new data shows that a prolonged exposure to low doses of the cannabinoid delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC, the main psychoactive substance in cannabis) can reverse the age-related <a href="http://brainblogger.com/2015/03/29/running-from-aging-fitness-and-brain-health/">cognitive decline</a> in mice, improving spatial memory, long-term memory and learning flexibility.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"> The effect was accompanied by an increase in synaptic density in the hippocampus and a restoration of hippocampal gene transcription to patterns similar to those of young animals. This indicates a potential beneficial effect of cannabinoids in treating age-related cognitive impairments.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>The worst</b></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>Sleep disturbances may increase the risk of dementia</b></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Sleep disturbances are known to contribute to an overall deterioration of health. An association between <a href="http://brainblogger.com/2015/12/16/can-a-sleepwalker-feel-pain/">sleep disorders</a> and the development of dementia has also been proposed. A <a href="http://jech.bmj.com/content/71/4/329.long">new study</a> aimed at determining if this association is indeed observable in population-based studies. A first phase of the study took place between 1984 and 1989, when data about the sleeping patterns of the participants was collected. The incidence of dementia in those participants was now assessed using data from health registries.

<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>Maternal stress and fetal development</b></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) and urocortin (UCN) are two proteins with important roles in both human stress regulation and pregnancy. Therefore, a <a href="http://tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/10253890.2017.1312336">new study</a> investigated the association between an acute stress response, social overload (as an indicator of chronic stress) and the levels of CRH and UCN in the amniotic fluid of healthy, second-trimester pregnant women. The analyzes revealed that an acute <a href="http://brainblogger.com/2015/06/24/9-personality-traits-putting-mothers-at-risk-of-postpartum-depression/">maternal stress</a> response was not associated with increased levels of the two peptides, but that maternal chronic social overload and amniotic CRH were positively correlated. Amniotic CRH was found to be able to influence fetal growth albeit in a non-linear way. This indicates that, although acute maternal stress may not be as influential, chronic maternal stress may affect the production of molecules, such as CRH, that can potentially influence fetal development. </span></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Transcranial direct-current stimulation (tDCS) has been suggested be able to enhance cognitive abilities when associated with cognitive training. This claim has been tested in a <a href="http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0956797617698139">new study</a> of 123 older adults, in whom the effects of 20 sessions of anodal tDCS over the left prefrontal cortex and simultaneous working memory training on cognitive performance was assessed. Results showed that <a href="http://brainblogger.com/2015/03/05/tcds-a-therapy-for-the-future/">tDCS</a> failed to improve the efficacy of cognitive training. A meta-analysis including younger and older individuals was also performed. It also indicated that tDCS is not effective at improving the effect of cognitive training in working memory and global cognition. It is possible that the inefficacy of tDCS may be due to an inadequacy of current tDCS protocols for enhancing the effects of cognitive training, indicating that those protocols may need to be optimized.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>The onset of cocaine addiction</b></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Cues associated with the consumption of <a href="http://brainblogger.com/2016/10/05/diabetes-drug-for-addiction-treatment/">cocaine</a> can lead to dopamine release in the striatum brain region. This response is believed to be associated with the the motivation to consume. The acquisition of drug-seeking behaviors is believed to be associated with conditioned dopamine responses in the ventral striatum. But as drug use continues and becomes a habit, the conditioned responses shift to the dorsal striatum, which may be associated with compulsive drug use and susceptibility to addiction. A <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5405406/">new study </a>used PET imaging and<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>personalized cocaine cues to assess the pattern of the dopamine response in in recreational cocaine users without a substance use disorder. The results showed that the exposure to cues associated with the opportunity to use the drug increased the dopamine response in the dorsal striatum in recreational cocaine users. This indicates that a susceptibility to addiction may be developing even though there are no psychiatric signs of a substance abuse disorder. </span></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Chronic neuroinflammation and oxidative stress are believed to play an important role in driving Huntington’s disease progression. <a href="http://brainblogger.com/2016/11/06/how-prenatal-lead-exposure-results-in-neurodevelopmental-disorders/">NRF2</a> is a transcription factor with a chief role in regulating cellular anti-inflammatory and antioxidant defense genes. A <a href="http://www.pnas.org/content/114/23/E4676.abstract">new study</a> has reveled that NRF2 activation was suppressed in neural stem cells of Huntington’s disease patients, suggesting that these cells may be abnormally susceptible to oxidative stress. On the bright side, it was shown that the pharmacological activation of NRF2 was able to decrease inflammatory responses in glial cells, the main cellular mediators of neuroinflammation, and in blood monocytes from Huntington’s disease patients. These findings also suggest that NRF2 may be an important therapeutic target in Huntington’s disease.</span></p>

<img alt="" class="attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image" height="110" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2017/06/Gomo-collage-2-140x110.jpg" style="display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;" width="140" /><p>In the boreal forest of Fennoscandia over 150,000 moose (<em>Alces alces</em>) are harvested annually. Gut piles left in the field by hunters provide a large pulse of energy into the ecosystem, a potentially important food source for a range of scavenging predators.</p>
<p>Increased populations of these predators can negatively affect threatened or important game species. As a response to this, restrictions on field dressing of moose are under consideration in parts of Norway.</p>
<p>In this study, we used camera-trap data from 50 gut piles during 1043 monitoring days. Our research show that many species utilize gut piles, highlighting the potential importance of gut piles as a food source in the boreal ecosystem. Corvids (such as crows and ravens), medium-sized mammals, and raptors (such as golden eagles) were important scavengers in our study area, with corvids and the red fox (<em>Vulpes vulpes</em>) the main scavengers.</p>
<figure class="wp-caption alignleft" id="attachment_9216" style="width: 682px;"><img alt="" class="size-full wp-image-9216" height="504" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2017/06/Gomo-fig-1.jpg" width="672" /><div class="attachment-image--caption">Red foxes might be attracted by corvid activity during daytime. Here with five magpies (<em>Pica pica</em>) and one hooded crow (<em>Corvus cornix</em>).</div><div class="attachment-image--source"></div></figure>
<p>Corvids arrived first at the gut piles and could benefit from access to gut pile parts with the highest energy content. Corvid presence decreased with gut pile age, and we suggest that rather than feeding on parts with low energy content, corvids search for new gut piles when the energy rich parts are consumed, .</p>
<p>Being quite abundant, corvids might limit mammal access to high energy content, as mammals in general arrive later at the gut piles. Hence, temporal and spatial variation in corvid density in the boreal ecosystem might affect the gut pile biomass available to mammals.</p>
<p>Mammals scavenged on all parts of the gut piles, resulting in close to total consumption of the gut piles. The probability of mammal presence decreased at high gut pile densities. We suggest that this is due to a saturation effect – mammals can’t keep up with the input of fresh gut piles.</p>
<p>During summer, surplus gut piles would probably be lost resources to mammals as gut piles would be consumed by insects, bacteria and fungi. Low temperatures prevent this during autumn, keeping surplus gut piles available for scavengers after the hunting season ends.</p>
<figure class="wp-caption alignleft" id="attachment_9214" style="width: 648px;"><img alt="" class="size-full wp-image-9214" height="385" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2017/06/Gormo-figure-2.gif" width="638" /><div class="attachment-image--caption">Temporal development of the availability of gut pile parts with high and low energy content. Years are pooled</div><div class="attachment-image--source">Gomo et al. 2017</div></figure>
<p>The hunting season ends in mid-November. Gut pile parts with low energy content accumulates during the hunting season, and are available in relatively high densities a month after the end of the hunting season.</p>
<p>We know little about how gut piles affect individual survival or population dynamics of scavenging species. However, many studies have shown positive effects from food subsidies on consumer species, and it is reasonable to assume that removing this large pulse of energy from the boreal forests of Fennoscandia would have a negative impact on some of the species scavenging on gut piles.</p>
<p>However, it is difficult to predict the long-term effect on the relative abundance of scavengers. Removing gut piles could potentially reduce less wanted species of corvids and red fox, but also impact less abundant species like raptors. Reducing the amount of gut piles in the landscape would on the other hand reduce the potential risk of lead poisoning from bullet fragments, an increasing concern in raptor conservation. However, to what extend this pulsed resource is important for the overall survival, reproduction and population dynamics of both scavenging and potential prey species needs further investigation.</p>

<p>Most of us remember kids at school who seemed a little different – less sociable, more introverted and fragile, perhaps – and that they often seemed to be the ones to get picked on or rejected. Maybe you remember because you were one of those kids and you know what is was like to not fit in. Personality psychologists who study these things have partly backed this up: they’ve found that children and teens who score low in the “Big Five” traits of emotional stability, conscientiousness and agreeableness (similar to friendliness) are more likely to be bullied.</p>
<p>But of course being different is relative, it depends a lot on the crowd you’re in. A new <a href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/per.2105/full">study</a> in the <em>European Journal of Personality</em> has looked into this, providing a more nuanced picture of how a teenager’s personality may place them at risk of being bullied. The results suggest that teenagers are more likely to be a victim of bullying if they have a personality that is unusual compared with what’s typical in their particular classroom. The researchers, led by Savannah Boele at Tilburg University, say their findings need to be extended and replicated, but they hope they could help teachers spot and support the kids in their class who are most likely to be bullied.</p>
<p><span id="more-25897"></span></p>
<p>The data come from over a thousand pupils from six secondary schools in The Netherlands. Just under half were boys and the average age of the sample was 13.5 years.  All the participants completed measures of their Big Five personality traits (extraversion, emotional instability, agreeableness, openness and conscientiousness) and their “Dark Triad” traits (psychopathy, narcissism, and Machiavellianism). The participants also stated who from their class had bullied them, if anyone, and who, if anyone, they had bullied. The kind of bullying – verbal or physical and so on, was not specified.</p>
<p>To measure classroom personality, the researchers identified the average rank order of the eight different personality traits across pupils for each class. For instance, the class might score highest on extraversion, on average, followed by agreeableness, then conscientiousness and so on. Each participant’s own personality profile, in terms of the rank order of their own traits, could then be compared with their class average.</p>
<p>The more different a participant’s personality profile was from their classroom’s average, the more likely they were to be named as victims of bullying by their peers (there was a trend for them to also be more likely to describe themselves as victims, but this didn’t reach statistical significance). The researchers said this result is in-line with “previous findings that youths who deviate from social norms are more likely to be rejected and perceived as low-status peers and hence at increased risk for being victimised by their peers”.</p>
<p>Boele’s team also looked at participants’ specific personality traits and how these related to the class average. Discrepancies here were mostly related to describing oneself as a bullying victim, rather than being named as a victim. Specifically, having higher or lower extraversion, agreeableness or openness to experience than the classroom average was correlated with describing oneself as a victim of bullying. So too was having higher than average emotional instability or Machiavellianism, and lower than average psychopathy. In terms of being named as a victim, having higher than average emotional instability was a correlate, as was having higher or lower Machiavellianism.</p>
<p>The findings are preliminary and there are some obvious gaps – actual acts of bullying were not recorded, but depended on participants’ own sense of victimisation or admissions of bullying others. This means, for example, that having a different level of extraversion than what’s typical for the class might be related to extra sensitivity towards potential slights, rather than to overt acts of bullying (given that scoring differently from the class average on extraversion, and some other traits, was related to self-identifying as a victim, but not being named as a victim). Another thing: how a teenager’s personality is perceived by their peers is also likely to be highly relevant but wasn’t measured in this study, which relied entirely on participants’ descriptions of their own personalities. Finally, remember the data are correlational, so it’s possible being bullied affects teens’ personalities, rather than, or as well as, their personalities affecting their risk of being bullied.</p>
<p>So more research needed, but this paper makes an important contribution to the literature, being the first study to provide evidence that having a personality that’s different from the classroom average can be a risk factor for being bullied.</p>

<img alt="" class="webfeedsFeaturedVisual wp-post-image" height="150" src="http://blogs.plos.org/neuro/files/2017/06/5499502593_84981c67d2_z-150x150.jpg" style="display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;" width="150" /><p><em>“Munch, munch, munch.”</em></p>
<p>For most of us, the sounds of our lunch date chewing or a coworker clicking their pen are everyday components of an auditory landscape that go largely unnoticed. But for others, these seemingly mundane sounds are painfully unpleasant to the point of eliciting uncontrollable irritation or rage. There is ongoing disagreement as to whether this <em>hatred of sound</em>, termed <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26508801" target="_blank">misophonia</a>, should be recognized as a legitimate psychiatric disorder, and many sufferers continue to shamefully hide their extreme emotional responses to common sounds. But a recent surge in interest in misophonia is encouraging many to acknowledge that they suffer from the condition, and some medical professionals to accept that this reaction to otherwise neutral auditory stimuli reflects a veritable disorder. A flurry of research, aimed to characterize its behavioral manifestations and outline diagnostic criteria, has appeared over the past decade, though few studies have sought to determine the neural underpinnings of misophonia.</p>
<p><strong>Characterizing the “hatred of sound”</strong></p>
<p>Since “misophonia” was <a href="http://w.tinnitus.org/DST_NL2_PJMJ.pdf" target="_blank">first coined</a> in the early 2000’s, efforts have been made to characterize its symptoms through patient interview. Although its prevalence remains uncertain due to its still relative obscurity, studies suggest that it typically strikes in <a href="http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0054706" target="_blank">adolescence</a>, affects men and women equally, and may occur in much as 20% of the <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24752915" target="_blank">population</a>. The most commonly reported trigger sounds include eating, breathing or repetitive behaviors like typing or pen clicking. Hearing such sounds often evokes uncontrollable irritation, disgust or anger, which the individual recognizes as socially inappropriate. Therefore, the misophonic may try to suppress any outward reaction, with few acting upon their urges with verbal or physical aggression. These aversive responses in fact manifest as measurable physiological arousal. Compared to healthy controls, misophonic individuals have <a href="http://journal.frontiersin.org/article/10.3389/fnhum.2013.00296" target="_blank">excessive skin conductance responses</a> to auditory stimuli, and the magnitude of these skin responses correlates with how distressing the participants perceive the sounds.</p>
<p><strong>An undiagnosed disorder?</strong></p>
<p>The symptoms of misophonia largely overlap with other clinically accepted psychiatric disorders, including obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD), post-traumatic stress disorder, and various phobias. Some individuals reporting misophonic symptoms also have comorbid psychiatric conditions such as attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder, hypochondria, OCD, or <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24431300" target="_blank">eating disorders</a>. Although some <a href="http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0054706" target="_blank">experts advise</a> that misophonia be identified as a unique psychiatric disorder, it has yet to be included in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5). Miren Edelstein, a graduate student at the University of California San Diego who researches misophonia, explains that</p>
<blockquote><p>“The uncertainty surrounding the official status of misophonia as a discrete disorder stems from the fact that it does indeed have some similarities with other existing conditions. However, while some misophonics definitely do suffer from some of these other existing conditions, many do not and report no other ailments whatsoever. Because of this variation, I don’t believe another existing disorder can completely account for the specific constellation of symptoms present in misophonia.”</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>The misophonic brain</strong></p>
<p>Despite an advancing understanding of the psychological and behavioral manifestations of misophonia, little research has attempted to clarify its neurobiological bases. Researchers suspect that misophonia is not a primary auditory disorder, but rather stems from aberrant attentional or emotional processing later in the brain’s auditory system. There is preliminary support for this explanation from one small <a href="http://journal.frontiersin.org/article/10.3389/fnbeh.2014.00123" target="_blank">EEG study</a>. In an oddball auditory paradigm, misophonic participants showed a smaller N1 evoked potential than controls elicited by unexpected auditory tones, whereas the “pre-attentive” P1 component showed no group difference. The N1 is involved in early attention and detecting sensory changes, suggesting that abnormal attentional signaling early in the auditory processing stream may contribute to misophonia. Interestingly, an altered N1 peak has also been associated with impulsivity, drug abuse and bipolar disorder.</p>
<p>Recently, <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5321671/" target="_blank">researchers used fMRI</a> to examine brain activity in misophonic individuals while they listened to sounds that were neutral, unpleasant or characteristic misophonia triggers. The misophonics rated the trigger sounds as more distressing than the unpleasant or neutral sounds, whereas normal controls rated trigger and unpleasant sounds as similarly annoying, confirming a selective intolerance for triggers by misophonics. Critically, the misophonics showed greater activation in the insula than controls during trigger sounds, and this activity increased with greater reported distress. Furthermore, functional connectivity between the insula and other brain regions involved in attention and emotion was altered in misophonics when listening to trigger sounds. Although the insula has been promiscuously implicated in a plethora of cognitive processes, its proposed functions include internal awareness of one’s body and emotional states. Though preliminary, these findings suggest that misophonia is associated with pathological activation of a brain network supporting interception. Edelstein, who was not involved in this study, comments “There was a huge gap in the literature until recently. I think this study was a triumphant effort towards gleaning neurophysiological insights on misophonia and its findings fit nicely into the narrative emerging from behavioral research on misophonia.”</p>
<p>It has also been proposed that altered brain connectivity underlying misophonia may be similar to that occurring in synesthesia, a condition in which one sensory stimulus evokes sensation in a different modality (e.g., the letter “A” is associated with the color red). Faulty enhanced neural connections could theoretically lead to abnormal associations amongst sensory and emotional brain regions in misophonia, although this hypothesis remains untested.</p>
<p><strong>Pacifying sound distress</strong></p>
<p>Given the novelty of misophonia, effective therapies have been inadequately assessed. However, there is some support for the use of <a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0165032716321681" target="_blank">cognitive behavioral therapy</a> and <a href="https://www.thieme-connect.com/products/ejournals/html/10.1055/s-0034-1372527" target="_blank">conditioning retraining</a>. Hopefully, with further research into both its psychological profile and neurobiological underpinnings, misophonia will gain both greater social acceptance and effective treatment options.</p>

A new study examines the blurry distinction between "hard" and "soft" drugs.



The "hardness" of drugs is a concept that makes intuitive sense, but is difficult to put into precise terms. "Hard" drugs are those which are viewed as more addictive, more potent and more toxic than the comparatively benign "soft" variety. The concept has a normative aspect: "hard" drugs are bad, and you should avoid them, even if you use soft drugs.

<p><em>By</em> <a href="http://www.alexfradera.net/">Alex Fradera</a></p>
<p>Evasive politicians tend to pay for their slipperiness, according to <a href="http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0261927X17706960">new research</a> in <i>Journal of Language and Social Psychology</i>. To study the art of the dodge, David Clementson of Ohio State University created videos of a male politician with no obvious party affiliation (he was played by an actor, but the participants thought he was a real politician), who was quizzed on a number of topics by a news reporter. In some versions of the video the politician played it entirely straight, but in others he dodged one of the questions, either by switching topics, or by giving a terse “no comment”. Either evasion led to the politician being rated as less trustworthy, both by a young group of 200 American university students, and a more seasoned group of 200 US citizens with an average age of 57.</p>
<p><span id="more-25859"></span></p>
<p>Clementson also looked at whether participants’ political leanings made any difference. He found those who more strongly affiliated with the Republican party were less likely to notice the politician refusing to answer a question. However, compared to politically unaligned participants, both affiliated Republicans and Democrats alike were more likely to spot when the politician swapped topics, perhaps because once you notice this technique used by your political enemies, it begins to jump out at you. This study used an unaffiliated politician as the question-dodger; future work could present partisan figures to whether we turn a blind eye to slipperiness on our own side.</p>
<p>The results seem to suggest that observing a politician dodge a question influences our attitude about their trustworthiness. But it’s also possible that our existing attitude affects whether we observe the dodge in the first place – perhaps we’re less likely to spot dodges made by people we trust. This study design can’t answer this for certain, but Clementson conducted some further statistical analysis and based on this he thinks there’s some causality in both directions. If so, it’s all the more reason for us to pay attention to the facts of the matter, and not mere appearances: detect, or get dodged on.</p>

I've recently been doing some of every academic's favorite activity - marking student essays (papers).



Here's a few observations on essays and on marking them.



1. Marking Essays is Subjective

This is a bit of a truism: it's fairly obvious that not everyone will agree on how to grade an essay down to the exact mark. Unlike with, say, a multiple-choice exam, marking an essay is not a mechanical process. But it's easy to forget this when the marks are there in black and white (or r

<p>As opposed to the free software community, where I've been around long enough to know what's where, I'm still relatively new to the neuroscience community. Over the two years that I've been doing my PhD, I've found a few neuroscience related mailing lists, but not any chat channels. Various teams tend to use <a class="reference external" href="https://slack.com/">Slack</a> or another platform for internal communications, but nothing seems to be set up for the community in general - an open for all channel.</p>
<p>Mailing lists are extremely useful, but by design they are suited to particular types of tasks. They are very well suited for longer discussions, and general queries that are not time sensitive, for example. On the other hand, they do not work well for urgent queries, and of course, sometimes sending e-mails back and forth is quite an overhead for simpler tasks or collaborative development.</p>
<p>Most open source communities have both mailing lists and chat channels. I figured it'd be nice to have one for the neuroscience community too. There's the question of what platform was best suited, of course. We use <a class="reference external" href="https://slack.com/">Slack</a> for our internal communication, but <a class="reference external" href="https://slack.com/">Slack</a> only works well for small teams. It isn't designed for larger communities. The <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Relay_Chat">IRC</a> is ideal for larger communities, but on the flip side, the <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Relay_Chat">IRC</a> is not very user friendly.</p>
<p>The third option, and the popular alternative to IRC and Slack, is <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/gitterHQ">Gitter</a> - it's been recently <a class="reference external" href="https://about.gitlab.com/2017/03/15/gitter-acquisition/">acquired by GitLab</a> and will be completely open sourced soon. It's completely free to use unlike <a class="reference external" href="https://slack.com/">Slack</a> where one needs to pay more as the number of group members increases, and is designed for large communities that number in the thousands. One can login using either Github or Twitter - so that's quite convenient too. There's even an <a class="reference external" href="https://irc.gitter.im/">IRC gateway</a> for more technical users.</p>
<p>So here's the channel then - <a class="reference external" href="https://gitter.im/neuroscience-central/Lobby">https://gitter.im/neuroscience-central/Lobby</a>. I hope it'll be useful, and if it doesn't, well no harm done :)</p>

<p>Self-control has been dubbed a “master virtue” – one which enables so many others, such as selflessness and perseverance. Indeed, better control of short-term impulses in conflict with long-term goals is linked to everything from <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21300864">greater health to greater wealth</a>. It’s no surprise, then, that schools are adopting strategies designed to improve their students’ self-control, under the assumption that there is no downside. But is there…?</p>
<p>Some researchers have argued that there might be. High levels of self-control might promote obsessive-compulsive tendencies, or a dysfunctional kind of perfectionism, in which a person rigidly strives for unreachable standards. Another potential downside has been suggested: <a href="http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/1745691610393523">“Too much” self-control</a> might lead to “frequent and sometimes unnecessary regulation of emotions, thoughts and behaviours, resulting in a life marked by rigidity and blandness, thereby lowering subjective wellbeing” note the authors of a<b> </b><a href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jopy.12322/full">new paper</a> on the topic, published in the <em>Journal of Personality</em>.<b> </b></p>
<p><span id="more-25833"></span></p>
<p>To date, there’s been little actual research to investigate the interplay between changing levels of self-control and wellbeing. So the team – led by Christopher Wiese at Purdue University and including Roy Baumeister of willpower fame and Angela Duckworth, known for her work on “grit” –  ran a series of six studies involving a total of more than 5,000 schoolchildren, college undergraduates and adults aged up to 55.</p>
<p>In the first study, middle-school children (aged 10-14) completed a questionnaire about their impulsivity, their teachers also rated the kids’ self-control, and the children also reported their subjective wellbeing, including how often they experienced positive and negative moods and their overall life satisfaction. This allowed the researchers to see if having especially high or low self-control was related to feelings of well being.</p>
<p>Further studies with university students and a community sample of adults were similar, but in one case there was a real-world test of the ability to resist temptation, which involved persisting with a boring computer task while resisting fun distractions. Another of the studies used a “day reconstruction method”, in which participants recalled how much self-control they had exercised during different activities in a given day, and how they had felt during each activity.</p>
<p>The results of all these investigations? In the researchers’ words, “Self-control enhances subjective wellbeing with little to no apparent downside of too much self-control.” The “little” cost to well being that they did find related to the giving up of immediate pleasures for future gain. Since “these [future] benefits outweigh the loss of in-the-moment pleasures,” the net result was  “overall higher [subjective wellbeing],” the researchers wrote.</p>
<p>There were a few limitations with the research. Perhaps most glaring was the lack of longitudinal data (the same participants were not followed over time) or any kind of experimental test to see the consequences of exercising different levels of self-control. This meant the researchers couldn’t explore, for example, whether people may start to feel less good about repeatedly exerting self-control in the long term. It also means it’s not possible to say based on this research whether over periods of weeks, months and years, self-control affects well being levels, or if happier people simply tend to exert more self-control. However, the researchers said they believe their results provide “preliminary support” for promoting self-control among school-aged children, as well as in adults.</p>

<img alt="" class="attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image" height="110" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2017/06/featured-140x110.png" style="display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;" width="140" /><p>The western honeybee <em>Apis mellifera</em> is probably one of the most famous pollinators and has a key role in the terrestrial ecosystem. Humans have domesticated honeybees for perhaps more than 9000 years, but wild populations still exist. As beekeeping became more global, honeybees were moved out their native area and are now nearly cosmopolitan. Their wide geographic distribution shows that honeybees have the ability to adapt to very different new environments.</p>
<p>Originally, <em>Apis mellifera</em> was distributed only in Europe, Africa, the Middle East, and some parts of Asia. The exact point of origin of the western honeybee is still hard to identify, but over the last decades, five major evolutionary groups have been defined. The evolutionary complexity does not stop there, as honeybees have evolved no less than 31 recognized subspecies that can readily hybridize. The most famous example to date is the Africanized honeybee, the result of admixture between the divergent African and European lineages.</p>

TECHER</div><div class="attachment-image--source"></div></figure>
<p>Given its intimate relationship with human movements, it can be rather hard to be sure about the honeybee presence in some regions. This difficulty is even more relevant for young isolated island systems in which the natural history before human arrival is often unclear or non-exhaustive. One illustration of such a case is the honeybee populations from the South West Indian Ocean islands (SWIO).</p>
<p>In this area, Madagascar and three archipelagos form one of the major hotspots of biodiversity with a high proportion of endemic species. In 1804, Pierre André Latreille described a honeybee subspecies <em>Apis mellifera unicolor</em> that is endemic to Madagascar. It is open to debate as to whether honeybees were present in the Mascarene, Seychelles and Comoros archipelagos before humans.</p>
<p>Concerns about its status were raised because of reported importations in the Mascarene and Seychelles archipelagos. Indeed, the influence of beekeeping was previously proven in Rodrigues (the far-eastern island of the Mascarenes) as a genetic study showed the <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s13592-014-0335-9">exclusive presence of European Carnolian and Italian honeybees.</a> However, this situation was exceptional as <a href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/icad.12138/abstract.">Seychelles honeybees were African and genetically related to <em>A. m. unicolor</em> from Madagascar</a>.</p>
<figure class="wp-caption alignright" id="attachment_9193" style="width: 1395px;"><img alt="" class="size-full wp-image-9193" height="855" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2017/06/bee.jpg" width="1385" /><div class="attachment-image--caption"><em>Apis mellifera</em> <em>unicolor</em> worker © A. FRANCK – CIRAD</div><div class="attachment-image--source"></div></figure>
<p>Given such contrasting patterns, it seemed rather complicated to predict which lineages or subspecies were present in the rest of the SWIO islands. In our latest mitochondrial study, the ancestral genetic identity of honeybees from the Mascarene and Comoros was partly unraveled. Using one of the largest sampling efforts conducted for honeybees in African regions, we helped to retrace the maternal ancestry lineage using two markers. The genetic diversity observed was compared to potential source populations like Madagascar and 19 continental countries.</p>
<p>Interestingly, the results showed that SWIO honeybees mainly presented <em>Apis mellifera unicolor</em> sequences in 10 islands out of the 11 targeted (all except Rodrigues). Not only were the honeybees from the archipelagos more closely related to Madagascar, but they formed with it a novel African mitochondrial group. One way for these honeybees to reach these isolated islands despite the ocean barrier would have been <em>via</em> human importations.</p>
<figure class="wp-caption alignleft" id="attachment_9209" style="width: 788px;"><img alt="" class="size-full wp-image-9209" height="728" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2017/06/Teacher-figure-1.gif" width="778" /><div class="attachment-image--caption">Evolutionary lineages transition within <em>Apis mellifera</em> native range using COI-COII region and distribution in the South West Indian Ocean archipelagos. See article for full details.</div><div class="attachment-image--source">Techer et al. 2017</div></figure>
<p> </p>
<p>New private <em>A. m. unicolor</em> derivated sequences found in each of the SWIO islands suggested an alternative hypothesis. This finding more likely points towards a long independent evolution among islands after colonization. It is not new that species that originated from Madagascar were able to cross the ocean barrier and colonize nearby islands. The distance between the islands could have been reduced with sea level fluctuations and/or hurricanes. As the Comoros archipelago diversity suggests, honeybees could have progressively colonized the islands, beginning with the nearest island to the mainland before moving from one neighbouring island to the next.</p>
<p>All these elements support the theory that honeybees could be native to the SWIO archipelagos. Still, European lineage was also retrieved in different frequencies in the Mascarene archipelago, revealing human impact. Until recently, honeybees from these islands were preserved from major worldwide pests such as <em>Varroa destructor</em> thanks to importation restrictions. The diversity of honeybees in the SWIO islands constitutes a unique heritage that deserves special attention.</p>

<p>
 Mechanosensory transduction for senses such as proprioception, touch, balance, acceleration, hearing and pain relies on mechanotransduction channels, which convert mechanical stimuli into electrical signals in specialized sensory cells. How force gates mechanotransduction channels is a central question in the field, for which there are two major models. One is the membrane-tension model: force applied to the membrane generates a change in membrane tension that is sufficient to gate the channel, as in the bacterial MscL channel and certain eukaryotic potassium channels. The other is the tether model: force is transmitted via a tether to gate the channel. The transient receptor potential (TRP) channel NOMPC is important for mechanosensation-related behaviours such as locomotion, touch and sound sensation across different species including Caenorhabditis elegans, Drosophila and zebrafish. NOMPC is the founding member of the TRPN subfamily, and is thought to be gated by tethering of its ankyrin repeat domain to microtubules of the cytoskeleton. Thus, a goal of studying NOMPC is to reveal the underlying mechanism of force-induced gating, which could serve as a paradigm of the tether model. NOMPC fulfils all the criteria that apply to mechanotransduction channels and has 29 ankyrin repeats, the largest number among TRP channels. A key question is how the long ankyrin repeat domain is organized as a tether that can trigger channel gating. Here we present a de novo atomic structure of Drosophila NOMPC determined by single-particle electron cryo-microscopy. Structural analysis suggests that the ankyrin repeat domain of NOMPC resembles a helical spring, suggesting its role of linking mechanical displacement of the cytoskeleton to the opening of the channel. The NOMPC architecture underscores the basis of translating mechanical force into an electrical signal within a cell.

<img alt="" class="attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image" height="110" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2017/06/Photo-3-140x110.jpeg" style="display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;" width="140" /><p>Migrant children are at risk of a variety of physical and mental health problems as a result of their limited access to quality health care, the increased prevalence of infectious diseases in their home countries and the difficult conditions they experience during the process of migration. Many of these conditions are manageable, and if undiagnosed or left untreated, could lead to significant unfavorable health outcomes.</p>
<p>For more than two decades, Greece has been experiencing increased mobility of various populations across its borders. However, there are limited data and information with regards to their health particularly in the case of children.</p>
<p>In our recently published  study in <em>BMC Pediatrics</em> (<a href="https://bmcpediatr.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12887-017-0888-7">Clinical and laboratory evaluation of new immigrant and refugee children arriving in Greece</a>), we prospectively examined all immigrant and refugee children that attended a special outpatient clinic at a large tertiary Children’s Hospital, in Athens, Greece to obtain a health evaluation, within three months of their arrival in the country.</p>
<blockquote><p>Lack of vaccination records and bad oral health were the most prevalent clinical issues</p></blockquote>
<p>Immigrants were defined as children of parents with long-term residence permit entering for family reunification while refugees, asylum seekers or irregular migrants were defined as refugees. Among both groups, we identified distinct clinical problems and certain laboratory abnormalities that differed according to their migration status, age and region of origin.</p>
<p>Inadequate immunization status (insufficient number, inadequate serologic response due to improper storage of vaccinations, or severe malnutrition) places migrant children at risk for vaccine-preventable diseases. 80% of the children in the study had no documentation of vaccination, and this was more prominent among the population of refugees, while bad oral health and especially caries was found in more than 20% of them. A number of children presented with respiratory and skin infections and additional clinical conditions requiring intervention.</p>
<figure class="wp-caption alignnone" id="attachment_9207" style="width: 650px;"><img alt="" class="size-full wp-image-9207" height="427" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2017/06/MSF1-High.jpeg" width="640" /><div class="attachment-image--caption">Photo from the recent vaccination campaign in Greece for refugee children by Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF).</div><div class="attachment-image--source"></div></figure>
<p>More than 40% of migrant children presented lack of protective antibodies to hepatitis B surface antigen (anti-HBs ≥ 10 IU/L), nevertheless, no child was found to be a chronic HBsAg carrier. Latent tuberculosis was detected in 2.7% of our study individuals, and all received BCG vaccination.</p>
<blockquote><p>Lack of protective antibodies against hepatitis B virus, Lead exposure, eosinophilia, anemia and low ferritin were the most common laboratory abnormalities</p></blockquote>
<p>It is well recognized that Lead exposure is the most widespread exposure among migrant children and may have deleterious, long term neurotoxic effects. In one third of our study population, we identified elevated blood lead levels and the odds were increased among younger children, immigrants and those originating from Asia. Additionally, younger children had increased probability of anemia and low ferritin levels.</p>
<p>The volume, speed, and diversity of migration in Greece amid the current socioeconomic crisis are additional challenges we face in providing access to health care services to all migrants. It is evident that collaboration with nongovernmental institutions and health providers at national as well as at international levels is essential.</p>

<img alt="" class="attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image" height="110" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2017/06/anniemokillustration-140x110.jpg" style="display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;" width="140" /><p> </p>
<p>Euthanasia, i.e. the ending of a patient’s life by a physician on explicit patient request, on the grounds of unbearable suffering caused by mental illness is legal only in Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg. Strict due care and procedural criteria are set out to ensure careful practice.</p>
<p>The option of euthanasia is increasingly being considered and discussed in a growing number of countries. Euthanasia remains however a controversial issue, especially when it concerns people suffering from a mental illness, such as major depressive disorder or dementia.</p>
<p>The number of euthanasia cases in Belgium has been increasing year by year since implementation of the euthanasia law in 2002. Euthanasia is <a href="http://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/fullarticle/2426426">most common in cancer patients</a>: in 2015 <a href="http://overlegorganen.gezondheid.belgie.be/nl/documenten/fcee-euthanasie-verslag-2016">68%</a> of all reported cases involved people diagnosed with cancer. In previous years, <a href="http://www.cmaj.ca/content/early/2016/09/12/cmaj.160202.abstract">we found a notable increase in deaths from euthanasia in people with conditions other than cancer, and in those without terminal illness</a>, including people with mental illness.</p>
<p>Taking into account the specific difficulties associated with handling euthanasia requests expressed by people suffering from mental illness, a thorough examination of the practice is vital. Our study adds to and informs the international debate on medically assisted dying in general and in people with mental illness specifically.</p>
<p>One of the procedural criteria for careful euthanasia practice is an obligation of the attending physician to report the euthanasia case for review to the <a href="http://overlegorganen.gezondheid.belgie.be/nl/advies-en-overlegorgaan/commissies/federale-controle-en-evaluatiecommissie-euthanasie">Federal Control and Evaluation Committee for Euthanasia</a>. Information on the euthanasia cases is collected through a standardized registration form.</p>
<p>The Committee collects the anonymous information from the registration forms in a database, which we were allowed to use for research purposes. In our <a href="http://bmcpsychiatry.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12888-017-1369-0">article</a>, we report these data from the start of legalization of euthanasia in 2002 until 2013, which are the latest available data.</p>
<p><img alt="" class="size-medium wp-image-7328 alignleft" height="300" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2016/01/Dementia1-300x300.jpg" width="300" />Our study shows that the number and proportion of euthanasia cases with a psychiatric disorder or dementia diagnosis has increased from 2008 onwards to 3.0% of all cases reported in 2013 (54 cases in 2013). This increase is particularly visible in cases with a diagnosis of mood disorder. In comparison with the total number of reported cases, euthanasia for these specific patient groups remains a limited practice.</p>
<p>The increase in the absolute number of cases is particularly evident in cases with a mood disorder diagnosis. The majority of euthanasia cases with a psychiatric disorder or dementia diagnosis concerned women, ranging from 58.1% in people with dementia to 77.1% in people suffering from mood disorders. All notified cases were judged to comply with the due care criteria specified in the Belgian euthanasia law by the Committee.</p>
<p>Given the highly controversial nature of the practice and the specific complexities associated with handling euthanasia requests expressed by people with mental illness, we strongly recommend more in-depth research on patients’ reasons and physicians’ procedures, as well as on the impact on the family and health care professionals involved.</p>
<p>The evaluation of a euthanasia request is a complex and challenging task for physicians, particularly when a request is based on psychological or existential suffering. Therefore, development of relevant practice guidelines is necessary.</p>
<p>Our <a href="http://bmcpsychiatry.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12888-017-1369-0">article</a> studying euthanasia in the most controversial of patient groups suggests that the legal possibilities of euthanasia legislation are being explored more broadly and have become more and more accepted over the past years in Belgium.</p>

<p>Our autobiographical memory is fundamental to the development of our sense of self. However, according to past research, it may be compromised in autism, together with other skills that are also vital for self understanding, such as introspection and the ability to attribute mental states to others (known as mentalising).</p>
<p>For example, experiments involving autistic children have highlighted retrieval difficulties, “impoverished narratives”, and a greater need for prompting, while also suggesting that semantic recall (facts from the past) may be impaired in younger individuals.</p>
<p>Now a UK research team, led by Sally Robinson from London’s St. Thomas’ Hospital, has published the first attempt to assess the nature of – and relationships between – autobiographical memory, mentalising and introspection in autism. Reporting <a href="http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/1362361316645429">their findings</a> in <i>Autism</i> journal, the group hope their results will shed more light on the way that autistic children and teens develop a sense of self.</p>
<p><span id="more-25798"></span></p>
<p>The researchers compared the performance of 24 autistic participants (age range: 11-18; 4 girls) and 24 age- and gender-matched neurotypical participants on three tasks. The first, designed to tap semantic and episodic aspects of autobiographical memory, required them to recall what kind of personality they showed in different contexts (at school, with the family, when happy etc) and to describe specific episodes from their lives in which they’d behaved as that kind of person.</p>
<p>A second, interview task measured introspection and mentalising: participants rated both their own ability, and that of a nominated comparison individual (such as a friend or relative), to recognise both their own and the other person’s internal/external traits, such as tiredness (internal trait) or smartness of dress (external). For example, in relation to tiredness, participants rated “How well do you know when you feel tired?”; “How well does X know when you are tired?”; “How well do you know when X feels tired?”; and “How well does X know when he/she feels tired?”.</p>
<p>The final task was the widely used mentalising measure, the Reading The Mind In The Eyes Task for children, which involved participants looking at pictures showing only the eye region of person’s face and inferring their mental state.</p>
<p>Overall, the results demonstrated impaired <i>and</i> preserved abilities in the autistic group, while suggesting atypical relationships between skills. In terms of autobiographical memory, the autistic children and teens: a) produced fewer self-descriptive personality traits than the neurotypical group, b) required more prompting to generate specific episodic memories, c) provided fewer memories containing either emotional or sensory detail, but d) <i>did not</i> differ in terms of the number or type of episodic memories recalled.</p>
<p>That the autistic group recalled a typical number of episodic memories, albeit with greater prompting and atypicality of content, is broadly in line with previous work. The recall of fewer own personality traits, however, is a new finding, and is worth investigating further. This may suggest that autistic individuals’ self-concept is atypical.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, on the introspection and mentalising interview, the autistic children and teens (a) rated themselves poorer at knowing about another’s mental state than did the neurotypical group, and b) more surprisingly, they rated others as having more knowledge about their own external/behavioural traits than they did themselves. The researchers suggested that this last finding may betray a lack of confidence in making objective/comparative behavioural judgments – as opposed to subjective internal ones – about the self in relation to others.</p>
<p>Related to this, among the autistic children and teens only, if they rated themselves as having a high level of self-knowledge, they were also more likely to rate others as having a higher knowledge of them. The researchers pointed out that this may highlight the use of introspection as a compensatory strategy in autism, when attributing mental states to others, and that this may play a role in autistic individuals’ documented tendency to over-attribute their own beliefs and knowledge to others.</p>
<p>As expected, the autistic children and teens were poorer than controls on the Eyes Task, another indication of compromised mentalising skills.</p>
<p>There was also a group difference in how the various skills related to each other. In the neurotypical group, performance correlated across the tasks: semantic/episodic autobiographical memory, introspecting and mentalising, which indicates how, in typical development, autobiographical memory has a reciprocal relationship with other aspects of the self-concept. In the autistic children and teens, these correlations were absent, suggesting that this reciprocity between mental processes may be impaired.</p>
<p>Although this study is exploratory and more work is needed, it provides a finer-grained glimpse at how skills associated with self-understanding may interact in autism, and how this may differ from the equivalent processes in typical development.</p>
<p>The new findings may also have implications for autistic children undertaking Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (CBT), an approach where the recall of autobiographical events is important. CBT is commonly used with autistic people to address anxiety and social skill development. In the new research, the autistic group generated as many episodic memories as controls, after having first described their own personality traits. This may suggest that in CBT with autism, accurate episodic retrieval could be supported by first encouraging individuals to reflect on their own personalities in a more general sense.</p>

<img alt="" class="attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image" height="110" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2017/06/business-792176_640-140x110.jpg" style="display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;" width="140" /><p>This week in the UK we’ve been experiencing a heat wave which has left many sweltering in the sun and seeking any available shade. We all know the dangers of sun exposure to our skin but we perhaps overlook the important benefits that it provides through vitamin D synthesis.</p>
<p>Vitamin D is important for the body in several ways and possessing inadequate amounts has been linked to autoimmune conditions; metabolic, respiratory, cardiovascular and psychiatric disorders; as well as cancers and osteoporosis.</p>
<p>We can obtain vitamin D through our diets but an estimated 90% is produced endogenously in healthy adults. To do this our bodies synthesize vitamin D from solar ultraviolet B radiation, making sunlight an essential factor in obtaining recommended vitamin D levels.</p>
<h3><strong>Vitamin D deficiency</strong></h3>
<p>Vitamin D deficiency is prevalent worldwide and even those in sunny locations are at risk of being deficient. Modern occupations trending towards indoor work are likely to play a big role in this as decreased time spent outdoors would be expected to lead to decreased vitamin D levels.</p>
<p>In order to more fully understand the role that occupations play on vitamin D levels and identify those groups at the greatest risk, researchers at the University of Alberta,  Canada performed a systematic review of 71 papers with large population based cohorts that defined occupational groups.</p>
<blockquote><p>Vitamin D deficiency was most prevalent in shift workers (80%) closely followed by indoor workers (77%) and healthcare students (72%).</p></blockquote>
<p>It was found that across all occupational groups, serum 25-(OH)D levels (a measure of vitamin D status in individuals) were below recommendations for optimal levels that are recommended by the Endocrine Society.</p>
<p>Vitamin D deficiency was most prevalent in shift workers (80%) closely followed by indoor workers (77%) and healthcare students (72%). Deficiency levels for practicing physicians, nurses and a group termed ‘other healthcare employees’ were all below 50%.</p>
<p>The findings of the study are consistent with an assumption that workers in an indoor environment would display lower levels of vitamin D compared to those working in outdoor environments.</p>
<p>The author’s state that the high prevalence of vitamin D deficiency in healthcare students and medical residence (72% and 65% respectively) could be due to long working hours combined with additional time spent studying, leading to considerable time spent indoors. This is an alarming find given low vitamin D in young adults may decrease bone density, increasing the risk of osteoporosis later in life.</p>
<p>Perhaps the most worrying statistic is the high levels of vitamin D deficiency seen in shift workers. This deficiency has previously been suggested to be associated with shift workers’ predisposition for musculoskeletal, cardiovascular diseases and cancer. However drawing conclusions on this is complicated given that shift workers may work at various times of the day and may spend more time in daylight outside of conventional working hours.</p>
<h3><strong>Clinical implications</strong></h3>
<blockquote><p>For predominantly indoor occupations such as office work, more encouragement could be given to employees to take breaks outside.</p></blockquote>
<p>Given the high prevalence vitamin D deficiency in shift workers, the authors call for regular screenings of these and other high risk groups to be considered in future clinical practice guidelines. They also call for education on the importance of healthy vitamin D levels, both through sun exposure and dietary intake, to be incorporated into workplace wellness programs.</p>
<p>For predominantly indoor occupations such as office work, more encouragement could be given to employees to take breaks outside, giving their skin more exposure to UV light. This could be aided by revised work schedules allowing for such breaks.</p>
<p>So whether you’re parked by a fan in the midst of a heat wave or confining yourself to an office all day, provided that you avoid excessive exposure, it may be a good idea to venture outside and soak up some sun.</p>

<img alt="" class="attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image" height="110" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2017/06/doctor-563429_960_720-medical-140x110.jpg" style="display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;" width="140" /><p>Stepping up from medical student to junior doctor is known to be a daunting and challenging transition. Though being stretched and ‘thrown in the deep end’ can be beneficial to their learning experience, it also increases stress. While getting to grips with the role in long shifts, they are also responsible for patient care. Can their job role and commitment for patient care be associated with poorer self-care?</p>
<p>This question was investigated by researchers at the <em>Faculty of Medicine, University of Queensland</em>, in a <a href="https://bmcmededuc.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12909-017-0931-2">study</a> led by Dr. Sturman, who reported the experiences junior doctors had during their career development.</p>
<img alt="" class=" wp-image-9183 alignright" height="226" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2017/06/medical-563427_960_720-pixabay-300x200.jpg" width="339" />
<p>Junior doctors were recruited from a range of hospital settings, and interviewed to find out about their experiences when adjusting from the role of medical student to junior doctor. After this process, two clinical academics and an intern conducted a descriptive analysis of the information collected.</p>
<blockquote><p>There’s incredible self-doubt when you become an intern that you don’t have as a medical student.</p></blockquote>
<p>As a result, some persistent concepts arose. Three main themes were ‘steep learning curve’, ‘relationships and team’ and ‘seeking help’. “There’s incredible self-doubt when you become an intern that you don’t have as a medical student” one interviewee said. Overall, the participants described the transition as physically, mentally and emotionally draining.</p>
<p>Key experiences were a decrease in confidence, self-care and social wellbeing. It seems that while the juniors were focused on caring for others, and were happy to raise patient related concerns  with senior staff members, there was an unwillingness to voice their own personal problems.</p>
<p>To try and understand the cause for this, the researchers suggest some key factors in the professionals’ working environment, which may contribute to these negative impacts.</p>
<blockquote><p>You’re both at the bottom and somewhere up in the middle of the food chain at the same time because you are making decisions and directing patient care, but at the same time you’re at the very, very bottom of that chain.</p></blockquote>
<p>The supportive team structure which can alleviate the stress of this experience may be hindered by a divide being in place between senior staff and the junior doctors, as one participant implied – “You’re both at the bottom and somewhere up in the middle of the food chain at the same time because you are making decisions and directing patient care, but at the same time you’re at the very, very bottom of that chain”.</p>
<p>Disconnection between the staff can be further exacerbated by the movement of professionals to and from various teams within the hospital. As shallow relationships are maintained, not only the social wellbeing of the junior doctors, but their skills could be affected.</p>
<p>This study speaks out to medical educators to raise awareness of the personal detriments experienced by junior doctors in this phase of learning, and suggests that improved team support systems and teaching methods could help smooth the bumpy transition from student to professional.</p>
<blockquote><p>The advice that I would give is don’t be afraid, everyone is there to help you and everyone is there to guide you along.</p></blockquote>
<p>It also voices the lessons learnt by junior doctors who have been through this stressful change, as one interviewee said “The advice that I would give is don’t be afraid, everyone is there to help you and everyone is there to guide you along, don’t be afraid to ask questions because ultimately it’s all in the best interest of the patient.”</p>
<p>If the wellbeing of junior doctors were to improve, perhaps this could also have a positive impact on their colleagues, and even the patients that they treat.</p>

<p>The horrific killing of Catherine “Kitty” Genovese in New York in 1964 inspired research into what’s known in social psychology as the Bystander Phenomenon – our increased disinclination to intervene when in the company of others. That’s because early reports told how 38 witnesses to Genovese’s murder did nothing to help. But in fact it’s now clear that <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2007/10/23/the-truth-behind-the-story-of-kitty-genovese-and-the-bystander-effect/">several people did intervene</a>. So the tragedy that inspired research into the Bystander Phenomenon is actually a bad example of that real phenomenon.</p>
<p>But it’s not time yet to leave the sad story alone. As psychologist Saul Kassin documents <a href="http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/1745691616679465">in <em>Perspectives on Psychological Science</em></a>, hidden in the story in plain sight all these decades is an example of another important psychological principle: the power of false confessions. Moreover, in another twist, details have emerged recently of how a few days after her murder, Genovese’s killer, Winston Moseley, was initially detained by members of the public – ironically, given how the Genovese case inspired research into bystander apathy, these bystanders chose to act.</p>
<p><span id="more-25651"></span></p>
<p>Kassin’s perspective on all this is that he has spent years studying the psychology of false confessions, including the surprising number of people who make them, as shown for example by the high proportion of people exonerated by new DNA evidence whose past confessions turn out to have been false. His research has also shown the power of false confessions to sway jurors and witnesses (for instance, on hearing a false confession, witnesses for the defence often lose faith in their own testimony).</p>
<p>This ties into the murder of Kitty Genovese because it seems highly likely that her killer, Winston Moseley, was also responsible for the murder of 15-year-old Barbara Kralik a year earlier, a crime for which high-school drop-out Alvin Mitchell was already on trial.</p>
<p>Mitchell had confessed to Kralik’s murder – so he must have done it, right? Well, his confession came following more than 50 hours of interrogation and he soon recanted it. His first trial ended in a hung jury (11 votes for acquittal, 1 for conviction). However, the power of a confession, even one that’s retracted, does not fade easily. On retrial, Mitchell was found guilty and served 12 years, 8 months in prison. He insisted on his innocence throughout his prison stay and does so today.</p>
<p>Kassin makes a highly persuasive case for Mitchell being innocent of Kralik’s murder and the case being an exemplar of the power of false confessions (if you can get access, it’s worth reading Kassin’s <a href="http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/1745691616679465">entire article</a> to appreciate the full detail of the seemingly flawed case against Mitchell).</p>
<p>Kassin believes Moseley is the true killer of Kralik. Relevant here is that after his arrest for killing Genovese, Mosely also confessed to two more murders. He said he had killed 24-year-old Annie Mae Johnson one month earlier (this confession was corroborated in dramatic fashion after his account of the murder matched the wounds to Johnson’s body), and he said he had killed Kralik. Crucially, Moseley confessed with the same certainty and detail to both these additional murders while he steadfastly denied being responsible for another double-murder that was unsolved at the time time. Mosely repeated his confession to Kralik’s murder in Michell’s first trial. However, for some reason, he refused to provide the same testimony in the re-trial.</p>
<p>In 2014, Kassin travelled to rural Vermont to meet Michell, now in his 70s. Mitchell recalled how he was threatened and intimidated during the police interrogations. “I would have confessed to killing the president because them people had scared me to death,” he said.</p>
<p>“There are lessons to be learned from this part of the [Kitty Genovese] story,” writes Kassin. “The scientific study of police interrogations and confessions is well grounded in basic psychology … Collectively, this research has shown that innocent people can be induced to confess crimes they did not commit, that judges and juries have difficulty assessing confessions as a matter of common sense, and that reforms are needed to mitigate both sets of problems.”</p>
<p>What of the public bystanders who detained Moseley? This, says Kassin, is the “irony that slipped through the cracks”. Five days after he killed Genovese, Mosely was attempting to burgle a home in New York in broad daylight. A neighbour confronted him and disbelieving his excuse (Mosely said he was helping the owners move house) he incapacitated Moseley’s van and alerted another neighbour. This second neighbour called the police and Moseley was soon apprehended by officers nearby; within hours he had confessed to a string of burglaries and three murders, writes Kassin.</p>
<p>“Somehow this part of the Genovese story went unnoticed and without fanfare,” says Kassin. “In a most fitting, if not ironic, conclusion to Moseley’s crime spree, the perpetrator whose actions spawned the narrative of the non responsive urban bystander was capture precisely because of the intervention of urban bystanders!”</p>

<p>Image: This photograph of Kitty Genovese was used in newspaper reports at the time of her death, and Kassin notes that it is actually the mug shot taken of Genovese from when she had been arrested for a minor gambling offence. In a strange coincidence, the lawyer who represented Genovese for that offence, Sidney Sparrow, went on to be Winston Moseley’s assigned counsel.</p>

It was a great chance to learn more about how the physical and the mechanical properties of bacteria can impact their behaviour (<a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0092867416306481?via%3Dihub">link</a>), about how the zebrafish model can be used to study tuberculosis pathogenesis (<a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0092867410001285?via%3Dihub">link</a>) and about the distinctions between the three domains of life: bacteria, archaea and eukaryotes, from a bioenergetics basis (<a href="http://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.1001926">link</a>).</p>
<p><strong>AMR, AMR… oh and AMR</strong></p>
<p>The single most central theme on ASM Microbe 2017 was antimicrobial resistance (AMR) – and rightly so. This was evident first from the address by <a href="https://www.asm.org/index.php/aam-fellows/aam-fellows/fellows-elected-in-2011/item/5011-susan-e-sharp">ASM President Susan Sharp</a>, who spoke about the urgency for a global “one health” solution on AMR. She discussed her representation of ASM at the 2016 United Nations General Assembly focused on AMR, where world leaders expressed concerns ranging from the basic needs of clean water and sanitation, access to effective antibiotics in lower income nations, to overutilization and misutilization of antibiotics in developed countries. ASM has established a multi-stakeholder initiative convening key experts to share and analyse the current status of AMR. We look forward to seeing how this unfolds in the medium term.</p>
<p>However the address on AMR did not end there. A session with the theme “Global response to antimicrobial resistance: can humans win this war?” offered further insight into the dissemination and control of AMR. <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Teresa_Coque">Teresa Coque</a> from the Ramón y Cajal University Hospital gave a thorough talk on the environmental dimension of AMR. She spoke about antimicrobial use, the absence of official legislation, about how the farm can affect hospitals and about the factors that influence antibiotic effects. <a href="https://medicine.uiowa.edu/internalmedicine/profile/michihiko-goto">Michihico Goto</a> from the University of Iowa presented a high level strategy on how to control transmission of AMR in humans. Naturally, the talk focused heavily on hand hygiene and environmental/hospital cleanliness and really made us wonder: “how clean is clean enough?”. Finally, we attended a fantastic talk on positive stewardship interventions to reverse AMR and hospital acquired infections (HAIs) by <a href="http://pure.abdn.ac.uk:8080/portal/en/persons/ian-gould(91b2e4f3-b154-41b1-a415-4156b3868e0f).html">Ian Gould</a> from the University of Aberdeen. His talk ended with him presenting an interesting re-make of the song ‘Knocking on Heavens Door’ by Bob Dylan. Jump to the end of this blog to read the lyrics!</p>
<p><em>BMC Microbiology</em> recognises the trend on AMR and plans to respond soon with a new special issue on a very relevant and important topic – stay tuned!</p>
<p><strong>A keynote address… out of this world!</strong></p>
<p>NASA astronaut and virologist <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/astronauts/biographies/kathleen-rubins">Dr. Kate Rubins</a> delivered an inspiring keynote address about her journey through space. Her story about how it all started never seizes to amaze:</p>
<p><em>“I was procrastinating while applying for a grant when one of my friends found a federal government job posting for astronaut applications and encouraged me to apply for fun.”</em></p>
<p>She ended up being selected by NASA in 2009 between 18,000 applications. She then participated on an intense three year training course, which involved survival training in water and land, flying a T-38 supersonic fighter jet trainer (!), as well as learning how to do a spacewalk. Dr. Rubins completed her first spaceflight on Expedition 48/49, where she became the first person to sequence DNA in space. She spent 115 days in space and conducted two spacewalks.</p>
<figure class="wp-caption alignright" id="attachment_9190" style="width: 210px;"><img alt="" class="wp-image-9190 size-full" height="299" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2017/06/astro-kate.jpg" width="200" /><div class="attachment-image--caption">NASA</div><div class="attachment-image--source"></div></figure>
<p>Her stories about her time sequencing DNA at the International Space Station in the absence of gravity, paired with her knowledge on real-time data analysis, the importance of microbial environments in orbit, and emerging technologies, was a fascinating look into the power of the microbial sciences.</p>
<p>Dr. Rubins also spoke about the international nature of the team of astronauts and cosmonauts with which she spent countless hours training and working tirelessly as a unit, before and during their space trip. She sent a clear message against discrimination and she promoted unity, values that should rightly be elevated, especially in our times. It was very well received.</p>

                <h4><a href="http://feeds.nature.com/~r/NatureBiologicalSciencesResearch/~3/1u6TF953ptY/nature23267">Unique roles for histone H3K9me states in RNAi and heritable silencing of transcription</a></h4>

<p>
 Heterochromatic DNA domains play important roles in regulation of gene expression and maintenance of genome stability by silencing repetitive DNA elements and transposons. From fission yeast to mammals, heterochromatin assembly at DNA repeats involves the activity of small noncoding RNAs (sRNAs) associated with the RNA interference (RNAi) pathway1–9. Typically, sRNAs, originating from long noncoding RNAs, guide Argonaute-containing effector complexes to complementary nascent RNAs to initiate histone H3 lysine 9 di- and tri-methylation (H3K9me2 and H3K9me3, respectively) and heterochromatin formation10–17. H3K9me is in turn required for recruitment of RNAi to chromatin to promote sRNA amplification11,15,18. Yet, how heterochromatin formation, which silences transcription, can proceed by a co-transcriptional mechanism that also promotes sRNA generation remains paradoxical. Here, using Clr4, the fission yeast S. pombe homolog of mammalian SUV39H H3K9 methyltransferases, we designed active site mutations that block H3K9me3, but allow H3K9me2 catalysis. We show that H3K9me2 defines a functionally distinct heterochromatin state that is sufficient for RNAi-dependent co-transcriptional gene silencing (CTGS) at pericentromeric DNA repeats. Unlike H3K9me3 domains, which are transcriptionally silent, H3K9me2 domains are transcriptionally active, contain modifications associated with euchromatic transcription, and couple RNAi-mediated transcript degradation to the establishment of H3K9me domains. The two H3K9me states recruit reader proteins with different efficiencies, explaining their different downstream silencing functions. Furthermore, transition from H3K9me2 to H3K9me3 is required for RNAi-independent epigenetic inheritance of H3K9me domains. Our findings demonstrate that H3K9me2 and H3K9me3 define functionally distinct chromatin states and uncover a mechanism for formation of transcriptionally permissive heterochromatin that is compatible with its broadly conserved role in sRNA-mediated genome defense.

<p>In 2005, the U.S. Office of Research Integrity found an obesity researcher had engaged in scientific misconduct. More specifically, the ORI report revealed that Eric Poehlman, then based at the University of Vermont, had “falsified and fabricated” data in 10 papers.

<p>Children are central to the <a href="https://data.unicef.org/children-sustainable-development-goals/">2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development</a>. The 2030 agenda consists of 17 global goals with 169 targets between them which is measured by 230 specific indicators. 50 of these indicators are directly related to children. In 2015, child mortality for those aged under 5 was 5.9 million, which is almost 16,000 a day. It has been found that 83% of these deaths were due to infectious, neonatal, and nutritional conditions. China has seen a decline in under-5 mortality rate in the past 3 decades and it is one of the few countries to have achieved <a href="http://www.un.org/millenniumgoals/">Millennium Development Goals</a> (MDG) 4 (<a href="http://www.un.org/millenniumgoals/childhealth.shtml">reduce child mortality</a>) and 5 (<a href="http://www.un.org/millenniumgoals/maternal.shtml">improve maternal health</a>). Certain provinces in China have also been reported to have achieved this decrease in under-5 mortality rates <a href="http://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(16)00093-3/fulltext">twice as fast</a> as the MDG 4 target rate. It has been <a href="http://www.wpro.who.int/china/mediacentre/factsheets/mch/en/">reported</a> that Chinese children’s health status has improved remarkably and the rate of infant mortality and under-five mortality continue to decline.</p>
<figure class="wp-caption alignright" id="attachment_9180" style="width: 310px;"><img alt="" class="size-medium wp-image-9180" height="225" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2017/06/Image-by-Flickr-user-Micah-Sittig-CC-BY-2.0-300x225.jpg" width="300" /><div class="attachment-image--caption">Image by Flickr user Micah Sittig (CC BY 2.0)</div><div class="attachment-image--source"></div></figure>
<p>However, large disparities have also been found across the region. Although some provinces rivals the best results in the world with relation to under-5 mortality, the reality is very different in other provinces. Preterm birth, low birth weight, birth asphyxia, childhood pneumonia, and diarrhoea are amongst the major threats to infants in <a href="http://www.wpro.who.int/china/mediacentre/factsheets/mch/en/">some areas</a> of China. Efforts are therefore needed to address this <a href="http://thelancet.com/journals/langlo/article/PIIS2214-109X(16)30360-6/fulltext">disparity</a> and to close such gaps in subnational units seen within China.</p>
<p><strong>Nutrition</strong></p>
<p>A healthy diet and adequate nutrition is necessary to ensure optimum growth and development of children. About one third of child deaths worldwide are linked to malnutrition. This is a major health problem seen in China as well. <a href="http://www.who.int/bulletin/volumes/94/10/15-167031/en/">Climate change</a> also poses a new challenge in the control of undernutrition in this region, a matter which is already a concern particularly in poor rural areas.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.unicef.org/nutrition/index_66188.html">Chronic nutritional deficiency</a> during the first 1,000 days of a child’s life can result in stunting where the damage caused to the child’s development is irreversible. It is estimated that in China, <a href="https://www.unicef.org/eapro/media_20532.html">12.7 million</a> children are stunted, which is equivalent to the population size of Tokyo. A <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?cmd=Retrieve&amp;db=PubMed&amp;list_uids=27109127&amp;dopt=Abstract">national survey</a> carried out in China in 2013 showed that 8.1%, 2.4% and 1.9% of children under 5 years of age were stunted, underweight, and wasted, respectively. Results from a community based cross-sectional survey carried out by <a href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/cch.12148/full">Jiang and colleagues</a> in 84 villages in mid-western provinces of China in 2010 showed that malnutrition is a major public health problem among children and the prevalence of stunting and severe stunting was 27.0% and 13.2%, respectively. Location has been found to have a large impact on nutritional status in China. The risk of underweight and stunting is 3-4 times higher for children in rural areas than for those in cities.</p>
<p>Over the years improvements in these figures emerging from China can be seen. The level of undernourishment in the country was <a href="http://www.wfp.org/stories/10-facts-about-nutrition-china">reduced</a> from 23.9% in 1990 – 1992 to 9.3% in 2014 – 2016. Mortality in children under the age of 5 due to malnutrition also <a href="http://www.wfp.org/stories/10-facts-about-nutrition-china">dropped</a> from 22% to 13% between 2000 and 2010. Although the data illustrates that progress has been made resulting in a decline in stunting, underweight and wasting amongst children, the <a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0895398816300320">prevalence of undernutrition</a> remains high for children under 5 in rural areas.</p>

<p>China is the world’s largest greenhouse-gas emitter. It has been reported that the peak in China’s emissions of such gases could come by <a href="http://www.who.int/bulletin/volumes/94/10/15-167031/en/">2025</a>, if not sooner. At the United Nations climate summit which took place in 2015, China committed to halting the growth in its greenhouse gas emissions by 2030 where the new plans call for a reduction of <a href="https://www.nature.com/news/china-s-carbon-emissions-could-peak-sooner-than-forecast-1.19597">18% in carbon dioxide</a> emission and a <a href="http://www.who.int/bulletin/volumes/94/10/15-167031/en/">15% decrease in energy consumption</a>. Children are particularly vulnerable to the effects of air pollution. China has seen an increase of childhood asthma and there are <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20801627">studies</a> emerging which demonstrate a <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4311080/">positive correlation</a> between high levels of outdoor pollution with children’s respiratory symptoms.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>It is evident that the world cannot reach a number of the SDG <a href="https://data.unicef.org/children-sustainable-development-goals/">targets</a> in the 2030 agenda unless the specific needs of children are monitored and addressed. Although improvements and progress have been seen in certain circumstances, there is still more that needs to be done to ensure that children are provided with the necessary to live healthy lives and achieve their full potential. More needs to be done to ensure that no child is left behind.</p>

<p>A Nature journal has posted a editor’s note to a recent letter on potential unintended consequences of CRISPR gene editing, after an executive at a company trying to commercialize the technology said the paper should be retracted. The original article, published on May 30 as a correspondence in Nature Methods, suggested that using CRISPR in mice […]</p>

<p>Being able to measure time, whether directly or indirectly, is a significant
advantage for an organism. It permits it to predict regular events, and prepare
for them on time. Thus, clocks are ubiquitous in biology. In the presented paper,
we consider the most minimal abstract pure clocks and investigate their
characteristics with respect to their ability to measure time. Amongst others
we find fundamentally diametral clock characteristics, such as oscillatory
behaviour for local time measurement or decay-based clocks measuring time
periods in scales global to the problem. We also include cascades of
independent clocks ("clock bags") and composite clocks with controlled
dependency; the latter show various regimes of markedly different dynamics.</p>

<p>As with the role of reviewer, junior scientists submitting their work as authors are given little (if any) guidance on how to interact with their reviewers. Interactions with reviewers are an incredibly valuable opportunity to improve your manuscript and find the best way of presenting your science. However, all too often responding to reviewers is seen as an onerous chore, which partly reflects the attitude we take into the process. These exchanges largely happen in private and even though they play a critical role in academia, we rarely talk about them in public. We think this needs to change – here are some pointers for how to interact with your reviewers.</p>
<ul>
<li>Engage with the spirit of the review</li>
</ul>
<p>Your reviewers will be representative of a portion of your intended readership. Sometimes when reading reviewers’ comments we can find ourselves asking “have they even read the paper?!”. But if the reviewer has misunderstood some critical aspect of the paper then it is entirely possible that a proportion of the broader readership will also. An apparently misguided review, whilst admittedly frustrating, should be taken as a warning sign. Give yourself a day or two to settle your temper, and then recognise that this is your opportunity to make your argument clearer and more convincing.</p>
<p>Similarly, resist the temptation to undertake the minimal possible revisions in order to get your paper past the reviewers. If a reviewer makes a good point and you can think of ways of using your data to address it, then go for it, even if this goes beyond what they specified. Remember – this is your last chance to make this manuscript as good as it can be.</p>
<ul>
<li>Be grateful and respectful. But don’t be afraid to disagree with your reviewers.</li>
</ul>
<p>Writing a good review takes time. Thank the reviewers for their efforts. Be polite and respectful, even if you think a review is not particularly constructive. But don’t be afraid to disagree with reviewers. Sometimes reviewers ask you to do things that you don’t think are valid or wise, and it’s important to defend your work. No one wants a dog’s dinner of a paper… a sort of patchwork of awkwardly combined paragraphs designed to appease various reviewer comments. As the author you need to retain ownership of the work. This will mean that sometimes you need to explain why a recommendation has not been actioned. You can acknowledge the importance of a reviewer’s point, without including it in your manuscript.</p>
<p>We have both experienced reviewers who have requested changes we don’t feel are legitimate. Examples include the reviewer who requested a correlational analysis on a sub-group with a sample size of n=17. Or the reviewer who asked Sue to describe how her results, from a study with participants aged 18 and over, might relate to early signs of autism in infancy (answer: they have no bearing whatsoever and I’m not prepared to speculate in print). Or the reviewer who asked for inclusion of variables in a regression analysis which did not correlate with the outcome, (despite that being a clearly-stated criterion for inclusion in the analysis), on the basis of their personal hunch. In these cases, politely but firmly refusing to make a change may be the right thing to do, though you can nearly always provide some form of concession. For example, in the last case, you might include an extra justification, with a supporting citation, for your chosen regression method.</p>
<ul>
<li>Give your response a clear and transparent structure</li>
</ul>
<p>With any luck, your revised manuscript will go out to the same people who reviewed it the first time.  If you do a particularly good job of addressing their comments – and if the original comments themselves were largely minor – your editor may even decide your manuscript doesn’t need peer review a second time. In any case, to maximise the chances of a good result it is essential that you present your response clearly, concisely and fluently.</p>
<p>Start by copying and pasting the reviewer comments into a document.  Organise them into numbered lists, one for each reviewer.  This might mean breaking down multi-part comments into separate items, and you may also wish to paraphrase to make your response a bit more succinct.  However, beware of changing the reviewer’s intended meaning!</p>
<p>Then provide your responses under each numbered point, addressed to the editor (“The reviewer makes an excellent point and…”). In each case, try to: acknowledge the validity of what the reviewer is saying; briefly mention how you have addressed the point; give a page reference.  This ‘response to reviewers’ document should be accompanied by an updated manuscript in which any significant areas of new text , or heavily edited text, are highlighted <span style="color: #ff0000;">something like this</span>. Don’t submit a revised manuscript with tracked changes – these are too detailed and messy for a reviewer to have to navigate – and don’t feel the need to highlight every changed word.</p>
<p>If it’s an especially complicated or lengthy response, then it is sometimes a good idea to include a (very) pithy summary up top for the Editor, before you get to the reviewer-specific response. A handful of bullet points can help orient the Editor to the major changes that they can expect to find in the new version of your manuscript.</p>
<ul>
<li>The response letter can be a great place to include additional analyses that didn’t make it into the paper</li>
</ul>
<p>Often when exploring the impact of various design choices or testing the impact of assumptions on your analysis, additional comparisons can be very useful. We both often include additional analyses in our ‘response to reviewer’ letters. This aids transparency and can also be a useful way of showing reviewers that your findings are solid. Sometimes these will be analyses that have been explicitly asked for, but on other occasions you may well want to do this from your initiative. As reviewers we are both greatly impressed when authors use their own data to address a point, even if we didn’t explicitly ask them to do this.</p>
<p>One word of warning here, however. Remember that you don’t want to put an important piece of information or line of reasoning only in your response letter, if it ought also to be in the final manuscript. If you’ve completed an extra analysis as part of your consideration of a reviewer point, consider whether this might also have relevance to your readership when the paper is published.  It might be important to leave it out – you don’t want to include ‘red herring’ analyses or look like you are scraping the statistical barrel by testing ‘til the cows come home. But on the other hand, if the analysis directly answers a question which is likely to be in your reader’s mind, consider including it.  This could be as a supplement, linked online data set, or a simple statement: e.g. “we repeated all analyses excluding n=2 participants with epilepsy and results were the same”.</p>
<ul>
<li>Sometimes you may need the nuclear option</li>
</ul>
<p>We have both had experiences where we have been forced to make direct contact with the Action Editor. A caveat to all the points above is that there are occasions where reviewers attempt to block the publication of a manuscript unreasonably. Duncan had an experience of a reviewer who simply cut and paste their original review, and reused it across multiple subsequent rounds of revision. Duncan thought that his team had done a good job of addressing the reviewer’s concerns, where possible, but without any specific guidance from the reviewer they were at a loss to identify what they should do next. Having already satisfied two other reviewers, he decided to contact the Action Editor and explain the situation. They accepted the paper. Sue has blogged <a href="http://www.dart.ed.ac.uk/agony-ecstacy/">before</a> about a paper reporting on a small RCT which was rejected for the simple reason that it reported a null result. She approached the Editor with her concern and it was agreed that the paper should be re-submitted as a new manuscript and sent out again for a fresh set of reviews. This shouldn’t be necessary, but sadly sometimes it is.</p>
<p>Editors will not be happy with authors trying to circumvent the proper review process, but in our experience they are sympathetic to authors when papers are blocked by unreasonable reviewers. After all, we have all been there. If this is the situation you find yourself in, be as diplomatic as possible and outline your concerns to the Editor.</p>
<p>In conclusion, much of what we want to say can probably be summed up with the following: <em>This is not a tick-box exercise, but the last opportunity to improve your paper before it reaches your audience. Engage with your reviewers, be open-minded, and don’t be afraid to rethink. </em></p>
<p>Really, when it comes to responding to reviewers, the clue is in the name.  It’s a <em>response,</em> not a <em>reaction</em> – so be thoughtful, be engaged and be a good scientist.</p><br />  <a href="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gocomments/forgingconnectionsblog.wordpress.com/438/" rel="nofollow"><img alt="" border="0" src="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/comments/forgingconnectionsblog.wordpress.com/438/" /></a> <img alt="" border="0" height="1" src="https://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=forgingconnectionsblog.wordpress.com&amp;blog=78489663&amp;post=438&amp;subd=forgingconnectionsblog&amp;ref=&amp;feed=1" width="1" />

                <h4><a href="http://feeds.nature.com/~r/NatureBiologicalSciencesResearch/~3/kqD6mlTZWCc/nature22989">Phase separation drives heterochromatin domain formation</a></h4>

<p>
 Constitutive heterochromatin is an important component of eukaryotic genomes that has essential roles in nuclear architecture, DNA repair and genome stability, and silencing of transposon and gene expression. Heterochromatin is highly enriched for repetitive sequences, and is defined epigenetically by methylation of histone H3 at lysine 9 and recruitment of its binding partner heterochromatin protein 1 (HP1). A prevalent view of heterochromatic silencing is that these and associated factors lead to chromatin compaction, resulting in steric exclusion of regulatory proteins such as RNA polymerase from the underlying DNA. However, compaction alone does not account for the formation of distinct, multi-chromosomal, membrane-less heterochromatin domains within the nucleus, fast diffusion of proteins inside the domain, and other dynamic features of heterochromatin. Here we present data that support an alternative hypothesis: that the formation of heterochromatin domains is mediated by phase separation, a phenomenon that gives rise to diverse non-membrane-bound nuclear, cytoplasmic and extracellular compartments. We show that Drosophila HP1a protein undergoes liquid–liquid demixing in vitro, and nucleates into foci that display liquid properties during the first stages of heterochromatin domain formation in early Drosophila embryos. Furthermore, in both Drosophila and mammalian cells, heterochromatin domains exhibit dynamics that are characteristic of liquid phase-separation, including sensitivity to the disruption of weak hydrophobic interactions, and reduced diffusion, increased coordinated movement and inert probe exclusion at the domain boundary. We conclude that heterochromatic domains form via phase separation, and mature into a structure that includes liquid and stable compartments. We propose that emergent biophysical properties associated with phase-separated systems are critical to understanding the unusual behaviours of heterochromatin, and how chromatin domains in general regulate essential nuclear functions.

                <h4><a href="http://feeds.nature.com/~r/NatureBiologicalSciencesResearch/~3/mnEOkGPj8y4/nature22976">Identifying specificity groups in the T cell receptor repertoire</a></h4>

<p>
 T cell receptor (TCR) sequences are very diverse, with many more possible sequence combinations than T cells in any one individual. Here we define the minimal requirements for TCR antigen specificity, through an analysis of TCR sequences using a panel of peptide and major histocompatibility complex (pMHC)-tetramer-sorted cells and structural data. From this analysis we developed an algorithm that we term GLIPH (grouping of lymphocyte interactions by paratope hotspots) to cluster TCRs with a high probability of sharing specificity owing to both conserved motifs and global similarity of complementarity-determining region 3 (CDR3) sequences. We show that GLIPH can reliably group TCRs of common specificity from different donors, and that conserved CDR3 motifs help to define the TCR clusters that are often contact points with the antigenic peptides. As an independent validation, we analysed 5,711 TCRβ chain sequences from reactive CD4 T cells from 22 individuals with latent Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection. We found 141 TCR specificity groups, including 16 distinct groups containing TCRs from multiple individuals. These TCR groups typically shared HLA alleles, allowing prediction of the likely HLA restriction, and a large number of M. tuberculosis T cell epitopes enabled us to identify pMHC ligands for all five of the groups tested. Mutagenesis and de novo TCR design confirmed that the GLIPH-identified motifs were critical and sufficient for shared-antigen recognition. Thus the GLIPH algorithm can analyse large numbers of TCR sequences and define TCR specificity groups shared by TCRs and individuals, which should greatly accelerate the analysis of T cell responses and expedite the identification of specific ligands.
