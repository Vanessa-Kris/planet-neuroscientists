The subject was a young woman about to graduate from college. As far as she could tell, she's always had these experiences, and for most of her life she didn't know they were unusual. This <a href="https://neurocritic.blogspot.com/2019/06/the-shock-of-unknown-in-aphantasia.html" target="_blank">surprise</a> upon discovering the uniqueness of one's one internal experience is similar to what is reported by many contemporary individuals with less typical phenomenology, such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aphantasia" target="_blank">aphantasia</a> (the inability to generate visual images).</p><p>Pierce noted that the subject was anosmic (<span class="css-901oao css-16my406 r-poiln3 r-bcqeeo r-qvutc0">had a loss of smell), although this was not formally tested. Nonetheless, he observed:</span></p><p><span class="css-901oao css-16my406 r-poiln3 r-bcqeeo r-qvutc0"></span></p><blockquote>Coffee burning upon a stove is not noticed, though she may be close by. Camphor placed in the nostrils gives only a stinging sensation. Ammonia can be sniffed without discomfort. And, as with all anosmics, foods are discriminated on the basis of the pure taste qualities, or by the characters of texture, astringency, and so on, which any food-complex may possess. These sensory defects are worth noting for their possible significance in connection with the theory of this special case of synæsthesia.</blockquote><p>&nbsp;<br /><br />Some aspects of the report were rather quaint by modern standards (e.g., the first person narration), but others were quite prescient.<br /></p><blockquote>But what evidence have we that an actual case of synæsthesia is here being reported, and not a case of artificial association due to a lively dramatic fancy? This is a point that must be raised, for it is very easy to entertain a suspicion that these phenomena are essentially ungenuine. Now, of course, in matters of this kind general impressions and personal knowledge of the subject count heavily. And on both these grounds I have no hesitation in asserting my conviction that the above-cited equivalents are the expression of a genuine synæsthesia.</blockquote><p></p><p></p><p><br /><br />One key piece of evidence was the consistency of gustatory experiences associated with the same words at a later date:<br /></p><blockquote>...the equivalents possess a constancy which would hardly be possible apart from a true synæsthesia. After an interval of six months a number of words were given at random from the original list, with the result that the identical equivalents were described in almost precisely the same language.</blockquote><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Also, there was a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Somatotopic_arrangement" target="_blank">somatotopic</a>-like arrangement for some of the gustatory experiences:<br /></p><blockquote>Many of the experiences are given quite definite locations in the mouth. Thus the equivalents of <i>Ethel</i> and <i>Hall</i> (tactual) are felt at  the tip of the tongue; of <i>lox</i> (irritation) at the back of the throat; of <i>Judith</i> (salt) at the sides of the tongue; of <i>Sarah</i> (cold) on the lips; of <i>amethyst</i> (bitter) "at the back of the mouth, on the roof, where the root of the tongue seems to hit it" ...</blockquote><p></p><p>&nbsp;<br /></p>Pierce tried to discern whether similar sounds could be related to similar gustatory experiences, but that wasn't the case. Nor were they related to similarities in articulation. He still preferred a physiological explanation, yet...<br /><blockquote>In attempting to decide whether the above-cited experiences are to be explained by the physiological or by the psychological theory, we are, apparently, in no better and in no worse case than in respect to all varieties of synæsthesia. No decisive facts are at hand.</blockquote><p>&nbsp;</p><p>An interesting <a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/article-abstract/444104" target="_blank">commentary</a> in <i>JAMA</i> predated <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/?term=MRI+connectivity+synesthesia&amp;sort=date&amp;size=50" target="_blank">MRI connectivity</a> studies of synesthesia by nearly a century in its speculation about alternative brain wiring:</p><p></p><blockquote>There is little evidence one way or the other as to whether or not this phenomenon is to be explained on purely physiologic grounds, depending on a cross circuiting of the association fibers between different brain centers. </blockquote><p></p><br /><br />Pierce concludes his paper with a pithy aphorism that acknowledges the inconclusiveness of the study:<br /><blockquote><span style="color: #cc0000;"><span style="color: black;">Still, here no less than in all known cases of synaesthesis, </span><b>we can only regret that our theory is so lame while our facts are so secure.</b></span></blockquote><br /><br /> <p> <b>References</b><br /><br />Pierce AH.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/~r/plos/Blog/~3/zhqT8cxAkyg/">2021 DEI goals update</a></h4>

              
                <!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/loose.dtd">
<html><body><p>In April 2021&nbsp;we launched our dedicated <a href="https://plos.org/dei/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">DEI webpage</a> where we outline our commitment to diversity, equity, and inclusion. Our commitment not only includes how we run our organization but also extends to how we execute our mission to accelerate progress in science and medicine by leading a transformation in research communication. Truly Open Science requires direct action.</p>



<p>The <a href="https://plos.org/dei/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">DEI webpage</a> is, however, more than just the words of our commitment. It is also where we transparently share our specific <a href="https://plos.org/dei/#goals" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">DEI goals</a> in order to be held accountable to them. We&rsquo;ve committed to sharing regular progress on this blog, and this is the first of those updates. (PLOS staff will continue to write their own posts about their particular thoughts and activities around DEI, also.)</p>



<p>Some of the goals will suit incremental updates, and some suit annual reporting. We&rsquo;ll link each update below to the particular goal it relates to, and provide links when relevant. We will also be transparent about key setbacks or if we miss any targets, rather than simply glossing over these. </p>



<p><strong>Goal: Increasing the number of historically underrepresented external contributors (e.g. authors, editors, reviewers) and strategic partners.</strong></p>



<ul><li>Our journals are committed to <a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2021/04/launching-new-journals-2021/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">equitable participation</a>, and we&rsquo;re pleased with our progress to create representative editorial boards for our newly launched journals <a href="https://journals.plos.org/climate/s/editorial-board" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>PLOS Climate</em></a><em>, </em><a href="https://journals.plos.org/digitalhealth/s/editorial-board" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>PLOS Digital Health</em></a><em>, </em><a href="https://journals.plos.org/globalpublichealth/s/editorial-board" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>PLOS Global Public Health</em></a><em>, </em><a href="https://journals.plos.org/sustainabilitytransformation/s/editorial-board" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>PLOS Sustainability &amp; Transformation</em></a><em>, </em>and <a href="https://journals.plos.org/water/s/editorial-board" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>PLOS Water</em></a><em>.&nbsp;</em></li><li>We have been particularly successful with diverse representation for <a href="https://journals.plos.org/globalpublichealth/s/editorial-board" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>PLOS Global Public Health</em></a>, and at the end of this post is a video recorded with the journal&rsquo;s Co-Editors-in-Chief and Executive Editor, where they discuss how they managed to assemble this truly global and diverse editorial board.</li><li>Day 1 of our week of programming for the start of our <a href="https://plos.org/scientists-for-open-science/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Scientists for Open Science</a> campaign was dedicated to <a href="https://plos.org/event/inclusion/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Inclusion</a>.&nbsp;</li><li>We are in the final stages of drafting a survey to assess contributor diversity, which will be deployed in Q4 of 2021.</li></ul>



<p><strong>Goal: Developing editorial processes that recognize and minimize bias in the publication process, along high ethical standards.</strong></p>



<ul><li>PLOS has <a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2021/09/announcing-a-new-plos-policy-on-inclusion-in-global-research/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">instituted a new policy</a> to improve transparency in the reporting of research that is conducted in other countries or communities in order to prevent &ldquo;parachute research&rdquo; (also known as &ldquo;helicopter&rdquo; or &ldquo;neo-colonial science&rdquo;). Watch a recorded conversation, below, with some of the stakeholders who helped develop this policy.</li><li>*PLOS has formally joined the multi-publisher initiative to accelerate research culture change, coordinated by the Royal Society of Chemistry (RSC) &ndash;&nbsp; <a href="https://www.rsc.org/new-perspectives/talent/joint-commitment-for-action-inclusion-and-diversity-in-publishing/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Joint commitment for action on inclusion and diversity in publishing</a>. We had been participating and contributing from the start, but this update serves to make the collaboration official, and with pooled resources helps all publishers drive towards this goal.&nbsp;</li><li>*PLOS is also a member of the <a href="https://c4disc.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Coalition for Diversity and Inclusion in Scholarly Communications</a> (C4DISC) and as such commits to uphold its <a href="https://c4disc.org/principles/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">principles</a>.</li></ul>



<p>*A note on industry collaborations: we believe that collaborating with other publishers will help us all develop the methods and metrics to understand the diversity of our collective journals&rsquo; editorial boards, conscious of regional privacy laws and cultures, which in turn will help enable us <em>all </em>to improve diversity, equity, and inclusion.</p>

<p><strong>Goal: Increasing the number of historically underrepresented employees at PLOS, with an emphasis on managerial employee roles.</strong></p>



<ul><li>Through September 2021, we have met our internal sub-goal that every PLOS Leadership Team vacancy (4 vacancies filled in 2021) has included final candidates historically underrepresented in leadership, particularly Black, Latina/o, Indigenous and transgender people. In early 2022, we will report on how this has affected hiring outcomes for 2021.</li><li>We have increased investment by more than 50% to develop our recruiting function and interview methods , which are instrumental in meaningfully changing the way we hire. In September, we conducted a leadership team retrospective on the progress we&rsquo;ve made, what the challenges are, and where we&rsquo;ll focus our efforts in 2022.</li></ul>



<p><strong>Goal: Increasing the quantifiable signals of an inclusive work environment that values divergent perspectives, encourages critical inquiry, and ensures equitable advancement and rewards.</strong></p>



<ul><li>In early 2021, we translated our ideals of &ldquo;diversity&rdquo;, &ldquo;equity&rdquo;, and &ldquo;inclusion&rdquo; into three distinct sets of competencies in which to anchor our goals and development activities</li><li>In March, every leader at PLOS set DEI goals for 2021: goals ranged from raising awareness around key issues to changing processes to produce more equitable outcomes.</li><li>Our Chief People and Equity Officer, Kristina Martin, participated in a C4DISC panel discussion &ldquo;<a href="https://c4disc.org/2021/06/15/ssp-session-the-glass-ceiling-you-dont-know-about-yet-removing-barriers-for-people-with-disabilities-at-work/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Glass Ceiling You Don&rsquo;t Know About Yet: Removing Barriers for People with (Dis)abilities at Work</a>&rdquo;</li><li>On October 12, 2021 we&rsquo;re hosting an internal PLOS &ldquo;Listening Session&rdquo; in which neurodiverse leaders share their lived experiences with Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder, Autism Spectrum Disorder, and Bipolar Disorder.&nbsp;</li><li>In November, managers and employees will have practice sessions for strategies we&rsquo;ve previously introduced to identify and reduce bias.</li><li>While barriers related to privacy, data collection and storage have prevented us from capturing broad diversity data across PLOS&rsquo; global employee population, we are working through the issues and plan to have the systems in place in 2022 to accurately capture data related to hire, retention and progression of employees at PLOS, disaggregated by identity group. In the meantime, we are collecting data for two smaller groups: the PLOS Leadership Team and our DEI Steering Committee. We will share this data in early 2022.</li></ul>



<p><strong>Goal: Increasing the publication of research that studies inequalities, racism, and inequities facing minority and/or marginalized populations (within the scope of each of our journals).</strong></p>



<ul><li>We are still looking into the best way to meaningfully feature articles across our portfolio of journals in this way, and will report in the future. In the meantime, we will share this blog post regarding the mission of <em>PLOS Global Public Health</em>, from the Co-Editors: <a href="https://speakingofmedicine.plos.org/2021/06/14/plos-global-public-health-charting-a-new-path-towards-equity-diversity-and-inclusion-in-global-health/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">PLOS Global Public Health, charting a new path towards equity, diversity and inclusion in global health</a></li></ul>

<p><strong>Probing pharaohs with X-rays</strong> — <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/probing-new-kingdom-pharaohs-x-rays"><em>Science News</em></a>, October 9, 1971</p>



<p>The 29 mummies of pharaohs and queens were examined without disturbing their present positions.… [Researchers using portable X-ray equipment] found evidence of rheumatoid inflammation of the vertebrae of Amenophis II, ruler of Egypt from 1436 to 1413 B.C…. [A queen] was buried with what was thought to be her mummified infant. But radiography of the object confirmed its identification as a mummified adolescent baboon.</p>



<h4>Update</h4>



<p>Scientists now investigate Egyptian mummies with advanced imaging devices that were <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/ct-scans-show-first-x-rayed-mummy-new-light">unavailable in 1971</a>. <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/microct-xray-ancient-animal-mummies">Micro-CT scans and virtual reality models</a> have provided detailed life history and embalming information about three animal mummies — a cat, a bird and a snake (<em>SN: 9/12/20, p.&nbsp;17</em>). 3-D printing has enabled scientists to <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/3d-printed-vocal-tract-ancient-mummy-voice-speak-beyond-grave">reconstruct the vocal tract and simulate the voice</a> of a 3,000-year-old mummified priest (<em>SN: 2/15/20, p. 14</em>). And <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/infrared-images-reveal-hidden-tattoos-egyptian-mummies">infrared scanner</a>s have revealed tattoos on seven mummies dating to about 3,000 years ago (<em>SN: 12/21/19 &amp; 1/4/20, p. 8</em>).</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/volcano-eruptions-rainy-period-earth-climate-dinosaur-friendly">A volcano-induced rainy period made Earth’s climate dinosaur-friendly</a></h4>

              
                <p>The biggest beasts to walk the Earth had humble beginnings. The first dinosaurs were cat-sized, lurking in the shadows, just waiting for their moment. That moment came when four major pulses of volcanic activity changed the climate in a geologic blink of an eye, causing a 2-million-year-long rainy spell that coincided with dinos rising to dominance, a new study suggests.</p>



<p>Clues found in sediments buried deep beneath an ancient lake basin in China <a href="https://www.pnas.org/content/118/40/e2109895118">link the volcanic eruptions with climate swings and environmental changes</a> that created a globe-spanning hot and humid oasis in the middle of the hot and dry Triassic Period, researchers report in the Oct. 5 <em>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences</em>. During this geologically brief rainy period 234 million to 232 million years ago, called the Carnian Pluvial Episode, dinosaurs started evolving into the hulking and diverse creatures that would dominate the landscape for the next 166 million years.</p>



<p>Previous research has noted the jump in global temperatures, humidity and rainfall during this time period, as well as a changeover in land and sea life. But these studies lacked detail on what caused these changes, says Jason Hilton, a paleobotanist at the University of Birmingham in England.</p>



<p>So Hilton and his colleagues turned to a several-hundred-meter-long core of lake-bottom sediments drawn from the Jiyuan Basin for answers. The core contained four distinct layers of sediments that included volcanic ash that the team dated to between 234 million and 232 million years ago, matching the timing of the Carnian Pluvial Episode. Within those layers, the team also found mercury, a proxy for volcanic eruptions. “Mercury entered the lake from a mix of atmospheric pollution, volcanic ash and also being washed in from surrounding land that had elevated levels of mercury from volcanism,” Hilton says.</p>

The cores also show evidence of volcanic activity.&nbsp;</span></p></span><span class="credit wp-credit-3104137"><span style="font-family: 'Calibri',sans-serif;color: black">Jing Lu</span></span></figcaption></figure>



<p>Further evidence for the link between volcanism and environmental change during the Carnian Pluvial Episode came from corresponding layers in the core that showed different types of carbon, indicating four massive releases of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. Finally, microfossils and pollens changed within the same core section, from species that prefer drier climates to ones that tend to grow in warm and humid climates.</p>



<p>The reconstructed history suggests that the volcanic pulses injected huge amounts of CO₂ into the atmosphere, says coauthor Jacopo Dal Corso, a geologist at the University of Leeds in England. That boosted temperatures and intensified the hydrologic cycle, enhancing rainfall and increasing runoff into lakes, he says. At the same time, terrestrial plants evolved, with humidity-loving flora becoming predominant. As the rains created wet environments, turtles, large amphibians called metoposaurids — and dinosaurs — began to thrive.</p>



<p>Together, these diverse lines of evidence reveal that the Carnian Pluvial Episode was actually four distinct pulses of significant environmental change — each triggered by massive volcanic eruptions, Dal Corso says.</p>

<p>The mercury and carbon data together suggest the increase in mercury came from a “major source of volcanism that was capable of impacting the global carbon cycle,” rather than local eruptions, the team writes. That volcanism likely came from the Wrangellia Large Igneous Province eruption in what is now British Columbia and Alaska, which has previously, but tenuously, been linked to the Carnian Pluvial Episode. If true, it means the Wrangellia eruption occurred in pulses, rather than one sustained eruption. &nbsp;</p>



<p>This paper marks the “first time that mercury and carbon isotope data are so well correlated across the Carnian Pluvial Episode,” says Andrea Marzoli, an igneous petrologist at the University of Padua in Italy who has studied Wrangellia but was not involved in this research.&nbsp; “The authors make a strong argument in favor of volcanically induced global climate change pulses.” However, Marzoli notes, “the link to Wrangellia is still weak, simply because we don’t know the age of Wrangellia.”</p>







<p>Alastair Ruffell, a forensic geologist at Queen’s University Belfast in Ireland not involved in this study, agrees, saying he’d like to see more evidence of cause and effect between Wrangellia and the environmental changes. This study offers some of the best proxies and data from terrestrial sources to date, but more terrestrial records of the Carnian Pluvial Episode are needed, he says, to “understand what this actually looked like on the ground.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>The climate changes marked a tipping point for life that couldn’t adjust, and those groups went extinct. Animals like dinosaurs and plants like cycads, says Ruffell, were “waiting in the wings” to seize their opportunity. A <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/long-necked-dinosaurs-sauropod-jurassic-herbivores">similar cycle of volcanic activity and environmental change</a> starting about 184 million years ago may have paved the way for the biggest of all dinos, long-necked sauropods, to lumber into dominance (<em>SN: 11/17/20</em>).</p>

              <h4><a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2021/09/30/blind-and-sighted-people-understand-colour-similarly/">Blind And Sighted People Understand Colour Similarly</a></h4>

              
                <p><em>By </em><a href="https://twitter.com/E_Barratt">Emma L. Barratt</a></p>



<p>Colour is generally thought of as something experienced only by those with sight. It’s often assumed that those who’re born blind can learn facts about colours — that a banana is yellow, say — but won’t have the same complex understanding of colour that sighted people have.</p>



<p>But <a href="https://www.pnas.org/content/118/33/e2020192118">new research</a> in <em>PNAS</em> from Judy Kim and colleagues at Johns Hopkins University shows that this is not the case. Instead, the researchers find that blind people have a rich understanding of colour developed through language alone.</p>



<span id="more-43991"></span>



<p>The team looked at different kinds of knowledge about colour in both sighted (N=19) and congenitally blind (N=20) participants. The research was split into three distinct experiments:</p>



<p>The first aimed to probe causal-explanatory and associative memory knowledge of real objects’ colours. Participants were asked to generate common colours for 54 specific objects which were either natural (e.g. strawberry) or artificial. In this latter group, the colour of some objects served a purpose (e.g. stop sign), but for others did not (e.g. book). Participants also indicated whether two of the same objects would be likely to have the same colour.</p>



<p>In experiment two, participants were asked to make inferences about colour consistency in novel natural and artificial objects in an “imaginary island scenario”. Participants were asked to imagine having discovered an undocumented civilisation on a remote island, complete with all that culture’s unknown objects; for example, green “Enly” gems, used for power, and yellow “Kanpa”s, used to spray odorless chemicals in the home. As objects were presented, participants were asked to guess how likely the next such one they come across would be the same colour. This task assessed the extent to which participants believed that objects within the same category (i.e. natural or artificial, with or without functional colour) would also share a colour. These beliefs would indicate that participants were able to build generalisable theories about why objects had certain colours that could be applied more widely.</p>



<p>The final experiment was more open ended; participants were asked to provide explanations as to why particular objects have their colour (eg. “Why is a carrot orange?”), and were able to give any reasons they thought to be correct. This provided further insight into the specifics of both groups’ knowledge about causal mechanisms of colour.</p>



<p>Some findings were consistent with the idea that colour knowledge is acquired through sight. For example, blind people were less likely to agree on associative colour facts; when asked to generate a common colour for a banana, only 50% of blind participants said that bananas were “yellow”, compared to practically all sighted participants. This would suggest that, at least in some cases, directly seeing the colour of an object is more informative than acquiring facts about its colour through other means.</p>



<p>However, both groups agreed more on the likely colour of both natural and artificial objects with functional colours than artificial objects whose colour served no purpose. Both blind and sighted participants also expected two natural objects (e.g. two strawberries), or two artificial objects with functional colours (e.g. two stop signs) to share the same colour, but believed it less likely that two artificial objects whose colour served no purpose (e.g. two books) would have the same colour. Similar findings were observed in the imaginary island scenario, even though neither group had ever seen the novel objects (e.g. “Enly” gems and novel cleaning devices) described in this vignette.</p>



<p>When it came to providing explanations of why object colours differed, the groups were also relatively similar. For natural objects, around a third of sighted and blind participants said that “it just is that way”, and a similar number appealed to processes to explain colouration; for example, describing how photosynthesis makes plants green. When it came to artificial objects without functional colour, both groups commonly explained that colour depended on aesthetic choices (64% vs 44%), or referred to the material from which the object was made (18% vs 13%). And finally, for functionally coloured objects, about half of both groups explained that the colour was the result of cultural convention, and a quarter of both groups said that a specific colour was used to make the object more visibile.</p>



<p>This study wonderfully illustrates that blind and sighted people share common knowledge about colour. Though the two groups differ in some domains — particularly when it comes to associative knowledge about the colour of objects (eg. bananas are yellow) — they are largely similar in their understanding of the natural occurrence and application of colours. Blind individuals are able to draw upon deep understandings of how colours function, and make inferences about totally new objects based on their category alone, in a way that closely resembles those with sight.</p>



<p>The authors take this data to suggest that those living in the same wider societal culture, sighted or blind, develop similar intuitive theories of colour which can be applied to totally novel situations. The source of this knowledge is almost certain to be linguistic, and future research may determine at what ages this framework for colour knowledge develops in both sighted and congenitally blind individuals.</p>

<hr />
<p>Crises can either be transformative or disruptive. The COVID-19 pandemic has unfortunately exposed more of the latter as countries revert to nationalistic tendencies that intensify health inequities. Monitoring from <a href="https://data.undp.org/vaccine-equity/">UNDP data</a> has shown that 1 in 2 people in high-income countries (HICs) have received a shot of the COVID-19 vaccine, while only 1 in 30 have received the same in low-income countries.</p>
<p>Whether between or within countries, health inequity is a major issue requiring global cooperation and strong health systems. The launch of the <a href="https://sdgs.un.org/goals">Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)</a> in 2015 provided an opportunity to demonstrate that global cooperation is possible.</p>
<p>Our research and policy work centers on SDG 3, the goal that seeks to <a href="https://sdgs.un.org/goals/goal3">ensure healthy lives and wellbeing for all</a>. Our research values the idea that a robust ecosystem of <a href="https://ahpsr.who.int/what-we-do/what-is-health-policy-and-systems-research-(hpsr)">Health Policy and Systems Research (HPSR)</a> will contribute to getting countries back on track towards SDG 3 despite the challenges of COVID-19.</p>
<p>In this blog, we showcase an example of our SDG-related work and discuss our reflections from our participation in a convening series from May to June 2021. Around 50 representatives of HPSR institutions across Asia gathered virtually to co-create a vision and action plan for a robust HPSR ecosystem for the region. Asia is a region that has witnessed the emergence of an HPSR landscape that is diverse yet with shared challenges and opportunities. <a href="https://r4d.org/projects/health-systems-strengthening-accelerator/">Results for Development</a> and the <a href="https://ahpsr.who.int/about-us">WHO Alliance for HPSR</a> led the co-creation process with support from <a href="https://www.acceleratehss.org/">USAID and the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation</a>.</p>
<h2><strong>From Push towards Co-creation</strong></h2>
<p>The challenge in using evidence for decision-making was a frequent HPSR issue that emerged in our discussions. The traditional model of evidence translation suggests two worlds: researchers who generate evidence and policymakers who use that evidence. Current approaches based on push models view evidence generation and policymaking as separate processes, where the evidence is pushed for use in policy, as suggested by the phrase evidence-informed policymaking. There is, however, emerging consensus that push or one-way models may even aggravate tensions between researchers and policymakers. Researchers become siloed in research without contributing to policy, while policymakers become siloed in developing policies without drawing on evidence. A co-creation model of doing HPSR, similar to the experience shared by Dr. Gloria Nenita Velasco of the <a href="https://hpdpb.doh.gov.ph/health-research-division/">Philippine Department of Health</a>, can break these siloes down. In this example, the government determines and funds the research agenda while also closely collaborating with HPSR institutions across all stages of the research cycle to address the agenda.</p>

<p>Moving away from push models towards co-creation can ensure broader and meaningful participation of stakeholders. <a href="https://www.usaid.gov/work-usaid/how-to-work-with-usaid/co-creation-usaid">Co-creation</a> is the process of bringing people together to define a problem collectively, identify solutions, and build consensus around action. Drawing on the idea of co-creation, we developed through <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/acceleratorasiaseries/home?authuser=0">a series of virtual sessions</a> the following overarching HPSR vision for Asia: “A stronger enabling HPSR ecosystem of the future that is highly responsive to countries’ needs.”</p>
<figure id="attachment_12548" aria-labelledby="figcaption_attachment_12548" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 518px"><img class="wp-image-12548" src="https://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2021/09/blog-2.png" alt="" width="508" height="285" srcset="https://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2021/09/blog-2.png 1012w, https://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2021/09/blog-2-300x169.png 300w, https://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2021/09/blog-2-768x432.png 768w, https://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2021/09/blog-2-640x360.png 640w" sizes="(max-width: 508px) 100vw, 508px" /><figcaption id="figcaption_attachment_12548" class="wp-caption-text"><div class="attachment-image--caption">The co-created Health Policy and Systems Research vision for Asia had five key components.</div><div class="attachment-image--source"></div></figcaption></figure>
<p>This co-created vision had five key components from which the participants also identified several pathways for success. A common feature of the various pathways was the idea of ensuring co-creation as well within the activities of the HPSR ecosystem. These pathways included secondments or exchanges between HPSR institutions and government agencies to collaborate on policy questions, as well as implementation research, capacity development, and research agenda-setting that bring together government and other stakeholders through networks or other co-creative mechanisms.</p>
<p>A robust HPSR ecosystem contributes to making health systems equitable, resilient in times of crisis, and more responsive to ensure people’s health and wellbeing. Co-creation can help secure buy-in, especially from stakeholders in LMICs who will be instrumental in realizing this vision of a robust HPSR ecosystem. For <a href="https://iigh.unu.edu/">UNU-IIGH,</a> this means building on existing <a href="https://iigh.unu.edu/research/accelerating-the-development-of-health-policy-and-systems-research-hpsr-capacity-in-western-pacific-region-wpr-for-health-system-strengthening.html#outline">collaboration with the Malaysian Ministry of Health</a> and other partners in Asia to sustain HPSR capacity development in the region. Likewise, the vision compels HPSR institutions in the region to co-create the conditions that can set the stage for the effective use of evidence for policies in global health. As we aim for this vision, co-creation will require us to confront the power structures that maintain inequities in health policies and systems and ensure meaningful participation from LMICs and those with marginalized voices.</p>
<h2><strong>Co-creation needs Co-action</strong></h2>
<p>The enabling HPSR vision we have co-created for Asia, the global strategy to beat COVID-19, and the SDGs are all only lofty visions without implementation in practice. Co-action, the process of stakeholders united in moving together to translate their co-created ideas into action, is equally important to sustain the momentum. It remains to be seen if our co-created vision for a robust HPSR ecosystem that supports the achievement of SDG 3 could be attained in 5-10 years. The realization of the vision will require co-action among the stakeholders to fulfill their respective commitments. Co-action among the different players in the HPSR ecosystem can enable health systems to deliver quality health services equitably as routine healthcare services and through emergency response, such as during the COVID-19 pandemic. There are no silver bullets to achieve SDG 3, but co-creation with co-action is one potential pathway if we want to turn the disruption from this crisis into a transformative opportunity which, instead of reversing our gains, moves us even closer to achieve healthy lives and wellbeing for all.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/traumatic-brain-injury-tbi-protein-blood-test-predict-recovery">A blood test may help predict recovery from traumatic brain injury</a></h4>

              
                <p>Elevated blood levels of a specific protein may help scientists predict who has a better chance of bouncing back from a traumatic brain injury.</p>



<p>The protein, called neurofilament light or NfL for short, lends structural support to axons, the tendrils that send messages between brain cells. <a href="http://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/scitranslmed.abg9922">Levels of NfL peak on average at 10 times the typical level 20 days after injury</a> and stay above normal a year later, researchers report September 29 in <em>Science Translational Medicine</em>. The higher the peak NfL blood concentrations after injury, the tougher the recovery for people with TBI six and 12 months later, shows the study of 197 people treated at eight trauma centers across Europe for moderate to severe TBI.</p>



<p>Brain scans of 146 participants revealed that their peak NfL concentrations predicted the extent of brain shrinkage after six months, and axon damage at six and 12 months after injury, neurologist Neil Graham of Imperial College London and his colleagues found.</p>



<p>These researchers also had a unique opportunity to check that the blood biomarker, which gives indirect clues about the brain injury, actually measured what was happening in the brain. In 18 of the participants that needed brain surgery, researchers sampled the fluid surrounding injured neurons. NfL concentrations there correlated with NfL concentrations in the blood.</p>





<p>“The work shows that a new ultrasensitive blood test can be used to accurately diagnose traumatic brain injury,” says Graham. “This blood test can predict quite precisely who’s going to make a good recovery and who’s going to have more difficulties.”</p>



<p>Study participants were adults and mostly male, so more work needs to be done to determine if these findings apply to women, children and people with mild TBI.</p>



<p>Finding a reliable biomarker for the severity and outlook of TBI, a head injury that disrupts brain function, could improve millions of lives. Studies of <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/cte-brain-damage-football-players-top-science-stories-2017-yir">U.S. football players have brought attention</a> to the injury (<em>SN: 12/13/17</em>), but it’s a far more widespread problem. Around 55 million people globally were <a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/laneur/article/PIIS1474-4422(18)30415-0/fulltext">living with a TBI</a> in 2016, and there&#8217;s no one-size-fits-all treatment.</p>



<p>“No two traumatic brain injuries are alike,” says David Okonkwo, director of the Neurotrauma Clinical Trials Center at the University of Pittsburgh. Scientists have been looking for biomarkers of TBI injury such as NfL to develop injury-specific interventions, and Okonkwo says these new findings are promising for patients whose injury has damaged their axons.</p>



<p>“We have not had the tools to measure a specific injury type of an individual patient,” Okonkwo says. While this test probably is still a few years from use in U.S. clinics, other large research groups are looking for ways to use NfL and other blood-based biomarkers for diagnosing TBI and creating opportunities for intervention.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2021/09/29/threat-to-identity-stops-harmful-drinkers-recognising-their-alcohol-issues/">Threat To Identity Stops Harmful Drinkers Recognising Their Alcohol Issues</a></h4>

              
                <p><em>By&nbsp;</em><a href="https://twitter.com/E_Barratt">Emma L. Barratt</a></p>



<p>Here in the UK, one in five hospital admissions is the result of heavy drinking. Those who drink to the extent of needing medical assistance, as well as those who are caused problems by their own alcohol consumption, are known as <em>harmful drinkers</em>. This group is characterised not only by their high levels of alcohol consumption, but a surprisingly low level of problem recognition. Generally speaking, harmful drinkers are known for being resistant to seeing that they have an issue with drinking, often to avoid being labelled as an alcoholic, which comes with a huge amount of stigma. This phenomenon is part of what gave rise to the well-known phrase <em>&#8220;I can stop anytime I want&#8221;.</em></p>



<p>However, this creates a significant barrier to treatment. &#8220;<em>If there’s no problem, what’s there to fix?</em>&#8220;</p>



<p>Researcher James Morris, alongside colleagues from London Southbank University and Northumbria University, believe that this kind of label avoidance is a prime target that psychologists can exploit to increase uptake of treatment in harmful drinkers. Their <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0306460321002781?via%3Dihub">new study</a> in <em>Addictive Behaviors</em> suggests that the solution may be as simple as reframing the issue.</p>



<span id="more-43984"></span>



<p>People often think of drinking issues as binary — you either have one, and by extension are an alcoholic, or you don’t have any issues with alcohol consumption. This kind of binary disease model belief, however, is a simplistic approach. What’s more, the threat to identity posed by such a hard line in the sand leads to a lot of psychological resistance in heavy drinkers, who don’t wish to be saddled with the stigma of being labelled an alcoholic.</p>



<p>However, this isn’t the only way to think about diagnoses. As psychologists, we are familiar with the idea of many diagnoses lying somewhere on a continuum; similarly, alcohol use problems can be seen as lying on a spectrum of severity, as opposed to being divided by a stark cut-off line. Since continuum diagnoses less resemble being labelled, it’s possible that helping individuals hold such a view could lessen their label avoidance, and therefore resistance to problem recognition.</p>



<p>To test this, Morris and colleagues recruited&nbsp;244 harmful drinkers who did not believe they had experience with addiction. Levels of problem recognition in participants were assessed via items from the Stage of Change Readiness and Treatment Eagerness Scale (SOCRATES), which is a questionnaire used to assess problem recognition, ambivalence, and progress towards recovery in those with alcohol consumption issues.</p>



<p>Participants were shown one of six framing messages pertaining to problem drinking. Two of these were based on the continuum model, and illustrated views that all levels of drinking cause some problems, and that there’s no stark cut-off point for having an issue with alcohol consumption. Another two illustrated the binary disease model, emphasising clear differences between those who experience problems with alcohol consumption and those who do not. Two further conditions were controls, which contained prose about governmental approach to alcohol consumption. In each of these categories, one condition contained stigmatising language regarding harmful drinkers, and the other did not.</p>



<p>Overall, the way in which alcohol problems were framed didn’t make a difference: participants who had seen messages based on the continuum or binary disease model showed similar levels of problem recognition. But when this message was considered alongside the presence or absence of stigmatising language, there was an effect. Those who had seen the message that framed alcohol problems in terms of a binary disease model <em>and</em> that included stigmatising language showed significantly lower levels of problem recognition than those who had seen the same framing, but with no stigmatising language. They also showed lower levels of problem recognition than those who had read that alcohol problems were on a continuum. There was no significant difference in problem recognition between those had seen stigmatising or non-stigmatising language within the continuum framing messages group.</p>



<p>The authors interpret the results as showing that alcoholic labelling avoidance was triggered in participants in the binary disease model plus stigmatising language group. They were motivated to deflect this threat to their identity, becoming extra resistant to acknowledging that their harmful drinking may be causing problems, in order to avoid the associated stigma.</p>



<p>This was not a pattern observed for those who read about harmful drinking as a continuum, which suggests that this may be a more effective approach for encouraging those who drink excessively to recognise the impacts it may have on their lives, and subsequently access treatment. By avoiding that hard line in the sand of labelling someone an alcoholic, people are likely to feel less threat to their identity by acknowledging issues they may be having with alcohol consumption, and thus more willing to make changes.</p>



<p>As such, the authors believe that public health messaging embracing a continuum disease model approach which minimises stigmatising language would be most effective in targeting harmful drinkers, and represents a low cost method of improving outcomes in this group.</p>

<p>“Science asks the questions. / And poetry marks the spot.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>This line from “Unweaving Science,” the opening track of the spoken word album <em>Experimental Words</em>, illuminates the connections between science and art. The album, an eclectic collection of 10 poems birthed from collaborations between researchers and spoken word artists, is a celebration of the craft and creativity that drives scientists and poets alike.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The album comes from the minds of coproducers Sam Illingworth and Dan Simpson, themselves embodiments of the bow shock between the two disciplines. Illingworth, who has a Ph.D. in atmospheric physics, is an interdisciplinary researcher at Edinburgh Napier University examining poetry as a science communication tool. Simpson, former poet in residence at Imperial College London, is known for writing poems that are influenced by science.</p>





<p>Illingworth calls <em>Experimental Words</em> a “dance. It’s an experiment.” Every part of the album, from the collaborations to the “<a href="https://experimentalwords.com/videos">music videos</a>” that accompany some of the tracks, evinces the experimentation and exploration that defines both the scientific and creative processes. Even the album cover is experimental, created from an <a href="https://codepen.io/benbennybenben/full/c47bb91deb823f206703ade53bce7e08">interactive algorithm</a> that visualizes the words of the poems. Online, listeners can play around with the algorithm, developed by graphic and web designer Ben Gregory, to create their own versions of the cover.</p>





<p>The album, available on streaming services such as <a href="https://experimentalwords.bandcamp.com/releases">Bandcamp</a>, <a href="https://open.spotify.com/album/4sLT8AMakxGnBnNndErfSG?si=VCcARGXaQquFsCeMBPBAtw&amp;dl_branch=1">Spotify</a>, <a href="https://music.apple.com/us/album/experimental-words/1573981289">Apple Music</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=StoqOvvV0hQ&amp;list=OLAK5uy_k_EQLef6jRpJv5ndkR8PfHR9H1VncK84s">YouTube</a>, aims to shatter the preconception that science and poetry mix like oil and water, Simpson says. “Poets and scientists go out into the world to try to understand it, internalize it and then try and give it back,” he says. “We’re communicators and interpreters and revealers of truth on some level.”</p>



<p>Whether scientist, poet, both or neither, listeners will likely discover some truth in <em>Experimental Words</em> that resonates. The poems have wide-ranging themes, exploring humans’ sometimes-harmonious, sometimes-contentious history with the ocean; the wonders of the universe’s plethora of sounds; the perceptions and realities of artificial intelligence; and the unsung heroism of civil engineers.</p>



<p>Each piece, anchored by its own distinct spoken word style, is colored with unique sounds and music that run the gamut from satellite audio recordings of space to a rendition of a famed 1975 performance by American jazz musician Keith Jarrett.</p>



<p>“Glass Bridge,” for instance, written and recorded by civil and environmental engineer Sunday Popo-Ola of Imperial College London and spoken word artist Malaika Kegode, features an original instrumental piece written by Kegode and her sister, Handina Dutiro. A meditation on the everyday innovations many people take for granted — clean water, well-lit roads, trains, shoes — the poem opens with a challenge: “It is true that we shouldn’t walk on glass. But what if that glass is a bridge, and it is your only way to cross the valley?” A playful percussive motif that evokes a person tinkering with metal tools invites the listener to “meet on that glass bridge / in all its translucent strength / and talk about the invisible, / visible things that keep us alive.”</p>



<p>In “Mechanisms &amp; Multitudes,” a piece about artificial intelligence, computer scientist Ruth Aylett of Heriot-Watt University in Edinburgh and poet Momtaza Mehri play with synthetic and human voices for the poem’s three characters. Daedalus, the mythical Greek architect and craftsman, and PARRY, an early chatbot relic from 1972, don mechanical voices that contrast with the human inflections of <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/idea-makers-tackles-scientific-thinkers-big-ideas-and-personal-lives">Ada Lovelace</a>, widely considered the first computer programmer and who was known for her philosophy of “poetical science” (<em>SN: 8/13/16</em>).</p>



<p><em>Experimental Words</em> features poets and scientists from various personal, artistic and scientific backgrounds. All of the collaborators live in the United Kingdom — which is not surprising since the project originated as a set of live performances there. These roots in the local U.K. sphere left me curious about how the project might evolve in the future, perhaps incorporating more international collaborations or even different media.</p>



<p>Still, the album’s themes are universal. And listeners are dared to “realize that science and poetry are not mutually exclusive entities, but complementary ways of understanding the world in which we live,” Illingworth says.</p>



<p>The album asserts this message on the final track. In “Shapeshifter,” entomologist and science communicator Adam Hart of the University of Gloucestershire in England and poet Desree personify science and art as entities that “carry life, uphill, on their backs / and yet still have to beg for a sustainable rucksack.” The piece, which begins with an argument between the two disciplines about their values to humankind, concludes with the resolution that they are, indeed, one and the same: “I am a shapeshifter / Tell me what you need, / And that, that I’ll be.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/identical-twin-siblings-common-set-chemical-markers-dna-epigenetics">All identical twins may share a common set of chemical markers on their DNA</a></h4>

              
                <p>Identical siblings are used to sharing a lot with their twin, including their DNA. But new research suggests all identical twins share a common signature of twinhood, not in their DNA, but on it.</p>



<p>This signature is part of the epigenome, chemical markers that dot many spots along DNA and influence the activity of genes without altering their sequence. Identical twins everywhere largely <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-021-25583-7">share a specific set of these marks that persists from birth to adulthood</a>, researchers report September 28 in <em>Nature Communications</em>. These shared epigenetic tags could be used to identify people who were conceived as identical twins but lost their sibling in the womb or were separated at birth.</p>



<p>“This paper is absolutely fascinating,” says Nancy Segal, a developmental psychologist at California State University, Fullerton who has researched twins but wasn’t involved in the study. The research sets the groundwork for scientists to better understand “what might cause a fertilized egg to split and form monozygotic [identical] twins,” she says.</p>



<p>Despite humans’ age-old fascination with identical twins, the biological process that generates them, known as monozygotic twinning, “is an enigma,” says Jenny van Dongen, an epigeneticist at Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam.</p>





<p>Researchers know that identical twins form after a fertilized egg, called a zygote, somehow splits into two embryos during development. But why this cleavage happens remains unknown, van Dongen says. For the most part, identical twins don’t run in families, and they occur at roughly the same rate worldwide — about 3 to 4 per 1,000 births. With no clear genetic or environmental cause, the prevailing hypothesis is that identical twins arise at random, she says.</p>



<p>Early development, for twins and non-twins alike, happens amid a flurry of epigenetic changes that turn many genes on or off as an embryo takes shape. Some of these <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/study-shows-where-identical-twins-part-ways">changes may account for slight differences</a> between identical twins (<em>SN: 7/17/</em><em>12</em>). So to better understand what makes a zygote split to form identical twins, “it makes sense to look at epigenetics,” van Dongen says.</p>



<p>She and colleagues looked for epigenetic differences at over 450,000 sites along the genomes of nearly 6,000 monozygotic twins and dizygotic, or fraternal, twins. Comparing identical twins with fraternal twins, as opposed to comparing twins to non-twins, allowed the researchers to rule out any epigenetic changes that stemmed from the unusual experience of sharing a womb.</p>



<p>At 834 spots along the genome, identical twins were strikingly similar, the researchers found. These shared epigenetic marks were concentrated in certain parts of the genome, including centromere and telomere regions on chromosomes. Some marks were near genes involved in early developmental processes, including those that regulate how tightly cells stick to one another. Whether these differences have health consequences for identical twins is unclear, van Dongen says.</p>



<p>These epigenetic signs popped up in twins young and old, from places as far-flung as Finland to Australia and were found in different cell types. The shared marks are so uniquely common to identical twins that the researchers were able to devise a test that can determine, with up to 80 percent accuracy, whether an individual is an identical twin. That includes individuals who don’t know that they lost their twin during pregnancy, a phenomenon known as vanishing twin syndrome, and twins who were separated at birth.</p>



<p>“This is a very, very important finding that opens up a lot of avenues of inquiry,” says Segal, the developmental psychologist. For example, identical twins are predisposed for a variety of conditions, from left-handedness to certain congenital disorders such as spina bifida, where the spine fails to develop properly. Perhaps, for some portion of people, these conditions stem from being an unknown identical twin, she says.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Whether this epigenetic signature is a cause, consequence or by-product of monozygotic twinning remains unclear, van Dongen says. It’s possible that some of these epigenetic changes tell a zygote to split. Alternatively, these chemical marks could reflect the epigenetic aftermath of the splitting event.</p>



<p>“They could be like a persistent molecular scar of the [splitting] process itself,” says Robert Waterland, an epigeneticist at Baylor College of Medicine in Houston. “An embryo splitting in two pieces would kind of upset things,” he says, and that could disrupt normal epigenetic processes in a way that leaves a permanent mark. He gravitates towards that molecular scar interpretation, though more studies are needed to know for sure, he says.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/~r/plos/Blog/~3/PipwNVEWrvo/">How can publishers better meet the open research needs of funders and institutions?</a></h4>

              
                <!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/loose.dtd">
<html><body><p><strong>Author:</strong> Iain Hrynaszkiewicz, Director, Open Research Solutions</p>



<p><em>Publishers investing in simple solutions in their workflows can help to better meet the needs of funders and institutions who wish to support open research practices, research </em><a href="https://osf.io/z4py9"><em>released this week by PLOS</em></a><em> concludes.</em></p>



<p>Policies can be an effective solution for changing research culture and practice. A growing number of research-performing organisations (institutions) and funding agencies <a href="https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0237464">have policies that support open research practices</a> &mdash; sharing of research data, code and software &mdash; as <a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2020/02/2020-a-turning-point-for-research-data-policy/">do publishers</a>. Seeking to deepen our understanding of funder and institution needs related to open research, we surveyed more than 100 funders and institutions in 2020. We wanted to know if they are evaluating how researchers share data and code, how they are doing it, why they are doing it, and how satisfied they are with their ability to get these tasks done. Our <a href="https://osf.io/z4py9">results are available as a preprint</a> along with <a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.14994498">an anonymised dataset</a>.</p>



<p>Half of respondents had tried to evaluate if researchers are sharing data or code in the past and most plan to do this in the future. The most common reason for assessing data or code sharing was a desire to understand or compare the current state of practices of researchers and the third most common was to inform the development of policies, support or services with the information.<br>However, the approaches being used to assess open research practice appear to be unsatisfactory. Personal contact with researchers, such as via email, was the most common method. One respondent described the task as <em>&ldquo;A very manual process of looking at the individual articles we have funded to see how the data is shared</em>.&rdquo; For organisations that don&rsquo;t &mdash; yet &mdash; have policies on open research, beyond open access to articles, their needs are even less well met. To plan for change, as one respondent from an institution noted, they need better information on how their faculty are currently practicing open research.</p>



<p><img loading="lazy" width="606" height="457" src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/kjx5GyRCanR6AWg0VHrcoDSg1IwRHF9p4nnrsQCH1MUQhYbfHeA-1KXdNZtDTFpft2BC4mAcsEBlCiXa7PHZKtSDKmTmGO4QoDlt_bpebgHWm69zmMNi_QOtV8HFQHYIteIS8fSN=s0"></p>



<p>Overall, the results imply that the growth of policies and requirements for making research data and code available does not appear to be matched with capabilities or solutions for determining if these policies have been complied with. Measuring policy compliance was the second most common reason for evaluating open research practices. Further, there appear to be insufficient tools, or awareness of tools, to support organisations in guiding strategic and policy decisions that could benefit open research.</p>



<p>The issues that seem to be the most challenging for funders and institutions are also the most complex. Determining if research data have been made available <em>in a reusable form</em>, and determining <em>why research data or code have not been shared</em> were among the least satisfied tasks. <a href="https://doi.org/10.31219/osf.io/njr5u">Our previous research</a> suggested researchers also need better solutions for finding research data they can reuse, and obtaining data that are not publicly available.</p>



<p>Another key finding is the limitation of the research paper as the primary mode of research assessment. The evaluation of open research practices associated with specific <em>grants</em>, rather than papers, was even more important to respondents.</p>



<p>However, while evaluating research papers for data and code sharing practices will not tell the whole story of open research, the results do imply that simple solutions implemented by journals and publishers can make some progress towards better meeting some of the needs we assessed in our survey. Many respondents were not satisfied with their ability to complete important tasks that relate to finding information in publications.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Simple solutions more publishers could provide include:</p>



<ul><li><strong>Mandatory Data Availability Statements (DAS) in all relevant publications</strong>.<br>Across the STM industry <a href="https://dashboard.stm-assoc.org/">around 15% of papers</a> include a DAS. Since we introduced our data availability policy in 2014, 100% of PLOS research articles include a DAS.</li><li><strong>Supporting researchers to provide information on why research data (and code) are <em>not</em> publicly available with their publications</strong>.<br><a href="https://bmjopen.bmj.com/content/6/10/e011784">Time</a> <a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2775667">and</a> <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-021-00981-0">again</a> &ldquo;data available on request&rdquo; has been shown to be ineffective at supporting new research &mdash; and is not permitted in PLOS journals.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Enabling and encouraging the use of data repositories.</strong><br>Recommending the use of data repositories is a useful step, but making them easily and freely accessible &mdash; integrated into the publishing process &mdash; can be even more effective. Rates of repository use are higher in journals that partner closely with repositories and remove cost barriers to their use.</li><li><strong>Providing visible links to research data on publications</strong>.Many researchers also struggle to find data they can reuse, hence PLOS will <a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2021/09/wellcome-trust-awards-plos-a-grant-to-test-ways-to-increase-sharing-and-discovery-of-research-data">soon be experimenting</a> with improving this functionality in our articles, and integrating the Dryad repository with submission.</li></ul>



<p>For many researchers, to whom we know compliance with funder policies is important, publishing work in a way, or in journals, that support transparency in the availability of research data and code will be helpful in meeting their funders&rsquo; and institutions&rsquo; needs &mdash; as well as supporting reuse and impact of their research.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/transparent-ink-printer-butterflies-color-spectrum-microscale-pattern">These colorful butterflies were created using transparent ink</a></h4>

              
                <p>You’ve heard of disappearing ink. Now get ready for suddenly appearing ink. Using a clear liquid, researchers can print a full rainbow of colors on transparent surfaces. The trick is printing the liquid in precise, microscale patterns that create structural color.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/sunbirds-feathers-iridescence-heat-light">Structural colors</a> arise from the way different wavelengths of light bounce off <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/butterfly-inspired-nanostructures-can-sort-light">microscopic imperfections</a> on surfaces (<em>SN: 8/17/21; SN: 6/1/16</em>). “In nature, there are many beautiful structure colors, such as the wings of butterflies, the feathers of peacocks, the skin of chameleons and so on,” says Yanlin Song, a materials chemist at the Chinese Academy of Sciences in Beijing.</p>



<p>Song and colleagues printed structural colors on transparent silicone sheets using an ordinary ink-jet printer and clear polymer ink. The printer studded the silicone sheets with millions of microscopic ink domes, each of which served as a single pixel in the resulting image. Adjusting the size of a microdome <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/oil-water-droplets-glow-vibrant-colors">changed the wavelengths of light that the dome reflected</a> and therefore its color (<em>SN: 3/8/19</em>). Increasing the width of a single dome from 6.6 to 11 micrometers <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.abh1992">shifted its hue</a> along the spectrum from blue to red and back again, the researchers report online September 22 in <em>Science Advances</em>.</p>



<p>The denser the domes were packed, the brighter the image. And printing a medley of differently colored ink pixels across a single area created blended shades, such as brown and gray. Using the technique, Song’s team printed multicolor, photorealistic portraits of Isaac Newton, Marilyn Monroe and other famous figures.</p>

<p>“I was excited to see that somebody had used [structural color] for this purpose,” says Lauren Zarzar, a materials chemist at Penn State who has studied similar structural colors cast by water and oil droplets. “They had some nice examples that I think illustrated the versatility of this mechanism.”</p>



<p>Zarzar imagines using structural colors to create complex optical signatures for anti-counterfeiting features on ID cards or currency. Such shimmery, colorfast hues could also make useful materials for cosmetics, clothing or architecture, she says.</p>

                <p><em>By</em> <a href="https://emmayoung.net/">Emma Young</a></p>



<p>The world is full of migrants — not only refugees from places like Afghanistan and Syria, but also people who have travelled to study, or to work in another country. In fact, 281 million people live outside their country of birth or citizenship. They face all kinds of challenges, and adapting well to life in a new culture is a critical one.</p>



<p>Current thinking holds that what an immigrant <em>does</em> is important for how well they adapt both psychologically and socially. A combination of maintaining one’s own culture while also engaging in the mainstream culture is widely held to be the best strategy. This idea, known as integration or biculturalism, has informed advice and also policy-making. But a <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/09567976211006432">major study</a> in <em>Psychological Science</em> now argues that it is wrong. In fact, report Kinga Bierwiaczonek and Jonas Kunst at the University of Oslo, there is only “miniscule” evidence that any culture-oriented strategy adopted by an immigrant affects how well they adapt. As the pair writes, with some understatement: “In a world in which virtually every modern society is culturally diverse, our findings have considerable implications.”</p>



<span id="more-43943"></span>



<p>Psychologists have identified four &#8220;acculturation styles&#8221;: integration, assimilation (which entails giving up the heritage culture), separation (maintaining the heritage culture and not adopting aspects of the new culture) and marginalisation (neither maintaining the heritage culture nor adopting the mainstream culture).</p>



<p>The idea that integration is best dates back to the early 1990s. In 1997, John Berry, then at the universities of Bergen and Oxford, wrote a <a href="https://iaap-journals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1464-0597.1997.tb01087.x">highly influential paper</a> in which he concluded that psychological and sociocultural adaptation “are usually predicted by the successful pursuit of the integration acculturation strategy.”</p>



<p>However, the vast majority of studies supporting this idea are correlational, write Bierwiaczonek and Kunst. This leaves open the possibility that there could be other explanations — perhaps, for example, it’s more cognitively challenging to maintain aspects of one’s own culture while also adopting aspects of the new one, and more cognitively able immigrants also adapt better.</p>



<p>The pair also has concerns about the way some of the data has been analysed. An <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0022022111435097">influential meta-analysis of mostly these correlational studies</a>, which supported the integration hypothesis, used a statistical approach that Bierwiaczonek and Kunst feel could allow for misinterpretations.</p>



<p>When they re-analysed these 83 studies, on a total of more than 23,000 participants, they reached a different conclusion: “acculturation has a very limited association with adaptation”.</p>



<p>The pair then conducted a meta-analysis of 19 exclusively longitudinal studies on just under 7,000 people. (This included children and adolescents as well as adults who had moved to countries such as the UK, US, Germany, Hong Kong and Finland.) Because these studies included measures of acculturation and also adaptation (such as symptoms of depression, mood, school performance and social relationships) over time, they should in theory provide a clearer picture of any links between a strategy and adaptation. Bierwiaczonek and Kunst’s analysis did reveal some effects of acculturation strategy on adaptation — but they were “inconsistent and approached zero.” In other words, no helpful conclusions could be drawn from them.</p>



<p>Bierwiaczonek and Kunst argue that it might be better for policy-makers and support organisations to look to other factors known to influence an immigrant’s wellbeing, such as discrimination in the community, language barriers and social support. As they point out, “This generally puts more of the burden of successful adaptation on the receiving societies than on migrants themselves.”</p>



<p>The findings have implications for future research in this area, too. They suggest that further correlational studies would be of little help. “The field of acculturation should move on to primarily relying on investigations that utilize experiments as well as rigorous longitudinal methods,” Bierwiaczonek and Kunst argue. Given that the wellbeing of millions of people — including many vulnerable children and adults — is at stake, surely this can’t come too soon.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/~r/plos/Blog/~3/xWOpNz-h49Q/">Announcing a new PLOS policy on inclusion in global research</a></h4>

              
                <!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/loose.dtd">
<html><body><p><a href="https://plos.org/about/">PLOS</a> empowers researchers to accelerate progress in science and medicine by leading a transformation in research communication. We push the boundaries of &ldquo;open&rdquo; to create a more equitable system of scientific knowledge and understanding.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Today, we are taking further steps to bring equity to publishing by launching a new policy to improve transparency in the reporting of research that is conducted in other countries or communities. Some global research has been criticised as being &ldquo;parachute research&rdquo; also known as &ldquo;helicopter&rdquo; or &ldquo;neo-colonial science&rdquo;. This occurs when researchers travel to under-resourced communities, conduct their research, and leave, often with little or poor understanding or involvement of the communities they studied, and few direct benefits to local participants.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/s/best-practices-in-research-reporting">policy</a>, implemented across all PLOS journals, aims to improve reporting of global research. Authors conducting research of this nature may be asked to complete a questionnaire that outlines ethical, cultural, and scientific considerations specific to inclusivity in global research. The questionnaire also asks authors conducting research without local authors why none have been included on the authorship list. A reminder of the <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/s/authorship">PLOS criteria for authorship</a> is also included, which states that all individuals who meet these criteria should be included in the author byline, rather than in the acknowledgements.</p>



<p>The information collected in the questionnaire will be made available to editors and reviewers during the peer review process to help assess whether the research meets the journal&rsquo;s standards for the ethics of experimentation and research integrity. The completed questionnaire will also be included as a Supporting Information file with the published paper, improving transparency in global research.</p>



<p>PLOS publishes research in over 200 disciplines and we recognise that expectations for conducting research may vary between fields. As such, at the time of launch, we won&rsquo;t have specific requirements for global research practices, beyond our existing <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/s/human-subjects-research">policies</a>. Instead, we&rsquo;ll work with our community of reviewers and editorial board members to consider questions that arise from the policy on a case-by-case basis. We hope the policy will improve awareness of the concerns related to global research, laying foundations for future development of additional policies in this area.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/s/best-practices-in-research-reporting">policy</a> has been developed in close collaboration with members of the research community across the globe, including researchers from South Africa, New Zealand, the USA, and Kenya. This has included individuals from multiple research areas, including population health, genetics, biological sciences and paleontology. We&rsquo;re incredibly grateful for their valuable input in developing the policy.</p>



<p>To celebrate the launch of the new policy, some of the individuals involved in its development recently participated in a discussion with the title &lsquo;Inclusion in global science: Preventing &lsquo;parachute research&rsquo;. The panel discussed how parachute research is an offshoot of academic narcissism and the result of pervasive views that &lsquo;<em>we know best&rsquo;</em>, &lsquo;<em>we are the experts</em>&rsquo; and &lsquo;<em>we will tell you the solutions</em>&rsquo;. They further discussed the role for publishers, institutions and funders in preventing parachute research, before noting the importance of capacity building and local ownership of research programs in low- and middle-income countries.

Taking NSAIDs during the first trimester is known to increase the risk of miscarriage (SN: 11/5/11, p. 14). In 2020, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration warned that people who are 20 weeks or more into a pregnancy should avoid using NSAIDs altogether because the drugs can cause rare but serious kidney problems as well as heart problems for fetuses. However, exceptions can be made for pregnant people at risk of preeclampsia (SN: 7/13/91, p. 22), clotting and preterm delivery. In such cases, the FDA recommends that doctors prescribe the lowest effective dose of aspirin.">pregnant people at risk of preeclampsia</a> (<em>SN: 7/13/91, p. 22</em>), clotting and preterm delivery.

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/oldest-fossil-evidence-amber-spider-mom-care-young">This is the oldest fossil evidence of spider moms taking care of their young</a></h4>

              
                <p>Long before <em>Tyrannosaurus rex</em> walked the Earth, sap engulfed a spider guarding her egg sac.</p>



<p>Her corpse, preserved alongside her offspring in amber for 99 million years, is the oldest physical evidence for maternal care in spiders, says Paul Selden, an invertebrate paleontologist at the University of Kansas in Lawrence. This fossil is one of four showing that <a href="https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rspb.2021.1279">some ancient spiders guarded their egg sacs and may even have raised their young</a>, Seldon and his colleagues report September 15 in <em>Proceedings of the Royal Society B</em>.</p>



<p>Maternal care, such as guarding eggs, is common among modern spiders. Some species even go so far as <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/jumping-spider-mom-nurses-her-brood-weeks-milk">nursing their young</a> (<em>SN: 10/29/18</em>) or serving themselves up as <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/when-mom-serves-herself-dinner">their children’s first meal</a> (<em>SN: 4/21/15</em>). Because maternal care is so widespread, researchers suspected that spiders developed this behavior long before the Cretaceous Period, which began around 145 million years ago.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But this “is the first time we’ve seen evidence for this behavior in fossils,” says Selden. The female spider and her unborn offspring belong to a now-extinct family of spiders called Lagonomegopidae, distinguished by their large, reflective eyes. She and her kin would probably have hunted in trees at night.</p>



<p>Along with guarding their eggs, female spiders may have stuck around after the eggs hatched. Three of the chunks of amber contain dozens of week-old spiders. Spiders are usually solitary creatures, so the presence of multiple spiderlings side-by-side suggests that they didn’t disperse after birth, choosing instead to stay alongside their mother. </p>

<p>How long these spiders stuck around mom remains unclear. While the study “unequivocally” shows that these spiders were guarding their egg sacs during the mid-Cretaceous, “future researchers need to keep their eyes open for females with larger and older offspring,” says Linda Rayor, an entomologist at Cornell University who studies maternal care in spiders.</p>



<p>Researchers will have to look for further fossil evidence in existing museum and institutional collections. Some paleontologists are <a href="https://vertpaleo.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/SVP-Letter-to-paleontological-community-on-Myanmar-Amber_FINAL.pdf">calling for a moratorium on publishing research on amber from Myanmar</a> mined after 2017 over concerns of inhumane conditions in mines and worries that the sale of amber was funding militant groups, a situation further exacerbated by the military coup in 2021. The pieces of amber used in this study are part of a pre-existing collection at the Capital Normal University in Beijing and were mined over a decade ago.</p>



<p>That moratorium shouldn’t hinder future discoveries, Selden says. “There are already thousands of specimens — and more material than there are people available to study it.”</p>

                <p><em>By&nbsp;</em><a href="http://emilyoliviareynolds.com/">Emily Reynolds</a></p>



<p>It can be hard to know what’s going to go viral — or even what’s going to get you just a few more likes. For many, however, expressing an outraged opinion on politics has been a good way of garnering interactions, even if it doesn’t <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2019/11/13/the-paradox-of-viral-outrage-public-shaming-inspires-further-outrage-but-also-increases-sympathy-for-the-offender/">always have the intended effect</a>.</p>



<p>A <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.abe5641">new study</a>, published in <em>Science Advances</em> and authored by William Brady and colleagues from Yale University, looks more closely at how outrage spreads on social media. It finds that likes and shares&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;garnered by outrage act as a reward that &#8220;teaches&#8221; us to express more of the same.</p>



<span id="more-43939"></span>



<p>The team first trained a machine learning algorithm to classify tweets by whether or not they expressed outrage. The algorithm was trained on 26,000 tweets collected after a variety of incidents that sparked widespread outrage in the United States, such as the confirmation of Brett Kavanaugh and the Trump administration’s ban on transgender people in the military; some of these tweets contained outrage and some didn’t. The incidents were chosen because of their hypothesised resonance with different groups of people on the political spectrum; one, an incident showing an angry woman being ejected from a United Airlines flight, was non-political in nature.</p>



<p>Once trained, the algorithm was then used to analyse the entire tweet history of 7,331 Twitter users who had posted about these incidents, totalling around 12.7 million tweets. The team also gathered information on positive social feedback — i.e. likes and retweets — both in relation to outrage-specific posts and non-outraged posts. They also looked at the political ideology of both the poster themselves and their friendship network.</p>



<p>The results showed that people were more likely to express outrage if they had received more likes and retweets for an expression of outrage the previous day. In real terms, this meant that if someone received 100% more positive feedback than average for an outraged tweet, they were 2 to 3% more likely to show outrage the next day. This effect was, however, weaker for those who had been tweeting for a longer time, suggesting people become desensitised to this feedback over time.</p>



<p>As you might expect, those with stronger ideological leanings and who belonged to networks of similarly ideological people were more likely to express outrage on a political topic that pushed their buttons. However, while they showed more outrage overall, those who belonged to more extreme networks were less likely to respond to social feedback — that is, those with moderate political networks were more likely to adjust their behaviour in response to likes and shares on outraged posts. Expressions of outrage, then, are based not only on norms — e.g. what others are saying — but on reinforcement behaviours too.</p>



<p>In the next part of the study, participants engaged with a platform designed to simulate Twitter, viewing 12 posts commenting on contentious topics — Trump, Medicare for All, US immigration policy, and Extinction Rebellion. In the outrage condition, 75% of the tweets seen by participants expressed outrage, while participants in the neutral condition saw no outrage at all. The amount of positive feedback varied underneath each post, with those in the outrage condition seeing a higher number of likes and shares on the outraged posts.</p>



<p>After scrolling through the tweets, participants completed a learning task, in which they had to share content&nbsp;with the end goal of maximising likes and shares. Participants were presented with two tweets discussing the same political topics, one containing outrage and one neutral, and indicated which they wanted to share. They were immediately given feedback on their choice, with outrage posts on average getting more shares and likes.</p>



<p>Again, both norms and reinforcement impacted how often participants expressed outrage. Those in the outrage condition, who had seen more outraged posts to begin with, were more likely to select an outraged tweet than a neutral one in the learning stage, while those in the neutral condition were more likely to select a neutral tweet. But participants in both conditions were also impacted by reinforcement, selecting more outraged posts over time as they got feedback on their choices (though the effect of this was weaker in those who had primarily seen neutral posts).</p>



<p>So, overall, social feedback in the form of likes and shares &#8220;teach&#8221; people to express more outrage. While we may be more likely to express outrage if our friends or followers also do, through norm learning, those with moderate political networks are particularly sensitive to reinforcement via likes and shares.</p>



<p>“Amplification of moral outrage is a clear consequence of social media’s business model, which optimizes for user engagement,” <a href="https://news.yale.edu/2021/08/13/likes-and-shares-teach-people-express-more-outrage-online">says</a> senior author Molly Crockett. “Given that moral outrage plays a crucial role in social and political change, we should be aware that tech companies have the ability to influence the success or failure of collective movements.”</p>

<p><a href="https://bookshop.org/a/21798/9780691229003">Ice Rivers</a><br><em>Jemma Wadham<br>Princeton Univ., $26.95</em></p>



<p>I’ve always been a sucker for glacier lingo, whimsical words for a harsh landscape gouged, smoothed and bulldozed by ice. Moulins, drumlins, eskers and moraines. Cirques and arêtes. Cold katabatic winds blowing down a mountain, huffed from a glacier’s snout and said to be its spirit.</p>



<p>Jemma Wadham’s <em>Ice Rivers: A Story of Glaciers, Wilderness, and Humanity</em> leans into this duality of whimsy and harshness, cheerfully pulling readers into this strange, icy world. Wadham, a glaciologist at the University of Bristol in England, confesses that her goal is to give readers a sense of connection to glaciers, which she knowingly anthropomorphizes: In her writing, glaciers have heavy bodies, dirty snouts and veins filled with water.</p>





<p>“When I’m with them, I feel like I’m among friends,” she writes. “It is, in many ways, a love story.” And knowing the glaciers, she reasons — perhaps coming to love them — is key to trying to save them.</p>





<p>Accordingly, the book’s chapters are anchored by site, and each chapter documents a different field expedition or series of expeditions to a particular glacier. Wadham takes us from the Swiss Alps to Norway’s Svalbard islands, from India’s Himalayas to Antarctica’s McMurdo Dry Valleys. It’s a breezy read, with an eager party host vibe (“let me introduce to you my friend the glacier; I think you two will get along”).</p>



<p>While describing each site, Wadham dives into an engaging mishmash of personal recollections about her fieldwork, snippets of accessible glacier and climate science (I now know that these rivers of ice have three different manners of flow), a dash of alpine and polar exploration history, and many bits of local color. <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/otzi-mummy-ate-high-fat-meal-before-death">Ötzi the 5,300-year-old iceman</a>, Erik the Red, Svalbard’s many polar bears and wild Patagonian horses all make an appearance, not to mention the mummified corpses of seals and penguins littering the Dry Valleys (<em>SN: 7/12/18</em>).</p>



<p>An interesting thread winding through the book concerns how the focus of glaciology as a field has shifted through time. After several years of not winning grants that would allow her to continue working on Svalbard, in 2008 Wadham got the opportunity to go to Greenland instead. “Valley glaciers were no longer considered quite as cutting-edge to the research council funders,” she writes. “Instead, glaciologists had become obsessed with the vast ice sheets,” for the potential of their meltwaters to raise sea levels and alter ocean currents. Several years later, funders began to call for projects looking at melting glaciers’ impacts on ocean life and the water cycle, opening up an opportunity for Wadham to study Patagonia’s fast-changing glacial region.</p>



<p>Where the book really comes alive is in its vivid snapshots of a scientist’s life in the field: making a bleary-eyed cup of coffee in Patagonia using a thin sock as a filter; fearfully skittering across fragile fjord ice on a Ski-Doo; consuming tins of bland <em>fiskeboller</em>, or fish balls, which were mostly used for food but sometimes for rifle practice; solo dancing away a gray mood on a pebbly beach on Svalbard, with a rifle ready to repel polar bears resting nearby on the stones.</p>



<p>These recollections are honest, funny and poignant, and reveal how the highs and lows of fieldwork are inextricably intertwined. Wadham writes, for example, of dreading the “hollow feeling caused by constant sleep deprivation” due to the midnight sun and the relentless roaring of winds and water, a feeling tempered by her fierce love for the open expanses of the wild and for pursuing a “big mission.”</p>



<p>She also writes wistfully of the “communal mirth of field-camp life” where she had never laughed as much before and, less wistfully, of the heavy, claustrophobic atmosphere of an Antarctic research station with its supercharged heating system and extreme politeness over meals with strangers. Against the backdrop of Patagonia’s swiftly shrinking glaciers, Wadham comes to grips with difficult personal losses, even as she wrestles with mysterious headaches. Months later, while recovering from emergency brain surgery, she secretly begins to write about her glaciers. Still more months pass before she finds her way back to the ice, this time in the Peruvian Andes.</p>



<p>“I quickly realized one key thing about fieldwork — if you think you are there to work, you’re gravely mistaken,” Wadham writes. “You’re actually there to survive, and perform some research along the way — if you’re lucky.… In some ways I found all this ‘surviving’ a grounding process.” </p>



<p>Every glacier Wadham has studied has shrunk since she first set foot on the ice over a quarter century ago. But <em>Ice Rivers</em> isn’t focused on mourning those glaciers so much as on celebrating the peace and purpose — the grounding line — Wadham found in them.

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/rice-agriculture-feeds-world-climate-change-drought-flood-risk">Rice feeds half the world. Climate change’s droughts and floods put it at risk</a></h4>

              
                <p class="has-drop-cap" style="font-size:20px">Under a midday summer sun in California’s Sacramento Valley, rice farmer Peter Rystrom walks across a dusty, barren plot of land, parched soil crunching beneath each step.</p>



<p>In a typical year, he’d be sloshing through inches of water amid lush, green rice plants. But today the soil lies naked and baking in the 35˚ Celsius (95˚ Fahrenheit) heat during a devastating drought that has hit most of the western United States. The drought started in early 2020, and conditions have become progressively drier.</p>



<p>Low water levels in reservoirs and rivers have forced farmers like Rystrom, whose family has been growing rice on this land for four generations, to slash their water use.</p>



<p>Rystrom stops and looks around. “We’ve had to cut back between 25 and 50 percent.” He’s relatively lucky. In some parts of the Sacramento Valley, depending on water rights, he says, farmers received no water this season.</p>





<p>California is the second-largest U.S. producer of rice, after Arkansas, and over 95 percent of California’s rice is grown within about 160 kilometers of Sacramento. To the city’s east rise the peaks of the Sierra Nevada, which means “snowy mountains” in Spanish. Rice growers in the valley below count on the range to live up to its name each winter. In spring, melting snowpack flows into rivers and reservoirs, and then through an intricate network of canals and drainages to rice fields that farmers irrigate in a shallow inundation from April or May to September or October.</p>



<p>If too little snow falls in those mountains, farmers like Rystrom are forced to leave fields unplanted. On April 1 this year, the date when California’s snowpack is usually at its deepest, it held about 40 percent less water than average, according to the California Department of Water Resources. On August 4, Lake Oroville, which supplies Rystrom and other local rice farmers with irrigation water, was at its lowest level on record.</p>

Ogasa</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>Not too long ago, the opposite — too much rain — stopped Rystrom and others from planting. “In 2017 and 2019, we were leaving ground out because of flood. We couldn’t plant,” he says. Tractors couldn’t move through the muddy, clay-rich soil to prepare the fields for seeding.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41558-018-0140-y">Climate change is expected to worsen</a> the state’s extreme swings in precipitation, researchers reported in 2018 in <em>Nature Climate Change</em>. This “climate whiplash” looms over Rystrom and the other 2,500 or so rice producers in the Golden State. “They’re talking about less and less snowpack, and more concentrated bursts of rain,” Rystrom says. “It’s really concerning.”</p>



<p>Farmers in China, India, Bangladesh, Indonesia, Vietnam — the biggest rice-growing countries — as well as in Nigeria, Africa’s largest rice producer — also worry about the damage climate change will do to rice production. More than 3.5 billion people get 20 percent or more of their calories from the fluffy grains. And demand is increasing in Asia, Latin America and especially in Africa.</p>



<p>To save and even boost production, rice growers, engineers and researchers have turned to water-saving irrigation routines and rice gene banks that store hundreds of thousands of varieties ready to be distributed or bred into new, climate-resilient forms. With climate change accelerating, and researchers raising the alarm about related threats, such as arsenic contamination and bacterial diseases, the demand for innovation grows.</p>



<p>“If we lose our rice crop, we’re not going to be eating,” says plant geneticist Pamela Ronald of the University of California, Davis. Climate change is already threatening rice-growing regions around the world, says Ronald, who identifies genes in rice that help the plant withstand disease and floods. “This is not a future problem. This is happening now.”</p>

<h3>The top rice producers are in Asia</h3>



<p>The world’s top rice producer is China, at 214 million metric tons. India, Bangladesh, Indonesia and Vietnam are next. In Africa, Nigeria (6.8 million) is the largest producer. Brazil (11.8 million) and the United States (10.2 million) are also top producers, according to 2018 data from the U.N. Food and Agriculture Organization.</p>

<h4>Saltwater woes</h4>



<p>Most rice plants are grown in fields, or paddies, that are typically filled with around 10 centimeters of water. This constant, shallow inundation helps stave off weeds and pests. But if water levels suddenly get too high, such as during a flash flood, the rice plants can die.</p>



<p>Striking the right balance between too much and too little water can be a struggle for many rice farmers, especially in Asia, where over 90 percent of the world’s rice is produced. Large river deltas in South and Southeast Asia, such as the Mekong River Delta in Vietnam, offer flat, fertile land that is ideal for farming rice. But these low-lying areas are sensitive to swings in the water cycle. And because deltas sit on the coast, drought brings another threat: salt.</p>



<p>Salt’s impact is glaringly apparent in the Mekong River Delta. When the river runs low, saltwater from the South China Sea encroaches upstream into the delta, where it can creep into the soils and irrigation canals of the delta’s rice fields.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full is-style-default"><img loading="lazy" width="1030" height="685" src="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/092521_rice_inline_saltwater.jpg" alt="a farmer's hand holding dead rice plants being pulled from a paddy" class="wp-image-3103849" srcset="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/092521_rice_inline_saltwater.jpg 1030w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/092521_rice_inline_saltwater-576x383.jpg 576w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/092521_rice_inline_saltwater-677x450.jpg 677w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/092521_rice_inline_saltwater-280x186.jpg 280w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/092521_rice_inline_saltwater-768x511.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/092521_rice_inline_saltwater-872x580.jpg 872w" sizes="(max-width: 1030px) 100vw, 1030px" /><figcaption><span class="caption wp-caption-3103849">In Vietnam’s Mekong River Delta, farmers pull dead rice plants from a paddy that was contaminated by saltwater intrusion from the South China Sea, which can happen during a drought.</span><span class="credit wp-credit-3103849">HOANG DINH NAM/AFP VIA GETTY IMAGES</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>“If you irrigate rice with water that’s too salty, especially at certain [growing] stages, you are at risk of losing 100 percent of the crop,” says Bjoern Sander, a climate change specialist at the International Rice Research Institute, or IRRI, who is based in Vietnam.</p>



<p>In a 2015 and 2016 drought, saltwater reached up to 90 kilometers inland, destroying 405,000 hectares of rice paddies. In 2019 and 2020, drought and saltwater intrusion returned, damaging 58,000 hectares of rice. With regional temperatures on the rise, these conditions in Southeast Asia are <a href="https://www.unescap.org/publications/ready-dry-years-building-resilience-drought-south-east-asia-2nd-edition">expected to intensify and become more widespread</a>, according to a 2020 report by the Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific.</p>



<p>Then comes the whiplash: Each year from around April to October, the summer monsoon turns on the faucet over swaths of South and Southeast Asia. About 80 percent of South Asia’s rainfall is dumped during this season and can cause destructive flash floods.</p>



<p>Bangladesh is one of the most flood-prone rice producers in the region, as it sits at the mouths of the Ganges, Brahmaputra and Meghna rivers. In June 2020, monsoon rains flooded about 37 percent of the country, damaging about 83,000 hectares of rice fields, according to Bangladesh’s Ministry of Agriculture. And the future holds little relief; <a href="https://advances.sciencemag.org/content/7/23/eabg3848">South Asia’s monsoon rainfall is expected to intensify with climate change</a>, researchers reported June 4 in <em>Science Advances</em>.</p>





<h4>A hot mess</h4>



<p>Water highs and lows aren’t the entire story. Rice generally grows best in places with hot days and cooler nights. But in many rice-growing regions, temperatures are getting too hot. Rice plants become most vulnerable to heat stress during the middle phase of their growth, before they begin building up the meat in their grains. Extreme heat, above 35˚ C, can diminish grain counts in just weeks, or even days. In April in Bangladesh, two consecutive days of 36˚ C destroyed thousands of hectares of rice.</p>



<p>In South and Southeast Asia, <a href="https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/2021EF001992?af=R">such extreme heat events are expected to become common</a> with climate change, researchers reported in July in <em>Earth’s Future</em>. And there are other, less obvious, consequences for rice in a warming world.</p>



<p>One of the greatest threats is bacterial blight, a fatal plant disease caused by the bacterium <em>Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae</em>. The disease, most prevalent in Southeast Asia and rising in Africa, has been reported to have cut rice yields by up to 70 percent in a single season.</p>



<p>“We know that with higher temperature, the disease becomes worse,” says Jan Leach, a plant pathologist at Colorado State University in Fort Collins. Most of the genes that help rice combat bacterial blight seem to become less effective when temperatures rise, she explains.</p>



<p>And as the world warms, new frontiers may open for rice pathogens. An August study in <em>Nature Climate Change</em> suggests that as global temperatures rise, rice plants (and many other crops) at northern latitudes, such as those in China and the United States, <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41558-021-01104-8#Sec19">will be at higher risk of pathogen infection</a>.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, rising temperatures may bring a double-edged arsenic problem. In a 2019 study in <em>Nature Communications</em>, E. Marie Muehe, a biogeochemist at the Helmholtz Centre for Environmental Research in Leipzig, Germany, who was then at Stanford University, showed that <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-019-12946-4">under future climate conditions, more arsenic will infiltrate rice plants</a>. High arsenic levels boost the health risk of eating the rice and impair plant growth.</p>

<h3>Leaching in</h3>



<p>When grown in a greenhouse at 5 degrees Celsius above preindustrial temperatures with elevated carbon dioxide levels (representing a future climate), California rice varieties absorbed more of a type of highly toxic arsenic from the soil, raising the rice’s arsenic levels above European Union safety thresholds.</p>



<h6 class="has-text-align-center">Arsenic levels in rice grains</h6>

<p>Arsenic naturally occurs in soils, though in most regions the toxic element is present at very low levels. Rice, however, is particularly susceptible to arsenic contamination, because it is grown in flooded conditions. Paddy soils lack oxygen, and the microbes that thrive in this anoxic environment liberate arsenic from the soil. Once the arsenic is in the water, rice plants can draw it in through their roots. From there, the element is distributed throughout the plants’ tissues and grains.</p>



<p>Muehe and her team grew a Californian variety of rice in a local low-arsenic soil inside climate-controlled greenhouses. Increasing the temperature and carbon dioxide levels to match future climate scenarios enhanced the activity of the microbes living in the rice paddy soils and increased the amount of arsenic in the grains, Muehe says. And importantly, rice yields diminished. In the low-arsenic Californian soil under future climate conditions, rice yield dropped 16 percent.</p>



<p>According to the researchers, models that forecast the future production of rice don’t account for the impact of arsenic on harvest yields. What that means, Muehe says, is that current projections are overestimating how much rice will be produced in the future.</p>



<h4>Managing rice’s thirst</h4>



<p>From atop an embankment that edges one of his fields, Rystrom watches water gush from a pipe, flooding a paddy packed with rice plants. “On a year like this, we decided to pump,” he says.</p>



<p>Able to tap into groundwater, Rystrom left only about 10 percent of his fields unplanted this growing season. “If everybody was pumping from the ground to farm rice every year,” he admits, it would be unsustainable.</p>



<p>One widely studied, drought-friendly method is “alternate wetting and drying,” or intermittent flooding, which involves flooding and draining rice paddies on one- to 10-day cycles, as opposed to maintaining a constant inundation. This practice can cut water use by up to 38 percent without sacrificing yields. It also stabilizes the soil for harvesting and lowers arsenic levels in rice by bringing more oxygen into the soils, disrupting the arsenic-releasing microbes. If tuned just right, it may even slightly improve crop yields.</p>



<p>But the water-saving benefits of this method are greatest when it is used on highly permeable soils, such as those in Arkansas and other parts of the U.S. South, which normally require lots of water to keep flooded, says Bruce Linquist, a rice specialist at the University of California Cooperative Extension. The Sacramento Valley’s clay-rich soils don’t drain well, so the water savings where Rystrom farms are minimal; he doesn’t use the method.</p>



<p>Building embankments, canal systems and reservoirs can also help farmers dampen the volatility of the water cycle. But for some, the solution to rice’s climate-related problems lies in enhancing the plant itself.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" width="1030" height="671" src="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/092521_rice_inline_rystrom.jpg" alt="three men stand next to each other" class="wp-image-3103848" srcset="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/092521_rice_inline_rystrom.jpg 1030w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/092521_rice_inline_rystrom-588x383.jpg 588w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/092521_rice_inline_rystrom-691x450.jpg 691w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/092521_rice_inline_rystrom-286x186.jpg 286w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/092521_rice_inline_rystrom-768x500.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/092521_rice_inline_rystrom-890x580.jpg 890w" sizes="(max-width: 1030px) 100vw, 1030px" /><figcaption><span class="caption wp-caption-3103848">Fourth-generation rice farmer Peter Rystrom (left) stands with his grandfather Don Rystrom (middle) and his father Steve Rystrom (right).</span><span class="credit wp-credit-3103848">CALIFORNIA RICE COMMISSION, BRIAN BAER</span></figcaption></figure>



<h4>Better breeds</h4>



<p>The world’s largest collection of rice is stored near the southern rim of Laguna de Bay in the Philippines, in the city of Los Baños. There, the International Rice Genebank, managed by IRRI, holds over 132,000 varieties of rice seeds from farms around the globe.</p>



<p>Upon arrival in Los Baños, those seeds are dried and processed, placed in paper bags and moved into two storage facilities — one cooled to 2˚ to 4˚ C from which seeds can be readily withdrawn, and another chilled to –20˚ C for long-term storage. To be extra safe, backup seeds are kept at the National Center for Genetic Resources Preservation in Fort Collins, Colo., and the Svalbard Global Seed Vault tucked inside a mountain in Norway.</p>



<p>All this is done to protect the biodiversity of rice and amass a trove of genetic material that can be used to breed future generations of rice. Farmers no longer use many of the stored varieties, instead opting for new higher-yield or sturdier breeds. Nevertheless, solutions to climate-related problems may be hidden in the DNA of those older strains. “Scientists are always looking through that collection to see if genes can be discovered that aren’t being used right now,” says Ronald, of UC Davis. “That’s how <em>Sub1</em> was discovered.”</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full is-style-default"><img loading="lazy" width="1030" height="684" src="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/092521_rice_inline_genebank.jpg" alt="two people in blue jumpsuits looking at rice seeds on shelves" class="wp-image-3103845" srcset="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/092521_rice_inline_genebank.jpg 1030w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/092521_rice_inline_genebank-577x383.jpg 577w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/092521_rice_inline_genebank-678x450.jpg 678w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/092521_rice_inline_genebank-280x186.jpg 280w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/092521_rice_inline_genebank-768x510.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/092521_rice_inline_genebank-873x580.jpg 873w" sizes="(max-width: 1030px) 100vw, 1030px" /><figcaption><span class="caption wp-caption-3103845">Over 132,000 varieties of rice seeds fill the shelves of the climate-controlled International Rice Genebank.

<p>The <em>Sub1</em> gene enables rice plants to endure prolonged periods completely submerged underwater. It was discovered in 1996 in a traditional variety of rice grown in the Indian state of Orissa, and through breeding has been incorporated into varieties cultivated in flood-prone regions of South and Southeast Asia. <em>Sub1</em>-wielding varieties, called “scuba rice,” can survive for over two weeks entirely submerged, a boon for farmers whose fields are vulnerable to flash floods.</p>



<p>Some researchers are looking beyond the genetic variability preserved in rice gene banks, searching instead for useful genes from other species, including plants and bacteria. But inserting genes from one species into another, or genetic modification, remains controversial. The most famous example of genetically modified rice is Golden Rice, which was intended as a partial solution to childhood malnutrition. Golden Rice grains are enriched in beta-carotene, a precursor to vitamin A. To create the rice, researchers spliced a gene from a daffodil and another from a bacterium into an Asian variety of rice.</p>



<p>Three decades have passed since its initial development, and only a handful of countries have deemed Golden Rice safe for consumption. On July 23, the Philippines became the first country to approve the commercial production of Golden Rice. Abdelbagi Ismail, principal scientist at IRRI, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/gmos-havent-delivered-their-promises-or-risks">blames the slow acceptance on public perception and commercial interests opposed to genetically modified organisms</a>, or GMOs (<em>SN: 2/6/16, p. 22</em>).</p>



<p>Looking ahead, it will be crucial for countries to embrace GM rice, Ismail says. Developing nations, particularly those in Africa that are becoming more dependent on the crop, would benefit greatly from the technology, which could produce new varieties faster than breeding and may allow researchers to incorporate traits into rice plants that conventional breeding cannot. If Golden Rice were to gain worldwide acceptance, it could open the door for new genetically modified climate- and disease-resilient varieties, Ismail says. “It will take time,” he says. “But it will happen.”</p>



<p>Climate change is a many-headed beast, and each rice-growing region will face its own particular set of problems. Solving those problems will require collaboration between local farmers, government officials and the international community of researchers.</p>



<p>“I want my kids to be able to have a shot at this,” Rystrom says. “You have to do a lot more than just farm rice. You have to think generations ahead.”</p>



<div class="wp-block-sciencenews-content-sidebar">
<h4>Climate-resilient rice</h4>



<p>To keep rice bowls around the world full, researchers breed new varieties of rice that can endure stresses like drought, floods and salt.</p>



<p><strong>Sahbhagi Dhan</strong>: Traditional rice varieties take 120 to 150 days to harvest and require four irrigations. Sahbhagi Dhan is a drought-tolerant variety harvested after 105 days and just two irrigations. In normal conditions, it produces about twice as much rice (four to five metric tons per hectare) as other local varieties in India. Under drought conditions, it produces one to two metric tons per hectare; local varieties produce none.</p>

<p><strong>Scuba rice</strong>: <em>Sub1</em>, a submergence-tolerance gene, has been bred into scuba rice varieties. Rice normally dies after three to four days of total submergence — many varieties will exhaust themselves to death trying to quickly grow to the water’s surface. <em>Sub1</em> varieties (shown), however, refrain from this frenzied growth spurt, and can withstand over two weeks underwater, able to survive the sudden floods of the summer monsoon.</p>



<p><strong>Salt-tolerant rice</strong>: Made by inserting an area of the genome called Saltol, salt-tolerant rice varieties are better able to regulate the amount of sodium ions, toxic in high amounts, in their tissues. Saltol has been incorporated into high-yield varieties throughout the world.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/vampire-bats-drink-blood-friends-strangers-social">Bloodthirsty vampire bats like to drink with friends over strangers</a></h4>

              
                <p>Vampire bats may be bloodthirsty, but that doesn’t mean they can’t share a drink with friends.</p>



<p>Fights can erupt among bats over gushing wounds bit into unsuspecting animals. But bats that have bonded while roosting <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pbio.3001366">often team up to drink blood</a> away from home, researchers report September 23 in <em>PLOS Biology</em>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Vampire bats (<em>Desmodus rotundus</em>) can <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/vampire-bat-friendships-endure-captivity-wild">form long-term social bonds</a> with each other through grooming, sharing regurgitated blood meals and generally hanging out together at the roost (<em>SN: 10/31/19</em>). But whether these friendships, which occur between both kin and nonkin, extend to the bats’ nightly hunting had been unclear. “They’re flying around out there, but we didn’t know if they were still interacting with each other,” says Gerald Carter, an evolutionary biologist at Ohio State University in Columbus.</p>



<p>To find out, Carter and his colleague Simon Ripperger of the Museum für Naturkunde in Berlin, built on <a href="https://www.cell.com/current-biology/fulltext/S0960-9822(19)31364-8">previous research</a> that uncovered a colony’s social network using bat backpacks. Tiny computer sensors glued to 50 female bats in Tolé, Panama, continuously registered proximity to other sensors both within the roost and outside, revealing when bats met up while foraging.&nbsp;</p>

</div><figcaption>Two common vampire bats feed on a cow near La Chorrera, Panama. It can take 10 to 40 minutes for a bat to bite a small, diamond-shaped wound into an animal’s flesh, and fights can sometimes break out over access to wounds. But researchers found that bats who are friendly back at the roost likely feed together in the field, potentially saving time and energy.</figcaption></figure>



<p>Bat buds rarely left the roost together, suggesting that they don’t go on tightly coordinated hunts, Carter says. But bats with a history of associating with one another were more likely than strangers to meet up in the field and likely feed together, the researchers found. Rendezvous with friends also lasted longer, on average, than other interactions. That was especially true for bats with many roost buddies.</p>



<p>“These are more or less haphazard encounters,” Carter says. He suspects that the bats mostly forage alone, but when they encounter a friendly bat on a cow, for instance, they’ll feed together instead of fighting or flying off to find other food. Biting a new wound can take 10 to 40 minutes, Carter says, so sharing with a friend could save these bloodthirsty bats time and energy.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/footprints-ghost-tracks-prehistoric-humans-americas">‘Ghost tracks’ suggest people came to the Americas earlier than once thought</a></h4>

              
                <p>Footprints left behind by prehistoric people may be some of the strongest evidence yet that humans arrived in the Americas earlier than previously thought. &nbsp;</p>



<p>Over 60 “ghost tracks” — so-called because they pop up and disappear across the landscape — show that people romped through what’s now New Mexico 23,000 to 21,000 years ago, geoscientist Matthew Bennett and colleagues report in the Sept. 24 <em>Science</em>. If true, the fossil findings would be definitive proof that <a href="http://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.abg7586">humans were in North America during the height of the last ice age, </a>which peaked around 21,500 years ago.</p>



<p>When people first arrived in the Americas is highly contested. Scientists have historically thought that humans traveled across the Bering land bridge that connected Asia to North America around 13,000 years ago, after <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/younger-dryas-comet-impact-cold-snap">the massive Laurentide Ice Sheet</a> that once blanketed much of North America had started retreating into the Arctic (<em>SN: 6/26/18</em>). But a slew of more recent discoveries from across North and South America — including roughly <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/americas-ancient-people-arrival-mexico-coxcatlan-cave">30,000-year-old animal bones from a Mexican cave</a> (<em>SN: 6/9/21</em>) and <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/texas-toolmakers-add-debate-over-who-first-americans-were">stone tools</a> from Texas (<em>SN: 7/11/18</em>) — suggest that humans may have arrived far earlier.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>At White Sands National Park in New Mexico, Bennett, of Bournemouth University in Poole, England, and colleagues used several methods to calculate the ages of the newly described tracks, including radiocarbon dating of aquatic plants embedded in and between the footprints.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>





<p>“One of the beautiful things about footprints is that, unlike stone tools or bones, they can’t be moved up or down the stratigraphy,” he says. “They’re fixed, and they’re very precise.”</p>



<p>But some archaeologists aren’t yet convinced of the footprints’ ages. Loren Davis, an anthropologist at Oregon State University in Corvallis, says that he would like to see the researchers use other validation techniques to check the dates before “breaking out the champagne.”</p>



<p>“This is the kind of stuff that makes you rewrite textbooks,” Davis says. “For the good of the field, we need really high standards.” But if further verification confirms the age of the tracks, he says the discovery will “show us that people have this amazing ability to survive and thrive during a time when global conditions were extreme.”</p>



<p>The tracks were created over two millennia mostly by children and teenagers wandering through the patchwork of waterways that defined the White Sands area during the Ice Age, the researchers say. The footprints were found alongside those of mammoths, giant ground sloths and other megafauna that flocked to water in the largely arid landscape.</p>



<p>Bennett is planning on returning to White Sands after the pandemic to continue studying human footprints, hoping to learn more about the people who made them. “Footprints have a way of connecting you to the past that’s like nothing else,” he says. “It’s very powerful to put your finger in the base of a track and know that someone walked that way 23,000 years ago.”</p>

<p><strong>PCM:</strong>&nbsp;I got involved with HERI after they advertised for their Advancing&nbsp;Womxn PhD fellowship post.&nbsp;With the help of&nbsp;<a href="http://www.archaeology.uct.ac.za/age/faculty-and-staff/jayne-wilkins" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dr. Jayne Wilkins</a>, I applied, and I got the funding.&nbsp;Before I applied, I had met&nbsp;<a href="http://www.geology.uct.ac.za/robyn/pickering" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dr. Robyn Pickering</a>&nbsp;working in the field.&nbsp;We were both part of the group that was excavating and researching in&#8239;Tswalu&#8239;(as part of the&nbsp;North of&#8239;Kuruman&#8239;project&nbsp;in the Northern Cape of South Africa);&nbsp;she was blown away by my passion for Middle Stone Age archaeology and dedication to excavating very hard ancient lake deposits. She advised me to apply for the Advancing&nbsp;Womxn fellowship and this is how I become part of the HERI team.&#8239;&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>RK:&nbsp;</strong>I think my story with HERI is a little unorthodox in that I only found about it early last year. After my Masters, I took&nbsp;my first&nbsp;six month&nbsp;hiatus from academics since 1998!&nbsp;So, when I decided to go back to school, I needed an academic home. I also needed a change after getting all my other qualifications from the same institution. So, on one fateful January evening last year, after drafting an email for what now seems like days, I hit the &ldquo;Send&rdquo; button, said a quick prayer and hoped for the best. In this email, I was introducing myself and asking&nbsp;Dr.&nbsp;Robyn Pickering to be my academic supervisor. Coincidentally, she was also looking for a new student to take up space and be an&nbsp;Advancing&nbsp;Womxn&nbsp;Fellow and that is how my journey with HERI started. So, I guess&nbsp;HERI&nbsp;and I found each other, and the rest, as they say, is&nbsp;history.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>MM:</strong> At&nbsp;the end of 2020, in line with their mission, HERI advertised two postdoctoral fellowships seeking African researchers under their Carnegie DEAL fellowships and I applied for&nbsp;one of the positions&nbsp;relating to reconstructing past climates to work with Dr. Robyn Pickering. I officially joined HERI in June 2021.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>PLOS:</strong>&nbsp;<strong>What does your&nbsp;own&nbsp;research entail?</strong>&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>SB:&nbsp;</strong>My research project examines the highly dynamic social practices through which communities around archaeological heritage sites become exposed (and influenced) in their everyday life to the influx of travelers, heritage experts, tourists, curators, and most importantly for this study, international scientists, not least archaeologists, and&nbsp;paleo-anthropologists. This cosmopolitan group is involved in, and benefits from the construction of heritage and science narratives for diverse reasons and interests.&nbsp;My research interrogates the historical influences of sciences and heritage program narratives in archaeology including examining who owns, constructs, and controls the narratives and who does not and why.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>PCM:</strong>&nbsp;My research is entitled<em>; Early human social transmission during MIS 5: A perspective from the Kalahari Basin</em>. This research focuses on social transmission in the Kalahari Basin during the Marine Isotope Stage (MIS) 5, dated 130-74 ka, a key period for understanding the emergence and expansion of modern humans. I am studying and comparing MIS 5 lithic assemblages from multiple sites within the Kalahari Basin, employing and building upon Tostevin&rsquo;s (2012) cultural transmission approach. The main MIS 5 samples understudy comprise those at Ga-Mohana, Kathu Pan,&#8239;Wonderwerk, Bundu,&#8239;Erfkroon, and&#8239;Florisbad&#8239;in South Africa, #Gi and White Paintings in Botswana. My research is against the background that humans have been passing on information from one group to the other;&nbsp;thus,&nbsp;I use stone artifacts to help piece together a fuller picture of how early humans emerged, expanded, and shared information over time in the Kalahari Basin.&#8239;The research&nbsp;aims to produce a detailed account of the MIS 5 lithic technology in this region, thus shedding light on the degree and nature of social interaction in the Kalahari, and&nbsp;it&nbsp;works&nbsp;toward correcting the geographic bias toward coastal regions in southern Africa.&#8239;&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>RK:&nbsp;</strong>My research focuses on using the only accelerator mass spectrometer in Africa and the&nbsp;Southern&nbsp;Hemisphere to understand southern African landscape evolution. I use cosmogenic nuclides,&nbsp;<sup>10</sup>Be and&nbsp;<sup>26</sup>Al to understand the rates of erosion along mixed-bedrock alluvial&nbsp;anabranching&nbsp;rivers in South Africa. Understanding how these rivers have eroded&nbsp;will allow us to understand how they have developed. This will also inform how these rivers have contributed to those who have lived nearby&nbsp;and relied on them over the years.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>MM:&nbsp;</strong>My new research project will investigate vegetation and climate dynamics over the last approx. 250,000 years in South Africa&rsquo;s interior using phytolith analysis&nbsp;that is, microscopic&nbsp;plant silica remains that will be&nbsp;extracted&nbsp;in the laboratory from sediment cores obtained from the&nbsp;Kalkkop&nbsp;Crater in the Eastern Cape.&nbsp;My current&nbsp;research focuses on work that is part of multidisciplinary projects at various archaeological sites in South Africa where I apply the same technique to investigate early human-plant and -environmental interactions to understand the type of plants they&nbsp;utilized, their&nbsp;behavior,&nbsp;and surrounding vegetation and climate and how these might also have influenced their&nbsp;behavior.&nbsp;I therefore mainly seek to provide a past environmental context to&nbsp;studies that study early human behavior and their cultures.&nbsp;I also have a keen interest&nbsp;in improving&nbsp;the dentification&nbsp;and interpretation of phytoliths in ancient sediments. Researchers achieve&nbsp;this by studying phytoliths produced in modern&nbsp;plants and the&nbsp;soils&nbsp;under them.&nbsp;In that regard, a lot of my research also focuses on&nbsp;studying&nbsp;phytoliths in modern&nbsp;South African plant types&nbsp;mainly grasses, sedges and trees/shrubs.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>PLOS:&nbsp;HERI encompasses a wide range of scientific disciplines &ndash; from&nbsp;palaeoscience&nbsp;to anthropology.&nbsp;Do you think this interdisciplinary approach provides opportunities for more comprehensive and collaborative research?</strong>&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>SB:&nbsp;</strong>This is one of the many strengths within HERI, because diversity in research promotes better science and opportunities for diverse and multidisciplinary teams for comprehensive understanding of human origins.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>PCM: </strong>Yes,&#8239;this interdisciplinary approach is good, and it provides collaborative research.&#8239;An interdisciplinary concept/ approach involves crossing various scientific disciplines or fields and integrating different ideas into cohesive thoughts so that we work in unison to accomplish a common goal.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>RK:</strong>&nbsp;Absolutely! This is something that more institutions and science in general really need to invest in. So much more can be&nbsp;answered&nbsp;and new questions can be asked from an interdisciplinary approach. From just spending time (in these virtual times) with other students at HERI and engaging in&nbsp;#AcademicTwitter&nbsp;over the last 18 or so months, I have come to learn so much about other people&rsquo;s work and there always seems&nbsp;to be a link between disciplines that can be identified and that is evidence of how more comprehensive and collaborative research can be.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>MM:</strong>&nbsp;Certainly. For one, most research teams are now focusing on using various disciplines to answer the questions they have because often one discipline or a single proxy cannot provide all the answers. In my experience with such institutes,&nbsp;one gains immense general knowledge from the various disciplines involved&nbsp;and the&nbsp;ability to&nbsp;think&nbsp;beyond&nbsp;one&rsquo;s field&nbsp;for&nbsp;research&nbsp;questions&nbsp;and potential&nbsp;collaborations.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>PLOS:&nbsp;As part of the Advancing Womxn program, the HERI Fellows receive field training and mentorship &ndash; how has this made a difference in your career? Why do you think that these kinds of opportunities for women in traditionally male-led research areas are important?</strong>&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>SB:</strong> Mentorship in traditionally male led research areas is important in grooming young female researchers to thrive in careers in academia,&nbsp;which promotes diversity in research questions and therefore better scientific research results.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>PCM: </strong>I am yet to participate in any HERI field trip (because I am still new). But so far, I have received mentorships through HERI winter series that are held&nbsp;online&nbsp;beginning of every month. These winter series have helped me intensely in my&nbsp;carrier&nbsp;especially the one that had to do with mental health in academia.&nbsp;This was a good talk given the background that most of us have suffered the mental effects that have been brought by the pandemic.&nbsp; We have also been advised on how to manage stress in these stressful pandemic times. These kinds of opportunities are important especially to us as women because studies have shown that women are more likely than men to have a great deal of stress.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>RK:</strong>&nbsp;Unfortunately, I joined HERI just before the national lockdown started, so I did not get to be involved in,&nbsp;nor have I participated in,&nbsp;any field training as such. However, I do have prior field training from my studies over the years and HERI has also introduced me to the women-only field excursion,&nbsp;which I think is an incredible initiative&nbsp;that&nbsp;I really hope I can participate in one day. I think it is so important to have initiatives such as these because who better to understand challenges faced by women than women? I believe the excursion workshop creates a safe space for women to be open about the different challenges that we experience in the spaces we are in.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>MM:&nbsp;</strong>Our first field work was cancelled when South Africa went into another lockdown,&nbsp;but I look forward to the field experiences and programs at HERI especially those that present new dimensions from my previous experiences. To answer the last part of your question, I would simply ask why would we even need to explain their importance? Opportunities for women in these disciplines should be a given in the 21<sup>st</sup>&nbsp;Century so these fields need to catch up! Before getting into the&nbsp;palaeosciences&nbsp;in South Africa, I don&rsquo;t think that I had ever conceptualised &ldquo;male-dominated&rdquo; fields in&nbsp;this&nbsp;sense. My lecturers in Biology and Chemistry where both men and women with PhDs so gender is not something I quickly saw as a limiting factor until I switched disciplines or countries so to speak &ndash; to a discipline that is rare in my country and yet common in South Africa. I did not imagine that women interested in these field should have to deal with misgivings based on their gender and race but alas the atmosphere and its&nbsp;issues can be palpable and are lived experiences for many who in turn&nbsp;are tasked with explaining&nbsp;&lsquo;the why&rsquo;.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>PLOS:&nbsp;HERI researchers often challenge the traditional narratives that govern our understanding of human evolution. What new things have you learned&nbsp;as part of your work with the institute that have surprised you?</strong>&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>SB:&nbsp;</strong>As HERI drives African-led research on human evolution, the institute also provides a conducive environment for female researchers to inspire and mentor one another, producing greater appreciation of human evolution research from a minority group within a male-led discipline and diversifying the voices that construct narratives of the African Past. I am from the background of&nbsp;Humanities and&nbsp;Social&nbsp;Sciences, but I have never felt out of place in HERI. I gain much from the interdisciplinary exchange that also strengthens my own research with an awareness of a wide range of lenses and many levels in human origins&nbsp;research.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>PCM: </strong>I am still yet to learn new things;&nbsp;However,&nbsp;HERI challenges traditional narratives in human evolution. Some of HERI&rsquo;s research in the interior &ldquo;Kalahari basin&rdquo; led by Dr Jayne Wilkins&nbsp;developed&nbsp;theories that say our&nbsp;ancestors&nbsp;evolved behaviors are seen as &lsquo;modern&rsquo; at&nbsp;about 100 thousand years ago along the coast&nbsp;are&nbsp;too simplistic. The research provides&nbsp;valuable insights into the evolution of modern human behavior in the interior South Africa, thus diverting from the traditional narratives that behaviors were seen as &lsquo;modern&rsquo; at about 100ka along the coastal regions.&#8239;Women are drastically under-represented in&nbsp;palaeo-sciences (archaeology and human evolution). Women in science are working in a male dominated field and they have been fighting for equality for a long time.&nbsp;Although the situation seems to have improved,&nbsp;the struggle to be part of editorial boards or get leadership position still rages on, thus I applaud the HERI advancing womxn fellowship&nbsp;programme&nbsp;for empowering black women and giving us an opportunity to rise and shine.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>RK: </strong>My work at HERI fits well into the change that HERI strives to bring in science as it aims to challenge&nbsp;the&nbsp;Southern Africa landscape evolution narratives. It was so refreshing to find that so many HERI students and fellows are challenging narratives through their work. I think the one thing that has really stood out for me at HERI is how involved they are in the development and progress of their students. At previous institutions, I never used to meet in a group with other students for status update meetings or student-supervisor one on one meetings as frequently as we do at HERI. It is&nbsp;really new&nbsp;and different,&nbsp;but I really appreciate it as it promotes accountability and allows you to also see your progress. I wish others would adopt this because it is so important to share the journey as it can be quite taxing, both physically and emotionally.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>MM:&nbsp;</strong>I would say my surprise with HERI came&nbsp;early on in&nbsp;the&nbsp;discoveries made during my&nbsp;application&nbsp;and&nbsp;also&nbsp;from&nbsp;before from their presence on social media&nbsp;&ndash; to&nbsp;see two white women spearheading the discussions about these traditional narratives and questioning them. For me, this was a first in general&nbsp;in the several years I have lived in South Africa.&nbsp;It has always baffled me to begin with that it is the &lsquo;minority&rsquo; in these fields always in the thick of these discussions and fighting to be heard. Otherwise,&nbsp;I am certain there will be a lot of learning&nbsp;in regards to&nbsp;the&nbsp;results of the&nbsp;human evolution research&nbsp;being conducted by researchers and students&nbsp;at HERI&nbsp;that investigate those narratives.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>PLOS:&nbsp;Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, some of you have not yet had an opportunity to begin&nbsp;your fieldwork. For those of you who have,&nbsp;tell us about one of your&nbsp;memorable&nbsp;field campaigns or an aspect of field training you loved (or hated!).</strong>&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>RK:&nbsp;</strong>I have had some field experience and as I finish typing this, I am on my way back to Johannesburg from one in the Kruger National Park working towards my PhD qualification. I think this may have been my most memorable field experience yet. Growing up, my family was always fond of visits to the&nbsp;park&nbsp;and I was always okay with it because we always stayed in the car. This&nbsp;particular experience&nbsp;came with me having to get out of the car and walk along a major river, in the wild! That was a literally wild and interesting experience for me, one I am sure to never forget. I conquered real fears out&nbsp;there&nbsp;but I am&nbsp;really proud&nbsp;of myself for showing up.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>SB:</strong>&nbsp;It is challenging to conduct field work among human participants&nbsp;in the midst of&nbsp;the&nbsp;Covid-19 pandemic. I am currently conducting field work in a community that depended on the revenue from international tourists&nbsp;in Botswana. Witnessing the impact of the pandemic in this community is an uncomfortable experience. I have also been confronted with situations&nbsp;where, during&nbsp;first&nbsp;few days of field&nbsp;work&nbsp;people told me what they thought I wanted to hear&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;conversations/interview responses seemed guarded and defensive.&nbsp;However, after spending an extended amount of time&nbsp;in the field, researcher-participant relations&nbsp;slightly fade into&nbsp;more of&nbsp;a social space encounter than an &ldquo;academic/ insider-outsider binary&rdquo;. I love this about the field.&#8239;&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>PCM:</strong> I am yet to participate in any HERI field trip. This is because of the pandemic. I would wish to participate in future HERI fieldworks and field camps, because these are women&rsquo;s field camps and they are free of the hierarchy, and women&rsquo;s harassment and actual sexual assaults. Women&rsquo;s field camps also give an opportunity to engage and learn more about other women and share our different experiences in the science field. HERI field camps also prepare women for how to deal with issues of harassment in the science field and ensure their safety.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>PLOS:&nbsp;Archaeology and anthropology have been historically vulnerable&nbsp;to &lsquo;parachute research&rsquo;, where researchers from other nations arrive at a country of interest and conduct research without consulting or&nbsp;crediting&nbsp;any of the local population. Have you ever seen or heard of researchers doing this, and how do you think programs like HERI help to address this important issue?</strong>&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>SB:&nbsp;</strong>In addressing the question of parachute research, part of my project investigates the outcomes within the public sphere, of the recent publication by Chan et al (2019) entitled &ldquo;Human origins in a southern African paleo-wetland and first migrations&rdquo;. The authors infer that &lsquo;anatomically modern humans&rsquo; originated in the Makgadikgadi&ndash;Okavango&nbsp;palaeo-wetland of southern Africa around 200 thousand years ago.&#8239;The study used maternal mitochondrial DNA data as&nbsp;a&nbsp;proxy for populations,&nbsp;and&nbsp;the results locate a southern African &ldquo;Homeland&rdquo; in the residual Makgadikgadi-Okavango wetlands. Contrary to these claims, hominin fossil data from across Africa show the presence of characteristics of Homo sapiens more than 300 thousand years ago at the opposite end of the continent (Hublin&nbsp;2017). In&nbsp;addition, recent works in&nbsp;palaeoanthropology&nbsp;indicate that the evolution of Homo sapiens primitive features is found across time and space, and this data does not indicate a single point of origin. This study produced questionable results, lacked diversity, and ignored the recent work of scholars in the region,&nbsp;which misrepresented the science of human origins in Africa,&nbsp;yet had access to high profile and extensive media coverage and a broader dissemination of data which attracted the attention of varied interest groups. This paper echoes a status quo in Southern Africa in which no authority is given to the scientific observations or interpretive models developed by scholars from the region. The authority remains exclusively in the hands of western and foreign scientists. HERI offers a platform that makes room for local and marginalized voices.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>PCM: </strong>I think in Archaeology this is a thing of the past now. HERI and other disciplines in Archaeology are trying&nbsp;by all means to&nbsp;de-colonise&nbsp;Archaeology and this is another aspect that is improving. Scholars now give credit to the local communities, and this is important.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>RK:</strong>&nbsp;This has not been any different in Geology, where I am registered. I am almost confident in thinking that &ldquo;parachute research&rdquo; is a science-wide&nbsp;issue. Personally, I feel proud of being a part of an institute such as HERI which exposed me to the Advancing&nbsp;Womxn&nbsp;Fellowship, which supports African-led research about Africa, in Africa by empowering black women in science. This is a big contributing factor towards challenging &ldquo;parachute research&rdquo; as it equips African researchers with resources to do their science boldly.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>MM:</strong>&nbsp;Yes,&nbsp;I have seen it&nbsp;and also&nbsp;heard of it as a lived experience for many&nbsp;colleagues from various disciplines&nbsp;researchers and it is a general problem for research in Africa&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;not just Archaeology and Anthropology. It has led to various platforms raising concern about &lsquo;research for whom&rsquo; and concepts of&nbsp;&lsquo;neo-colonialism&rsquo;. HERI emphasises African-led research and&nbsp;its&nbsp;stance on&nbsp;colonial&nbsp;practices is clear,&nbsp;but I believe it will ultimately be up to African researchers and especially their governments to put an end to this practice by&nbsp;changing&nbsp;how research practices operate on the continent.&nbsp;As far as I know this&nbsp;local&nbsp;involvement is&nbsp;not a&nbsp;requirement for research permits&nbsp;in South&nbsp;Africa&nbsp;unlike in&nbsp;East&nbsp;African countries&nbsp;although this&nbsp;has not&nbsp;necessarily&nbsp;changed&nbsp;the&nbsp;narrative.&nbsp;I&nbsp;have&nbsp;recently&nbsp;seen&nbsp;adverts&nbsp;calling for researchers to apply for funding and&nbsp;they categorically&nbsp;stated&nbsp;that those&nbsp;with their &ldquo;parachute&rdquo; approach need not apply.&nbsp;Clearly,&nbsp;the funders&nbsp;are now&nbsp;questioning&nbsp;the&nbsp;practice.&nbsp;This will likely&nbsp;force a&nbsp;change in this&nbsp;practice&nbsp;but not&nbsp;a&nbsp;real&nbsp;interest in&nbsp;ending the&nbsp;practice.&nbsp;I&nbsp;think&nbsp;that&nbsp;individual&nbsp;African researchers&nbsp;should&nbsp;be accountable for their role in&nbsp;encouraging it.&nbsp;Can you imagine the hoops and loops African researchers would have to jump if for some reason they think&nbsp;of&nbsp;and want to excavate an archaeological site&nbsp;or&nbsp;take&nbsp;sediment cores from&nbsp;a lake&nbsp;in&nbsp;say&nbsp;Europe and&nbsp;carry&nbsp;the&nbsp;material&nbsp;back to&nbsp;Africa?&nbsp;I&nbsp;am assuming here that they are jumpable to start with.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>PLOS:&nbsp;PLOS is a champion of &ldquo;Open Science&rdquo;. This includes not only open access to&nbsp;scientific&nbsp;publications, but Open Data,&nbsp;code sharing,&nbsp;transparent peer-review, etc. How do you think Open Science&nbsp;can&nbsp;benefit your research field?&nbsp;How can it benefit your community?</strong>&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>SB:&nbsp;</strong>With the current climate of the Covid-19 pandemic and reduced physical contact, I believe as researchers we benefit from platforms that open the research discussions beyond physical contact and promote continuous feedback outside of physical contact through workshops and conferences.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>PCM:</strong> Open science can benefit my research because it will&nbsp;publicise&nbsp;my work such that it becomes available to whomever may need it.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>RK:&nbsp;</strong>There are a few things that stand out for me about &ldquo;Open Science&rdquo;; exposure and accessibility, reproducibility and building. I cannot count the number of times I have tried to find articles or journals only to get access to just an abstract. This seems to me like a block towards building the scientific body of knowledge and education in general. Open Science can benefit more than just my field of research and community because it will expose the future generation, who are curious about science and building their futures, and are already de-motivated&nbsp;by&nbsp;how difficult it must be if access to information is already restricted. Open&nbsp;Access&nbsp;to publications will open science. Another thing that stood out for me during my&nbsp;Master&rsquo;s&nbsp;years was the concept of &ldquo;Reproducibility&rdquo;. When I was writing my methodology chapter, I kept being reminded about this, because&nbsp;in order for&nbsp;someone else to learn, they need to understand what I did and be able to do it again and get similar results. This meant to me that more than being able to prove how credible the work was, it was going to allow someone else to do what I did with different samples in a completely different location and build the database of results using the same methods I did. So open access will allow for a more exponential growth in research and science.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>MM:</strong>&nbsp;Open data science in my opinion plays an important role for people from countries where their institutions may not always subscribe to what allows easy access of&nbsp;information&nbsp;for example publications.&nbsp;On the whole, I think it is important to allow for reproduction of the work, comparisons and future use by those after us. Mainly also because interpretations may vary within the discipline, it is important to put it all out there to encourage&nbsp;discussions&nbsp;especially for the research methods. As for how it can benefit my community&hellip;that is a tough one if the community in this case is the general public as this kind of data is often in a format that they are not seeking for.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Nucleotide excision repair is an essential mechanism to remove bulky DNA adducts, including UV-induced DNA lesions. Many techniques have been developed to detect DNA damage and repair, some of which are based on Next Generation Sequencing, providing genome-wide information.</p>
<p>To date, genome-wide repair maps have been generated for model organisms, including <em>Escherichia coli</em>, <em>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</em>, <em>Drosophila melanogaster</em>, <em>Arabidopsis thaliana</em>, <em>Mus musculus</em>, and <em>Homo sapiens</em>. Akkose <em>et al.</em> wanted to compare repair patterns between humans and a deeply diverged non-human primate, selecting the gray mouse lemur, <em>Microcebus murinus</em>. A recent chromosome level reference genome for the gray lemur revealed that mouse lemur and human orthologs share ~ 91% identity, though we currently lack an in-depth understanding of this species’ genomic features such as epigenetic maps, transcriptomes and methylomes.</p>
<p>Given that mouse lemurs and humans last shared a common ancestor at the base of the primate clade, the same cell types from human and mouse lemur should behave similarly in response to DNA damage as a reflection of their deep homology. This study obtained transcriptomes from mouse lemur fibroblasts, exposed cells to UV and performed XR-seq, then compared lemur and human fibroblast XR-seq datasets for their genomic repair distribution. The results of this study demonstrated that the genome-wide UV repair profiles between humans and the gray mouse lemur are strongly correlated.</p>

<p>Therapeutic climbing has long been believed to have a positive effect on health problems, especially on perceived self-efficacy. Now, a trial carried out in Germany has shown that bouldering psychotherapy (BPT) leads to a relevant enhancement of perceived self-efficacy in people with depression, results which seem comparable to cognitive behavioural therapy. In fact, the effect of the BPT was noted to be superior compared to the effect of solely physical exercise.</p>
<p>BPT is carried out in groups by climbing therapists, and entails bouldering exercises, mindfulness exercises, psychoeducation, exchange between participants and transfer to daily life, body-related relaxation exercises, and free bouldering. Future studies should hopefully focus on whether BPT is also beneficial for other mental or physical disorders.</p>

<p>People experiencing homelessness have high levels of dental decay, oral cancer and poor oral health-related quality of life. The Scottish Government sought to address these issues by developing a national oral health improvement programme for people experiencing homelessness, named Smile4life. However, was this a successful program, was it being implemented in the best possible way? This study from the University of Dundee and University of St Andrews sent out surveys in Scotland, aimed at participants working within the homelessness sector or within NHS Boards where they were associated with services for people experiencing homelessness. The results from this survey identified recommendations that may be used to promote the future delivery of Smile4life, and support practitioners. Future steps should include training centred on the specific needs of those involved in the homelessness sector and the development of accessible training resources, thereby promoting implementation behaviours to assist the progression and sustainability of the Smile4life programme.</p>

<p>Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a serious respiratory illness caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). During the COVID-19 pandemic, the number of cases of dengue increased. Dengue is the most common arboviral infection affecting humans in tropical and subtropical regions of the world. Every year, an estimated 96 million dengue infections are reported with 21,000 deaths worldwide.</p>
<p>Co-infection with both SARS-CoV-2 and the dengue virus is a serious public health concern due to the overlapping clinical and laboratory features of both diseases, making diagnosis and management of both diseases difficult. Despite similarities in signs and symptoms (like fever, headache and body pain), and laboratory characteristics (like thrombocytopenia and leukopenia) of these two diseases, their management is completely different. Hence, specific tests using RT-PCR or ELISA are necessary to confirm the diagnosis of these diseases.</p>
<p>Delayed diagnosis of co-infection with both SARS-CoV-2 and the dengue virus can result in serious patient complications with poor outcomes. The systematic review from Tsheten <em>et al.</em> underscores the importance of accurate and timely diagnosis using virus-specific tests.</p>

<p>Randomization is the foundation of any clinical trial involving treatment comparison. It helps mitigate selection bias, promotes similarity of treatment groups with respect to important known and unknown confounders, and contributes to the validity of statistical tests.</p>
<p>Various randomization procedures are available, so how do you choose the best one? This paper provides a roadmap to using randomization in clinical trials, taking into account a variety of factors and methodologies. Berger <em>et al.</em> conclude that the choice of randomization design, data analytic technique (parametric or nonparametric), and analysis strategy (randomization-based or population model-based) are all very important considerations. Randomization-based tests were found to be robust and valid alternatives to likelihood-based tests and should be considered more frequently by clinical investigators.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Global diversity</strong></p>
<p>As the first open access publisher, BMC has openness and accessibility at the forefront of what we do and has ensured that the research we publish reaches an international audience. Our approach to peer review also reflects this diversity. Reviewers are contacted based on their experience and expertise and we approach researchers around the world to review. In the table we show the global diversity of reviewers in our 5 largest journals.</p>

<p>To increase <a href="https://www.springernature.com/gp/advancing-discovery/springboard/blog/blogposts-trust-integrity/strengthening-trust-in-peer-review-through-transparency/18399148">openness and transparency into the peer review process</a> and also to enable increased diversity in our reviewer pool, the BMC Series has introduced <a href="https://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcblog/2020/05/04/transparency-openness-and-peer-review/">transparent peer review</a>. The BMC Series was the pioneer of open peer review that requires that the reviewer’s identity is revealed to the authors. For transparent peer review, reviewer reports are published for all peer reviewed content and reviewers can choose to remain anonymous or sign their report. The move to transparent peer review followed community feedback that reviewers being required to share their name was a barrier for them agreeing to review. Some reviewers may be hesitant to have their name shared, particularly if they are at an early stage in their career or are concerned with having their name revealed to the authors and the public. Giving the option to sign a report allows reviewers to choose for themselves whether they want to reveal their identity.</p>

<p><strong>Supporting peer reviewers<img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-12535" src="https://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2021/09/laptop-2-300x200.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200" srcset="https://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2021/09/laptop-2-300x200.jpg 300w, https://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2021/09/laptop-2-640x427.jpg 640w, https://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2021/09/laptop-2.jpg 692w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></strong></p>
<p>Reviewing for the first time might seem daunting and there may be uncertainty on what is expected from a reviewer and how to prepare a report. By providing support and guidance for our reviewers, we hope to increase clarity on the peer review process and increase their confidence in their role as a reviewer. The BMC Blog Network has resources on ‘<a href="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcblog/tag/how-to-peer-review/">how to peer review for beginners</a>’ that will guide novice reviewers in their role. <em>BMC Medicine</em> has a <a href="https://www.biomedcentral.com/collections/peerreviewtips">collection</a> of commissioned articles from experts in different types of research methodology that provides peer review tips for junior reviewers.</p>
<p>At the BMC Series, we want to support those who review for us and provide them with the information they need when reviewing a manuscript for a BMC Series journal. We have created the <a href="https://www.biomedcentral.com/p/the-bmc-series-journals/for-reviewers">BMC Series Reviewers&#8217; page</a> that provides a guide on responding to our invite to review, how to assess and prepare a report for a BMC Series manuscript and what to expect after reviewing. Editors from the BMC Series were also involved in developing statistics checklists for editors and reviewers to use when evaluating the statistics in manuscripts and these are now part of our <a href="https://www.biomedcentral.com/getpublished/editorial-policies#standards+of+reporting">standards of reporting</a>.</p>
<p>Editors across the selective BMC journals (<a href="https://bmcbiol.biomedcentral.com/"><em>BMC Biology</em></a><em>, </em><a href="https://bmcmedicine.biomedcentral.com/"><em>BMC Medicine</em></a><em>, </em><a href="https://genomebiology.biomedcentral.com/"><em>Genome Biology</em></a> and <a href="https://genomemedicine.biomedcentral.com/"><em>Genome Medicine</em></a>) and the BMC Series are taking part in an initiative launched in 2020 by Nature Communications to engage specifically with <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-021-23455-8">early career researchers (ECRs)</a>. The ECR program aims to support ECRs in becoming effective peer reviewers, provide outreach and instruction to ECRs on how to properly review manuscripts, and identify potential ECR candidates in order to expand current reviewer pools.</p>
<p><em>BMC Biology</em> and <em>BMC Medicine</em> have recently adopted a collaborative editorial model that directly involves Editorial Board Members in the assessment, handling, and decision making of manuscripts, granting the opportunity to scientists to manage the peer review process, while being fully supported by experienced in-house editors. The Editorial Board Member model has an open call on the journals’ websites for those interested in becoming EBMs. In addition, <em>BMC Biology</em> offers the opportunity to scientists to apply to become <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeQUInBDnH_GI9mAN82kjgBQpzsDxKCtpY2gIlOt4yan6-erg/viewform">reviewers</a> at the journal.</p>
<p>We hope that providing training, resources, and opportunity will remove the barrier that researchers may face through lack of experience as a reviewer or not understanding the process and expectations. This will enable us to expand and diversify our reviewer pools by giving more people the guidance needed to be a reviewer.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Increasing inclusivity and diversity</strong></p>
<p>We continue to explore new approaches to increase diversity and inclusivity in the people who review for our journals. <em>BMC Psychology</em> has launched a new collection ‘<a href="https://www.biomedcentral.com/collections/PDRI">Psychology of Diversity: The Road from Racism to Inclusion</a>’ that encourages submissions of research on diversity, equity and inclusion. The journal is taking applications from researchers who are interested in being a reviewer for this collection and with the journal’s transparent peer review, they can choose to have their name publicly shared if the paper is published.</p>
<p><em>BMC Musculoskeletal Disorders </em>and <em>BMC Rheumatology</em> have launched a joint collection that is focussed on <a href="https://www.biomedcentral.com/collections/PPI-RMD">Patient and Public Involvement in Rheumatic and Musculoskeletal Research</a>. The collection will allow interested patients, carers and members of the public to be involved in the peer review process. This will give them insight into scientific publishing and a voice in research.</p>
<p>Reviewers’ time is extremely valuable and often the reviewers we contact will not be available to review a manuscript. We encourage these reviewers to provide suggestions of alternative researchers when declining our invitation. We aim for gender, race, ethnic, geographic, career stage and other diversity in our reviewer pool. Our peer review invitations ask that reviewers consider alternative reviewers from underrepresented communities.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Future plans</strong></p>
<p>Our resources will keep being developed to ensure that all reviewers are informed and supported in their role. Greater recognition needs to be given to early career researchers who peer review with their supervisor. We will look at how the names of those who contributed to a reviewer report can be included and credit given to acknowledge their work. As research and community standards advance, publishing needs to also develop. One example is the move to open data and data sharing. Building opportunities for early career researchers to review standardised format articles such as <a href="https://bmcresnotes.biomedcentral.com/submission-guidelines/preparing-your-manuscript/data-note">Data Notes</a> so they can use their expertise to ensure community standards are adhered to. In the future we hope to create initiatives to ensure that reviewers from diverse backgrounds and underrepresented communities are afforded opportunity, encouraged, and supported.</p>
<p>BMC is committed to progressive and innovative approaches in publishing. By working with the research community and listening to their feedback, we will continue to make peer review more transparent and inclusive.</p>

                <p><em>By </em><a href="https://twitter.com/E_Barratt">Emma L. Barratt</a></p>



<p>There’s nothing less funny than explaining a joke. But analysing humour can actually tell us a lot about the development of sympathy and empathy in children.</p>



<p>Having a joke land is a complex task which requires an in-depth understanding of both the situation and mental state of the person on the receiving end. One audience, for example, might find a joke hilarious, whereas another might find that same joke wildly offensive.</p>



<p>Zeroing in on the appropriate joke, therefore, is likely to require a good amount of empathy. This ability to imagine the thoughts and feelings of your audience is pivotal to humour being well-received, but the relationship between humour and empathy has only been addressed in a handful of studies so far. However, <a href="https://ejop.psychopen.eu/index.php/ejop/article/view/1934/1934.pdf">new research</a> from Caitlin Halfpenny and Lucy James at Keele University gives us a window into how empathy shapes humour by taking a look at junior schoolchildren’s use of jokes, and the different humour styles that emerge with different levels of empathy and sympathy.</p>



<span id="more-43919"></span>



<p>The team asked 214 junior school children aged between 9 and 11 years old to complete two self-report questionnaires. The first, the Humour Styles Questionnaire for young children (HSQ-Y), was used to identify which of four types of humour style the kids use: <em>self-enhancing</em> and <em>affiliative</em>, which are both adaptive humour styles, and <em>aggressive</em> and <em>self-defeating</em> humour, which are considered maladaptive. The second measure, the Thinking and Feeling Questionnaire (TFQ), looks at cognitive and affective empathy, as well as sympathy. Cognitive empathy can be thought of as intellectually understanding the perspective of another person, whereas affective empathy is the ability to feel congruent emotions in response to the conditions of others.</p>



<p>Analyses found that self-enhancing humour, which is used to relieve tension, boost mood, and overcome hardship, was the only style identified to be positively correlated with both types of empathy and sympathy. Kids who displayed this style, the authors suggest, are able to take on the perspective of their audience, understand their emotions, and sympathise with them.</p>



<p>The affiliative humour style, which primarily takes the form of humour to facilitate social interaction by amusing others, was found to positively correlate with just cognitive empathy, but not affective empathy or sympathy. This may reflect varying levels of cognitive development in this age group — it may be that the ability to sympathise had not yet fully developed in the children using this humour style.</p>



<p>As might be expected, aggressive humour was negatively correlated with measures of both affective empathy and sympathy, consistent with previous research on adults. Children who score low on these measures may be unable to appreciate the views and emotions of the audience, and thus struggle to adjust humour accordingly. Interestingly, displaying this maladaptive type of humour may limit the opportunities children have to socialise, giving them less of a chance to develop more adaptive humour styles.</p>



<p>Standing somewhat alone amongst the four styles, self-deprecating humour was not correlated with either measure of empathy. This may be due to the fact that this style focuses inward, rather than being concerned with the emotions and situations of others, or indeed what they’ll find funny. However, the authors note that some children in this age range may be unable to self-report on this style, as they don’t fully grasp what self-deprecating humour encompasses.</p>



<p>Humour styles also varied significantly between genders: boys were more likely to report using aggressive humour styles than girls, and were less likely to score highly in affective empathy. The exact reasons for these gender differences weren’t probed in this study.</p>



<p>These patterns of relationship between humour styles, empathy, and sympathy are a wonderful illustration of the complexity of social interactions at this age. More developed empathy and sympathy seem to give rise to self-enhancing humour styles, which are in turn associated with a number of benefits, such as social intimacy, high self-esteem, and lower levels of depression and anxiety. As such, children who have fully developed their empathy and sympathy skills may have more positive social interactions. In much the same way, less development in these domains may lead to maladaptive humour styles, which could alienate the children using these styles from their peers, and further inhibit their empathetic and sympathetic development. It’s possible that identifying such humour patterns and providing support for empathetic and/or sympathetic growth in children who often use them, therefore, may help them on their way to more adaptive social strategies.</p>

<blockquote><p>The conservation and sustainable use of medicinal plant resources is attracting the attention of both scientists and the general public.</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>Medicinal plants<br />
</strong>In recent years, an increasing interest in medicinal plants and a growing therapeutic use of phytochemicals has occurred. Medicinal plants are applied for the production of phytopharmaceuticals, nutraceuticals and cosmeceuticals and their use is growing rapidly throughout the world: demand for wild resources has increased by <a href="https://doi.org/10.1186/s13020-016-0108-7">8–15 % per year in Europe, North America, and Asia in recent decades</a>. That is why the problem of the conservation and sustainable use of medicinal plant resources is attracting the attention of both scientists and the general public.</p>
<p><strong>Sustainable harvest<br />
</strong>Bulgaria is rich in medicinal and aromatic plant resources but recently they are being harvested in increasing volumes, largely from wild populations. As a result, many of these plants are now endangered species. The need of sustainable use of these valuable resources in Bulgaria resulted in a <a href="http://sf.mon.bg/?go=projects&amp;p=detail&amp;projectsId=49&amp;lang=en">project</a> supported by the EU and the Bulgarian government and dedicated to Sustainable utilization of bio resources and waste from medicinal and aromatic plants for innovative bioactive products. It is an interdisciplinary project coordinated by the <a href="http://srv.orgchm.bas.bg/EN/index_en.html">Institute of Organic Chemistry with Centre of Phytochemistry</a> (IOCCP) at the <a href="https://www.bas.bg/?lang=en">Bulgarian Academy of Sciences</a> and involves five more Bulgarian research institutions.</p>
<p><img class="size-thumbnail wp-image-12526 alignleft" src="https://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2021/09/sideritis-cult-140x110.jpg" alt="" width="140" height="110" />Natural reserves and wild nurseries are good ways to protect the plants and retain their medical efficacy in their natural habitats. However, it is not possible to designate every natural wild plant habitat as a protected area, so cultivation is the alternative. Cultivation under controlled conditions can result in higher yields of active constituents and guarantees production stability. Increased cultivation contributes to substantial decrease in the harvest volume of wild medicinal plants, benefits the recovery of their wild resources, and decreases their prices. In addition, cultivation can increase the income of people in rural communities and thus support the sustainable development of these communities.</p>
<p><strong>Sustainable processing<br />
</strong>The processing of medicinal plants for obtaining extracts and active constituents is an important part of their utilization. The increasing environmental concerns over the last decades have motivated the development of sustainable extraction strategies that follow the basic <a href="https://www.acs.org/content/acs/en/greenchemistry/principles/12-principles-of-green-chemistry.html">principles of green chemistry</a>. So an important aim of the abovementioned project is the development of sustainable extraction approaches to obtain various plant extracts with minimum impact on the environment (lower energy consumption, renewable solvents, etc.). Green extraction technologies are able to reduce or eliminate the use of hazardous substances and limit the cost of solvent waste disposal; among them are supercritical fluid extraction, pressurized liquid extraction, and ultrasound-assisted extraction, all considered sustainable techniques.</p>
<img class="alignright wp-image-12525 size-medium" src="https://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2021/09/MSlab1-300x225.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" srcset="https://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2021/09/MSlab1-300x225.jpg 300w, https://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2021/09/MSlab1.jpg 627w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />
<p><strong>Utilization of wastes<br />
</strong>Industrial processes that utilize medicinal and aromatic plants (MAPs) generates various kinds of residues like residual biomasses from distillation of aromatic plant and non-utilized parts of medicinal plant. The extraction residue is often treated as a waste to dumping. However residual biomasses should not be considered as waste as these can actually be recycled. These biomasses are suitable for isolation of phytochemicals like phenolics-antioxidants and converted into value added products. A good example of such utilization is the large amount of wastes generated by the production of the famous Bulgarian rose oil. One of the partner in our project, the Agrobioinstitute (Sofia) developed a technological scheme for combined utilization of waste rose biomass, aimed at the extraction of polyphenol substances and subsequent fractional extraction of polysaccharides. An additional advantage of this integrated approach is that it could be further combined with other methods and applied to other essential oil plant wastes. Valorizing by-products from the residual biomass from medicinal and aromatic plants is one of the potential ways to achieve a sustainable economy.</p>
<p><strong>A success story<br />
</strong>A success story is the one of a very popular medicinal plant, Mountain tea <em>Sideritis scardica</em>, endemic to the Balkan Peninsula. It is used for wound and burn healing, treatment of gastric ulcer, the common cold and mucous membrane inflammation. In the 1990’s, the collection of wild-growing <em>Sideritis scardica </em>became very extensive: it was in danger of extinction and was included in the Red Book list of Bulgaria. To respond to the demand of the consumers, our colleagues with the Institute of Botany developed a very productive cultivar and cultivation was gradually developing and is now very popular in rural communities with appropriate climatic and environmental conditions. We chemists studied the sustainable extraction methods and suggested the most appropriate approaches for this plant. And now, in the frame of our big project, we have recently filed a patent for a cosmeceutical based on this plant extract.</p>
<p><img class="alignleft wp-image-12527 size-medium" src="https://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2021/09/CCJO_SDG15-300x168.png" alt="" width="300" height="168" srcset="https://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2021/09/CCJO_SDG15-300x168.png 300w, https://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2021/09/CCJO_SDG15-640x359.png 640w, https://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2021/09/CCJO_SDG15.png 709w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />In conclusion, the growing global demand for natural and environmentally-friendly products today has a great potential for sustainable development. The cultivation, processing and trade of high-value medicinal and aromatic plants could contribute to social equity, environmental conservation and economic prosperity.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/whirling-maple-seeds-inspired-tiny-flying-sensors-microfliers">Whirling maple seeds inspired these tiny flying sensors</a></h4>

              
                <p>Like helicoptering maple seeds, tiny new fliers whirl gracefully as they glide.</p>



<p>The miniature aircraft, which can be made as small as a grain of sand, could be dispersed by air over long distances. Scientists envision that these microfliers, when equipped with wee sensors for measuring environmental conditions, could monitor pH, test for heavy metals or assess hazards like chemical spills, for example. The devices could also <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/tiny-sunlight-powered-aircraft-could-soar-beyond-airplanes-reach">track conditions in the atmosphere</a> while aloft (<em>SN: 2/12/21</em>).</p>



<p>The maple tree–lined streets north of Chicago, where materials scientist John Rogers lives, served as inspiration for the new microfliers. But Rogers, of Northwestern University in Evanston, Ill., and colleagues went smaller-than-life when designing their fleet. Some of the whirligigs are just half a millimeter across, the team reports in the Sept. 23 <em>Nature</em>. The researchers used computer simulations <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-021-03847-y">to help select the microflier shapes best for smooth flight</a>, designing rotors of various sizes and with different numbers and shapes of blades.</p>



<p>As with <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/how-maple-fruits-fall">maples’ seed-copters and those of other plants</a>, the fliers’ blades induce spinning motions that help stabilize flight (<em>SN: 6/11/09</em>). The designs also decrease the speed at which the microfliers fall, giving them more time to disperse. One flier fell at about 28 centimeters per second, less than half the speed of natural whirligigs from various plants.</p>



<p>In the future, the researchers plan to make biodegradable versions of the fliers, so that the objects could be scattered without defiling the environment.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/dna-genetics-how-polynesia-settled-migration-islands-pacific-ocean">DNA offers a new look at how Polynesia was settled</a></h4>

              
                <p>Polynesian voyagers settled islands across a vast expanse of the Pacific Ocean within about 500 years, leaving a genetic trail of the routes that the travelers took, scientists say.</p>



<p>Comparisons of present-day Polynesians’ DNA indicate that <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-021-03902-8">sea journeys launched from Samoa</a> in western Polynesia headed south and then east, reaching Rarotonga in the Cook Islands by around the year 830. From the mid-1100s to the mid-1300s, people who had traveled farther east to a string of small islands called the Tuamotus fanned out to settle Rapa Nui, also known as Easter Island, and several other islands separated by thousands of kilometers on Polynesia’s eastern edge. On each of those islands, the Tuamotu travelers built massive stone statues like the ones Easter Island is famed for.</p>



<p>That’s the scenario sketched out in a new study in the Sept. 23 <em>Nature</em> by Stanford University computational biologist Alexander Ioannidis, population geneticist Andrés Moreno-Estrada of the National Laboratory of Genomics for Biodiversity in Irapuato, Mexico, and their colleagues.</p>



<p>The new analysis generally aligns with archaeological estimates of human migrations across eastern Polynesia from roughly 900 to 1250. And the study offers an unprecedented look at settlement pathways that zigged and zagged over a distance of more than 5,000 kilometers, the researchers say.</p>





<p>“The colonization of eastern Polynesia was a remarkable event in which a vast area, some one-third of the planet, became inhabited by humans in … a relatively short period of time,” says archaeologist Carl Lipo of Binghamton University in New York, who wasn’t involved in the new research.</p>



<p>Improved radiocarbon dating techniques applied to remains of short-lived plant species unearthed at archaeological sites are also producing a chronology of Polynesian colonization close to that proposed in the genetic study, Lipo says.</p>



<p>In the new investigation, researchers identified DNA segments of exclusively Polynesian origin in 430 present-day individuals from 21 Pacific island populations. Island-specific genetic fingerprints enabled the scientists to reconstruct settlement paths, based on increases in rare gene variants that must have resulted from a small group moving from one island to another and giving rise to a new, larger population with novel DNA twists. Comparisons of shared Polynesian ancestry between pairs of individuals on different islands were used to estimate when settlements occurred.</p>



<p>In an intriguing twist, the DNA evidence “is consistent with the [statue] carving tradition arising once in a single point of common origin, likely the Tuamotu islands,” Moreno-Estrada says. Polynesian ancestry on all the islands with massive statues traces back to the one island in the Tuamotus where the researchers were able to obtain Indigenous peoples’ DNA.</p>



<p>The Tuamotus include nearly 80 islands situated between Tahiti to the west and other islands to the north and east where settlers carved statues. The latter outposts consist of the Marquesas Islands, Mangareva and Rapa Nui. Another late-settled island where inhabitants carved statues, Raivavae, lies southwest of the Tuamotus.</p>



<p>Settlers reached the island of Mataiva in the northern Tuamotus by about 1110, the researchers suggest. Statue makers navigated northward and eastward from Mataiva or perhaps other Tuamotu islands to as far east as Rapa Nui — eventually curving back west before arriving at Raivavae — around the same time as <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/south-americans-may-have-traveled-polynesia-800-years-ago">an earlier DNA study suggests eastern Polynesians mated with South Americans</a> (<em>SN: 7/8/20</em>). (It’s not clear whether South Americans crossed the ocean to Polynesia or Polynesians traveled to South America and then returned.)</p>

<p>Caption: An analysis of 430 present-day individuals is shedding new light on the timings and routes of early Polynesians’ migrations. Modern DNA indicates that voyagers left Samoa and went south and then east, reaching Rarotonga in the Cook Islands by around the year 830. From the mid-1100s to the mid-1300s, people who had traveled to the Tuamotu Islands, located just east of Tahiti, spread out to settle Rapa Nui, also known as Easter Island, and several other islands separated by thousands of kilometers. </p>

<p>Ioannidis and colleagues’ conclusions generally support prior scenarios of Polynesia’s settlement, but some disparities exist between their genetic evidence and earlier archaeological and linguistic findings, writes archaeologist Patrick Kirch of the University of Hawaii at Manoa in a commentary published with the new study.</p>



<p>For instance, the new DNA analysis overlooks extensive contacts that occurred across eastern Polynesian in its early settlement stages, Kirch says. Analyses of closely related eastern Polynesian language dialects and discoveries of stone tools that were transported from one island to another point to substantial travels and trading throughout the region during that time.</p>



<p>Kirch, who has previously suggested that these long-distance contacts in eastern Polynesian influenced stone carving traditions, calls the new proposal that people with a shared ancestry brought stone carving to Rapa Nui and other islands “a provocative hypothesis.”</p>



<p>And there’s still no answer to one major question regarding the settlement of the islands, says molecular anthropologist Lisa Matisoo-Smith of the University of Otago in Dunedin, New Zealand, who didn’t participate in the new research. No current line of evidence can resolve the mystery of why, after spending nearly 2,000 years on Samoa, Tonga and Fiji, Polynesians began voyaging thousands of kilometers eastward in search of new lands.</p>

                <p><em>By </em><a href="https://twitter.com/E_Barratt">Emma L. Barratt</a></p>



<p>The boundaries of personal space aren’t set in stone. They even vary widely from person to person, between cultures, and between environments (for example, we might give strangers a wide berth on the pavement, yet end up shoulder to shoulder on trains). And though it may not feel like it on public transport, personal space is a consideration in everything from the design of buildings to logistics for large events.</p>



<p>In 2020, Covid brought a whole new element to the table in terms of our comfort levels around other people. Maintaining a physical distance was one of the few things we could do for many months to limit the risk of infection, so for many of us, the personal space boundaries we were used to suddenly became no-gos.</p>



<p>This change is fantastically illustrated by a new preprint from Daphne Halt and team based in Boston, Massachusetts. The researchers believe that our personal space preferences not only tell us about the psychological effects of the pandemic, but may be of use as an indicator of progress towards regaining normality.</p>



<span id="more-43908"></span>



<p>To examine how the pandemic has affected people’s personal space preferences, they conducted a small study with 12 participants who had also completed pre-pandemic personal space investigations at the lab.</p>



<p>The team collected data on the size of participants’ personal spaces using the Stop Distance Procedure (SDP) — a task which measures the distance at which participants become uncomfortable with an approaching person, as well as where they become uncomfortable approaching the other party. This task was performed both typically (in a space with another person) and using virtual reality. The distance data collected during the pandemic was then compared to existing pre-pandemic data from each of the participants. Data on beliefs and experiences during the pandemic were also collected.</p>



<p>Results showed that, on average, the distances participants preferred to keep during the pandemic were significantly greater than their pre-pandemic personal boundaries, both in reality and virtually. Participants who showed a greater increase also tended to perceive the risk of infection as higher. Surprisingly, though, there was no relationship between this increase in distance and <em>actual</em> infection risk (as defined by the number of positive cases in the town in which the participant lived). &nbsp;</p>



<p>The authors say that the increase in people’s boundaries even in virtual reality, where there was no infection risk, may be indicative of changes to neural representations of the &#8220;safety zone&#8221; around our bodies, as well as sensorimotor circuits in the brain involved in maintaining our safety. These ideas, however, will need further investigation to verify. There’s also a possibility that this increase may persist beyond the pandemic; but, it’s just as possible that our need for more space will revert to pre-pandemic levels once the pandemic is over. The scale at which social distance measures were applied is unprecedented, and as such, it’s difficult to make predictions about what future average personal space boundaries may look like, respective to pre-pandemic levels.</p>



<p>Future research will be instrumental in addressing the above, as well as verifying that this phenomenon holds within a larger sample size. Cross cultural analyses may also be useful, though differences in Covid guidelines are likely to make cross-borders comparisons particularly difficult. Even so, this finding will be particularly interesting to those in fields that require estimations of personal space, and could potentially provide a basis for the development of tools to assess worry about infection in the general population.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/covid-coronavirus-who-gets-booster-shots-vaccines-pfizer-fda">Why only some people will get COVID-19 booster shots at first</a></h4>

              
                <p>In the United States, booster shots of Pfizer and BioNTech’s COVID-19 vaccine won’t be widely available to the general public starting this week. Instead, only certain groups will have access to a third dose of the vaccine: people 65 years and older, individuals 18 and older who are at high risk of severe COVID-19, and those whose jobs put them at high risk of getting infected.</p>



<p>These new guidelines come after nearly a week of intense debate and last-minute seesawing over who should be eligible for an extra dose.</p>



<p>The U.S. Food and Drug Administration on September 22 granted an emergency use authorization that opened the door for <a href="https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/fda-authorizes-booster-dose-pfizer-biontech-covid-19-vaccine-certain-populations?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">boosters</a> for these individuals, following the unanimous recommendation on September 17 by its panel of expert advisers.</p>



<p>But on September 23, an advisory panel for the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention rejected boosters for those who might be exposed to the coronavirus on the job. Panelists argued that the <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/acip/meetings/slides-2021-09-22-23.html">vaccine still works extremely well</a> and there&#8217;s no evidence of waning protection against hospitalization in this group. Still, the panel did vote that the older age group and individuals 50 to 64 years old who have health conditions, such as heart disease, diabetes or obesity, that put them at high risk of severe disease should get a booster dose.</p>





<p>For those ages 18 to 64 with underlying conditions, their individual risk and benefit should factor into booster decisions, the CDC panel said.</p>



<p>Hours later, CDC director Rochelle Walensky <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/media/releases/2021/p0924-booster-recommendations-.html">tweaked the guidelines</a> to once again include people whose jobs put them at risk of being exposed to SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19. That group includes essential workers like health care professionals, people who live in group settings such as homeless shelters and anyone whose job brings them within six feet of others. Like with younger people with underlying conditions, individual risk and benefit should be weighed. “In a pandemic, even with uncertainty, we must take actions that we anticipate will do the greatest good,” Walensky said in a Sept. 24 statement.</p>



<p>The guidance applies only to people who received the Pfizer vaccine. Decisions on boosters for Moderna’s and Johnson &amp; Johnson’s jabs — the other two COVID-19 vaccines available in the United States — still lie ahead.</p>



<p>Getting unvaccinated people vaccinated will still have the biggest impact on the pandemic, as well as following other public health measures like wearing masks, Katherine Poehling, a pediatrician at Wake Forest School of Medicine in Winston-Salem, N.C., said at the Sept. 23 CDC meeting. Two doses of the Pfizer vaccine are still highly effective for most people, she noted, even as some groups become eligible for a booster shot.</p>



<p>Both agencies&#8217; actions are more limited in scope than what the Biden administration proposed in August. Officials had announced plans to offer a third dose of Pfizer&#8217;s vaccine to the general public at least six months after vaccination starting September 20, pending an OK from the FDA.</p>



<aside class="wp-block-sciencenews-inline-related-post alignleft"><h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/sign-up-for-e-mail-updates-on-the-coronavirus-outbreak">Sign up for e-mail updates on the latest coronavirus news and research</a></h4></aside>



<p>Since officials unveiled that plan, it’s been widely debated. Some researchers — including Pfizer scientists — argue that because the vaccine’s protection against infections is waning, that could foreshadow a possible dip in protection against severe disease too. So the time to bolster everyone’s protection with a third dose is now, these researchers say. But others disagree, contending that <a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(21)02046-8/fulltext">it’s more important to focus on getting doses to unvaccinated people first</a>, and that many younger, healthy vaccinated people remain well-protected against severe disease and death after just two doses.</p>



<p>Third doses are already authorized for moderately to severely immunocompromised people who <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coronavirus-covid-19-booster-shots-vaccines-immunocompromised-people">may not develop good protection from the initial shots</a> (<em>SN: 7/23/21</em>). The case for another dose was obvious for that group, says Mark Slifka, a viral immunologist at Oregon Health &amp; Science University in Portland who wasn’t involved with the FDA panel. The data were “clear as day that the third dose was important” and could help boost the levels of protective antibodies in some patients.</p>



<p>But moving forward for the general population requires more specialized consideration, Slifka notes. “I think part of it comes down to what’s our level of risk tolerance.”</p>



<p>Here are some of the key questions that influenced the FDA panel’s recommendation.</p>



<h4>Is vaccine effectiveness starting to wane?</h4>



<p>COVID-19 vaccines are still largely <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/covid-coronavirus-vaccines-hospital-cases-rates-unvaccinatedhttps:/www.sciencenews.org/article/covid-coronavirus-vaccines-hospital-cases-rates-unvaccinated">keeping people out of the hospital</a> in the United States, studies show (<em>SN: 8/31/21</em>). Even as infections among vaccinated people go up, protection against hospitalization and death remains high, CDC epidemiologist Sara Oliver said at the September 17 meeting.</p>



<p>That’s true for all three vaccines — developed by Pfizer, Moderna and J&amp;J — available in the United States even with the spread of the highly contagious delta variant. Before delta dominated in the country, estimates of vaccine effectiveness against hospitalization in adults 18 and older ranged from 84 to 97 percent. That’s compared with 75 to 95 percent effectiveness after the variant took over, Oliver said. Effectiveness against infection, on the other hand, has dipped from 72 to 97 percent before delta to around 40 to 84 percent. &nbsp;</p>



<p>Still, data from Israel — the first country to vaccinate the majority of its population against COVID-19 — hint that over time Pfizer’s COVID-19 vaccine becomes less effective at preventing severe disease, particularly in people age 60 and older. That trend spurred public health officials there to begin offering a booster dose to that age group July 30 amid a spike in cases.</p>



<p>That third dose seems to have helped. People age 60 and older who didn’t receive a booster were <a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/10.1056/NEJMoa2114255">11 times as likely to be infected with the coronavirus</a> and nearly 20 times as likely to develop severe disease compared with those who got a third dose at least 12 days earlier, researchers reported September 15 in the <em>New England Journal of Medicine</em>. Preliminary data presented at the September 17 meeting suggest that the same trend may occur in people ages 40 to 59.</p>



<p>The booster brings vaccine efficacy back up to levels seen before delta came on the scene, Sharon Alroy-Preis, head of public health services at Israel’s Ministry of Health, told the FDA panel. “It’s like a fresh vaccine.”</p>



<p>It’s less clear, however, that protection against the worst of COVID-19 wanes in younger people, too, contributing to the FDA panel’s recommendation for boosters for those age 65 and older. But that should become clearer in the coming months, as researchers continue to monitor the situation.</p>



<p>In Israel, everyone over age 12 became eligible on August 29 for a third shot at least five months after a second dose. That decision was made because officials wanted to control the latest surge in cases, and limiting transmission would have been difficult without vaccinating everyone eligible, Alroy-Preis said.</p>



<p>Estimates suggest that transmission in Israel is indeed slowing. By one measure, infected people tend to pass the virus on to fewer than one other person, meaning the outbreak could begin to fizzle out. While hospitalizations and severe cases have stabilized since people began receiving boosters, however, the overall number of COVID-19 cases remains high.</p>



<p>That disparity may exist because the country opened schools on September 1 and many Israelis have gathered in holiday celebrations, Alroy-Preis said. But once things settle down, officials will likely have a better sense of where things stand. “We feel the booster effect, but we are not over the fourth wave yet,” she said.</p>





<h4>How safe is it to give people a third dose?&nbsp;</h4>



<p>Many experts on the FDA panel expressed concerns about the possibility of <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/covid-vaccine-side-effects-coronavirus-myocarditis'">heart inflammation, a condition called myocarditis</a>, that has been linked to mRNA vaccines such as Pfizer’s, particularly in young males (<em>SN: 6/1/21</em>). Most cases are mild and are easily treated.</p>



<p>Experts have determined that the benefits of COVID-19 vaccines to prevent severe disease outweigh the risk of myocarditis. But most panelists were reluctant to come to the same conclusion for a booster dose for younger age groups without more data.</p>



<p>Since boosters started rolling out in Israel, officials so far have documented only one case of myocarditis out of 2 million doses — in a male in his thirties. However, not enough time has passed to know for sure: Most younger people received a third dose within the last two weeks. Officials are actively monitoring for myocarditis reports, Alroy-Preis said. In Pfizer’s clinical trial testing a third dose, none of the more than 300 participants developed myocarditis.</p>



<p>But that data did little to alleviate the concerns of the FDA panel. Not only is the picture from Israel not yet certain, but some panelists were also concerned that the Pfizer trial included too few people.</p>



<p>More than a million third doses have been given in the United States, noted Hayley Gans, an infectious disease pediatrician at Stanford University, at the meeting. So there could be a larger pool of safety data to consider. But without that data available, it feels like trying to make a decision without all the pieces, Gans said. Oliver, the CDC epidemiologist, said that the data would probably be released in the coming days.</p>



<p>Aside from the uncertainty surrounding myocarditis, a third dose appears safe. Side effects like pain at the injection site, fever and chills were mostly mild and occurred at similar rates as after a second dose.</p>



<h4>How long might the boost in immunity last?</h4>



<p>No one knows for sure, but increasing the time between doses does traditionally prompt longer-lasting vaccine protection, Slifka says. While that’s not always the case, “I doubt [any COVID-19 booster] will be shorter-lived than what we have,” in terms of immunity, he says. “It’s either going to be equal to or longer” than at least six months. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Giving people a third dose of Pfizer’s vaccine does boost <a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMc2113468">antibodies to levels that surpass those seen after a second dose</a>, researchers reported September 15 in a separate study in the <em>New England Journal of Medicine</em>.</p>



<p>But, crucially, researchers don’t yet know what level of antibodies in the blood actually gives a person sufficient protection against the coronavirus in the first place. That would be helpful to pinpoint whether immunity, either after two or three doses, might have waned, James Hildreth, president of Meharry Medical College in Nashville, said during the FDA panel’s discussion.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Immunologist Michael Kurilla agreed. “We just can’t simply be in a position where we would just be vaccinating people every time we think there’s a problem,” so researchers need to get a better handle on how to measure protection, said Kurilla, of the National Institutes of Health’s National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences in Bethesda, Md.&nbsp;</p>



<aside class="wp-block-sciencenews-inline-related-post alignleft">
<h4>
<a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/editors-picks/2019-novel-coronavirus-outbreak">See all our coverage of the coronavirus outbreak</a>
</h4>
</aside>



<p>What’s more, our immune systems have the tools to remember the coronavirus after vaccination, which should prevent severe disease, Kurilla noted. And just two doses of Pfizer’s vaccine seem to spark long-lived immune memory — including cells that make antibodies as well as other immune cells that coordinate the immune response or kill infected cells — so the body can rapidly ramp up defenses if the coronavirus were to invade.</p>



<p>Booster shots could be useful to fortify weak immune memory, giving people better protection in the future. But given that many people already have developed that strong, long-lived immune memory, it’s unclear why they would even need a third jab right now, Kurilla said.</p>



<p>Our immune systems don’t work as well as we age, however. So older people may end up needing those boosters more than younger people.&nbsp;</p>



<h4>How would boosters affect the pandemic more broadly?</h4>



<p>Researchers on the FDA panel were divided on the answer to that question.</p>



<p>The effects of a third dose on controlling COVID-19 cases and spread in the United States would probably be minimal, some said. That’s partly because in this country, virus transmission is largely driven by high numbers of unvaccinated people, said Eric Rubin, a microbiologist and infectious disease physician at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health. So, giving boosters to vaccinated people could have little impact on spread overall.</p>



<p>Others, including Gans, said that to answer the question, they would like to see more data on the booster’s ability to curb transmission. If that data did show that fewer people are getting infected by people who have had three shots, then giving some people, such as parents or teachers, a vaccine booster to better prevent infection and spread might help protect kids who are too young to be vaccinated. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>What’s more, many experts around the world emphasize that to have the most impact on the pandemic, efforts should be focused on <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/covid-19-global-inequity-vaccines-deaths-economy-pandemic">getting vaccines to the unvaccinated</a>, not boosters to the vaccinated (<em>SN: 2/26/21</em>). In a push for vaccine equity, the World Health Organization has called for a moratorium on boosters until the end of the year. The vast majority of vaccine doses have made it into arms in high-income countries, while most people in low-income countries still lack protection, WHO Director General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said at a <a href="https://www.who.int/director-general/speeches/detail/who-director-general-s-opening-remarks-at-the-media-briefing-on-covid-19---8-september-2021">September 8 news briefing</a>. “We have been calling for vaccine equity from the beginning, not after the richest countries have been taken care of.”</p>





<h4>What about boosters for Moderna’s and Johnson &amp; Johnson’s vaccines?</h4>



<p>Most of the focus on boosters has centered on Pfizer’s COVID-19 vaccine, in part because Pfizer was the first pharmaceutical company to ask for booster approval from the FDA. But millions of U.S. residents have received vaccines developed by Moderna or J&amp;J. So what do we know about potential boosters for those vaccines?</p>



<p>For now, Moderna’s vaccine appears to be outperforming Pfizer’s, meaning that boosters might be less crucial (although a third dose <a href="https://investors.modernatx.com/news-releases/news-release-details/moderna-announces-submission-initial-data-us-fda-its-covid-19">does raise antibody levels</a>, even against coronavirus variants, the company says). When it comes to hospitalizations, Moderna’s shot was <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/70/wr/mm7038e1.htm?s_cid=mm7038e1_w">93 percent effective at keeping people out of the hospital as of August 15</a>, researchers reported September 17 in <em>Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report</em>. That’s compared with an estimated 88 percent effectiveness for Pfizer’s vaccine.</p>



<p>It’s unclear why there might be differences in effectiveness between the two vaccines, since both rely on the same mRNA technology. But it’s possible that the longer interval between first and second doses — four weeks for Moderna’s compared with three weeks for Pfizer’s — may help people develop a longer-lasting immune response, Slifka says. Plus, Moderna’s vaccine includes a higher dose than Pfizer’s does, which could also help. But it&#8217;s possible those differences will disappear over time as researchers collect more data, he says. &#8220;We&#8217;ll just have to wait and see.&#8221;</p>



<p>Fewer people have received J&amp;J’s single-dose COVID-19 vaccine than the mRNA vaccines, so there’s less information available on that shot. As of August 15, a single dose was around <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/70/wr/mm7038e1.htm?s_cid=mm7038e1_w">71 percent effective at preventing hospitalization</a>, researchers reported in that same September 17 study. That’s close to the nearly 75 percent efficacy against severe disease reported in late-stage clinical trials. And there’s <a href="https://www.jnj.com/johnson-johnson-announces-real-world-evidence-and-phase-3-data-confirming-strong-and-long-lasting-protection-of-single-shot-covid-19-vaccine-in-the-u-s">no evidence that protection wanes over time</a>, the company said in a September 21 news release.</p>



<p>But a second dose given two months after the first can <a href="https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.08.25.21262569v1">increase antibody levels and provide even better protection</a>, J&amp;J also announced. In clinical trials, that second shot had an efficacy of 94 percent against symptomatic COVID-19 in the United States, on par with the mRNA vaccines.</p>



<p>Waiting six months to give the second dose helped boost antibody levels even more, the company said. While the two-month-interval raised antibodies four to six times as high as after the first dose, six months between doses resulted in levels 12 times as high as a month after that second shot. And more antibodies <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coronavirus-covid-19-vaccines-second-dose-delay-complicated">could mean more protection</a> against COVID-19.</p>



<p>Booster data for these other shots <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2021/09/19/fauci-says-data-moderna-johnson-johnson-boosters-few-weeks-away-fda-review/">are on the docket for the FDA</a> to consider in the future. That could perhaps happen in a few weeks’ time, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases director Anthony Fauci told NBC News’ “Meet the Press” on September 19.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/~r/plos/Blog/~3/MedrO0ukLAk/">Ninth International Congress on Peer Review and Scientific Publication — call for abstracts</a></h4>

<p>Calling your attention to the call for abstracts for the ninth Peer Review Congress published this week. Details are available in this <a href="https://www.bmj.com/content/374/bmj.n2252">Editorial</a>, co-published by <a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2784485">JAMA </a>and the BMJ, and on the <a href="https://peerreviewcongress.org/">Congress website.&nbsp;</a> You can <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdnUH7Ekuw4">watch </a>the virtual symposium if you want to hear specifics from organizers of the Congress.</p>



<p>Every four year since 1989, the Peer Review Congress has brought together researchers, journal editors and all those who participate in the reporting and publication of scientific research, in order to put their own processes under scrutiny. The meetings have helped stimulate research into peer review and scientific publication &mdash; including studies of bias, reporting standards, prospective registration and many more topics.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The ninth Peer Review Congress will be held in September 2022 and the website will open for abstracts submissions on December 1, 2021.&nbsp;<strong>The</strong>&nbsp;<strong>deadline for abstract submissions will be January 31, 2022.&nbsp;</strong></p>



<p>The Congress was originally anchored by medical journals&ndash;the JAMA network, the BMJ and the Meta-Research Innovation Center (METRICS) at Stanford are its organizers and planners&ndash;but it now embraces a wide range of disciplines. Sharing findings and experimentation across disciplinary boundaries is particularly important. The audience of this meeting is unique and includes researchers, editors, funders, information innovators, policymakers, ethicists, journalists and more.</p>



<p>For this next congress, I have the honor to be part of an amazing&nbsp;<a href="https://peerreviewcongress.org/organizers-and-advisory-board/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Advisory Board&nbsp;</a>&nbsp;who will work with the organizers to shape the conference program. We look forward to receiving abstracts and helping to assemble a stimulating program of evidence-based discussions to improve the quality, effectiveness and fairness of peer review.</p>
