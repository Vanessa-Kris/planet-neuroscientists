                <h4><a href="https://www.maxplanckflorida.org/news-and-media/news/mpfi-scientist-receives-more-than-2-million-in-nih-funding-to-study-regulation-of-instructive-signaling-in-the-cerebellum/">MPFI Scientist Receives More than $2 Million in NIH Funding to Study Regulation of Instructive Signaling in the Cerebellum</a></h4>

<p>The Max Planck Florida Institute for Neuroscience (MPFI) announces that Dr. Jason Christie, MPFI Research Group Leader, has been awarded a grant in the amount of $2,082,074 over five-years to support ongoing investigation of neural circuits in the cerebellum that instruct and guide motor learning.</p>
<p>The cerebellum, an anatomically unique region of the brain, plays a central role in fine motor control and motor learning. When functioning normally, the cerebellum is essential in learning and performing skilled movements, but its dysfunction has been linked to movement disorders such as ataxia (progressive loss of fine motor skills) and dystonia (uncontrollable muscle contractions). These types of disorders make daily movements increasingly difficult as neurons in the cerebellum degenerate. The goal of this study is to identify how neurons in the cerebellum interact with one another, providing fundamental insights into the mechanisms underlying motor learning. Specifically, Dr. Christie and his team will examine the role of a prominent class of inhibitory interneurons that may determine how and when learning occurs. This project will provide new discoveries into the computational principles of the cerebellum and aid in the development of new therapies aimed at ameliorating diseases affecting motor control.</p>
<p>Motor learning occurs when mistakes are made while performing movements. Specialized cells in the cerebellum, called Purkinje cells, receive powerful instructive signals that guide our behavior and improve subsequent movements. What has remained largely unknown, is how these instructive signals are modulated to produce a spectrum of learning outcomes. Through his research, Dr. Christie has identified the importance of a key type of neuron, Molecular Layer Interneurons (MLIs), that may be essential in modulating error signals and driving adaptability of motor learning.</p>
<p>Employing the latest and most advanced imaging and genetic techniques, MPFI scientists in Dr. Christie’s lab will study the role of MLIs in motor learning from the cellular level, to circuit dynamics and ultimately, how their activation affects behavior. With the support of this crucial funding, Dr. Christie’s research will provide a better understanding of how neural circuits in the cerebellum ensure accurate movement, turning the motor errors we make into reliable, adaptable and meaningful learning; laying the foundational science that will lead to tomorrow’s cures.</p>
<p>Dr. Christie joined the Max Planck Florida Institute in July 2010 as Research Group Leader in Synaptic Signaling and Computation. Prior to this appointment, Dr. Christie conducted research at the Vollum Institute at the Oregon Health and Science University in Portland, Oregon, where he completed his doctoral and post-doctoral work. He has joint faculty appointments with  Florida Atlantic University.</p>

                <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/~r/plos/Blog/~3/SWFAnZXeP9E/">It’s Peer Review Week!!!</a></h4>

<img alt="" class="webfeedsFeaturedVisual wp-post-image" height="150" src="https://blogs.plos.org/plos/files/2018/09/Peer-Review-Gender_blog-image-150x150.png" style="display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;" width="150" /><p>Peer Review Week is a global event celebrating the essential role that peer review plays in how we evaluate and communicate most scholarly research. Our aim is to spark discussion and collaboration between researchers and publishers who want to improve scholarly communication. For that, there’s no better jumping off point than this year’s topic: diversity.</p>
<p><strong>How diverse is it? The scholarly landscape</strong></p>
<p>While the demand for STEM degrees is on the rise around the world, we still see a relatively small percentage of published papers out of countries in Africa and Latin America. Even more troubling, are the increasingly common stories of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/science/2018/jul/07/why-science-is-breeding-ground-for-sexism?CMP=share_btn_link">unsafe </a>working conditions, lack of resources, and <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2016/11/math-women/506417/">perceptual biases</a> keeping women out of many higher academic fields.</p>
<p>A study published by <a href="https://cdn.elifesciences.org/articles/21718/elife-21718-v1.pdf">eLife</a> found the percentage of female authors, reviewers, and editors in STEM publishing falls far below 50% and predicts these percentages, 37%, 28% and 26% respectively, would not achieve parity with male counterparts until 2042 if currents trends of growth continue. In some fields, the difference in representation is even more staggering. For example, a review of 435 Mathematical journals published in <a href="http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0161357"><em>PLOS ONE</em></a> found the median number of editorships held by women to be only 7.6%. Fifty-one journals had no women on their editorial boards at all.</p>
<p>According to the eLife study, both women and men show an inclination to appoint reviewers of the same gender, limiting possibilities for women on a journal with an editorial board comprised of mostly men and perpetuating the imbalance of representation. Another study in <a href="http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0192481"><em>PLOS ONE</em></a> found similar results, as well as evidence of preference for other shared background characteristics such as country or institution.</p>
<p>If a journal’s peer review process is only as diverse as the network of editors who oversee it, we must diversify our editorial boards.</p>
<p><strong>The role of publishers</strong></p>
<p>Publishers, as stewards for scientific research, have a responsibility to raise all voices of the community. To do that, we must offer the tools and opportunities for researchers from all backgrounds to participate in the scholarly discussion.</p>
<p>The first thing we can do is to actively seek an even mix of expertise, affiliation, nationality, and gender to represent the editorial board and journal staff. We also need to start stepping outside our comfort zones, ask ourselves whether our tried and true models really work for everyone or if they have <a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/13.7/2018/02/02/581849526/leaky-pipelines-plug-the-holes-or-change-the-system">hidden barriers</a> for certain groups. Some great advice for publishers and organizations is available <a href="https://scholarlykitchen.sspnet.org/2017/11/16/diversity-scholarly-communications/">here </a>and <a href="https://scholarlykitchen.sspnet.org/2017/12/12/tackling-diversity-scholarly-communications-part-2/">here</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Starting the conversation</strong></p>
<p>Peer review and how to make it better is the focus of many organizations that just last month penned an <a href="http://asapbio.org/letter">Open Letter</a> to the community regarding <a href="https://blogs.plos.org/plos/2018/08/transparency-credit-and-peer-review/">transparent peer review</a>. Through posted and signed reviews, we’re taking steps to further our understanding of peer review and to open up opportunities for critical conversations about peer review best practices.</p>
<p>Later this week, we’ll be posting an interview with <a href="https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/history/staff/aileenfyfe.html">Aileen Fyfe</a>, science publishing historian, who will talk about the importance of unique voices to advance scientific literature.  The <a href="https://blogs.plos.org/everyone/2018/09/10/peer-review-week-2018-diversity/">EveryONE blog</a> also has an additional perspective, as well as a <a href="https://collections.plos.org/gender-imbalance">collection</a> of papers on gender inequality in peer review.</p>
<p>In the meantime, we invite you to raise your own voice and share your experiences with the hashtags #PeerReviewWeek18 and #PeerRevDiversityInclusion.</p>

<p>Antibiotics can have a number of side effects, the most common being gastro-intestinal such as diarrhea. Antibiotic-associated diarrhea (AAD) is caused by antibiotics disrupting the ecology of the intestinal microbiota, altering the diversity and numbers of bacteria in the gut. This can lead to long-lasting effects on the balance of the intestinal microbiota and consequently on the patient’s susceptibility to infection and other diseases. In an article published in <em><a href="https://bmcgastroenterol.biomedcentral.com/">BMC Gastroenterology</a>, </em>Kort <em>et al. </em>present a practical guide to the use of probiotics for the prevention of antibiotic-associated diarrhea.</p>
<figure class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_10492" style="width: 970px;"><img alt="" class="wp-image-10492 size-full" height="566" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2018/09/antibiotics-1.jpg" width="960" /><div class="attachment-image--caption">Pixabay</div><div class="attachment-image--source"></div></figure>
<p>The researchers found that probiotics were associated with lower incidence of AAD overall. In addition, there are a number of factors affecting the efficacy of probiotics, such as strain composition, probiotic product formulation, and specific patient differences (e.g. – genetic factors). The researchers concluded that there is sufficient evidence to make a recommendation for the use of specific probiotic products for the prevention of AAD. In particular, Kort <em>et al.</em> recommend <em>Lactobacillus rhamnosus</em> GG as the most effective probiotic to prevent AAD.</p>
<h3><strong><em>BMC Psychiatry: </em><a href="https://bmcpsychiatry.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12888-018-1843-3">Men’s suicidality in Norway</a></strong></h3>
<img alt="Pixabay" class="wp-image-10414 alignright" height="287" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2018/07/Reasons-for-dying-300x300.jpg" width="287" />
<p>Gender has been emphasized as crucial for understanding suicidal behavior. Previous research has concluded that men who adhere to traditional masculinity seem to have increased health risks compared to those who do not. Further research has shown that some circumstances make men more vulnerable to suicidal behavior, such as single marital status, unemployment and retirement.</p>
<p>In a published article in <em><a href="https://bmcpsychiatry.biomedcentral.com/">BMC Psychiatry</a>,</em> Knizek and Hjelmeland sought to investigate what men who have engaged in a suicidal act perceived as crucial for their decision to harm themselves or attempt to take their life<em>.</em></p>
<p>The researchers conducted interviews with men who were admitted to hospital after a suicidal act. It was concluded that the main reason or trigger for the suicidal act were complex problems in intimate relationships, with some men saying pain and ennui were reasons. The most striking finding was how unique and different each story was, which makes it important to consider that standardized efforts of suicide prevention may not be beneficial.</p>

<p>Host plants (or the plants an organism relies on) are thought to play important roles in the evolution of various traits for herbivorous insects. Liu <em>et al.</em> sought to investigate the influence of host plant species and pine needle age on larval performances, adult mating behavior and fitness consequences in a capital breeding caterpillar, <em>Dendrolimus punctatus</em> Walker.</p>
<p>The researchers found that the pine species and needle age significantly affected larval performance, such as developmental duration, survivorship, and body weight. Male body weight was significantly influenced by pine species and needle age; however interestingly, female body weight was only significantly influenced by pine species, not by needle age.</p>
<p>The findings highlight the importance of larval host plants on larval performance and adult reproductive fitness in this pine caterpillar. The previous-year needles of one particular pine (masson pine <em>P. massoniana</em>) were concluded to be the best host for this pine caterpillar.</p>

Previous research has suggested that palliative care assessment should start as early as possible in ICU patients at a high risk of dying, to minimize unnecessary suffering.</p>
<p>A review article published in <a href="https://bmcanesthesiol.biomedcentral.com/"><em>BMC Anesthesiology</em></a> discusses palliative care in ICUs and provides anesthesiologists and critical care physicians practical advice on the application of palliative care in ICUs.</p>
<blockquote><p>ICU doctors should be familiar with and competent in all aspects of palliative care through dedicated training</p></blockquote>
<p>Currently, ICU doctors may not have the knowledge to effectively carry out palliative care. Therefore, Cortegiani <em>et al.</em> conclude that ICU doctors should be familiar with and competent in all aspects of palliative care through dedicated training. Such training would provide critically ill patients and their families access to care that would meet their needs and improve patients quality of life.</p>

<p>The regulation of emotions is considered to be important in children’s adaptive development. Previous studies have found that children who repeatedly fail to regulate their emotions in accordance to context are at greater risk of developing internalizing symptoms associated with anxiety and depression. Loevaas <em>et al</em>. sought to investigate the associations between anxious and depressive symptoms and difficulties in emotion regulation in Norwegian school children in a published article in <em><a href="https://bmcpsychology.biomedcentral.com/">BMC Psychology</a>.</em></p>
<p>The researchers found that a lack of positive strategies to regulate emotions were associated with anxious and depressive symptoms. Therefore, emotional regulation is considered to be a potentially important target in the prevention and identification of children at risk of anxiety and/or depression.</p>
<p>It was found that there was no difference between the maternal and paternal reports regarding the association between emotion regulation in children and anxiety symptoms; though there were differences for depressive symptoms. The study highlighted that research involving children should include both parents if possible, to prevent the chance of bias.</p>

During sleep, they were subjected to low-volume recordings that exhorted them to be better human beings: “Love shall rule your life. You shall love God, your family and others.  You shall do unto others as you want others to do unto you. . .” The low voice also warned them away from the evils of alcohol.<br /><br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-LCqcBZYGb7s/W5XUvtCjHJI/AAAAAAAAMnQ/-q1ZOQlbghYrKy13xer504kBgS0nbTIZwCLcBGAs/s1600/Learn%2Bwhile%2Byou%2Bsleep%2Balbum%2B%2528basic%2Bconditioner%2529.jpg" style="margin-left: 0em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" data-original-height="1024" data-original-width="1011" height="400" src="https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-LCqcBZYGb7s/W5XUvtCjHJI/AAAAAAAAMnQ/-q1ZOQlbghYrKy13xer504kBgS0nbTIZwCLcBGAs/s400/Learn%2Bwhile%2Byou%2Bsleep%2Balbum%2B%2528basic%2Bconditioner%2529.jpg" width="393" /></a></div><div style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://www.ebay.com/itm/LEARN-WHILE-YOU-SLEEP-KNIGHT-EDUCATION-INC-PLP-06-60s-RED-SELF-HELP-VINYL/273437929222" target="_blank" title="comes in groovy red vinyl"><span>Knight Education Recordings (1960s)</span></a><br /><span>a commercially available product of the era</span></div><br /><br />Even earlier, the <a href="https://centerhistorypsychology.wordpress.com/2017/02/23/the-psycho-phone/" target="_blank">Psycho-Phone</a> (<a href="https://centerhistorypsychology.files.wordpress.com/2017/01/ben2.jpg" target="_blank" title="Psychology: Health, Happiness, Success">Salinger, 1927</a>) played wax cylinders with different self-help messages, e.g., “Prosperity” and “Life Extension” on a phonograph while the unwitting customer slept.

These <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transcranial_direct-current_stimulation" target="_blank">transcranial direct current stimulation</a> (tDCS) kits are available online, with a primary goal of enhancing cognitive performance.

Conceptually, this is quite different from the discredited “subliminal  sleep learning” from days of yore. New research aims to improve retention of information learned during the day by delivering precisely timed and calibrated tACS during slow wave sleep (<a href="http://www.jneurosci.org/content/38/33/7314" target="_blank">Ketz et al., 2018</a>).<br /><br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-iztyMnlpaAo/W5YJD8otfhI/AAAAAAAAMno/B_njLqHMMWsRlqrHXpEVAzflmGT6jNwYACLcBGAs/s1600/tDCS%2Band%2BtACS%2Bexperimental%2Bprotocol.png" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" data-original-height="984" data-original-width="1305" height="301" src="https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-iztyMnlpaAo/W5YJD8otfhI/AAAAAAAAMno/B_njLqHMMWsRlqrHXpEVAzflmGT6jNwYACLcBGAs/s400/tDCS%2Band%2BtACS%2Bexperimental%2Bprotocol.png" width="400" /></a></div><br /><span><b>Fig. 1 (modified from <a href="http://www.jneurosci.org/content/38/33/7314" target="_blank">Ketz et al., 2018</a>).</b> <b>(A)</b> Target detection task. <b>(B)</b> Memory was tested on two image types: <u>Repeated</u> (identical to Original) and <u>Generalized</u> (same as Original but from different viewpoint). <b>(C)</b> tDCS montage used during training (left), and tACS montage used to augment slow waves during sleep (right).</span><br /><br /><br />During the day, participants were trained on a difficult military task that required them to detect hidden targets (explosive devices, snipers, suicide bombers) that were concealed or disguised (<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3387543/" target="_blank">Clark et al, 2012</a>). As in their earlier study, tDCS or sham stimulation was delivered during the training phase (over right frontal or right parietal cortices). Previous findings indicated that significant improvements in learning and performance were observed after 30 min tDCS (anodal 2.0 mA) vs. “<a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/ejn.12307" target="_blank" title="Challenges of proper placebo control for non‐invasive brain stimulation in clinical and experimental applications">sham</a>” (0.1 mA). However, this tDCS finding did not replicate in the current study (see <b>Fig, 3A</b>, <i>left </i>below). Why? The authors speculated that possible differences in current generation between their previous iontophoresis system (2.0 mA) and the present use of StarStim (1.0 mA) could explain the failure to replicate.<br /><br />After training, tACS was delivered during sleep. The authors' cool closed-loop approach recorded the dominant slow wave (SW) frequency, and then delivered stimulation to match the phase and frequency of this dominant oscillation (range of 0.5 to 1.2 Hz). <b>Fig. 3A</b> (<i>right</i>) doesn't look terribly impressive, however. tACS did not improve performance for Repeated images, and had highly variable effects for Generalized images. Nonetheless, the two- and three-way interactions were significant, as was the pairwise comparison between active tACS vs. sham for Generalized images (all p's ≈ .015 for n=16).<br /><br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-xLRKowSX1kM/W5YPIsxzP8I/AAAAAAAAMn0/CB7eq9rYR3k8P0UH2xD6yDtT-Q2q2aQuQCLcBGAs/s1600/waking%2BtDCS%2Beffects%252C%2BSW%2BtACS%2Beffects.png" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" data-original-height="876" data-original-width="979" height="357" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-xLRKowSX1kM/W5YPIsxzP8I/AAAAAAAAMn0/CB7eq9rYR3k8P0UH2xD6yDtT-Q2q2aQuQCLcBGAs/s400/waking%2BtDCS%2Beffects%252C%2BSW%2BtACS%2Beffects.png" width="400" /></a></div><br /><span><b>Fig. 3 (modified from <a href="http://www.jneurosci.org/content/38/33/7314" target="_blank">Ketz et al., 2018</a>).

While most White British women keep their consumption within the recommended safe limits, patterns of heavy drinking associated with long and short term health and social harms have <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/14659890802040880?src=recsys&amp;journalCode=ijsu20" rel="noopener" target="_blank">increased</a> in the last 40 years.</p>
<p>Studies have shown that women <a href="https://academic.oup.com/alcalc/article/47/3/355/146168" rel="noopener" target="_blank">consume more alcohol in private</a> (e.g. their own and others people’s homes) than in public settings (e.g. pubs and bars) and that heavy drinking can occur in couple relationships <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/add.13397" rel="noopener" target="_blank">as well as non-family relationships</a> (including friends, neighbours and work colleagues). Increased understanding of the meanings that alcohol has for women could help with developing appropriate and relevant interventions for heavy alcohol use.</p>
<h3><strong>The study</strong></h3>
<p><a href="https://bmcwomenshealth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12905-018-0629-6?utm_source=BMC_blog&amp;utm_medium=Blog&amp;utm_content=DavFal-BMC-BMC_Women's_Health-Behavior-Global&amp;utm_campaign=BMCS_USG_SEPT2018_Alcohol_White_British_Women" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Our work</a> explored one context for women’s alcohol use: in relation to stress. It was conducted in the North East of England where White British women have some of the <a href="https://files.digital.nhs.uk/pdf/s/q/hse2016-summary.pdf" rel="noopener" target="_blank">highest levels of heavy episodic drinking in the country</a>. We conducted one-to-one qualitative interviews with twenty-six women aged 24-67 years with a range of relationships statuses and from different socio-economic backgrounds.</p>
<p>None of the participants were in treatment for alcohol misuse, but their narratives suggested they drank at a range of levels, from irregular consumption to heavy regular consumption. We gathered data on the women’s experiences of stress, drinking practices generally and drinking practices in relation to stress.</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thematic_analysis" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Thematic analysis</a> and the application of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethics_of_care" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Feminist Ethics of Care Theory</a> helped to identify ‘care practices’ as one key theme in the data. This illustrated that they lacked opportunities for receiving care amongst their caregiving and paid work responsibilities. Overall, the key finding is that alcohol was incorporated in ‘care practices’ as a way of enabling care for self and care with others in their couple relationships, when alone and in non-family relationships.</p>
<h3><strong>The findings – alcohol and care practices in different relationships </strong></h3>
<p>Some women spent a lot of time alone at home, either because they lived alone, because they were single mothers or because their partners were frequently out. While often reflecting that they would rather be with others, these women described drinking as one way of caring for themselves when no options for human care were available. Penny, who at the time of interview had grown-up children, described a regular drinking practice alone when her children were younger:</p>
<p><em>‘(My husband) was out a lot at work, he was having to, you know, he was a Director of a company, . . . You didn’t have very much time for yourself and you probably, I probably did have a glass of wine when I was cooking the tea, because it might well have been that I was on my own more.’</em></p>

<p>Although they always considered their responsibilities to others first, drinking regularly in a controlled way was acceptable to Penny and some other women. However, drinking at home alone was not acceptable to all women and some said they did not like to drink alcohol when their children were in the house, as this was perceived to be putting themselves above their children. More commonly, women spoke about drinking in their couple relationships and with non-family members.</p>
<p>The couple relationship, which can come with greater expectations of care than other relationships, dominated many of the women’s accounts. For some women in the sample, paid work and unpaid caregiving in families meant they had little time to spend with their partner. Jane, a woman with three children aged under 10 years, explained a regular drinking practice with her husband. This example is representative of other participants’ accounts:</p>
<p><em>‘. . . it’s a drink just to drink because it’s Friday, do you na what I mean? Just sit with him and spend some adult time with him. . . . Ya na, after having three kids, I’ve learnt . . .  we have to make time for each other.’</em></p>
<p>A number of women like Jane had little freedom to leave the house with their partners, due to child care responsibilities and limited finances, so they were restricted in what they could do to demonstrate care for each other. Drinking together and spending time together at home was one way they did this.</p>
<p>Other participants who had more flexibility or financial resources to drink outside the home described practices of drinking in public settings (sometimes alongside other activities such as a meal) in a similar way. Drinking together played a role in helping to maintain the women’s relationships but could contribute to sometimes regular and sometimes irregular heavy drinking practices.</p>
<p>The data highlighted that non-family relationships can also be an important source of care for women. Drinking in these relationships offered opportunities for care, in particular emotional support, which was sometimes absent or limited in their couple and other family relationships. Nina was a single professional woman who lived alone who said she preferred not to drink alone at home. She described the value of a regular Friday night heavy drinking practice with her friends in the following way:</p>
<p><em>‘If I’ve had a really, really bad week, by Thursday I’ll be . . . at the end of my tether, and I’ll know that on Friday . . . I know there’s a group of people who will just listen to me go, how crap my week has been . . . ’</em></p>
<figure class="wp-caption alignleft" id="attachment_10500" style="width: 310px;"><img alt="" class="wp-image-10500 size-medium" height="200" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2018/09/alcohol3-300x200.jpg" width="300" /><div class="attachment-image--caption">Other participants described practices of drinking in public settings (sometimes alongside other activities such as a meal)</div><div class="attachment-image--source"></div></figure>
<p>Nina gained care in this practice that she did not gain anywhere else. Her account resembled some of the accounts of the mothers of dependent children who described the value of drinking practices with friends for providing care that was limited in their family and sometimes paid work roles.</p>
<p>The data also suggested that the women modified their drinking practices to fit in with their own and each other’s family roles and responsibilities. One participant spoke about drinking regularly and heavily at her friend’s house because her friend was a single mother and could not drink out of the house. Overall the data demonstrated the importance of sometimes heavy drinking with non-family for providing opportunities for care in their everyday lives.</p>
<h3><strong>What does this mean for intervention development? </strong></h3>
<p>This is a small study which may not be able to be extrapolated to a wide population. However, inferences can be made from the findings about approaches to intervention development. The key implication of the study is that interventions need to consider that both women’s own need for care and their responsibilities to others are important in their drinking practices. Addressing this lack of care by providing alternative ways for women to care for themselves and to gain social support might be valuable.</p>
<p>These approaches are at odds with the current approaches which are often based on individual behaviour change and see alcohol use as separate from women’s wider everyday lives and relationships.</p>

University of Bristol mysteriously lost its senior lecturer, Abderrahmane Kaidi. His institutional website was wiped out in August 2018. I obtained an internal email which lifts the mystery: Kaidi was namely found guilty of "having fabricated research data", and resigned with "immediate effect". Affected by research misconduct are also publications from Kaidi's postdoc period with Stephen Jackson in Cambridge.

These include the fact that the publishers castigated by the film would continue to dominate scholarly communication in an OA world; the increasingly expensive ‘pay-to-publish’ model, which substitutes inequities in access for inequities in affording publication; and the rise of predatory publishing. And although <i>Paywall</i> acknowledges that current reward systems have slowed the progress of OA publishing, it does not address the puzzling question of why academics have proved so reluctant to make copies of their published papers freely available in their institutional repositories ...</span></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><span><br /></span></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><span>More </span><a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-06140-7">here</a><span>.</span></div>

<p><em>By</em> <a href="http://www.psychologywriter.org.uk/">Christian Jarrett</a></p>
<p>With an increasing number of young children transitioning socially to the gender opposite to their birth sex, and with rates of bullying and discrimination against transgender youth known to be high, researchers say it is important that we begin to understand more about how cisgender children (those whose gender identity matches their biological sex at birth) view their transgender peers. A <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/15248372.2018.1498338">new paper</a> in the <em>Journal of Cognition and Development</em> is the first to explore the issue.</p>
<p><span id="more-34688"></span></p>
<p>Across two studies, a team led by Selin Gülgöz at the University of Washington in Seattle, presented dozens of cisgender five to ten-year-olds with vignettes about hypothetical peers who were either cisgender or transgender. For instance, in the second study, which used more comprehensive vignettes, one description the children heard was of a baby named Jack who was born with a boy’s body, but who liked playing girl games, wearing girl clothes and who told her parents she was actually a girl and wanted to be called Annie and referred to as “she” and “her”.</p>
<p>The participating children’s task was to rate how much they liked each child they heard about in the vignettes and to categorise them as either a boy or a girl.</p>
<p>The children generally rated their peers positively, whether cisgender or transgender. However, on average, they rated cisgender peers more positively than transgender peers. Note, though, that the well-known preference that children show for other kids of their own gender also applied, to an extent, to transgender identities – so, for cisgender girls, for instance, their liking for transgender girls (natal boys who had transitioned socially to a female identity) was higher than their liking for cisgender boys.</p>
<p>In terms of how they categorised the gender of their transgender peers, the participating children were inconsistent. Some categorised transgender peers by their natal sex (i.e. according to their biological sex at birth); others according to their peers’ transgender identity; while others switched between the two approaches. To the researchers’ surprise, they found that the older children – who they expected to be more accepting of transgender identities – were actually more likely to categorise transgender peers by their natal sex. The researchers speculated that this may be because of the older children’s growing sense of gender as a usually stable concept, rather than as malleable.</p>
<p>A final important finding was the association between how the cisgender children categorised their transgender peers and their patterns of liking towards those peers – specifically, those who tended to categorise transgender children by natal sex also showed less liking of them, mirroring similar findings with adults.</p>
<p>The new research makes a first contribution toward understanding this topic, but inevitably it has some significant limitations. Apart from the reliance on vignettes, this includes that the transgender children were all presented as being entirely gender stereotypical (i.e. behaving and having interests in line with the stereotypes associated with the gender they had transitioned to) – it remains to be seen how cisgender children might feel toward transgender peers who do not conform to the stereotypes of the gender they have transitioned to, especially considering young children’s tendency to hold peers who do not conform to gender stereotypes in low regard. Also, note these new findings are based on children from a liberal American city, whose parents were happy for them to participate in such research. One can imagine the findings being different in other cultures and contexts.</p>
<p>Gülgöz and her colleagues said “We look forward to future work that specifically investigates the relation between cisgender children’s attitudes toward their transgender peers and the well-being of those transgender children, as well as work investigating effective ways to reduce bias against transgender children.”</p>

<img alt="" class="attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image" height="110" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2018/09/Migraine-Brain-140x110.jpg" style="display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;" width="140" /><p>Migraine’s primary symptom is sudden and intense headache usually on one side of the head. The brains of migraineurs are different in both their structure and function. Migraineurs who experience more migraines have more <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3795609/pdf/WNL205445.pdf">structural abnormalities including decreases in grey matter and lesions in white matter</a>.</p>
<p>The functioning of the migraine brain is also atypical. Changes in the external and internal environments can trigger abnormal electrophysiological and vascular changes throughout the brain.</p>
<p>One neurophysiological <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nrneurol.2013.192">explanation for migraines is cortical spreading depression</a>. During cortical spreading depression, the electrical activity of neurons in a certain brain area is silenced. Once a certain threshold of depression occurs, this silencing spreads throughout the brain like a ripple in a pond.</p>
<p>Cortical spreading depression often begins in sensory associated brain areas such as those involved in vision. The origin in visual areas could explain the migraine aura, afflicting a third of migraineurs, which manifest as flickering lights or scintillating spots in the visual field preceding the onset of the headache.</p>
<p><img alt="" class="size-medium wp-image-10504 alignleft" height="200" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2018/09/Migraine-300x200.jpeg" width="300" />Vasodilation, the dilation of blood vessels, in the brain appears to be another cause for migraines. The trigeminal nerve which is found at the bottom of brain is important for sensation in the face and motor functions such as biting and chewing. Upon the onset of headache in migraines, the <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3274576/">trigeminal nerve will release a chemical called calcitonin gene-related peptide</a> (CGRP). CGRP will relax the blood vessel walls causing vasodilation.</p>
<h3><strong>What are the treatments?</strong></h3>
<p>Finding effective treatments for migraine has been a challenge. Fifteen years ago, <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.2165/11537990-000000000-00000">triptans</a> represented an important step toward migraine attack resolution and symptomatic treatment. Triptans are drugs which bind to and activate specific serotonin receptors called 5-HT<sub>1B</sub> and 5-HT<sub>1D</sub>.</p>
<p><sub> </sub>Activating these receptors with triptans can have multiple effects. Triptans can impact trigeminal nerves involved in pain by decreasing the release of CGRP and substance P, a chemical known for its pain producing properties. Triptans can also modulate the activity of certain brain areas and induce vasoconstriction.</p>
<p>Five years ago <a href="https://bpspubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/epdf/10.1111/bph.12763">botulin toxin</a>, also known as BoTox®, was introduced as the first treatment for chronic migraine. BoTox® is usually thought of as a substance used for cosmetic surgery, but there is also evidence for its clinical potential. Botulin toxin may help headaches through multiple mechanisms. One mechanism describes how upon injection botulin toxin is taken up by cranial nerves in the face and travels up the trigeminal nerve into the central nervous system. Botulin toxin then reduces inflammation and inhibits the release of CGRP.</p>

BoTox® is usually thought of as a substance used for cosmetic surgery, but there is also evidence for its clinical potential.</p></blockquote>
<p>The next milestone in migraine treatment arrived with the approval of <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5486583/pdf/11940_2017_Article_463.pdf">CGRP monoclonal antibody therapy</a>. Monoclonal antibody therapy involves the creation of antibodies that bind to a specific protein, in this case CGRP, or its receptor. When antibodies bind to these proteins or receptors it inactivates them. By inactivating CGRP, vasodilation caused by this molecule can be prevented.</p>
<p>Promising non-pharmacological therapeutic options are currently being assessed, but need to be validated. Noninvasive neurostimulation techniques, such as noninvasive vagal nerve stimulation, have shown potential in resolving migraine attack. Noninvasive vagal nerve stimulation involves the stimulation of the vagal nerve via a device that is placed on the skin of your neck.</p>
<p>Other non-pharmacological approaches, such as physical exercise or acupuncture, has demonstrated efficacy in small groups of patients and are worthy of further development through controlled trials.</p>
<p>There is a continual search for the various structural and functional abnormalities in the brain which generate such incredibly painful and debilitating events. Our knowledge on pathophysiology and therapeutic strategies is increasing over time, but the challenge of present and future studies is the improvement of migraine management to avoid the evolution toward a chronic form.</p>

<img alt="" class="attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image" height="110" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2018/08/man-2814937_1920-140x110.jpg" style="display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;" width="140" /><p>At first glance, language and evolution seem to have very few things in common. Closer inspection shows, however, that the three parts that form the core of evolution–variation, heritability and change-causing forces (e.g. selection)–are also found in language.</p>
<p>Similarities between linguistic and biological evolution, already noticed by <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/2300/pg2300-images.html">Darwin</a> and elaborated on by a number of <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nrg2560">scholars</a> since then, have enabled the plausible usage of modern methods of evolutionary biology to analyze language data.</p>
<blockquote><p>Similarities between linguistic and biological evolution, have enabled the plausible usage of modern methods of evolutionary biology to analyze language data.</p></blockquote>
<p>The majority of this work has focused on constructing phylogenies of the <a href="https://muse.jhu.edu/article/576998">Indo-European</a>, <a href="http://science.sciencemag.org/content/323/5913/479">Austronesian</a> and <a href="https://benjamins.com/catalog/dia.30.3.02syr">Uralic</a> language families. These phylogenies in turn are used to study the taxonomy or the dispersal histories of these groups.</p>
<p>In these studies, languages are paralleled with species. Due to the hierarchical nature of both entities, it is also possible to parallel the substructures–i.e dialects and populations–with each other and apply population genetic methods to dialect data. The applicability of these methods on dialect data has been <a href="http://booksandjournals.brillonline.com/content/journals/10.1163/22105832-00602002">shown in the earlier work</a> of our <a href="http://www.bedlan.net">research group</a>.</p>
<p>In our current work, we have combined biology and linguistics one step further. Instead of only adopting methods from population genetics, we have also utilized certain elements of the biological microevolutionary framework.</p>
<p>We aimed to advance the present understanding of linguistic divergence, a process which has had an important role in the emergence of the over <a href="https://www.ethnologue.com/">7000 languages</a> that exist in the world today.</p>
<p>In biology, species divergence can be investigated at the early phases of the divergence process, which involves the separation of populations within a species. In our current study we examined linguistic divergence by focusing on the initial phase of the process: the divergence of dialects within a language.</p>
<blockquote><p>In biology, species divergence can be investigated at the early phases of the divergence process, which involves the separation of populations within a species.</p></blockquote>
<p>We took hypotheses from both biological and linguistic literature. Firstly, we studied the role of geographical distance, as it contributes to the divergence of both populations and dialects. In general, the further away the groups are from each other, the less balancing dispersal there is between them, and the more different they turn out to be.</p>
<p>Secondly, we adopted the biological hypothesis of <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/evo.12258">isolation by environment</a> to investigated whether mere differences in environmental conditions can isolate groups of speakers and have a role in the divergence of dialects.</p>
<p>Finally, we considered whether linguistic differences can be explained by cultural differences. Culture and specifically its cumulativeness is a special feature of the human species.</p>
<h3><strong>100 years of linguistic variations in Finland</strong></h3>
<p>We studied the divergence of dialects of the Finnish language. We used a dataset describing the linguistic variation of Finnish approximately one hundred years ago (Fig 1). The data is from a time when the differences between dialects were still very clear, as urbanization took place in Finland relatively late.</p>

<p>As we were interested in differences between dialect groups, we used a population genetic clustering method to infer those groups. To achieve this, we organised the linguistic data in a similar way to genetic data.</p>
<p>In biology, the individual is the unit of study, and within them, alleles of certain loci are the topic of interest. In the dialect data, we were interested in the local variants of certain linguistic features within a local administrative unit (i.e. municipality). Thus, we paralleled individuals with municipalities, loci with linguistic features, and alleles with local variants of these linguistic features.</p>
<p>From Finland, there also exists old records of the spatial distribution of various cultural and environmental features. Comparatively, Finland is an environmentally and culturally homogenous country, and hence we were able to study whether small differences in the environmental and cultural conditions may already be connected with linguistic divergence</p>
<p>To our surprise, we found that geographical distance explained the least of the linguistic differences between the dialect groups. In other words, dialects spoken geographically close to each other may remain linguistically very different.</p>
<p>While cultural differences explained the majority of the linguistic differences, environmental differences also explained more than just geographical distance. The extent of the roles played by both environment and culture is a remarkable finding, as it suggests that human cultural adaptation may have had a role in the divergence of the Finnish dialects.</p>
<p>We formulated a hypothesis that  human’s capability for cultural adaptation in response to different environmental conditions may contribute to the divergence of dialects. While more research on this subject is needed, our study introduces interesting new perspectives on how global linguistic diversity could have taken shape.</p>

<p>If you contemplate how a person’s life would be changed by starting to hear or see things others can’t, can you imagine it could offer anything good? A research team from Hull university and the surrounding NHS trusts suggest that among the tumult, hallucinations can also offer opportunities for growth. Writing <a href="https://www.omicsonline.org/open-access/a-weird-but-interesting-journey-personal-traumatic-growth-for-individuals-with-hallucinations-2161-0487-1000343-102910.html">in the Journal of Psychology and Psychotherapy</a>, lead author Lily Dixon and her team detail the experiences of seven people who have lived with verbal or auditory hallucinations and how, amid the struggles, their journeys have taken them to some positive places.</p>
<p><span id="more-34694"></span></p>
<p>The five men and two women, aged 28 to 53, were recruited from mental health services. Some had begun experiencing hallucinations in childhood, others later in life. The researchers interviewed them about how the experience had affected them and their relationships, the challenges they had faced, and what they expected from the future.</p>
<p>The interviewees were united in seeing the arrival of their hallucinations as an unwelcome shock. They were something to be hidden so as to avoid stigma. “I don’t want to accept it’s schizophrenia because it will always be branded, I’ll always be branded with that name, and if you tell anyone you’ve got schizophrenia they automatically think that you’re a mental case and that you’re going to kill them,” said one interviewee. Some felt that to remain themselves, the experience needed rejecting – “I’m trying to separate the person, I like the person that I am when I’m not hearing voices.” A commonly held early belief was that getting better meant reducing or eliminating the hallucinations. Blur out the visions, silence the voices.</p>
<p>But, over time, the interviewees found their focus had shifted. “Steve” (real names are not used in the paper) reported an event that stuck in his head: “I remember being at my best friend’s house and she said ‘well why don’t you just talk to them’ y’know the voices, rather than sitting around or arguing, so I did and I spoke to them so I went ‘hello’ and they go ‘oh hello you finally talking to us’ and I was like what?!”</p>
<p>Making that step from denial and conflict to engagement had consequences for Steve, who felt that “they’re more helpful now than disturbing… it’s like I’ve got a lot of friends I talk to every day.”</p>
<p>Others echoed this idea that when the hallucinatory experiences were faced, rather than fended off, the possibility of value could emerge. So much so that the prospect of shedding them no longer felt like a cure. “A lot of people say what if I could change things but I’m not sure I would, y’know, if, I’ve just learnt to accept that it’s part of me now,” said one interviewee. Another said that without his hallucinations, he would feel “hollow”.</p>
<p>Exactly what good could come from hallucinations? The answers were hard to pin down, as no interviewee felt they were an unalloyed good, and did not want to tempt fate through naive optimism. One note was the self-fortification that comes from continuous battle – “Debbie” said tentatively “I haven’t let it beat me… it’s made me more tougher… the voice has given me more strength, and it’s it’s sort of like, made me into the person I am, stronger.”</p>
<p>Another positive thread was that the hallucinations brokered a change in perspective towards others, and even toward experience itself. “I show more empathy maybe, more than I used to” said one interviewee, while another described how “it’s changed the way I see others, think about other attitudes and the way I’ve seen myself.”</p>
<p>“Paul’s” particularly self-scrutinising comment gives a more expansive take: “I think I’d have been a lot more destructive rather than constructive if I maybe wasn’t hearing or seeing things… I think it’s changed my outlook on, on certain things, y’know, of just sometimes learning to sit and watch the world go by, rather than, trying to beat the world.”</p>
<p>What facilitated this apparent journey from dismay to bittersweet growth? The reports suggested that belonging and acceptance had been critical, especially emotional support, simply to have had “somebody listening”. But the journey sometimes also required movement against prevailing winds: one interviewee counselled “don’t give up on wanting to become yourself, rather than your society or whatever, forget all of them forget everything else, you’ve got to be comfortable with yourself.”</p>
<p>The quality of the services available was also crucial: clinicians offering alarm and stigma were seen as a common obstacle. The support that seemed most useful was based on the introduction of techniques like mindfulness and relaxation, and engagement with the <a href="https://www.hearing-voices.org/">Hearing Voices network</a>, as this showed that “you’re not on your own”. This normalisation and engagement meant that having an atypical experience of reality no longer sundered the interviewees from society, but offered a different role where that experience had a part to play.</p>
<p>This isn’t a simple story. Participants continued to see their hallucinations as something that hindered, only now tempered by the possibility to enrich. Dixon’s team recommend that professionals, friends and family who are close to people having such experiences, and particularly clinicians, should avoid stigmatisation and support them wherever they are at, understanding that a complex relationship with reality does not make the person any less whole.</p>

One paper was retracted, another received an outrageous correction.

The model is described in a book (<a href="https://www.lehigh.edu/~mhb0/AIFull.pdf">Bickhard and Tervenn, 1996</a>) and a more recent review (<a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11229-008-9375-x">Bickhard 2008</a>).</p>
<p>It starts with a criticism of what Bickhard calls “encodingism”, the idea that mental representations are constituted by encodings, correspondences between things in the world and symbols (this is very similar to <a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2018/07/13/168237">my criticism of the neural coding metaphor</a>, except Bickhard’s angle is cognitive science while mine was neuroscience). The basic argument is that the encoding “crosses the boundary of the epistemic agent”: the perceptual system stands on only one side of the correspondence, so there is no way it can interpret symbols in terms of things in the world since it never has access to things in the world at any point. The interpretation of the symbols in terms of things in the world would require an interpreter, some entity that makes sense of <em>a priori</em> arbitrary symbols. But this was precisely the epistemic problem to be solved, so the interpreter is a homunculus and this is an incoherent view. This is related to the skeptic argument about knowledge: there cannot be valid knowledge since we acquire knowledge by our senses and we cannot step outside of ourselves to check that it is valid. Encodingism fails the skeptic objection. Note that Bickhard refutes neither the possibility of representations nor even the possibility of encodings, but rather the fact that encodings can be foundational of representations. There can be derivative encodings, based on existing representations (for example Morse is a derivative encoding, which presupposes that we know about both letters and dots and dashes).</p>
<p>A key feature that a representational system must have is what Bickhard calls “system-detectable errors”. A representational system must be able to test whether its representations are correct or not. This is not possible in encodingism because the system does not have access to what is being represented (knowledge that cannot be checked is what I called “metaphysical knowledge” in my <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1311.3129">Subjective physics</a> paper). No learning is possible if there are no system-detectable errors. This is the problem of normativity.</p>
<p>The interactivist model proposes the following solution: representations are anticipations of potential interactions and their expected impact on future states of the systems, or on the future course of processes of the system (this is close to Gibson’s “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affordance">affordances</a>”). I give an example taken from <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1311.3129">Subjective physics</a>. Consider a sound source located somewhere in space. What does it mean to know where the sound came from? In the encoding view, we would say that the system has a mapping between the angle of the source and properties of the sounds, and so it infers the source’s angle from the captured sounds. But what can this mean? Is the inferred angle in radians or degrees? Surely radians and degrees cannot make sense for the perceiver and cannot have been learned (this is what I called “metaphysical knowledge”), so in fact the representation cannot actually be in the form of the physical angle of the source. Rather, what it means that the source is at a given position is that (for example) you would expect that moving your eyes in a particular way would make the source appear in your fovea (see more detail about the Euclidean structure of space and related topics in <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1311.3129">Subjective physics</a>). Thus, the notion of space is a representation of the expected consequences of certain types of actions.</p>
<p>The interactivist model of representations has the desirable property that it has system-detectable errors: a representation can be correct or not, depending on whether the anticipation turns out to be correct or not. Importantly, what is anticipated is internal states, and therefore the representation does not cross the boundary of the epistemic agent. Contrary to standard models of representation, the interactivist model successfully addresses the skeptic argument.</p>
<p>The interactivist model is described at a rather abstract level, often referring to abstract machine theory (states of automata). Thus, it leaves aside the problem of its naturalization: how is it instantiated by the brain? Important questions to address are: what is a ‘state’ of the brain? (in particular given that the brain is a continuously active dynamical system where no “end state” can be identified); how do we cope with its distributed nature, that is, that the epistemic agent is itself constituted of a web of interacting elementary epistemic agents? how are representations built and instantiated?</p>

<p>From an evolutionary perspective, altruistic behaviour is still a bit of mystery to psychologists, especially when it comes with a hefty cost to the self and is aimed at complete strangers.</p>
<p>One explanation is that altruism is driven by empathy – experiencing other people’s distress the same way as, or similar to, how we experience our own. However, others have criticized this account – most notably psychologist Paul Bloom, author of <em>Against Empathy: The Case for Rational Compassion</em>. Their reasons are many, but among them is the fact that our empathy tends to be greatest for people who are most similar to us, which would argue against empathy driving the kind of altruism that involves the giver making personal sacrifices for strangers.</p>
<p>Hindering research into this topic is the challenge of measuring empathy objectively and devising a reliable laboratory measure of altruism (including one that overcomes most volunteers’ natural inclination to want to present themselves as morally good).</p>
<p>A <a href="http://journals.sagepub.com/eprint/zW2hJbfmcxUEc6Isa4iN/full">new study</a> in <em>Psychological Science</em> overcomes these obstacles by using a neural measure of empathy and by testing a rare group of people whose altruistic credentials are second to none: individuals who have donated one of their kidneys to a complete stranger.</p>
<p><span id="more-34660"></span></p>
<p>The findings suggest that – at least for this group of “extraordinary altruists” – empathy for others may be a relevant driving force. Compared with demographically matched controls, the altruists showed a greater amount of overlap in the neural activity they exhibited during their first-hand experience of pain and when observing a stranger in pain.</p>
<p>The US research team, led by Kristen Brethel-Haurwitz at the University of Pennsylvania, invited the 25 kidney donors and the 27 controls to their lab and had them complete various sessions in the brain scanner, during which they either experienced painful pressure applied to their own thumb, or they witnessed a live video feed of a previously unfamiliar study partner (actually a research confederate) suffering the same pain. For comparison, some sessions for both the participant and their partner were completely safe and pain-free, allowing the researchers to investigate brain activity during experienced pain, the anticipation of possible pain, and during safety.</p>
<p>At a group level, the altruists exhibited greater neural overlap while experiencing pain and while witnessing a stranger in pain, including in the left anterior insular, putamen, thalamus, prefrontal cortex and cingulate cortex (all known areas of the brain’s “pain matrix”). The altruists also showed greater neural overlap when anticipating pain themselves and when anticipating that their partner would experience it. These group contrasts are despite the altruists and controls showing comparable average patterns of neural activation when experiencing pain, or the threat of it, themselves.</p>
<p>At an individual level, for the altruists but not the controls, the neural activation they showed in the left anterior insular while in pain correlated with the amount of activation they showed in that same region when observing their partner in pain.</p>
<p>Moreover, the researchers also looked at neural connectivity patterns, finding that the altruists displayed greater functional connectivity between pain-related neural regions during first-hand pain and when observing another in pain, as compared with the controls.</p>
<p>The psychological relevance of the neural findings were supported by the fact the altruists expressed a greater sense of inclusion of their partner in their sense of self (than did the controls), and this sense of closeness appeared to mediate at least some of the neural overlap they exhibited between first-hand and empathic pain.</p>
<p>In contrast to the neural data, the “inclusion in self” scores, and the super-altruists’ history of organ donation, the controls rated themselves just as empathic as did the super altruistic kidney donors, which surely places a question mark over the validity of much of the existing literature in this field that has relied on such self-rating measures.</p>
<p>The researchers acknowledged that their findings may not generalise to less exceptionally altruistic people. However, they believe their work demonstrates an important point that will inform the debate about the role of empathy in altruism. “That altruists, relative to controls, exhibit enhanced self-other mapping for strangers’ distress – ordinarily observed only in response to close others – supports the hypothesis that empathic biases against distant or dissimilar others can be overcome,” they said, “and that, ultimately, empathy can support the provision of costly altruism.”</p>

<p>Being rich(er) may not guarantee happiness, as shown by <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B004TRQAS6/ref=dp-kindle-redirect?_encoding=UTF8&amp;btkr=1">ample evidence from the social sciences</a>, but there are ways of spending money that will make you happier than others. Recent research has uncovered the “<a href="http://psycnet.apa.org/record/2003-10055-017">experiential advantage</a>”: greater happiness from spending money on experiences (holidays, meals, theatre tickets) instead of material things (gadgets, clothes, jewellery). This could be for a number of reasons, such as experiences being more closely aligned with our values and being less likely to produce rumination and regret. There are exceptions to this rule, of course. Studies have found that personality traits can influence whether experiences or things make a person happiest; for example, <a href="http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0956797616635200?journalCode=pssa">introverts are made much happier by spending vouchers in a bookshop than a bar</a>.</p>
<p>Another likely exception, that hasn’t previously been studied, is how social class, and specifically access to resources, affects this experiential advantage. Indeed, most research in this area has been performed with college students, who are typically more affluent than the general population, and there are reasons to believe that those who are less well-off might prefer material goods. For them, buying things as opposed to experiences could be more practical: they last longer, can be used multiple times and potentially resold in the future. To put this reasoning to the test, a <a href="http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0956797617736386">recent paper</a> in <i>Psychological Science</i> investigated whether the experiential advantage is diminished or absent for people who can afford very little compared with those who can afford a lot.</p>
<p><span id="more-34656"></span></p>
<p>Jacob Lee and colleagues began by assessing the social status of hundreds of US citizens – most of them recruited via Amazon’s survey website – using the MacArthur Scale of Subjective Social Status, a ladder with 10 rungs representing relative social standing. At the top are people with the most money, most education and most respected jobs, while the bottom rung represents the worst off in society. Participants indicate where on this ladder they sit, which has been shown to be often more accurate than objective indicators of class, like income and education.</p>
<p>In the first experiment, participants recalled recent experiential and material purchases, and rated which one made them happier on a scale from -3 (definitely experiential purchase) to 3 (definitely object purchase). As predicted, those on a lower “rung” of the social ladder reported greater happiness from purchasing objects, while their higher-class counterparts were made happier by experiences.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>In a second experiment, participants were randomly assigned to think of either a recent material or experiential purchase they had made and rate how happy it made them. Again, there was a significant interaction between class and purchase type, with an experiential advantage for higher-class participants. Happiness did not vary by purchase type for the lower-class participants.</p>
<p>In their third and final experiment, the researchers manipulated feelings of affluence to demonstrate a causal effect of social class on the pleasure derived from different purchase types. Participants first recalled a recent material and experiential purchase. Then, half of the participants imagined their monthly income had increased by 50 per cent, while the other half imagined theirs had decreased by 50 per cent. To bring this hypothetical situation to life, the researchers also asked the participants to spend time thinking about how they would allocate their budget with this new income, and how financially comfortable or constrained they would feel.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Finally, the participants rated their comparative happiness from an experiential or material purchase. Crucially, this was either the two purchases they had recalled at the beginning of the task, or two imagined purchases they would make now (with their new income). In this way, the researchers were able to demonstrate the difference between the purchase types when participants were primed to feel richer or poorer. Sure enough, there was<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>an experiential advantage in the resource-abundant condition, and a trend towards material purchases in the deprivation condition, although this did not reach statistical significance. These findings are important because they imply a causal effect of access to resources: regardless of existing income, increasing or reducing an individual’s perception of their financial stability affected what type of purchase made them happier.</p>
<p>One underlying factor that could contribute to this effect is the amount of time available for experiences. It seems likely that more affluent individuals will have more free time or paid leave as well as disposable income, compared to those working several minimum-wage jobs to make ends meet. This could affect how appealing different purchase types are to both groups, an interpretation supported by lower social class participants in the current studies reporting a lower tendency to make experiential purchases than their higher-class peers.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>This introduces the possibility that experiential purchases designed to create extra leisure time, like hiring a cleaner or having the groceries delivered, could be especially valued by the less well-off, building on recent research by Ashley Whillans and colleagues<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>that suggested <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2016/02/04/people-who-prioritise-time-over-money-are-happier/">people who prioritise time over money are happier</a> and that <a href="http://www.pnas.org/content/114/32/8523">making time-saving purchases has a positive impact on wellbeing</a>.</p>
<p>The most obvious limitation of the new research is its reliance on recall tasks. Memory is fallible and we are notoriously bad at knowing what makes us happy, so future studies would benefit from measuring happiness before and after participants make actual purchases of either type. It’s telling that in Whillans’ time-saving research, very few respondents chose to allocate money to save time, despite the results showing that doing so had the greatest impact on happiness. This implies we can’t necessarily rely on the purchases people make, or what they think about them, as an indicator for what is best for wellbeing.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>For now, this new research adds further nuance to our understanding of the complex relationship between money, purchases and happiness, suggesting that what makes you happiest could depend on anything from your income to your personality type to your amount of free time.</p>

<p><strong>Science Without Publication Paywalls: cOAlition S for the Realisation of Full and Immediate Open Access</strong></p>
<p>Marc Schiltz<sup>1</sup>*</p>
<p><sup>1</sup> President, Science Europe, Brussels, Belgium</p>
<p>* <a href="mailto:Marc.Schiltz@fnr.lu">Marc.Schiltz@fnr.lu</a></p>
<p>In this Perspective, a group of national funders, joined by the European Commission and the European Research Council, announce plans to make Open Access publishing mandatory for recipients of their agencies’ research funding.</p>
<p><strong>Open Access is Foundational to the Scientific Enterprise</strong></p>
<p>Universality is a fundamental principle of science (the term ‘science’ as used here includes the humanities): only results that can be discussed, challenged, and, where appropriate, tested and reproduced by others qualify as scientific. Science, as an institution of <em>organised criticism</em>, can therefore only function properly if research results are made openly available to the community so that they can be submitted to the test and scrutiny of other researchers. Furthermore, new research builds on established results from previous research. The chain, whereby new scientific discoveries are built on previously established results, can only work optimally if all research results are made openly available to the scientific community.</p>
<p>Publication paywalls are withholding a substantial amount of research results from a large fraction of the scientific community and from society as a whole. This constitutes an absolute anomaly, which hinders the scientific enterprise in its very foundations and hampers its uptake by society. Monetising the access to new and existing research results is profoundly at odds with the ethos of science [1]. There is no longer any justification for this state of affairs to prevail and the subscription-based model of scientific publishing, including its so-called ‘hybrid’ variants, should therefore be terminated. In the 21st century, science publishers should provide a service to help researchers disseminate their results. They may be paid fair value for the services they are providing, but <strong>no science should be locked behind paywalls!</strong></p>
<p><strong>A Decisive Step Towards the Realisation of Full Open Access Needs to be Taken Now</strong></p>
<p>Researchers and research funders have a collective duty of care for the science system as a whole. The 2003 <em>Berlin Declaration</em> [2] was a strong manifestation of the science community (researchers and research funders united) to regain ownership of the rules governing the dissemination of scientific information. Science Europe established principles for the transition to Open Access in 2013 [3] but wider overall progress has been slow. In 2016, the EU Ministers of science and innovation, assembled in the Competitiveness Council, resolved that all European scientific publications should be immediately accessible by 2020.</p>
<p>As major public funders of research in Europe, we have a duty of care for the good functioning of the science system (of which we are part), as well as a fiduciary responsibility for the proper usage of the public funds that we are entrusted with. As university and library negotiation teams in several countries (e.g. Germany, France, Sweden) [4,5] are struggling to reach agreements with large publishing houses, we feel that a decisive move towards the realisation of Open Access and the complete elimination of publication paywalls in science should be taken now. The appointment of the Open Access Envoy by the European Commission has accelerated this process.</p>
<p>Hence, driven by our duty of care for the proper functioning of the science system, we have developed<strong> Plan S </strong>whereby <strong>research funders will mandate that access to research publications that are generated through research grants that they allocate, must be fully and immediately open and cannot be monetised in any way </strong>(Box 1)<strong>.</strong></p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>Box 1. Plan S. Accelerating the transition to full and immediate Open Access to scientific publications.</strong></p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<table width="100%">
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>The key principle is as follows:<p></p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>“After 1 January 2020 scientific publications on the results from research funded by public grants provided by national and European research councils and funding bodies, must be published in compliant Open Access Journals or on compliant Open Access Platforms.” </strong></p>
<p> </p>
<p>In addition:</p>
<p>–                Authors retain copyright of their publication with no restrictions. All publications must be published under an open license, preferably the Creative Commons Attribution Licence CC BY. In all cases, the license applied should fulfil the requirements defined by the Berlin declaration;</p>
<p>–                The Funders will ensure jointly the establishment of robust criteria and requirements for the services that compliant high quality Open Access journals and Open Access platforms must provide;</p>
<p>–                In case such high quality Open Access journals or platforms do not yet exist, the Funders will in a coordinated way provide incentives to establish these and support them when appropriate; support will also be provided for Open Access infrastructures where necessary;</p>
<p>–                Where applicable, Open Access publication fees are covered by Funders or universities, not by individual researchers; it is acknowledged that all scientists should be able to publish their work Open Access even if their institutions have limited means;</p>
<p>–                When Open Access publication fees are applied, their funding is standardised and capped (across Europe);</p>
<p>–                Funders will ask universities, research organisations, and libraries to align their policies and strategies, notably to ensure transparency;</p>
<p>–                The above principles shall apply to all types of scholarly publications, but it is understood that the timeline to achieve Open Access for monographs and books may be longer than 1 January 2020;</p>
<p>–                The importance of open archives and repositories for hosting research outputs is acknowledged because of their long-term archiving function and their potential for editorial innovation;</p>
<p>–                The ‘hybrid’ model of publishing is not compliant with the above principles;</p>
<p>–                The Funders will monitor compliance and will sanction non-compliance.</p></td>

<p><strong>Further Considerations</strong></p>
<p>We recognise that researchers need to be given a maximum of freedom to choose the proper venue for publishing their results and that in some jurisdictions this freedom may be covered by a legal or constitutional protection. However, our collective duty of care is for the science system as a whole, and researchers must realise that they are doing a gross disservice to the institution of science if they continue to report their outcomes in publications that will be locked behind paywalls.</p>
<p>We also understand that researchers may be driven to do so by a misdirected reward system which puts emphasis on the wrong indicators (<em>e.g</em>. journal impact factor). We therefore commit to fundamentally revise the incentive and reward system of science, using the San Francisco <em>Declaration</em> on Research Assessment (DORA) [6] as a starting point.</p>
<p>The subscription-based model of scientific publishing emerged at a certain point in the history of science, when research papers needed extensive typesetting, layout design, printing, and when hardcopies of journals needed to be distributed throughout the world. While moving from print to digital, the publishing process still needs services, but the distribution channels have been completely transformed. There is no valid reason to maintain any kind of subscription-based business model for scientific publishing in the digital world, where Open Access dissemination is maximising the impact, visibility, and efficiency of the whole research process. Publishers should provide services that help scientists to review, edit, disseminate, and interlink their work and they may charge fair value for these services in a transparent way. The minimal standards for services expected from publishers are laid down on page 6 of the 2015 ‘Science Europe Principles on Open Access Publisher Services’ [3].</p>
<p>Obviously, our call for <em>immediate</em> Open Access is not compatible with any type of embargo period.</p>
<p>We acknowledge that ‘transformative’ type of agreements, where subscription fees are offset against publication fees, may contribute to accelerate the transition to full Open Access. Therefore, it is acceptable that, during a transition period that should be as short as possible, individual funders may continue to tolerate publications in ‘hybrid’ journals that are covered by such a ‘transformative’ type of agreement. There should be complete transparency in such agreements and their terms and conditions should be fully and publicly disclosed.</p>
<p>We are aware that there may be attempts to misuse the Open Access model of publishing by publishers that provide poor or non-existent editorial services (<em>e.g</em>. the so-called ‘predatory’ publishers). We will therefore support initiatives that establish robust quality criteria for Open Access publishing, such as the Directory of Open Access Journals (DOAJ) (<a href="https://doaj.org">https://doaj.org</a>) and the Directory of Open Access Books (DOAB) (<a href="https://www.doabooks.org">https://www.doabooks.org</a>).</p>
<p>We note that for monographs and books the transition to Open Access may be longer than 1 January 2020, but as short as possible and respecting the targets already set by the individual research funders.</p>
<p><strong>cOAlition S: Building an Alliance of Funders and Stakeholders</strong></p>
<p>Plan S states the fundamental principles for future Open Access publishing. Science Europe, funders, the European Research Council and the European Commission will work together to clarify and publish implementation details. The plan does not advocate any particular Open Access business model, although it is clear that some of the current models are not compliant. We therefore invite publishers to switch to publication models that comply with these principles.</p>
<p>Plan S was initiated by the Open Access Envoy of the European Commission and further developed by the President of Science Europe and by a group of Heads of national funding organisations. It also drew on substantial input from the Scientific Council of the European Research Council.</p>
<p>Today, a group of national funders initiate the alliance cOAlition S (<a href="http://scieur.org/coalition-s">http://scieur.org/coalition-s</a>) to take action towards the implementation of Plan S, and are joined by the European Commission and the European Research Council.</p>
<p>We invite other funding agencies and research councils, as well as stakeholders (notably researchers, universities, libraries, and publishers) to join cOAlition S and thereby contribute to the swift realisation of our vision of science without publication paywalls.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://forgingconnectionsblog.wordpress.com/2018/09/04/poster-perfection/">Poster Perfection</a></h4>

<p>This is the latest in the blog series co-authored by myself and the wonderful <a href="https://twitter.com/SueReviews">Sue Fletcher-Watson</a>. After a brief hiatus we are back with our latest post – how to put together a great poster. Designing an attractive and informative poster is an incredibly useful skill, especially for early-career researchers. For any non-academic readers – most academic conferences and often internal events at Universities will have a poster session.  These allow more people to share their research findings, in addition to scheduled speakers. So posters matter, but in our experience there is surprisingly little guidance given on how to do them well. So here are our dos and don’ts of putting together a killer poster.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Plan ahead </strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Putting together a great poster takes some time and you will need to factor in a few days to get it printed as well. So plan ahead. In our experience people leave posters to the absolute last minute (you know who you are). The result is usually something that looks haphazard and counterintuitive. There is also that mad panic and rush to the print shop…which is never open when you need it to be… and then you almost miss your flight… which is always best avoided.</p>
<p>Make sure you check whether it needs to be landscape or portrait, and what size the presentation boards will be.  You don’t want a poster that’s too big for your board! The conference organisers will be able to tell you this.</p>
<p>A great poster is something you can come back to many times – it can be easily shared online, re-used at multiple events, and it might end up being displayed on your department walls – so it is worth doing well. When done properly, a poster should be easy to present, easy on the eye and it may even win you a prize or two J. So plan it properly.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>You can only tell one good story with a poster </strong></li>
</ul>
<p>In a paper you may have 2 or 3 ongoing stories, or main findings that the manuscript is constructed around. This doesn’t work for a poster. A poster needs a single key message that you want to get across. Make sure that this features in the title. We both prefer titles that convey the story or finding you’re reporting on, rather than emphasising the method or approach.</p>
<p>People will only be at your poster for a few minutes (at best). You might not be there or available to explain it to them. It will likely be crowded and noisy. All of this means that you need to boil down the message to a single narrative and explain it well in a few points. When Sue does a poster, she always tries to have two or three bullet points that set out the essential background and central research question.  These are matched with two or three bullets to summarise the conclusions.  It should be possible to understand the study by reading just these sections.  The viewer can quickly and easily decide if they want to linger by your poster board, to get more detail on methods or results. The first step in designing a great poster is choosing this central narrative and presenting it neatly and briefly.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Select the key pieces of information, and make them pop</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Avoid large amounts of text. Graphics are a great way of conveying a lot of information in a small space. Don’t just paste in figures from your paper: these will probably need amending or focussing to fit the tight narrative that you have adopted for the poster.</p>
<p>Think about what will be central – literally, right in the middle – in your poster. This is the prime space for key graphics and findings. Construct the rest of the poster around this. You can also use colour to make sure important details are easy for the reader to spot. If you’re using, say, navy blue text on an off-white background, maybe you could reverse these colours for your conclusions so that they stand out from the main text?</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Imagine you are there… what visual aids would help?</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Trial run your poster. You would never imagine giving a talk that you hadn’t practiced (would you?!), and you need to apply the same logic to your posters. Show lab mates or departmental colleagues who are not familiar with your study. Can you use the poster to explain the study in about 3 minutes? Are there visual aids or diagrams that might help? Going through this process is vital to make sure that your poster actually works.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Don’t be constrained by the template</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Many institutions have set templates which are approved by corporate people somewhere (I guess). Our advice is to not let this constrain how you display your poster. You are the person who will have to stand next to this thing and use it. As long as you have the right logos and basic palette, and it is otherwise a brilliant poster, you should get away with it. And this is far preferable to a poster structure that simply doesn’t work. A common poster template is a landscape organised into three columns.  If you add information to these in a traditional sequence of background – research question – methods – results – discussion, you can often end up with interesting graphs at the bottom or off to one side. Don’t be afraid of going a little off-piste if this helps you get your message across. We won’t tell corporate if you don’t…</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>If you don’t have an eye for colour then ask someone who does </strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Finally, if you have bad taste when it comes to colours (again… you know who you are) then ask someone to help you. Try and avoid clashing colour combos, needlessly vivid and flashy figures. Posters are an inherently visual medium, so get the colours right. Think about what logos you have to have on the poster, and pick a palette which compliments at least one of them.  An easy fix is to go with different shades of the same colour – blues and greens work well – rather than mixing up your colours too much.</p>
<p>To round this off, here is a <a href="http://dart.ed.ac.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/SFW-IMFAR-clickeast-v2-small.pdf">poster</a> – this one made by Sue which she is pretty pleased with.</p>
<p>And there you have it. Investing time to make the poster good is worth it. You will enjoy the conference much more, you might win a prize, and it will look great on the lab wall once you’re done. <strong>So plan ahead, focus the message, get some good graphics… and be a great scientist! </strong></p>

People become less approving of social media outrage the more people join in with it. One person rebuking another is fine, but ten people doing it looks like a mob.

This is the key finding of an interesting new paper called The Paradox of Viral Outrage, from Takuya Sawaoka and Benoît Monin of Stanford.

According to the authors, the titular 'paradox' is that "individual outrage that would be praised in isolation is more likely to be viewed as bullying when echoed online by a multitude of si

<p>In the UK, this has been a year of action on the gender pay gap (the, on average, lower pay for women compared with men), with cross-party MPs launching campaigns like <a href="https://paymetoo.com/">#PayMeToo</a> and the government <a href="https://genderpaygap.campaign.gov.uk/">taking steps</a> to investigate and hold organisations to account on the issue. This has also <a href="https://www.personneltoday.com/hr/jordan-peterson-gender-pay-gap-exist/">attracted</a> <a href="https://iea.org.uk/gender-pay-gap-reporting-isnt-fit-for-purpose/">pushback</a> <a href="https://www.news.com.au/finance/work/careers/how-common-sense-shows-gender-pay-gap-is-a-myth/news-story/6f7f2be3ec8c56484f83b798ff6d548f">from</a> those that argue that the gender difference in average pay has many causes, including the different interests of, and life choices taken by, men and women. Now a study <a href="https://academic.oup.com/oep/advance-article/doi/10.1093/oep/gpy021/5046671">published in Oxford Economic Papers</a> has examined another complicating factor, namely whether the gender pay gap is influenced partly by an on-average difference between the genders in a trait not previously taken into account – the motivation to achieve.</p>
<p><span id="more-34654"></span></p>
<p>Leonora Risse and her team from Melbourne’s RMIT University drew on one year’s data from an Australian household survey of about 8,000 people employed full- or part-time. These workers provided information about their jobs, pay and social background, as well as completing a number of personality measures.</p>
<p>Risse’s team first analysed the pay data and found the usual gender gap suggesting women earned AUS $26 dollars an hour, on average, compared with<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>$32.50 an hour for men – a difference of nearly 20 per cent.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Next, the researchers looked into whether gender-linked personality differences could account for any of this difference, while holding other influences constant.</p>
<p>The classic connections drawn between personality and income are around two of the “Big Five” traits: people higher in conscientiousness – those who pay attention to quality and deadlines and work at a high pace – generally earn more, on average; as do people lower on agreeableness (suggesting there is an advantage for those more able and willing to make unlikeable decisions or put themselves before others).<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>As is typically seen when comparing the genders, women in this dataset were more agreeable, on average, and this appeared to adversely impact their pay. However they were also more conscientious, which offset things and meant that the net effect of gender differences in these Big Five traits was in explaining just nine cents of the gender pay gap.</p>
<p>But Risse’s team had their eye on another culprit: potential gender differences in a trait called “achievement motivation”, which is made up of the two sub-traits “fear of failure” and “hope for success”. People more motivated by a fear of failure act based on negative emotionality and women<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>typically score higher on this than men. Although fear of failure can propel people to get things done, it isn’t very effective at motivating them to take on new risks or seek opportunities, as this introduces further domains for failure. In contrast with this, the sub-trait “hope for success” drives people towards opportunities with the expectation they will turn out well – and men typically score higher on this trait than women.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Risse and her colleagues predicted gender differences in achievement motivation and its sub-traits would prove important for pay, as a jump forward in earnings often involves taking a risk – asking for a raise, taking a difficult assignment or switching roles or businesses. If men do these things more often – and are more confident when they do so – this could be a component of the gender pay gap.</p>
<p>As expected, in this dataset, women agreed more strongly with “fear of failure” items like “I am afraid of tasks that I cannot work out or solve”, while men agreed more strongly with “hope for success” items such as “I like situations where I can find out how capable I am”. Moreover, average gender differences in these traits contributed to the gender pay gap in the expected manner, together having twice the impact of the Big Five traits, at about 22 cents.</p>
<p>Sharp minds will notice that this means gender differences in the psychological measures accounted for 31 cents, which is only five per cent of the gender pay gap. Gender differences in workplace factors (e.g. the industries that men and women tend to work in, and whether in the private or public sector) made a far larger contribution to the pay gap (around 80 cents). In turn, workplace factors were overshadowed by average gender differences in age and experience – older people with more experience tend to earn more, and in this dataset, more men than women matched this description (accounting for two dollars of the gender pay gap). Average gender differences in skills had a still bigger impact: over $2.50 of the gap.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>So, the purely psychological measures turned out to be a bit player in this particular show. But drawing strong conclusions from this fact is difficult. One claim could be that social forces matter more than psychology: men are older in the workforce because of historical barriers to entry and because women who have children face more obstacles in returning to the workforce; skill differences reflect differential access to opportunities; and well-paying industries are not welcoming to women. But while there is considerable force to these social explanations, to view them as fully explaining the gender differences in occupational outcomes is likely to be ignoring other psychological features which weren’t measured in this study. Notably, the well-established gender differences in occupational interests, which <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2018/07/17/massive-study-finds-that-a-sizeable-minority-of-us-are-in-jobs-that-dont-fit-our-primary-occupational-interests/">while not deterministic</a>, remain an important driver of what choices people make around work, and the differences in how men and women construe <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2017/02/28/theres-a-psychological-case-for-paying-female-managers-more-than-male-managers-or-giving-them-more-holiday/">the trade off between pay and free time</a>.</p>
<p>This study wasn’t trying to provide us with all the answers. What it does show is clear: that, in aggregate, confidence in success and less fear of failure have real effects on wages, and that this may be relevant to the gender pay gap. One might expect that in certain roles and situations, gender differences in confidence could matter even more.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Based on their findings, Risse and her team suggest it may help reduce the gender pay gap for some women to undertake motivational and confidence training (although, as they note, personality is not infinitely malleable). The researchers also question whether there is a case for changing organisational cultures – is it necessarily a good thing for a <i>Yes I Can</i> mindset to so often be the one making it to the top? After all, sometimes that attitude can lead an organisation, or <a href="https://www.google.com/search?ei=D4-FW4OvG8fawQLTn6vwAQ&amp;q=2007+financial+crisis+risk+taking&amp;oq=2007+financial+crisis+risk+taking&amp;gs_l=psy-ab.3..33i22i29i30k1.79132.80058.0.80212.11.11.0.0.0.0.165.1219.2j8.10.0....0...1.1.64.psy-ab..1.10.1217...0i22i30k1.0.d-vjwBufB3A">a whole industry</a>, off a cliff.</p>

<img alt="" class="attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image" height="110" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2018/08/BF-140x110.jpg" style="display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;" width="140" /><p>Exclusive breastfeeding is known to have many health benefits for infants as they grow, including <a href="http://www.mdpi.com/2072-6643/10/8/995/htm" rel="noopener" target="_blank">reduced risk of asthma and other respiratory</a> and <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/apa.13132" rel="noopener" target="_blank">allergic conditions</a>.  Established risk factors for asthma include family history and male sex.  Use of antibiotics during pregnancy has been suggested as an additional risk factor, but there has been less evidence to support this possibility.</p>
<p>In a <a href="https://bmcpregnancychildbirth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12884-018-1936-5?utm_source=BMC_blog&amp;utm_medium=Blog&amp;utm_content=DavFal-BMC-BMC_Pregnancy_and_Childbirth-Public_Health-global&amp;utm_campaign=BMCS_USG_AUG2018_Benefits_of_breastfeeding" rel="noopener" target="_blank">new study</a> published in <a href="https://bmcpregnancychildbirth.biomedcentral.com/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><em>BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth</em></a>, Dr. Jun Zhang and colleagues at Shanghai Xinhua Hospital in China studied the interaction between the protective effect of breastfeeding and established risk factors.  In a case-control design, the authors interviewed the mothers of 634 children 3-12 years old diagnosed with asthma and mothers of 864 children of the same ages without asthma diagnosis or symptoms.</p>
<blockquote><p>Even among these higher-risk categories …, exclusive breastfeeding eliminated the increased risk associated with use of antibiotics.</p></blockquote>
<p>As expected, they found that half of the children with asthma had a family history compared to only 20% of the children without asthma.  They also found a higher prevalence of boys in the asthma group. Furthermore, they found that 7% of the asthma cases had been exposed to antibiotics during pregnancy compared to 3.5% of the controls supporting the hypothesis that antibiotic use is a risk factor for asthma in children.  The authors calculated that antibiotic use was associated with a 1.7 times increase in the risk of developing asthma.</p>
<p>When the authors divided the cases and controls by whether or not the children had been exclusively breastfed (EBF) for the first six months of life, the increased risk associated with use of antibiotics disappeared in the EBF group and increased to 2.6 times in the non-EBF group.</p>
<p>When dividing the children by sex and family history, antibiotic use was associated with a greater increased risk of asthma in boys and in those with family history (2.2 and 3.1 times higher risk respectively) than in the girls or those without family history.  Even among these higher-risk categories of antibiotics plus another risk factor, EBF eliminated the increased risk associated with use of antibiotics.</p>
<p>The large sample size and the diverse recruitment of the control group make this study very useful in the identification of both risk factors and protective practices for asthma.  Although antibiotics are often necessary to treat harmful infections that could seriously harm a pregnant woman or her fetus, this study highlights that potential risks need to be considered when prescribing antibiotics for less-serious infections.  Additionally, these findings call for studies to determine whether antibiotic type, duration, dosage, and time used during pregnancy affect the risks of children developing asthma.</p>
<p>There are growing efforts around the world to support women in breastfeeding, and the current findings showing that EBF in the first six months of life can attenuate increased asthma risk associated with antibiotic use in pregnancy can bolster these efforts.  The authors hope that these results will be used to advocate for EBF especially in China where the EBF rate is “still relatively low.”</p>
<p>The ways in which breastfeeding might help prevent asthma may be complex, but one possible mechanism is that breast milk could encourage the growth of “good bacteria” in the gut to promote immune development.  More research is needed to determine how the benefits provided by breast milk actually work.</p>

<p>Half of us have been unfaithful in our lifetime, and one in five people within their current relationship. As sexual infidelity is the primary cause of divorce and one of the hardest issues to address in couples therapy, identifying any useful defences could make a huge difference to people’s happiness. In a <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/pere.12235?campaign=woletoc">recent paper</a> in <i>Personal Relationships</i> Brenda Lee and Lucia O’Sullivan from the University of New Brunswick investigated what strategies people in relationships use to reduce the chances they will cheat – so-called “monogomy maintainance strategies” – and looked into whether or not they are actually effective.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><span id="more-34651"></span></p>
<p>The pair surveyed 362 heterosexual adults aged 19-63 online about how they’d tried to resist temptation when they had been in a relationship and had felt a strong attraction to someone else. Their answers suggested there are three main types of monogomy maintainance strategy: “relationship enhancement”, used by three-quarters of participants, included things like taking a partner out on a date, making an extra effort with their appearance around their partner, or engaging in sexual acts with them;<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“proactive avoidance” was similarly common, and involved maintaining distance from the temptation, both physically, and also in terms of avoiding getting close in conversation; and finally “derogation of the temptation”, which was slightly less frequent, and involved applying negativity towards the relationship threat, and guilt towards the self, in an attempt to pour cold water on the prospect.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Lee and O’Sullivan’s findings suggest these strategies are largely ineffective. Participants reported flirting less when they applied the final, negative kind of strategy. But none of the strategies had an effect on more consequential outcomes: romantic infidelity, sexual infidelity, and whether the current relationship survived. This pattern was borne out in a followup study with more participants that asked them how they were dealing with a threat to a current relationship. So as informative as this research is, it paints a gloomy picture: we may call upon these techniques, but they don’t appear to make much difference in staving off temptation.</p>
<p>Thankfully, there is some optimism to be found in <a href="http://psycnet.apa.org/record/2018-05467-001">another recent study</a> on the same topic, published in the <i>Journal of Personality and Social Psychology</i>. This paper zoomed in on moment-to-moment attentional responses, and these seemed genuinely predictive of success in avoiding infidelity.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Across two experiments, the researchers, led by James McNulty at Florida State University, asked members of 233 newly married couples whether they had ever engaged in infidelity in the relationship – 37 confessed.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>The same participants also completed a task where they had to disengage from images of attractive opposite-sex faces in order to respond quickly to stimuli flashed up elsewhere on a computer screen. McNulty and his team explain how this automatic disengagement from attractive prospects is plausibly an aid to monogamy maintenance, and the data bore this out: participants who were substantially better at disengaging from the alluring pictures were half as likely to have been unfaithful.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Another component of the experiment involved rating the physical attractiveness of the images involved in the task. All the participants considered the images as somewhat less attractive than did a separate group of single participants, reflecting a well-established tendency for people in relationships to devalue the attractiveness of others. McNulty’s team predicted that the married participants who engaged in more of this devaluing of temptation would be more likely to be faithful, and again the results confirmed this.</p>
<p>Why is it that these attentional processes were associated with lower infidelity, yet Lee and O’Sullivan’s monogamy maintaining strategies (including the similar-sounding derogating and downplaying of the relationship threat) were ineffective? Perhaps it has to do with the attentional process (McNulty’s team call them “psychological biases”) being automatic, while the monogamy maintaining strategies are more deliberate and perhaps, sometimes, too late. After all, if I meet someone captivating at a party, I might get home and decide to tell myself they aren’t so great (ticking the box for that strategy). But if I’m unpracticed, I may not persuade myself. In fact I may wrestle with myself and end up ruminating on that person all the more.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Building the automatic, habitual protective processes uncovered by McNulty’s team arguably takes practice. So if we want to maintain our relationships by staying monogamous, sacrifices are needed ahead of time. The well-trained mind can dial down the titillation of temptation to a background hum: it won’t get to enjoy the occasional harmless little interludes, but nor will it be carried away by the crescendo.</p>

Now, two new studies separately show that a very similar effect occurs in relation to touch (<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0010027718301227">inattentional numbness</a>) and to smell<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>(<a href="http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0956797618781325">inattentional anosmia</a>).<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><span id="more-34632"></span></p>
<p>Sandra Murphy and Polly Dalton (a co-author on the inattentional deafness paper) at Royal Holloway, University of London report in the journal <i>Cognition</i> on inattentional numbness. They wanted to go beyond the way we rapidly tune out ongoing tactile stimulation, like the sensation of our clothes, and explore what happens when we’re touched more than once out of the blue. (“If someone taps us on the shoulder, are we less likely to notice their other hand going into our pocket?” they write.)</p>
<p>To investigate, they recruited 37 women and 45 men aged 18-47. The participants sat with their hands in front of them, palms up. Bone-conduction hearing aids, which would deliver vibration stimulations, were taped to their palms, and a black cloth was placed over the top, so they couldn’t see any movement. The participants also listened to white noise, to mask any sounds.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>On each trial, the participants were instructed to count the number of vibrations presented to their hands (until the end of each block of trials, the sensations were always to just one of their hands – either the left, or right, counterbalanced across participants). Half the participants were given a relatively easy, low attentional-load version of this task: to count <i>all</i> the vibrations applied to their palms. The others had to keep separate counts of the number of constant vibrations and the number of pulsed vibrations – a task that placed a bigger demand on their attentional resources.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Each experimental block consisted of 16 trials. On the 16th, an unexpected extra stimulus was applied to the <i>other hand</i> at the same time as the target sequence on the usual hand. Ninety-two per cent of participants in the low-load condition noticed this extra stimulus, whereas 69 per cent of those in the high-load group completely missed it – suggesting they had experienced “inattentional numbness”.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>“The present study provides the first robust demonstration of inattentional numbness to a one-off tactile event that is completely unexpected and therefore genuinely unattended,” Murphy and Dalton write.</p>
<p>This study investigated touch awareness when the brain was already focusing on a touch task. But there’s evidence from earlier work that, for inattentional effects to occur, the two stimuli do not have to involve the same senses, and the new paper in <i>Psychological Science</i> on inattentional anosmia also finds this.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Sophie Forster, at the University of Sussex, and Charles Spence, head of the Crossmodal Research Laboratory at the University of Oxford, looked at the effects of performing a high vs. low attentional-load visual task on scent awareness.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Across a series of experiments, groups of participants had to repeatedly search for a target letter – X or N – arranged in a circle together with either five small letter “o”s (the easy, low attentional-load version of the task) or five similarly-sized angular non-target letters, such as W and Z<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>(the high-load version), while exposed to the background scent of coffee (open bags of coffee beans were concealed in the room).<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Forster and Spence found that those in the high-load groups were much less likely to afterwards report having detected that scent, suggesting that the attention they’d used up on the visual task had left them with a temporary lack of smell, or anosmia. (In two of the experiments, 42.5 per cent fewer participants in the high visual load condition, compared to the low-load condition, reported noticing the smell.)</p>
<p>“The results of the present study establish the phenomenon of inattentional anosmia for the first time,” Forster and Spence write. “In real-world terms, our study implies that people are significantly less likely to notice ambient smells in their surroundings when they are engaged in a visually-demanding task.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>One of the experiments revealed a further intriguing detail: participants could become habituated to the coffee scent even while their attention was absorbed elsewhere, suggesting that the scent had been processed at some level even though it had not reached conscious awareness. This habituation to the scent meant that even after the task was over, and they had plenty of attention to spare, they were less likely to detect the aroma.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>“The present study reveals that olfactory attention shares a key common characteristic with visual and auditory attention, in terms of the effect of perceptual capacity limits on <i>irrelevant processing</i>,” the researchers write (my italics).<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>It’s worth noting that in these new studies, neither the smell of coffee nor the gentle, brief secondary touch stimulus were in any way threatening. Not only were they irrelevant to the task at hand, they were also irrelevant to survival.</p>
<p>It remains to be confirmed whether inattentional effects on our multi-sensory awareness are the same for more important or threatening incoming stimuli. There’s reason to think they will be –<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>for instance, there’s evidence that pain perception is reduced when other activities or events are hogging our attention (when playing a VR game, for example). It would be interesting to see work exploring whether we can fail even to notice potentially dangerous smells – such as burning – and potentially damaging touch stimuli while we’re concentrating on something else.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

                <h4><a href="http://romainbrette.fr/better-than-the-grant-lottery/">Better than the grant lottery</a></h4>

<p>Funding rates for most research grant systems are currently very low, typically around 10%. This means that 90% of the time spent on writing and evaluating grant applications is wasted. It means that if each grant spans 5 years, then a PI has to write about 2 grants per year to be continuously funded; in practice, to reduce risk it should be more than 2 per year. It is an enormous waste, and in addition to that, it is accepted that below a certain funding rate, grant selection is essentially random (<a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/13323v1">Fang et al., 2016</a>). Such competition also introduces conservative biases (since only those applications that are consensual can make it to the top 10%), for example against interdisciplinary studies. Thus, low funding rates are a problem not only because of waste but also because they introduce distortions.</p>
<p>For these reasons, a number of scientists have proposed to introduce a lottery system (<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4959526/">Fang 2016</a>; see also Mark Humphries’ <a href="https://medium.com/the-spike/how-not-to-choose-which-science-is-worth-funding-c6b4605ce8f1">post</a>): after a first selection, of say, the top 20-30%, the winners are picked at random. This would reduce bias without impacting quality. Thus, it would certainly be a progress. However, it does not address the problem of waste. 90% of applications would still be written in vain.</p>
<p>First, there is a very elementary enhancement to be implemented: pick at random <em>before</em> you evaluate the grants, i.e., directly reject every other grant, then select the best 20%. This gives exactly the same result, except the cost of evaluation is divided by two.</p>
<p>Now I am sure it would feel quite frustrating for an applicant to write a full grant only to get immediately rejected by the flip of a coin. So there is again a very simple enhancement: decide who will get rejected <em>before</em> they write the application. Pick at random 50% of scientists and invite them to submit a grant. Again, the result is the same, but in addition you reduce the time spent on grant writing by two.</p>
<p>At this point we might wonder why do this initial selection at random? This introduces variance for no good reason. You never know in advance whether you will be allowed to get funding next year and this seems arbitrary. Thus, there is an obvious enhancement: replace lottery by rotation. Every PI is allowed to submit a grant only every two years. Again, this is equivalent on average to the initial lottery system, except there is less variance and less waste.</p>
<p>This reasoning leads me to a more general point. There is a simple way to increase the success rate of a grant system, which is to reduce the number of applications. The average funding rate of labs does not depend on the number of applications; it depends on the budget and only on the budget. If you bar 50% of scientists from applying, then you don’t divide by two the average budget of every lab. The average budget allocated to each lab is the same, but the success rate is doubled.</p>
<p>The counter-intuitive part is that individually, you increase your personal success rate if you apply to more calls. But collectively it is exactly the opposite: the global success rate decreases if there are more calls (for the same overall budget), since there are more applications. This is because the success rate is low because of other people submitting, not because you are submitting. This is a tragedy of commons phenomenon.</p>
<p>There is a simple way to solve it, which is to add constraints. There are different ways to do it: 1) reduce the frequency of calls, and merge redundant calls, 2) introduce a rotation (e.g. those born on even years submit on even years), 3) do not allow submission if you are already funded (or say, in the first years). Any of these constraints mechanically increases the success rate, thus reduces both waste and bias, with no impact on average funding. It is better than a lottery.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>p.s.: There is also an obvious and efficient way to reduce the problem, which is to increase base funding, so that scientists do not need grants in order to survive (see this and other ideas <a href="http://romainbrette.fr/a-few-ideas-to-improve-the-grant-system/">in a previous post</a>).</p>

I was keen to interview the only woman among Human Brain Project leaders, the scientific director Katrin Amunts. In November 2017, she agreed to do an interview by email. In March 2018, Amunts announced that "the manuscript already has a veritable size of several pages". She never contacted me since. This is therefore a non-interview.

<h4>We need to get past the essentialist mindset about coding</h4><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*FWTCVAbwOEaK3JPhhBW8JA.jpeg" />Like these plants, you too can grow on keyboards. (Photo: Ashley Juavinett)</figure><p>When our summer intern Daniel first joined the lab, he seemed terrified of MATLAB.</p><p>And I can’t blame him — encountering a programming language in the wild is intimidating, especially when you sign up for a summer research program and they ask you to declare upfront whether you’re “computational” or not. Daniel is categorically <em>not</em>.</p><p>Daniel signed up for a “biological” neuroscience lab, so he was surprised when he encountered code in almost every aspect our work. We use it to collect raw data, present stimuli, and analyze gigabytes of output. Collectively, our lab codes in many languages, and most of us are proficient in two or three. We’re not labeled as a computational lab, but each of us has had to learn how to code and employ math for one reason or another.</p><p>So, I encouraged him to give coding a shot. I borrowed a copy of <em>MATLAB for Neuroscientists</em>, gave him a fairly straightforward task to code, and let him loose. I wasn’t really sure how to train him, but I knew one thing for sure: he could learn how to code if he wanted to.</p><h4>Coding on the fly</h4><p>Like many neuroscientists, I never had a formal coding education. I didn’t take any computer science courses — they were encouraged but not necessary (and even now, <a href="https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/blog/2016/01/30/computer-science-all">only a quarter of K-12 schools offer coding classes</a>). I’ve never had to teach anybody how to code, and have only recently begun to consider myself a person who is proficient at coding.</p><p>“How did you learn how to code?” Daniel asks me.</p><p>“Truthfully, through trial and error. And a lot of Google searches.” Oh, and I probably bugged my gracious labmates quite a bit.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/563/1*vMCCmCdRBsKzMpAOqDRq1Q.png" /></figure><p>I’ve long thought of myself as a Math &amp; Science Person, so I was open to the idea that I could also be a Coding &amp; Computation Person. We tend to lump all of these skillsets into one larger (STEM) identity: the person who flies through rows of multiplication problems in grade school, excels on quantitative sections of standardized tests, and eventually becomes a coder.</p><p>However, not everyone in neuroscience research identifies as math-y. In fact, many have internalized the idea that they’re “not a math person,” a phrase that is loaded with deep-seated beliefs about how intellectual ability works. More complex computational approaches certainly benefit from advanced mathematics backgrounds, but math experience doesn’t mean you automatically know how to code. Still, because we so strongly associate math, coding, and computation, many folks assume that coding is not for them.</p><h4>Mindsets and labels change how we learn</h4><p>For the past two decades, <a href="https://www.ted.com/talks/carol_dweck_the_power_of_believing_that_you_can_improve">Carol Dweck</a> and colleagues have been developing a body of research that encourages educators and parents to reconsider the way that we teach children, especially in mathematics. If you ask students and educators to reflect on what makes people good at math, you’ll find that some believe more strongly in fixed or innate abilities, whereas others believe that intellectual abilities are malleable and can be learned. Dweck coined the terms “fixed” and “growth” mindsets to describe our implicit beliefs about intellectual ability. The punchline for math and science education is startling: students with growth mindsets <a href="https://www.mtoliveboe.org/cmsAdmin/uploads/blackwell-theories-of-intelligence-child-dev-2007.pdf">perform better over time</a> (even in <a href="http://psycnet.apa.org/record/2003-07329-012">organic chemistry</a>).</p><p>The story for computer science is similar. Our beliefs about whether computational abilities are fixed or malleable impact our <a href="https://tll.mit.edu/sites/default/files/library/Cheryan_2009.pdf">sense of belonging</a>, <a href="https://computinged.wordpress.com/2012/05/10/learning-is-about-the-failure-and-struggle-not-the-success/">how we respond to difficulties</a>, and ultimately, our <a href="https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?doid=1734263.1734409">achievement</a>.</p><p>In the U.S., we have <a href="https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2960332">strong cultural ideas</a> about what it means to be <a href="http://www.pixel42.com/cv/publications/Charters2014_GidgetStereotypes.pdf">a person who can code</a>. Fresh summer interns are picking up on more than just experimental skills — they’re also learning our cultural norms. When we ask students to declare themselves as computational or not, the underlying message is that these skillsets are innate, and only <em>some</em> students are computational.</p><p>Implicit beliefs about computational abilities also intersect with biases about race and gender. Well-meaning people still have implicit biases about gender, race, and math — I’ll be the first to admit that I too am not completely rid of these implicit beliefs, but I’m actively working against them. Worse than unintentionally weighty survey questions or lab descriptors are the more explicit beliefs that some people are mathematically-inclined, and others aren’t. Even if the predominant and politically correct message is that men and women are equal, there are still outspoken sexist <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/08/07/business/google-women-engineer-fired-memo.html">Google employees</a> and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/dec/01/dna-james-watson-scientist-selling-nobel-prize-medal">racist Nobel Prize winners</a>. <a href="http://psycnet.apa.org/record/2012-02597-001">Women</a> and <a href="https://stemeducationjournal.springeropen.com/articles/10.1186/s40594-018-0115-6">minorities</a> especially take these messages to heart, and it can be incredibly damaging.</p><p>Early lab experiences are critical windows for young scientists to gain insight about our field and envision their place in it. During this period especially, we should be spreading the notion that <em>everyone </em>can develop coding and computational skillsets (or any other skills, for that matter). These types of positive, growth-oriented messages are impactful, <a href="https://ed.stanford.edu/news/new-research-demonstrate-how-specific-interventions-can-boost-success-first-generation-and">especially for first-generation and minority students</a>.</p><h4>Subfield names can be misleading</h4><p>I’m certainly not trying to wash over the interesting subfields of neuroscience. “Computational” can be a meaningful descriptor for labs that <em>do not</em> conduct experimental work. But it doesn’t necessarily work the other way — many molecular biology labs are turning to larger scale analyses across proteomes or genomes, and cognitive neuroscience labs have been well-situated in computational approaches for a long while. And systems neuroscience is increasingly moving into the world of big data as we obtain data from more and more neurons and brain regions.</p><p>Perhaps “theoretical” neuroscience is a better term for some labs, and less loaded with preconceived notions about who is mathematical, and who isn’t. Still, I understand that “computational” has become a primary way to describe research that involves modeling and more complex data analyses, so it may be too late to redefine an entire field. We should at least be cautious when we label labs as computational or not when we’re inviting students in — sometimes it’s just plain misleading.</p><p>Regardless, if you’re new to neuroscience research, know this: <strong>you can be </strong>(and may need to be) a neuroscientist who uses code, math, and statistics to study the brain. Coding is a skill, just like learning how to play a sport or an instrument. You might feel like you’re making more mistakes than other people — you’re not. When I first encountered a coding challenge in graduate school, I was greeted with rows and rows of blaring red error messages. Years later, I still get errors, but I furrow my brow much, much less.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/392/1*-AOcQcA2EaOUWtQMvpu_NA.png" /></figure><p>In thinking about this article, I sat down with a few of the summer interns to chat about academia and ask them their thoughts about the supposed divide between computation and biology. A few had crossed over in their summer internship, either expectedly or unexpectedly. When we discussed Daniel’s experience of encountering lines and lines of code in a “biology” lab, they all nodded in agreement — they didn’t see a firm divide between biological and computational labs. And they’re right, there isn’t. When we focus on the research itself, the boundary crumbles.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*FLf47m1aH5fOwnZTGEZEHg.jpeg" />Daniel’s final presentation for the CSHL Undergraduate Research Program (Photo credit: Anne Urai)</figure><p>Daniel is a first-generation college student from Colombia. He’s overcome many obstacles to be here, and has made amazing strides this summer in MATLAB. During his final presentation, he discussed his analysis of gigabytes of behavioral and electrophysiology data, which he performed using his own code. He’s not a computational summer intern, but he sure looks like one.</p><h4>This post is the beginning of a conversation</h4><p>This piece is part of a series that will eventually morph into a book, tentatively titled “<em>So you want to be a neuroscientist?

                <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/~r/plos/Blog/~3/Kp5izAwZz9E/">Transparency, credit, and peer review</a></h4>

<div class="wp_orcid_field"><a href="http://orcid.org/orcid.org/0000-0001-8771-7239" rel="author" target="_blank">orcid.org/0000-0001-8771-7239</a></div><p> </p>
<p>Yesterday I signed an <a href="http://asapbio.org/letter">open letter</a> on behalf of all PLOS journals, alongside 20 other editors representing over 100 publications, to commit to offering transparent peer review options.</p>
<p>Support for publication of reviewer reports has been mounting as part of a greater effort to inform the discussion on peer review practice. Our joint commitment to transparent peer review comes on the heels of a <a href="http://asapbio.org/peer-review/summary">meeting</a> we attended earlier this year organized by HHMI, The Wellcome Trust and ASAPbio. Funders, editors, and publishers came together and agreed that elevating the visibility of peer review is paramount for informed scholarly discussion and early career development. Context for the initiatives is provided today in a <em><a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-06032-w">Nature commentary</a></em>.</p>
<p>We are excited to be working alongside so many other journals eager to bring posted reviews to our communities and to help change the way in which we talk about and understand peer review.</p>
<p><strong>How it works</strong></p>
<p>Our approach is to let authors and reviewers decide what level of transparency is right for them on a case by case basis. Authors will choose whether to make the peer review history public at the end of the assessment process for their manuscript. Reviewers will decide whether to reveal their identities or remain anonymous. We encourage authors and reviewers to experiment with the new options.</p>
<p><strong>What’s in it for researchers?</strong></p>
<p>Transparent peer review is a critical first step towards elevating peer review reports as recognized scholarly outputs.</p>
<p>We plan to post peer reviews with a DOI so that it can be cited in the contributor’s CV or referenced as the foundation for further discussion of the work. This is especially critical for early career researchers to be able to demonstrate their varied contributions to their field.</p>
<p>We hope that deeper insight into peer review will strengthen understanding of the scientific record and help future generations of researchers learn about the assessment process.</p>
<p><strong>Ready for change</strong></p>
<p>Before making our decision, we asked our communities what they thought of transparent peer review and surveyed the feedback from other journals that have already implemented or experimented with different forms of transparent review.</p>
<p>In a 2017 survey of our reviewers, 87% of participants said they would be fine with posted reviews. Of the remaining 13%, many indicated that they felt this decision should be left up to the authors, a concern that we’ve taken into account by allowing authors to decide whether they want to publish their peer reviews or not (according to another survey, 45% of them do).</p>
<p>Other journals who offer to post anonymous reviews, including <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/ncomms13626"><em>Nature Communications</em></a>, <em>eLife</em>, and <a href="http://emboj.embopress.org/content/29/23/3891"><em>The EMBO Journal</em></a>, saw little to no difference in reviewer participation rates after implementing similar policies.</p>
<p><strong>We’ll share what we learn</strong></p>
<p>While transparent peer review isn’t a new concept, it hasn’t yet been widely adopted. With over 23,000 research articles published each year in the PLOS family of journals, there is an opportunity for us to affect meaningful change in the way scholarly communities in all disciplines learn about and understand peer review.</p>
<p>We are excited to offer transparent peer review to our contributors. As we move forward, we’ll be analyzing our processes, gathering data, and listening to feedback from our contributors in order to report back to the community.</p>

Less than two weeks ago, PLOS ONE published a paper about the parents of teenagers who appeared to immediately start questioning their gender identity around the time of puberty. Then the critiques flooded in. The paper — about a highly contentious issue — surveyed parents who felt that their children had suddenly started to question … <a class="more-link" href="https://retractionwatch.com/2018/08/29/reader-outcry-prompts-brown-to-retract-press-release-on-trans-teens/">Continue reading <span class="screen-reader-text">Reader outcry prompts Brown to retract press release on trans teens</span></a>

<strong>Can psychology help us to learn better?</strong> Our presenter <a href="http://www.christianjarrett.com">Christian Jarrett</a> discovers the best evidence-backed strategies for learning, including the principle of spacing, the benefits of testing yourself and teaching others. He also hears about the perils of overconfidence and the lack of evidence for popular educational ideas like “learning styles” and “brain gym”.</p>

                <h4><a href="http://brainblogger.com/2018/08/27/whats-personality-got-to-do-with-us-a-lot/">What’s Personality Got To Do With Us? A Lot</a></h4>

<p>Personality is understood as the consistent features we display in regards to our thinking, feeling, and behavior. It begins to emerge around the age of 3. Prior to that, we refer to the genetically primed aspects of who we are as temperament.</p>
<p>Personality is dynamically formed via multiple inputs from many others. It becomes consolidated in our late teens to early 20’s. Around age 30 or so it becomes relatively fixed.</p>
<p>According to Daniel Siegel personality is deeply rooted in the human mind by the flow of information in the brain and between brains, is created via neural/mental representations during this flow, and interpersonal exchanges shape its formation and maturation (1999).</p>
<p>Siegel further adds that these interpersonal interactions construct our personal interpretations of reality. And according to Siegel, maternal and paternal attachments are fundamental in creating the necessary foundation of intrapersonal and interpersonal development. And he indicates emotions are the primary linkage between our intrapersonal and interpersonal worlds. And I believe this early foundation sets for us a lifelong paradigm.</p>
<p>Our life trajectory involves a series of developmental opportunities to build a healthy sense of self and others. This constructs our self-concept in regards to how others see us and feel towards us. It impacts our sense of self-efficacy, confidence and competence, and how others perceive us as being prosocial, asocial, or antisocial; which I refer to as global personality orientation.</p>
<p>For example, Erik Erickson proposes a series of lifelong psychosocial stages. They consist of the following: Trust or Mistrust; Autonomy or Shame and Doubt; Initiative or Guilt; Industry or Inferiority; Identity or Role Confusion or based on my own clinical observations, Role Diffusion; Intimacy or Isolation; Generativity or Stagnation; Integrity or Despair (Plotnik, 2014). And I dare add an additional stage based on my clinical observations, Transcendence and Relief or Dread and Decay.</p>
<p>From the field of Sociology, I borrow the concept of <em>Perceived Social Value</em> (PSV). This applies to the various roles that all of us enact and the concepts of “front-stage and back-stage personas”. Some refer to this as our private and public selves. As a clinician, I am very interested in the extent of the concordance or disagreement between these selves. Those with disordered personalities tend to show a decided disconnect between the two!</p>
<p>Referring back to the notion of roles, over time, we enact multiple roles, sometimes simultaneously. For instance, I was a child, an adolescent, a male, a college student, an Air Force medic during the Vietnam Conflict. Now I am retired. I’m also a father, grandfather, brother, a former university faculty member and the like. Our personality shapes how well we do or do not in these various roles. Those with disordered personalities exhibit rigidity and dysfunction across the various roles.</p>
<p>So as you can readily see, personality has a heck of a lot to do with who we are, and how we interact with the many others we come in contact with!</p>

                <h4><a href="http://brainblogger.com/2018/08/27/the-dark-beast-behind-combat-trauma-a-clinicians-view/">The “Dark Beast” Behind Combat Trauma—a Clinician’s View</a></h4>

<p>This particular article is inspired by my perusal of Lt. Col. Dave Grossman’s “On Killing: The Psychological Cost of Learning to Kill in War and Society” and “Shooting Ghosts” by Thomas J. Brennan and Finbarr O’Reilly. I am a retired clinical psychologist and psychology professor. I also served as an Air Force medic during the Vietnam Conflict. I did not serve “in country”. I served as a medic at Andrews AFB in the emergency room of Malcolm Grow Medical Center. There I witnessed considerable physical trauma. I witnessed death on a number of occasions, some violent, some peaceful. I remember the violent ones.</p>
<p>I also served temporary duty (TDY) at Lackland AFB working with airman stationed in Vietnam, presenting with PTSD and substance abuse disorder (SUD).  As a clinician in Behavioral Health Care, I dealt with folks presenting with multiple psychosocial trauma, including combat Vets from Vietnam.</p>
<p>I’ve not witnessed directly the ghosts of combat. Those who have repeatedly are haunted by those of comrades killed (KIA) and by those who they killed, especially those who are civilians. Thus, they experience what I refer to as “compacted grief”. During war, there is little room and energy to grieve.</p>
<p>I completely agree with Lt. Col. Grossman that most of us possess a natural inclination to not kill other humans. No amount of combat training can prepare soldiers for the realities of war and combat. I see war as an extreme expression of insanity, even when war is deemed by some to be necessary and the participants are “voluntary”. War and combat sear us at the limbic level, a necessary encounter which I refer to as “Dark Beast”. The Vets I have treated and my many clients in BHC have taught me so much about this Beast. The following account here centers on my running commentary as I read “Shooting Ghosts”, using my observing clinical ego.</p>
<p>When I embarked on reading their candid descriptions of encountering repeated episodes of violent death, At times I felt guilty for not having served in Vietnam. I joined the Air Force after my college deferment lapsed once I graduated. I did not really support our endeavor there. I never felt this Conflict to be an urgent and immediate threat to our nation’s integrity. I became a medic so that I would not have to kill anyone, nor would anyone would be killing me. I did therapy with some of the field medics who were confronted with killing. Killing is counterintuitive to our ethical oath to: <em>above all else, do no harm</em>.</p>
<p><u>From Chapter One</u>, I disagree that “Misfits Go to War”. We join the military for a number of reasons. For the most part, the Armed Forces want servicemen with integrity who join for a higher purpose like serving our country and protecting others. The bonds forged with comrades begin during advanced training and intensifies early in deployment. Individual survival is directly associated within this group that we refer to as our squad. It is this commitment that soldiers go into battle and come back as a group which I refer to as “affiliative aggression”. Soldiers are protecting one another!</p>
<p>The second disagreement is that war and journalism do mix in order to inform the rest of us about the horrors and terrors of war, and the tremendous cost borne by those who directly experience it. And none of us are “fearless and invincible”. In fact, my professional experiences assure me that life is quite precious and tenuous at the same time; so we dearly need to hold onto it! And guns and cameras are valuable tools of the respective trades.</p>
<p><u>Chapter Three: Ambushed</u></p>
<p>Now it is kill or be killed by the enemy. Affiliative and defensive aggression is rising. They sustain some injuries and every squad member returns to their outpost. No time for “mental casualties”; the BB is really present for the first time! An RPG creates a concussion suffered by the squad leader.  Back at the outpost “Air Force medics” come to the rescue. Everyone is alive, but are they really? Concussions are quite serious. Each skirmish does not change the outcome of the war; yet indeed changes those who participate!</p>
<p><u>Chapter Four: Walking Wounded</u></p>
<p>The human brain consists of about One Trillion nerve cells, and about ½ of our genome is dedicated to the form and function of this organ. Sounds like a lot and many that can be spared. Indeed, the brain is well known for its neuroplasticity! I’m uncertain as well if God has or has not allowed us to contemplate going to war let alone engage in it. Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI) also occurred in Vietnam, not just in our more recent conflicts. Perhaps it is garnering more clinical attention? We know that it is also intimately related to Clinical Depression and PTSD. I agree that repeated combat encounters result in a “kinship and loyalty” that many of us will never know!</p>
<p><u>Chapter Five: The in-between</u></p>
<p>The brain and all of our human senses process all of our internal and external experiences. I refer to the brain as a “master accountant”. Much of what we process occurs beneath our conscious awareness. </p>
<p>In fact, there are at least seven streams of awareness. Some are deeply embedded suggesting that we better remember certain experiences more than others to ensure our survival.</p>
<p>Those in combat continue to experience the traumas once confronted repeatedly by the DB! Being back “home” and away from the front lines does not matter. We are genetically primed by our “threat alarm” in responding to perceived and/or real threats by fighting, fleeing, or freezing. Our primary cognitive processes regarding threats pertain to harm, loss, and challenge. We must not ignore them!</p>
<p>Even photographers and journalists are not immune to being harmed or killed! Immunity from stress and trauma is indeed an “illusion”. During adolescence, males exhibit an increase of invincibility (probably due to the significant infusion of testosterone). And there is no “magical cure” for real trauma. And life <strong><em>is </em></strong>more important than what each of us do for a living.</p>
<p><u> </u></p>
<p><u>Chapter Six: Human Triggers</u></p>
<p>Another death of a platoon member, who is very experienced in combat; and he is survived by a wife and children, gets a lot of attention. His loss impacts more than this soldiers. And indeed death is all around as the “Dark Beast” possesses an insatiable appetite for “kills and body counts”.</p>
<p>The effects of TBI on the squad leader are apparent. And there is no room for complacency and lapses of concentration! They are becoming human targets and increasingly aware of this reality. The sights, smells, and sounds of violent death are deeply etched in the collective minds of these soldiers. Home for them seems a long way off! The platoon leader earns a Purple Heart. And he feels he doesn’t deserve it. So far, he and his men are alive.</p>
<p><u>Chapter Seven: Lost Limbs and Skull Tattoos</u></p>
<p>Another photographer is severely injured having stepped on an IED. It is natural to “dread” the “damaged cargo” carried by the MEDEVAC choppers. Some photojournalists become resigned to this possible occupational fate. There is a growing sense that these soldiers may not ever win the “hearts and minds” of the Afghan civilians despite their best efforts to do so.</p>
<p>Some of the violence and deaths of comrades that these soldiers experience are etched on the largest sense organ—the skin. No time to deal with any of this in a combat zone, no time to grieve! Suppression of trauma from previous combat excursions does not work either! And the photojournalist embedded with this squad begins to question his witness position and “feels predatory, repulsive, and a betrayal of human decency”.</p>
<p><u>Chapter Fourteen: Coming Undone</u></p>
<p>The home front is becoming undone. Interpersonal relationships are becoming frazzled. The natural regression after repeated exposure to the “Dark Beast” is taking its toll. All the prescribed psychotropics (chemical cocktails) in the world won’t make that much difference. BTW suicide among combat vets is rising despite priority efforts to prevent them.</p>
<p><u>Chapter Sixteen: Echoes of Iraq</u></p>
<p>The Boston Marathon bombing reawakens images of the “DB” on US soil for the second time since the attack on 9-11. Surely there is no safety and security now! Understandably, cemeteries and headstones serve as triggers. For soldiers converting back to civilian life, there exists a natural disconnect between military culture and the civilian role; clinicians refer to this as cognitive dissonance, and it penetrates much deeper than just our thinking!</p>
<p>Advanced combat training does not really train soldiers to kill the designated enemy, only the illusion of them. And the military certainly does not prepare them to kill civilians such as children, women, and the aged. Yet, this happens in actual combat. For example, during the Vietnam Conflict, it is estimated that more civilians were killed than enemy combatants on both sides. This distinction gets lost in the insanity of combat. Yet the civilian-soldier has to come to terms with this reality; and based on having conducted psychotherapy with Vietnam combat Vets, the grief and regret become almost unbearable! I refer to this state as psychosocial death. Sociologist, Erving Goffman, refers to this as “mortification”. Killing the innocent does not reflect affiliative or defensive aggression. To me, it is an adverse consequence of encounters with the “Dark Beast”.</p>
<p><u>Final Thoughts and Observations</u></p>
<p>First of all, I express my sincere gratitude to all those who have, do now, and will serve in the Armed Forces; and my gratitude to all the loved ones who endure this journey with them. I want you all to know, that in my clinical view, soldiers do what they do out of affiliative and defensive aggression; they are not predators!</p>
<p>Those who send humans to war need to examine much more closely the human damage done to the participants and family members for whatever gains are earned in doing so.</p>
<p>And it is my clinical observation that group counseling/therapy could be more efficacious in treating those who are haunted by the ghosts of combat. Group therapy can recapitulate the crucial military unit- the squad. This offers a better opportunity for some healing from the repeated exposure to the “Dark Beast”.</p>

Some of that found its way (without proper conflict of interest declaration) into Ignarro's peer reviewed papers.

A preprint recently posted on bioRxiv has garnered a lot of attention - mainly because of its title. The article, from Jan Willem Koten Jr et al., is called Occurrence of non-western magic in the European brain, an intriguing although not very informative title for a scientific paper.

The intrigue deepens once we read the paper and find references to the famous 'voodoo correlations' and also a new species of neuro-monster: 'zombie oscillations', which the authors claim to have discovered and

The sun spits out more and weirder gamma rays than anyone expected, which could give a new view of the sun’s magnetic fields.

                <h4><a href="http://brainblogger.com/2018/08/24/the-brain-of-an-introvert/">The Brain of an Introvert</a></h4>

<p>In the age of social media, networking and global never-ending communication, introverts are often viewed as rather inefficient. They are considered as people who would not happily express their opinion during the staff meetings or actively participate in brainstorming sessions. They are often considered to not be good at multitasking or be particularly charismatic. They are rarely at the center of attention at a party, and they often ignore their smartphones for hours in a row. These days, when we believe that big tasks require the active participation of large groups of people working together, being an introvert could come as a disadvantage.</p>
<p>But don’t discard introverts altogether: some of the most successful people in the world are introverts. Albert Einstein, Bill Gates, and even social media inventor Mark Zuckerberg are all self-confessed introverts. So how do these people who apparently lack some of the basic skills needed for a successful career manage to achieve so much? What makes the brain of an introvert so different and so special?</p>
<h2><font size="6">Being a loner has its upsides and downsides when it comes to health and success</font></h2><font size="6">
</font><p><font size="6"></font></p>
<p>It is well known that personality traits are not just the result of social conditioning – they have more to do with the genetics and brain structure. People are born or inherit specific personality traits quite like they inherit any particular physical parameters and characteristics. These personality traits bring their advantages and disadvantages. Studies have also demonstrated the anatomical difference between the introvert and extrovert brain. Imaging studies have shown the differences in both the grey matter and the white matter volumes in the various parts of the brain, thus confirming that personality traits are hard-wired into the brain.</p>
<p>Introverts do not like prolonged social interactions, and they feel uncomfortable in large social gatherings. Introverts don’t mind remaining isolated for extended periods. They love to think and dream. However, this self-imposed social isolation comes at a price. Lower social interaction increases the risk of certain disorders; it may negatively affect cognitive functioning, increase the risk of metabolic disorders, and negatively impact the immune system.</p>
<p>Extreme social isolation and its negative consequences are well studied. People living in orphanages or imprisoned for prolonged periods may go through periods of mental instability, and some may even experience hallucinations. However, being introverts is different, and self-imposed social isolation may not necessarily indicate idle brain or lack of resilience towards these health issues. The latest research studies show that these periods of being alone may have positive impacts on emotional and work life.</p>
<h2><font size="6">Focus on creativity</font></h2><font size="6">
</font><p><font size="6"></font></p>
<p>One of the benefits of being more focused on own thoughts is the improved creativity. Introverts are more open to different ideas; they may have a higher level of confidence and independence. Introverts are less concerned about what others may think. Studies have shown that prominent feature of both scientists and artists is the dislike for too much of social interaction: avoiding it leaves them with more time to focus on their ideas.</p>
<p>Introverts have more time to perfect their crafts than those who spend most of the time socializing. They have time to make sense of their thoughts and experiences. All this means that they have higher chances of achieving a eureka moment.</p>
<p>However, it should be understood that not every kind of social withdrawal is the same. Some type of non-socializing is an indicator of psychological and physical health issues. Social withdrawal may be due to shyness and anxiety, or it may be due to a dislike of socializing. Both may have a negative impact on health and would not necessarily better the creativity. On the other hand, those who socialize less just by choice (rather than due to anxiety or dislike) are more probable to be healthy and creative.</p>
<p>These findings are important, as earlier it was believed that unsociability can be harmful. Now the researchers demonstrated that unsociability might be even beneficial. Healthy introverts prefer to spend more time alone, but this does not mean a complete social withdrawal. They would usually have just enough of social interaction. Creative people prefer being alone, and at the same time, they spend enough time in the company of others.</p>
<p>The researchers also noticed that cultural differences may play an important role too. For instance, unsociable children in China had more academic problems in comparison to their Western counterparts. However, this difference is becoming less visible due to globalization.</p>
<p>There is a general belief that specific profession demand more sociable personality and extroverts are better in the leadership roles. However, this is not always accurate, and research shows that a lot depends on the collective nature of the employees. Introvert bosses are more successful if the employees are more sociable. On the other hand, extrovert bosses are better in a leadership role if the employees are less proactive.</p>
<h2><font size="6">Meditation, hermits, and health</font></h2><font size="6">
</font><p><font size="6"></font></p>
<p>If we look back into the human history, we understand that self-imposed isolation was commonly practiced by individual members of society. Hermits would practice solitude to achieve nirvana. Daydreaming in the absence of social interactions activates the so-called default mode of the brain. Thus, isolation helps in consolidating the memories and emotions, at least to a certain extent. Isolation helps a person in re-organizing thoughts. Interestingly, when people come out of self-imposed isolation, they are likely to socialize better and more effectively.</p>
<p>Researchers also warn that the boundary between the dangerous isolation and useful solitude is quite blurry. Extreme loneliness could be somewhat harmful or indicative of poor health. Practicing solitude to stay productive and creative does not mean being completely unsocial. On the other hand, there is a real danger for the physical and mental health of those who are never alone. Furthermore, research indicates that introverts have fewer but stronger bonds with others that lead to better satisfaction in life and greater happiness.</p>
<p>If a person does not like to socialize too much, there is nothing wrong with him or her. It is important that the solitude is a person’s choice and not forced upon him/her: even the classical introverts need few good friends.</p>
