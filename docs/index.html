              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/hiawatha-crater-greenland-age-younger-dryas">The mysterious Hiawatha crater in Greenland is 58 million years old</a></h4>

              
                <p>The powerful impact that created a mysterious crater at the northwestern edge of Greenland’s ice sheet happened <a href="http://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.abm2434">about 58 million years ago</a>, researchers report March 9 in <em>Science Advances</em>.</p>



<p>That timing, confirmed by two separate dating methods, means that the asteroid or comet or meteorite that carved the depression struck long before the Younger Dryas cold snap about 13,000 years ago. Some researchers have suggested the cold spell was caused by such an impact.</p>





<p>Scientists spotted the crater in 2015 during a scan by NASA’s Operation IceBridge, which used airborne radar to measure the ice sheet’s thickness. Those and other data revealed that the crater, dubbed Hiawatha, is <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/impact-crater-greenland-asteroid-younger-dryas">a round depression that spans 31 kilometers</a> and is buried beneath a kilometer of ice (<em>SN: 11/14/18</em>).</p>





<p>The next step was to determine how old the Hiawatha crater might be. Though the depression itself is unreachable, meltwater at the ice’s base had ported out pebbles and other sediments bearing telltale signs of alteration by an impact, including sand from partially melted rocks and pebbles containing intensely deformed, or “shocked,” zircon crystals.</p>

<p>Geochemist Gavin Kenny of the Swedish Museum of Natural History in Stockholm and colleagues dated these alterations using two methods based on the radioactive decay of isotopes, or different forms of elements. For the zircons, the team measured the decay of uranium to lead, and in the sand, the researchers compared the abundances of radioactive argon isotopes with stable ones. Both methods suggest that the impact occurred about 57.99 million years ago.</p>



<p>That makes the crater far too old to be the smoking gun long sought by proponents of the controversial <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/younger-dryas-comet-impact-cold-snap">Younger Dryas impact hypothesis</a> (<em>SN: 6/26/18</em>). The timing also isn’t quite right to link it to a warm period called the <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/glass-bits-charcoal-hint-56-million-year-old-space-rock-impact">Paleocene-Eocene Thermal Maximum</a>, which began around 56 million years ago (<em>SN: 9/28/16</em>). For now, the researchers say, what impact this space punch may have had on Earth&#8217;s global climate remains a mystery.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/genetically-modified-mosquito-test-california-epa-oxitec">Genetically modified mosquitoes could be tested in California soon</a></h4>

              
                <p>Genetically modified mosquitoes might soon be whining on both U.S. coasts. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has <a href="https://www.regulations.gov/document/EPA-HQ-OPP-2019-0274-0470">approved two more years</a> of testing Oxitec’s genetically modified mosquitoes as living pest controls, continuing a pilot program started in 2021 in the Florida Keys and expanding it to up to four counties in California. &nbsp;</p>



<p>Now the Florida and California state governments will consider whether to grant permission.</p>



<p>The male mosquitoes, OX5034 <em>Aedes aegypti</em> engineered by the biotech company Oxitec, carry daughter-killing genes that get passed generation to generation. When these males mate with local females outside a lab, only the sons should survive. Those inheriting the sabotage gene will grow up to mate with normal females, dooming their daughters too.</p>





<p>The wild <em>A. aegypti</em> species, an invader in North America, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/mosquitoes-florida-now-spreading-zika-virus-health-officials-warn">can spread dengue, Zika, yellow fever and other diseases</a> (<em>SN: 7/29/16</em>). California first reported the invader in 2013, and by February 2022 had found it in 22 counties. The EPA permission, issued March 7, will now allow testing of the GM mosquitoes, if desired, in Stanislaus, Fresno, Tulare and San Bernadino counties.</p>



<p>In Florida, the permit covers just one county, Monroe, which stretches down the Keys. The <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/mosquito-genetically-modified-us-florida-keys-pest-control-zika-dengue">2021 mosquito releases</a> there came after more than a decade of heated debate (<em>SN: 5/14/21</em>). Despite approval of the previous tests, the Florida Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services needs to vote again on the new plans. The last time, the group voted at its next board meeting after EPA announced its decision, but “we are not sure that will happen this time around,” says Chad Huff of the Florida Keys Mosquito Control District.</p>



<p>If approved and fulfilled to the EPA-set limits in both locations, nearly 2.5 billion of these GM mosquitoes could be released before permission expires April 30, 2024. Fortunately, male mosquitoes, GM or otherwise, don’t bite.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/crispr-de-extinct-christmas-rat-species-gene-editing">An extinct rat shows CRISPR’s limits for resurrecting species</a></h4>

              
                <p>Before the early 1900s, if it walked like a Christmas Island rat and talked like a Christmas Island rat, it probably was a Christmas Island rat. But if one of these now-extinct rats ever walks the Earth again, it will actually be a genetically modified Norway brown rat. And the rodent won’t be as similar to the Christmas Island rat as some would hope, a new study finds.</p>



<p>With the advent of <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/nobel-prize-chemistry-gene-editing-tool-crispr-wins" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">gene-editing technology such as CRISPR</a>, scientists have shifted from cloning to genetic engineering as the most promising method for “de-extinction,” or the resurrection of species that have died out (<em>SN: 10/7/20</em>). But unlike cloning, genetic engineering wouldn’t create an exact replica of an extinct species. Instead, the technique would edit an existing animal’s genome so that it resembles that of the desired extinct animal. The challenge is making that proxy as similar to the extinct species as possible.</p>



<p>To explore the limits of this method, researchers attempted to recover the genome of the Christmas Island rat. By comparing fragments of the extinct rat’s genetic instruction book with the genome of a living relative, the Norway brown rat, the team was able to recover about 95 percent of the extinct genome. That sounds like a lot, but it means that <a href="https://www.cell.com/current-biology/fulltext/S0960-9822(22)00249-4">5 percent of the genes were still missing</a>, including some important to smell and the immune system, scientists report in the April 11 <em>Current Biology</em>.</p>





<p>“You can only bring back what you can find. And our point is we can’t find everything,” says Tom Gilbert, an evolutionary biologist at the University of Copenhagen.</p>



<p>To get the extinct rat’s genome, Gilbert and his colleagues took ancient DNA from two preserved skin samples of the Christmas Island rat. <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/reviving-extinct-dna">Ancient DNA</a>, extracted from specimens that died anywhere from a few decades to thousands of years ago, is far from perfect (<em>SN: 5/19/08</em>). Gilbert describes an extinct species’ genome as a book that has been shredded. One way to reconstruct this shredded book is to scan the fragments and compare them with a reference.</p>



<p>With an intact copy of the original book, someone could theoretically reconstruct the book perfectly. When identifying a reference genome, researchers look for a species that diverged evolutionarily from the extinct species fairly recently —&nbsp;in other words, a very similar book. The genomes will match closely, but not perfectly.</p>



<p>For that reason, the Christmas Island rat (<em>Rattus macleari</em>) was an obvious choice for analysis for the scientists. It diverged from its closest relative, the Norway brown rat (<em>Rattus norvegicus</em>), only around 2.6 million years ago.</p>



<p>The team found that the Christmas Island rat genome mapped to about 95 percent of the Norway brown rat genome. Further analyses showed that the roughly 5 percent that was missing could not be explained solely by a flaw in the technique or an inadequate reference genome. Rather, because of evolutionary divergence between the two species, most of that genetic information was simply lost.</p>



<p>What’s more, the missing genes weren’t random. They tended to fall within two main regions that controlled the rat’s immune responses and sense of smell. So, if a Norway brown rat’s genome was edited to resemble the Christmas Island rat, the new critter would smell in a different way than its prototype did. This could hinder a proxy Christmas Island rat’s chance at survival if it were released into its former habitat.</p>

<p>Gilbert doesn’t think it’s likely that anyone will try to de-extinct a rat. But he says that what the team has demonstrated could prove useful for people working on even more ambitious projects, like bringing back the woolly mammoth. The divergence between the Norway brown rat and the extinct Christmas Island rat, for example, is similar to that between the Asian elephant and woolly mammoth.</p>



<p>“By doing these kinds of analyses, which is not hard to do, you can at least come up with the what will you get, what will you not get, and you can use that to decide is it worth doing,” Gilbert says.</p>



<p>Despite the hurdles, using the technology to bring back species is still worth doing, says Ben Novak, lead scientist at Revive &amp; Restore, a nonprofit that uses genetic engineering for conservation projects. He plans to apply Gilbert and colleagues’ analysis to his own work on the passenger pigeon, which went extinct in 1914. There are possible solutions for how to capture some of the missing data, he says, but the fact that some data will always be missing is a limitation that de-extinction scientists have already come to terms with.</p>



<p>“The reference assembly problem will always be a barrier to de-extinction,” Novak says. “Anyone pursuing de-extinction has to settle on the fact that we want to get as close as we can to something that fools the environment.”</p>



<p>In other words, a de-extinct mammoth created using gene editing, if such a thing ever comes to be, won’t exactly be a mammoth; it will be closer to a hairy Asian elephant adapted to live in the cold. And the new analysis suggests that the proxy animal version will probably have enough differences that would make it difficult for the creature to refill its previous ecological niche.

                <p><em>By</em> <a href="https://twitter.com/mattbwarren">Matthew Warren</a></p>



<p>After finding out details about a stranger, we mistakenly think that they also know about us. As a result, we act more honestly around them, according to a <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-022-04452-3">recent study</a> in <em>Nature</em>. And this can have a real-world impact: the team finds that after residents are given biographical information about neighbourhood police officers, the crime rate in nearby areas reduces.</p>



<span id="more-45666"></span>



<p>Past research has found that we tend to assume social relationships are reciprocal. Most of the time, this assumption is accurate: someone you think of as a friend will usually consider you a friend too, for instance. But sometimes our social ties are more one-sided: for example, you might learn something about a stranger who doesn’t know you at all. Anuj K. Shah from the University of Chicago and Michael LaForest from Pennsylvania State University wondered whether, in this situation, our tendency to believe that social ties are symmetrical could lead us to mistakenly feel that a stranger does actually know us.</p>



<p>In a series of lab-based studies, this is exactly what the researchers found. In each experiment, online participants were ostensibly paired with another participant (in reality, this partner didn’t exist). Some participants were given information about their partner while others were not, before rating how well this stranger knew them.</p>



<p>In one set of studies, participants answered three multiple-choice questions about their lives; half then saw their partner’s responses to the same questions and half did not. All participants were then told that their partner was trying to guess their own answers. Participants who saw their partner’s responses believed that this stranger understood them better than those who did not.</p>



<p>In further experiments, participants wrote down four true statements and one lie about themselves. Some participants also saw statements supposedly written by a partner. Again, this group believed that the partner would be more likely to guess which of their own statements was a lie than those who didn’t read their partner’s statements. And in another study, the team found that people were more likely to give honest answers to a question if they had read information about their partner — and this effect seemed at least partly driven by the fact that these participants felt their partner knew them better.</p>



<p>These studies all suggested that when we know about strangers, we erroneously think they also know about us. But the really interesting finding came when the researchers stepped out of the lab, to conduct a field experiment in collaboration with the New York City Police Department and Housing Authority. The team developed leaflets containing fairly mundane information about local community police officers, such as their favourite food, hobbies, or reasons for joining the police force. They then sent out these leaflets to every apartment in a number of housing developments in disadvantaged areas. The officers themselves also dropped off cards to local residents containing similar information.</p>



<p>Two months later, the researchers surveyed residents at these housing developments as well as control areas that did not receive leaflets or outreach cards. Residents imagined they had committed a crime that they could be fined for, and were asked how likely it would be that local officers would find out about it. They also rated how well the officers in the area knew them.</p>



<p>The team found that residents of the developments that had received the intervention believed it more likely that local officers would find out about illegal activity than residents of the control areas (though there was no significant effect on residents’ perceptions of how well police officers knew them). Even more strikingly, the team found that immediately after the intervention, there were fewer criminal complaints and arrests in the areas around the developments that had received the intervention than around the control developments.</p>



<p>Giving people information about local police therefore seems to reduce their own sense of anonymity, and by doing so may even reduce crime rates. It’s worth noting that the reduction in crime was only seen in the first three months after the information was sent out, so this may not be a long-term solution. And, as the authors acknowledge, increasing trust in the police requires much broader reforms and changes at a societal level.</p>



<p>Still, the reduction in crime in this study was comparable to the reduction seen when police forces increase their presence in crime hotspots. This suggests that giving people more information about their local officers could be a straightforward method to achieve similar results, “without increasing the number of potentially fraught officer–citizen interactions”, the researchers conclude.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/mirror-beetle-shiny-camouflage-ecology">Mirror beetles’ shiny bodies may not act as camouflage after all</a></h4>

              
                <p>This is a story about camouflage, but forget mud-blob brown, mealy beige and somber green.&nbsp; Here scientists study mirror glitz and the paradoxical notion that there’s a shiny side to camo.</p>



<p>Mirrorlike surfaces have evolved in open-ocean fishes as well as in spiders, butterfly chrysalises and most branches of the vast diversity of beetles, says visual ecologist Amanda Franklin of the University of Melbourne. One popular idea proposes that these living mirrors might confound predators by reflecting water, leaves, twigs or whatever.</p>

<p>For a test of dry-land mirrors, Franklin and her colleagues turned to a showy group of about 40 species of scarab beetles, some with a natural gleam. In golds, bronzes, greens and blues, they climb into eucalyptus trees to flirt and mate during their native Australia’s high summer in December. “People love Christmas beetles,” Franklin says.</p>



<p>To see if good reflection gives protection, Franklin set out to create nubs of clay roughly the shape of two greenish Christmas beetles, one with a mirror finish and one matte like their real-life counterparts, <em>Anoplognathus parvulus</em> (shiny) and <em>A. prasinus</em> (dull).</p>







<p>Creating a “brushed-metal” look was easy, but she needed fake beetles with a full muscle car metal shine. Also she needed something fast to make. “If you have to sand it all day, you’re not going to be able to make a thousand,&#8221; Franklin says.</p>



<p>But prototype after prototype failed to shine. After about six weeks of frustration, “we probably had hundreds in the throw-out bin.” Working with a specialist in a hobby shop where her father for years bought supplies for making model World War II planes finally cracked the mirror mystery.</p>



<p>The trick to beetle-grade reflectivity turned out to be finding just the right super-smooth resin to coat the models before spray-painting. Then just a bit of sanding the shiny models approximated the relative difference between the mirror species and its drabber relative.</p>

<p>Franklin and her colleagues then set out more than a thousand models for six days in two regions of Australia and in both leafy and open areas. In areas with such beetle eaters as butcherbirds and cuckoo-shrikes, the researchers checked for beak marks indicating bird attacks. The mirror finish, however, <a href="https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1365-2435.13963">didn’t show a clear benefit</a>, Franklin and colleagues reported in the January 2022 <em>Functional Ecology</em>. The soft “bodies” of the glossy fakes had just about as many gashes and dings from bird strikes as the matte finish models did.</p>



<p>A test with people as pretend predators wearing eye-tracker rigs also failed to show that shiny things were harder to find than the scuffed, duller beetles. All faux beetles at least avoided being hungrily speared once spotted. “The benefit is that you can tell a human what to do,” Franklin says.</p>



<p>Mirror camo might still work in some predicaments, but Franklin is now wondering if the big advantage of mirror bodies perhaps has little to do with their looks. The complicated microstructures that create the mirrors might, for instance, reduce the danger of cracks or fungal cooties. <em>Homo sapiens</em> fixates on looks, but maybe the visual thrill of a Christmas beetle’s mirror is just a holiday bonus.</p>

                <p>This week on Journal Club session Olga Tveretina will talk about her work on &quot;Complexity of the Reachability and Mortality Problems for Hybrid Dynamical Systems&quot;,</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>The mortality problem for a given dynamical system S consists of determining
whether every trajectory of S eventually halts.  The mortality problem is
relevant to the field of program termination, and it has been studied in
different contexts and in different variants. Closely related to mortality is
the reachability problem: does exist a trajectory starting at a given initial
state which evolves to reach a given final state. Both problems are undecidable
in general, and they are only decidable for a limited number of classes of
hybrid dynamical systems.</p>
<p>My recent related work includes results on decidability of mortality and
reachability for some hybrid dynamical systems on manifolds [1, 2].  The
complexity of these problems has received less attention of the community than
the fundamental issue of their decidability. Studying the computational
complexity of the algorithms for deciding reachability and mortality problems
presented in [1, 2] is one of my current research focuses.</p>
<p>In my talk I will discuss the computational complexity of reachability and
mortality for the closely related systems, so-called Restricted Hierarchical
Hybrid Systems. These models have been studied by P. Bell, Sh. Chen, and L.
Jackson [3], and they are a useful tool for exploring the complexity of such
problems for other kinds of systems.</p>
<p>While the current aims are to improve understanding the boundary between
decidable and undecidable systems and their computational complexity, it is
worth mentioning that hybrid dynamical systems on manifolds have important
practical applications. Areas where surfaces arise include among others
biological systems (modelling processes on cell membranes), robotics (the
configuration space of a robotic arm) and learning algorithms (finding a
low-dimensional parameterization of high-dimensional data).</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/mountain-goats-vanishing-indigenous-land-culture-canada">Culturally prized mountain goats may be vanishing from Indigenous land in Canada</a></h4>

              
                <p>For thousands of years, members of the Kitasoo/Xai’xais First Nation in Canada have prized the mountain goats that roam the craggy peaks of British Columbia’s central coast.</p>



<p>The animals have long been an important food source, explains Kitasoo/Xai’xais Chief Councillor Doug Neasloss. And “we use the mountain goat in a lot of our cultural events — songs and dances and stories.”</p>



<p>Formerly a wildlife tour guide, Neasloss remembers seeing lots of the goats in the region in past decades, but no longer. And many in the community have noticed a similar trend.</p>





<p>Goats in Kitasoo/Xai’xais territory are thought to occur at lower densities than farther east in the goats’ range in the higher Rocky Mountains. But there has been “almost zero research” on British Columbia’s coastal mountain goats (<em>Oreamnos americanus</em>), until now, says Tyler Jessen, a conservation biologist at the University of Victoria in Canada.</p>



<p>Kitasoo/Xai’xais community members partnered with Jessen and his colleagues to <a href="https://conbio.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/csp2.12662">investigate the mountain goats’ status</a>. Numbers of the animals do seem to have undergone a decline since the 1980s, the team reports March 8 in <em>Conservation Science and Practice</em>. The reasons why remain unknown but might be a result of a warming climate, the researchers say.</p>



<p>To estimate contemporary goat numbers and density, the researchers conducted aerial surveys in 2019 and 2020, scrutinizing habitats higher than 1,000 meters above sea level in Kitasoo/Xai’xais territory near Klemtu, British Columbia. To estimate how goat numbers have changed over time, the research team interviewed individuals from the local community who regularly hunt wildlife, guide, conduct research or fish the region. For each decade back to the 1980s, participants gave estimates for how many days out of 10 they saw goats.</p>

<p>Finally, to draw inferences about goat trends over a broader geographic scale, the researchers analyzed mountain goat hunting data across British Columbia from 1980 to 2018.</p>



<p>“One of the biggest challenges we have in science, especially with population trends, is that knowledge is primarily based on the length of the study, which can be extremely limited,” says Elizabeth Flesch, a wildlife geneticist at Montana State University in Bozeman who was not involved in the study.</p>



<p>That’s especially true for species tricky to count in remote, rugged habitats, like mountain goats, she says. Flesch commended the triad of independent methods that the researchers used to tackle that challenge.</p>



<p>The helicopter surveys tallied 0.25 goats per square kilometer, a low-density population. Interviews revealed that “the number of sightings of mountain goats has declined hugely since the 1980s,” says Jessen, when some Kitasoo/Xai’xais people reported seeing goats six days out of 10. That compares with 2019, “when nobody [who was interviewed] saw any goats,” Jessen says.</p>



<p>Hunting data obtained from the government of British Columbia revealed that success rates of nonresident hunters killing goats with the help of professional guides increased from the 1980s to 1990s in coastal regions all across British Columbia, and then remained relatively constant. In contrast, kills per days spent hunting have slowly and steadily declined throughout the province for resident hunters, who do not use professional guides, paralleling the Kitasoo/Xai’xais community members’ sense of declining goat numbers more locally.</p>



<p>Still, Jessen cautions, the analyses cannot distinguish population declines from shifts in distribution, meaning the coastal goats on Kitasoo/Xai’xais territory may have just relocated elsewhere, or relocated and declined. If the goat numbers are declining, the potential reasons are yet unknown, but being at low density, Jessen says, makes the goats especially vulnerable to any stressors.</p>



<p>The team suspects that climate change may be playing a role, though more research is needed. Christina Service, a wildlife biologist with the Kitasoo/Xai’xais First Nation Stewardship Authority, says during the summer of 2019, high temperatures meant “near heatstroke for humans” hiking at those high elevations.</p>





<p>“In hot temperatures, mountain goats can be thermally stressed,” says wildlife biologist Kevin White, formerly with the Alaska Department of Fish and Game. His long-term work in coastal Alaska following GPS-collared goats suggests that hot summers decrease mountain goat winter survival. But goat survival can also depend on predation, industrial disturbances and tourism, among other factors, says White, who wasn’t involved in the new study.</p>



<p>Kitasoo/Xai’xais members have voluntarily halted goat hunting in their territory over the last two decades to avoid endangering the goats. The group is also urging provincial authorities in British Columbia to take local knowledge into account, and suspend provincially sanctioned nonresident hunting in territories like theirs where goat numbers appear low.</p>



<p>Though focused on mountain goats, the study’s methods could shed light on <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/silver-backed-chevrotains-have-been-rediscovered-science-after-29-years">any poorly understood wildlife population</a>, Service says (<em>SN: 11/11/19</em>) “There are lots of areas of the world where we don’t have long-term baseline information, and where there are really rich local knowledge sources.”</p>



<p>It’s a case study of what can happen, she says, “when you harness the power of different ways of knowing.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/fossil-octopus-cephalopod-ancestor-10-arms-debate-identity">Scientists are arguing over the identity of a fossilized 10-armed creature</a></h4>

              
                <p>An ancient cephalopod fossil may be about to rewrite octopus history, but it depends on who you ask. At the very least, it’s offering up a lesson in how hard it is to classify some fossils.</p>



<p>Because their soft bodies decay easily, it’s rare to find well-preserved fossils of cephalopods, a group that includes octopus, squid and cuttlefish. The relatively slim pickings of fossils have made establishing the animals’ family tree a headache for paleontologists.</p>



<p>Enter <em>Syllipsimopodi bideni</em>, an approximately 330-million-year-old fossil with exquisitely preserved suckers and 10 arms. The specimen was donated to the Royal Ontario Museum in Toronto in 1988 after its discovery in Montana’s Bear Gulch Limestone, a treasure trove for soft-bodied fossils. A closer look suggests that <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-022-28333-5">the fossil is a type of cephalopod called a vampyropod</a>, researchers from the American Museum of Natural History in New York City report March 8 in <em>Nature Communications</em>.</p>





<p>If true, that would make this newly designated species the oldest ancestor of octopuses by about 80 million years. This would suggest that some ancient octopus features evolved much more quickly than previously thought. “This is overturning about 100 years of science in cephalopod evolution,” says invertebrate paleontologist Christopher Whalen. But not everyone is convinced.</p>



<p>The classification hinges on the fossil having a gladius, a hard internal body part shaped like a Roman sword of the same name. The gladius can be identified by slender growth lines along the fossil’s edge, as well as a rib running down the center of the fossil.</p>



<p>But where Whalen and paleontologist Neil Landman see a gladius, others see something else.</p>



<p>“That’s not the gladius, I’m sorry,” says Christian Klug, a cephalopod paleontologist at the University of Zurich. He argues that the slender lines are actually evidence of a flattened phragmocone, the series of chambers found in the shells of early cephalopods. And if there’s no gladius, as Klug suggests, the fossil would not be a vampyropod after all.</p>



<p>Different interpretations of fossils are not uncommon in paleontology. A famous example is <em>Tullimonstrum</em>, more commonly known as the Tully monster. First discovered in 1955, paleontologists <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/identity-tully-monster-still-mystery">still disagree</a> about whether it’s a vertebrate (<em>SN: 3/6/17</em>).</p>



<p>“They&#8217;re all looking at the same fossils and the same features,” says Roy Plotnick, an invertebrate paleontologist at the University of Illinois Chicago. But something as simple as orientation can affect the interpretation of a fossil. Plotnick is working on a study about a fossil that was classified as a jellyfish for almost 50 years; upon flipping it upside down, he realized it’s actually a sea anemone.</p>



<p>Identifying fossil features is much more than eyeballing. For starters, paleontologists have a deep-seated knowledge of anatomy, biology and zoology. “Many of us know animal anatomy better than most biologists do,” Plotnick says. Paleontologists also need to understand the processes of fossilization and how animals decay. If a feature is missing, a paleontologist will consider whether it was absent in the animal when it was alive or just not preserved.</p>



<p>“You need to come up with a frame of reference, some sort of interpretive framework, which is based on what you see,” Whalen says. For instance, the preserved suckers allowed him to identify <em>S. bideni</em> as a cephalopod. “Once you&#8217;ve gotten that, then you can start to focus on interpreting the different structures under that framework.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Prioritizing one piece of evidence over another can become somewhat subjective. “Even with well-preserved species, you can get terrific differences in interpretation,” says Kevin Padian, a vertebrate paleontologist at the University of California, Berkeley. Some scientists prefer not to stray from traditional means of classification. Some choose to emphasize certain parts of the anatomy over others. Some opt to lump specimens together into the same species, whereas others will differentiate them more readily.</p>



<p>Ultimately, the strength of the interpretation depends on how reasonable it is. “I usually use the phrase: What is consistent with the evidence that we have?” Plotnick says.</p>



<p>It might not sound like an exact science, but that’s the trick: Only the addition of evidence can increase certainty. In the case of <em>S. bideni</em>, the discovery of more specimens could help researchers home in on the correct interpretation. Sophisticated technologies could also help. In the last decade, new imaging techniques have been developed to look at the chemical makeup of fossils, allowing scientists to identify previously hidden details.</p>



<p>Still, “there often isn&#8217;t a definitive answer, because there&#8217;s just not enough evidence to decide for sure,” Padian says. “Nobody speaks ex cathedra in science.”</p>

                <p><em>By</em> <a href="https://emmayoung.net/">Emma Young</a></p>



<p>Babies, monkeys and <a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2013.00162/full">even bees</a> have a basic &#8220;sense of number&#8221;. They can instantly perceive that there are one, two, three or four objects in a pile, without having to count them. They can also tell at a glance that a pile of 50 objects contains more than a pile of 20, say. But what explains the unique ability of older kids and adults to go far beyond this, and mentally represent quantities much bigger than four <em>exactly</em>? Some researchers argue that language must be key — that learning to count &#8220;one&#8221;, &#8220;two&#8221;, &#8220;three&#8221;, and on and on, enables this cognitive feat. Others argue that language can’t be fundamental to this &#8220;numerical&#8221; ability.</p>



<p>Now a striking <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/09567976211034502">new study</a> in <em>Psychological Science</em> by Benjamin Pitt at the University of California, Berkeley, and colleagues comes down firmly on the side of language as being key. And this has a broader significance. It supports the hotly contested idea that language itself influences or even enables abilities that have been viewed as being completely independent — such as colour perception, or, in this case, understanding of number.</p>



<span id="more-45635"></span>



<p>Earlier studies have suggested that a knowledge of number words is important for understanding exact numbers above four. But these studies have suffered from various drawbacks. Take work on the Pirahã, an indigenous group living in the Brazilian Amazon who have no words for any exact quantity, not even &#8220;one&#8221;. Pirahã adults seem to be able to mentally represent only up to about four objects. But as Pitt and his colleagues note, they <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2021/01/21/episode-23-whose-psychology-is-it-anyway-making-psychological-research-more-representative/">differ from WEIRD comparison groups</a> in all sorts of ways, beyond differences in number language. Some researchers have suggested that their performance might reflect simply their society’s &#8220;indifference&#8221; to exact large numbers, rather than an inability to form concepts of them, for example. </p>



<p>Pitt and his team turned to the Tsimane&#8217;, a society of farmer-foragers who live in the remote Bolivian Amazon (but who, it has to be said, have featured in all manner of studies looking at cross-cultural differences in perception, <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2019/10/17/culture-plays-an-important-role-in-our-perception-of-musical-pitch-according-to-study-of-bolivias-tsimane-people/">including music perception</a>; they may not be familiar with Western culture but they must be getting <em>very</em> familiar with Western researchers).</p>



<p>Ideally for the team’s research purposes, the Tsimane&#8217; language features a full number system, but while some adults have an excellent knowledge of it and can count indefinitely, others have a very limited knowledge of number words. This allowed the team to compare the performance of &#8220;high&#8221; vs &#8220;low&#8221; counters within the same culture.</p>



<p>To do this, they gave adult participants pebble-matching tasks. The strongest test of exact number understanding was an &#8220;orthogonal-matching task&#8221;. A line of white pebbles was placed vertically, stretching away from the participant. Their task was to use glass pebbles to create a matching horizontal line beneath. To succeed at this task, a participant had to understand the exact number of white pebbles, and place the same number of glass pebbles in their line.</p>



<p>The team first ascertained the participant’s highest verbal word count. Then high counters (who could count above 40) started with a line of 10 white pebbles, while low counters started with two fewer pebbles than their highest verbal word count (which ranged from 6 to 20). From this point on, if they placed the correct number of glass pebbles to match the white ones,  the team increased the number of pebbles in the next array by two. If they were wrong, they were given one fewer pebble in their next array. This continued until a participant did one of three things: they did not make a perfect match for the same number of pebbles three times; they correctly matched three arrays of 20 pebbles or more; they completed 20 trials.</p>



<p>The team were then able to compare each participant’s verbal word count with the number of pebbles at which they started to make mistakes — the point at which they switched from exactly reproducing the target array to approximating it.</p>



<p>The results were clear: the switch point for high counters was far higher — averaging 28, compared with just 7 (and never exceeding 11) for the low counters. Importantly, with one exception, the participants’ switch points were <em>at or below</em> their highest verbal word count — even for pebble sets smaller than ten. When the number of target pebbles approached or reached the number that they had a word for, they started approximating. And this led to the team to an important conclusion: within this group “the ability to represent exact numbers was limited to the part of the verbal count list they had mastered”. This, they argue, “represents the strongest evidence to date that number words play a functional role in representing large exact numbers”.</p>



<p>Given the debate over the extent to which language might underpin or enable very different abilities, this is a really significant finding. It doesn’t mean that language is the <em>only</em> tool that can enable understanding of large exact numbers, however. Patterns of counters on an abacus, for example, work as wordless symbols of even extremely large numbers. But as the team writes, their new findings suggest that “whatever set of symbols people use, their ability to represent large exact numbers extends only as far as their mastery of those symbols”.</p>



<p>&#8211; <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/09567976211034502">Exact Number Concepts Are Limited to the Verbal Count Range</a></p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/star-red-giant-age-gas-rings-new-image-white-dwarf">A new image captures enormous gas rings encircling an aging red star</a></h4>

              
                <p>Huge rings of gas surround a large red star named V Hydrae, new images show, signaling its eventual transformation into a much smaller and bluer star.</p>



<p>“It’s definitely going through its metamorphosis,” says Raghvendra Sahai, an astronomer at NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, Calif. “Such ringlike structures have never been seen in any object like this before.”</p>



<p>Observations of the three concentric rings, all ejected from the star during the last 800 years, could help astronomers understand how giant stars lose mass toward the end of their lives and seed the cosmos with planet- and life-building elements.</p>





<p>Born roughly twice as massive as the sun and lying about 1,300 light-years from Earth, V Hydrae is what’s known as an asymptotic giant branch star. It once fused hydrogen in its core, as the sun does. But now it is a cool, brilliant, puffed-up star that alternately burns hydrogen and helium in shells around a carbon-oxygen core. Such stars cast lots of material into space.</p>



<p>“The processes by which this happens are not well-understood,” says Sahai, who has studied V Hydrae since the 1980s.</p>



<p>His team used the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array of radio telescopes in Chile, also known as ALMA, to detect the <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.09335">three rings of gas</a>. Beyond them lie three additional rings, which are fainter and seen only partially, Sahai and colleagues report in a paper submitted February 18 at arXiv.org.</p>



<p>The outermost complete ring now sits about 260 billion kilometers from the star, or 1,740 times as far as Earth is from the sun — more than 40 times Pluto’s distance from Earth. By measuring the speed at which the three complete rings are moving outward and their current distances from the star, the astronomers calculate that it cast them off about 270, 485 and 780 years ago.</p>



<p>It’s thought that another star orbits the main one every few hundred years on an elliptical orbit. When the companion dives in, it can trigger the giant star to cast more material into space, the team says.</p>



<p>The new image is striking and unusual, and it illustrates how a companion star enhances a giant star’s loss of mass, says Joel Kastner, an astronomer at the Rochester Institute of Technology in New York who was not part of the study. “Mass loss is very important because it’s how the elements of life get distributed from stars into the universe.”</p>



<p>Stars like V Hydrae <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/number-milky-way-nova-explosions-per-year-pinned-down">forged most of the nitrogen</a> in Earth’s air as well as <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/star-mass-binary-system-carbon-factories-space">much of our planet’s carbon</a>, the basis for all terrestrial life (<em>SN: 2/12/21</em>;<em> SN: 11/18/21</em>). V Hydrae has so many carbon compounds in its atmosphere that it’s classified as a carbon star. It’s also one of the reddest stars known because those compounds as well as dust particles absorb its blue and violet light.</p>



<p>Sahai expects the star’s ejection of material to continue, but, he says, “it’s anybody’s guess as to how many more rings will be produced.”</p>



<p>When the star loses all of its atmosphere, probably many thousands of years from now, it will expose its hot core, whose ultraviolet light will set the cast-off material aglow, creating a beautiful bubble of gas known as a planetary nebula.</p>



<p>When the nebula dissipates, all that will remain of the magnificent red star will be a tiny blue one — a white dwarf — a little larger than Earth, plus innumerable life-giving elements floating through the Milky Way.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/ukraine-russia-war-nuclear-power-weapons-risk-physics">Russia’s war in Ukraine raises nuclear risks, physicists warn</a></h4>

              
                <p>Russia’s war with Ukraine is heightening nuclear fears on two fronts. Attacks on nuclear facilities have raised concerns about accidents, and threats from Russian President Vladimir Putin have amped up worries over the potential for nuclear warfare.</p>



<p>Physicists historically have played a role in creating these technologies, and in keeping humankind safe from the dangers posed by them. Here’s what two key physicists have to say about the nuclear issues raised by the war in Ukraine.</p>



<h4>Nuclear power</h4>





<p>On March 4, Russian forces shelled Ukraine’s Zaporizhzhya&nbsp;nuclear power plant, causing a fire in one of the site’s buildings. The largest nuclear plant in Europe, it normally provides more than 20 percent of Ukraine’s power. Radiation levels have <a href="https://snriu.gov.ua/en/news/updated-information-about-zaporizhzhia-npp-znpp">remained normal</a>, according to the State Nuclear Regulatory Inspectorate of Ukraine. But the danger to Ukraine’s nuclear power plants is not over, Edwin Lyman of the Union of Concerned Scientists said in a March 4 news briefing.</p>



<p>“These plants are now in a situation that few people ever seriously contemplated when they were originally built, and that is the potential that they would be in the middle of a war zone,” said Lyman, a physicist by training. “No nuclear plant has been designed to withstand the potential threat of a full-scale military attack, and the plants in Ukraine are no exception.”</p>



<div class="wp-block-sciencenews-content-sidebar">
<h3>Nuclear zones</h3>



<p>Ukraine has four active nuclear power plants — Zaporizhzhya, Rivno, Khmelnitsky and South Ukraine — and an additional nuclear facility at Chernobyl, the site of a 1986 accident that contaminated the area.</p>

<p>The Zaporizhzhya&nbsp;plant in southern Ukraine is now under Russian control. Ukraine informed the International Atomic Energy Agency that Russian forces are <a href="https://www.iaea.org/newscenter/pressreleases/update-13-iaea-director-general-statement-on-situation-in-ukraine">requiring approval</a> for any actions taken by the plant management, the agency reported in a March 6 statement. Additionally, Russian forces have cut off internet access and certain other connections with the outside world, making communication with the site’s operators difficult, the statement said.</p>



<p>If workers’ access to the site is restricted, that could jeopardize the safety of the plant in various ways, Lyman warned. “It’s important to recognize that even if a nuclear reactor is shut down … that core still requires cooling to prevent dangerous overheating of the fuel that could lead to fuel damage and potential radiological release.”</p>



<p>To ensure safety, workers must be able to apply any emergency measures needed to maintain cooling. In 2011, in the aftermath of an earthquake and tsunami, reactors at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant in Japan <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/japan-struggles-control-earthquake-damaged-nuke-plant">endured explosions</a>, melting of reactor cores and the release of radioactive material when a loss of power prevented workers from maintaining cooling (<em>SN: 3/14/11</em>).</p>



<p>What’s more, if the Zaporizhzhya&nbsp;plant’s operators are not allowed to freely come and go, “the personnel on-site might not have the opportunity to be relieved of their duties and this could lead, obviously, to fatigue compounded by the stress of working under duress,” Lyman said. Under such conditions, operators might be more likely to make mistakes, creating a situation ripe for dangerous nuclear accidents.</p>





<p>Lyman raised similar concerns over worker fatigue at the site of the 1986 <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/chernobyl-may-be-worst-nuclear-accident">Chernobyl accident</a> in Ukraine (<em>SN: 5/3/86</em>). On February 24, Russian forces occupied that site, which still demands a crew of workers to maintain and monitor it to prevent any further nuclear incidents. On March 7, Ukraine’s nuclear regulator reported that workers had been <a href="https://snriu.gov.ua/en/news/chornobyl-npp-facilities-current-situation-7-march-2022-1300">on-site for 12 days without a staff rotation</a>.</p>



<p>Russian forces also shelled a nuclear facility at the Kharkiv Institute of Physics and Technology, a source of neutrons used for research, the nuclear regulator reported March 6. The radiation levels at the site <a href="https://snriu.gov.ua/en/news/updated-information-neutron-source-site">are normal</a>, the regulator said March 7.</p>



<p>Overall, around half of Ukraine’s electricity comes from nuclear energy: The country has four active nuclear power plants, comprising 15 nuclear reactors. As of March 7, Russian forces appeared to be approaching another nuclear plant, the South Ukraine nuclear power plant, in Yuzhnoukrains’k, <a href="https://www.cnn.com/europe/live-news/ukraine-russia-putin-news-03-04-22/h_5b49ad14b52420ba1a080e51c6e63180">CNN reported</a> March 4. “The Ukrainian authorities have called for the establishment of what they call ‘safe zones’ around each nuclear power plant,” Lyman said. The issues faced by the nuclear sites “demonstrate how important that is.”</p>



<h4>Nuclear warfare</h4>



<p>While the danger of a nuclear accident is alarming enough on its own, the threat of nuclear weapons is adding to the worries.</p>



<p>The global unease was almost palpable after Vladimir Putin declared February 27 that he had ordered Russia’s nuclear forces to a state of high alert or “special combat readiness.” Nuclear threats are not to be taken lightly, especially those involving Russia and the United States, which together host the vast majority of the world’s nuclear weapons.</p>



<p>But, says physicist Frank von Hippel, an emeritus professor of public and international affairs at Princeton University, the finger was already on the trigger even before Putin’s declaration.</p>



<p>Russia and the United States each have several hundred nuclear warheads in what’s called a “launch-on-warning” posture, in which a retaliatory barrage of nuclear missiles can be launched as soon as warning systems detect an enemy launch. You don’t get higher alert than that,” von Hippel says. “That’s routine, day-to-day, irrespective of international events.”</p>

<p>While it’s not clear exactly what Russia’s “special combat readiness” means in practice, von Hippel says that the country could ready additional weapons — for example by getting bombers loaded up at the end of runways. But the hair-trigger capacity for widespread nuclear destruction is already present.</p>



<p>Still, nuclear provocations like Putin’s matter, von Hippel says. “It does increase the danger of accidental nuclear war.” If an early-warning system misidentifies a nuclear attack, responders could initiate nuclear annihilation based on a misunderstanding. And in light of Russia’s heightened nuclear status, the response in the United States to a warning might be less skeptical. “The ground might already have been prepared psychologically … to expect that this is actually the real thing.”</p>



<p>In the 1980s, when nuclear arsenals were at their peak, the United States and the former Soviet Union together had about 70,000 warheads. Now, the entire world’s cache is closer to 10,000. But the numbers have stopped going down, says von Hippel, “and 10,000 is still enough to destroy civilization and cause billions of deaths.”</p>



<p>With the help of the American Physical Society, von Hippel and others formed the <a href="https://www.aps.org/policy/nuclear/index.cfm">Physicists Coalition for Nuclear Threat Reduction</a>, a group that includes around 650 physicists. The researchers lobby the U.S. Congress for changes in nuclear policy, for example, arguing for a “no-first-use” policy that would declare that U.S. nuclear weapons would be used only in response to another nuclear attack.</p>



<p>“The nuclear weapons era has just gone on too long,” von Hippel says. “We’ve been very lucky that there hasn’t been a nuclear war, but we can’t keep depending on luck given the consequences of all the destructive power that we’ve built up.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2022/03/expanding-medrxiv-at-plos/">New options for posting a medRxiv preprint at PLOS</a></h4>

              
                <p>Starting today, <em>PLOS Global Public Health</em> and <em>PLOS Digital Health</em>, will <a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2022/01/plos-and-medrxiv/">join the other PLOS journals publishing medical research</a> in giving submitting authors the option to have their manuscript forwarded to medRxiv to be considered for posting as a preprint. In offering this free service, we aim to make preprint posting simple and easy, giving researchers more flexibility in how they choose to communicate their science. Researchers, of course, also remain free to post to medRxiv or another preprint server prior to submitting.</p>



<p>The initial integration between PLOS and medRxiv, implemented earlier this year, has already received an enthusiastic response from our community. In less than two months, the authors of over 250 manuscripts submitted to <em>PLOS Medicine</em>, <em>PLOS NTD</em>s and <em>PLOS ONE</em> have elected to have their submissions sent on to medRxiv.<strong><a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2022/03/expanding-medrxiv-at-plos/#asterisk">*</a></strong>&nbsp;</p>



<p>It&rsquo;s easy to see why. Preprints bring both individual and community benefits. Authors can use preprints as a tool to establish priority, broadcast results, seek feedback, increase readership, and bolster grant, job or tenure applications. More broadly, preprints support efficient and inclusive scientific communications. Publicly sharing a research manuscript before peer review surfaces results sooner, opening opportunities for collaboration and facilitating peer review.</p>



<p>The immediacy and accessibility of preprints, combined with expert checks that help to ensure responsible preprint posting, make medRxiv a particularly strong partner for journals like <em>PLOS Global Public Health</em> and <em>PLOS Digital Health</em>, that prioritize openness and inclusion, technological innovation, and scientific rigor.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image is-style-default"><figure class="alignright size-full"><img loading="lazy" width="80" height="80" src="https://theplosblog.plos.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2022/02/Madhukar-Pai-GPH_profile.png" alt="" class="wp-image-20141"></figure></div>



<p>&ldquo;During the pandemic, we have all seen the value of rapid communication of medical research via preprints. But we have also seen the need for careful and rigorous peer review in tackling bad science. By integrating medRxiv with <em>PLOS GPH</em>, we are supporting both goals &ndash; rapid sharing of research as well as thoughtful peer-review before publication.&rdquo; </p>



<p>&ndash; Madhu Pai, Editor-in-Chief, <em>PLOS Global Public Health</em></p>



<p></p>



<div class="wp-block-image is-style-default"><figure class="alignleft size-full is-resized"><img loading="lazy" src="https://theplosblog.plos.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2022/02/Leo-Anthony-Celi_-PLOS-Digital-Health_profile.png" alt="" class="wp-image-20136" width="80" height="80"></figure></div>



<p>&ldquo;Among the core values of <em>PLOS Digital Health</em> is the promotion of ethically conducted, inclusive, and immediately accessible research. As the COVID-19 pandemic has demonstrated, there is a critical need for the scientific community to be able to leverage information and communication technology to create and validate knowledge that is rapidly evolving. The use of preprint servers, most notably medRxiv, is integral to this vision of a near real-time iterative knowledge system, as they facilitate the immediate dissemination, public discussion, and open discourse of emerging studies. As the analyses iterate based on feedback from the research community, however, it remains important that they undergo formal peer review before entering into the permanent scientific record. With the collaboration between <em>PLOS Digital Health</em> and medRxiv, we are able to synergistically achieve both goals&mdash;ensuring that practice-informing results are not delayed from preliminary contributions to the discourse by the inherent time delays of the publication process.&rdquo;</p>



<p>&ndash; Leo Anthony Celi,&nbsp; Editor-in-Chief, <em>PLOS Digital Health</em></p>



<p>Going forward, we&rsquo;ll continue to grow our open research offerings for authors across all PLOS journals, including integrations with community-supported preprint servers spanning a broader range of subject areas, and more tools and services to support research integrity, access, and inclusivity.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/octopus-deep-sea-mom-eggs-warm-water-garden-development">Some deep-sea octopuses aren’t the long-haul moms scientists thought they were</a></h4>

              
                <p>Octopuses living in the deep sea off the coast of California are breeding far faster than expected.</p>



<p>The animals lay their eggs near geothermal springs, and <a href="https://osm2022.secure-platform.com/a/gallery/rounds/3/details/4495">the warmer water speeds up embryonic development</a>, researchers report February 28 at the virtual 2022 Ocean Sciences Meeting. That reproductive sleight of hand means that the octopus moms brood for less than two years, instead of the estimated 12.</p>



<p>In 2018, scientists working off the coast of California discovered thousands of deep-sea octopuses (<em>Muusoctopus robustus</em>) congregated on a patch of seafloor about 3,200 meters below the surface. Many of the grapefruit-sized animals were females brooding clutches of eggs, leading researchers to dub the site the Octopus Garden.</p>





<p>But with water temperatures hovering around a frigid 1.6° Celsius, growth in this garden was predicted to be leisurely. In octopuses, embryonic development tends to slow down at low temperatures, says marine ecologist Jim Barry of the Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute in Moss Landing, Calif. “When you get really cold, down near zero, that’s when brood periods get really long.”</p>



<p>The record for the longest brood period of any animal, just over four years, is held by a different species of octopus <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/octomom-sets-egg-brooding-record">living in warmer water</a> (<em>SN: 7/30/14</em>). <em>M. robustus</em>, thriving in the chilly depths of the Octopus Garden, was therefore a serious contender to snatch that title, Barry says. “If you look at its predicted brood period at 1.6° C, it’s over 12 years.”</p>



<p>To verify what would be a record-setting stint of motherhood, Barry and his colleagues repeatedly visited the Octopus Garden from 2019 to 2021 using a remotely operated vehicle. The team trained cameras at the octopus eggs, which resemble white fingers, to monitor their rate of development. With one of the submersible’s robotic arms, the researchers also gently nudged dozens of octopuses aside and measured the water temperature in their nests.</p>



<p>The team found that relatively warm water — up to 10.5° C — bathed all the egg clutches. The female octopuses are preferentially laying their eggs in streams of geothermally heated water, the researchers realized. That discovery was a tip-off that these animals are not the long-haul moms people thought them to be, Barry says. “We’re virtually certain these animals are breeding far more rapidly than you’d expect.”</p>

<p>Based on observations of the developing eggs, Barry and colleagues calculated that the moms brooded for only about 600 days, or about a year and a half. That is much faster than predicted, says Jeffrey Drazen, a deep-sea ecologist at the University of Hawaii at Manoa who was not involved in the research. “They’re cutting a huge amount of time off of their parental care period.”</p>



<p>There is also an evolutionary advantage to seeking out warmer water: Shorter brood periods mean that fewer eggs are likely to be gobbled up by predators. And these octopuses seem to know that, Barry says. “We believe they’re exploiting that thermal energy to improve reproductive success.”</p>



<p>Only a few other marine animals, such as <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/ice-fish-nest-antarctica-breeding-colony-largest-group">icefish in Antarctica’s Weddell Sea</a> (<em>SN: 1/13/22</em>), are known to seek out warmer conditions when breeding. But there are probably other species that do the same, Drazen says. The challenge is finding them and their breeding grounds in the vast expanse of the deep ocean. “I imagine that as we keep looking, we will keep finding really interesting sites that are important to certain species,” he says.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/tarantula-bamboo-bambootula-thailand-biology">This newfound tarantula is the first known to make its home in bamboo</a></h4>

              
                <p>Meet “bambootula.” This newfound tarantula gets its nickname from the tall, stiff-shafted grass in which it makes a home in northern Thailand.</p>



<p><em>Taksinus bambus</em>, as the spider is officially known, “is the world’s first tarantula with a biology tied to bamboo,” says arachnologist Narin Chomphuphuang of Khon Kaen University in Thailand.</p>



<p>Bamboo stems, or culms, give the tarantula ready-made burrows and nests. But <a href="https://zookeys.pensoft.net/article/76876/"><em>T. bambus</em> lacks the tools to bore into culms</a>, so it relies on natural forces or animals such as borer beetles and rodents to create openings, Chomphuphuang and colleagues report January 4 in <em>ZooKeys</em>. Once inside, bambootula builds a silk “retreat tube” that keeps the spider secure and helps it move around easily.<br><br>Chomphuphuang was introduced to the tarantula by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7NsgZvnbBs">JoCho Sippawat</a>, a popular wildlife YouTuber who discovered it when cutting bamboo in the forest near his home. Chomphuphuang’s team confirmed the spider belonged to a new genus and species based on the size and shape of its reproductive organs. It’s the first time in 104 years that anyone has turned up a new genus of tarantula in Asia, the researchers say.</p>

<p>Habitat type also was key to confirming the spider’s novelty, Chomphuphuang says. Other Asian tree-dwelling tarantulas are found in habitats unlike where bambootula showed up — a bamboo forest about 1,000 meters above sea level.</p>



<p>Cornell University arachnologist Linda Rayor isn’t too surprised by the find. So far, some 49,000 species of spiders are known to science and <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/meet-tarantula-black">new ones are frequently discovered</a> (<em>SN: 2/4/16</em>). Researchers estimate that 1 in every 3 to 5 spider species alive has yet to be found and named. Anyone can find a new spider, she says, including “local people looking and exploring and watching things.”</p>



<p>But “few people realize how much wildlife in Thailand is still undocumented,” Chomphuphuang says. Forests now cover only about one-third of the country. It’s important for scientists to keep looking for new species in such areas, he says, so the animals can be studied — and, where needed, protected.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2022/03/07/here-are-the-personality-traits-shared-by-famous-psychopaths/">Here are the personality traits shared by famous psychopaths</a></h4>

              
                <p><em>By</em> <a href="https://emmayoung.net/">Emma Young</a></p>



<p>What <em>is </em>psychopathy? For a concept that gets endless attention, there’s surprisingly little agreement. Various models have been put forward over the years. Robert Hare’s <a href="https://www.pearsonclinical.co.uk/store/ukassessments/en/hare/Hare-Psychopathy-Checklist-Revised-%7C-Second-Edition/p/P100009043.html">Psychopathy Checklist &#8211; Revised</a> has been particularly influential. But it, too, has been questioned, with debate centring on the nature of the fundamental traits that together make someone a psychopath.</p>



<p>In a bid for clarity, Cristina Crego at Longwood University and Thomas A. Widiger at the University of Kentucky decided to look for shared traits in six people, real and fictional, who have been identified as psychopathic. They present their work in a <a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2022-28155-001">new paper</a> in <em>Personality Disorders: Theory, Research and Treatment</em>. Their list includes a few names that might be come as a surprise. But this turned out to be an advantage — the pair feel that it drew them closer to understanding which are the core traits of psychopathy, and which are red herrings.</p>



<span id="more-45627"></span>



<p>This is the list:</p>



<p>Theodore (Ted) Bundy: a serial killer who admitted to at least 30 murders in the 1970s. Hare reports that Bundy described himself as “the most cold-hearted son of a bitch you’ll ever meet”.</p>



<p>Clyde Barrow: a man who murdered a long list of people, including members of the public and prison guards; also said to be charming and engaging.</p>



<p>Bernie Madoff: a “snake in a suit”, he was responsible for what’s regarded as the largest Ponzi scheme and financial fraud in US history.</p>



<p>Chuck Yeager: a highly successful US test pilot; he had what Tom Wolfe famously called “the right stuff” — in particular, fearlessness. Various researchers have suggested that Yeager might have been psychopathic.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Plus:</p>



<p>James Bond: there are claims that he, too, is a (fictional) psychopath</p>



<p>Sherlock Holmes: fearless, ruthless in his pursuit of his goals… psychopathic? Some researchers think so, the authors note.</p>



<p>Yeager, Bond and Holmes are also all seen as heroes. But, as Crego and Widiger add, it has been claimed that “the hero and psychopath are twigs from the same branch”.</p>



<p>The pair’s approach was pretty straightforward. Rather than taking traits that have been associated with psychopathy and checking to see if they matched the personalities of purported psychopaths, they took the reverse approach. They prepared 3- to 5-page-long case histories for each of the six individuals. Online participants read these, then used three different rating forms to score them on a very comprehensive range of traits — then the researchers looked for any patterns in the results. The participants were not told that the purpose of the study was to investigate psychopathy (though no doubt many guessed this).</p>



<p>The first form consisted of 39 traits from Hare’s psychopathy checklist, and also traits from other psychopathy measures, such as Paulhus’s Self-Report Psychopathy-III. These traits included &#8220;lack of remorse&#8221;, &#8220;cruel&#8221; and &#8220;arrogant&#8221;, for example. Definitions were provided for each one.</p>



<p>The second form consisted of 12 traits identified by psychopathy pioneer Hervey Cleckley, but not included in the first form. These included &#8220;good intelligence&#8221; and an absence of delusions (again, definitions were given).</p>



<p>The third form contained 30 items from the Five Factor model of personality. This was included because some researchers argue that psychopathy can be understood as a mixture of scores at the extreme end of normal on measures of extraversion, neuroticism, openness, conscientiousness and agreeableness.</p>



<p>The results led Crego and Widiger to identify eight traits as cropping up time and again. These were: low vulnerability, low self-consciousness, low anxiousness, fearlessness, boldness, assertiveness, dominance and excitement-seeking. However, the traits that really stood out and that overlapped in the cases of Bundy, Barrow and Madoff — the most undisputed psychopaths — were ones that related to antagonism. These included callousness, manipulativeness, dishonest, arrogance and cruelty.</p>



<p>In fact, Yeager, Bond and Holmes didn’t show these antagonistic traits, and didn’t meet traditional criteria for psychopathy. Instead, the authors suggest they may have been mistakenly identified as psychopathic in the past simply because of their fearlessness and boldness. And while these traits are found in psychopaths, they are not exclusive to them. “From this perspective, the hero and psychopath may not represent twigs from the same branch but entirely independent branches,” the pair writes.</p>



<p>Interestingly, low conscientiousness has been identified by other researchers as a key psychopathic trait. But Madoff scored highly in many aspects of conscientiousness, including striving for achievement and being competent. So either Madoff isn’t a psychopath — or low conscientiousness is not a key psychopathic trait.</p>



<p>There are various limitations to the work. One is that the &#8220;psychopath&#8221; is a hugely popular concept, featuring often in the media and in fiction. It’s certainly possible that the participants not only guessed the purpose of the study, but that their ideas about psychopathy coloured their ratings. Also, of the six individuals, only three would be widely seen as &#8220;obvious&#8221; psychopaths — and two were of course fictional. Their relevance to understanding actual psychopaths is debatable. It’s also hard to see how this particular work will change the mind of anyone who thinks that Holmes and Bond, say, <em>are</em> psychopaths.</p>



<p>Still, the results will feed into the ongoing argument about which traits are core to psychopathy. According to this work: traits relating to antagonism, yes; fearlessness, boldness, and level of conscientiousness, no. </p>

<p>I am a medical sociologist working in the fields of maternity care, public health, and global health. For the past 13 years I have been Professor of Reproductive Health Research at Bournemouth University, in the south of England. Before that I spent 17 years at the University of Aberdeen in Scotland as Senior Lecturer, and subsequently, Reader in Public Health. My work is based in the UK and in low-income countries, especially in South Asia. All my work, or nearly all my work, is interdisciplinary in nature. Often, I bring a sociological or social science perspective to a team focusing on health, health promotion, or health services research. Because of my involvement in many different research teams my work relates to quite a few UN SDGs. However, the main SDGs for me are probably 3, 5, and 17. SDG 3 ‘Good Health and Well-being’ is at the core of my work as sociologist of health and illness, closely followed by SDG 5 ‘Achieve gender equality and empower all women and girls’ which is key in all health fields, and especially in my post as Professor of Reproductive Health Research studying maternity and midwifery.</p>
<p>The first project I would like to highlight focusing on SDG 3 is an interdisciplinary project, studying the effects of Nepal becoming federal republic in 2015 on its health system. This ‘<a href="https://www.nepalfederalhealthsystem.com/?utm_source=bmc_blogs&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=null&amp;utm_campaign=blog_2020_bmcseriesblog">Nepal Federal Health System Project</a>’ is UK-funded by the MRC (Medical Research Council), the Wellcome Trust and DFID (Department for International Development) under the Health Systems Research Initiative grant. This exciting project is collaboration between researchers at four UK universities, including Bournemouth University, and two organizations in Kathmandu, Nepal: Manmohan Memorial Institute of Health Science and PHASE Nepal.</p>
<blockquote><p>Strengthening midwifery education to international standards is a key step to improving quality of care and reducing maternal and newborn mortality and morbidity.</p></blockquote>
<p>The central focus of the project is on health policies, clearly linking it to SDG 3 ‘Good Health and Well-Being’, but health is of course connected to almost all other goals and therefore demands a multi-sectoral systems approach. In Nepal, social and health inequities, environmental pollution, large-scale labor migration, disaster planning, the gap between rural and urban populations, and many more societal problems require health systems thinking. We know that general policies and non-health interventions can have health implications at levels of society, from the local community to the national level. This project had a slow start as it coincided with the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, which seriously restricted both international travel between the UK and Nepal and local travel in Nepal.</p>
<p>I would particularly like to highlight my contribution to SDG 17 ‘Strengthen the means of implementation and revitalize the global partnership for sustainable development’ in this blog. This is perhaps a less obvious choice. Many of our projects run in collaboration with partners in low-income countries, including strengthening partnerships and building capacity in-country as a key element. The Nepal Federal Health System Project incorporated elements of staff and organizational development for our partners in Nepal. These training sessions to date have included sessions on, for example, systematic reviewing and writing and publishing in English-language journals.<img class="size-medium wp-image-12783 aligncenter" src="https://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2022/03/EvT-flier-300x224.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="224" srcset="https://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2022/03/EvT-flier-300x224.jpg 300w, https://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2022/03/EvT-flier-768x575.jpg 768w, https://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2022/03/EvT-flier-640x479.jpg 640w, https://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2022/03/EvT-flier.jpg 1013w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></p>
<p>The second project in this blog highlights the importance of midwives in ensuring safe, woman-centered maternity care. Nepal, like many low-income countries, still does not have enough appropriately skilled midwives. Strengthening midwifery education to international standards is a key step to improving quality of care and reducing maternal and newborn mortality and morbidity.</p>
<p>Our Bournemouth University team, supported by midwifery colleagues at <a href="https://www.du.se/en?utm_source=bmc_blogs&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=null&amp;utm_campaign=blog_2020_bmcseriesblog">Dalarna University</a> from Sweden, helped develop midwifery education in Nepal in a project funded by GIZ (Gesellschaft für Internationale Zusammenarbeit), the German equivalent of DFID 2019-2021. In Nepal there is a shortage of appropriately trained and educated midwives to teach newly established undergraduate midwifery courses. Our project involves developing a framework for providing academic support to nurse/midwife educators with the aim to enhance their midwifery knowledge and skills. It also involves designing, in collaboration with key stakeholders in Nepal, a bridging program to upskill current maternity workers so they can apply for their midwifery license to practice. This project clearly links to SDG 3, 4 and 17. We faced the same problems as in the project above, that the COVID-19 pandemic started shortly after the start of the project. This seriously hindered our ability to travel to Nepal and deliver clinical training. Some training we managed to do by Zoom but midwifery training needs hands-on, face-to-face delivery.</p>
<p>COVID-19, the disease as well as associated restrictions and lockdowns, will have affected the progress towards achieving the SDGs. My worry is that some will use the pandemic as an excuse for not achieving as much as planned. As researchers we must consider the benefits as well as the limitations of working remotely. We have realized that many research meetings, training exercises and conferences can be conducted online without people have to travel across the globe, thus reducing our carbon footprint as academics. I believe that what we have learnt during the pandemic should continue to be part of our working practice.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/e-coli-viral-grenade-bacteria-dna-toxin-colibactin">Some E. coli set off viral grenades inside nearby bacteria</a></h4>

              
                <p>Some bacteria can trigger unexploded viral grenades in neighboring bacteria’s DNA.</p>



<p>Certain <em>Escherichia coli</em> bacteria, including some that live in human intestines, make a chemical called colibactin. That <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-022-04444-3">chemical awakens dormant viruses inside nearby bacteria</a>, sometimes leading to their destruction, researchers report February 23 in <em>Nature</em>.</p>



<p>This type of biological warfare among bacteria hasn’t been described before. “It’s an interesting strategy, and it’s also a dangerous strategy,” says Heather Hendrickson, an evolutionary microbiologist at the University of Canterbury in Christchurch, New Zealand, who was not involved in the work.</p>





<p>Colibactin producers must creep up on their bacterial enemies and trigger the unexploded ordinance hiding in the enemies’ DNA. Those grenades are prophages — bacteria-infecting viruses that have inserted themselves into their hosts’ DNA, where they hide out harmless and dormant until something triggers their awakening. That something, in this case, is DNA damage caused by colibactin.</p>



<p>When colibactin dings DNA, a bacterial repair system called the SOS response kicks in, chemical biologist Emily Balskus and colleagues found. “What many phages have done is to tap into that response,” says Balskus, a Howard Hughes Medical Institute investigator at Harvard University.</p>



<p>“It’s a signal for them to move out of this dormant lifestyle and awaken to kill their host and move on to find a new host,” she says. Once phages wake up, they replicate and burst out of the host cell, destroying it.</p>



<p>But once these viral grenades go off, they can infect other bacteria, potentially exposing the attacking bacteria and other close-by microbes to biological shrapnel.</p>



<p>Humans might also get caught in the cross fire. Researchers already knew that colibactin can cause damage to human DNA that may lead to colon cancer. But why the bacteria would use the chemical against people wasn’t known.</p>



<p>The new research suggests that <em>E. coli</em> may not be producing colibactin to assault its human hosts, but <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/bacteria-virus-phage-shigellosis-arms-race">as a countermeasure</a> against other microbes, Hendrickson says (<em>SN: 12/14/21</em>). “It’s easy to forget that there’s this continual conversation and warfare going on between bacteria, and we might not be the focus of their activities.”</p>



<p>Among bacteria, colibactin isn’t usually a lethal weapon. In most bacteria that Balskus and her colleagues examined, colibactin caused DNA damage, but the bacteria were able to repair the wounds. That may be because colibactin is an unstable chemical that quickly degrades before it can break enough DNA to do irreparable harm, Balskus says. Some bacteria also make other chemicals that defuse colibactin before it can damage DNA, her team found. Only bacteria that have unexploded prophages in their DNA and no other defenses were vulnerable to colibactin-producing bacteria in laboratory dishes.</p>



<p>Because colibactin decays quickly, “it suggests this is a very short-range communication,” says Michael Dougherty, a microbiome researcher at the University of Florida in Gainesville who was not involved in the study. “Maybe it could have an effect when bacteria are forming biofilms where you have trillions of bacteria stacked on top of each other.”</p>



<p>Colibactin may not be the only factor involved in exploding neighboring bacteria, says Dougherty’s University of Florida colleague Christian Jobin. Balskus’ team did not demonstrate that colibactin alone could detonate prophages. Perhaps something else about the colibactin-producing bacterium’s presence is required to kick off the fireworks, he suggests.</p>



<p>The researchers don’t yet know whether colibactin can trigger prophages when bacteria are in their natural habitats, such as human and other animal intestines. And perhaps awakening the viruses is an accident, Balskus speculates.</p>



<p>“Maybe [colibactin] didn’t really evolve to kill. Maybe its primary ecological function involves doing something else,” she says. What that might be is a mystery that Balskus and her colleagues are working to solve.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/universe-first-stars-cosmic-dawn-not-found">Astronomers may not have found a sign of the universe’s first stars after all</a></h4>

              
                <p>A new study casts a haze over a hint of the universe’s first glimmers of starlight.</p>



<p>In 2018, researchers claimed that a subtle signature in radio waves from early in the universe’s history had revealed the era when the first stars switched on, known as the cosmic dawn. But the first experiment to test that study’s conclusions <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41550-022-01610-5">found no sign of those early stars</a>, scientists report February 28 in <em>Nature Astronomy</em>.</p>



<p>Just after the Big Bang about 13.8 billion years ago, the universe was a hot stew of matter. Stars probably didn’t flicker on until at least 100 million years later — a poorly understood era of the cosmos. Finding signs of the first beams of starlight would flesh out the cosmic origin story. So the 2018 claim of pinpointing those earliest gleams, from the EDGES experiment in the Australian outback, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/universe-first-stars-born-big-bang">caused an astronomical hubbub</a> (<em>SN: 2/28/18</em>).</p>





<p>“It definitely completely excited our whole community with this fascinating result,” says radio astronomer Saurabh Singh of the Raman Research Institute in Bangalore, India.</p>



<p>The researchers reported detecting a dip across particular wavelengths of radio waves, a sign of light from the first stars interacting with surrounding hydrogen gas. But the result quickly raised skepticism, because the dip was deeper than expected. To know whether the hint of the first starlight was real, scientists would need to make more measurements.</p>



<p>Singh and colleagues did just that with the Shaped Antenna Measurement of the Background Radio Spectrum 3, or SARAS 3. Similar to EDGES, the experiment uses an antenna to pick up radio waves. But SARAS 3 has a different design from EDGES, with a differently shaped antenna. And SARAS 3 is designed to float atop a lake. “That gives us a very distinctive advantage,” Singh says.</p>



<p>On Earth, radio waves come from a variety of sources, which must be carefully accounted for to reveal the subtler signal from the cosmic dawn. Misunderstanding those other sources of radio waves could lead to an unaccounted-for experimental error that might give incorrect results.</p>



<p>In particular, experiments on land must contend with radio waves emitted from the ground, which are difficult to estimate due to the complex, layered nature of soil. When the antenna is atop a lake, it’s easier to estimate what kinds of radio waves come from the uniform water below. Data taken from two lakes in India revealed no sign of the dip.</p>



<p>The new study “highlights just how difficult this measurement is,” says physicist H. Cynthia Chiang of&nbsp;McGill University in Montreal. It’s uncomfortable that the two studies disagree, she says, but notes that the disagreement “isn&#8217;t quite enough to make any definitive conclusions at this point.”</p>



<p>And some of the same types of experimental issues that may affect EDGES could also affect SARAS 3, says experimental cosmologist Judd Bowman of Arizona State University in Tempe, a member of the EDGES team. “We still have more work ahead to reach the final outcome.”</p>



<p>An improved version of EDGES will be deployed later this year, and the SARAS 3 team has additional deployments planned. Other experiments are also working on similar measurements. Those tests may finally illuminate the universe’s transition from darkness to light.</p>

                <p><em>By </em><a href="http://emilyoliviareynolds.com/">Emily Reynolds</a></p>



<p>Searching for meaning is something many of us experience throughout our lives: finding something to strive for that gives shape, direction, and purpose to the things we choose to do. For some, this meaning is religious; some political; some interpersonal. And having a sense of meaning can bring us happiness (or, if we lack meaning, unhappiness).</p>



<p>A <a href="https://www.gsb.stanford.edu/sites/default/files/publication/pdfs/RP4003.pdf">new study</a> to be published in <em>Emotion</em> looks at the relationship between meaning and happiness in the context of financial resources. Rhia Catapano from the University of Toronto and colleagues find that meaning is a far weaker predictor of happiness for rich people than poorer people — suggesting economic resources can impact how we experience meaning.</p>



<span id="more-45610"></span>



<p>The team analysed data from over 500,000 people across 123 countries. The first study used data from a daily poll of US residents collected between 2013 and 2015. Wellbeing was tracked using measures of positive affect — whether, during the day before they were surveyed, participants had smiled or laughed a lot, experienced a lot of enjoyment, or experienced a lot of happiness.</p>



<p>Meaning was measured through a daily &#8220;purpose index&#8221;, which explored the extent to which participants felt that they like what they do every day and are motivated to achieve their goals. (Though this may be more accurately described as a measure of purpose than meaning, the team note that the terms are somewhat interchangeable in this part of the study). Finally, income levels were assessed.</p>



<p>The results showed that the correlation between meaning and happiness was strongest among those in lower income brackets. But as income levels increased, the correlation became weaker: in other words, having a sense of meaning or purpose was not as good a predictor of happiness among those with a higher income. &nbsp;</p>



<p>The second study looked at worldwide data. Happiness was measured using the same questions as in the first study, while meaning was measured using the single question: “Do you feel your life has an important purpose or meaning?”. Again, the strength of the relationship between meaning and happiness depended on participants’ income: meaning had a greater influence on happiness for those on lower incomes compared to those in higher brackets.</p>



<p>In the final study, French participants indicated the extent to which they felt they led a purposeful and meaningful life and how much they considered themselves a happy person. Finally, rather than using specific income brackets, they placed themselves on a &#8220;social ladder&#8221; representing where they stand in society with regard to wealth, education, and career. The results from this study replicated the first two.</p>



<p>So, overall, meaning and happiness had a stronger relationship in those with fewer resources than those with more. This might be the case because richer individuals have more access to other sources of happiness — many of which will be external, like lack of stress or community. Thus, a focus on an internal sense of satisfaction, purpose or meaning is less important. Future research could explore the relationship more fully, and look at how happiness impacts meaning as well as vice versa.</p>



<p>The team also notes the higher levels of depression and anxiety in people in lower income brackets and suggests that focusing on meaning may be one way of improving mental health. It’s crucial not to avoid the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/jun/24/austerity-and-inequality-fuelling-mental-illness-says-top-un-envoy">structural factors</a> involved here, however: designing interventions that focus on meaning are not going to alleviate systemic injustices many people on low incomes face.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/russia-ukraine-war-space-science-nasa">How Russia’s war in Ukraine hinders space research and exploration</a></h4>

              
                <p>Space exploration may seem like a faraway endeavor from Earth’s surface, but events on the ground ripple into space. The Russian war on Ukraine is no exception.</p>



<p>From a rocket launch system to a rover set to explore Mars, a wide range of space missions is facing postponements or cancelations due to escalating tensions on the ground in the wake of Russia’s full-scale invasion into Ukraine on February 24. The European Union, United States and others have imposed sanctions on Russia; Russia, as a result, is continually changing and canceling its space-related plans. The shifts are having an impact on everything from international collaborations to missions that rely on Russian rockets to get to space.</p>



<p>Here’s a closer look at some of those projects.</p>





<h4>ExoMars rover</h4>



<p>The ExoMars mission is a partnership between the European Space Agency and the Russian space agency Roscosmos. This is a two-part mission to Mars consisting of an orbiter and a rover. The orbiter has been <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/blog/science-ticker/exomars-mission-set-arrive-red-planet-october-19">at the Red Planet since late 2016</a>, but the Rosalind Franklin rover was supposed to launch this September (<em>SN: 10/18/16</em>).</p>



<p>“The sanctions and the wider context make a launch in 2022 very unlikely,” the European Space Agency, or ESA, said <a href="https://www.esa.int/Newsroom/Press_Releases/ESA_statement_regarding_cooperation_with_Russia_following_a_meeting_with_Member_States_on_28_February_2022">in a February 28 statement</a> in response to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.</p>



<p>Due to Earth’s and Mars’ orbital geometry, the most direct trajectory for a spacecraft from our planet to Mars repeats every two years, and that launch window remains open for less than two weeks. The ExoMars rover, which will look for signs of past life, was originally to launch in 2020, but due to the pandemic and technical issues, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/mars-rover-exomars-coronavirus-technical-issues-delay">it slipped to 2022</a> (<em>SN: 3/12/20</em>). Now it’s at risk of slipping again to 2024.</p>



<h4>The eROSITA telescope</h4>



<p>Spectrum-Roentgen-Gamma is a space-based X-ray observatory, run jointly by Germany and Russia, that has been mapping <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/xray-map-sky-erosita-telescope-milky-way">the large-scale structure of the universe</a> for the last two and a half years (<em>SN: 7/8/20).</em> The probe’s main telescope, eROSITA, has discovered hundreds of celestial objects, including <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/x-ray-glow-cow-supernova-explosion-black-hole-neutron-star">a bizarre stellar explosion known as a “cow”</a> (<em>SN: 1/21/22</em>). On February 26, the Germans <a href="https://twitter.com/eROSITA_SRG/status/1498699903480049670">placed eROSITA into safe mode</a> as an action to “freeze co-operation with Russia,” according to a statement from SRG leadership at the Max Planck Institute in Garching, Germany. &nbsp;</p>



<p>“This is a standard, reversible, operation mode of the telescope, in which we do not take data, but keep the vital subsystems on,” says Andrea Merloni, an astronomer at the Max Planck Institute for Extraterrestrial Physics, also in Garching, and eROSITA’s project scientist. He declined to comment on any other aspect of the mission or collaboration with Russia.</p>



<p>The Russian News Agency TASS reported March 1 that Roscosmos intends to estimate the financial loss of that safe-mode action and other European space-related sanctions, and the Russian space agency will then bill “the European side” of the projects.</p>



<p>ESA, meanwhile, is “assessing the consequences on each of our ongoing programmes conducted in cooperation with the Russian state space agency,” the agency said in its February 28 statement.</p>



<h4>Navigation satellites</h4>



<p>In response to international sanctions against Russia, the head of Roscosmos announced February 26 that the agency was <a href="https://mobile.twitter.com/Rogozin/status/1497456152442978305">suspending cooperation</a> with the European spaceport in Kourou, French Guiana, and withdrawing its dozens of employees from the site. Several space missions were set to launch from this location via a Russian Soyuz rocket in the next year, including a pair of European navigation satellites in early April.</p>



<p>These satellites would have joined with the already-launched two dozen that make up the Galileo navigational system, the European answer to the United States’ GPS system. Two additional Galileo satellites are also in orbit, but <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/satellite-oops-reaffirms-einstein-theory-gravity">they were placed incorrectly</a> and instead focus on science and search and rescue (<em>SN: 12/10/18</em>).</p>



<h4>OneWeb internet network</h4>



<p>The U.K. company OneWeb, which is building a space-based internet network with hundreds of low-Earth satellites, is also facing a launch postponement.</p>



<p>A Soyuz rocket was scheduled to send up a few dozen OneWeb satellites March 4, one of a series of launches aimed at completing the network in 2022. But in the early hours of March 2, the head of Roscosmos tweeted <a href="https://mobile.twitter.com/roscosmos/status/1498967071727706114">the space agency wouldn’t launch the satellites</a> without a guarantee from the company that they wouldn’t be used for military purposes. He also demanded the U.K. government sell its share of the mission, which it has refused to do.</p>



<h4>Venera-D mission to Venus</h4>



<p>The Russian-Ukraine war has also affected U.S. space activities, but to a lesser extent than its impact on its European counterparts. NASA has relationships with several commercial partners, so the agency relies less on Roscosmos. But NASA is still feeling some effects.</p>



<p>For instance, in retaliation to U.S. sanctions, the head of Roscosmos tweeted on February 26 that NASA’s participation in <a href="https://mobile.twitter.com/roscosmos/status/1497473032813690884">the Russian-led Venera-D mission to Venus would be “inappropriate.</a>” This mission will include an orbiter, lander and surface station, and it will focus on understanding Venus’s former and present habitability.</p>



<p>However, Venera-D won’t launch until late this decade, and NASA has been involved only in some planning groups. The U.S. space agency already has <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/nasa-venus-mission-davinci-veritas-space-planetary-science">two of its own Venus missions</a> in the works (<em>SN: 6/02/21</em>).</p>



<h4>International Space Station</h4>



<p>While many areas of cooperation in space with Russia are fraying, the International Space Station collaboration so far remains unchanged. “NASA continues working with all our international partners, including the State Space Corporation Roscosmos, for the ongoing safe operations of the International Space Station,” NASA public affairs officer Joshua Finch, at Kennedy Space Center in Cape Canaveral, said in an e-mailed statement.</p>



<p>Currently, there are two Russian cosmonauts, four NASA astronauts and one ESA astronaut aboard the station. Later this month, a Russian Soyuz capsule is set to return the two cosmonauts and one of the NASA astronauts to Earth, landing in Kazakhstan as scheduled, Finch said.</p>



<p>However, during a March 1 NASA Advisory Council meeting, Wayne Hale, a former NASA associate administrator, recommended the U.S. space agency consider contingencies in case Russia no longer collaborates on the space station. At the same meeting the following day, former U.S. representative Jane Harman recommended that NASA think about what cooperation with Russia will look like going forward.</p>



<div class="wp-block-sciencenews-content-sidebar">
<h4>Other science collaborations at risk</h4>



<p>Space research is not the only area of science experiencing uncertainty due to Russia’s war on Ukraine. Here are two other scientific collaborations showing signs of strain.</p>



<p><strong>Nuclear fusion:</strong> In Southern France, an international group of physicists is <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/nuclear-fusion-gets-boost-private-sector-startups">constructing ITER</a>, which will be the world’s largest plasma physics experiment to produce energy the same way stars do at their cores (<em>SN: 1/27/16</em>). Seven partner members — including the European Union, Russia and the United States — lead the project and develop the equipment used in the experiment. No one yet knows what the effects on ITER will be because this is a <a href="https://twitter.com/iterorg/status/1498944207024795650">“situation without precedent,”</a> the ITER organization said in a March 2 tweet. <em>— Liz Kruesi</em></p>



<p><strong>Arctic research:</strong>  Since the Arctic Council was established in 1996, its eight full members — including Russia and the United States — have forged agreements on issues from oil spill cleanup plans to scientific cooperation, leading to nominations for the Nobel Peace Prize, <a href="https://www.highnorthnews.com/en/arctic-council-nominated-nobel-peace-prize">including in 2022</a>. It’s not yet clear what impacts the war will have on this cooperation, or on other international Arctic efforts, such as U.S.-Russia joint patrols in the Bering Sea and an E.U.-Russia plan to retrieve sunken nuclear submarines from Russian waters. <em>— Carolyn Gramling</em></p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/dopamine-mice-rem-sleep-dream">A hit of dopamine sends mice into dreamland</a></h4>

              
                <p>A quick surge of dopamine shifts mice into a dreamy stage of sleep.</p>



<p>In the rodents’ brains, the chemical messenger <a href="http://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.abo1987">triggers rapid-eye-movement sleep</a>, or REM, researchers report in the March 4 <em>Science</em>.</p>



<p>During a night’s sleep, people and other animals cycle between phases called non-REM sleep and REM, a sleep stage that usually comes with vivid dreams. But what causes those transitions is mysterious, says neurologist and sleep researcher Thomas Scammell of Harvard Medical School who wasn’t involved in the study. These new results are some of the first to show a trigger for the shifts, Scammell says. Understanding these transitions in more detail could ultimately point to ways to treat sleep disorders in people. &nbsp;</p>





<p>Certain nerve cells residing in a part of the mouse brain called the ventral tegmental area can pump out dopamine, a molecule that has been linked to pleasure, movement and learning, among other things. These cells can deliver dopamine to the amygdalae, two almond-shaped structures deep in the brain that are closely tied to emotions.</p>



<p>Using a molecular sensor that can tell exactly when and where dopamine is released, neuroscientist Takeshi Sakurai from the University of Tsukuba in Japan and colleagues saw that dopamine levels rose in the amygdalae just before mice shifted from non-REM sleep to REM sleep.</p>



<p>Next, the researchers forced the mice into the REM phase by controlling those dopamine-producing nerve cells using lasers and genetic techniques — a method called optogenetics. Compelled with light, the nerve cells released dopamine in the amygdalae while mice were in non-REM sleep. The mice then shifted into REM sleep sooner than they typically did, after an average of about two minutes compared with about eight minutes for mice that weren’t prompted to release dopamine. Stimulating these cells every half hour increased the mice’s total amount of REM sleep.</p>



<p>Additional experiments suggest that these dopamine-making nerve cells may also be involved in aspects of narcolepsy. A <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/sleep-gone-awry">sudden loss of muscle tone</a>, called cataplexy, shares features with REM sleep and can accompany narcolepsy (<em>SN: 10/9/10</em>). Stimulating these dopamine-making nerve cells while mice were awake caused the mice to stop moving and fall directly into REM sleep.</p>



<p>The results help clarify a trigger for REM in mice; whether a similar thing happens in people isn’t known, Sakurai says. Earlier studies have found that nerve cells in people’s amygdalae are active during REM sleep, he says, hinting at a role for the brain structure.</p>



<p>Many questions remain. Drugs that change dopamine levels in people don’t seem to have big effects on REM sleep and cataplexy, Scammell says. But these drugs affect the whole brain, he points out, and it’s possible that they are just not selective enough. “My overall question about this is, ‘How can we translate this to humans?’” Scammell says.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2022/03/which-solutions-best-support-sharing-and-reuse-of-code/">Which solutions best support sharing and reuse of code?</a></h4>

              
                <p><strong>Author:</strong> Lauren Cadwallader, Open Research Manager, PLOS</p>



<p>PLOS has released a <a href="http://doi.org/10.31219/osf.io/tys8p">preprint</a> and <a href="https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.19122611">supporting data</a> on research conducted to understand the needs and habits of researchers in relation to code sharing and reuse as well as to gather feedback on prototype code notebooks and help determine strategies that publishers could use to increase code sharing.</p>



<p>Our <a href="https://osf.io/f73a6/">previous research</a> led us to implement a mandatory code sharing policy at <em>PLOS Computational Biology</em> in March 2021 to increase the amount of code shared alongside published articles. As well as exploring policy to support code sharing, we have also been <a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2021/02/exploring-code-notebooks-through-community-focused-collaboration/">collaborating with NeuroLibre</a>, an initiative of the <a href="https://conp.ca/">Canadian Open Neuroscience Platform</a>, to learn more about the potential role of technological solutions for enhancing code sharing. Neurolibre is one of a growing number of interactive or executable technologies for sharing and publishing research, some of which have become integrated with publishers&rsquo; workflows.</p>



<p>Early conversations with researchers about the NeuroLibre <a href="https://notebook-factory.github.io/BayesianRepetoireOverlap/01Introduction/intro.html">notebook prototypes</a> suggested we needed to better understand code sharing and reuse from the perspective of both readers and authors. In February 2021 we launched a survey to gather the views of researchers in computational biology and related disciplines. 188 respondents completed the survey.</p>



<p><strong>What did we learn about readers?</strong></p>



<p>Three-quarters of the respondents told us they look at code associated with a research paper at least occasionally, with 39% looking at code frequently or very frequently. Only 6% said they never looked at the associated code, demonstrating that openly available code is valuable to other researchers.</p>



<p>The most common reason (70%) respondents gave for looking at the code was to aid their understanding of the article. Just under half of respondents (48%) want to reuse the code in some way, for example directly reusing the code or reusing selected parts of the code.&nbsp;</p>



<p>A &lsquo;Link to code repository&rsquo; (for example Github or Bitbucket) was rated as the most useful method for accessing others&rsquo; code and had almost been universally encountered (98%). Aside from &lsquo;Available on request&rsquo;, respondents rated &lsquo;Link to a website&rsquo; and &lsquo;executable code capsule in the research article&rsquo; as the least useful methods of accessing code.</p>



<p><img loading="lazy" width="524" height="315" src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/SHPWrKMZkOiFfNRWcEl9dD8NqAOq90AKC2MTy1o3Z7Sm_VTfEV8HCDLNuNKGY-h8lmsMBnwpjy0V3FBkSLswKrHBWPJ4FDOqSTUqP9MQRJ6lZeqYP_VFzwRv_u0Xu-0TRDW-dV0M"></p>



<p><em>Mean usefulness of different methods of code sharing. A score of zero equates to &lsquo;not at all useful&rsquo; and 100 equals &lsquo;extremely useful&rsquo;. The mean values are given above the bars. Error bars show the 95% confidence interval.</em></p>



<p><strong>What did we learn about authors?</strong></p>



<p>Our survey explored how important certain tasks are to researchers when sharing code, and how satisfied they are with their ability to complete them. Overall, authors of articles with associated code are satisfied with their own ability to carry out many code sharing related tasks. Being able to ensure that &lsquo;Readers can easily run the code in the correct environment&rsquo;, and &lsquo;The data and code are in the same place&rsquo;, had the lowest satisfaction scores, implying there may be opportunities for better tools (solutions) to support researchers with these tasks.</p>



<p>The majority of respondents reported that they spend more than one day preparing code for sharing alongside a publication. Using new tools or platforms for preparing and sharing code alongside a publication can require additional costs &ndash; in terms of time and effort &ndash; but&nbsp; there was no consensus, from our results, on whether researchers&nbsp; might be willing to spend additional time on using a tool, e.g. a notebook, to improve the utility of the code they are sharing.</p>



<p><strong>Technological and cultural solutions</strong></p>



<p>The findings of our survey have shown us that whilst researchers recognise the benefits that using code sharing technology bring, such as sharing data and code in the correct environment and allowing readers to easily change parameters, there may be insufficient incentives for researchers to carry out these tasks routinely when publishing in a journal. Most researchers in our survey appear to be satisfied with the community norm of sharing code via a code repository. While technological solutions could help researchers in other ways, to support our goal of increasing sharing and reuse of code, <em>PLOS Computational Biology</em>&rsquo;s focus on the &ldquo;cultural solution&rdquo; of a mandatory policy seems to be the optimal approach.</p>

                <p><em>By</em> <a href="https://twitter.com/mattbwarren">Matthew Warren</a></p>



<p>We’re all prone to a bit of magical thinking now and then. Maybe you try not to step on cracks in case it brings bad luck, or avoid talking about a good situation in case you “jinx” it — even though in reality there’s no way your actions would have any effect on the world.</p>



<p>When it comes to decisions about finances and risk, though, you’d probably claim to be a much more rational thinker. However, a <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/01461672221077791">new study</a> in <em>Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin</em> finds that we’re even susceptible to magical thinking when taking out insurance. The team finds that insuring against the loss or damage of a valued possession has what they call a “talisman effect”, making us feel that the misfortune is actually less likely to occur in the first place.</p>



<span id="more-45598"></span>



<p>In the first study, Robert Schindler from Rutgers University and colleagues asked participants to think about an object they had bought for around $100 and that held sentimental value. They imagined taking a holiday for two weeks and renting out the object. Some participants were told they were guaranteed full compensation for loss or damage, while the other participants were given no additional information. Finally, all participants rated the likelihood that their possession would be lost or damaged.</p>



<p>Participants who read about the guarantee thought it less likely that their special object would be damaged (they also thought it was less likely to be lost, though this effect didn’t reach statistical significance). This doesn’t make logical sense, of course: coverage against damage doesn’t mean that the damage is any less likely to happen.</p>



<p>The researchers then looked more directly at the effect of taking out insurance. Participants in this study again thought about a treasured possession, and imagined that they were taking this with them as they moved house. Some participants also read that they had purchased full-coverage shipping insurance from a good company, while others received no extra information.</p>



<p>Those who read that they had taken out insurance again believed it less likely that their object would be damaged or lost compared to the other participants. These people also reported a lower level of anxiety about the potential loss or damage of their object, and this seemed to be partly driving their feelings that they were protected against misfortune.</p>



<p>Using a similar methodology, a third experiment showed that these feelings of anxiety were reduced by taking out insurance from a reputable company, but not from one that was poorly rated. And only participants in the first group showed the talisman effect, believing it less likely that their property would be lost or damaged.   </p>



<p>A final study found that participants in an insured group didn’t just have a reduction in anxiety — they also had fewer negative thoughts about a mishap occurring to their object. We know from other work that more frequent thoughts about an event make it seem more likely to occur, so this could be the mechanism behind the talisman effect. That is, the peace of mind offered by insurance makes us think less often about bad things occurring — and the less we think about them, the less likely we believe they are to actually happen.</p>



<p>The results are worth bearing in mind when considering whether to insure something. Are there good reasons for taking out cover, such as protection against a large financial loss? Or is it possible that you are being motivated by a false sense that insurance will make misfortune less likely to occur?</p>



<p>They also have implications for the insurance sector, the authors write. In particular, insurance companies should not be allowed to imply that their products can actually ward off negative events. The team points to the example of a real health insurance policy called “CancerGuard”: clearly, taking out insurance can’t protect us against getting cancer, but a name like this could play into the kind of magical thinking highlighted in the study.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/covid-coronavirus-cdc-mask-guidelines-metrics-risk">How to interpret the CDC’s new mask guidelines</a></h4>

              
                <p>One moment, Campbell County in Wyoming’s northeastern corner was an area of high levels of transmission of the coronavirus, a scenario in which the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends that everyone wear a mask indoors in public places. In the space of a breath, that county got the green light from the CDC that everyone could remove their masks.</p>



<p>Campbell County is not alone. By one measure, in the week of February 20 to February 26, 91 percent of U.S. counties had high or substantial levels of community transmission of the coronavirus, the CDC calculated. The agency recommended <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/double-mask-fit-reduce-coronavirus-exposure-covid-19-pandemic">wearing masks</a> under those conditions (<em>SN: 2/12/21</em>). Yet on February 25, just 37.3 percent of counties were considered high risk and in need of masks, the agency projected. How could communities be in the Schrödinger’s cat position of simultaneous mask-on high and mask-off low risk?</p>



<p>Transmission levels of the virus hadn’t changed, but <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/downloads/science/Scientific-Rationale-summary-COVID-19-Community-Levels.pdf">the way that the CDC calculates risk</a> did. Under previous guidelines, case counts were the most important measure. The CDC labeled counties that exceeded 50 new COVID-19 cases per 100,000 people in the past week or had 8 percent of tests coming back positive as places with<a href="https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/?CDC_AA_refVal=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cdc.gov%2Fcoronavirus%2F2019-ncov%2Fcases-updates%2Fcases-in-us.html#county-view?list_select_state=all_states&amp;list_select_county=all_counties&amp;data-type=Risk"> substantial or high transmission</a>. </p>





<div class="wp-block-sciencenews-content-sidebar">
<h4>Previous guidance</h4>



<p>The CDC’s old metrics relied on only case counts to determine COVID-19 transmission risk in a community. As a result, much of the country was in the high or substantial levels. Counties with 100 cases or more per 100,000 people or 10 percent or more of positive tests were considered at high transmission risk (red), with lower figures indicating substantial (orange), moderate (yellow) or low (blue).</p>

<p>With the new guidelines, the CDC shifted focus to levels of severe disease. Case counts are just one of three numbers used to calculate risk. The new metrics raise case thresholds for wearing masks and other precautions to 200 weekly cases per 100,000 people. Below that level of cases is now considered <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/science/community-levels.html">low risk</a>, as long as the number of hospital admissions and percent of hospital beds occupied by COVID-19 patients are also low.</p>



<p>Higher case levels or more hospitalizations — both new admissions and beds filled — mark moderate or high transmission areas, and that’s when recommended public health measures, such as masking and testing, start phasing in again. Individuals can check their county’s COVID-19 levels <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/your-health/covid-by-county.html">using an online tool</a> from the CDC.</p>



<p>The focus on hospitalization aims to provide a glimpse at whether local health care systems have the ability to weather a new COVID-19 surge, CDC director Rochelle Walensky said February 25 at a news briefing.</p>



<div class="wp-block-sciencenews-content-sidebar">
<h4>New metrics</h4>



<p>The CDC’s updated metrics for COVID-19 risk take both case levels and hospitalizations in a community into account. As a result, less of the country is now in the high level. Fewer cases and hospitalizations per 100,000 people in the last seven days mean low transmission (green) while higher numbers indicate medium (yellow) or high (orange) levels.</p>

<p>Now is a good time for such a move, Walensky said. “We’re in a stronger place today as a nation with more tools to protect ourselves in our communities from COVID 19,” she said. With more people across the country <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/covid-pandemic-endemic-variant-dimmer-switch">vaccinated or recovered from prior infections</a>, the risk for severe disease and hospitalization is lower overall for most people (<em>SN: 2/24/22</em>). New<a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/covid-pill-merck-molnupiravir-antiviral-fda"> COVID-19 treatments also keep people out of the hospital</a> or reduce the number of days they stay there (<em>SN: 12/21/21</em>).</p>



<p>CDC’s move brought both praise and criticism. On the positive side, the guidelines are based on the most important measurement: levels of severe disease. And masking isn’t the only prevention measure recommended under the guidance: <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/covid-coronavirus-omicron-variant-testing-treatment">testing, treatments</a>, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/covid-coronavirus-vaccines-review-pandemic-2021">vaccines </a>and <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coronavirus-covid-air-spread-indoor-clean-ventilation-filtration">ventilation</a> are also covered (<em>SN: 1/11/22</em>; <em>SN: 12/15/21</em>; <em>SN: 5/18/21</em>). All of which can be dialed up or down as needed to combat new surges, the agency said.</p>



<p>But there are drawbacks, too. “These guidelines might delay the response of states and communities to new surges until there’s already a high level of severe disease and death in a community, [which] might ultimately lead to higher levels of severe disease and death,” says Alyssa Bilinski, an infectious diseases modeler at the Brown School of Public Health in Providence, R.I. That delay comes because people tend to be sick with COVID-19 for a week or more before they go to the hospital.</p>



<h3>Imperfect science</h3>



<p>Choosing which number or numbers to base public health policy on isn’t easy and is always imperfect, says epidemiologist Jay Varma, director of Weill Cornell Medicine’s Center for Pandemic Prevention and Response in New York City.</p>



<p>One reason for CDC’s new reliance on hospitalization numbers may be that it’s now harder than before to tell exactly how many people have COVID-19, just based on case counts, he says. Except in the earliest stages of the pandemic, public health officials always knew they were missing some COVID-19 cases, but people’s motivation to get tested was high, testing was readily available, and results of tests were almost always reported. “All three of those things have changed, making it necessary to change your strategy,” Varma says.</p>



<p>Now, even though tests are still widely available, the motivation to test has declined, and more people are testing at home. Those at-home test results aren’t usually reported, leaving public health officials in the dark about how much illness is in the community. Hospitalization numbers and hospital capacity are more accurate measures than case rates and may give public health officials a more solid idea of what’s happening.</p>



<p>“With the tools we have available, I think CDC chose the best options available,” Varma says.</p>



<p>Still, the higher case threshold of 200 cases per 100,000 population that would trigger mask recommendations seems tied to the <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/covid-coronavirus-omicron-variant-mutation-infectious">highly transmissible, but relatively mild omicron varian</a><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/covid-coronavirus-omicron-variant-mutation-infectious">t</a> (<em>SN: 3/1/22</em>).</p>



<p>“Omicron is the most infectious respiratory virus I have ever seen. I’ve never seen a virus spread through a population this fast,” Varma says. But high levels of immunity and a perhaps milder virus means that omicron didn’t cause as many hospitalizations as previous versions of the virus did. That new case threshold may need to be revised downward if another variant that is as contagious as omicron, but nastier, comes along, he says.</p>

<p>New surveillance strategies, built on existing systems, could help researchers keep an eye out for such variants, he says. Throughout the United States, communities take random surveys of doctors&#8217; offices and emergency rooms to see how much influenza-like illness is in the community. The same could be done for COVID-19, he says. In addition, people with respiratory illnesses should be tested for COVID-19, flu and other respiratory viruses at the same time.</p>



<p>One metric Varma says he would not add to CDC’s calculations is vaccination rates, though some people have suggested that. To some extent, vaccination rates are baked into the numbers already because vaccines <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/covid-coronavirus-vaccines-hospital-cases-rates-unvaccinated">prevent hospitalization and death</a>, which would be reflected in the new admissions and hospital capacity numbers (<em>SN: 8/31/21</em>). But vaccination rates aren’t as helpful in determining whether people should put on masks to avoid respiratory illnesses.</p>



<p>“Masks are important because they prevent any type of infection. Whereas, vaccinated people can still acquire infection and transmit it to each other,” Varma says. Folding vaccination rates into the equation “might lead you to erroneously think that even though the case numbers are very high, a highly vaccinated population might not need masks as much as a less vaccinated population.”</p>



<h3>Shifting responsibility</h3>



<p>With many politicians and members of the public eager to see an end to pandemic restrictions, CDC’s new guidelines are also a nod to the current political and social climate.</p>



<p>“Right now there’s a movement toward shifting the burden of preventing severe outcomes from COVID-19 from the community onto individuals, particularly individuals who are at higher risk,” Bilinski says. “It has been frustrating how forgotten immunocompromised and other vulnerable people are in these discussions.” Children 5 years old and younger, not yet eligible for COVID-19 vaccines, fall into that group of vulnerable people too.</p>



<p>If public health burdens are being shifted onto individuals’ shoulders, policies should make it easier for people to protect themselves with free N95 masks and testing for those people and their families, she says.</p>



<p>The new metrics are “a move in the right direction,” says Tina Tan, a pediatric infectious diseases physician at Northwestern University’s Feinberg School of Medicine and Ann &amp; Robert H. Lurie Children’s Hospital of Chicago. But, she says, masks and other public health measures remain important for kids who are too young to get vaccines and the people around them. Though, if there’s less disease circulating in the community overall, then kids will have a lower risk of exposure to the virus, she notes.</p>

</h4>
</aside>



<p>Still, Tan doesn’t think everyone will be dropping their masks so quickly. “To wear a mask in areas where you have low to medium transmission is a personal decision,” Tan says. “And there are still going to be a lot of people — myself included&nbsp; — who will continue to wear masks in those situations.”</p>



<p>The CDC’s new guidelines are not intended to discourage wearing masks, Walensky said during the news briefing. “Anybody is certainly welcome to wear a mask at any time,” she said. “We are absolutely endorsing if you feel more comfortable wearing a mask, feel free to do so.”</p>



<p>When making that personal decision, “You should be designing your precautions based on the most vulnerable people in your group,” Bilinski says, “the cancer patients in your life, or the people in assisted living.”</p>



<p>She expects to see less masking in the coming weeks and says that’s appropriate if cases and hospitalizations continue their downward trajectory. “But I still hope people are very ready to put masks back on and think about other precautions when there’s signs of a new surge.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/fecal-transplant-pills-peanut-allergy-clinical-trial-poop-bacteria">Fecal transplant pills helped some peanut allergy sufferers in a small trial</a></h4>

              
                <p><strong>PHOENIX</strong> — Pills loaded with bacteria from other people’s poop might help adults who are highly allergic to peanuts safely eat the nuts in small amounts.</p>



<p>In a small clinical trial, a one-day treatment of the pills helped some people with the allergy consume one or more peanuts. The results, presented February 26 at the American Academy of Allergy, Asthma &amp; Immunology annual meeting in Phoenix, are a first step toward seeing whether the approach, called fecal microbiota transplant, could extend to people allergic to foods other than peanuts. In the United States alone, about 32 million people have food allergies.</p>



<p>The trial evolved out of past research suggesting that gut microbes help shape the immune system to protect against food allergies. In a 2019 study, Rima Rachid, an allergist-immunologist at Boston Children’s Hospital, and her colleagues found that certain bacteria were enriched in the stool of babies without food allergies compared with babies who had food allergies. When transferred into allergy-prone mice, these bacteria — the single species <em>Subdoligranulum variabile</em> and a set of <em>Clostridia</em> species — <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-019-0461-z">prevented allergic responses</a>. The treatment, a type of bacteriotherapy, activated a subset of immune cells called regulatory T cells, which protect the mice from having allergic reactions.</p>





<p>In people, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/blog/scicurious/fecal-transplants-regulation">fecal transplants</a> — which take feces from healthy people and transplant it into ill individuals, usually by colonoscopy — have become a standard treatment for <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/bacteria-clostridioides-difficile-antibiotics-chain-mail-armor-shield">recurrent <em>Clostridium</em><em> difficile </em>infections</a> (<em>SN: 5/18/18</em>; <em>SN: 2/25/22</em>). But it wasn’t until research showed that fecal material could achieve comparable success when delivered as oral capsules that Rachid’s team started thinking about doing a trial in people with peanut allergies.</p>



<p>The team partnered with OpenBiome, a nonprofit stool bank, to collect stool samples from healthy donors without allergic diseases and encapsulate the fecal matter into odorless, tasteless pills. The donors had avoided peanuts and tree nuts for a week, and their stool was analyzed by liquid chromatography and mass spectrometry to ensure it contained no traces of nut proteins, Rachid said.</p>



<p>The study enrolled 15 adults with severe peanut allergies. At the start of the trial, each had an allergic reaction to 100 milligrams of peanut protein (less than half a peanut). The first 10 participants took 36 “poop pills” over a three-hour period. After one month, 30 percent (3 of 10 participants) could safely consume a 100-milligram dose of peanuts, and by four months, two of these individuals had increased their tolerance to at least 300 milligrams (about one peanut), enough to guard against most accidental exposures.</p>

<p>The remaining five participants had the same poop pill regimen, except that beforehand they took a four-day course of antibiotics with the aim of killing some of the bacteria naturally found in the body in order to clear space in the gut for the transferred microbes.&nbsp;</p>



<p>That strategy seemed to work better. Sixty percent (3 of 5 participants) raised their peanut threshold beyond 300 milligrams by month four. (The COVID-19 pandemic lockdown prevented data collection from several participants at the one-month timepoint.)</p>



<p>Throughout the study, no one suffered serious adverse events or had allergic reactions related to the fecal transplant, Rachid reported.</p>



<p>And in an analysis of participants’ blood samples, the researchers found increased levels of regulatory T cells only in the six people whose peanut threshold rose with bacteriotherapy — confirming what was previously observed in mice.</p>



<p>The results are exciting, says immunologist Cecilia Berin, deputy director of the Jaffe Food Allergy Institute at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai in New York City. The fact that fecal transplant pills helped a subset of individuals without needing exposure to a specific allergen suggests the approach could potentially be useful for patients with multiple food allergies, she says.</p>



<p>Rachid says her team plans to launch a larger trial this summer with a version of the stool-based treatment called microbial transfer therapy, or MTT. These capsules will contain higher concentrations of bacteria and less fecal material and can be taken at home, rather than in the clinical setting used for the study. A future trial will test a product that ditches the poop altogether and uses just the protective bacterial strains.</p>

<ul class="simple">
<li>Malin will speak to Fleur about topics/syllabus for the&nbsp;tutorial.</li>
<li>An idea is to keep tutorials tool agnostic, and then feed into different simulator specific tutorials.<ul>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/marie-maynard-daly-biochemistry-chemistry-history">Marie Maynard Daly was a trailblazing biochemist, but her full story may be lost</a></h4>

              
                <p>Marie Maynard Daly is known as the first African American woman to receive a Ph.D. in chemistry, earned in 1947 from Columbia University. It’s a superlative often repeated in the brief profiles of Daly that appear in anthologies of notable Black and female scientists — and an impressive achievement on its own.</p>



<p>But when I set out to discover more about Daly’s work and life, to <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/century/connection/unsung-characters">bring her story to a wider audience</a>, I found out I was two decades too late. &nbsp;</p>

<p>Daly published from 1949 to 1985, retired in 1986 and died in 2003 at the age of 82. Her husband predeceased her; she had no children. Most of Daly’s collaborators and colleagues have died in the last decade; her mentees are retired and unreachable; her former employers and professional organizations have minimal or no documents chronicling her life or research.</p>



<p>What we know about Daly comes primarily from her record of scientific publications. While working with biochemists Alfred Mirsky and Vincent Allfrey at Rockefeller Institute in New York City in the early 1950s, Daly found <a href="https://rupress.org/jgp/article/37/2/157/30262/SYNTHESIS-OF-PROTEIN-IN-THE-PANCREAS-II-THE-ROLE">direct experimental evidence</a> that protein synthesis requires RNA. James Watson cited that work in the lecture he gave after receiving the Nobel Prize for the discovery of the double-helix structure of DNA. Daly also identified <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2147486/">a new type of histones</a> and determined the distribution of different <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2147206/">nitrogenous bases</a> within nucleic acids (what we now call DNA and RNA). With Quentin Deming at Columbia University, she identified <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC289439/?page=1">cholesterol as an underlying cause of heart attacks</a>.</p>



<p>After she moved to Albert Einstein College of Medicine in New York City, Daly extensively studied hypertension and later analyzed how muscle cells <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/0003986180901824?via%3Dihub">use</a> <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/3970526/">creatine</a> to produce energy. She participated in a study that identified <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/262108/">lesions</a> in the lungs of a dog model of chronic cigarette smoking.</p>



<p>Daly’s studies were rigorous, her results important and her topics varied.</p>



<p>Various anthologies from the 1990s and online articles from the 2000s include some details about her personal life, but they largely reiterate the same handful of facts: Daly was born in Queens, N.Y., in 1921; she read microbiologist Paul de Kruif’s classic 1926 book <em>Microbe Hunters</em> as a child; she sought a doctorate in chemistry because she didn’t think she’d have luck getting a job during World War II. In addition to her research and teaching, Daly organized training programs to prepare minority undergraduates for medical school and graduate science programs.</p>



<p>In a letter from 1970, Abraham White of Albert Einstein College of Medicine, where Daly remained until her retirement in 1986, recommends Daly for promotion, citing her “high qualities of leadership,” valuable scientific contributions and administration of the Martin Luther King, Jr.–Robert F. Kennedy Program for Special Studies to recruit and prepare minority students for medical school. It’s one of only two primary documents the college had.</p>



<p>I couldn’t find anyone to speak about Daly — nor could I find any existing interviews. Sibrina Collins, a chemist, writer and executive director of the Marburger STEM Center at Lawrence Technological University in Southfield, Mich., encountered similar frustrations when she <a href="https://undark.org/2017/08/07/unsung-marie-maynard-daly-women-stem/">wrote</a> about Daly in 2017. Collins found few existing details on Daly’s life aside from the oft-repeated headline about her Ph.D. in chemistry. “It’s wonderful to say that somebody is the first to do something — that’s a nice historical fact — but it’s really important to highlight what they actually did, not just that they were the first,” Collins says.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-pullquote alignright"><blockquote><p>It’s wonderful to say that somebody is the first to do something &#8230; but it’s really important to highlight what they actually did, not just that they were the first.</p><cite>Sibrina Collins</cite></blockquote></figure>



<p>A <a href="https://www.encyclopedia.com/education/news-wires-white-papers-and-books/daly-marie-maynard-1921">profile</a> by Janet P. Stamatel, originally written in 2002 for a book series called <em>Contemporary Black Biography, </em>includes actual quotes from Daly<em>. </em>Stamatel, now a sociologist at the University of Kentucky in Lexington, says she believes she interviewed Daly for that story, but any notes or recording from the interview are long lost.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>



<p>And so Daly’s voice might also be lost. While we can read her papers and recite a few basic facts, there&#8217;s a whole wealth of her life missing. We know nothing of her motivations, convictions, failures and hopes for the future. We can imagine the great challenges she confronted as a woman and a Black scientist in the mid-1900s, but we don’t know how she approached and overcame them. Nor do we know the specifics that drove her to ask certain scientific questions. For instance, why did Daly work on a single study about smoking and lung cancer, a topic seemingly far-flung from her other work? Was she inspired by a loved one with cancer?</p>



<p>The whole research effort left me thinking about the stories society tells about science — whose stories are told, how and by whom. We need to prioritize documenting the stories of scientists, especially of scientists from historically marginalized groups, when and where they do their work. The media, historians, libraries, non-profit organizations, scientists, society as a whole — we can all do better to present opportunities for underrepresented scientists to share their voices and perspectives. Otherwise, we risk losing them altogether.</p>



<p>David Caruso, director of the <a href="https://www.sciencehistory.org/center-for-oral-history">Center for Oral History at the Science History Institute</a> in Philadelphia, and colleagues have been working to collect those stories, and it takes a concerted effort, he says. Of 722 interviews within the center&#8217;s collections, for example, 96 participants identify as female and 20 identify as African American, Caruso says. Following a multiyear effort to correct the bias in its collections, the organization now makes sure its current efforts are representative of diversity in the scientific and engineering communities, he adds. “Our collection still needs work, but it is improved significantly from what it once was.”</p>



<p>I still think about Daly from time to time, and the questions I would have asked given the chance to interview her. She was a real, feeling scientist driven by passions and shaped by a particular time and place. Her achievement in chemistry is inspiring, but her deeper story is lost to students and scientists who might have learned from her experiences.</p>

<p><a href="https://bookshop.org/a/21798/9781623176051">Fresh Banana Leaves</a><br><em>Jessica Hernandez<br>North Atlantic Books, $17.95</em></p>



<p>During the civil war in El Salvador that began in the 1970s, an injured Victor Hernandez hid from falling bombs beneath the fronds of a banana tree. The child soldier, a member of the Maya Ch’orti’ group indigenous to the region, made a crutch from a branch of the tree and limped toward Guatemala, toward freedom. “I strongly believe that it was this banana tree that saved my life,” he told his daughter, Jessica Hernandez, who shares the story in <em>Fresh Banana Leaves: Healing Indigenous Landscapes Through Indigenous Science</em>. “It is ironic because banana trees are not native to El Salvador,” he said.</p>





<p>Jessica Hernandez, an environmental scientist, draws parallels between her father’s story and that of the banana tree. The banana tree’s journey from Southeast Asia via colonial European ships forced the resilient plant to adapt to its new home in the Americas. Similarly, her father adjusted to being displaced, eventually settling in the United States, often experiencing less-than-warm welcomes along the way.</p>



<p>Hernandez uses her father’s stories and other first-person accounts to frame a complex discussion on the interplay between colonialism, the displacement of Indigenous peoples, land degradation, and differences between how Western researchers and Indigenous people approach conservation. Western restoration can often focus on rooting out invasive species, Hernandez points out. But such a narrow focus, she contends, fails to understand that Indigenous people — the lands’ original stewards — are integral parts of imperiled landscapes.</p>





<p>Some researchers are now taking a community-based approach to conservation, in which Indigenous people participate in project planning instead of serving as study subjects. But this still doesn’t go far enough, Hernandez argues: In such studies, non-Indigenous people often end up speaking for Indigenous communities.</p>



<p><em>Science News</em> spoke with Hernandez about what she sees as conservation&#8217;s failures, Indigenous displacement and the connection between the two. The following conversation has been edited for length and clarity.</p>



<p><strong><em>SN</em></strong><strong>: How do you use the term “</strong><strong>Indigenous</strong><strong>”?&nbsp; </strong><strong></strong></p>



<p><strong>Hernandez: </strong>Somebody who still has their ancestral practices, their cultural traditions, their kinships with their people, whether they’re displaced or not, and are native to that region, or to that place that they can call home.<br></p>



<p><strong><em>SN</em>: You write about how ecocolonialism — when non-Indigenous “settlers” govern Indigenous lands without consulting Indigenous people — can exacerbate climate change and result in Indigenous displacement and ecological grief. What is ecological grief?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Hernandez: </strong>When I talk about ecological grief, I’m talking about the longing that many [displaced] Indigenous peoples have to return to their lands. Another way to look at that is the relationships that we [Indigenous people] have with nature — especially with our plants, animals and nonliving relatives. When the impacts of climate change destroy them, there’s a mourning that we all undergo as Indigenous peoples.</p>



<p>A lot of settlers have lost their relationships with nature. They view nature as commodities without understanding that some of these natural resources mean something else to many people, aside from economic value.</p>



<p><strong><em>SN</em>: You also write about how many non-Indigenous scientists practice helicopter research. How does this affect Indigenous communities? </strong></p>



<p><strong>Hernandez: </strong>Helicopter research is when scientists come up with a question, but instead of building relationships with a community [whom the] question relates to, [they] just go to the community, collect the data and never come back.</p>



<p>Oftentimes, we see how even some [Indigenous] knowledge is stolen. The example I brought up in the book is how a white man went to the Aboriginal community [in Australia], learned about “permaculture” [a type of self-sustaining farming system that requires minimal input from people, unlike labor-intensive, single-crop agriculture] and came back and was deemed a “founder.” Permaculture is something that you can get certified in, but not necessarily understand that it is Indigenous knowledge. Those funds [from certification courses] are not going to the Indigenous communities whose knowledge system was co-opted.</p>

<p><strong><em>SN</em></strong><strong>: Are Western conservation efforts that are rooted in good intentions insufficient? </strong><strong></strong></p>



<p><strong>Hernandez: </strong>I get a lot of pushback, especially when we are communities of color speaking up against conservation. We have to look at the impacts, and I think that a lot of the impacts tend to be negative — tend to be oppressive — toward communities of color. [Conservationists] tend to make all these protected areas in other countries, when in reality, they’re jeopardizing that local community’s livelihood. We see that with marine protected areas, where people who rely on fishing for sustenance are not allowed to fish. It also sometimes displaces many people because they have to leave their ancestral lands to find better economic opportunities.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Conservation is very linear, focused on one species, and doesn’t necessarily look at the entire landscape. Look at the contributors of why a certain species is declining, and sometimes it’s not even that people are overharvesting — it’s climate change and other environmental impacts we tend to ignore.</p>



<p><strong><em>SN</em></strong><strong>: How can conservationists center Indigenous people in their approaches? </strong><strong></strong></p>



<p><strong>Hernandez: </strong>Invite them to the table or let them lead their own table. Indigenous peoples know their lands, know their environments, know some of the changes resulting from climate change. When you’re connected to your environment, you know best how to approach it. Conservationists should include Indigenous peoples as stakeholders, as opposed to always focusing on governments as the stakeholders.</p>



<p><strong><em>SN</em></strong><strong>: Aside from the general public, who should read this book?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Hernandez</strong>: [Conservation] professionals. People take actions once they start reflecting on how something that they uphold — like the field of conservation — can cause harm.</p>

                <p><em>By</em> <a href="https://emmayoung.net/">Emma Young</a></p>



<p>The label &#8220;conspiracy theory&#8221; is often slapped on unsubstantiated ideas. But does labelling something a conspiracy theory actually discredit it? A <a href="https://bpspsychub.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/bjop.12548?af=R">new paper</a> in the  <em>British Journal of Psychology </em>suggests not<em>.</em> Karen M. Douglas at the University of Kent and colleagues<em> </em>find that people call an idea that they already consider unbelievable a &#8220;conspiracy theory&#8221; — rather than being influenced by that term to disbelieve it.</p>



<span id="more-45579"></span>



<p>In an initial online study on 170 US adults, the team explored whether labelling a statement an &#8220;idea&#8221; or a &#8220;conspiracy theory&#8221; made any difference to the participants’ attitudes towards it. The statements were taken from an existing conspiracy theory scale; they included &#8220;The power held by heads of state is second to that of small, unknown groups who really control world politics&#8221;, for example.</p>



<p>The results were clear: whichever label was used made no difference to how seriously the statement was taken, or to participants’ ideas about how controversial or believable it was.</p>



<p>These findings support and extend <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/pops.12285">earlier work</a> that suggested calling an idea a conspiracy theory doesn’t actually reduce endorsement of it. And this is important, because as the team writes: “This suggests that people&#8217;s belief that the label has the power to discredit these narratives may be misplaced.”</p>



<p>The team then ran a second study on 199 students. The participants read a list of statements and rated the extent to which they would call each a conspiracy theory, and also their own level of agreement with the statement. The results showed that the less participants believed the statements to be true, the more likely they were to call them &#8220;conspiracy theories&#8221;. This hardly seems surprising. But the team takes it as evidence that pre-existing disbelief leads to use of the term.</p>



<p>In further studies, participants were shown pairs of statements, one more plausible than the other. For example, a statement about the loss of Malaysia flight MH370 came in two forms: &#8220;Malaysia flight MH370 was hijacked by North Korea, a fact known but suppressed by the Malaysian government&#8221; and &#8220;Malaysia flight MH370 was consumed by a black hole, a fact known by suppressed by the Malaysian government&#8221;.  The researchers found that participants tended to rate the less plausible statement as more likely to be a conspiracy theory and were more likely to call people who believed these ideas &#8220;conspiracy theorists&#8221;.</p>



<p>“Taken together, the present results…suggest that the label ‘conspiracy theory’ is likely to be a consequence rather than a cause of (dis)belief in conspiracy narratives,” the team writes.</p>



<p>Why does the “conspiracy theory” label have little power to encourage people to be sceptical about an idea?</p>



<p>As the researchers suggest, one possibility is that we know from experience that the label tends to be used by sceptics, so we may decide that the person using that label is biased, and resist their influence. Other work has also found that some people are more likely to endorse conspiracy theories that they think are unpopular <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2017/09/01/believing-widely-doubted-conspiracy-theories-makes-some-people-feel-special/">because it satisfies their need to feel special</a>. For these people, it’s possible that if the label is applied, this could backfire, and make the idea more appealing.</p>



<p>Clearly, more work is needed on how to tackle belief in conspiracy theories. But this research certainly further builds the case that simply calling them conspiracy theories won’t help.</p>



<p>&#8211; <a href="https://bpspsychub.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/bjop.12548?af=R">Is the label ‘conspiracy theory’ a cause or a consequence of disbelief in alternative narratives?</a></p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/africa-fynbos-plants-roots-long-thin-nutrients">Africa’s fynbos plants hold their ground with the world’s thinnest roots</a></h4>

              
                <p>Some plant roots draw a line in the sand — literally.</p>



<p>In South Africa, you can move between cool, green forest and sunbaked shrubland in a single stride. These narrow borders between dramatically different ecosystems are maintained by intense competition between plants’ roots, new research suggests.</p>



<p>Fynbos — a type of species-rich shrubland found only on the far southern tip of Africa — has <a href="https://www.pnas.org/content/119/9/e2117514119">the thinnest roots by far</a> of any plant community in the world, researchers report in the March 1 <em>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences</em>. These nutrient-gobbling roots, plus some fire-encouraging adaptations, help turn the fynbos into an austere realm where only fynbos plants can survive.&nbsp;</p>





<p>Interested in what factors organize nature at very broad scales, ecologist Lars Hedin and his colleagues wanted to look at places where environmental changes over time can flip the ecosystem between two distinct states.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Enter the fynbos. It’s a low, shrubby habitat home to <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/smokey-gardener">mind-blowing plant diversity</a>: more than 7,000 species, most of which are found nowhere else in the world (<em>SN</em>: 8/24/2004).&nbsp;</p>



<p>“It&#8217;s one of the most floristically biodiverse systems in the world,” says Hedin, of Princeton University. “It’s essentially as diverse as a tropical forest.”</p>



<p>But right next to this hot, flower-filled wonderland — with the same climate and underlying geologic composition — is the lush Afro-temperate forest, flourishing with tall trees and moss, but fewer species overall.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“The boundary is as sharp as one meter. It’s like a binary, zero to one transition,” says study coauthor Mingzhen Lu, an ecologist at the Santa Fe Institute in New Mexico. This is far narrower than the transition zone between savanna and tropical rainforest, he says, which can occur over many kilometers. </p>



<p>To investigate what underlies these sharp borders, the team compared root samples from both fynbos and forest systems. They also conducted transplant experiments, moving Afro-temperate forest plants to the fynbos and tracking their growth over four years. The researchers kept fynbos plant roots away from the transplants and manipulated nutrient levels in some plots to unveil limiting factors for the forest plants.</p>



<p>When kept away from fynbos roots or offered more nitrogen, forest trees grew five times as fast as those that experienced competition or nutritional disadvantage, the team found. That suggests the fynbos plants keep invading plants away by monopolizing nutrient access.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Below the surface, the story becomes even clearer. The fynbos plants have long, thin roots that act like nutrient-seeking missiles, snaking through the soil where other roots can’t reach.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“That’s a competitive advantage,” Hedin says. “That’s an underground weapon.”</p>



<p>The median root tip thickness in the fynbos plant community is about 0.1 millimeters, or around one-quarter to one-half the thickness of any other root system in the world.&nbsp;“The thickest fynbos roots are still thinner than the thinnest [Afro-temperate] forest roots,” Lu says.</p>



<p>Compared to the forest plants, fynbos roots are also 10 times as long. A gram of some fynbos plants’ root tissue – about the mass of a thumbtack – can stretch over 15 football field lengths of territory.</p>



<p>The researchers think that the fynbos creates “nutritional misery” for any nonfynbos plant, making the soil around the fynbos nutrient poor with their hyper-efficient roots. Also, a large proportion of fynbos shrubs and grasses are highly flammable, making the ecosystem prone to particularly intense fires. The fires burn so hot that they volatilize soil nitrogen into the air, removing those nutrients from the area too. Rather than engineering their surroundings to enhance nutrient levels, the plants may be doing the opposite — sabotaging the nutrient supply — to give themselves the upper hand against would-be encroachers.</p>

<p>“You can try to invade, you’re not going to stand a chance,” Hedin says.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The fynbos-forest borders waver over the years between fire cycles, with the wet forest mostly rebuffing the flames and the fynbos eventually casting out trespassers.</p>



<p>A long prevailing idea about large ecological communities, Hedin says, is that they are largely driven by nonliving factors, such as climate, topography and geology, where organisms adapt to localized conditions. But in this case — and maybe others — “alternative stable states” arise from a war waging between organisms.</p>



<p>The findings demonstrate how pieces of this puzzle — fire, plant traits above and below ground and feedbacks between soil and plant, to start — illuminate the processes behind the creation and maintenance of the two coexisting vegetation zones, says Gerlinde de Deyn, a soil ecologist at Wageningen University &amp; Research in the Netherlands not involved with the research.</p>



<p>The thinness of the fynbos plants is “striking,” de Deyn says, but the role of root-associated fungi in the ecosystem needs to be addressed. These fungi are normally heavily involved in soil nutrient cycling and could be contributing to the roots’ efficient nutrient uptake, rather than the roots doing it all by themselves.&nbsp;<br><br>In the fynbos, there may also be lessons for how root traits help or hinder the spread of invasive plants, Lu says.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/covid-coronavirus-omicron-variant-mutation-infectious">How omicron’s mutations make it the most infectious coronavirus variant yet</a></h4>

              
                <p>In November, a new coronavirus variant took the world by storm. Omicron has since caused an unprecedented wave of infections, striking about 90 million people in just 10 weeks. That’s more COVID-19 cases than were recorded in all of 2020.</p>



<p>Omicron also left scientists scratching their heads. It’s riddled with mutations, which might normally doom a virus. Early experiments showed that omicron wasn’t nearly as good as the previous coronavirus variant champ, delta, at melding with a cell’s membrane — crucial for infecting that cell — or at replicating in lung cells. Yet here it was, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/omicron-delta-coronavirus-covid-variant-spread-speed">sweeping delta virtually off the map</a> in just weeks in some places (<em>SN: 2/10/22</em>). Omicron even managed to infect people who already had immunity to the virus from vaccines or previous cases of COVID-19. How, researchers wondered, was omicron doing it?</p>



<p>“It’s a very interesting variant,” says virologist Shan-Lu Liu, who codirects the Viruses and Emerging Pathogens Program at The Ohio State University in Columbus. “I call it weird.”</p>





<aside class="wp-block-sciencenews-inline-related-post alignleft"><h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/sign-up-for-e-mail-updates-on-the-coronavirus-outbreak">Sign up for e-mail updates on the latest coronavirus news and research</a></h4></aside>



<p>Researchers in Botswana and South Africa were the first to unveil omicron’s genetic makeup. Their analysis revealed more than 60 mutations, including 42 changes alone in omicron’s spike protein — the knobby structure on the surface of the virus that initiates a cell break-in and can help evade antibody defenses. Some of those mutations have popped up in previous variants, including alpha and delta. But omicron has never-before-seen tweaks and unique combinations of mutations.</p>



<p>Scientists have been scrambling to discover how those changes affect omicron’s ability to infect people and cause disease. Researchers around the world are infecting cells in lab dishes with omicron mimics, putting the virus under the microscope, testing the viral variant in lab animals and examining medical and other records all to discover what makes the variant tick. Here’s what scientists have found so far.</p>



<h4>1. Omicron keeps it together.</h4>



<p>The secret of omicron’s increased transmissibility has proven elusive. The spike protein is certainly one key to its success, <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41392-021-00852-5">allowing omicron to infect</a> nearly 10 times as many cells as earlier versions of the virus, researchers in China reported December 17 in <em>Signal Transduction and Targeted Therapy</em>.</p>



<p>It is “distinct from all other variants, from a structural point of view,” says structural biologist Priyamvada Acharya. She and her colleagues at the Duke Human Vaccine Institute in Durham, N.C., used cryo-electron microscopy and other techniques to examine omicron’s spike protein.</p>



<p>In past studies, researchers, including Acharya, have pinpointed how certain mutations have given previous variants a leg up. For instance, some <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/covid-delta-variant-mutations-coronavirus-life-cycle-2021">mutations in the delta variant’s spike protein</a> helped that version of the coronavirus more easily grab a human protein called ACE2 or more readily fuse with human cells (<em>SN: 12/16/21</em>). Omicron shares some of those mutations but has many others that drastically change how the variant behaves. “It’s not just one thing,” Acharya says. “It’s multiple properties of the spike that confer an advantage to omicron.”</p>



<p>Like other versions of the coronavirus, each of omicron’s knobby spikes consists of three identical pieces that snap together in a single unit. Each of those pieces has a jointed, fingerlike portion called the receptor binding domain that reaches out, much like the prongs of a claw machine, to grasp ACE2 and anchor the virus to the cell it will infect.</p>



<p>Many antibodies that prevent the virus from entering cells target those fingers. But omicron keeps its knuckles bent, <a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.01.25.477784v1?ct=">hiding the bits that antibodies will attack</a>, Acharya and colleagues reported in a preprint, which has not been peer reviewed yet, posted January 26 at bioRxiv.org.</p>

<h3>Acquiring more mutations</h3>



<p>The omicron variant of the coronavirus is more transmissible and can evade the immune system better than earlier versions of the virus, thanks in large part to mutations in spike protein. Shown here in red are locations of the mutations in the spike proteins of the delta (left) and omicron (right) variants.</p>

</div>



<p>This closed-fist strategy helps the variant evade the immune system. But the fingers eventually have to extend in order to grasp ACE2. Some mutations essentially spring-load omicron’s claw so that it can shoot out at least one finger to snag ACE2. That ensures some of the spike proteins studding the surface of the virus are always pointing the way to infect cells, Acharya and colleagues found.</p>



<p>Delta and alpha variants of the coronavirus were also likely to have multiple extended fingers, but those variants’ efforts to open up “went way too far … to the point that they lost control and fell apart,” Acharya says. Omicron contains mutations that stabilize the spike protein through hydrogen bonds — weak electrostatic connections between a positively charged hydrogen atom in one molecule with a negatively charged atom in another molecule. As a result, omicron doesn’t become floppy the way the earlier variants do, the Duke group discovered. Another group also found new <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.abn7760">hydrogen bonds and other connections</a> that help omicron keep itself together, researchers reported January 20 in <em>Science</em>. “I think omicron has struck just the right balance,” Acharya says.</p>



<h4>2. With omicron, opposites <em>really</em> attract.</h4>



<p>Simple attraction may be one key to omicron’s success.</p>



<p>“In the cellular environment, it can be difficult to find your partner,” says computational biologist Hin Hark Gan of New York University. Mutations in omicron’s receptor binding domain give that fingerlike portion of the protein a positive electric charge, Gan and NYU colleagues in New York City and Abu Dhabi reported February 14 at bioRxiv.org.</p>



<p>That electric charge complements ACE2’s negative charge, creating an electrostatic force that attracts the two proteins like a static-charged balloon to a wall, even over relatively long distances, the researchers propose in their preliminary report. Omicron’s electrostatic attraction to ACE2 is <a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.02.13.480261v1?ct=">three to five times greater than more neutrally charged delta’s</a>, the team found. The electrical attraction may make it easier for omicron to locate ACE2 on cells. Once the virus gets close to the human protein, other types of forces, including hydrogen bonds, cement the connection, he says.</p>



<div class="wp-block-sciencenews-content-sidebar">
<h3>Changing charge</h3>



<p>Mutations in the omicron spike protein (right) have made it more positively charged (blue) than the delta variant’s spike (left). The charge attracts omicron toward the negatively charged ACE2 protein on human cells even across relatively large distances. Negative charges are shown in red and neutral parts of the protein in white.</p>

<p>Multiple teams around the world have recently proposed another thing that makes omicron special: The variant may not use the same entry route into cells that earlier versions of the virus use.</p>



<p>There are <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/covid-19-coronavirus-hydroxychloroquine-no-evidence-treatment">two major ways the coronavirus can enter cells</a> (<em>SN: 8/2/20</em>). Both start with grabbing ACE2. In the direct route, a scissorslike protein called TMPRSS2 snips away part of the spike protein, revealing a portion that allows the virus to fuse with human cells and immediately dump its RNA inside to make new viruses. That is the way all previous versions of the SARS-CoV-2 have entered human cells.</p>



<p>But omicron may take a back door through a compartment inside the cell membrane called an endosome. There, a different scissorslike protein called cathepsin L cleaves the spike protein to allow the virus to dump its payload into the cell.</p>



<p>Omicron <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-022-04474-x_reference.pdf">doesn’t use the TMPRSS2 pathway efficiently</a> and <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-022-04479-6_reference.pdf">relies more on cathepsin</a> L to get into cells, two groups of researchers independently reported February 1 in <em>Nature</em>. As a result, omicron doesn’t fuse as well with cell membranes as delta does, those teams and other preliminary reports suggest.</p>



<p>That could seem like a handicap. But for omicron, it may be a good thing, Liu of Ohio State says. While the virus needs to fuse with cell membranes to get inside and replicate, too much fusibility may lead cells to merge with each other and die, he says. That would leave the virus with nowhere to copy itself.</p>



<p>Omicron may have struck the perfect balance between being fusible enough to enter cells, but not enough to kill its host, he says. This characteristic may also make omicron less likely to cause severe disease.</p>



<div class="wp-block-sciencenews-content-sidebar">
<h3>A different door</h3>



<p>Omicron may use an alternate entry route into cells compared with other coronavirus variants, some research suggests. After latching on to an ACE2 protein on a host cell’s surface, SARS-CoV-2 (red) usually goes through the front door, where a scissorslike protein called TMPRSS2 cuts off a part of the spike protein to unlock the door (as illustrated in the panel at left). But some data indicate omicron may use a back door, entering cells through endosomes, where a protein called cathepsin L is the locksmith (right).</p>

<p>Once in the endosome, though, the viruses come up against a gang of protein guards called IFTIMs that block entry. But both delta and <a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.12.31.474653v1">omicron have that problem licked: They breeze past</a> those backdoor guards, researchers in the United Kingdom reported January 3 at bioRxiv.org.</p>



<p>Still, some researchers are not convinced that omicron uses the endosome back door into cells. In mimics of human airways grown in lab dishes, omicron used the direct route, but <a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.01.19.476898v1">may be using a different — and still unknown — set of scissors</a> than TMPRSS2, Bart Haagmans, a virologist at Erasmus Medical Center in Rotterdam, the Netherlands, and colleagues reported January 20 at bioRxiv.org.</p>



<p>Haagman’s team infected various types of cells with omicron, delta or earlier versions of the coronavirus. In the first couple of days of infection, omicron infected more cells than delta did, and replicated faster, giving omicron a competitive edge.</p>



<p>Omicron was able to infect cells that don’t have an endosome back door but do have TMPRSS2. It infects these cells much less efficiently than earlier versions of virus do. In another experiment, a chemical that blocks cutting by TMPRSS2 and other similar scissors proteins stopped omicron from breaking into cells, suggesting that some sort of spike cutter is still needed. Together, those results indicate that omicron uses TMPRSS2 inefficiently and might use different scissors all together, the researchers conclude. Those unknown scissors aren’t on lung cells, as omicron has a hard time breaking into those cells in lab dishes, the team found. That work is still preliminary, Haagmans stresses, and it is difficult to predict from studies of cells grown in lab dishes how the virus will behave in humans.</p>



<p>Acharya’s group sees another possibility: Omicron may not need scissors to trim it before it can enter cells. Some of omicron’s mutations may expose the fusion peptide portion of the spike responsible for melding the virus with cells. It’s possible that omicron could fuse directly with cells without being snipped, she speculates. &nbsp;</p>



<p>Omicron may use multiple routes for cell entry, depending on which type of cell it is infecting and what host proteins are available, Liu says. “It’s mixed. It’s not one or the other,” he says. Using different scissors or entry routes would allow omicron to break into potentially more types of cells than other versions of the virus could crack.</p>



<p>But the entry point may not matter as much as other of omicron’s characteristics, Liu says. “My take is that the major reason that this [version of the] virus spreads so fast is because it evades antibody protection.”</p>



<h4>4. Omicron is evasive.</h4>



<p>As omicron took over globally, it quickly became obvious that the variant could slip past antibodies and patrolling immune cells. <a>Unvaccinated people remained the most likely to get infected, with </a><a href="https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#rates-by-vaccine-status">3,230.1 of every 100,000 unvaccinated people</a> developing a case of COVID-19 at the height of the omicron peak on January 8, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. &nbsp;</p>



<p>But a startling 1,467.31 of every 100,000 fully vaccinated people also got breakthrough infections at that time. And fully vaccinated people who got a booster dose were still being infected at a rate of 1,053.6 for every 100,000 people on January 8. That far exceeds even slippery delta’s peak rate of 699.12 of every 100,000 unvaccinated and 140.8 of every 100,000 fully vaccinated people on August 28.</p>



<p>A study of the Moderna vaccine’s effectiveness conducted at Kaiser Permanente Southern California in December found that two doses of the mRNA vaccine were about 80 percent effective at protecting against delta infection from 14 to 90 days after inoculation. That effectiveness slipped to 68.9 percent for people three to six months out from their second shot. A booster shot raised the effectiveness against delta infection back to nearly 94 percent, though it dipped to 86 percent after two months. Both two and three doses of the vaccine gave better than 99 percent protection against hospitalization from delta, researchers reported February 21 in <em>Nature Medicine</em>.</p>



<p>Contrast those figures with omicron. Two doses of Moderna’s vaccine were <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-022-01753-y">44 percent effective at preventing omicron infection</a> from 14 to 90 days after getting the shot, quickly dipping to 23.5 effectiveness in the three- to six-month period after getting jabbed. A booster shot brought the effectiveness against omicron infection up to 71.6 percent for about two months, after which it declined to 47.4 percent. Against hospitalization from omicron, two doses were 84.5 percent effective. A booster dose brought effectiveness against hospitalization back above 99 percent.</p>

<p>How did omicron manage to get past the highly effective vaccine? The variant swapped out or is missing some of the spots on the spike protein where antibodies latch on to other variants, multiple studies show. And new data that hasn’t yet been vetted by peer-review may suggest other reasons omicron is so sneaky.</p>



<p>First, the variant’s spike protein has that closed-fist stance that protects its ACE2-grabbing bits from antibodies. It has also changed shape slightly to tuck away other spots where antibodies can bind, helping the protein escape from the immune system, Acharya and colleagues found. For instance, one popular hitching post for antibodies is called the N-terminal domain, but there are so many mutations that, “omicron has completely destroyed the N-terminal domain for antibodies. Nothing binds there,” she says.</p>



<p>Another evasion tactic: Omicron is especially good at spreading from cell to cell where the immune system can’t catch it as easily as when it is outside of cells, Liu and colleagues reported December 20 at bioRxiv.org. Despite not being good at fusing cells together, the variant is <a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.12.16.472934v1.full.pdf">nearly 5 times better at cell-to-cell spread</a> than an early version of the virus.</p>



<p>Plus, the same electric charge that helps omicron’s receptor binding domain to hold ACE2 may repel antibodies, the New York University researchers found. The team tested a handful of monoclonal antibodies taken from people who had recovered from COVID-19 early in the pandemic. Just like the omicron spike protein, those antibodies all carried positive electrical charges, which may act like a force field keeping antibodies away from the spike protein.</p>



<p>A <a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.02.09.479776v1?ct=">strategically placed sugar molecule</a> stuck to the receptor binding domain may also obscure the spike protein from immune system attack, researchers at the University of Wisconsin–Madison reported February 10 at bioRxiv.org.</p>





<h4>5. Even with many mutations, omicron seems relatively mild.</h4>



<p>About the only good news about omicron is that it is less likely than the delta variant to cause severe disease. “It is definitely less virulent than delta,” says William Hanage, an epidemiologist at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health in Boston.</p>



<p>But there are <a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMp2119682">challenges to pinpointing just how dangerous omicron may be</a>, Hanage and Harvard colleague Roby Bhattacharyya discussed February 2 in the <em>New England Journal of Medicine</em>. Hospitals full of COVID-19 patients infected with omicron attest that the variant still has teeth and can cause severe illness or kill people. While <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/71/wr/mm7107e2.htm?s_cid=mm7107e2_w">v</a><a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/71/wr/mm7107e2.htm?s_cid=mm7107e2_w">accines</a> and immunity from prior or <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/scitranslmed.abn8057">breakthrough infections</a> may blunt omicron’s edge, its increased infectiousness and slipperiness may offset its reduced nastiness.</p>



<p>Even so, “you would definitely rather have 750,000 daily cases of omicron than delta, because delta would be much worse,” Hanage says. For instance, the <a href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/1054357/Technical-Briefing-36-11February2022_v2.pdf">risk of dying from omicron is about 60 percent lower</a> than the risk of death from a delta infection, the United Kingdom’s Health Security Agency reported February 11.</p>



<p>One reason for omicron’s relative mildness may be that it <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-022-04479-6_reference.pdf">doesn’t replicate as well in lung cells</a> as it does in the airways that feed the lungs, researchers in Hong Kong reported February 1 in <em>Nature</em>. That finding, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/omicron-coronavirus-covid-variant-severity-antibodies">initially reported</a> in December, has also been confirmed with preliminary work from Haagmans and others (<em>SN: 12/21/21</em>).</p>



<p>Another omicron Achilles’ heel may be that it <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41422-022-00619-9">triggers interferon responses</a>, the frontline of the immune system’s antiviral defenses, a study published January 21 in <em>Cell Research</em> found.</p>



<p>Gan of New York University speculates that omicron’s positive charge may cause the viral variant to get trapped in negatively charged mucus more easily than previous variants were.</p>



<p>Still, “omicron can be dangerous in a number of ways,” including landing vulnerable people in the hospital and sickening large numbers of hospital staff at the same time, Hanage says. “It is definitely milder, but that’s not a reason to chill.”</p>



<p>Add to that the fact that a <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/covid-pandemic-endemic-variant-dimmer-switch">sibling version of omicron called BA.2</a>, which has some different mutations from the original omicron, has now burst on the scene (<em>SN: 2/24/22</em>). BA.2 seems to be slightly more infectious than the original version. Though cases of omicron are falling overall, BA.2’s proportion of those cases is growing, and some experts warn that it could prolong the omicron outbreak or lead to another wave of infections.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/sponge-kitchen-bacteria-microbe-diversity">Why kitchen sponges are the perfect home for bacteria</a></h4>

              
                <p>Ask bacteria where they’d like to live, and they’ll answer: a kitchen sponge, please.</p>



<p>Sponges are microbe paradises, capable of housing 54 billion bacteria per cubic centimeter. In addition to being damp, airy and loaded with food scraps, sponges <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41589-021-00961-w">provide an optimal physical environment for bacteria</a>, researchers report February 10 in <em>Nature Chemical Biology.</em></p>



<p>Just like humans, bacteria prefer different levels of interactions with their peers. Some bacteria are more social, while others prefer solitude. Lingchong You, a synthetic biologist at Duke University, and colleagues wondered how separating different types of microbes would affect their community interactions. They found that intermediate levels of separation — similar to that found in a sponge — maximize the diversity of the community.</p>





<p>The researchers distributed different strains of <em>E. coli </em>onto plates with anywhere from six to 1,536 wells, which functioned as isolated compartments. After 30 hours, the team examined the number and types of bacterial strains on each plate. <strong></strong></p>





<p>Each compartment is like a party to which the bacteria were randomly assigned, You says. With only six compartments, each party probably has a similar mix of characters, and only the social bacteria survive. With 1,536 compartments, each microbe is probably alone, and the social bacteria die. But an intermediate number of compartments maximizes the odds that a microbe attends the party it prefers. An antisocial microbe might die at a party that’s dominated by socializers, but another antisocial microbe might wind up at a chill gathering and survive. Biodiversity is preserved.</p>



<p>“In retrospect, it’s very, very intuitive,” You says. “What we have identified is a principle that&#8217;s universally applicable for any microbial communities.”</p>



<p>Kitchen sponges, with an array of large and small holes, not only offer an ideal number of compartments for bacteria, but also provide a range of varying-sized parties that can suit more of the microbes’ needs. In experiments with a kitchen sponge, the researchers found that the resulting bacterial community was more diverse than those produced in liquid cultures, a common method of growing bacteria in a laboratory.</p>

<p>Fortunately, the bacteria partying in your sponge are mostly nonpathogenic. But if dangerous bacteria — like <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/blog/science-the-public/chicken-poses-significant-drug-resistant-salmonella-threat"><em>Salmonella</em> from raw chicken</a> — do show up, the sponge’s optimal structure will probably help them survive (<em>SN: 8/9/10</em>).</p>



<p>“Sponges are not really well-suited for kitchen hygiene,” says Markus Egert, a microbiologist at Furtwangen University in Villingen-Schwenningen, Germany, who was not involved in the study. “There&#8217;s hardly any sterile surface at home, but the kitchen sponge is probably the most densely populated item at home.”</p>



<p>The good news is that it’s easy to solve the problem. Brushes are a much safer alternative. And if you love your sponge, don’t use it for meat juices. No need to invite bad bacteria to the party.</p>

                <p><em>By </em><a href="http://emilyoliviareynolds.com/">Emily Reynolds</a></p>



<p>There are many factors that impact our health, from our <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2021/05/27/financial-stress-in-early-adulthood-is-related-to-physical-pain-decades-later/">finances</a> to our <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2019/02/08/there-are-some-intriguing-differences-between-the-usa-and-japan-in-how-emotions-influence-health/">emotions</a> to the <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2021/04/15/good-time-management-seems-to-have-a-bigger-impact-on-wellbeing-than-work-performance/">way we work</a>. Education is one such factor, with research suggesting that higher levels of education can lead to better health and even a longer life. But what about the education of your partner?</p>



<p>This is the subject of a new <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/00221465211063879">study</a> from an Indiana University team, published in the <em>Journal of Health and Social Behaviour</em>. The researchers find that people’s own health is positively associated with their spouse’s level of education, suggesting that education and other factors such as knowledge, skills and finances can be seen as shared resources.</p>



<span id="more-45570"></span>



<p>The team used data from a longitudinal study first administered to graduating high school seniors in Wisconsin in 1957 and at various points until 2011. Siblings of these graduates were also surveyed multiple times between 1977 and 2011, and spouses and sibling’s spouses in 2004 and 2006. Surveys were completed via the phone and mail.</p>



<p>For this study, surveys from 2004 to 2006 were most relevant. The team looked at the educational attainment of the original participants (as well as their spouses, their siblings and their siblings’ spouses), measured by years spent in education. Participants and siblings also characterised their own health, indicating whether it was “very poor”, “poor”, “fair”, “good” or “excellent”, and answered retrospective questions about their health before marriage, up to the age of 16. Finally, participants indicated whether or not they had ever smoked and for how long.</p>



<p>All this data allowed the researchers to look at pairs of siblings, to see how the education level of each of their spouses impacted their health. The benefit of this analysis is that it makes it less likely that any differences in health could be the result of hard-to-measure differences in social upbringing: after all, siblings are likely to have had a very similar upbringing. And the team found that spousal education was indeed a significant predictor of self-reported health: a sibling whose spouse had a higher level of education tended to report better health. This remained the case when adjusting for other factors that the team <em>could</em> measure, such as participants’ own education, social background, and health status before and after marriage.</p>



<p>The authors suggest that high levels of education provide shared social, intellectual, emotional, and financial resources (though this also depends on a person’s ability to share those resources with others) — things like higher levels of emotional intelligence, particular skills or knowledge, or more money. So although an individual’s own level of education is clearly important for their health, they also reap the benefits of their partner’s education.</p>



<p>Interestingly, the effects varied by gender: for women, self-reported health was more closely tied to their spouse’s education than for men. The team suggests this may have something to do with the time period the study took place — women in this sample had lower levels of education and lower occupational achievements than the men, suggesting that their male spouse’s resources were more likely to have a shared impact.</p>



<p>This also points to a limitation of the paper: the time period of the study may limit its generalisability to more modern relationships. Future work on this topic could explore whether the increased effect in women would still persist in today’s somewhat more equal world.</p>
