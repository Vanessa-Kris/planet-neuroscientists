            <p>This is the first issue of my journal of theoretical neuroscience.</p>
<p>Every month (hopefully) in this micro-journal, I select a few papers I have read, which I think are interesting for <a href="http://romainbrette.fr/what-is-computational-neuroscience-i-definitions-and-the-data-driven-approach/">computational or theoretical neuroscience</a>. These are not necessarily theoretical papers, in which case I explain why I think they are interesting for theoretical neuroscience. This is typically a mixture of new papers (including preprints) and old papers. This is of course a very personal selection, around the topics I am especially interested in, including: spike initiation, sensory systems, autonomous behavior.</p>

<p><i><b></b></i><strong>Editorial</strong></p>
<p>This month, I have selected 4 papers on spike initiation (1-4), 1 classical paper on the theory of brain energetics (5), and 1 paper on bibliometrics (6). Three of the papers on spike initiation (1-3) have in common that they are about the relation between geometry (morphology of the neuron and spatial distribution of channels) and excitability. Spikes are initiated in a small region called the axon initial segment (AIS), and this region is very close to the soma. Thus there is a discontinuity in both the geometry (big soma, thin axon) and the spatial distribution of channels (lots in the AIS). It has great impact on excitability, but this has not been very deeply explored theoretically. In fact, as I have discussed in a recent review (<a href="http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article/file?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1004114&amp;type=printable">Brette, 2015</a>), most theory on excitability (dynamical systems theory) has been developed on isopotential models, and so is largely obsolete. So there is much to do on spike initiation theory that takes into account the soma-AIS system.</p>

<p><strong>Selection</strong></p>
<p><em>1. Evans MD, Tufo C, Dumitrescu AS and MS Grubb. (2017). <a href="http://biorxiv.org/content/biorxiv/early/2017/01/19/101584.full.pdf">Myosin II activity is required for structural plasticity at the axon initial segment</a>.</em></p>
<p>A number of studies have shown that the AIS can move over hours or days, with various manipulations such as depolarizing the neuron (as in this study) or stimulating it optogenetically. Two open questions: what are the molecular mechanisms involved in this displacement? Is it actually a displacement or is it just that stuff is removed at one end and inserted at the other end? The same lab previously addressed the first question, showing the involvement of somatic L-type calcium channels and calmodulin. This study shows that myosin (the stuff of muscle, except not the type expressed in muscles) is involved, which strongly suggests that it is an actual displacement; this is in line with previous studies showing that dendrites and axons are contractile structures (e.g. <a href="https://elifesciences.org/content/3/e03159">Roland et al. (2014)</a>). This and previous studies start to provide building blocks for a model of activity-dependent structural plasticity of the AIS (working on it!).</p>

<p>Full disclosure: I am an author of this paper. In the lab, we are currently interested in the relation between neural geometry and excitability. In particular, what is the electrical impact of the location of the axon initial segment (AIS)? Experimentally, this is a difficult question because manipulations of AIS geometry (distance, length) also induce changes in Nav channel and other channel properties, in particular phosphorylation (<a href="https://kclpure.kcl.ac.uk/portal/files/54487324/Rapid_Modulation_of_Axon_EVANS_Accepted_22Sept2015_GOLD_VoR.pdf">Evans et al., 2015</a>). So this is typically a good question for theorists. I have previously shown that moving the AIS away from the soma should make the neuron more excitable (lower spike threshold), everything else being equal (<a href="http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article/file?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003338&amp;type=printable">Brette, 2013</a>). Here we look at what happens after axonal spike initiation, when the current enters the soma (I try to avoid the term “backpropagate”, see <a href="http://biorxiv.org/content/biorxiv/early/2016/04/14/037549.full.pdf">Telenczuk et al., 2016</a>). The basic insight is simple: when the axonal spike is fully developed, the voltage gradient between soma and start of the AIS should be roughly 100 mV, and so the axonal current into the soma should be roughly 100 mV divided by resistance between soma and AIS, which is proportional to AIS distance. Next, to charge a big somatodendritic compartment, you need a bigger current. So we predict that big neurons should have a more proximal AIS. This is what the data obtained by Kole’s lab show in this paper (along with many other things, as our theoretical work is a small part of the paper – as often, most of the theory ends up in the <a href="http://www.pnas.org/content/suppl/2016/11/30/1607548113.DCSupplemental/pnas.201607548SI.pdf">supplementary</a>).</p>

<p>Using simulations of detailed models, the authors propose to explain the observation of spikelets in vivo (small all-or-none events) by the failed propagation of axonal spikes to the soma. Under certain circumstances, they show that a spike generated at the distal axonal initiation site may fail to reach the somatic threshold for AP generation, so that only the smaller axonal spike is observed at the soma. This paper provides a nice overview of the topic and I found the study convincing. There is in fact a direct relation to our paper discussed above (<a href="http://www.pnas.org/content/113/51/14841.full.pdf?with-ds=yes">Hamada et al., 2016</a>): this study shows how the axonal spike can fail to trigger the somatic spike, which explains why the AIS needs to be placed at the right position to prevent this. One can argue (speculatively) that if AIS position is indeed tuned to produce the right amount of somatic depolarization, then sometimes this should fail and result in a spikelet (algorithm: if no spikelet, move AIS distally; if spikelet, move AIS proximally).</p>

Mensi S, Hagens P, Gerstner W and C Pozzorini (2016). <a href="http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article/file?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1004761&amp;type=printable">Enhanced Sensitivity to Rapid Input Fluctuations by Nonlinear Threshold Dynamics in Neocortical Pyramidal Neurons</a>.</em></p>
<p>I had to love this paper, because the authors basically experimentally confirm every theoretical prediction we had made in our paper on spike threshold adaptation (<a href="http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article/file?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1001129&amp;type=printable">Platkiewicz and Brette, 2011</a>). Essentially, what we had done is derive the dynamics of spike threshold from the dynamics of Nav channel inactivation. There were a number of non-trivial predictions, such as the shortening of the effective integration time constant, sensitivity to input variance, the specific way in which spike threshold depends on membrane potential, and the interaction between spike-triggered and subthreshold adaptation (that we touched upon in the discussion). This study uses a non-parametric model-fitting approach in cortical slices to empirically derive the dynamics of spike threshold (indirectly, based on responses to fluctuating currents), and the results are completely in line with our theoretical predictions.</p>

<p><em>5. Attwell D and SB Laughlin (2001). <a href="http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1097/00004647-200110000-00001">An energy budget for signaling in the grey matter of the brain</a> (<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11598490#cm11598490_49684">Pubmed Commons</a>; <a href="https://pubpeer.com/publications/0696DDEC91F6E5BA528FD34350EF96">PubPeer</a>).</em></p>
<p>This is an old but important paper on energetics of the brain, in particular: how much does it cost to maintain the resting potential? How much does it cost to propagate a spike? The paper explains some theoretical ideas to do these estimations, and is also a good source for relevant empirical numbers. It is important though to look at follow-up studies, which have addressed some issues, for example action potential efficiency is underestimated in this study. One problem in this study is the estimation of the cost of the resting potential, which I think is just wrong (<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11598490#cm11598490_49684">see my detailed comment</a> on Pubmed Commons; I believe the authors will soon respond). Unfortunately, I think it is really hard to estimate this cost by theoretical means; it would require knowing the permeability at rest to various ions, most importantly in the axon.</p>

<p><em>6. Brembs B, Button K and M Munafò (2013). <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1301.3748.pdf">Deep Impact: Unintended consequences of journal rank</a>.</em></p>
<p>The authors look at the relation between journal rank (derived from impact factor) and various indicators, for example effect sizes reported, statistical power, etc. In summary, they found that the only thing journal rank strongly correlates with is the proportion of retractions and frauds. Another interesting finding is about the predictive power of journal rank on future citations. There is obviously a positive correlation since impact factor measures the number of citations. But it is really quite small (see my <a href="http://romainbrette.fr/you-are-not-a-good-scientist-if-you-use-impact-factors-for-evaluating-research/">post on this</a>). What is most interesting is that the predictive power started increasing in the 1960s, when the impact factor was introduced. This strongly suggests that, rather than being a quality indicator, the impact factor biases the citations of papers (increases the visibility of otherwise equally good papers). This paper also shows evidence of manipulation of impact factors by journals (including Current Biology, whose impact factor went from 7 to 12 after its acquisition by Elsevier), and is generally a good source of references on the subject.</p>

            <p><em>Co-written by Dr. Marissé Masis-Solano.</em></p>
<p>Imagine that you’re standing on one leg. To avoid falling down, you integrate multiple sources of information: visual motion of objects gives information about the velocity of your head, while proprioceptive input from the neck joint gives information about the head’s position relative to the body. Pressure sensations from the footpads and muscle activity in the lower limbs reflect lower body leaning. The loss of any these inputs — for example, closing your eyes — means you’re much more likely to fall down.</p>
<figure class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_6508" style="width: 478px;"><img />(C) 20th Century Fox</figure>
<p>In this post, we’ll explore what happens when people lost perhaps the most important contributor to the sense of equilibrium: the vestibule. <span id="more-6503"></span>The vestibular apparatus is a sensory organ located in the inner ear. It consists of the semicircular canals, which measure angular acceleration, and the saccule and utricule, which measure linear acceleration and gravity. Together, they relay information about the head’s orientation in space, much like the gyros and accelerometers in a smartphone measure the device’s tilt.</p>
<figure class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 1899px;"><img height="1158" src="https://i2.wp.com/projects.cbe.ab.ca/Diefenbaker/Biology/Bio%20Website%20Final/notes/nervous_system/Image59.gif" width="1899" /><a href="http://projects.cbe.ab.ca/Diefenbaker/Biology/Bio%20Website%20Final/notes/nervous_system/9_the_ear.html">Source</a></figure>
<p>When the head turns rapidly, the liquid in the 3 semi-circular canals stays in place due to its inertia, then slowly catches up, triggering hair cells within the ampulae of the canals. That leads to a rapid increase in firing rate in the vestibular nerve, which relays this information to the brain stem and cerebellum.</p>
<figure class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_6518" style="width: 434px;"><img />Vestibular hair cells — the hairs at the top move when liquid moves within the inner ear. [<a href="http://otopathologynetwork.org/tbimages/chapter2/image148/">Source</a>]</figure>
<h1>Wobblers</h1>
<p>The first chapter of Doidge (2007) tells the fascinating story of people with bilateral vestibular damage (BVD). People with BVD sometimes call themselves <i>wobblers</i>: they can have normal equilibrium as long as their eyes are open and all motions are performed slowly. But when moving rapidly or when their eyes are closed, equilibrium is lost, resulting in a characteristic wobbly gait.</p>
<p></p><figure class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_6526" style="width: 637px;"><img alt="OLYMPUS DIGITAL CAMERA" class=" size-full wp-image-6526 aligncenter" src="https://xcorr.files.wordpress.com/2017/01/4.jpg?w=748" />&lt;figcaption class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Streptomycin ototoxicity [<a href="http://otopathologynetwork.org/tbimages/chapter6/image004/">Source</a>]&lt;/figcaption&gt;</figure>BVD is most often due to hair cell damage caused by ototoxic drugs. The aminoglycoside family of antibiotics in particular is associated with BVD (Roland 2003), which results in catastrophic loss of equilibrium. Gentamicin is the most frequent culprit, while amikacin and streptomycin can also damage both vestibular and cochlear cells. Balance can be affected in up to 15% of patients taking gentamicin (Fausti 1999, Fee 1980).<p></p>
<p>Equilibrium in people with BVD can be treated with <i>sensory substitution</i>, relaying information equivalent to that of the vestibule through another sense, and letting the brain’s plasticity take care of integrating the new information seamlessly. Doidge (2007) talks about a particular form of sensory substitution for people with BVD: <i>BrainPort</i>.</p>
<h1>Sensory substitution for people with BVD</h1>
<p>BrainPort came from a long line of development into sensory substitution for people suffering from blindness. In the early 70’s, the neuroscientist Paul Bach y Rita experimented with relaying visual information to blind people through their intact senses. He first built a chair with several actuators that could vibrate at multiple points on a person’s back. He connected a film camera to the actuators, relaying brightness information via vibration, and demonstrated basic recognition — blind people could identify the the orientation of lines and recognize large familiar objects after some experience with the chair.</p>

As you can judge from the shape of the somatosensory homunculus, the tongue is highly over-represented in the brain, and it contains a very high number of touch receptors compared to its size. Furthermore, it comes with its own saline solution, saliva — it’s thus ideally suited to be directly stimulated through electric impulses with a miniature device. Thus was born BrainPort, a sensory substitution device which can relay  visual information to a blind person though the tongue.<p></p>

He attached a gyro to a plastic hard hat, filtered that information minimally, and relayed the information through BrainPort. When the patient tilted their head to the right, they got a jolt on the right side of the tongue; when they tilted their head forward, they felt a jolt at the front of the tongue, and so forth.<p></p>
<figure class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_6551" style="width: 622px;"><img alt="screenshot-from-2017-01-23-215917" class=" size-full wp-image-6551 aligncenter" src="https://xcorr.files.wordpress.com/2017/01/screenshot-from-2017-01-23-215917.png?w=748" />&lt;figcaption class="wp-caption-text"&gt;As measured by an accelerometer, people with BVD experience large sway over time (y axis in degrees; middle plot). With vestibular substitution, they see a large decrease in sway (bottom plot)&lt;/figcaption&gt;</figure>
<p>When the device was turned on, he saw an immediate and profound decrease in oscillatory movement in people with BVD. The mapping between vestibular and somatosensory information was sufficiently simple that very little training with the device was necessary.</p>
<h1>Long-term effects of sensory substitution</h1>
<p>Perhaps most intriguing is that after several months of training with the device, oscillatory movements decreased <i>when the device was off</i>. At first, improved equilibrium persisted for a few minutes after turning the device off; after having trained with the device for an hour a day for a few months, however, the improvement persisted first for a few hours, and then for a few days, and eventually where the improvement became persistent.</p>
<p>That might seem a little magical, but it seems to be driven by long-term plasticity. We know that following vestibular deinnervation, there’s behavioural compensation after an initial period of complete loss of equilibrium; subjects learn to compensate through proprioception, somatosensation, vision, and efference copy. Furthermore, what drives this compensation is plasticity, with multi-sensory neurons increasing their sensitivity to non-vestibular signal (Sadeghi et al. 2012).</p>
<p>To optimally fuse the information from several noisy sensors, more reliable signals should be integrated with a higher weight. BrainPort’s stickiness might work by giving the brain a reference signal against which it can measure the accuracy of other equilibrium sensors. Indeed, we know that single neurons in the parietal cortex perform this type of Bayesian sensor fusion (Fetsch et al. 2012), and might reweight the signals through plasticity using BrainPort as reference.</p>
<p>BrainPort could lead to long-term improvement in equilibrium by a second mechanism: by recalibrating the residual vestibular input. Not every hair cell dies after BVD; there’s residual signal, perhaps 2-5% of the original signal strength, that comes through the vestibular nerve.</p>
<figure class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_6574" style="width: 970px;"><img alt="1714-06" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-6574" src="https://xcorr.files.wordpress.com/2017/01/1714-06.jpg?w=748" />&lt;figcaption class="wp-caption-text"&gt;An accelerometer, a gyro and a magnetometer on a breakout board from <a href="https://www.adafruit.com/product/1714">Adafruit</a>. With some Kalman filtering, the gyroscope can use the accelerometer as its reference to prevent drift.&lt;/figcaption&gt;</figure>
<p>The signals measured by the semi-circular canal are proportional to angular acceleration and jerk. To infer the head’s tilt, the signals must be integrated twice, which makes them vulnerable to drift. A small systematic error in the acceleration signal, due to an incorrect calibration, gets integrated over time, and eventually blows up to a large error. The brain now thinks the head is an entirely different position that it actually is.</p>
<p>Drift is not just a problem for the vestibule, it’s a general problem in angular accelerometers — it also afflicts solid-state gyros. To avoid this problem, in the vestibule as in electronics, angular acceleration must be integrated with another signal that doesn’t suffer from drift — linear acceleration. Unfortunately, BVD also affects the parts of the vestibule that respond to linear acceleration — the utricule and saccule. The external signal from Brainport can serve as a reference signal against which to calibrate all of these signals, decreasing drift over months of plasticity.</p>
<h1>Practical sensory substitution methods</h1>
<p>As impressive as BrainPort is for patients with BVD, this form of therapy hasn’t moved much beyond stage I clinical trials. The main reason Brainport hasn’t taken off is that walking around with a piece of electronic in one’s mouth looks silly, and makes talking difficult. The most commonly used therapy these days uses sensory stimulation via <a href="http://www.sensorykinetics.com/index.php/products/parentsubmenu">a belt with integrated haptics and balance board system</a>.</p>
<div class="jetpack-video-wrapper">&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/CoZ3nHXArxQ?version=3&amp;amp;rel=1&amp;amp;fs=1&amp;amp;autohide=2&amp;amp;showsearch=0&amp;amp;showinfo=1&amp;amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;amp;wmode=transparent" style="border:0;" height="451" width="748" allowfullscreen="true" type="text/html" class="youtube-player"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;</div>
<p>These systems are, however, bulky and expensive. Because gentamicin is on the WHO list of essential medications, it’s available pretty much everywhere, including in rural hospitals in developing countries; that’s thousands of new people with BVD in developing countries every year.</p>
<p>Dr. Marissé Masis-Solano and I thus embarked on building a vestibular replacement system based on open-source electronics. Our goal was to make a system that would be easy to build for under a 100$. An IMU installed on the head would record its position, it would be beamed to a receiver device, and communicated via haptic motors installed in the palm. In the next few installments, we’ll show you how we’re building our solution.</p>

<p>A tough interview or critical match can generate such anxiety that it ends up sabotaging our hopes and fulfilling our fears. People adopt different ploys to drive it away, from meditating to enjoying a cigarette. But it’s another tactic at the centre of <a href="http://www.hbs.edu/faculty/Pages/item.aspx?num=51401">new research</a> published in <em>Organizational Behavior and Human Decision Processes</em>: the power of ritual. Many top-level performers use ritual to prepare for their game or show, whether this be chewing on <a href="http://www.mensjournal.com/expert-advice/10-habits-of-highly-successful-athletes-20131203/brian-urlacher">exactly two cookies</a> or <a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/music/features/leonard-cohen-before-the-gig-a-chant-in-latin-8104872.html">chanting Latin</a> – and the new research suggests many of the rest of us do too, with around half of a surveyed sample of participants admitting to trying it at least once. But is there a point to it?</p>
<p>The research, led by Harvard Business School’s Alison Woods Brooks, suggests there is. In a pair of studies, 250 participants had to cope with the pressure of having to sing part of a song to a stranger, the Journey “classic” <em>Don’t Stop Believing</em>. Just before they put their voice on show, participants in one condition were asked to conduct a short ritual: draw a picture of their feelings, sprinkle salt on it, recite a countdown aloud before throwing the paper in the trash.</p>
<p><span id="more-17783"></span></p>
<p>Using a pulse tracker to measure the participants’ heart rate, the researchers found that assigning them the singing task set their hearts racing. But they also found that practicing the ritual, compared to doing nothing, dropped participants’ heart rate down towards normal levels. Self-reported anxiety was also reduced, and ritual users produced singing of a higher quality in terms of pitch, volume and note duration. They didn’t just feel better; they performed better, too.</p>
<p>The next study asked whether ritual is effective in any challenging situation, or specifically in anxiety-provoking contexts. Participants all attempted the same set of maths problems, but the researchers told some of them they were “fun maths puzzles”, while telling others it was “a very difficult IQ test”; only the second group showed improved performance after completing a ritual beforehand, suggesting that anxiety alleviation is key.</p>
<p>How do rituals calm us down? Maybe it’s the chance to express oneself emotionally, known to be an effective method of reducing anxiety. But the definition of ritual used by Brooks – fixed routines with symbolic significance – doesn’t require any self-expression. And a neutral procedure – writing down a fixed sequence of numbers – turned out to work just as well in improving performance. However, when participants were told this procedure was just “a few random behaviours” it was less effective than when it was explicitly labelled as a ritual, confirming that the symbolic significance is an important component of the effect.</p>
<p>Small studies on “pre-performance routines” have been published in the past but their focus included more obviously functional practices, such as stretches and concentration exercises. This new work shows the specific benefits owing to ritual: the millennia-old cultural practice used to cope with the hunt, birth, and death. More modern anxiety management techniques such as expressive writing or CBT’s emotional appraisal are familiar parts of the psychologist’s toolkit, and may appear as overdue replacements for the methods of the past. But as Brooks and her colleagues conclude, “although some may dismiss rituals as irrational, those who enact rituals may well outperform the skeptics who forgo them.”</p>

 Islet transplantation is an established therapy for diabetes. We have previously shown that rat pancreata can be created from rat pluripotent stem cells (PSCs) in mice through interspecies blastocyst complementation. Although they were functional and composed of rat-derived cells, the resulting pancreata were of mouse size, rendering them insufficient for isolating the numbers of islets required to treat diabetes in a rat model. Here, by performing the reverse experiment, injecting mouse PSCs into Pdx-1-deficient rat blastocysts, we generated rat-sized pancreata composed of mouse-PSC-derived cells. Islets subsequently prepared from these mouse–rat chimaeric pancreata were transplanted into mice with streptozotocin-induced diabetes. The transplanted islets successfully normalized and maintained host blood glucose levels for over 370 days in the absence of immunosuppression (excluding the first 5 days after transplant). These data provide proof-of-principle evidence for the therapeutic potential of PSC-derived islets generated by blastocyst complementation in a xenogeneic host.

 The genomes of individuals with severe, undiagnosed developmental disorders are enriched in damaging de novo mutations (DNMs) in developmentally important genes. Here we have sequenced the exomes of 4,293 families containing individuals with developmental disorders, and meta-analysed these data with data from another 3,287 individuals with similar disorders. We show that the most important factors influencing the diagnostic yield of DNMs are the sex of the affected individual, the relatedness of their parents, whether close relatives are affected and the parental ages. We identified 94 genes enriched in damaging DNMs, including 14 that previously lacked compelling evidence of involvement in developmental disorders. We have also characterized the phenotypic diversity among these disorders. We estimate that 42% of our cohort carry pathogenic DNMs in coding sequences; approximately half of these DNMs disrupt gene function and the remainder result in altered protein function. We estimate that developmental disorders caused by DNMs have an average prevalence of 1 in 213 to 1 in 448 births, depending on parental age. Given current global demographics, this equates to almost 400,000 children born per year.

 Skin cancer, the most common human malignancy, is primarily diagnosed visually, beginning with an initial clinical screening and followed potentially by dermoscopic analysis, a biopsy and histopathological examination. Automated classification of skin lesions using images is a challenging task owing to the fine-grained variability in the appearance of skin lesions. Deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) show potential for general and highly variable tasks across many fine-grained object categories. Here we demonstrate classification of skin lesions using a single CNN, trained end-to-end from images directly, using only pixels and disease labels as inputs. We train a CNN using a dataset of 129,450 clinical images—two orders of magnitude larger than previous datasets—consisting of 2,032 different diseases. We test its performance against 21 board-certified dermatologists on biopsy-proven clinical images with two critical binary classification use cases: keratinocyte carcinomas versus benign seborrheic keratoses; and malignant melanomas versus benign nevi. The first case represents the identification of the most common cancers, the second represents the identification of the deadliest skin cancer. The CNN achieves performance on par with all tested experts across both tasks, demonstrating an artificial intelligence capable of classifying skin cancer with a level of competence comparable to dermatologists. Outfitted with deep neural networks, mobile devices can potentially extend the reach of dermatologists outside of the clinic. It is projected that 6.3 billion smartphone subscriptions will exist by the year 2021 (ref. 13) and can therefore potentially provide low-cost universal access to vital diagnostic care.

 Once considered provocative, the notion that the wisdom of the crowd is superior to any individual has become itself a piece of crowd wisdom, leading to speculation that online voting may soon put credentialed experts out of business. Recent applications include political and economic forecasting, evaluating nuclear safety, public policy, the quality of chemical probes, and possible responses to a restless volcano. Algorithms for extracting wisdom from the crowd are typically based on a democratic voting procedure. They are simple to apply and preserve the independence of personal judgment. However, democratic methods have serious limitations. They are biased for shallow, lowest common denominator information, at the expense of novel or specialized knowledge that is not widely shared. Adjustments based on measuring confidence do not solve this problem reliably. Here we propose the following alternative to a democratic vote: select the answer that is more popular than people predict. We show that this principle yields the best answer under reasonable assumptions about voter behaviour, while the standard ‘most popular’ or ‘most confident’ principles fail under exactly those same assumptions. Like traditional voting, the principle accepts unique problems, such as panel decisions about scientific or artistic merit, and legal or historical disputes. The potential application domain is thus broader than that covered by machine learning and psychometric methods, which require data across multiple questions.

 When faced with threat, the survival of an organism is contingent upon the selection of appropriate active or passive behavioural responses. Freezing is an evolutionarily conserved passive fear response that has been used extensively to study the neuronal mechanisms of fear and fear conditioning in rodents. However, rodents also exhibit active responses such as flight under natural conditions. The central amygdala (CEA) is a forebrain structure vital for the acquisition and expression of conditioned fear responses, and the role of specific neuronal sub-populations of the CEA in freezing behaviour is well-established. Whether the CEA is also involved in flight behaviour, and how neuronal circuits for active and passive fear behaviour interact within the CEA, are not yet understood. Here, using in vivo optogenetics and extracellular recordings of identified cell types in a behavioural model in which mice switch between conditioned freezing and flight, we show that active and passive fear responses are mediated by distinct and mutually inhibitory CEA neurons. Cells expressing corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF+) mediate conditioned flight, and activation of somatostatin-positive (SOM+) neurons initiates passive freezing behaviour. Moreover, we find that the balance between conditioned flight and freezing behaviour is regulated by means of local inhibitory connections between CRF+ and SOM+ neurons, indicating that the selection of appropriate behavioural responses to threat is based on competitive interactions between two defined populations of inhibitory neurons, a circuit motif allowing for rapid and flexible action selection.

            <p>Elucidation of the evolutionary history and interrelatedness of Plasmodium species that infect humans has been hampered by a lack of genetic information for three human-infective species: P. malariae and two P. ovale species (P. o. curtisi and P. o. wallikeri). These species are prevalent across most regions in which malaria is endemic and are often undetectable by light microscopy, rendering their study in human populations difficult. The exact evolutionary relationship of these species to the other human-infective species has been contested. Using a new reference genome for P. malariae and a manually curated draft P. o. curtisi genome, we are now able to accurately place these species within the Plasmodium phylogeny. Sequencing of a P. malariae relative that infects chimpanzees reveals similar signatures of selection in the P. malariae lineage to another Plasmodium lineage shown to be capable of colonization of both human and chimpanzee hosts. Molecular dating suggests that these host adaptations occurred over similar evolutionary timescales. In addition to the core genome that is conserved between species, differences in gene content can be linked to their specific biology. The genome suggests that P. malariae expresses a family of heterodimeric proteins on its surface that have structural similarities to a protein crucial for invasion of red blood cells. The data presented here provide insight into the evolution of the Plasmodium genus as a whole.</p><p>Nature   <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/nature21038">doi: 10.1038/nature21038</a></p><img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/NatureBiologicalSciencesResearch/~4/PsVHgW3g-6A" width="1" />

 Integrins are adhesion receptors that transmit force across the plasma membrane between extracellular ligands and the actin cytoskeleton. In activation of the transforming growth factor-β1 precursor (pro-TGF-β1), integrins bind to the prodomain, apply force, and release the TGF-β growth factor. However, we know little about how integrins bind macromolecular ligands in the extracellular matrix or transmit force to them. Here we show how integrin αVβ6 binds pro-TGF-β1 in an orientation biologically relevant for force-dependent release of TGF-β from latency. The conformation of the prodomain integrin-binding motif differs in the presence and absence of integrin binding; differences extend well outside the interface and illustrate how integrins can remodel extracellular matrix. Remodelled residues outside the interface stabilize the integrin-bound conformation, adopt a conformation similar to earlier-evolving family members, and show how macromolecular components outside the binding motif contribute to integrin recognition. Regions in and outside the highly interdigitated interface stabilize a specific integrin/pro-TGF-β orientation that defines the pathway through these macromolecules which actin-cytoskeleton-generated tensile force takes when applied through the integrin β-subunit. Simulations of force-dependent activation of TGF-β demonstrate evolutionary specializations for force application through the TGF-β prodomain and through the β- and not α-subunit of the integrin.

            <p>Temperature is a primary driver of the distribution of biodiversity as well as of ecosystem boundaries. Declining temperature with increasing elevation in montane systems has long been recognized as a major factor shaping plant community biodiversity, metabolic processes, and ecosystem dynamics. Elevational gradients, as thermoclines, also enable prediction of long-term ecological responses to climate warming. One of the most striking manifestations of increasing elevation is the abrupt transitions from forest to treeless alpine tundra. However, whether there are globally consistent above- and belowground responses to these transitions remains an open question. To disentangle the direct and indirect effects of temperature on ecosystem properties, here we evaluate replicate treeline ecotones in seven temperate regions of the world. We find that declining temperatures with increasing elevation did not affect tree leaf nutrient concentrations, but did reduce ground-layer community-weighted plant nitrogen, leading to the strong stoichiometric convergence of ground-layer plant community nitrogen to phosphorus ratios across all regions. Further, elevation-driven changes in plant nutrients were associated with changes in soil organic matter content and quality (carbon to nitrogen ratios) and microbial properties. Combined, our identification of direct and indirect temperature controls over plant communities and soil properties in seven contrasting regions suggests that future warming may disrupt the functional properties of montane ecosystems, particularly where plant community reorganization outpaces treeline advance.</p><p>Nature   <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/nature21027">doi: 10.1038/nature21027</a></p><img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/NatureBiologicalSciencesResearch/~4/pHyef4G9NKg" width="1" />

<p>When all around us feels like chaos, it’s human instinct to cling to the rocks of dogma, and woe betide anyone who tries to loosen our grip. Previous studies, usually involving strong religious believers, have shown how dogmatic beliefs allay the anxiety brought on by feelings of uncertainty. In turn, any groups with opposing views are treated with suspicion and prejudice. A <a href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/bjop.12186/abstract?campaign=woletoc">new study</a> in the <em>British Journal of Psychology</em> broadens this out, showing these processes aren’t unique to religious believers. Dogmatic atheists too seem to be motivated by the need to cope with uncertainty, and they too are prejudiced towards threatening groups, especially during times of uncertainty. The researchers at Jagiellonian University, led by Małgorzata Kossowska, suggest their findings have interesting implications for understanding political orientations and prejudices. The world feels especially unpredictable right now. Are we all, whatever our politics, clinging to our rocks more strongly than ever?</p>
<p><span id="more-17682"></span></p>
<p>Kossowska and her colleagues tested levels of dogmatic belief, whether religious or atheist, and intolerance of uncertainty, among 201 participants. They found that an inability to cope with uncertainty (as measured with the <a href="http://nymag.com/scienceofus/2015/12/this-quiz-shows-how-well-you-handle-uncertainty.html">Need for Closure scale</a>) correlated with dogmatic belief among religious people – Christians in this cultural context – but also with dogmatic belief among atheists. The researchers said this pattern suggests that, whatever your own religious or non-religious orientation, “dogmatic beliefs offer a global worldview full or rules and explanations and thereby reduce the complexity of life and create a psychologically safe and predictable environment.”</p>
<p>Next, the researchers tested the religious and atheistic beliefs and intolerance of 116 more participants, but this time they also manipulated some of them to experience feelings of uncertainty (participants rated their agreement with statements about times they’d felt uncertain, under the guise of it being a personality test). The researchers also tested their prejudice towards different social groups.</p>
<p>As before, a dislike of uncertainty correlated with dogmatic beliefs, both religious and atheist. More dogma also correlated with greater prejudice towards out-groups and seeing them as more threatening. Moreover, dogmatic believers of both stripes showed increased prejudice when primed to experience feelings of uncertainty. For the orthodox Christian believers, this manifested in increased prejudice towards homosexual people; for the dogmatic atheists, it was increased prejudice towards pro-life supporters.</p>
<p>The defence mechanism of dogmatic belief has in the past been seen as a feature of the religious and politically conservative. Kossowska and her team argue their findings suggest that uncertainty-fuelled dogma, and prejudice towards those who threaten that dogma, is a more universal phenomenon. “Prejudice is not limited only to religious believers or to those on the political right, but rather, as a response to uncertainty it may also occur among dogmatic atheists and the otherwise politically and socially liberal,” the researchers said.</p>

            <p>I present a novel (well, in 2009 it was) modular, stochastic model for biological template-based linear chain elongation processes. In this model, elongation complexes (eg DNA polymerase, RNA polymerase, or ribosomes associated with nascent chains) that span a finite number of template units step along the template, one after another, with semaphore constructs preventing overtaking. The central elongation module is readily extended with modules that represent initiation and termination processes. The model was used to explore the effect of elongation complex span on motor velocity and dispersion, and the effect of initiation activator and repressor binding kinetics on the overall elongation dynamics. The results demonstrate that (1) motors that move smoothly are able to travel at a greater velocity and closer together than motors that move more erratically, and (2) the rate at which completed chains are released is proportional to the occupancy or vacancy of activator or repressor binding sites only when initiation or activator/repressor dissociation is slow in comparison with elongation. If you think the above is a load of old hokum, do come to the talk for some more!</p>

<p>It’s a common belief that to make optimal decisions we need to be more logical and less emotional, rather like Mr Spock in Star Trek. In fact, much evidence argues against this. Consider the behaviour of patients whose brain damage has made them unusually cold and logical. Rather than this helping them make decisions, they often seem paralysed by indecision.</p>
<p>These patients, who usually have damage to parts of their frontal cortex, also tend to perform poorly on a game that’s used by psychologists to measure risk-taking behaviour: the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iowa_gambling_task">Iowa Gambling Task</a>. The neurologist and author Antonio Damasio thinks this is because they have lost the ability to incorporate gut instincts – literally, their visceral reactions – into their decision-making, an idea that forms the basis of his <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Somatic_marker_hypothesis">Somatic Marker Hypothesis</a>. This hypothesis has been very influential but the evidence supporting it, now gathered over several decades, is nearly all based on research using the Iowa Gambling Task.</p>
<p>In a <a href="http://psycnet.apa.org/journals/dec/4/1/52/">recent paper</a> in <em>Decision</em>, two British psychologists tested the Somatic Marker Hypothesis in a new context, the Balloon Analogue Risk Task, which involves deciding how far to pump a balloon. They found little evidence to support the central tenet of the Somatic Marker Hypothesis, the idea that our physiological reactions shape our decisions.</p>
<p><span id="more-17215"></span></p>
<p>Rebecca Wright at the University of Essex and Tim Rakow at King’s College London conducted three separate studies involving dozens of participants who completed different versions of the Balloon Analogue Risk Task. The basic version involved participants deciding how far to keep pumping a balloon depicted on-screen. The more participants pumped the balloon, the more points they acquired, which if banked could be traded for cash later. But if they pumped too far before banking their points, the balloon would burst, and the points would be lost. As participants played the task, the researchers measured the amount of perspiration on two of their fingers, which is a well-established physiological marker of emotional arousal.</p>
<p>Wright and Rakow wanted to see if they could find evidence of participants’ physiological reactions shaping their decision-making, comparable to what Damasio and others have found with the Iowa Gambling Task.</p>
<p>In the gambling task, there are four piles of cards, each made up of cards with a different mix of monetary values. Participants have to choose which piles to take cards from in order to end up with as much cash value as possible. The main evidence in support of the Somatic Marker Hypothesis is that when neurologically healthy people perform the task, they often show a physiological reaction (sweatiness of the skin) prior to considering picking cards from a bad pile, even before they realise at a conscious level that the pile is not an optimal one to pick from, thus guiding them towards more optimal choices.</p>
<p>During the balloon task, Wright and Rakow found some limited evidence to support the Somatic Marker Hypothesis. Bad outcomes – that is, when the balloon popped and points were lost – were associated with an increased sweat response. This can be seen as a “somatic mark” or visceral response associated with the experience of a bad outcome. Crucially, however, the researchers found no support for the more contentious idea that physiological responses were shaping participants’ decisions. The participants’ current sweat response was not associated with their upcoming decision about whether to keep pumping the balloon or bank their points.</p>
<p>“We find little support for skin conductance guiding decision-making – a core prediction of the Somatic Marker Hypothesis,” the researchers concluded. Now this is just one set of studies, so it would be rash to conclude from the new findings that the Somatic Marker Hypothesis has no merit. Also, there is a wider evidence-base, not tied directly to Somatic Marker Hypothesis, that supports the broader idea that bodily sensations can influence our decision-making: for instance, <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2012/10/11/people-make-more-moral-decisions-when-they-think-their-heart-is-racing/">a faster heart rate has been linked with making more moral decisions</a>. However, this study highlights the surprising fact that an influential theory in psychology is based on evidence collected in a very narrow context. And when tested in a new way, it has mostly failed.</p>

<p>“There is but one truly serious philosophical problem and that is suicide” the French author and philosopher Albert Camus stated. But it is not only philosophers who are moved by this issue. Psychologists are seeking ways of preventing this tragic death, and health care organisations are sounding the alarm. Around a million people die at their own hand every year, which makes suicide the tenth most common cause of death. Additionally, for every completed suicide, there are 10 to 40 survived attempts, which means that in the USA alone 650,000 people each year are taken to emergency rooms following an attempt on their own life. Yet what is most disturbing is that the number of suicides is continually rising. The WHO reports that since the 1960s this number has grown over 60 per cent.</p>
<p>Is psychology capable of identifying the risk factors that can push people to take their own lives? Joseph Franklin at Florida State University and his research team at the Technology and Psychopathy (TAP) Lab have provided an answer, but it is a disappointing one. Our capacity to predict whether someone will make a suicide attempt is no better than chance. What is worse, we have not made any progress in this area in the last half-century. These striking conclusions come as the result of a meta-analysis of 365 studies into suicide risk conducted over the last 50 years and published recently in <em>Psychological Bulletin</em> (<a href="http://www.apa.org/pubs/journals/releases/bul-bul0000084.pdf">pdf</a>).</p>
<p><span id="more-17189"></span></p>
<p>Should these results be seen as discrediting psychology, leading us to declare its incompetence in that sphere and that the matter should be left in the hands of philosophers? I would not be so quick to make that argument, although I do consider the findings to discredit a certain manner of practicing psychology. As Franklin and his colleagues observed, the problem with past research is that the methods have been extremely narrow. Most studies only looked at a single risk factor, such as depression or low serotonin in the brain, and then followed patients over a decade, while in real life it is generally the interaction of many factors of a given impact level that provide the fuel powering some sort of dramatic reaction.</p>
<p>Moreover, most often suicide is not caused by the simple sum of those factors, but from a complex interaction between them, yet the research methods generally applied by psychologists are not capable of uncovering such dynamics. Research on complex systems, which is most certainly an appropriate designation for the mind, long ago demonstrated that their characteristics are not always discernible when looking at constituent elements. Why, then, do the vast majority of psychologists so obstinately insist on treating people as simple machines that react linearly in response to simple stimuli?</p>
<p>I know of only one answer to this question. The single-factor approach is easier and generates the effects expected by scientists, such as grants for research, the conviction that they are engaged in important work, points for publications indispensable in making progress in one’s scientific career, participation in conference tourism, etc. Meanwhile, machines are increasingly overtaking researchers trapped in this mode of thinking. In the past two years, multiple groups have begun work developing “machine learning algorithms” to combine tens or even hundreds of risk factors together to predict suicidal behaviours. “The preliminary results are promising, with algorithms predicting suicidal behaviours with greater than 80 per cent accuracy, but this work is just in its initial phase,” said Franklin. “However, in the very near future, this work may produce accurate predictions of suicidal behaviours on a large scale.”</p>
<p>His team has already developed a free web app that has proven effective in trials at reducing suicidal behaviours. The app, called “<a href="http://tectectech.com">Tec-Tec</a>” uses a simple game to train users to see certain words and images in a different light (a form of “evaluative conditioning”) and is available on iTunes and Amazon right now. Studies have shown that the app reduced suicidal behaviours by about 50 per cent over the course of a month in hundreds of people, and they hope in the future to reach a reduction rate approaching 100 percent.</p>
<p>Does this mean that all the existing scales measuring the risk of suicidal behaviours should be thrown away, and the counsellors and therapists working on suicide prevention should think about getting a new job? In fact Franklin recommended therapists continue using the guidelines, but he added that there’s an urgent need to re-evaluate them.</p>
<p>Franklin’s cautious approach to the tools currently in use arises primarily from the fact that past studies have not looked at the impact of known risk factors over short time-spans (on average, they examined one risk factor over 10 years) where they may be more useful. Furthermore, previous studies examined only a portion of the measures from the far more expansive set that is used in clinical assessment.</p>
<p>Franklin also is likely aware that an experienced counsellor frequently relies on her or his own experience and clinical intuition together with more formal risk measures, and that these clinical judgments and measures together might be more effective than a mere coin-flip. Unfortunately, personal clinical intuition does not constitute a cohesive and reliable system of knowledge with significant predictive capacity: it can’t be taught or used by others. It would appear that to prevent more suicides in future, artificial intelligence could be a far better solution.</p>

 Cervical cancer remains one of the leading causes of cancer-related deaths worldwide. Here we report the extensive molecular characterization of 228 primary cervical cancers, the largest comprehensive genomic study of cervical cancer to date. We observed striking APOBEC mutagenesis patterns and identified SHKBP1, ERBB3, CASP8, HLA-A, and TGFBR2 as novel significantly mutated genes in cervical cancer. We also discovered novel amplifications in immune targets CD274/PD-L1 and PDCD1LG2/PD-L2, and the BCAR4 lncRNA that has been associated with response to lapatinib. HPV integration was observed in all HPV18-related cases and 76% of HPV16-related cases, and was associated with structural aberrations and increased target gene expression. We identified a unique set of endometrial-like cervical cancers, comprised predominantly of HPV-negative tumors with high frequencies of KRAS, ARID1A, and PTEN mutations. Integrative clustering of 178 samples identified Keratin-low Squamous, Keratin-high Squamous, and Adenocarcinoma-rich subgroups. These molecular analyses reveal new potential therapeutic targets for cervical cancers.

            <p>Mitochondria are double-membraned organelles with variable shapes influenced by metabolic conditions, developmental stage, and environmental stimuli. Their dynamic morphology is a result of regulated and balanced fusion and fission processes. Fusion is crucial for the health and physiological functions of mitochondria, including complementation of damaged mitochondrial DNAs and the maintenance of membrane potential. Mitofusins are dynamin-related GTPases that are essential for mitochondrial fusion. They are embedded in the mitochondrial outer membrane and thought to fuse adjacent mitochondria via combined oligomerization and GTP hydrolysis. However, the molecular mechanisms of this process remain unknown. Here we present crystal structures of engineered human MFN1 containing the GTPase domain and a helical domain during different stages of GTP hydrolysis. The helical domain is composed of elements from widely dispersed sequence regions of MFN1 and resembles the ‘neck’ of the bacterial dynamin-like protein. The structures reveal unique features of its catalytic machinery and explain how GTP binding induces conformational changes to promote GTPase domain dimerization in the transition state. Disruption of GTPase domain dimerization abolishes the fusogenic activity of MFN1. Moreover, a conserved aspartate residue trigger was found to affect mitochondrial elongation in MFN1, probably through a GTP-loading-dependent domain rearrangement. Thus, we propose a mechanistic model for MFN1-mediated mitochondrial tethering, and our results shed light on the molecular basis of mitochondrial fusion and mitofusin-related human neuromuscular disorders.</p><p>Nature   <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/nature21077">doi: 10.1038/nature21077</a></p><img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/NatureBiologicalSciencesResearch/~4/KYAO_OtMEms" width="1" />

 MicroRNAs (miRNAs) perform critical functions in normal physiology and disease by associating with Argonaute proteins and downregulating partially complementary messenger RNAs (mRNAs). Here we use clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR) and CRISPR-associated protein 9 (Cas9) genome-wide loss-of-function screening coupled with a fluorescent reporter of miRNA activity in human cells to identify new regulators of the miRNA pathway. By using iterative rounds of screening, we reveal a novel mechanism whereby target engagement by Argonaute 2 (AGO2) triggers its hierarchical, multi-site phosphorylation by CSNK1A1 on a set of highly conserved residues (S824–S834), followed by rapid dephosphorylation by the ANKRD52–PPP6C phosphatase complex. Although genetic and biochemical studies demonstrate that AGO2 phosphorylation on these residues inhibits target mRNA binding, inactivation of this phosphorylation cycle globally impairs miRNA-mediated silencing. Analysis of the transcriptome-wide binding profile of non-phosphorylatable AGO2 reveals a pronounced expansion of the target repertoire bound at steady-state, effectively reducing the active pool of AGO2 on a per-target basis. These findings support a model in which an AGO2 phosphorylation cycle stimulated by target engagement regulates miRNA:target interactions to maintain the global efficiency of miRNA-mediated silencing.

 Sexual reproduction in flowering plants involves double fertilization, the union of two sperm from pollen with two sex cells in the female embryo sac. Modern plant breeders increasingly seek to circumvent this process to produce doubled haploid individuals, which derive from the chromosome-doubled cells of the haploid gametophyte. Doubled haploid production fixes recombinant haploid genomes in inbred lines, shaving years off the breeding process. Costly, genotype-dependent tissue culture methods are used in many crops, while seed-based in vivo doubled haploid systems are rare in nature and difficult to manage in breeding programmes. The multi-billion-dollar maize hybrid seed business, however, is supported by industrial doubled haploid pipelines using intraspecific crosses to in vivo haploid inducer males derived from Stock 6, first reported in 1959 (ref. 5), followed by colchicine treatment. Despite decades of use, the mode of action remains controversial. Here we establish, through fine mapping, genome sequencing, genetic complementation, and gene editing, that haploid induction in maize (Zea mays) is triggered by a frame-shift mutation in MATRILINEAL (MTL), a pollen-specific phospholipase, and that novel edits in MTL lead to a 6.7% haploid induction rate (the percentage of haploid progeny versus total progeny). Wild-type MTL protein localizes exclusively to sperm cytoplasm, and pollen RNA-sequence profiling identifies a suite of pollen-specific genes overexpressed during haploid induction, some of which may mediate the formation of haploid seed. These findings highlight the importance of male gamete cytoplasmic components to reproductive success and male genome transmittance. Given the conservation of MTL in the cereals, this discovery may enable development of in vivo haploid induction systems to accelerate breeding in crop plants.

            <p>
 Collective oscillatory behaviour is ubiquitous in nature, having a vital role in many biological processes from embryogenesis and organ development to pace-making in neuron networks. Elucidating the mechanisms that give rise to synchronization is essential to the understanding of biological self-organization. Collective oscillations in biological multicellular systems often arise from long-range coupling mediated by diffusive chemicals, by electrochemical mechanisms, or by biomechanical interaction between cells and their physical environment. In these examples, the phase of some oscillatory intracellular degree of freedom is synchronized. Here, in contrast, we report the discovery of a weak synchronization mechanism that does not require long-range coupling or inherent oscillation of individual cells. We find that millions of motile cells in dense bacterial suspensions can self-organize into highly robust collective oscillatory motion, while individual cells move in an erratic manner, without obvious periodic motion but with frequent, abrupt and random directional changes. So erratic are individual trajectories that uncovering the collective oscillations of our micrometre-sized cells requires individual velocities to be averaged over tens or hundreds of micrometres. On such large scales, the oscillations appear to be in phase and the mean position of cells typically describes a regular elliptic trajectory. We found that the phase of the oscillations is organized into a centimetre-scale travelling wave. We present a model of noisy self-propelled particles with strictly local interactions that accounts faithfully for our observations, suggesting that self-organized collective oscillatory motion results from spontaneous chiral and rotational symmetry breaking. These findings reveal a previously unseen type of long-range order in active matter systems (those in which energy is spent locally to produce non-random motion). This mechanism of collective oscillation may inspire new strategies to control the self-organization of active matter and swarming robots.

            <p><em><img alt="Abandoned Teddy-bear lying headless on concrete ground" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-17578" src="https://researchdigest.files.wordpress.com/2017/01/thinkstockphotos-178885799.jpg?w=845" />By</em> <a href="http://www.alexfradera.net/">Alex Fradera</a></p>
<p>There has been little research into what it’s like for police detectives to investigate the death of a child. As bluntly stated in official police guidance documents “children are not meant to die”, and coping with these circumstances, especially as a detective and parent, could involve emotional and psychological demands beyond those experienced when investigating adult murders.</p>
<p>For a new explorative <a href="http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11896-016-9218-5">study</a> in the <em>Journal of Police and Criminal Psychology, </em>Jason Roach and his colleagues surveyed 99 police detectives from 23 forces across England and Wales: most of them were white and male, and they had conducted investigations into an average of 30 adult murders and 7 unexplained child deaths. Compared to dealing with adult homicides, the detectives said they felt more pressure to solve cases involving children, found them harder to deal with emotionally, and thought more about them after the cases had ended.</p>
<p><span id="more-17559"></span></p>
<p>The detectives also considered child cases to be more complex and said they were more likely to handle them by turning to formal guidance, such as the <em>Murder Investigation Manual</em>, which was published by the Association of Chief Police Officers in 2006. This suggests they wanted to do things by the book rather than relying on intuition, which seems sensible given the relative rarity of such cases.</p>
<p>Some of the emotional effects of child cases were weaker when detectives had experienced them within the last six months. This seems counterintuitive, but the researchers speculated that while dealing with any violent crime can deliver an emotional load in the short term, the impressions of a case involving a child are harder to shake, so its severity becomes more obvious over time.</p>
<p>The research shows that seniority provided no bulwark against being shaken by these cases. In fact, more senior detectives reported higher levels of impact on their home life, and had significantly more trouble sleeping and more ruminative thoughts. They were even more likely to turn to the <em>Murder Investigation Manual</em> and other guidance to support them in these cases, suggesting that they accepted these are high-grade cases to handle. The effects of rank were also found in investigations of adult cases, but to a lesser extent.</p>
<p>The 83 per cent of the detectives who had children of their own, had a slightly different take from their childless counterparts, reporting that they were less able to control their emotions when working on the child cases, and that they were more focused on them. So the cases hit closer to home, making them both harder and more important. The younger their own children, the more emotional blowback the detectives reported experiencing.</p>
<p>This is an explorative study so the findings need to be treated carefully. But the research reveals a world that before now most of us have only encountered through the imaginations of screenwriters. Unlike their fictional counterparts, the real-life detectives didn’t report becoming hardened to child death, but if anything were more sensitive later in their careers, which suggests they may benefit from psychological support services just as much as early career officers.</p>
<p>The research also suggests that there may be value in targeting support downstream from difficult cases, to help detectives work through residual experiences that are proving hard to shift. As Roach and his team conclude, “further research must continue to explore how investigative decisions are made in such difficult and stressful circumstances if we are to give those good enough to do it as much self-protection as possible.”</p>

            <img alt="Zhu et al., 2016" class="attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image" height="150" src="http://blogs.plos.org/neuro/files/2017/01/Zhu-et-al.-2016-150x150.jpg" style="display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;" width="150" /><p>The 20<sup>th</sup> century has seen an explosion of scientific efforts made to reveal the biological substrates of cognitive functions. Research has shown that emotions and cognitive processes interact to build up complex behavioural responses and drive environmental adaptations. Fear, one of our noble and sophisticated adaptive brain functions, requires a perfect integration of emotional and cognitive inputs. Interactions of memory, learning and emotions then shape our actions. This dynamic understanding of the brain is a fairly recent development in neuroscience.</p>
<p>As <em>PLOS Biology</em> Associate Editor Gabriel Gasque writes to introduce a new PLOS Open Highlights Research Collection titled <a href="http://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.2001633">Seven Glimpses into the Emotional Brain</a>, “Cognition – the term that includes mental processes such as attention, memory, problem-solving, planning, and language – stopped being exclusively a philosophical subject approached by introspection and became a matter of empirical investigation and objective quantification.”</p>
<p>One of the articles in this Collection, published in <em>Nature Communications</em> by <a href="http://www.nature.com/articles/ncomms11096">Zhu and authors</a>, explored the mechanisms required for normal development of the amygdala, a brain region highly involved in emotions, fear and memory. In fact, the amygdala must be considered as a sensory hub for the integration of emotional stimuli. Thus, understanding neural circuits underlying emotional and cognitive states is fundamental since dysfunctions of early emotional circuits may lead to neurodevelopmental disorders such as autism and schizophrenia.</p>
<p>Among all the biomolecules able to promote or interfere with emotional and cognitive functions, we know that ephrins and their specific receptors play a major role in modulating brain plasticity and sensory integration. Ephrins are membrane-bound proteins that act as ligands of Eph receptors and have been extensively documented as fundamental for axon guidance. Ephrins have previously been shown to be key actors in cellular phenomena such as axon pruning, synaptogenesis, synaptic and structural plasticity. At the behavioural level, ephrin-B3 (eB3) has also been found to be associated with anxiety disorders and mental retardation.</p>
<p>Using specific gene-targeted mice, Zhu and authors observed that ephrin-B3 is required during a critical period in the neonatal brain for axon targeting and dendritic spine formation in the amygdala and for the development of innate fear. Xiao-Na Zhu, the leading author of this study said, “we found that eB3 deletion leads to a significant defect in innate fear behaviour, which is associated with a disruption in connections of amygdala neurons.”</p>
<p>The authors’ results are in agreement with their hypothesis that eB3 stimulates forward signaling to guide axon targeting for trans-nucleus modulation (from hippocampus to amygdala) and thereby coordinates spinogenesis and neuronal activation in the amygdala. Thus, according to these findings, eB3 may act by allowing pre- and post-synaptic structures interacting and thereby coordinates axon targeting, morphology and neuronal reactions in the amygdala.</p>
<figure class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_19095" style="width: 530px;"><a href="http://blogs.plos.org/neuro/files/2017/01/Zhu-et-al.-2016b-1.jpg"><img alt="Model of timed pre- and post-synaptic coordination for inter-nucleus neuronal connection for defensive neuronal responses.

The mushroom spinogenesis and defensive neuronal activity are disrupted in Efnb3−/− mice (from Zhu et al., 2016)</figure>
<p>Interestingly, eB3 was observed mainly in the hippocampus (a memory-related area) but not in the amygdala (a fear-related area), raising then the question of how eB3 in these structures may initiate molecular reactions to modify amygdala through wired trans-nucleus synapses. “Mechanistically”, propose the authors:“Phosphorylated EphB receptors can regulate GluN1 receptor-dependent influx of calcium, leading to synaptic function-related gene expression which eventually facilitates spine morphogenesis and hence neuronal reactions to aversive cues”.</p>
<p>We know that the brain elicits innate fear-driven responses by integrating sensory stimuli with critical brain nuclei that are involved in the initiation and modulation of amygdala-mediated emotional responses. The authors argue that because aberrant wiring of emotional circuits could lead to neurodevelopmental disorders characterized by socio-emotional impairments, these results could explain why deficiencies in Ephrin-B/EphB signaling have been linked to anxiety disorders and autism.</p>
<p>Of course, further investigations will be necessary to fully uncover the biological substrates by which our brain, especially during development, integrates sensory inputs, computes and elaborates them in order to build up complex behaviors.</p>

<p>Rice is a staple food crop in India and many other places in the world. Knowing how genetically diverse a crop is and the pattern of that diversity is important as it helps in developing suitable breeding strategies.  Indian rice varieties are known to be very genetically diverse.  However, studies have shown that there has been a loss of some of this diversity, particularly as a result of mass crop production (green revolution).  As there had not been a detailed study carried out on this trend, Singh <em>et al</em> decided to do an analysis using <span class="_Tgc">Simple Sequence Repeat (</span>SSR) markers, looking at the genetic trends of a large set of Indian rice varieties (released between 1940-2013) held in the National Gene Bank of India.</p>
<blockquote><p>Rice is a staple food crop in India and many other places in the world. Knowing how genetically diverse a crop is and the pattern of that diversity is important as it helps in developing suitable breeding strategies.</p></blockquote>
<p>Their results showed that between 1940 and 2005, genetic diversity between Indian rice varieties increased, but then began to decrease between the years 2006-2013. They concluded that the recent trait based improvement program resulted in breeders relying too heavily on certain varieties, which in turn caused the loss of gene diversity in Indian rice between 2006-2013.  This suggests that breeders need to increase the genetic diversity of this crop by introducing other varieties of Indian rice into the current breeding program.</p>

<p>Cerebellar cortical degeneration (CCD) is a brain disease for which certain breeds of dog have a genetic predisposition. Typical symptoms include a loss of co-ordination, head tilting and abnomal posturing in the dog. Age of onset and rate of progression of the disease varies between dog breeds. Histopathological findings typically include primary Purkinje neuronal degeneration and death.  The genes responsible for the disease have been identified for several dog breeds, including Old English Sheepdogs, Gordon Setters and Scottish Terriers, allowing for selective breeding to reduce the number of dogs with the condition. Fenn<em> et al</em> published the results of a study looking at the genetic cause of CCD in Hungarian Vizslas.</p>
<figure class="wp-caption alignright" id="attachment_8423" style="width: 310px;"><img alt="dog-1190024_1280" class="wp-image-8423 size-medium" height="225" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2017/01/dog-1190024_1280-300x225.jpg" width="300" /><div class="attachment-image--caption">Pixabay</div><div class="attachment-image--source"></div></figure>
<p>They reported on the case of two puppies from the same litter that had been diagnosed with CCD and euthanized shortly afterwards. Histopathological examination revealed primary Purkinje neuron loss consistent with the condition.  The article then goes on to describe how whole genome sequencing successfully identified a splice donor site mutation in the SNX14 gene, the functions of which include maintaining normal neuronal excitability and synaptic transmission, that likely to be the cause of the disease in Hungarian Vizsla dogs.</p>

<p>One of the main functions of the captive panda population is to ensure that the genetic diversity found in wild giant pandas living in their natural habitats is preserved.  Understanding the genetic contributions from each of the wild panda populations in captive pandas is essential when planning breeding programs to preserve the genetic diversity of the species.</p>
<p>Yang <em>et al</em> investigated the genetic contributions from different wild panda populations to the captive panda populations. They found that this genetic diversity was very unbalanced, with one large wild panda population (Qionglai) accounting for over 50% of the captive panda gene pool.  This is in stark comparison to the 3.6% contributed by the smaller panda population from Xiaoxiangling. The Daxiangling population was shown not to contribute to the genetic composition of the captive population at all.</p>
<blockquote><p>One of the main functions of the captive panda population is to ensure that the genetic diversity found in wild giant pandas living in their natural habitats is preserved.</p></blockquote>
<p>Breeding recommendations to increase the genetic contributions made from one of the smaller wild panda populations  may be at the expense of other similarly sized ones.  With this in mind, Yang <em>et al</em> developed three habitat-controlled breeding plans to increase the genetic contributions from the smallest wild panda populations with little to no representation currently in the captive giant panda population.  Incorporating contributions from these populations into panda breeding programs could increase their genetic representation in the captive panda population in the near future.</p>

<p>Epidermolysis bullosa is a rare inherited skin disease that causes the skin to be very fragile and blister easily. A recent article by Pausch <em>et al</em> described how artificial insemination can cause the spread of the disease in Vorderwald cattle.</p>
<figure class="wp-caption alignleft" id="attachment_8426" style="width: 310px;"><img alt="cow-7442_1920" class="wp-image-8426 size-medium" height="225" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2017/01/cow-7442_1920-300x225.jpg" width="300" /><div class="attachment-image--caption">Pixabay</div><div class="attachment-image--source"></div></figure>
<p>Whole genome haplotype-based tests allowed researchers to identify the locus responsible as the distal end of chromosome 22.  A nonsense mutation in the COL7A1 gene was shown to cause this autosomal recessive disease; the same mutation had previously been found to cause epidermolysis bullosa in Rotes Höhenvieh cattle.</p>
<p>The identification of the mutation now means that carrier animals can be detected and prevented from mating and spreading this painful skin disease.</p>

<p>Imagine the arrival of some high-tech brain device for treating mental health problems. It’s effective for many, but there’s an important side-effect. It changes your personality. Alarm ensues as campaigners warn that users risk being altered fundamentally for years to come. Now replay this scenario but replace the neuro-gizmo with good old-fashioned psychotherapy, and realise this: we’re talking fact, not fiction. <a href="http://psycnet.apa.org/psycinfo/2017-00079-001/">A new meta-analysis in <em>Psychological Bulletin</em></a> has looked at 207 psychotherapy and related studies published between 1959 and 2013, involving over 20,000 participants, with measures of personality taken repeatedly over time. The analysis has found that just a few weeks of therapy is associated with significant and long-lasting changes in clients’ personalities, especially reductions in the trait of Neuroticism and increases in Extraversion.</p>
<p><span id="more-17416"></span></p>
<p>Talk of personality change can sound unsettling because we think of our personalities as reflecting our essential “me-ness”. But from a wellbeing perspective, the trait changes uncovered by this new research are welcome and may even underlie the benefits of therapy. Neuroticism or emotional instability is an especially important risk factor for future poor mental and physical health, and meanwhile high scorers on Extraversion are known to be happier on average and more optimistic.</p>
<p>The authors of the new research, Brent Roberts at the University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign, and his colleagues, also report that personality change appeared to occur remarkably quickly. Roughly four or more weeks of therapy was enough to induce meaningful change. In fact, beyond eight weeks, more therapy was not associated with greater personality change. Therapy-related changes to trait Neuroticism were especially significant – a few weeks of therapy led to about half the amount of increase in emotional stability that you would typically expect to see someone exhibit over an entire lifetime (as a general trend, most of us slowly but surely become more emotionally stable as we get older).</p>
<p>Roberts and his team were particularly interested in whether the therapy-related personality changes they uncovered simply reflected an effect of mood or a genuine change in traits. Consistent with the idea that these were true trait changes, they found that personality change was larger in participants in treatment groups compared with those in control conditions, and that changes were found to last over the course of years without fading.</p>
<p>The researchers also uncovered a small number of “non-clinical” trials that involved healthy participants undertaking cognitive training and other interventions rather than psychotherapy, and that measured personality over time. Here too there was evidence of significant personality change, again arguing against the idea that the effects of psychotherapy on personality merely reflect a return to a non-depressed mood or to one’s natural personality pre-illness. However, Roberts and his team cautioned there were only a few of these non-clinical trials and they tended to be conducted over short time scales, so the question of whether psychotherapy is transforming a client’s personality or “remaking” it to an earlier state remains open for now.</p>
<p>Other details to emerge from the analysis: extent of observed personality change was about the same for different kinds of therapy, for instance be that CBT or psychodynamic (though hospitalisation was associated with the least amount of change); clients diagnosed with depression or personality disorders exhibited the greatest personality change compared with other conditions; and the size of the effects were the same across gender and age. This last finding concerning age is especially intriguing. As the researchers said, it appears to support “the plasticity principle that personality is an open system and amenable to change” through the lifespan.</p>
<p>There are some notable limitations to the new analysis, especially the fact that the studies under review almost entirely relied on clients’ ratings of their own personalities (though the fact that not all traits changed positively in response to therapy argues against a general effect on self-presentation or personality-related self-esteem). The research also leaves unanswered a big question for the future: just <em>how</em> is psychotherapy enacting these personality trait changes?</p>
<p>Cautions noted, this important paper shines a welcome light on a little discussed consequence of psychotherapy, and it feeds into a broader movement in clinical psychology that is recognising the important role of personality in mental health. In the near future we may see the development of therapeutic interventions that more deliberately target personality trait changes, rather than these changes being a kind of side-effect. The research also speaks to an ongoing debate in personality science about just how much personality changes, with the new findings arguing against the idea that change can only ever occur slowly.</p>
<p>“Personality traits are not only robust predictors of important life outcomes, but also appear amenable to intervention,” Roberts and his team concluded. “This fact opens the door to a new era of research that more strongly links personality and clinical psychology, and other groups, such as educational psychologists and economists, who are interested in changing people and their behaviours in order to help them with their lives.”</p>

 Accurate genome inheritance by daughter cells requires that sister chromatids in the mother attach to microtubules emanating from opposite poles of the mitotic spindle (bi-orientation). A surveillance mechanism named the spindle assembly checkpoint (SAC) monitors the microtubule attachment process, temporarily halting sister chromatid separation and mitotic exit until completion of bi-orientation1. SAC failure results in abnormal chromosome numbers (aneuploidy), a hallmark of many tumours. The HORMA domain protein MAD2 is a subunit of the SAC effector mitotic checkpoint complex (MCC). Structural conversion from open to closed MAD2 is required for MAD2 incorporation in MCC1. In vitro, MAD2 conversion and MCC assembly requires several hours2–4, while the SAC response in cells is established in a few minutes5–7. To address this discrepancy, we reconstituted with purified components a near-complete SAC signalling system and monitored MCC assembly with real-time sensors. Dramatic acceleration of MAD2 conversion and MCC assembly was observed when MPS1 phosphorylated the MAD1:MAD2 complex, triggering its template function in the MAD2 conversion and contributing to the establishment of a physical platform for MCC assembly. Thus, catalytic activation of the SAC depends on regulated protein-protein interactions that accelerate the spontaneous but rate-limiting conversion of MAD2 required for MCC assembly.

            <p>Automated testing is a paramount activity in agile development. Tests act as a guard to catch and localize software defects early. Production code relies on automated tests, however tests do not often have the luxury to be automatically checked by someone or something else. Therefore, high quality tests should be at place to ensure tests are doing a good job. There are many aspects to test quality, such as test effectiveness, test maintainability, etc. Usually, deviations from practices considered as good may lead to code smells, which in test code we call test-smells. Much empirical work has already been channelled through measuring the effectiveness of tests, however there is a lack of empirical evidence for the impact of test-smells on test quality. In this talk I will be focused on giving a brief introduction to software testing, and its importance. I will then explain the practices for writing good tests, and discuss the implications when these good practices are not met.</p>

<p>Understanding jokes requires a certain amount of mental agility, psychologists tell us, because you need to recognise a sudden shift in meaning, or appreciate the blending of odd contexts that don’t normally go together. A <a href="http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10339-016-0789-y">new study</a> in the journal <em>Cognitive Processing</em> has tested whether intelligence plays the same role in the appreciation of sick or black humour: the kind of jokes that make light of death, illness and the vulnerable. Consistent with past research linking intelligence with joke appreciation, the participants who most liked cartoons based on black humour also scored highest on verbal and non-verbal IQ.</p>
<p><span id="more-17342"></span></p>
<p>Fourteen researchers, led by <a href="http://www.psychologie-in-wien.at/ueber-uns/univprofdrmag-ulrike-willinger/">Ulrike Willinger</a> at the Medical University of Vienna, asked 156 participants, with an average age of 33 and including 76 women, to rate their comprehension and enjoyment of 12 black humour cartoons taken from <em>The Black Book</em> by Uli Stein. For instance, one cartoon depicted a confused man holding a public telephone, the voice coming from the phone saying: “Here is the answering machine of the self-help association for Alzheimer patients. If you still remember your topic, please speak after the tone.” The participants also completed basic tests of their verbal and non-verbal IQ and answered questions about their mood, aggressive tendencies and educational background.</p>
<p>The researchers identified three distinct groups of participants based on their understanding and appreciation for the sick cartoons (incidentally, age and gender appeared not to be relevant factors). One group showed the highest sick humour appreciation and comprehension, and they also scored the highest on verbal and non-verbal IQ, were better educated, and scored lower for aggression and bad mood. This fits with past research showing that sense of humour correlates with IQ, but refutes the somewhat commonly held belief that people who like black humour tend to be grumpy and perhaps a little prone to sadism.</p>
<p>A second group showed moderate comprehension and the lowest sick joke enjoyment. These people had average intelligence scores, but showed the most negative mood and the highest aggression. So perhaps opposite to what you might expect, this research found no evidence that grumpy, aggressive people enjoy sick or black humour. Meanwhile, the final group showed moderate sick humour comprehension and preference, and they had average intelligence scores, generally positive mood and moderate aggression scores.</p>
<p>Willinger and her team said their findings suggested black humour processing is a “complex information-processing task”, and were consistent with past research suggesting that low mood impairs humour appreciation, this seeming to be true even in the case of sick jokes.

<p>Chemotherapy during the later stages of pregnancy is generally thought to have no significant detrimental effect on fetal development. As a woman’s reproductive lifespan is determined before birth, it is important to understand the effects of chemotherapy on the ovaries of the developing female fetus.</p>
<figure class="wp-caption alignright" id="attachment_8411" style="width: 209px;"><img alt="Wikimedia, cc" class="wp-image-8411 size-medium" height="300" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2017/01/598px-Maternity_Curves-199x300.jpg" width="199" /><div class="attachment-image--caption">Wikimedia, cc</div><div class="attachment-image--source"></div></figure>
<p>Female egg cells develop from germ cells, which are enclosed within ovarian follicles. Follicle development begins 17 weeks into the pregnancy and is not complete until birth. Researchers used a novel <em>in vitro</em> method of mouse cell culture to investigate the effects of etoposide, an anti-cancer drug, on ovarian development.</p>
<p>It was found that prior to follicle formation, presence of etoposide reduced both follicle production and follicle health. After the complete development of the follicle, etoposide had little effect on follicle health and numbers. Albeit preliminary, these findings suggest that exposure to etoposide could have long term effects on the future fertility of the female fetus, potentially reducing the fertility window and likelihood of conception.</p>

<p>Anchoring molecules which bind phagocytic receptors to the cell surface of tumors enables the immune system to recognize, and attack, tumor cells. This effect can be further optimized by applying LPS, a TLR-4 agonist which is toxic to humans, to the tumor cell surface. <a href="https://bmccancer.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12885-016-2982-x">Caisovà and colleagues present a study</a> conducted to optimize this therapy for human treatment.</p>
<p>A mouse-model which had been transplanted with B16-F10 melanoma cells was used to test several combinations of TLR agonists and phagocytosis-stimulating ligands, to find the most effective treatment with low toxicity to humans.</p>
<p>Of all the combinations studied, it was found that R-848 and covalently anchored mannan-SMCC had the best therapeutic effect, reducing tumor size <em>in vivo</em>. The addition of heat-killed <em>Listeria monocytogenes</em> further increased mouse survival rate to 83.3%. Furthermore, binding of poly(I:C) to tumor cells protected against re-transplantation with no pathological symptoms observed for over a year after treatment.</p>

<p>Mesothelioma is a malignancy of the lung mesothelium cells usually associated with asbestos exposure. Upon diagnosis, treatment options are limited and the prognosis is generally poor. <a href="http://bmccancer.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12885-016-2106-7">Morgan et al.</a> identify <em>HOX</em> genes as potential therapeutic target in primary mesothelioma tumors.</p>

<p>In some malignant cells, <em>HOX</em> genes become dysregulated, increasing cell proliferation. It was shown that treating mesothelioma-derived cell lines with HXR9, a peptide antagonist of HOX protein, leads to tumor cell death (apoptosis) whilst leaving healthy cells intact. Next, HXR9 treatment was tested in mice with mesothelioma. A significant inhibition of the tumor growth was observed, implying that <em>HOX</em> genes may be an important therapeutic target in mesothelioma therapy.</p>

<p>The FC Prostate Community Trial (FCPC) – a randomized, controlled, parallel-group trial currently being conducted in Denmark – aims to determine the effects of recreational football on rehabilitation in men who have been diagnosed with prostate cancer.</p>
<p>Previously, exercise has been shown to improve disease-specific quality of life and reduce treatment-related toxicity in prostate cancer patients. This study investigates the effect of 1 hour of recreational football training sessions twice weekly on cancer-specific quality of life, lean body mass, fat mass, bone mineral density and content, and well-being. The trial is currently ongoing and is expected to be completed in November 2017.</p>

<p>Different drugs elicit a different response depending on the patient; understanding the reasons for this may not only improve treatment, but the development of future anti-cancer drugs. Tailoring treatment to the individual ensures the optimum patient response, reducing disease progression and drug toxicity. Currently, using biomarkers to tailor cancer therapy focuses on the prognosis and prediction of disease.</p>
<p><a href="http://bmccancer.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12885-016-2886-9">A review by Shahil Amin and Oliver Bathe</a> discusses the potential of using biomarkers in an alternative way, to assess a patients’ response to treatment. The authors explore the implications of treatment response biomarkers which, they argue, may not only benefit individual patients, by minimizing exposure to drugs which may be ineffective or toxic, but could also revolutionize how drugs are developed and clinical trials are conducted.</p>

<p>A meta-analysis and systematic review by Zhao et al. identifies a significant dose-response relationship between alcohol intake and risk of developing prostate cancer. The study aimed to reduce misclassification error, which occurs when participants who are defined as non-drinkers may have consumed alcohol regularly in the past. The study showed that when misclassification error is eliminated, there is a significant increase in prostate cancer risk in low-moderate drinkers when compared to those who abstain from alcohol.</p>
<figure class="wp-caption alignleft" id="attachment_8415" style="width: 210px;"><img alt="dilettantiquity, Flickr, cc." class="size-medium wp-image-8415" height="300" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2017/01/3434492702_d3bc6ef921_o-200x300.jpg" width="200" /><div class="attachment-image--caption">dilettantiquity, Flickr, cc.</div><div class="attachment-image--source"></div></figure>
<p>In studies with no misclassification error, an alcohol consumption of 1.3-24mg per day may increase prostate cancer risk by as much as 24%. This presents an increase in 16% when compared to studies which include former drinkers in the abstinence group. As well as providing important data regarding the long term effects low alcohol consumption has on health, this study highlights the effect misclassification errors can have on data.</p>

<p>British workers spend on average one hour commuting each day, and 57 per cent of commuters make their daily journeys by car. But this is a part of our lives we don’t talk much about, beyond the odd epithet about the traffic; maybe because it’s a strange time, betwixt home and work but not fully either. Potentially, the drive to work is a haven: I recall my mother’s glove compartment crammed with audio books, so she could enjoy those stretches of solo time. But it’s more liable to be caught in a crossfire of worries, fretting about Daniel’s pensive moods at the breakfast table, or anticipating criticisms about the last sales pitch. <a href="http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/1359432X.2016.1228628">New research</a> from the University of Haifa suggests these psychological stressors can make our time on the road not just unpleasant, but dangerous as well.</p>
<p><span id="more-17175"></span></p>
<p>Keren Turgeman-Lupo and Michal Biron collected data from 216 employees at a manufacturing organisation (average age 35, with an average driving commute of 16 miles). They surveyed the employees about what they believed was generally seen as acceptable behaviour when on the road, such as whether it is okay to receive phone calls or texts or to let your attention wander to non-driving concerns. Participants also reported how often they committed dangerous driving behaviours such as overtaking on the inside lane or driving too close to the vehicle ahead. Participants who believed less safe driving-related habits were normal and acceptable also tended to drive more dangerously. But what shaped the commuters’ beliefs?</p>
<p>Turgeman-Lupo and Biron found two types of psychological stress had an influence. The first was the degree of conflict workers said they experienced between their family life and the workplace. Higher work-family conflict was associated with more dangerous driving, and this seemed to be explained through its link to participants’ beliefs about what kinds of driving-related behaviours are acceptable. The commute is a liminal period between home and work, such that thoughts and preoccupations may become especially salient, disrupting attention or even leading commuters to fix things by trying to solve domestic situations through messages or calls.</p>
<p>The other relevant stress factor was supervisor abuse. We know that being given a hard time by a manager impairs attention at work, so these preoccupations could also spill over to the commute. Moreover, evidence suggests that one pernicious effect of supervisor abuse is making people feel that they have to ingratiate themselves to avoid further punishment, which could encourage deliberately diverting their attention towards work issues while working, just to get ahead. As with work-life conflict, participants who reported higher levels of supervisor abuse, such as “my supervisor breaks promises he/she makes” admitted to more dangerous driving thanks to their beliefs about what kind of driving-related habits are normal.</p>
<p>Work-related stress can kill us slowly, but this research warns us of one way it can kill quickly, by siphoning away the mental resources that we need to safely steer tons of metal and glass, at high speeds, through a rapidly shifting landscape. It’s another reason why it’s so important for organisations to have humane management practices, liveable demands on worker time, and procedures to eliminate bullying. And it suggests another role organisations can take: to educate their workforce on safe commuting norms and emphasise their importance. Work should wait for the workplace; leave the commute in peace.</p>
