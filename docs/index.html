<p><em>By</em> <a href="http://www.jessesingal.com/">Jesse Singal</a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Stereotype threat is a very evocative, disturbing idea: Imagine if simply being reminded that you are a member of a disadvantaged group, and that stereotypes hold that members of your group are bad at certain tasks, led to a self-fulfilling prophecy in which </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">you</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> performed worse on such tasks than you would otherwise.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That’s been the claim of stereotype threat researchers since the concept was first introduced in the mid-1990s, and it’s spread far and wide. But as seems to be the case with so many strong psychological claims of late, in recent years the picture has gotten a bit murkier. “</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">A </span><a href="http://www.annualreviews.org/doi/full/10.1146/annurev-psych-073115-103235"><span style="font-weight: 400;">recent review</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> suggested that stereotype threat has a robust but small-to-medium sized effect on performance,” </span><a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2017/10/19/reverse-stereotype-threat-women-play-chess-better-than-expected-against-men/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">wrote Alex Fradera here at the BPS Research Digest in 2017</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, “but a </span><a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022440514000831"><span style="font-weight: 400;">meta-analysis</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> suggests that publication bias may be a problem in this literature, inflating the apparent size of the effect.” Adding to the confusion are some results which seem to run exactly </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">opposite</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to what the theory would suspect, like the one Fradera was reporting on: In that study, female chess players were found to have performed better, not worse, against male opponents, which isn’t what the theory would have predicted.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now, another study is poised to complicate things yet further. In a paper to be published in the </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">European Journal of Social Psychology</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and </span><a href="https://psyarxiv.com/v92wk/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">available as a preprint</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a team led by Charlotte Pennington of UWE Bristol recruited female participants to test two mechanisms (reduced effort and working memory disruption) that have been offered to explain the supposed adverse performance effects of gender-related stereotype threat. They also compared different ways of inducing stereotype threat. Interesting questions, you might think, but in all cases the researchers came up empty.</span></p>
<p><span id="more-35934"></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pennington and her colleagues’ study consisted of a pair of experiments in which they asked women to complete eye-tracking (both experiments) tasks, intended to test their inhibitory control, and a mental-arithmetic task (the second experiment only) designed to test their working memory. The participants were split into groups and, prior to their completion of the task, given various stereotype reminders — some, for example, were informed that some research shows “that gender differences exist on visuospatial and mathematical tasks,” and that “females are shown to perform less accurately compared to males.” These reminders were used to provoke two different kinds of stereotype threat – one was “group-as-target”  designed to induce a fear that one’s own performance may be used justify stereotypes about women’s inferior performance; the other, a “self-as-target” threat, involved mentioning that women typically perform worse on the task than men, but with the focus of the results supposedly on their own personal ability. In the second experiment, a group was exposed to a positive stereotype claim, to see if that would improve performance, and in both experiments, a control group wasn’t exposed to any stereotype-laden messaging at all.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The results of both experiments are easy to sum up: Pennington and her colleagues detected no differences between the groups on the key measures they were testing, either in terms of reduced effort or signs of working memory interference. Simply put, neither experiment provided any evidence for a stereotype effect in this setting, let alone revealing anything about the possible mechanisms or contrasting effects of group- or self-threats. Of course, plenty of other studies </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">have</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> provided evidence for such effects. It’s complicated.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One paragraph in Pennington et al’s paper shows just </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">how</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> complicated:</span></p>
<blockquote><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Research has revealed many factors that heighten individuals’ susceptibility to stereotype threat. From a methodological viewpoint, performance decrements are more likely to occur under stereotype threat when the task is difficult … However, a recent meta-analysis casts doubt on task difficulty as a significant moderator of stereotype threat … It is also proposed that stereotype threat effects are more likely to emerge when individuals attribute worth to their social group membership (i.e., group identification…), endorse the stereotype to be accurate (i.e., stereotype endorsement…), and identify strongly with the stereotyped domain … Nguyen and Ryan (2008) report in their meta-analytic review, however, that women with moderate relative to high domain identification are more affected by gender-maths stereotypes, with research further suggesting that individuals do not need to identify with the stereotyped domain or group to experience stereotype threat .… The complexity of these observed findings has led some scholars to theorise that individuals may experience unique forms of stereotype threat, which are moderated by different factors and underpinned by diverse mechanisms … [References, removed here for ease of reading, can be found in the <a href="https://psyarxiv.com/v92wk/">preprint</a>].</span></p></blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If what all these messy, sometimes contradictory findings suggest is true, and stereotype threat, to the extent it has an effect, is moderated by factors like explicit endorsement (or not) of the stereotype in question, or domain identification (or not), and so on – then who is to say we’ve come close to figuring out </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">all</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the possible moderators? At a certain point, the simple storyline that caused the concept to spread so virally in the first place just doesn’t quite hold anymore. It’s not “You will be affected by X,” but rather, “You might be affected by X, depending on A, B, and C.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That’s the nature of good science, of course: We hone in on the truth by figuring out the complicated ways a given phenomenon works. But sometimes this process is at odds with science </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">communication</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and can lead to preemptive, oversimplification popularisation and application. If stereotype threat is so complicated that “individuals may experience unique forms of” it, then what are we left with, exactly?</span></p>

<p><a href="http://www.un.org/en/events/humanrightsday/">Human Rights Day</a>  is held on the 10<sup>th</sup> December, the date that the United Nations General Assembly adopted the <a href="http://www.un.org/en/universal-declaration-human-rights/">Universal Declaration of Human Rights</a>. To mark this occasion, Professor Siroos Mirzaei, an Associate Editor for <em>BMC International Health and Human rights</em>  and Head of the Department of Nuclear Medicine of the Wilhelminen Hospital in Vienna, with Professor Thomas Wenzel, an Associate Professor from the Medical University of Vienna, were invited to write a blog post on the role that physicians play in upholding human rights and the dangers associated with this.</p>
<img alt="" class=" wp-image-10752 alignleft" height="255" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2019/01/human-resources-2724191_1280-300x300.png" width="255" />
<p>The authors explain that physicians are often faced with a variety of different ethical and human right issues. Examples include being requested to violate ethical standards in so called <a href="https://www.bmj.com/content/350/bmj.h589.long">“dual obligations”</a> situations, such as being involved in the planning and observation of torturing prisoners. Physicians can also find themselves at <a href="http://persian2english.com/?p=16713">serious risk</a> for upholding legal and ethical standards. Mirzaei and Wenzel then conclude the blog post by discussing the barrage of new ethical challenges that physicals may face, linked, for example, to medical technology or <a href="https://bmcmedethics.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1472-6939-15-24">health related aspects of conflicts</a>.</p>

<p>A new article, published as part of the ongoing <a href="https://bmchealthservres.biomedcentral.com/hsroud">Health Services Research for Opioid Use Disorders</a> thematic series in <em>BMC Health Services Research,</em> investigates different opioid treatment policies in the USA and how these variations may affect opioid-related hospital readmissions in different states</p>
<p>Such policies include, for example, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Good_Samaritan_law">Good Samaritan laws</a>, the availability of naloxone to reverse the effects of an overdose or the provision of medication-assisted treatment for opioid dependence. Blanchard <em>et al</em> conducted a study to assess whether such state opioid treatment policies had an effect on 90-day opioid-related hospital readmissions.</p>
<p>Differences in index hospitalization rates suggest that states with opioid treatment policies had a higher level of need for opioid-related intervention; this may be a factor in the higher rates of hospital readmission in these states. This, in turn, also suggests that more research is needed to understand what various opioid treatment policies can be most effective in reducing hospital readmission rates.</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemotherapy-induced_peripheral_neuropathy">Chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy</a> (CIPN) is a progressive condition experienced by up to 40% of cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy. Symptoms include numbness, tingling and sensitivity to cold in the hands and feet and sometimes in the arms and legs. It can cause sufferers to lose function of the affected limbs.  Diagnosing and treating CIPN quickly may prevent this loss of physical function.</p>
<blockquote><p>Chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN) is a progressive condition experienced by up to 40% of cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy.</p></blockquote>
<p>Knoerl <em>et al</em> recently published the results of a trial whereby self-reported physical function in cancer patients undergoing neurotoxic chemotherapy (chemotherapy known to cause CIPN) is assessed via a newly developed Electronic Symptom Assessment-Cancer (ESRA-C) intervention.  The article reports that the patients experienced significantly less reduction in physical functioning when reporting their symptoms in this way.</p>

<p>Studies have suggested that caregivers can be vulnerable to psychological distress (for example, depression), particularly women. An article has recently been published in <em>BMC Women’s Health</em> that investigates the relationship between caregiving (proving unpaid care to someone who has physical, psychological or developmental needs) and depression amongst Baby Boomer women, using surveys distributed to women from nineteen different countries.</p>
<blockquote><p>Baby Boomer women living in countries where a higher proportion of their peers are expected to be in managerial/professional employment and living in countries where women are often in vulnerable employment were found to be at greater risk of displaying symptoms of depression</p></blockquote>
<p>The term “Baby Boomer” refers to people born between 1946 and 1964. This group of people benefited from the global revival after World War II, with many becoming more highly educated than the previous generation and therefore more likely to be employed in professional and managerial occupations.  Baby Boomer women living in countries where a higher proportion of their peers are expected to be in managerial/professional employment and living in countries where women are often in vulnerable employment were found to be at greater risk of displaying symptoms of depression.  These findings suggest that the risk of depression amongst Baby Boomer women in a caregiving role is dependent in some degree upon social context and structure and that promoting mental health for this group should therefore be tailored to their situation.</p>

<p>Well, I’ve decided to reboot my website with a broader scope and post more often. It’s been awhile and furthermore, most of my previous posts were very technical and specific. I’ve often considered writing posts that could be appreciated by a broader subset of folks and now that time has come.</p>
<p>Inspired by a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cnooCepNZv4" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Ted Talk about liminality by Marianne Cantwell</a>, I’ve rebranded my site with a wider scope. I’ve always had a soft spot for STEM fields, especially science, so – to borrow Ms. Cantwell’s analogy – I’m assigning my home “continent” to science/research/academia. As this experiment progresses, I am hoping to add to my “island” from the arts, computing, social issues, and human relations. Being a bit shy, I am nervous about exploring beyond STEM but also excited to liven up this blog a bit. Stay tuned for more!</p>

<p><i>By</i> <a href="https://emmayoung.net/">Emma Young</a></p>
<p>Around 30 per cent of British children fail to meet expected targets in reading or maths at age 11. These children face a future of continuing difficulties in education, as well as poorer mental health and employment success. Understanding why some kids struggle – and providing them with tailored support as early as possible – is clearly vital. Some will be diagnosed with a specific disorder, such as Attention Deficient Hyperactivity Disorder or dyslexia, and get targeted help. But many will not. And even many conventional diagnostic labels may be misleading, and fail to capture the true picture of a child’s problems, according to new work by a team at the MRC Cognition and Brain Sciences Unit at the University of Cambridge, which has come up with a radical, alternative approach.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><span id="more-35933"></span></p>
<p>Duncan Astle and his colleagues studied 520 children aged between 5 and 18 years (average age 9) who had been referred to a research clinic at the unit for problems with attention, memory, language or poor school progress in reading or maths. Setting aside these diagnoses, they gave all the children a battery of assessments of their cognitive and learning performance, which included measures of working memory, phonological processing, spelling, reading, and maths. Their communication skills were measured using a separate checklist. A parent or carer also completed behavioural assessments of each child – reporting on their impulse control and emotional regulation, for example. The team then fed the cognitive and learning results for each child into an artificial neural network, which looked for any patterns in the data, grouping kids with distinct similarities into clusters.</p>
<p>One hundred and eighty-four of these children also had MRI brain scans – as did 36 typically performing children, for comparison – allowing the researchers to look for any group differences in patterns of communication between brain regions. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>As reported in <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/desc.12747">their open-access paper</a> in <em>Developmental Science</em>, according to the artificial neural network analysis, the children fell into four distinct groups. But these bore no relationship to their previous diagnoses. As the researchers write, “children referred primarily for problems with attention, poor learning or memory were equally likely to be assigned to each group”. This finding is worth stressing. The conventional diagnostic labels already given to the children did not<i> </i>reflect their cognitive profiles identified by the thorough testing in this study: “The four groups cut across any traditional diagnostic groupings that existed within the data,” the researchers wrote. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>So what did characterise these groups?<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>More than half of the children in the sample fell into two extremes. Those in the “age appropriate” group in fact scored typically for their age on the cognitive tests; they did not have learning difficulties. But they did have an elevated level of behavioural difficulties, which presumably accounted for their problems in school. Meanwhile, members of the “broad cognitive deficits” group had widespread and severe cognitive problems, scoring in the bottom 5 per cent of the population on measures of spelling, reading and maths, and also experiencing difficulties with communication.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>“Generalised cognitive deficits therefore appear to constrain multiple aspects of learning,” the authors note. Relative to the other groups, kids in this group also showed reduced connectivity between some specific areas of the brain that have previously been identified as playing a role in multiple higher-order cognitive skills (such as problem-solving). “These general struggling learners are rarely studied, but our data suggest that they are common amongst those coming to the attention of children’s specialist services,” the researchers write.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Children in the other two groups scored in between the two extremes, overall – but they also showed some specific deficits.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>One group was particularly poor at phonological processing – processing sounds in words – and verbal short-term and working memory. As might be expected, these children had trouble with speech, syntax and general coherence. And the brain imaging data showed reduced connectivity between regions implicated in language processing, supporting the AI analysis. However, these children were also poor at maths, which was unexpected. Though impaired phonological processing is typically associated with problems with reading, this data suggests that it’s likely to indicate more general learning deficits.</p>
<p>Members of the fourth group had distinct difficulties in working memory, scoring significantly below average on spatial, short-term memory and on verbal and spatial working memory. (There was no obvious differences in the brain connectivity patterns of these children.)<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>One of the striking findings is that though the two intermediate groups had different specific deficits, their performance at maths and reading were almost identical. This contrasts with earlier research linking phonological problems to reading difficulties (dyslexia) and spatial short-term and working memory problems with trouble with maths (dyscalculia). This may be because previous studies have tended to recruit kids with these specific deficits – i.e. reading but not numeracy problems, for example. According to the new results, such specific learning problems may in fact be relatively rare in the general population of struggling learners (which chimes with <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2018/09/18/uk-study-finds-children-with-maths-difficulties-sldm-dyscalculia-are-100-times-less-likely-to-receive-an-official-diagnosis-than-peers-with-dyslexia/">a recent study</a> of dyscalculia prevalence that found most children with dyscalculia also had language problems).</p>
<p>The researchers do acknowledge a few imitations with the study. For example, as a total of only 220 children were included in the neuro-imaging comparison portion of the research, only the largest and most consistent group differences are likely to have been revealed. (Which could explain why the team did not observe brain communication differences in a few of the groups.)<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>But there are clearly potentially important insights here. <i>If</i>, as this work suggests, children can<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>struggle with maths and reading for very different reasons, which do not necessarily align with diagnoses made in the conventional way, then surely the diagnosis and referral process has to be looked at – and the interventions that might help these children will surely have to be differently tailored, too.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

                <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/~r/plos/Blog/~3/zSQJ7GGxpys/">PLOS Board Appointments</a></h4>

<img alt="" class="webfeedsFeaturedVisual wp-post-image" height="150" src="http://blogs.plos.org/plos/files/2015/10/12-690x320-150x150.jpg" style="display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;" width="150" /><div class="wp_orcid_field"><a href="http://orcid.org/0000-0002-7455-4909" rel="author" target="_blank">0000-0002-7455-4909</a></div><p> </p>
<p>After a careful search and much consideration, we are excited to share with our community five new appointments we’ve made to the <a href="https://www.plos.org/people">PLOS Board</a>. This is a pivotal time for PLOS, and as you’ll see, each member will bring us a different perspective, which will enable us to expand the ways in which we serve our scientific communities.</p>
<p>Our new Board Chair is <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/alastairadam/">Alastair Adam</a>, currently Co-CEO of innovative digital textbook publisher, <a href="https://catalog.flatworldknowledge.com/">FlatWorld</a>, who brings to the role not only a strong understanding of publishing – including scientific journals – but also his business savvy and strategic skills. Alastair joined the Board effective November 1 and assumed the Chair role on January 1, 2019, replacing our longtime Board Chair, Gary Ward (more on Gary a little later).</p>
<p>We also added <a href="http://psychology.ucdavis.edu/people/svazire">Dr. Simine Vazire</a>, who is currently a Professor in the Department of Psychology at UC Davis where <a href="http://psychology.ucdavis.edu/directory-of-people/featured-faculty/simine-vazire-studying-self-knowledge">her research</a> focuses on one of the oldest and most fundamental questions in psychology: how do we know ourselves? In 2017, she was awarded a <a href="https://www.bitss.org/lr-prizes/">Leamer-Rosenthal Prize</a> for Open Social Science in recognition of her efforts to advance reproducibility, openness and credibility in the social sciences. She held a previous role as a senior editor of <em>Collabra: Psychology</em> and Editor-in-Chief of <em>Social Psychological and Personality Science</em>. Her scientific and editorial expertise bring a well-rounded and diverse perspective to our Board, and will help to ensure that working scientists retain a strong voice on our Board.</p>
<p><a href="https://wikimediafoundation.org/profile/victoria-coleman/">Dr. Victoria Coleman</a> joined the Board in May 2018. She is currently the Chief Technology Officer at the Wikimedia Foundation where she sets the organization’s technical roadmap for the evolution, development, and delivery of core platforms and architecture.  Victoria brings valuable technology experience to the Board at a time when PLOS, like many mid-size publishers, faces important and difficult choices about its technology infrastructure. Victoria serves in several advisory roles including the Board of the Santa Clara University Department of Computer Engineering and as Senior Advisor to the Director of the University of California Berkeley’s Center for Information Technology Research in the Interest of Society.</p>
<p>We also wanted to ensure that we maintain deep experience in PLOS’ core biomedical science fields, and we are very lucky to have Professor <a href="https://chancellor.ucsf.edu/campus-leadership/executive-cabinet/keith-yamamoto-phd">Keith Yamamoto</a> of UCSF agree to join us (effective February 1, 2019). Keith is both a highly regarded scientist running his own research lab and has extraordinary experience in the policy arena focusing much of his career on science practice, education, communication, and advocacy including strong and early support for OA. He currently serves as UCSF’s first vice chancellor for Science Policy and Strategy.</p>
<p>Last but by no means least, <a href="https://hewlett.org/people/suresh-bhat/">Suresh Bhat</a> joined us on November 1, 2018 as incoming Chair of the Finance Committee. Suresh brings to PLOS not only deep financial knowledge but also experience at a top research university and a passion for education. Suresh has headed finance programs for a number of financial institutions. He is currently CFO and Treasurer at the <a href="https://hewlett.org/">Hewlett Foundation</a>, prior to that, he was CFO at the Haas School of Business at UC Berkeley (and is a Haas and Cal alum).</p>
<p>I would be remiss if I did not take the opportunity here to express my heartfelt thanks to both Gary Ward, our now former Board Chair, and Mike Eisen, one of the co-founders of PLOS, both of whom left the Board in 2018.  In his seven years as Board Chair, Gary has led the Board with passion, wisdom and integrity, and has been both counsel and friend to many of us in the organization. Mike is of course irreplaceable in every way. His vision, zeal and dedication are a big reason that PLOS not only exists but has had such a deep impact on scientific communication. I have no doubt that Mike will continue to be one of PLOS’ greatest advocates (and yes, let us know when we get it wrong – as good friends do!).</p>
<p>While goodbyes are never easy, we are excited to embark on this new chapter for PLOS with the fresh wisdom of so many exceptional, dedicated individuals. Please join us in welcoming our new Board members!</p>

The authors of an much-ballyhooed 2017 paper about the spread of fake news on social media have retracted their article after finding that they’d botched their analysis. The paper, “Limited individual attention and online virality of low-quality information,” presented an argument for why bogus facts seem to gain so much traction on sites such as … <a class="more-link" href="http://retractionwatch.com/2019/01/09/oft-quoted-paper-on-spread-of-fake-news-turns-out-to-befake-news/">Continue reading <span class="screen-reader-text">Oft-quoted paper on spread of fake news turns out to be…fake news</span></a>

<p>You might imagine – as prior research suggests many people do – that putting your feelings into words will only intensify them. In fact, many laboratory studies have found the opposite to be true. Stating out loud, or writing down, what you are feeling – a process that psychologists call “affect labelling” – seems to down-regulate emotions, diminishing their intensity.</p>
<p>Now an intriguing study has explored this phenomenon outside of the lab, analysing over a billion tweets to find examples of when people used a tweet to put their emotional state into words. From analysing the emotional language used in preceding and subsequent tweets, <a href="http://zhaojichang.cn/~fanrui/">Rui Fan</a> and his colleagues were able to see how the act of affect labelling influenced the course of an emotional state. “We found that, for a majority of individuals, emotional intensity decreased rapidly after their explicit expression in an ‘I feel’ statement,” the researchers write in <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41562-018-0490-5">their paper in <em>Nature Human Behaviour</em></a>.</p>
<p><span id="more-35920"></span></p>
<p>Fan and his team identified over 42,000 English language tweets in which an individual had stated they were feeling a positive emotion (for example, writing “I feel happy” or “I feel awesome”) and another 67,000-plus in which an individual had stated they were experiencing a negative emotion (for example, writing “I feel sad” or “I feel terrible”).</p>
<p>Next, they used an established algorithm to analyse the emotional language content of any tweets written in the 6 hours prior to the affect labelling tweet, and 6 hours afterwards (the algorithm uses over 7,000 commonly used English words previously scored by human raters in terms of their relative positivity or negativity). The emotional language scores provided by the algorithm allowed the researchers to chart the intensity of the Twitter users’ emotions prior to and after they had explicitly labelled how they were feeling.</p>
<p>The picture that emerged was that both positive and negative emotions began ramping up prior to an act of affect labelling (captured in the “I feel …” tweet) and then rapidly calmed afterwards. On average, the positive emotional experiences were longer lasting than negative (94 versus 85 minutes). Also, the ramping up and subsequent calming of positive emotions was symmetrical around the peak that coincided with the “I feel …” affect labelling tweet. In contrast, the build up of negative emotions was longer and more gradual prior to the relevant “I feel …” tweet, followed by a faster decline to baseline levels.</p>
<p>Comparing between the genders, there was a suggestion that the calming power of affect labelling was more striking for women than men, especially for negative emotions.</p>
<p>The researchers acknowledged their approach has its drawbacks – for instance, to what extent are people’s emotional expressions on social media a performance rather than a true reading of their emotional state? It’s possible too that the findings would vary in other languages or cultures. Also, while analysing vast quantities of data gathered from social media offers many advantages (such as large sample sizes and real-life data), there is a loss of experimental control, and experts often disagree about the meaning of the data and how best to interpret it (see <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2018/04/23/are-tweets-a-goldmine-for-psychologists-or-just-a-lot-of-noise-researchers-clash-over-the-meaning-of-social-media-data/">here</a> for an example in a different context). It’s notable that in the current study there was no comparison with how positive and negative emotional states unfold in the absence of affect labelling (i.e. what, in an experimental set-up, would be the control condition).</p>
<p>These issues aside, in <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41562-018-0487-0">an accompanying commentary</a> on the new research, Matthew Lieberman – a leading research on affect labelling – describes the findings as “remarkable”. He adds: “The authors took a creative approach to studying affect labelling out in the real world and produced some of the strongest and most comprehensive data in support of the role of affect labelling in dampening affective intensity.”</p>
<p>All of which raises an obvious but relatively unexplored question – why does putting our feelings into words lead to a dampening of those feelings? Hopefully future studies will address the relevant mechanisms, which Lieberman (in <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/1754073917742706">a recent review</a>) suggests could include a distracting effect, a reduction of uncertainty, and/or something to do with “symbolic conversion” – the distance and closure created by translating emotions into words.</p>

<img alt="" class="attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image" height="110" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2018/09/data2-140x110.jpg" style="display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;" width="140" /><p><strong>Tell us a bit about your career as a scientist and Professor and what a typical day looks like for you. What is the most rewarding part of your role?</strong></p>
<p>As a scientist and a professor, my typical day is focused on teaching the younger generation of engineering students and expanding on my own research. I teach both undergraduate and graduate students in bioengineering as well as guide the students at my lab, aiming to help them improve their research and methodology skills, and their general understanding of bioengineering.</p>
<p>Concurrently, I communicate with different researchers and industrial leaders to perform innovative and collaborative research and to pioneer new technological advancements for the benefit of cancer patients. I hope to one day be able to aid these people in their battles with this illness.</p>
<p>The most satisfactory aspect of my role is the notion that my research and teaching will one day aid the future generation of engineers, fulfil their potential and dreams in this field and ultimately bring societal progress.</p>
<p><strong>What is it like being a woman in your field? Have you ever had any difficulties in your career due to your gender?</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>I strongly suggest that young women engineers are ambitious and actively seek out opportunities that can support their career development and fully grasp everything that is available to them.</p></blockquote>
<p>In Korea, it can be difficult to be a woman as an engineer in any of the engineering fields. In fact, the majority of the discipline is heavily outnumbered by men. Although sexual discrimination is gradually decreasing over time with improving awareness to social rights and gender equality, there are various difficulties that I have faced.</p>
<p>Following your dreams as a woman engineer and mother can be difficult, as you are expected to take care of your children while working. This is particularly challenging in Korea, where social support is lacking. In my case, there was no other engineer in my family, so I had to plan everything by myself and the absence of social support made it very difficult to develop my career. However, I expect a better outcome for younger generations of women engineers as there is a growing number of foundations, communities, and social structures coming into place with an aim to support young women engineers to follow their dreams.</p>
<p>I always admired the well-established network of male engineers, which easily enabled collaborative research. Therefore, I strongly suggest that young women engineers are more ambitious and actively seek out opportunities that can support their career development and fully grasp everything that is available to them.</p>
<p><strong>You’ve had an international career and you are currently affiliated with institutions in the US, China and South Korea. What is your experience working for these different regions?</strong></p>
<figure class="wp-caption alignleft" id="attachment_10750" style="width: 310px;"><img alt="" class="size-medium wp-image-10750" height="201" src="https://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2019/01/woman-engineer-300x201.jpg" width="300" /><div class="attachment-image--caption">Source: © Gawrav Sinha / Getty Images / iStock</div><div class="attachment-image--source"></div></figure>
<p>Regarding my international career and my affiliation to USA, China, and South Korea as a researcher, there are substantial differences in research methodology and skill level among these countries. USA is still the forerunner of pioneering research and possesses the largest number of global leaders within different academic disciplines.</p>
<p>The research environment in China is rapidly evolving and is becoming globally recognizable with the quality of research improving exponentially over the last two decades. Strong government support for research expansion and a large pool of engineers will provide strong foundation for China to become a leading figure in the future.</p>
<p>Lastly, Korea does not possess a similar level of resources as the US or China to perform or produce similar quantity of research. However, the Korean government is strongly backing their bioengineering industry and globally recognizable industry leaders have started to take more active involvement in the field. They have allocated their resource wisely and many of the researchers and engineers still perform outstanding research and development with a continuous trend of growth and improvement.</p>
<p><strong>What would be your advice for young women who are considering a career in science and engineering?</strong></p>
<p>With continuous growth in engineering field and improvements in social awareness for gender inequality, I strongly believe that there will be a brighter future for young women engineers. There are many globally recognized women engineers actively working in academia or industry, and these leaders can provide a good example for young women engineers to follow.</p>
<p>I’ve partaken in various support programs for woman engineers both at my home institution and abroad with a hope of aiding the career development of young women engineers. The growing trend for various supports and opportunities for networking and mentoring is available for young generations and they should utilize these resources to better prepare themselves within engineering field.</p>
<p>Finally, I would like to once again emphasize for the future woman engineers to be ambitious, fully utilize any resources that are available to them, and to follow their dream as their dreams can come true with hard work.</p>

Professor Ruben Plentz chose to focus his career on clinical medicine in Bremen, despite his tremendous academic achievements in cancer research. Was it because malicious critics harassed him with frivolous investigations and corrections, envious at all those peer-reviewed cancer cures the great doctor invented?

Do investigations into research misconduct allegations need better standards? The Association for the Promotion of Research Integrity (APRIN) in Japan, a group of volunteers who “commit themselves to the promotion of research of high integrity” and provide “e-learning material for research ethics education,” thinks so. Today, we present a guest post by Iekuni Ichikawa, who chaired … <a class="more-link" href="http://retractionwatch.com/2019/01/08/how-to-investigate-allegations-of-research-misconduct-a-checklist/">Continue reading <span class="screen-reader-text">How to investigate allegations of research misconduct: A checklist</span></a>

(b) new estimates of average myelin distribution using brain scan technology (independent of personality, red shows greatest myelination, blue the least). <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/jopy.12442">From Toschi and Passamonti, 2018</a></figure>
<p><em>By</em> <a href="http://www.psychologywriter.org.uk/">Christian Jarrett</a></p>
<p>Researchers are getting closer to understanding the neurological basis of personality. For a new paper <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/jopy.12442">in the <em>Journal of Personality</em></a>, Nicola Toschi and Luca Passamonti took advantage of a recent technological breakthrough that makes it possible to use scans to estimate levels of myelination in different brain areas (until fairly recently this could only be done at postmortem).</p>
<p>Myelin is a fatty substance that insulates nerve fibres and speeds up information processing in the brain – it tends to be thicker in parts of the cortex involved in movement and perception, while it is lighter in brain regions that evolved later and that are involved in more abstract thought and decision making.</p>
<p>The new findings, though preliminary, suggest that people with “healthier”, more advantageous, personality traits, such as more emotional stability and greater conscientiousness, may benefit during development from more enhanced myelination in key areas of the brain where the myelination process is particularly prolonged in humans, continuing through adolescence and into the twenties.</p>
<p><span id="more-35902"></span></p>
<p>The findings are based on brain scans of over 1000 young men and women (average age 29) who also undertook a personality test tapping the “Big Five” traits. Averaged across the entire sample, the researchers found a pattern of myelination through the cortex that closely matched the pattern first discovered over a hundred years ago (from investigation of post-mortem brains) by the German neuroanatomist Paul Flechsig – see image above.</p>
<p>Myelination was generally thicker in the sensory and motor cortices and lighter in frontal and parietal regions. The latter support “higher order” mental functions – the neural architecture in these regions tends to be highly complex, and, though lighter, the myelination process here is later and lengthier, continuing way beyond the teenage years.</p>
<p>While controlling for any differences in intelligence, as well as age, gender and brain volume, the researchers found several links between personality traits and myelination. For instance, lower emotional stability (i.e. higher neuroticism) was correlated with less myelination in the prefrontal cortex, a key brain region for emotional control; higher agreeableness was correlated with greater myelination in orbitofrontal cortex (specifically in the anterior region, previously implicated in prosocial behaviour); and higher conscientiousness correlated with greater myelination in part of the prefrontal cortex (the prefrontal cortex pole, which is associated with the human conscience, among other functions).</p>
<p>The aforementioned correlations suggest a straight-forward pattern whereby what we would usually consider as more advantageous traits are associated with greater myelination in key brain areas. However, the picture was more complicated than that. For example, both higher conscientiousness and higher trait openness were correlated with <em>less</em> myelination in another frontal brain area (the anterior cingulate cortex, a region involved in monitoring mistakes, among other things), and greater neuroticism with <em>more</em> myelination in a part of the occipital lobe (where the visual cortex is located – it’s not clear why this might be, though one could speculate this might be related to enhanced threat detection).</p>
<p>Broadly speaking, the findings “improve our understanding of the neurobiological underpinnings of variability in common behavioral dispositions” Toschi and Passamonti wrote. Summarising their results, they added that “The personality‐related variability in the intra‐cortical myelin content … represent[s] an important proxy measure of the underlying neurodevelopmental mechanisms that shape subject‐specific attitudes in cognitive, emotional, and behavioral functions”. It will be interesting to follow up these results with longitudinal research, to see how personality traits and patterns of myelination co-vary over time, and to investigate the factors, such as genes, diet and education, that may have an influence.</p>

<p>If you’re planning to take off weight in the new year and it suddenly seems like food is everywhere – and is especially enticing – that’s probably your mind playing a particularly unhelpful trick on you. Thinking about food, even in terms of trying to avoid it, can actually make it more likely that you’ll notice food in your environment, especially if you’re already overweight or obese.</p>
<p>That’s according to a recent <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41366-018-0246-3">study</a> in the <i>International Journal of Obesity </i>that<i> </i>compared how overweight and healthy weight people pay attention to food. Food cues – sights, smells, advertisements and social contexts like parties – are everywhere these days, so understanding why some people find it harder to ignore them could be key to designing weight loss programmes.</p>
<p><span id="more-35890"></span></p>
<p>Suzanne Higgs of the University of Birmingham and her colleagues prompted 43 overweight or obese participants and 49 healthy-weight participants to adopt a “food mindset”, or not, during a computerised task by asking them to memorise a picture of a food item, such as pizza, or a non-food item, such as a spanner. Next, they had to locate as fast as possible the position of a circle (left or right-side of the screen), while ignoring the location of a distractor (a square). On some trials the circle was accompanied by a picture of the memorised food item, but on other trials it was the distractor that was accompanied by this food image.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>All the participants found it harder to spot the circle when they were in a food mindset and it was the distractor, rather than the target circle, that was accompanied by an image of food. Crucially, however, the distracting effect of food and being in a food mindset was greater for the overweight or obese participants, suggesting they had a harder time disengaging from food.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>The participants also returned to the lab a year later for a weigh-in. The more that the participants’ task performance had been swayed by a food mindset, the greater their increase in BMI tended to be, indicating that the attentional processes uncovered in the lab have a real-life impact.</p>
<p>“We suggest that thinking about food increases the likelihood of overeating, because a person is more responsive to the presence of food in the environment and, in the long run, this kind of opportunistic eating could lead to weight gain,” Higgs says.</p>
<p>The new findings add to previous research that’s shown it’s hard to ignore food when it’s on our minds. For instance, in an earlier study, Higgs showed that food-related images grab <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0195666312001183?via%25253Dihub">the attention</a> of people preoccupied with food more than do non-food items, even for people of a healthy weight. Once we’ve latched on to a food thought, it’s hard to get past it, particularly if we’re hungry. For example, we might become preoccupied with a tray of chocolate at a party, and find it difficult to concentrate on sparkling conversation.</p>
<p>However, studies so far have cumulatively suggested that overweight people may be more prone to the attention-grabbing properties of food than their lean peers. “It is possible that because many people with obesity are trying to diet, thoughts about restricting food intake actually make it more difficult to ignore food,” Higgs says.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>How, then, can you stick to your dieting resolutions for 2019?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>One way of reducing responsiveness to food cues may be to try to interrupt the flow of food thoughts, Higgs says. Research suggests that distractions like solving puzzles or playing games can reduce food cravings.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Other tips include planning <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2016/04/18/good-news-planning-naughty-lapses-can-help-you-achieve-your-goals/">naughty lapses</a> and <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2016/10/18/is-willpower-overrated/">avoiding temptations</a> in the first place.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

<p>An increasing number of people are taking up recreational running. It often starts with a slow, painful canter around the block, followed by a wheezy vow to get into better shape. Maybe this was you, and you’ve since marshaled enough grit to complete runs of a sufficient length and frequency that you’re now comfortable telling people that you’re an actual, real-life runner. Do you leave it there, or is it time to train for and take part in a proper, organised race?</p>
<p>A recent study suggests it’s worth a go – Marzena Cypryańska and John Nezlek <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/17439760.2018.1557244">report in <em>The Journal of Positive Psychology</em></a> that recreational runners were happier and more satisfied with life during weeks in which they had taken part in an organised race. The pair believe this is because the main aim for most people who take part in (non-elite) organised races is simply to complete the course (which virtually all entrants do).  Therefore “no one loses, no matter how long they take to finish” and finishers usually get some kind of medal or award and come away with a powerful sense of camaraderie and achievement. The researchers add that “In this sense, mass road races, however unwittingly, potentially represent a positive psychology intervention.”</p>
<p><span id="more-35834"></span></p>
<p>Cypryańska and Nezlek recruited hundreds of regular, but non-elite, runners via running websites and magazines and asked them to complete a weekly diary for three months. Each week they recorded whether they’d taken part in an organised race that week (these ranged from 5K runs all the way to full marathons) and also answered numerous questions about their state of wellbeing during the week.</p>
<p>Just over 400 runners (average age 34; 52 per cent women) provided sufficient diary data – at least four weeks’ worth – and among these, 340 ran in at least one race during the study. The results were clear: during weeks that they’d competed in an organised race, the runners on average scored higher on virtually all the wellbeing measures, including experiencing more positive emotions, having higher self-esteem and confidence, feeling more satisfied with life, and that their life had more meaning.</p>
<p>This relationship was still present, but not as comprehensively, for participants who had been a runner for longer. Among more experienced runners, some aspects of wellbeing were no longer correlated with having taking part in a run, perhaps indicative of a habituation effect – the buzz of achievement wearing off a little, but not entirely.</p>
<p>Unsurprisingly, how pleased the runners were with their race performance was also reflected in their wellbeing scores. Focusing on just those weeks that they’d run a race, the participants’ wellbeing was higher when they felt they had performed better.</p>
<p>Overall, the researchers think their results show how competing in organised running races provides an (almost) fail-safe opportunity for personal goal-attainment, with all the psychological reward that that entails, including all-important boosts to feelings of competence and autonomy.</p>
<p>An obvious criticism of this interpretation is the old “correlation doesn’t mean causation” chestnut. It’s possible that during weeks that the runners were feeling more positive, they were simply more likely to enter themselves into a race. Cypryańska and Nezlek acknowledge this possibility, though they think it unlikely – apart from anything, many races require pre-registration and planning many weeks or months in advance.</p>
<p>The next step for this line of research is to use a more fine-grained assessment of runners’ mood states and wellbeing before and after organised races, and to continue measuring for longer afterwards. “For example,” Cypryańska and Nezlek ponder, “can being able to say ‘I ran NY’ imbue an individual with a sense of pride years after the race, and if so, does this sense of pride have implications for well-being?” The pair add that “The present study was not designed to answer such questions, but the present results suggest that such questions may be worth asking.”</p>
<p>Meanwhile, if you’re already a regular runner and wondering whether it’s worth progressing to taking part in organised runs and races, these findings certainly suggest it’s worth a try – you may find the warm glow of achievement gives you a psychological boost.</p>

<p><em>By</em> <a href="http://www.psychologywriter.org.uk/">Christian Jarrett</a></p>
<p>If you want to know about the special relationship between human and canine you need only watch a dog owner slavishly feed, cuddle and clean up after her furry companion, day after day after day. But is this unique cross-species relationship also reflected at a deeper level, in the workings of the canine brain? A <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.3758%2Fs13420-018-0352-z">recent study</a> in <em>Learning and Behavior</em> suggests so, finding that highly trained dogs have a dedicated neural area for processing human faces, separate from the area involved in processing the faces of other dogs.</p>
<p>The researchers, led by Andie Thompkins at Auburn University, say their results are of theoretical importance (in relation to the evolutionary origin of cognitive abilities) and could have practical use too, potentially paving the way to using brain scans to validate the expertise of trained dogs.</p>
<p><span id="more-35797"></span></p>
<p>The researchers trained 12 working dogs (“detector dogs” aged between six months and three years) to lie still in a brain scanner and look at photographs of the faces of humans and dogs. The human faces varied in their familiarity (being both trainers and strangers) and in their emotional expression. Similarly, the dog faces varied in familiarity (being either kennel buddies or canine strangers).</p>
<p>Remarkably, only 5 per cent of the data had to be removed because of excess movement by the canine participants. Analysis of the remaining data showed a distinct pattern of increased brain activity in the participating dogs’ left temporal lobes when viewing the faces. Furthermore, regardless of facial familiarity or emotion, the specific distribution of this activity depended on whether the dogs were looking at human or dog faces.</p>
<p>The “human face area” in the dog brain corresponded with a similar region in the human brain known as the “fusiform face area”, which is particularly involved in processing facial identity. The “dog face area” meanwhile mapped onto the human superior temporal gyrus, perhaps reflecting a functional analogue of the superior temporal sulcus in humans, which is involved in dynamic face processing, including recognising emotions and facial movement.</p>
<p>Previous behavioural research has already established that the ability of dogs to recognise and process human faces surpasses even that of species that are evolutionarily more closely related to us, such as monkeys. The new findings suggest this impressive ability is reflected in the functional geography of the dogs’ brains, with grey matter dedicated to the task.</p>
<p>This conclusion remains somewhat tentative and hard to interpret, however. Not only because this small study needs replicating, but because we can’t know from a brain scan conducted at a single time point whether the observed brain activation patterns are a consequence of the training previously undertaken by these dog participants (meaning that human faces would have been extra important for them) or are a more universally evolved feature of canine cognition.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These kind of findings are most often associated with John Bargh, a Yale University professor and one of the godfathers of social priming. In his 2017 book </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Before You Know It: The Unconscious Reasons We Do What We Do</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, Bargh goes further, even suggesting – based on social priming studies and a small study that found two hours of “hyperthermia” treatment with an infra lamp helped depressed in-patients – that soup might be able to treat depression. “After all,” he writes, “it turns out that a warm bowl of chicken soup really is good for the soul, as the warmth of the soup helps replace the social warmth that may be missing from the person’s life, as when we are lonely or homesick.” He continues, “These simple home remedies are unlikely to make big profits for the pharmaceutical and psychiatric industries, but if the goal is a broader and more general increase in public mental health, some research into their possible helpfulness could pay big dividends for individuals currently in distress, and for society as a whole.”</span></p>
<p><span id="more-35631"></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Of course, it’s a pretty big leap from social-priming studies conducted in labs, or from a small study of a very unusual population, to the idea that maybe chicken soup can rival Prozac — especially when one remembers that millions of clinically depressed people drink hot coffee every day, to no apparent effect. But this nicely captures a common, and important, critique of social priming: Social-priming enthusiasts, both within and outside of academia, have sometimes over-extrapolated on the basis of limited or questionable findings.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Over-extrapolation is one thing, but  what if the original studies simply weren’t even robust in the first place? Recently, a team led by Christopher Chabris and Dan Simons (best known for their “invisible gorilla” work on inattentional blindness), plus other colleagues, sought to replicate two of Bargh’s famous temperature-based findings from 2008. </span><a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2008/11/10/physical-warmth-affects-our-judgments-of-others-and-our-behaviour-towards-them/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">As reported by Research Digest at the time</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, Bargh and his colleague Lawrence Williams contrived a way to have undergrad participants in a lab hold either a hot or a cold drink and then rate a target individual. Students who held the warm drink rated the individual higher on traits having to do with warmth than students who held the cold drink. In a follow-up study conducted out in the world, Williams and Bargh also found that those “holding a hot (versus cold) therapeutic pad were more likely to choose a gift for a friend instead of for themselves,” the theory here being that a sense of warmth makes people more giving and other-focused.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Chabris and his colleagues attempted to replicate both these findings, following the format of the original research quite closely, but on participant samples that were triple the size of the originals, and which likely more closely resemble the general population (for both experiments, rather than relying on undergrads, they recruited people off the streets of Saratoga Springs, New York). As they report in </span><a href="https://psyarxiv.com/mvn9b/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">their preprint available at PsyArXiv</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and due to be published in </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Social Psychology</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">,</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">they found no effects of drink temperature or hot pads on their participants’ judgments or behaviour. Moreover, Chabris and his colleagues used Bayesian analysis (a way of estimating probabilities) to show that “there is substantially more evidence for the null hypothesis of no effect than for the original physical warmth priming hypothesis.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Of course, as Chabris et al note, this still leaves open the possibility that the hot-coffee and hot-pad effects are real – perhaps they simply failed to observe a significant result because of statistical bad luck. Or maybe the effects are real, but bounded in certain important ways. Maybe they only work in a lab, or only among student participants, or only under certain other conditions met in the first study but not the second. Therein lies the problem for social priming both as a scientific field and as a pop-cultural phenomenon: As failed replications pile up, as they seem to be in this domain (other famous social priming effects that have proven hard to re-create </span><a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2016/09/16/ten-famous-psychology-findings-that-its-been-difficult-to-replicate/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">include</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> words related to old-age leading participants to walk more slowly; </span><a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2018/11/16/another-social-psychology-classic-bites-the-dust-meta-analysis-finds-little-evidence-for-the-macbeth-effect/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">washing hands cleaning the conscience</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">; and thoughts of money making us selfish), it gets harder and harder to come up with theories that can 1) explain both the original, exciting-seeming findings and the failed replications; and which 2) aren’t incredibly tangled or boring.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I’ll use an extreme example to illustrate the point: Imagine if it really is the case that this particular hot-coffee priming effect only works on college students under a certain age in lab settings, as opposed to out in the world. What would anyone do with that fact? Why would it matter? It certainly couldn’t be justifiably used to make sweeping statements, presumably applicable to humans writ large, about how “Holding a warm cup of coffee can” do X or Y (let alone that hot soup can cure depression).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But regrettably that’s how these sorts of findings have all been too often communicated: “Holding a warm cup of coffee can make you feel warmer toward others!” And so on. It’s much rarer for social-priming findings — or other sexy research findings from behavioural science — to be presented in an appropriately hedged, scientifically responsible way. That wouldn’t be exciting enough.</span></p>

They were fitted with eye tracking glasses to follow their eye movements (because you can't remember what you don't see), and a GoPro camera was mounted on a helmet. <br /><br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-BOne6jBEPkE/XCpfUkF6nbI/AAAAAAAAMs8/XFZZJTAUSls3H-GRc-tcYjGOtP8IFJIwwCLcBGAs/s1600/We%2Bforget%2Bmost%2Bof%2Bwhat%2Bwe%2Bsee_Exp1.png" style="margin-left: 0em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" data-original-height="320" data-original-width="758" height="168" src="https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-BOne6jBEPkE/XCpfUkF6nbI/AAAAAAAAMs8/XFZZJTAUSls3H-GRc-tcYjGOtP8IFJIwwCLcBGAs/s400/We%2Bforget%2Bmost%2Bof%2Bwhat%2Bwe%2Bsee_Exp1.png" width="400" /></a></div><div style="text-align: center;"><b><span>from Fig. 1 (<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-33792-2" target="_blank">Misra et al., 2018</a>).</span></b></div><br /><br />One problem with this setup, however, was that the eye tracking data had to be excluded. The overwhelmingly bright summer sun prevented the eye tracker from obtaining accurate images of the pupil.

Not surprisingly, people were better at remembering what they looked at (fixated on), but this only held for certain categories of items: talking people, objects rated as “distinctive” (but not distinctive faces), and paintings (but not sculptures).<br /><br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-ql0BmeqCtaE/XCqDrmqV4XI/AAAAAAAAMts/YverTU98WnQvMM4V7z0K_4MlNaOV4-ZPQCLcBGAs/s1600/Fig%2B4_effect%2Bof%2Beye%2Bfixations.png" style="margin-left: 0em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" data-original-height="506" data-original-width="720" height="280" src="https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-ql0BmeqCtaE/XCqDrmqV4XI/AAAAAAAAMts/YverTU98WnQvMM4V7z0K_4MlNaOV4-ZPQCLcBGAs/s400/Fig%2B4_effect%2Bof%2Beye%2Bfixations.png" width="400" /></a></div><div style="text-align: center;"><b><span>Fig. 4 (<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-33792-2" target="_blank">Misra et al., 2018</a>).</span></b></div><br /><br />How do the authors interpret this finding? We don't necessarily pay attention to everything we look at.<br /><blockquote>“What subjects fixated on also correlated with performance (Fig. 4), but it is clear that subjects did not remember everything that they laid eyes on. There is extensive literature showing that subjects may not pay attention or be conscious of what they are fixating on. Therefore, it is quite likely that, in several instances, subjects may have fixated on an object without necessarily paying attention to that object. Additionally, attention is correlated with the encoding of events into memory. Thus, the current results are consistent with the notion that eye fixations correlate with episodic memory but they are neither necessary nor sufficient for successful episodic memory formation.”</blockquote><br />For me personally, 2018 was a year to forget.<span style="color: purple;"><b><sup>2</sup></b></span> Yet, certain tragic images are etched into my mind, cropping up at inopportune times to traumatize me all over again.

So sit back, sip your hot apple cider or spiked egg nog, and revel in family dysfunction worse than your own.<br /><br /><span style="color: #20124d;"><span>{Well! There is an actual TV show called <a href="https://www.oxygen.com/homicide-for-the-holidays" target="_blank" title="on Oxygen, which has morphed from Oprah Lifestyle to True Crime"><i>Homicide for the Holidays</i></a>, which I did not know. Kind of makes my title seem derivative... but it was coincidental.}</span></span><br /><br /><br />“Folie à deux”, or <a href="https://behavenet.com/diagnostic-criteria-2973-shared-psychotic-disorder" target="_blank">Shared Psychotic Disorder</a>, was a diagnosis in DSM-IV-TR:<br /><br /><div style="margin-left: 40px;"><b>(A)</b> A delusion develops in an individual  in the context of a close relationship with another person(s), who has  an already-established delusion. </div><div style="margin-left: 40px;"><br /></div><div style="margin-left: 40px;"><b>(B)</b> The delusion is similar in content to that of the person who already has the established delusion. </div><div style="margin-left: 40px;"><br /></div><div style="margin-left: 40px;"><b>(C)</b> The disturbance is not better accounted for by another Psychotic Disorder (e.g., Schizophrenia) or a Mood Disorder With Psychotic Features and is not due to the direct physiological effects of a substance (e.g., a drug of abuse, a medication) or a general medical condition.</div><br />Folie à deux occurs in the secondary partner, who shares a delusion with the primary partner (diagnosed with schizophrenia, delusional disorder, or psychotic depression). In in DSM-5, folie à deux no longer exists as a specific disorder. Instead, the secondary partner is given a diagnosis of “other specified schizophrenia spectrum and other  psychotic disorder” with a specifier: “delusional symptoms in the partner of individual with delusional  disorder” (APA, 2013).<br /><br />The first cases were reported in the 19th century by the French psychiatrists Baillarger (1860) and <a href="http://www.crossingdialogues.com/Ms-E16-02.htm" target="_blank" title="English translation">Lasègue &amp; Falret (1877</a>). The latter authors note that insanity isn't contagious, but under special circumstances...<br /><blockquote class="tr_bq">a) In the “folie à deux” one individual is the active element; being more intelligent than the other he creates the delusion and gradually imposes it upon the second one who is the passive element. At the beginning the latter resists but later, little by little, he suffers the pressure of his associate, although at the some degree he also reacts and influences the former to correct, modify, and coordinate the delusion that then becomes their common delusion, to be repeated to all in an almost identical fashion and with the same words.</blockquote>The two individuals are in a close relationship and typically live in an isolated environment.<br /><br />A recent paper by <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijlp.2018.10.001" target="_blank"><span class="content"><span class="text surname">Guivarch</span></span> et al. (2018)</a> covered the history of the disorder, and performed a literature review on folie à deux and homicide. They found 17 articles:<br /><blockquote class="tr_bq">In the cases examined, homicides were committed with great violence, usually against a victim in the family circle, and were sometimes followed by suicide. The main risk factor for homicide was the combination of mystical and persecutory delusions. The homicides occurred in response to destabilization of the delusional dyads.</blockquote><br />Body mutilation is not uncommon: “<i>These features appear in the <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0957154X08094236" target="_blank">reported case</a> of a mother who was  delusional and killed her young son by hitting him on the head 3 times  with a hatchet</i>.”<br /><br />The authors presented a detailed history of induced psychosis involving Mr. A (the secondary) and Mrs. A (the primary, who had a family history of delusion). Shortly after getting married, they had a child who was removed by social services due to inadequate parenting.<br /><blockquote class="tr_bq">Subsequently, the couple engaged in several years of delusional  wandering in France and Italy, traveling from village to village to  accomplish <i>“a divine mission”</i>, during which time they were hosted in monasteries  or abbeys. They expressed delusional feelings but never visited a  psychiatrist and were never confronted by the police. The couple's  relationship transformed; the partners stopped having sexual relations  and quickly established a delusional hierarchical relation, with Mrs. A  being called <i>“Your Majesty”</i> and Mr. A considering himself <i>“King of Australia, Secretary of Her Majesty”</i>.</blockquote><br />After about 20 years of this, in a fit of overkill, Mr. A murdered a random 11 year old child by inflicting 44 stab wounds. Earlier, he had felt humiliated and persecuted at a police check point, which provoked  an “incident.” The murder of the child was part of their delusional divine mission, to make a necessary sacrifice that would restore balance.<br /><br /><br /><b>Paranoia of the exalted type in a setting of folie à deux</b><br /><br />The famous case of Pauline P (“a dark, rather sulky looking but not unattractive girl of stocky build”) and Juliet H (“a tall, willowy, frail, attractive blonde with large blue eyes”) was also mentioned (<a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.2044-8341.1955.tb00896.x" target="_blank">Medlicott, 1955</a>). The two girls established a very close bond, constructed an elaborate make-believe world of fictional characters, withdrew from all others, became sexually involved, and developed a superiority complex. They killed Pauline's mother “because one of the girls was going to move with her parents, which would have led to the separation of the delusional dyad (<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S016025271830030X?via%3Dihub#bb0150">Medlicott, 1955</a>).”  This formed the basis of the fantastic 1994 film, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heavenly_Creatures" target="_blank"><i>Heavenly Creatures</i></a>, featuring Melanie Lynskey and Kate Winslet.<br /><br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-oYhX3-G3wSw/XB94LSQwCeI/AAAAAAAAMsk/Pzig5gW2DSgDZYFFE6fyCUfpn248-unaQCLcBGAs/s1600/Kate%2Band%2BMelanie%2Bin%2BHeavely%2BCreatures.jpg" style="margin-left: 0em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" data-original-height="450" data-original-width="800" height="225" src="https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-oYhX3-G3wSw/XB94LSQwCeI/AAAAAAAAMsk/Pzig5gW2DSgDZYFFE6fyCUfpn248-unaQCLcBGAs/s400/Kate%2Band%2BMelanie%2Bin%2BHeavely%2BCreatures.jpg" width="400" /></a></div><br /><br />Granted, their indissoluble bond was pathological, but laughable 1955 views of same-sex relationships were on display in this analysis:<br /><blockquote class="tr_bq">There is of course no doubt that the relationship between these two girls was basically homosexual in nature. Pauline made attempts in 1953 of establishing heterosexual relationships, but in spite of intercourse on one occasion there was no evidence of real erotic involvement. <span style="color: red;"><b>All her escapades were fully discussed with Juliet which is a common feature amongst people basically homosexual in orientation. </b></span> </blockquote><br />Yes, we can generalize and say that all teenage girls in the 1950s commonly bragged about their heterosexual exploits with their lesbian lovers.<br /><br />From Pauline's 1953 diary:<br /><blockquote class="tr_bq">“To-day Juliet and I found the key to the 4th World.  ... We have an extra part of our brain which can appreciate the 4th World. Only about 10 people have it. When we die we will go to the 4th World, but meanwhile on two days every year we may use the key and look in to that beautiful world which we have been lucky enough to be allowed to know of, on this Day of Finding the Key to the Way through the Clouds.”</blockquote><br />Your family gatherings may not always be harmonious, but presumably your delusional children are not plotting to kill you. Happy Holidays. <br /><br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-e1WwyyHO1Vs/XB-A1NbP7RI/AAAAAAAAMsw/ZsvO8wkeQB8BbYyI9HmLYU_QnO7tnZtwwCLcBGAs/s1600/christmas-vacation-christmas-eve-dinner.jpg" style="margin-left: 0em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" data-original-height="480" data-original-width="720" height="266" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-e1WwyyHO1Vs/XB-A1NbP7RI/AAAAAAAAMsw/ZsvO8wkeQB8BbYyI9HmLYU_QnO7tnZtwwCLcBGAs/s400/christmas-vacation-christmas-eve-dinner.jpg" width="400" /></a></div><br /><div style="text-align: center;"><span><b><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Lampoon%27s_Christmas_Vacation" target="_blank"><i>National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation</i></a></b></span></div><br /><br /><b>References</b><br /><br />Baillarger J.

So, any infant born between 23 and 37 weeks gestation is considered premature and many of these infants are hospitalized in the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU) until they reach the equivalent of 37 weeks gestational age. The organ systems of these infants are not fully developed, and, the more premature, the less developed. NICU nurses, therefore, specialize in care practices that are aimed at promoting development.</span><span style="font-size: 1rem;"> </span></p><p><span lang="EN">One of the biggest challenges facing premature newborns hospitalized in the NICU environment is the stress caused by painful procedures, handling, etc. Stress increases cortisol levels in the body. Increased cortisol is detrimental to brain and neural development, which are essential for infant growth and survival.<span> </span></span><span style="font-size: 1rem;"> </span></p><p><span lang="EN">Therefore, given that many infants spend weeks or even months in the NICU, there is a need to use strategies that minimize stress and maximize the environment favorable for growth. Dr. Weber has conducted research using interventions , including skin-to-skin contact, to reduce stress and promote neurodevelopment.<span> </span></span></p><p></p></div>
