              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/antibiotics-babies-immune-response-vaccines-gut-bacteria">Antibiotics diminish babies’ immune response to key vaccines</a></h4>

              
                <p>Taking antibiotics in the first two years of life can prevent babies from developing a robust immune response to certain vaccines. The new finding provides another cautionary tale against overusing antibiotics, researchers say.</p>



<p>Babies get immunized in their first six months, and receive booster doses in their second year, to protect against certain infectious diseases. Antibiotic use during that time was associated with <a href="https://doi.org/10.1542/peds.2021-052061">subpar immune responses to four vaccines babies receive</a> to ward off whooping cough, polio and other diseases, researchers report online April 27 in <em>Pediatrics</em>.</p>



<p>And the more rounds of antibiotics a child received, the more antibody levels to the vaccines dropped below what’s considered protective. Levels induced by the primary series of shots for the polio, diphtheria-tetanus-pertussis, <em>Haemophilus influenzae</em> type b and pneumococcal vaccines fell 5 to 11 percent with each antibiotic course. In the children’s second year, antibody levels generated by booster shots of these vaccines dropped 12 to 21 percent per course.</p>





<p>“If anyone needed yet another reason why overprescription of antibiotics is not a good thing, this paper offers that reason,” says immunologist Bali Pulendran of Stanford University School of Medicine, who was not involved in the study.</p>



<p>Taking antibiotics disrupts the population of bacteria that live in the gut. That’s well known, but researchers are still learning about how that disruption can affect a person’s health. The new study adds to evidence that diminishing the amount and diversity of gut bacteria impacts vaccination. In studies in mice, antibiotics hampered the immune system’s response to vaccines. And a small study in humans found that <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6750738/">antibiotics dampened adults’ response to the flu vaccine</a> in those whose prior immune memory for influenza had waned, Pulendran and colleagues reported in 2019.</p>



<p>The study in <em>Pediatrics</em> is the first to report an association between antibiotic use and compromised vaccine responses in children. Michael Pichichero, a pediatric infectious diseases specialist at the Rochester General Hospital Research Institute in New York, and colleagues collected blood samples taken from 560 children during routine visits with their pediatricians. Of those, 342 children had been prescribed close to 1,700 courses of antibiotics and 218 children had not gotten the drugs. The team analyzed whether antibody levels induced by the four vaccines met the threshold considered protective and found levels more often fell short for the kids who had gotten antibiotics.</p>



<p>The type and length of antibiotic treatment also made a difference. Broad spectrum drugs were associated with antibody levels below what is protective, while a more targeted antibiotic was not. Furthermore, a 10-day course, but not a five-day course, reduced vaccine-induced antibody levels.</p>



<p>The researchers didn’t look at whether children in the study with diminished antibody levels were more likely to develop vaccine-preventable diseases. But there has been concern about <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/whooping-cough-bounces-back">outbreaks of whooping cough</a>, says Pichichero, which have occurred in the the United States despite vaccination (<em>SN: 4/4/14</em>). Perhaps antibiotic use can help explain these outbreaks, he says.</p>



<p>To see what kinds of changes are occurring in the gut bacteria, Pichichero and colleagues are beginning a study with a new group of children. The researchers will collect stool samples along with blood draws and antibiotic use records. They’d like to follow the children past age 5, beyond the time kids receive another round of booster shots, to learn whether antibiotics also interfere with this next opportunity to develop antibodies.</p>



<p>“Antibiotics are miracle medicines,” says Pichichero. “In no way does this study imply that children who need an antibiotic shouldn’t get it.” But if possible, it should be a narrowly targeted antibiotic for a shorter course, he says. Along with the <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/antimicrobial-resistance-cause-death-antibiotic-bacteria">risk of antibiotic resistance</a> that comes with overuse of the drugs (<em>SN: 1/24/22</em>), the impact antibiotics could have on vaccine-induced immunity “has clinical implications for every individual child.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/all-of-the-bases-in-dna-and-rna-have-now-been-found-in-meteorites">All of the bases in DNA and RNA have now been found in meteorites</a></h4>

              
                <p>More of the ingredients for life have been found in meteorites.</p>



<p>Space rocks that fell to Earth within the last century <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-022-29612-x">contain the five bases that store information in DNA and RNA</a>, scientists report April 26 in <em>Nature Communications</em>.</p>



<p>These “nucleobases” — adenine, guanine, cytosine, thymine and uracil — combine with sugars and phosphates to make up the genetic code of all life on Earth. Whether these basic ingredients for life first came from space or instead formed <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/life-earth-origins-hostile-hot-springs-microbes">in a warm soup of earthly chemistry</a> is still not known (<em>SN: 9/24/20</em>). But the discovery adds to evidence that suggests life’s precursors originally came from space, the researchers say.</p>





<p>Scientists have detected bits of <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/meteorites-contain-chemicals-linked-life">adenine, guanine</a> and other organic compounds in meteorites <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/50-years-ago-scientists-first-glimpse-amino-acids-outer-space">since the 1960s</a> (<em>SN: 8/10/11</em>, <em>SN: 12/4/20</em>). Researchers have also seen hints of uracil, but cytosine and thymine remained elusive, until now.</p>



<p>“We&#8217;ve completed the set of all the bases found in DNA and RNA and life on Earth, and they&#8217;re present in meteorites,” says astrochemist Daniel Glavin of NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Md.</p>



<p>A few years ago, geochemist Yasuhiro Oba of Hokkaido University in Sapporo, Japan, and colleagues came up with a technique to gently extract and separate different chemical compounds in liquified meteorite dust and then analyze them.</p>



<p>“Our detection method has orders of magnitude higher sensitivity than that applied in previous studies,” Oba says. Three years ago, the researchers used this same technique to <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/ribose-sugar-needed-life-has-been-detected-meteorites">discover ribose, a sugar needed for life, in three meteorites</a> (<em>SN: 11/22/19</em>).</p>



<p>In the new study, Oba and colleagues combined forces with astrochemists at NASA to analyze one of those three meteorite samples and three additional ones, looking for another type of crucial ingredient for life: nucleobases.</p>



<p>The researchers think their milder extraction technique, which uses cold water instead of the usual acid, keeps the compounds intact. “We’re finding this extraction approach is very amenable for these fragile nucleobases,” Glavin says. “It’s more like a cold brew, rather than making hot tea.”</p>



<p>With this technique, Glavin, Oba and their colleagues measured the abundances of the bases and other compounds related to life in four samples from meteorites that fell decades ago in Australia, Kentucky and British Columbia. In all four, the team detected and measured adenine, guanine, cytosine, uracil, thymine, several compounds related to those bases and a few amino acids.</p>



<p>Using the same technique, the team also measured chemical abundances within soil collected from the Australia site and then compared the measured meteorite values with that of the soil. For some detected compounds, the meteorite values were greater than the surrounding soil, which suggests that the compounds came to Earth in these rocks.</p>



<p>But for other detected compounds, including cytosine and uracil, the soil abundances are as much as 20 times as high as in the meteorites. That could point to earthly contamination, says cosmochemist Michael Callahan of Boise State University in Idaho.</p>



<p>“I think [the researchers] positively identified these compounds,” Callahan says. But “they didn’t present enough compelling data to convince me that they’re truly extraterrestrial.” Callahan previously worked at NASA and collaborated with Glavin and others to measure organic materials in meteorites.</p>



<p>But Glavin and his colleagues point to a few specific detected chemicals to support the hypothesis of an interplanetary origin. In the new analysis, the researchers measured more than a dozen other life-related compounds, including isomers of the nucleobases, Glavin says. Isomers have the same chemical formulas as their associated bases, but their ingredients are organized differently. The team found some of those isomers in the meteorites but not in the soil. “If there had been contamination from the soil, we should have seen those isomers in the soil as well. And we didn&#8217;t,” he says.</p>



<p>Going directly to the source of such meteorites — pristine asteroids — could clear up the matter. Oba and colleagues are already using their extraction technique on pieces from the surface of the asteroid Ryugu, which Japan’s Hayabusa2 mission <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/japan-hayabusa2-asteroid-dirt-sample-clues-early-solar-system">brought to Earth in late 2020</a> (<em>SN: 12/7/20</em>). NASA’s OSIRIS-REx mission is expected to return in September 2023 with similar samples from the asteroid <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/asteroid-sample-missions-hayabusa2-ryugu-osiris-rex-bennu">Bennu</a> (<em>SN: 1/15/19</em>).</p>



<p>“We&#8217;re really excited about what stories those materials have to tell,” Glavin says.</p>

<p>Welcome to our new <em>Research Highlights</em> blog series! A new post series in which we highlight recent noteworthy studies from across PLOS journals. This month, <em>PLOS ONE </em>author Sandra Mart&iacute;n-Pel&aacute;ez of the University of Granada, Spain and colleagues found that cardiovascular risk factors are associated with an increased risk of depression in older adults. Learn more about the study design and authors&rsquo; findings below or jump to the full study on our <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0265079" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">journal site</a>.</p>



<p><strong>Background</strong></p>



<p>Cardiovascular disease and depression are thought to be closely related due to similar risk factors, including inflammation and oxidative stress. Although it has been shown that depression could be a risk factor for developing cardiovascular disease, studies analyzing the potential impact of cardiovascular health on developing depression are scarce.</p>



<p><strong>Study Design</strong></p>



<p>In the new study, the researchers used data from an ongoing 6-year multi-center randomized trial in Spain which analyzes the effect of a Mediterranean Diet on men aged 55-75 and women aged 60-75 with overweight or obesity. 6,545 individuals with no cardiovascular or endocrine disease at baseline were included in the current analysis. A cardiovascular risk score according to the Framingham-based REGICOR function was calculated for each person, dividing participants into low (LR), medium (MR), or high/very high (HR) cardiovascular risk groups. Depressive status was gauged using a questionnaire at baseline and after 2 years of follow-up.</p>



<p><strong>Findings</strong></p>



<p>At baseline, women in the HR group showed higher odds of depressive status than LR women (Odds Ratio* 1.78 95% Confidence Interval** 1.26-2.50). In addition, among all participants with baseline total cholesterol below 160 mg/mL, MR and HR individuals showed higher odds of depression than LR (MR: OR 1.77 95% CI 1.13-2.77; HR: OR 2.83 95% CI 1.25-6.42). On the contrary, among participants with total cholesterol of 280 mg/mL or higher, MR and HR individuals had a lower risk of depression than LR (MR: OR 0.26 95% CI 0.07-0.98; HR: OR 0.23 95% CI 0.05-0.95). After two years, during which time all individuals were instructed to follow a Mediterranean Diet as part of the trial, participants, on average, decreased their depressive status score, with the greatest decreases seen for MR and HR participants with high baseline cholesterol levels.</p>



<p><strong> Conclusion</strong></p>



<p>The authors conclude that high and very high cardiovascular risk are associated with depressive symptoms, especially in women, and that the role of other factors, such as adherence to the Mediterranean Diet, deserves further research.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">More than two years into the COVID-19 pandemic there are still many open questions, including why some patients experience persistent symptoms weeks after first testing positive. In their recently published study researchers from the Gregorio Marañon Microbiology ID COVID 19 Study Group evaluate patients who report fatigue, muscle pain, dyspnea, inappropriate tachycardia and low-grade fever at least four weeks following initial diagnosis with SARS-CoV-2. Their results show that more than half of these patients experienced only mild COVID-19 symptoms during their initial illness but still developed lasting symptoms. A significant number had detectable SARS-CoV-2 RNA in plasma, urine or stool samples several weeks post infection. The study further found that antiviral treatment strategies may be beneficial for patients with this possible systemic viral persistence.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The importance of the microbiome on survival and fitness of animals has been increasingly recognised in the scientific community and in recent years we have seen a wealth of publications on different microbial communities within humans, mice and other animals. The intestinal microbiome in particular is highly dependent on the feeding status of the host organism and different phyla are differently affected by starvation periods. To study how starvation and refeeding impact on the composition of the microbiome as well as on host gene expression, researchers from Duke University used zebrafish in this recent </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">BMC Genomics</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400"> publication. Interestingly, they find that the abundance of two core microbiome genera of zebrafish – </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">Vibrio</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400"> and </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">Plesiomonas</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400"> – react in opposite ways to starvation, with </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">Vibrio</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400"> bacteria increasing and </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">Plesiomonas</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400"> showing reductions. Concurrently, transcriptomics data of the host genes shows drastically altered expression of ribosome biogenesis early in starvation, followed by decreased expression of genes responsible for antiviral immunity as well as lipid transport in later stages. Both host transcription and microbiome were shown to recover quickly within only three days of refeeding.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Reproductive strategy describes how different animal species balance the trade-off between energetic costs and mortality associated with reproduction to maximise survival of both parents and offspring. European insectivorous bats such as the common noctule (</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">Nyctalus noctula</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400">) make use of delayed fertilisation, where sperm is stored in the female reproductive organs during hibernation. In their recent publication, researchers from Brno assess what factors determine whether a female noctule gives birth to a single neonate or to twins, finding that high progesterone levels during early stages of gestation are a good indicator for successful twin pregnancies. Additionally, their results show that the longer the hibernation period, the shorter the gestation period. The authors conclude that females can optimise their thermoregulatory behaviour and are able to manipulate their litter size.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The last years have seen immense progress in researching musculoskeletal impairments in patients with cerebral palsy (CP). Many CP patients show significant reduction in muscle volume, often with shorter muscles and fewer sarcomeres. Satellite cell numbers are also often reduced significantly leading to impaired muscle regeneration and thus stiffer and weaker muscles. Based on these differences, CP patients often participate less in physical activity which in turn increases their risk for secondary sarcopenia (muscle loss). Clinical phenotypes of cerebral palsy are very heterogeneous requiring individual treatment strategies. In their narrative review, Handsfield and colleagues summarise recent findings on the pathology and treatment strategies of CP, as well as highlighting areas where more work is needed.  </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">How can healthcare professionals assess consciousness in unresponsive patients to avoid misdiagnosis and offer the highest standard of care? In a recent article in </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">BMC Medical Ethics</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400"> researchers assess the usefulness of different indicators of consciousness originally developed for determining the level of consciousness in artificial intelligence and animals for use in human patients, such as individuals in comas. Among these indicators, the authors discuss goal-directed behaviour, brain anatomy and physiology, psychometrics and meta-cognitive judgment and episodic memory. As the diagnosis of consciousness has important ethical dimensions, the researchers emphasise the need for a gold standard in detecting consciousness and the requirement for refined taxonomy of disorders of consciousness.</span></p>

              <h4><a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2022/04/26/background-music-can-make-us-less-cautious/">Background music can make us less cautious</a></h4>

              
                <p><em>By</em> <a href="https://emmayoung.net/">Emma Young</a></p>



<p>Background music is a feature of most people’s everyday lives. Whether it’s while driving, at the gym, at home, or even at work, we often have music playing while we’re doing something else. Research into precisely how this affects our behaviour, emotions and cognitive processes have provided mixed findings, however. One of the reasons, argue Agustín Perez Santangelo at the University of Buenos Aires and colleagues, is there are so many variables, both in terms of the type of music used in the studies, and also the aspects of performance being measured — so it’s no wonder that results have been inconsistent.</p>



<p>Santangelo’s team decided, therefore, to explore changes in just one musical variable — tempo — and to look for effects on two individual aspects of decision-making: speed and accuracy. And they report in <a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2022-46608-001">their paper</a> in the <em>Journal of Experimental Psychology: General</em>, that background music did indeed have an effect: it made the participants less cautious.</p>



<span id="more-46066"></span>



<p>A total of 32 participants completed a series of tasks three times: in silence, and while listening to the classical, instrumental piece The Flight of the Bumblebee by Rimsky-Korsakov, at a tempo of 40 beats per minute and also at 190 beats per minute (with all other musical features unchanged). This was the biggest difference in tempo that the team felt it was reasonable to use. (And the participants did give pretty much the same liking ratings for both versions.)</p>



<p>The tasks were of different types and levels of difficulty. There were two perceptual tasks (the participants had to decide whether a cloud of dots on a screen was moving to the left or the right, for example), a general knowledge task; a lexical categorisation task (a string of five to eight letters was displayed, and they had to decide whether it was a word or not); and also a task that involved repeatedly choosing which they preferred of two snack options (they had earlier rated 100 snacks; picking the one they had earlier reported liking better was taken as a correct response). For every decision, they were instructed to respond as quickly and accurately as possible.</p>



<p>In total, the researchers gathered data on just over 100,000 individual decisions. And the analysis threw up a few clear findings. First, the presence of music — vs silence — affected performance on all of the tasks. It led participants to make faster and also less accurate decisions.</p>



<p>Interestingly, tempo had no bearing on this: whether the music was fast or slow, this effect was the same. Some earlier studies have suggested that because a faster tempo increases physiological arousal, it &#8220;speeds&#8221; us up, too, quickening our responses. The participants in this study did report feeling more physiological arousal while listening to the fast vs slow version — but this did not translate into relatively faster responses.</p>



<p>So what might explain the findings? The researchers suspect that the background music caused a shift in the decision-making process itself — that it reduced the amount of data that the participants’ brains required to reach a decision. This would lead to what they found: quicker but less accurate responses.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Is all background music likely to do this? The researchers used only one piece, so it’s impossible to know from this study. But the liking ratings did show that the participants weren’t too keen on it, whether it was fast or slow. It might be that the music induced a mildly negative emotional state, and it was this, rather than the music per se, that tweaked their decision-making. Other types of music might have different effects, then, as might other kinds of background noise.</p>



<p>One of the strengths of this study, compared with some others in the field, is that the team stripped the number of variables right down. This made it easier to explore the impacts of different experimental conditions. However, when we listen to background music in the real world, the variables are legion. The team suggests that perhaps background music has a negative impact on driving-related decisions, for example — but it’s not possible to directly extrapolate.</p>



<p>Still, the finding that background music can affect the process of reaching a decision is an interesting one. As the team writes, such music is “seemingly innocuous and ubiquitous” — but if, in some circumstances, it makes us less cautious, that’s worth exploring further.</p>

<p><a href="https://bookshop.org/a/21798/9781324006596">The Insect Crisis</a><br><em>Oliver Milman<br>W.W. Norton &amp; Co., $27.95</em></p>



<p>Imagine a world without insects. You might breathe a sigh of relief at the thought of mosquito-free summers, or you might worry about how agriculture will function without pollinators. What you probably won’t picture is trudging through a landscape littered with feces and rotting corpses — what a world devoid of maggots and dung beetles would look like.</p>



<p>That’s just a snippet of the horrifying picture of an insect-free future that journalist Oliver Milman paints in the beginning of <em>The Insect Crisis</em>. “The loss of insects would be an agonizing ordeal eclipsing any war and even rivaling the looming ravages of climate breakdown,” he writes. And yet, the threat of an impending “insect apocalypse” doesn’t get nearly the same level of attention as climate change.</p>





<p>Researchers have been observing declining insect populations for decades. For instance, a study of nearly 40 years of data from a protected rainforest in Puerto Rico found that insect biomass had decreased by 98 percent on the ground and 80 percent in the canopy since the mid-1970s.</p>



<p>The threats insects face are many: <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/streetlights-especially-super-bright-leds-may-harm-insect-populations">Light pollution</a>, the increasing <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/blog/science-ticker/evidence-piles-popular-pesticides-link-pollinator-problems">use of pesticides</a> and <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/bumblebee-territory-shrinking-under-climate-change">climate change</a> are just a few (<em>SN: 8/31/21</em>; <em>SN: 8/17/16</em>; <em>SN: 7/9/15</em>). And it’s not only rare species that are at risk — it’s also species that were once common around the globe.</p>



<p>The reality of the crisis isn’t as foreboding as Milman initially makes it seem. A world with no insects is unlikely, he acknowledges. Studies have found that while some species are in decline, others, such as <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/insect-apocalypse-declines-biodiversity">freshwater insects, are doing fine</a> (<em>SN: 4/23/20</em>). Rather than viewing the insect crisis as all insect populations on one downward-trending line on a graph, Milman suggests picturing lots of different lines — some holding steady, some sloping up or down, and some zigzagging. “Insects are being shifted to an unhappy state where there will be far more bedbugs and mosquitoes and far fewer bumblebees and monarch butterflies,” he writes.</p>



<p>Those changes in biodiversity come with consequences. Farmers may have to fend off more pests that attack soybeans, for instance, and insect-pollinated fruits and vegetables will become hard to grow at scale. Some insect-eating animals will decline as their food disappears, which <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/decline-birds-linked-common-insecticide">has already happened to some birds</a> (<em>SN: 7/11/14</em>), or even vanish. Water and soil quality could also be in jeopardy.</p>





<p>Milman investigates the crisis by sharing his own adventures with insects, along with those of researchers, taking readers from the United States to Mexico, across the Atlantic to Europe and all the way to Australia. By sharing scientists’ stories, he makes the plight of insects personal. There’s a researcher in Denmark who has spent 25 years surveying insect populations by driving his old Ford Anglia down the same country roads and counting the number of bugs squashed against the windshield. Back when he started, he’d regularly have to clean insect guts off his car. But in recent years, he has experienced a lot of “zero insect days.” As I read that, I struggled to remember the last time I had to scrape any dead insects off my car. Another researcher recalls the joy of catching fireflies on his family ranch in Texas as a child. I felt a wave of sadness as I thought about how I don’t see fireflies as much as I did when I was a kid. With more streetlights and the switch to LED bulbs, it’s becoming harder for fireflies to spot potential mates.</p>



<p>Amid the doom and gloom, the book still manages to spark awe and delight with fun facts about insects. Bumblebee wings, for instance, vibrate so fast that they can produce gravitational forces of up to 50 g’s — five times greater than what fighter jet pilots experience. Milman also offers hope, sharing how certain insects are adapting to the threats and how some people are fighting to protect the critters through political campaigns and changing farming habits.</p>



<p>By the book’s end, readers may find that their attitude toward some insects has shifted from loathing to love, or at the very least, appreciation. (I, for one, never cared much for flies — until I learned we wouldn’t have chocolate without them.) Milman makes clear how much we benefit from insects, and what we stand to lose without them. As one researcher puts it, our deeply woven reliance on insects is like the internet: When parts of the network are removed, the less internet there is, “until eventually it doesn’t work anymore.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/camera-lens-trilobite-eye-focus-metalens">This camera lens can focus up close and far away at the same time</a></h4>

              
                <p>Ben Franklin had nothing on trilobites.</p>



<p>Roughly 400 million years before the founding father invented bifocals, the now extinct trilobite <em>Dalmanitina socialis </em><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/trilobite-eyes-impressive-feat-early-evolution">already had a superior version</a> (<em>SN: 2/2/74</em>). Not only could the sea critter see things both near and far, it could also see both distances in focus at the same time — an ability that eludes most eyes and cameras.</p>



<p>Now, a new type of camera sees the world the way this trilobite did. Inspired by <em>D. socialis</em>’s eyes, the camera can simultaneously focus on two points <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-022-29568-y">anywhere between three centimeters and nearly two kilometers away</a>, researchers report April 19 in <em>Nature Communications</em>.</p>





<p>“In optics, there was a problem,” says Amit Agrawal, a physicist at the National Institute of Standards and Technology in Gaithersburg, Md. If you wanted to focus a single lens to two different points, you just simply could not do it, he says.</p>



<p>If a camera could see like a trilobite, Agrawal figured, it could capture high-quality images with higher depths of field. A high depth of field — the distance between the nearest and farthest points that a camera can bring into focus — is important for the relatively new technique of light-field photography, which uses many tiny lenses to produce 3-D photos.</p>



<p>To mimic the trilobite’s ability, the team constructed a metalens, a type of flat lens made up of millions of differently-sized rectangular nanopillars arranged like a cityscape — if skyscrapers were one two-hundredth the width of a human hair. The nanopillars act as obstacles that bend light in different ways depending on their shape, size and arrangement. The researchers arranged the pillars so some light traveled through one part of the lens and some light through another, creating two different focal points.</p>

<p>To use the device in a light-field camera, the team then built an array of identical metalenses that could capture thousands of tiny images. When combined, the result is an image that’s in focus closeup and far away, but blurry in between. The blurry bits are then sharpened with a type of machine learning computer program.</p>



<p>Achieving a large depth of field can help the program recover depth information, says Ivo Ihrke, a computational imaging scientist at the University of Siegen in Germany who was not involved with this research. Standard images don’t contain information about the distances to objects in the photo, but 3-D images do. So the more depth information that can be captured, the better.</p>



<p>The trilobite approach isn’t the only way to boost the range of visual acuity. Other cameras using a different method have accomplished a similar depth of field, Ihrke says. For instance, a light-field camera made by the company Raytrix contains an array of tiny glass lenses of three different types that work in concert, with each type tailored to focus light from a particular distance. The trilobite way also uses an array of lenses, but all the lenses are the same, each one capable of doing all the depth-of-focus work on its own — which helps achieve a slightly higher resolution than using different types of lenses.</p>



<p>Regardless of how it’s done, all the recent advances in capturing depth with light-field cameras will improve imaging techniques that depend on that depth, Agrawal says. These techniques could someday help self-driving cars to track distances to other vehicles, for example, or Mars rovers to gauge distances to and sizes of landmarks in their vicinity.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/orb-spiders-mating-male-catapult-female-sex-cannibalism">These male spiders catapult away to avoid being cannibalized after sex</a></h4>

              
                <p>An act of acrobatics keeps males of one orb-weaving spider species from becoming their mates’ post-sex snack.</p>



<p>After mating, <em>Philoponella prominens</em> males <a href="https://www.cell.com/current-biology/fulltext/S0960-9822(22)00485-7">catapult away from females</a> at speeds up to nearly 90 centimeters per second, researchers report April 25 in <em>Current Biology</em>. Other spiders jump to <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/slingshot-spider-web-acceleration">capture prey</a> or avoid predators (<em>SN: 3/16/19</em>). But <em>P. prominens</em> is unique among spiders in that males soar through the air to avoid sexual cannibalism, the researchers say.</p>



<p><em>P. prominens </em>is a social species that’s native to countries such as Japan and Korea. Up to 300 individual spiders can come together to weave an entire neighborhood of webs. While studying <em>P. prominens’ </em>sexual behavior, arachnologist Shichang Zhang and colleagues noticed that sex seemed to always end with a catapulting male. But the movement was “so fast that common cameras could not record the details,” says Zhang, of Hubei University in Wuhan, China.</p>





<p>High-resolution video of mating partners clocked the male arachnids’ speed from around 32 cm/s to 88 cm/s, the researchers report. That’s equal to just under 1 mile per hour to nearly 2 mph.</p>

<p>The jump looks a little like the start of a backstroke swimming race, Zhang says. Males hold the tips of their front legs against a female’s body. The spiders then use hydraulic pressure to extend a joint in those legs, quickly launching a male off a female before she can capture and eat him.</p>



<p>Of 155 successful mating rituals that the researchers observed, 152 males catapulted to survival. The remaining three that didn’t fell victim to their partner. Female spiders also ate all 30 males that the team stopped from jumping to freedom with a paintbrush.</p>



<p>These male orb weavers probably acquired their jumping abilities to counter females’ cannibalistic tendencies, Zhang says. The spiders’ leap to survival is a “fantastic kinetic performance.”</p>

<p><a href="https://bookshop.org/a/21798/9781250271044">The Last Days of the Dinosaurs</a><br><em>Riley Black</em><br><em>St. Martin’s Press, $28.99</em></p>



<p>Some 66 million years ago, give or take several millennia, a 10-kilometer-wide asteroid slammed into our planet. The impact blasted out an enormous crater and heaved large amounts of material into the atmosphere. Some of the sulfur-rich debris poisoned the sky, unleashing downpours of acid rain. Heat generated by ejecta falling back to Earth ignited wildfires worldwide that blazed for months, if not years. In the wake of the event, as many as 75 percent of all species were wiped out.</p>





<p>In <em>The Last Days of the Dinosaurs</em>, science writer Riley Black chronicles both the pre-apocalyptic idyll and the worldwide devastation that resulted from what some scientists have dubbed “Earth’s worst day.” The book is a compelling amalgamation of both new and old scientific information (and some science-based speculation).</p>



<p>Black begins her tale by exploring what happened in the Hell Creek area of today’s Montana, whose rocks offer what is perhaps the best record of a dinosaur habitat. This ancient ecosystem and others worldwide included far more than apex predators, such as <em>Tyrannosaurus rex</em>, and their prey, of course; they also hosted a wealth of creatures, including lice and other parasites.</p>



<p>These ecosystems drastically changed once the space rock hit. Larger dinosaurs, as well as any smaller creatures unable to shelter in burrows, for example, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/dinosaur-killer-asteroid-chicxulub-spring-impact-fossils-fish">couldn’t escape the destruction</a> (<em>SN: 3/26/22, p. 8</em>).</p>



<p>Despite the title, the largest part of Black’s book recounts how life rebounded in the 1 million years after the impact. Forest floors served as natural seed banks to feed surviving insects, birds and small mammals. These seeds, some of which had previously evolved to withstand wildfires, were also the sources of forests that grew back. Those initial forests were stubby and dominated by ferns for years. Some ecosystems — especially freshwater lakes and rivers whose waters were chemically buffered from acid rain by dissolved carbonates derived from limestones — emerged relatively unscathed and so species persisted there.</p>





<p>Evolution is usually driven by gradual change, Black notes. But the dinosaur-killing impact was so abrupt and caused such extreme environmental changes that most species couldn’t adapt. In fact, she notes, animals and plants that weren’t already preadapted to the new state of affairs rapidly succumbed and thus left no descendants.</p>



<p>Yet in devastation lay opportunities: Ecological roles that had been occupied by dinosaurs for at least 100 million years were suddenly available, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/dinosaurs-out-way-mammals-had-chance-thrive">setting the stage for the slow but steady rise of mammals</a> and the world we inhabit today (<em>SN: 2/4/17, p. 22</em>).</p>



<p>While engaging and approachable, <em>The Last Days of the Dinosaurs</em> is scrupulously rooted in information gathered by paleontologists, geologists, astronomers, physicists and ecologists. In vignettes at the end of each chapter, Black explores what was unfolding at locales far from Hell Creek. In an extensive appendix, she painstakingly helps readers sort through what’s fact and what’s speculation in those scenes. For example, the behaviors of burrowing mammals during the impact and its aftermath are presumed to be similar to those inferred from the fossils of similarly sized mammals that lived a few million years earlier.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/black-hole-gravitational-waves-kick-ligo-merger-spacetime">Gravitational waves gave a new black hole a high-speed ‘kick’</a></h4>

              
                <p>This black hole really knows how to kick back.</p>



<p>Scientists recently observed two black holes that united into one, and in the process got a “kick” that flung the newly formed black hole away at high speed. That black hole <a href="https://journals.aps.org/prl/accepted/9f07dYb3A0719b7220a98c25dc34b66490fc218ab">zoomed off</a> at about 5 million kilometers per hour, give or take a few million, researchers report in a paper in press in <em>Physical Review Letters</em>. That’s blazingly quick: The speed of light is just 200 times as fast.</p>



<p>Ripples in spacetime, called gravitational waves, launched the black hole on its breakneck exit. As any two paired-up black holes spiral inward and coalesce, they emit these ripples, which stretch and squeeze space. If those gravitational waves are shot off into the cosmos in one direction preferentially, the black hole will recoil in response.</p>





<p>It’s akin to a gun kicking back after shooting a bullet, says astrophysicist Vijay Varma of the Max Planck Institute for Gravitational Physics in Potsdam, Germany.</p>



<p>Gravitational wave observatories LIGO and Virgo, located in the United States and Italy, detected the black holes’ spacetime ripples when they reached Earth on January 29, 2020. Those waves revealed details of how the black holes merged, hinting that a large kick was probable. As the black holes orbited one another, the plane in which they orbited rotated, or precessed, similar to how a top wobbles as it spins. Precessing black holes are expected to get bigger kicks when they merge.</p>



<p>So Varma and colleagues delved deeper into the data, gauging whether the black hole got the boot. To estimate the kick velocity, the researchers compared the data with various predicted versions of black hole mergers, created based on computer simulations that solve the equations of general relativity, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/einstein-theory-general-relativity-gravity-black-holes-cosmos">Einstein’s theory of gravity</a> (<em>SN: 2/3/21</em>). The recoil was so large, the researchers found, that the black hole was probably ejected from its home and kicked to the cosmic curb.</p>



<p>Dense groups of stars and black holes called globular clusters are one locale where black holes are thought to partner up and merge. The probability that the kicked black hole would stay within a globular cluster home is only about 0.5 percent, the team calculated. For a black hole in another type of dense environment, called a nuclear star cluster, the probability of sticking around was about 8 percent.</p>



<p>The black hole’s great escape could have big implications. LIGO and Virgo detect mergers of stellar-mass black holes, which form when a star explodes in a supernova and collapses into a black hole. Scientists want to understand if black holes that partner up in crowded clusters could partner up again, going through multiple rounds of melding. If they do, that could help explain some <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/physics-gravitational-waves-midsize-black-hole-collision-ligo-virgo">surprisingly bulky black holes</a> previously seen in mergers (<em>SN: 9/2/20</em>). But if merged black holes commonly get rocketed away from home, that would make multiple mergers less likely.</p>



<p>“Kicks are very important in understanding how heavy stellar-mass black holes form,” Varma says.</p>



<p>Previously, astronomers have gleaned evidence of gravitational waves giving <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/supermassive-black-hole-gets-kicked-galactic-curb">big kicks to supermassive black holes</a>, the much larger beasts found at the centers of galaxies (<em>SN: 3/28/17</em>). But that conclusion hinges on observations of light, rather than gravitational waves. “Gravitational waves, in a way, are cleaner and easier to interpret,” says astrophysicist Manuela Campanelli of the Rochester Institute of Technology in New York, who was not involved in the new study.</p>



<p>LIGO and Virgo data had already revealed some evidence of black holes getting small kicks. The new study is the first to report using gravitational waves to spot a black hole on the receiving end of a large kick.</p>



<p>That big kick isn’t a surprise, Campanelli says. Earlier theoretical predictions by Campanelli and colleagues suggested that such powerful kicks were possible. “It’s always exciting when someone can measure from observations what you predicted from calculations.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/glowing-spider-fossils-diatom-algae-goo">Glowing spider fossils may exist thanks to tiny algae’s goo </a></h4>

              
                <p>The secret ingredient for fossil preservation at a famous French site wouldn’t be found in a Julia Child cookbook. It was a sticky goo made by microalgae, researchers suggest.</p>



<p>An analysis of roughly 22-million-year-old spider fossils from a fossil-rich rock formation in Aix-en-Provence, France, reveals that the arachnids’ bodies were coated with a tarry black substance. That substance, a kind of biopolymer, <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s43247-022-00424-7">was probably secreted by tiny algae called diatoms</a> that lived in the lake or lagoon waters at the ancient site, scientists report April 21 in <em>Communications Earth &amp; Environment</em>.</p>



<p>The biopolymer didn’t just coat the spiders’ bodies — it pickled them. By chemically reacting with the spiders’ carbon-rich exoskeletons, the goo helped preserve the bodies from decomposition, allowing them to more easily become fossils, the team hypothesizes.</p>





<p>A clue that this coating might play a role in fossilization came when the researchers, on a whim, placed a spider fossil under a fluorescence microscope. To their surprise, the substance glowed a bright yellow-orange. “It was amazing!” says geologist Alison Olcott of the University of Kansas in Lawrence.</p>



<p>The fluorescent imaging painted a bright, colorful palette onto what was otherwise a fairly faint spider fossil, Olcott says. In the original, she could barely tell the spider apart from the background rock. But under fluorescence, she says, the spider fossil glowed in one color, the background in another and the biopolymer in a third.</p>



<p>That discovery — along with an abrupt halt in early 2020 to any additional fossil-collecting plans due to the COVID-19 pandemic — swiftly shifted the focus of the team’s work. “Had it been normal times, this would have been a side note in a taxonomy study” classifying ancient spiders, Olcott says. Instead, “I really had to explore what I had,” she adds. “It was me and these images.”</p>



<p>The researchers next sought to identify the chemical makeup of the mysterious substance. The orange-yellow glow, the team found, comes from abundant carbon and sulfur in the coating. “That got me thinking about sulfurization,” Olcott says.</p>

<p>Sulfurization is the reaction of organic carbon with sulfur, which forms sturdy chemical bonds with the carbon, making it more resistant to degradation and breakdown — similar to how tire manufacturers harden rubber to make it more durable. The process requires a ready supply of sulfur available for bonding.</p>



<p>In modern times, such <a href="https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/2021GB007062">a supply comes from the sulfur-rich gooey secretions of diatoms</a>, microalgae found floating in many waters around the world. When these secretions meet carbon-laden marine particles headed for the bottom of the ocean, this sulfurization process helps lock the carbon in place and possibly keep it buried in the seafloor.</p>



<p>Similarly, sulfurization might help to preserve delicate carbon-rich fossils, helping them to withstand the test of millions of years of geologic time, Olcott says. Scientists have often noted diatoms in the fossil-bearing rock formations of Aix-en-Provence, as well as at many similar fossil-rich sites, she adds. “Everyone’s seeing diatoms everywhere. Thinking about that and the chemistry, I was like, ‘Wait a minute. All the pieces are here to make this chemistry happen.’”</p>



<p>The arachnids’ preservation might have gone like this: A dead spider, floating in the water column, became covered in the diatoms’ sticky goo. The goo chemically reacted with the spider’s chitin exoskeleton, more or less pickling it and keeping the exoskeleton largely intact and ready for fossilization.</p>



<p>That scenario “makes sense based on what we know about organic sulfur cycling in modern environments so far,” says Morgan Raven, an organic geochemist at the University of California, Santa Barbara. Scientists still have a lot to learn about the conditions that allow materials like chitin to sulfurize, Raven says. “But this study highlights why that matters.”</p>



<p>For example, if sulfurization selectively helps preserve some types of organic matter — such as soft-bodied fossils — that “could be a crucial filter on our fossil record, influencing what we do and don’t know about plant and animal evolution,” she adds.</p>



<p>This process of diatom-assisted sulfurization may have been at work in other fossil-rich sites during the Cenozoic Era, Olcott says. That span of time began 66 million years ago, after an asteroid ended the Age of Dinosaurs, and continues to the present day. Before that era, diatoms were not widespread. That didn’t happen until <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/hippo-poop-cycles-silicon-through-east-african-environment">silica-bearing grasses</a> sprouted around the world during the Cenozoic, offering a ready source of silica for the tiny creatures to build their delicate bodies (<em>SN: 5/1/19</em>).</p>



<p>It’s unknown if other biopolymer-producing algae might have helped fossilize soft-bodied creatures from even earlier, such as during <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/iconic-fossils-some-worlds-top-cambrian-sites">the flourishing of Cambrian Period life</a>-forms beginning around 541 million years ago, Olcott says (<em>SN: 4/24/19</em>). “But it would be really interesting to expand this further out.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/large-hadron-collider-restart-upgrades">The Large Hadron Collider has restarted with upgraded proton-smashing potential</a></h4>

              
                <p>After a hiatus of more than three years, the Large Hadron Collider is back.</p>



<p>Scientists <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/cern-large-hadron-collider-shutting-down-2-years">shut down the particle accelerator</a> in 2018 to allow for upgrades (<em>SN: 12/3/18</em>). On April 22, protons once again careened around the 27-kilometer-long ring of the Large Hadron Collider, or LHC, located at the particle physics laboratory CERN in Geneva.</p>



<p>The LHC is coming out of hibernation gradually. Researchers started the accelerator’s proton beams out at relatively low energy, but will ramp up to slam protons together at a planned record-high energy of 13.6 trillion electron volts. Previously, LHC collisions reached 13 trillion electron volts. Likewise, the beams are starting out wimpy, with relatively few protons, but will build to higher intensity. And when fully up to speed, the upgraded accelerator will pump out proton collisions more quickly than in previous runs. Experiments at the LHC will start taking data this summer.</p>





<p>Physicists will use this data to further characterize the <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/higgs-found">Higgs boson</a>, the particle discovered at the LHC in 2012 that reveals the source of mass for elementary particles (<em>SN: 7/4/12</em>). And researchers will be keeping an eye out for new particles or anything else that clashes with the standard model, the theory of the known particles and their interactions. For example, researchers will continue the <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/latest-dark-matter-searches-leave-scientists-empty-handed">hunt for dark matter</a>, a mysterious substance that so far can be observed only by its gravitational effects on the cosmos (<em>SN: 10/25/16</em>).</p>



<p>After several years of operations, the LHC will shut down again to prepare the <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/blog/science-ticker/large-hadron-collider-getting-upgrade">High-Luminosity LHC</a> (<em>SN: 6/15/18</em>), which will further boost the rate of proton collisions and allow for even more detailed studies of the fundamental constituents of matter.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/muon-subatomic-particle-volcano-pyramid-physics">Muons spill secrets about Earth’s hidden structures</a></h4>

              
                <p class="has-drop-cap" style="font-size:20px">Inside Egypt’s Great Pyramid of Giza lies a mysterious cavity, its void unseen by any living human, its surface untouched by modern hands. But luckily, scientists are no longer limited by human senses.</p>



<p>To feel out the contours of the pyramid’s unexplored interior, scientists followed the paths of tiny subatomic particles called muons. Those particles, born high in Earth’s atmosphere, hurtled toward the surface and burrowed through the pyramid. Some of the particles imprinted hints of what they encountered on sensitive detectors in and around the pyramid. The particles’ paths <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/mystery-void-discovered-great-pyramid-giza">revealed the surprising presence of the hidden chamber</a>, announced in 2017 (<em>SN: 11/25/17, p. 6</em>).</p>



<p>That stunning discovery sparked plans among physicists to use muons to explore other archaeological structures. And some researchers are using the technique, called muography, to map out volcanoes’ plumbing. “You can see inside the volcano, really,” says geophysicist Giovanni Leone of Universidad de Atacama in Copiapó, Chile. That internal view could give scientists more information about how and when a volcano is likely to erupt.</p>





<p>Muons are everywhere on Earth’s surface. They’re produced when high-energy particles from space, known as cosmic rays, crash into Earth’s atmosphere. Muons continuously shower down through the atmosphere at various angles. When they reach Earth’s surface, the particles tickle the insides of large structures like pyramids. They penetrate smaller stuff too: Your thumbnail is pierced by a muon about once a minute. Measuring how many of the particles are absorbed as they pass through a structure can reveal the density of an object, and expose any hidden gaps within.</p>



<p>The technique is reminiscent of taking an enormous X-ray image, says Mariaelena D’Errico, a particle physicist at the National Institute for Nuclear Physics in Naples, Italy, who studies Mount Vesuvius with muons. But “instead of X-rays, we use … a natural source of particles,” the Earth’s very own, never-ending supply of muons.</p>



<p>Physicists have typically studied cosmic rays to better understand the universe from whence they came. But muography turns this tradition on its head, using these cosmic particles to learn more about previously unknowable parts of our world. For the most part, says particle physicist Hiroyuki Tanaka of the University of Tokyo, “particles arriving from the universe have not been applied to our regular lives.” Tanaka and others are trying to change that.</p>

<h4>No particle like it</h4>



<p>Awkward cousins of electrons, muons may seem like an unnecessary oddity of physics. When the particle’s identity was first revealed, physicists wondered why the strange particle existed at all. While electrons play a crucial role in atoms, the heavier muons serve no such purpose.</p>



<p>But muons turn out to be ideal for making images of the interiors of large objects. A muon’s mass is about 207 times as large as an electron’s. That extra bulk means muons can traverse hundreds of meters of rock or more. The difference between an electron and a muon passing through matter is like the difference between a bullet and a cannonball, says particle physicist Cristina Cârloganu. A wall may stop a bullet, while a cannonball passes through.</p>



<p>Muons are plentiful, so there’s no need to create artificial beams of radiation, as required for taking X-ray images of broken bones in the doctor’s office, for example. Muons “are for free,” says Cârloganu, of CNRS and the National Institute of Nuclear and Particle Physics in Aubière, France.</p>

<h3>Particle shower&nbsp;</h3>



<p>Protons and other high-energy particles from space hit Earth’s atmosphere and generate a deluge of other particles. Pions and kaons can decay into muons, some of which reach Earth’s surface, along with difficult-to-detect neutrinos. </p>

<p>Another crucial upside of muons: “They’re also very easy to detect,” says nuclear physicist Richard Kouzes of the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory in Richland, Wash. A simple detector made of strips of plastic and light sensors will do the trick. Other muon detectors require little more than a specialized version of photographic film. There’s no other particle like it, Kouzes says.</p>



<p>Muons have a negative electric charge, like an electron. Their antiparticles, antimuons, which also shower down on Earth, have a positive charge. Muon detectors capture tracks of both negatively and positively charged varieties. When these particles pass through material, they lose energy in various ways, for example, by colliding with electrons and knocking them loose from their atoms.</p>



<p>With that energy loss, muons slow down, sometimes enough to stop. The denser the material, the fewer muons will make it through to a detector placed underneath or to the side of the material. So large, dense objects such as volcanoes or pyramids cast a muon shadow. And any gaps within those structures will appear as bright spots within that shadow, because more muons can slip through. Interpreting such dappled shadows can open a vista into hidden worlds.</p>



<h4>Probing pyramids</h4>



<p>Muography proved itself in a pyramid. One of the first uses of the technique was in the 1960s, when physicist Luis Alvarez and colleagues looked for hidden chambers in Khafre’s pyramid in Giza, a slightly smaller neighbor of the Great Pyramid. Detectors found no hint of unexpected rooms, but proved that the technique worked.</p>



<p>Still, the idea took time to take off, because muon detectors of the era tended to be bulky and worked best in well-controlled laboratory conditions. To spot the muons, Alvarez’s team used detectors called spark chambers. Spark chambers are filled with gas and metal plates under high voltage, so that charged particles passing through create trails of sparks.</p>



<p>Now, thanks to advances in particle physics technologies, spark chambers have largely been replaced. “We can make very compact, very sturdy detectors,” says nuclear physicist Edmundo Garcia-Solis of Chicago State University. Those detectors can be designed to work outside a carefully controlled lab.</p>



<p>One type of resilient detector is built with plastic <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/particle-detector-matter-subatomic-images-physics">containing a chemical called scintillator</a>, which releases light when a muon or other charged particle passes through (<em>SN Online: 8/5/21</em>). The light is then captured and measured by electronics. Later this year, physicists will <a href="http://journals.andromedapublisher.com/index.php/JAIS/article/view/240">use these detectors to take another look at Khafre’s pyramid</a>, Kouzes and colleagues reported February 23 in the <em>Journal for Advanced Instrumentation in Science</em>. Compact enough to fit within two large carrying cases, the detector “can be carried into the pyramid and then operated with a laptop and that’s all,” Kouzes says.</p>

<h3>A look inside&nbsp;</h3>



<p>Scientists placed three different types of muon detectors in and around the Great Pyramid to map out the density of the structure and search for hidden chambers.</p>

<p>A different but particularly low-maintenance type of detector, called a nuclear emulsion film, was crucial to uncovering the Great Pyramid’s hidden void in 2017. Nuclear emulsions record particle tracks in a special type of photographic film. The detectors are left in place for a period of time, then brought back to a lab for analysis of the tracks imprinted in them.</p>



<p>Particle physicist Kunihiro Morishima of Nagoya University in Japan helped discover the secret chamber through work on an international project called <a href="http://www.scanpyramids.org/">ScanPyramids</a>. “Nuclear emulsions are lightweight, compact and do not require a power supply,” he explains. That meant that multiple detectors could be placed in prime viewing locations in one of the pyramid’s rooms, the Queen’s Chamber, and a small niche next to it. The detectors’ measurements were supplemented with plastic scintillator detectors inside the Queen’s Chamber, and gas-based detectors outside the pyramid.</p>

<p>Since the discovery of the void, Morishima and colleagues have been taking additional measurements to better sketch out its properties. The team placed emulsion detectors in 20 locations in the pyramid, as well as gas detectors in several different spots. Using their new array of instruments, the researchers determined that the void is over 40 meters long. Its purpose is still unknown.</p>



<p>A more extensive survey of the Great Pyramid, placing much larger detectors outside the pyramid, is being planned by another team of researchers. The detectors will be periodically moved to <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.08184">measure muons from multiple angles</a>, the team reported March 6 in the<em> Journal for Advanced Instrumentation in Science</em>. The result, says co­author and particle physicist Alan Bross of Fermilab in Batavia, Ill., <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/ct-scan-50-years-anniversary-first-image-medicine-physics">will offer a 3-D view of what’s inside</a> (<em><em>SN: 12/18/21 &amp; 1/1/22, p. 44</em></em>).</p>



<p>Pyramids in other parts of the world are also getting closer scrutiny. Garcia-Solis and colleagues are now planning muography of the Maya pyramid known as El Castillo at Chichén Itzá in Mexico. Morishima and colleagues, as well, are planning work on Maya pyramids.</p>



<p>Scientists hope such studies might reveal new chambers, or features not visible with other techniques for peering inside of objects. Ultrasound, ground-penetrating radar or X-rays, for example, can only penetrate a short distance from the surface, Bross explains. Muons, on the other hand, give an in-depth picture. For studying pyramids, Bross says, “muons really are ideal.”</p>



<h4>Peering inside a volcano</h4>



<p>Vesuvius is a known menace in Naples and the surrounding municipalities that snuggle up against the volcano’s flanks. Infamous for destroying the ancient city of Pompeii in A.D. 79, the volcano has been quiescent since 1944, when <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/mount-vesuvius-suffocated-not-vaporized-some-victims">a major eruption destroyed several nearby villages</a> (<em>SN: 2/29/20, p. 5</em>). But if it erupted, it would endanger the lives of roughly 600,000 people who live closest to it, and many others in the vicinity.</p>



<p>“Vesuvius always scared me,” D’Errico says. “I was born and I live under this volcano.” Now, as part of the Muon Radiography of Vesuvius experiment, or MURAVES, she seeks to better understand the volcano and its dangers.</p>

<p>Using muon detectors 1.5 kilometers from the volcano’s crater, the team is mapping out muon densities — and thus rock densities — at the top of Vesuvius’ cone. In a paper posted February 24 at arXiv.org, the researchers presented <a href="https://indico.cern.ch/event/1033631/contributions/4529056/">preliminary hints of density differences</a> between the volcano’s northwestern and southeastern halves. MURAVES is still collecting data; future observations should help scientists understand finer details of the volcano’s internal structure, which is thought to be layered due to repeated eruptions.</p>



<p>Information about a volcano’s structure can help scientists predict what hazards to expect in an eventual eruption, such as where landslides might occur. And that could help scientists know what steps to take to reduce risks to people living nearby, says Cârloganu, who studied the dormant volcano Puy de Dôme near Clermont-Ferrand, France, with muography and is now working to image the aptly named island of Vulcano in Italy.</p>



<p>When Mount St. Helens in Washington erupted in 1980, for example, an entire flank of the volcano collapsed. The disaster killed 57 people and caused widespread damage. Knowing where a volcano’s structural weaknesses lie could help scientists better predict how an eruption might play out, and what areas sit inside the danger zone, Cârloganu says.</p>



<p>Cârloganu thinks muons will be useful for pointing out structural weaknesses, but not for giving a warning when the volcano is going to blow. Other researchers are more optimistic about muons’ capability for giving timely forewarnings.</p>



<p>Muography is ripe for <a href="https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rspa.2021.0320">inclusion in volcano early-warning systems</a>, Leone, Tanaka and colleagues wrote last November in <em>Proceedings of the Royal Society A.</em> But more work needs to be done to integrate muography with other established methods that help warn of an upcoming eruption, Leone says. These methods include seismic measurements, as well as observations of ground deformation and volcanic gas emissions.</p>



<p>Tanaka and colleagues are studying Sakurajima, one of the most active volcanoes in the world, near Kagoshima, Japan. One of the volcano’s craters, the Showa crater, erupted frequently until 2017 when the activity abruptly shifted to another crater, Minamidake. Comparing muography data taken before and after this shift revealed that <a href="https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1029/2019GL084784">a new, dense region had formed below the Showa crater</a>, Tanaka and colleagues reported in 2019 in <em>Geophysical Research Letters</em>. That hints at the reason Showa’s eruptions stopped: It was clogged with a dense plug of solidified magma, Tanaka says.</p>

<p>These results suggest that scientists can use muography to help predict volcanic eruptions, Tanaka says. In fact, using deep learning techniques on the muography data from Sakurajima, Tanaka and colleagues reported in <em>Scientific Reports</em> in 2020 that they were able to predict whether the volcano would erupt the next day, by analyzing the previous week’s data. The technique correctly predicted eruption days of the volcano more than 72 percent of the time, and correctly predicted non-eruption days more than 85 percent of the time.</p>



<p>Just as the discovery of X-rays unveiled a whole new way of seeing the world, harnessing muons could change our perspective on our surroundings. Attitudes toward a particle once thought to be unnecessary — unwanted and unloved by physicists — have been transformed. One day, perhaps, muons could save lives.</p>

<h3>Contraband revealed</h3>



<p>Superman’s X-ray vision was impressive. But some scientists might prefer muon vision. For example, muons could help officials peer inside closed shipping containers “to see if there is something suspicious inside,” says particle physicist Andrea Giammanco of the Université Catholique de Louvain in Belgium. A European Union–funded project called <a href="https://silentborder.eu/">Silent Border</a> aims to develop a method to uncover dangerous contraband at customs checkpoints without having to physically open and inspect every container that passes through.</p>



<p>The key to this technique is measuring how muons scatter. When muons pass through a material, some are absorbed and some scatter, changing direction. Using detectors above and below an object, scientists can observe how a muon’s trajectory changes as it passes through the object. Since muons tend to scatter away at larger angles in materials made of heavier elements, this technique can reveal substances such as uranium.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/covid-coronavirus-rapid-test-at-home-positive-cases">What experts told me to do after my positive COVID-19 at-home test</a></h4>

              
                <p>After two years of successfully evading getting COVID-19 — including a few brushes with close contacts, a couple of<em> are-they-just-colds?</em> scares and lots of negative tests — I recently tested positive.</p>



<p>It felt both inevitable and shocking. I somehow avoided testing positive during the omicron surge that infected most of my friends this winter, so I figured that either I was invincible or I was next. Staring at my at-home rapid antigen test, I had to acknowledge that the long game of high-stakes tag was finally over. I was now “it.”</p>



<p>COVID-19 snuck up on me when I least expected it. Cases are low where I live in Queens, N.Y. And riding the subway felt low risk thanks to the federal public transit mask mandate. (A federal judge struck down the mandate on April 18, although the Biden administration announced April 20 it would appeal the ruling and some places, including New York City, are keeping masking requirements in place for the time being.) I had dined indoors, but I <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/covid-coronavirus-mask-guidelines-community-risk">still wore my mask</a> inside public spaces (<em>SN: 3/25/22</em>). So when I woke up with a sore throat on a Wednesday, I chalked it up to needing more sleep. Before I tested Friday evening, I was still convinced it was just another cold.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Two thick lines on my <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coronavirus-covid-19-testing-questions-vaccines-variants-accuracy">rapid test</a> said otherwise (<em>SN: 12/17/21</em>). OK, I thought, I definitely have COVID. Now what?</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img data-attachment-id="3113081" data-permalink="https://www.sciencenews.org/042022_ag_covid-test_inline" data-orig-file="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/042022_AG_covid-test_inline.jpg" data-orig-size="680,383" data-comments-opened="0" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="042022_AG_covid-test_inline" data-image-description="" data-image-caption="&lt;p&gt;These are my results the day I tested positive for COVID-19.

Gibbs</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>I had a pretty good idea of the first few steps, which had been drilled into my head ad nauseam: Isolate immediately. Text close contacts from the 48 hours before first symptoms. Stay away from other people and pets in the house.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It got blurrier from there. Since I tested myself at home, my COVID-19 test wasn’t official. Surely I should report my positive test; after all, public health regulations are often based on case numbers. But it turns out that playing my part was a lot harder than I would have thought. </p>





<p>When it comes to reporting at-home tests, “there is no formal recommendation,” says Autumn Gertz, an epidemiologist at Boston Children’s Hospital who works on COVID-19 surveillance. Without a federal program for reporting at-home tests, states are left to their own devices, and it’s confusing to make sense of where to report, which means that many people won’t.&nbsp;</p>

<p>That’s problematic: Now that at-home tests are <a href="https://www.covid.gov/tests">free and easy to access</a>, at-home testing is becoming increasingly common. Gertz and colleagues are tracking at-home testing trends and say they have noticed <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/71/wr/mm7113e1.htm?s_cid=mm7113e1_w">a gradual increase in their use to detect COVID-19</a>. In the coming weeks, Gertz says they expect 50 percent of people who get COVID-19 to find out from an at-home test.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Cases being underreported is nothing new. Even early on, asymptomatic and mild cases where the person never got tested wouldn’t make the case count. But at-home testing will make underreporting even more prevalent. The Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation’s data show that <a href="https://yourlocalepidemiologist.substack.com/p/state-of-affairs-can-we-trust-case?s=r">only an estimated 7 percent of all U.S. COVID-19 cases are being reported</a>, Katelyn Jetelina, an epidemiologist at the University of Texas in Dallas who writes the Your Local Epidemiologist newsletter, reports April 13 in a post titled “Can we trust case numbers?”&nbsp;</p>



<p>To make my case count, I donned two KN95 masks and walked to the COVID-19 testing booth on my street to get a PCR test that would be officially reported. (An official PCR test result may also be necessary for insurance coverage in cases that require medical care.) The downside is that I was contagious so there was a risk of exposing others to the virus, though I was masked for all but the swab. An alternative, Gertz suggests, is reporting your positive at-home test to a primary care provider. Some at-home test manufacturers also provide information about how to report results from that test.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But until public health reporting catches up with the quick transition to at-home testing, we’re flying blind. There are ways to find clues about what’s going on in your community, though.&nbsp;</p>



<p>For starters, become familiar with your local public health department website, says epidemiologist Michael Mina, the chief science officer at eMed, a company developing a system for at-home test reporting. Check to see if your community <a href="https://biobot.io/data/">monitors wastewater</a>, which is a better way to track the amount of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, in communities than case numbers or hospitalizations. <a href="https://outbreaksnearme.org/us/en-US">Outbreaks Near Me</a>, a project Gertz works on, also collects results from volunteers to help track COVID-19 trends down to the local level.</p>





<p>In general, “be aware, and try to keep your eyes open for signals,” Mina says. That includes not discounting anecdotes: “If you start to hear, like, ‘Hey, you know, I&#8217;ve had a bunch of friends who are positive lately,’ that&#8217;s probably a really good indicator … that there&#8217;s a lot of COVID happening in our community right now.” And that it’s a good time to start taking extra precautions again.</p>



<p>Speaking of precautions, according to the <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/your-health/quarantine-isolation.html">isolation guidelines</a> put out by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, I could have returned to the world without a mask on the 10th day after my symptoms started. But I learned from Mina that you can <a href="https://coviddatadispatch.com/2022/04/17/the-cdcs-isolation-guidance-is-not-based-on-data/">still be contagious</a> after 10 days. So how do I know if I can still infect others?&nbsp;</p>



<p>Turns out it’s a complicated question. There’s no magic number of days in which all people will no longer be contagious. And you can still have symptoms and not be contagious, and vice versa. But rapid at-home tests are a great indicator — albeit imperfect — of current contagiousness. (That’s unlike PCR tests, which are extremely sensitive to any remaining virus in your system long after you stop shedding it.)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>How contagious a person is roughly relates to their viral load, or how many virus particles they have in their body. Early research suggested that the viral load of SARS-CoV-2 is at its highest just before or when symptoms emerge and then rapidly declines after onset of symptoms. That data informed the CDC’s decision to cut its isolation recommendation from 10 days to five days.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But several recent studies suggest that people infected during the recent COVID-19 surge continue to be contagious after five days. A preprint that studied omicron infections in NBA players found that, after five days of symptoms,<a href="https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.01.13.22269257v1"> about half of the players still showed significant viral load</a>. In another preprint, Mina and researchers at the University of Chicago found that <a href="https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.02.01.22269931v1">43 percent of rapid tests from 260 vaccinated health care workers were still positive</a> between five and 10 days after their symptoms appeared. Both studies have yet to be peer-reviewed.</p>



<aside class="wp-block-sciencenews-inline-related-post">
<h4>
<a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/editors-picks/2019-novel-coronavirus-outbreak">See all our coverage of the coronavirus outbreak</a>
</h4>
</aside>



<p>“This isn&#8217;t like a small fraction of people who are still positive and infectious at five days,” Mina says. One possible explanation for these observations is that people who are vaccinated or have been previously infected have a quicker immune system response to the virus. So initial symptoms are caused by your immune response, not a high viral load, which comes later. “I would highly, highly, highly recommend people not listen to the five-day-to-exit-isolation recommendation,” Mina says. “That was based on old data.”</p>



<p>Instead, experts say, the best way to figure out whether you’re contagious after day five is by taking a rapid at-home test, which measures the amount of viral proteins in your system in real time. You can even get a sense of how infectious you are by the intensity of the positive line on your test, and the speed at which it develops. If your positive line appears quickly, chances are you have an extremely high viral load. If it takes most of the allotted test time and the line is faint, there’s likely less virus in your body.</p>



<p>But because it takes a lot of virus for the tests to turn positive, &#8220;you should assume that you&#8217;re infectious&#8221; if any line shows up, Mina says. Even after you’ve tested negative (twice, if possible), still avoid high-risk activities, like visiting an elderly relative.</p>



<p>By my 12th day in, my symptoms were mostly gone but for a lingering cough and a new proclivity for napping. But I was still testing positive on my rapid test, even though the line was much fainter than it used to be.</p>



<p>I wish there was an on-off switch. But, like with most things in this pandemic, it’s a squishy gray area. For all the public health recommendations, personal navigation of this virus comes down to individual everyday decisions. We hold a lot of power, and often, it feels like, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coronavirus-covid-moral-judgment-activity-risk-behavior-bias">not enough knowledge</a> to make such decisions (<em>SN: 6/16/21</em>).&nbsp;</p>



<p>“It&#8217;s OK to be confused about all this,” Mina says. “I think a lot of people feel isolated right now and feel confused by this pandemic.” Even doctors have a hard time keeping up with the nuances and changes, he adds.</p>



<p>As for me, I finally tested negative 14 days after my symptoms started. Given Mina’s advice on testing negative twice, I’m still going to be careful, but I feel a little safer now.</p>

                <p><em>By</em> <a href="https://emmayoung.net/">Emma Young</a></p>



<p>Have you ever believed someone to be decent — but then they did something morally bad, which turned that belief on its head? It happens more often than we might think. And, according to <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/19485506221076685">new work</a> in <em>Social Psychology and Personality Science</em>, the consequences are far-reaching.</p>



<span id="more-46055"></span>



<p>In two initial studies, Kate W. Guan and Steven J. Heine at the University of British Columbia recruited online participants who reported having had this type of experience. After reporting details about the event and the perpetrator, participants answered a series of questions about how they felt before, during and after it happened. These questions probed their perceptions of the perpetrator’s character, their general beliefs about the world and other people, and confidence in their ability to judge character.</p>



<p>The results suggest that the experience of a “good” person doing something immoral is so unsettling, it makes us doubt our ability to judge character and also makes the world feel like a more confusing place. The starker the contrast between the participants&#8217; impressions of the perpetrator’s moral character before versus after their bad behaviour, the bigger the dent in their sense of being able to comprehend the world and their place in it. In the second study (though not the first), Guan and Heine also found that this experience leads people to a dimmer view of the moral character of people in general.</p>



<p>The researchers also report that some people were more affected in this way than others. Those who reported liking closure in life — who find it hard to tolerate uncertain situations — and those who felt that a person’s moral character is fundamental and unchanging reported the biggest shifts in their own attitudes.</p>



<p>However, in these studies, the participants had to think back into the past, and try to recall how they felt at various points. This experimental approach is notoriously vulnerable to mis-remembering. So the researchers then attempted a more real-time investigation.</p>



<p>A fresh group of 446 online participants imagined meeting a new person. Some were told that this person seemed “like a kind and likeable person” who was “objectively caring, helpful and upstanding”; others were told that they seemed “like an unkind and dislikable person”, who was “objectively selfish, cruel and hateful”. The participants then read about this person doing something bad — either engaging in hate speech or committing domestic abuse. Finally, they answered questions about how this information would influence their own beliefs and perceptions, similar to those in the first studies.</p>



<p>The researchers report that those who’d been led to believe that the person was kind and likeable reported a bigger threat to their sense of meaning in the world, as well as to their confidence in judging character — and to their moral impressions of other people, in general. It’s notable that a shift from good-to-bad had a bigger negative impact on the participants than a bad person engaging in another example of bad behaviour, the researchers write. But there is an obvious weakness to this study too — the participants only <em>imagined </em>how they’d feel; perhaps they’d feel differently in real life. </p>



<p>If we set the various limitations of this study aside, why <em>should</em> witnessing someone going from &#8220;good&#8221; to &#8220;bad&#8221; have a bigger impact?</p>



<p>The pair’s pretty convincing argument is that we feel a strong need to work other people out. To succeed in a social environment, we really need to know if another person is likely to be a trustworthy, helpful ally — or a threat.</p>



<p>Of course countless books, TV series and movies that grip us do so because they on play on this drive. I<em>s</em> a character really a goodie or a baddie? The more we are made unsure, the more we just <em>have </em>to know, and we keep reading or binge-watching. It makes sense, then, that moral character violations should make us reconsider our ability to judge others, and make us more cautious. Guan and Heine conclude: “The present findings advance a novel reason why people may bemoan such experiences. They threaten a core way in which we make sense of our social landscapes.”</p>

                <p>At the <a class="reference external" href="https://ocns.github.io/SoftwareWG/2022/04/21/wg-meeting-11-april-2022.html">meeting in April</a>, members of the working group discussed how we can make it easier for us to keep up with the activities of the working group.
While we do use <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/OCNS/SoftwareWG/issues">GitHub tickets</a> and receive notifications from GitHub for these, given that a lot of working group members have many many projects/repositories on GitHub makes these notifications quite noisy.
This makes it easy for us to miss notifications related to the working group&#8217;s&nbsp;repository.</p>
<p>So, we agreed that a mailing list for announcements is the best way to go.
Malin was kind enough to set up a mailing list for us on the <a class="reference external" href="https://lists.incf.org/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo"><span class="caps">INCF</span> Mailman instance</a>.
You can subscribe to it here: <a class="reference external" href="https://lists.incf.org/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/incf-ocns-software-wg">https://lists.incf.org/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/incf-ocns-software-wg</a>  and mail to it at <code>incf-ocns-software-wg AT incf.org</code>.</p>
<p>This mailing list does not replace our GitHub tickets for discussion.
GitHub tickets work very well for us because they allow us to organise and assign tasks to ourselves using all of GitHub&#8217;s features.
Instead, this new mailing list is for announcements only.
All announcements for events, or tickets that need input from working group members and the community will be sent here.
This should ensure that everyone only has one well established channel of communication that needs to be monitored for working group&nbsp;updates.</p>
<p>Please subscribe to the mailing list (and join&nbsp;us!).</p>

<p>Founded three decades ago, <a href="https://arxiv.org/">arXiv</a> is now home to more than 2 million open access scholarly articles by researchers in disciplines ranging from computer science to economics.</p>
<p>With its ambitious mission to provide an open platform where researchers can share and discover new, relevant, and emerging science, arXiv’s popularity has continued to grow in recent years. In fact, in many fields of mathematics and physics, the majority of scientific papers are posted on arXiv prior to their publication in a peer-reviewed journal.</p>
<p>arXiv is hosted at Cornell University, with financial support from the Simons Foundation, other donors, and more than 200 <a href="https://arxiv.org/about/ourmembers">member institutions</a>.</p>
<p>New among the membership benefits that all institutions receive, is access to a personalized digital dashboard, containing an overview of the articles their researchers have posted on the platform. This is the first time submission data by institution &#8212; including subject category breakdown – has been offered to arXiv members.</p>
<p>To provide this information, arXiv is partnering with <a href="https://www.scopus.com/home.uri">Scopus</a> to optimize that publication data and increase institution’s visibility of their researcher contributions.</p>
<p>Updated annually, the dashboards will help institutions build a more holistic picture of the research activities taking place across their campuses. Institutions will be better able to track changes in their institution’s research outputs posted to arXiv, identifying arXiv usage in different subject categories over time.</p>
<p>For institutions, particularly librarians, this level of detail and transparency has multiple benefits. The insights can be used to understand and report on progress towards open access and other key strategic goals. They can also be used to inform future planning. Importantly, arXiv helps institutions fulfill their mission of expanding access to scholarship.</p>
<p>Alison Fromme, arXiv’s Community Engagement Manager commented: &#8220;Our member institutions value learning about their contributions to arXiv. It helps them understand how their researchers are contributing to the world of research, and how their institutions are contributing to the wider body of scholarly knowledge.&#8221;</p>
<p>Elsevier’s Iana Tsandev, Director of Product Management, commented: “The quality, breadth and reliability of Scopus data, combined with its transparent structure, has already seen some of the world’s leading university ranking organizations use Scopus data in their calculations. We are really delighted that we now have this opportunity to share our data with arXiv for this important project valuable collaboration.”</p>

<h2><strong>Submission Data FAQ</strong></h2>
<p><strong>What usage data is available publicly?</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://arxiv.org/about/reports/2021_institution_submissions">Worldwide submission rank by organization is available here</a> (3-year average rank, 2019-2021). <a href="https://arxiv.org/about/reports">Other publicly available information can be found here</a> and <a href="https://arxiv.org/stats/main">additional usage information here</a>.</p>
<p><strong>How can I find my institution’s submission statistics?</strong></p>
<p>Submission statistics are available to the member representatives of active arXiv member institutions and consortia. Emails with password protected links will be sent to each member representative by the end of April 2022. If you are a member representative at an active member organization and you did not receive your link, please contact <a href="mailto:membership@arXiv.org">membership@arXiv.org</a>. Not a member yet? <a href="https://arxiv.org/about/membership">Learn about membership here</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Where does this data originate? </strong></p>
<p>Submission data by institution was provided by <a href="https://www.elsevier.com/solutions/scopus">Scopus</a>, the curated abstract and citation database operated by Elsevier, extracting and disambiguating author and organization metadata from articles. Our member dashboards were created by connecting disambiguated authors and organizations to arXiv subject areas.</p>
<p><strong>I notice my institution’s submission data is different from the data released in 2020. Why?</strong></p>
<p>Last year’s submission count data was based on a different data source, Microsoft Academic Graph. When the service was discontinued in 2021, we collaborated with <a href="https://www.scopus.com/home.uri">Scopus</a> to use their submission count.</p>
<p><strong>Can I see a list of papers submitted by authors from my institution?</strong></p>
<p>At this time, this information is only available to Champion members. To learn more about becoming a Champion member, please see our <a href="https://arxiv.org/about/membership">membership information</a> or contact <a href="mailto:membership@arXiv.org">membership@arXiv.org</a></p>
<p><strong>Are download statistics for my institution available?</strong></p>
<p>arXiv provides <a href="https://arxiv.org/stats/main">general download counts</a> but no longer provides download statistics by institution. This decision was made in collaboration with the Member Advisory Board after careful consideration. Like many people around the world, arXiv readers and authors began working from home during the pandemic – so download statistics by institution, formerly estimated by institutions’ IP addresses, no longer represented the full value institutions gain from arXiv. At the same time, our members began asking for submission statistics, and our collaboration with Scopus enabled us to provide that information in a cost effective manner. Submission statistics help provide a snapshot of arXiv’s value to institutions. Of course, arXiv’s true value to the research community remains incalculable!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><em>Additional information added on April 25, 2022:</em></strong></p>
<p><b>Why is it necessary to capture submission data? </b></p>
<p>arXiv provides usage data to member institutions as a member benefit so that they can better understand the value of arXiv to their researchers. Usage data is a component of <a href="https://arxiv.org/about/membership">arXiv’s membership program</a>, which provides approximately 30% of arXiv’s budget.</p>
<p><b>How will this data help librarians and institutions?</b></p>
<p>The data will help librarians understand the research activities taking place across their campuses. Institutions will be better able to track changes in their institution’s research outputs posted to arXiv, identifying arXiv usage in different subject categories over time. The insights can be used to report on progress towards open access and other key strategic goals. They can also inform future planning.</p>
<p><b>Will the changes impact researchers’ ability to upload or access research?</b></p>
<p>Open access to research is and always will be central to arXiv’s mission and researchers&#8217; experience reading and submitting articles remains the same.</p>
<p><b>Why was Scopus selected to provide submission data?</b></p>
<p>In 2020, arXiv members requested submission data for their institutions, and in 2021, we used Microsoft Academic Graph to provide that data. When MAG was deprecated, we searched for other solutions that could provide data by early 2022.</p>
<p>Scopus’ use of disambiguation and linking technology provided arXiv with a structure capable of quickly building reliable reports for members.<a href="https://www.elsevier.com/?a=1214537"> Learn more about Scopus organization profiles here</a>.</p>
<p><b>Does this mean that Scopus has privileged access to arXiv?</b></p>
<p>No. Scopus uses <a href="https://arxiv.org/help/api/index">arXiv&#8217;s open APIs</a> and then processes the data and returns it to arXiv for free.</p>
<p>This once-a-year service is a contribution that recognizes the value of arXiv to the researcher community, and aims to help members understand the value of arXiv. Scopus has agreed to provide this data for 3 years.</p>
<p><b>Is arXiv’s commitment to openness changing?</b></p>
<p>arXiv remains committed, as ever, to openness. This contribution from Scopus does not impact our commitment to our members and our mission to serve researchers.</p>

<ul class="simple">
<li>We don&#8217;t currently have a way of actively communicating with the <span class="caps">WG</span> membership because we don&#8217;t have a mailing list sort of thing where any announcements go straight to the members&#8217; inboxes (we don&#8217;t even have all your e-mails because we decided not to use mailing lists when we&nbsp;started).</li>
<li>The worry, however, is that using GitHub tickets/discussions is passive&#8212;-i.e., folks do get notifications, but they still need to come up to the repository to&nbsp;engage.</li>
<li>The lack of something like a mailing list also means that we don&#8217;t have a way of actively informing the community (outside our membership) of our&nbsp;activities.</li>
</ul>
<p>So:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Do we need a better way of keeping the wg membership in the loop? Are you satisfied with our current way of doing&nbsp;things?</li>
<li>Are fixed meeting slots working? (we&#8217;ve had a lower than usual turnout recently&#8212;-what can we do to help more of our members attend&nbsp;meetings?)</li>
</ul>
<p>For communicating with the research&nbsp;community:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Should we send more updates to the already existing mailing lists (for example, should a note of our meeting be sent&nbsp;there?)</li>
<li>Or do we need a new mailing list/newsletter setup that folks can subscribe to? (in case our frequent posts to already existing mailing lists are thought to be an abuse of their&nbsp;policies?)</li>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/pregnancy-medication-new-drugs-research-clinical-trials">Why taking medications during pregnancy is so confusing</a></h4>

              
                <p class="has-drop-cap" style="font-size:20px">Obstetrician Cynthia Gyamfi-Bannerman was treating patients in New York City when the COVID-19 pandemic swept in. Hospitals began filling up. Some of her pregnant patients were among the sick.</p>



<p>It was a terrifying time. Little was known about the virus called SARS-CoV-2 to begin with, much less how it might affect a pregnancy, so doctors had to make tough calls. Gyamfi-Bannerman remembers doctors getting waivers to administer the antiviral drug remdesivir to pregnant COVID-19 patients, for instance, even though the drug hadn’t been tested during pregnancy.</p>



<p>“Our goal is to help the mom,” she says. “If we had something that might save her life — or she might die — we were 100 percent using all of those medications.”</p>





<p>These life-or-death decisions were very familiar to obstetricians even before the pandemic. Pregnant women have long been excluded from most drug testing to avoid risk to the fetus. As a result, there’s little data on whether many medications are safe to take while pregnant. This means tough choices for the roughly <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3793635/">80 percent of women</a> who will take at least one medication during pregnancy. Some have serious conditions that can be dangerous for both mother and fetus if left untreated, like high blood pressure or diabetes.</p>



<p>“Pregnant women are essentially like everybody else,” Gyamfi-Bannerman says. They have the same underlying conditions, requiring the same drugs. In a 2013 study, the top 20 prescriptions taken during the first trimester included <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3996804/">antibiotics, asthma and allergy drugs, metformin for diabetes, and antidepressants</a>. Yet even for common drugs, the only advice available if you’re pregnant is “talk to your doctor.” With no data, doctors don’t have the answers either.</p>

<p>What’s frustrating to many doctors and researchers is that this lack of information is by design. Even the later stages of most clinical trials, which test a new drug’s safety and efficacy in people, specifically exclude pregnant people to avoid risk to the fetus. But in the wake of a pandemic that disproportionately harmed the pregnant population, researchers are questioning more than ever whether this is the best approach.</p>



<p>Typically, researchers have to justify excluding certain groups, such as older adults, from clinical trials in which they might benefit. “You never have to justify why you’re excluding pregnant people,” says Gyamfi-Bannerman, who now heads the obstetrics, gynecology and reproductive science department at the University of California, San Diego. “You can just go ahead and exclude them.</p>



<p>“The exclusion of pregnant people in clinical trials is a huge, historic problem,” she says, “and it really came to light with COVID.”</p>



<h4>Pregnant in a crisis</h4>



<p>Teresa Mathews was 43 years old when she found out she was pregnant in June 2020, just as the pandemic was tearing across the United States. “I was really worried,” she says. In addition to her age as a risk factor, Mathews has sickle cell trait, meaning she carries one defective gene copy that makes her prone to anemia and shortness of breath. COVID-19 also causes shortness of breath, so Mathews feared her unborn child could starve for oxygen if she caught the virus.</p>



<p>What’s more, the baby would be her first. “I don’t want to say it melodramatically, but it was my last chance of having a baby, right? So I didn’t really want to take chances.” She went into full lockdown for the rest of her pregnancy.</p>



<p>For good reason. A study during the pandemic’s first year in England found that pregnant women who got the virus were about <a href="https://www.ajog.org/article/S0002-9378(21)00565-2/fulltext">twice as likely to have a stillbirth or early birth</a>. And the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported in November 2020 that pregnant women are about <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/being-pregnant-unvaccinated-against-covid-19-risky">three times as likely as other women to land in intensive care with COVID-19</a>, and 70 percent more likely to die from the infection (<em>SN Online: 2/7/22</em>).</p>



<div class="wp-block-sciencenews-content-sidebar alignwide">
<h3>Heightened risk&nbsp;</h3>



<p>Shown are admissions to hospital intensive care units during the pandemic. Unvaccinated pregnant women are about three times as likely as pregnant women who’ve been vaccinated to require intensive care for COVID-19. </p>

<p>So when the race for a vaccine began, many doctors and officials hoped that vaccines would be tested in pregnant women and shown to be safe. There were promising signs: The U.S. Food and Drug Administration <a href="https://www.fda.gov/media/139638/download">encouraged</a> vaccine developers to <a href="https://www.fda.gov/news-events/fda-voices/global-regulators-envision-paradigm-shift-toward-inclusion-pregnant-and-breastfeeding-women-clinical">include pregnant women in their trials</a>. A large body of previous research suggested that risks would be low for vaccines like those for COVID-19, which do not contain live viruses.</p>



<p>But ultimately the three vaccines that the FDA cleared for use in the United States, from Pfizer/BioNTech, Moderna and Johnson &amp; Johnson, excluded pregnant people from their initial clinical trials. After its vaccine was authorized for emergency use in December 2020, Pfizer began enrolling pregnant women for a clinical trial but called it off when federal officials recommended that all pregnant women get vaccinated. The company cited challenges with enrolling enough women for the trial, as well as ethical considerations in giving a placebo to pregnant individuals once the vaccine was recommended.</p>



<p>When pregnant people were excluded from vaccine trials, doctors knew it would be difficult to convince pregnant patients to take a vaccine that hadn’t been tested during pregnancy.</p>



<p>Mathews says she would have been willing to get vaccinated while pregnant if there had been data to support the decision. But the choice was made for her. Her daughter, Eulalia, was born healthy in February 2021, shortly before the vaccines became available to all adults in Mathews’ hometown of Knoxville, Tenn. At that point, there was still no clear guidance on whether to get vaccinated while pregnant or nursing.</p>





<p>Officials at the National Institutes of Health in Bethesda, Md., were worried about that lack of direction. Diana Bianchi, director of the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development, called for <a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2776540">more COVID-19 vaccine research in the pregnant population</a> in a February 2021 commentary in <em>JAMA</em>. She wrote, “Pregnant people and their clinicians must make real-time decisions based on little or no scientific evidence.”</p>



<p>Meanwhile, social media and pregnancy websites filled the void with conspiracy theories and scary stories about vaccines causing infertility or miscarriages. Alarmed, the <a href="https://www.acog.org/news/news-articles/2021/10/covid-19-vaccination-pregnancy-medical-misinformation-how-you-can-help">American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists warned last October</a> that “the spread of misinformation and mistrust in doctors and science is contributing to staggeringly low vaccination rates among pregnant people.”</p>



<p>Indeed, the CDC had issued an urgent health advisory the month before warning that only <a href="https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#vaccinations-pregnant-women">31 percent of pregnant people were fully vaccinated</a>, compared with about <a href="https://usafacts.org/visualizations/covid-vaccine-tracker-states/">56 percent of the general population</a>. (CDC and many experts favor “pregnant people” as a general term. <em>Science News </em>is following the language used by sources, and refers to pregnant women when a study population was designated as such.)</p>



<p>“Every week, I look at the number of pregnant people who have died due to COVID. Right now, the most recent statistic is 257 deaths,” Bianchi said in January. “I look at that and I say, that was a preventable statistic.”</p>



<p>After the vaccines received emergency use authorization, the CDC analyzed the outcomes for nearly 2,500 vaccinated pregnant people and found no safety concerns related to pregnancy. The agency <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/media/releases/2021/s0811-vaccine-safe-pregnant.html">recommended vaccination for anyone who is pregnant, lactating or considering becoming pregnant</a>. But that recommendation arrived more than six months after the first vaccine became available.</p>

</div>



<p>Since then, the vaccines have also proved to be highly effective in pregnancy. <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-021-01666-2">More than 98 percent of COVID-19 critical care admissions in a group of more than 130,000 pregnant women in Scotland were unvaccinated</a>, researchers reported in January in <em>Nature Medicine</em>. And all of the infants who died had unvaccinated moms.</p>



<p>“The story of COVID is yet another cautionary tale,” says Anne Lyerly, a bioethicist at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill who trained as an obstetrician and gynecologist. “It highlighted what we’re up against.” Researchers have an ethical duty, she says, not only to protect fetuses from the potential risks of research, but also to ensure that “the drugs that go on the market are safe and effective for all the people who will take them.”</p>



<h4>Good intentions</h4>



<p>Increasingly, scientists are questioning what Gyamfi-Bannerman calls a “knee-jerk” tendency to exclude pregnant individuals from clinical trials. In 2009, Lyerly and colleagues formed the <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-021-01666-2">Second Wave Initiative</a> to promote ethical ways to include pregnant women in research. As their ideas have spread, more researchers — <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2747530/">mostly women — have held conferences and spearheaded research</a>. Collectively, they’re pushing back on the prevailing culture “that pregnant people need to be protected<em> from</em> research instead of protected <em>through </em>research,” Bianchi says.</p>



<p>“We got here with good intentions,” says Brookie Best, a clinical pharmacologist at UC San Diego who studies medication use among pregnant people. “There were some terrible, terrible tragedies of pregnant people taking a drug and having bad outcomes.”</p>



<p>The most famous of these was thalidomide. Starting in the late 1950s, the drug was prescribed for morning sickness, but it had never been tested in pregnant people. By the early 1960s, it became clear that it <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/deformed-babies-born-result-sedative">caused birth defects including missing or malformed limbs</a> (<em>SN: 7/14/62, p. 22</em>). Afterward, drug companies were reluctant to take on the risk, or legal liability, of potential birth defects. While the FDA enacted new safety rules in response to the thalidomide disaster, the agency did not require testing during pregnancy before drugs went to market.</p>



<p>In 1977, the FDA recommended the <a href="https://orwh.od.nih.gov/toolkit/recruitment/history">exclusion of all women of childbearing age from the first two phases of clinical trials</a>. When the U.S. Congress passed a bill in 1993 requiring that women and minorities be included in clinical research, the requirement did not extend to pregnant women.</p>

<p>Some scientists still see plenty of good reasons not to include pregnant women in clinical trials. For example, reproductive epidemiologist Shanna Swan has seen unexpected health effects crop up long after substances were deemed safe. With that in mind, Swan, of the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai in New York City, says that observational studies that follow women and their children after a drug has been approved remain the best approach. These studies are “expensive, and very slow,” she admits, but safer.</p>



<p>For decades, that level of precaution has extended to essentially all medications. As a result, the reproductive effects of a medicine aren’t usually discovered until long after a drug enters the market. Even then, such research is not required for most new drugs, so doctors and researchers must take the initiative. Typically, this happens through pregnancy registries, which enroll pregnant volunteers who are taking a particular drug and follow them throughout pregnancy or beyond.</p>



<p>But voluntary registries leave huge data gaps. A 2011 <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ajmg.c.30313">review of 172 drugs approved by the FDA in the preceding decade</a> found that the risk of harm to fetal development was “undetermined” for 98 percent of them, and for 73 percent there was no safety data during pregnancy at all.</p>



<p>That doesn’t mean all those drugs are dangerous. Relatively few drugs cause major birth defects, and many of those fall into known classes. For example, <a href="https://www.webmd.com/women/news/20060607/ace-inhibitors-may-boost-birth-defects">ACE inhibitors used to control blood pressure have been linked to a range of issues</a>, including kidney and cardiovascular problems in infants, when taken during pregnancy. But the potential for more subtle, long-term effects has been trickier to tease out.</p>



<p>For instance, several studies in the 2010s reported links between mothers taking antidepressants during pregnancy and their kids having developmental problems like attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder and autism spectrum disorder. Some moms became afraid to treat their own depression. But in 2017, studies of siblings <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/autism-adhd-risk-not-linked-prenatal-exposure-antidepressants">found no difference</a> in these conditions among children who had been exposed to antidepressants in the womb and those who had not (<em>SN: 5/13/17, p. 9</em>). More likely, the problem was the depression the mom was experiencing, the studies suggested, not the drugs.</p>



<h4>No legal requirement</h4>



<p>How the contents of a pregnant woman’s medicine cabinet might affect her child depends on a host of factors, including how the drug works and whether it crosses the placenta. The main way to gauge whether a drug may harm a fetus is through animal studies called developmental and reproductive toxicology, or DART, studies. But drug companies often don’t begin these studies until they’ve already gotten clinical trials rolling.</p>



<p>This creates a catch-22, because clinical trials can’t include pregnant people until DART studies suggest it’s safe to do so. That’s why Lyerly and others pushing for change say that pharmaceutical companies should start doing these studies earlier, before clinical trials begin.</p>



<p>In 2018, <a href="https://www.fda.gov/media/112195/download">the FDA issued draft guidance</a> to help the pharmaceutical industry decide <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/blog/growth-curve/finally-plan-how-include-pregnant-women-clinical-trials">how and when to include pregnant people in clinical trials</a> (<em>SN Online: 5/30/18</em>). That guidance is an encouraging first step, Lyerly says, but it didn’t change any of the stringent rules for when pregnant people could be included in research.</p>



<p>Plus, it’s all completely voluntary, says Leyla Sahin, acting deputy director for safety in FDA’s Division of Pediatric and Maternal Health. “We advise industry…. We tell them we recommend that you include pregnant women in your clinical trials,” Sahin says. “But there’s no requirement.”</p>



<p>In fact, the FDA doesn’t even have the legal authority to create a requirement. In that sense, Sahin says, “we’re where pediatrics was 20 years ago.” Until Congress passed the Pediatric Research Equity Act of 2003, children were routinely excluded from clinical trials just as pregnant women are now. The pediatric law required drug companies to gather data on the safety and effectiveness of medications in children and to provide FDA an appropriate plan for pediatric studies.</p>



<p>Congress could pass a similar law for pregnancy. And in 2020, a government task force recommended exactly that to the Department of Health and Human Services, which oversees FDA. But “it’s almost like it’s gone into this black hole,” Sahin says. “We haven’t heard from HHS. We haven’t heard from Congress.”</p>

<h4>Stocking the medicine cabinet</h4>



<p>Until clinical trials during pregnancy become more routine, pregnant people face an untenable choice — take a drug without knowing its safety, or leave their medical conditions untreated.</p>



<p>Case in point: A group of 91 doctors and scientists published a <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/ s41574-021-00553-7">consensus statement</a> in September 2021 in <em>Nature Reviews Endocrinology</em> warning that acetaminophen, the most commonly used drug during pregnancy, may harm fetal development. Research suggests the drug disrupts hormones, with effects ranging from undescended testicles in male infants to an increased risk of ADHD and autism spectrum disorder in boys and girls.</p>



<p>But as is often the case with drugs and pregnancy, there’s not exactly a consensus among doctors about what pregnant people should do. In response to the new paper, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists issued a <a href="https://www.acog.org/news/news-articles/2021/09/response-to-consensus-statement-on-paracetamol-use-during-pregnancy">statement saying the evidence wasn’t strong enough</a> to suggest doctors should change their standard practice, which is to recommend acetaminophen be taken as needed and in moderation.</p>



<p>Acetaminophen is an active ingredient in more than 600 medications, including Tylenol, and is estimated to be used by up to 65 percent of pregnant people in the United States. It has long been the preferred pain medication and fever reducer during pregnancy because the <a href="https://www.fda.gov/drugs/drug-safety-and-availability/fda-recommends-avoiding-use-nsaids-pregnancy-20-weeks-or-later-because-they-can-result-low-amniotic">FDA recommends against the anti-inflammatory drugs known as NSAIDs</a> — such as ibuprofen and aspirin — in the second half of pregnancy. Those drugs have been linked to rare fetal kidney problems and low amniotic fluid levels.</p>



<p>While at the University of Copenhagen, clinical pharmacologist David Kristensen began studying acetaminophen’s effects on fetal development after noticing that the drug is structurally similar to chemicals that disrupt hormones. In 2011, he and colleagues published animal and human studies linking acetaminophen use during pregnancy <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21059752/">with concerning effects in infants</a>, including undescended testicles.</p>



<p>“My ears perked up when I heard that,” says Swan, the Mount Sinai reproductive epidemiologist and coauthor of the 2021 acetaminophen review. She had seen similar effects with maternal exposure to phthalates, chemicals used in plastics that are known to alter the activity of hormones needed to regulate fetal development.</p>



<p>She and colleagues surveyed 25 years of acetaminophen studies. The group found that five out of 11 relevant studies linked prenatal acetaminophen use to urogenital and reproductive tract abnormalities in children, and 26 out of 29 epidemiological studies linked fetal exposure to acetaminophen with neurodevelopmental and behavioral problems. The strength of these links varied, but were “generally modest,” the authors wrote.</p>



<p>“We’re looking at subtle effects here,” Swan says, “but that doesn’t mean that they’re not important.” With such widespread use, “there’s a good chance that a fair number of offspring are affected.”</p>



<p>Although Swan is wary of testing new drugs in pregnant women, she would like to see better research on medications during pregnancy. “There’s a whole range of options short of doing human study,” she says.</p>



<p>To start with, Swan says, scientists need better data on what medications pregnant women are taking, and how much. That means more studies should ask women to keep daily logs of every pill they take. Researchers can also do more studies of drugs’ reproductive effects in animals, she notes, and even transplant human tissues such as brain, liver or gonads into animals to learn how they respond to drugs.</p>



<h4>Not the same vulnerability</h4>



<p>The cultural shift around pregnancy research may be gaining momentum.</p>



<p>Government-funded research is one key area for change. In 2016, the 21st Century Cures Act established an interagency task force on research specific to pregnant and lactating women. It included officials from NIH, CDC and FDA, as well as medical societies and industry. <a href="https://www.nichd.nih.gov/about/advisory/PRGLAC/recommendations">One of the task force’s recommendations was acted upon in 2018</a>: removing pregnant women as a “vulnerable” group in a federal regulation called the Common Rule, which governs federally funded research. Pregnant women had been listed along with children, prisoners and people with intellectual disabilities as vulnerable and thus requiring special protections if included in research.</p>



<p>Unlike the other groups in that list, pregnant people “don’t have a diminished capacity to provide informed consent,” says Lyerly, the bioethicist at the University of North Carolina. That rule change alone could help “change the culture of research.”</p>



<p>Meanwhile, researchers are forging ahead with studies on many drugs used during pregnancy. <a href="https://mtnstopshiv.org/news/studies/mtn042">HIV drugs are among the most studied</a>, says Best of UC San Diego, in part because the virus can pass from pregnant women to their fetuses. “So right off the bat, everybody knew that we needed to treat these [pregnant] patients with medication,” she says. Yet data on HIV drugs during pregnancy lagged as much as 12 years after FDA approval.</p>



<div class="wp-block-sciencenews-content-sidebar">
<h3>Waiting game&nbsp;</h3>



<p>Even for HIV drugs, which are better studied during pregnancy than most drugs, it took an average of six years after U.S. Food and Drug Administration approval before the first data were published on a drug’s activity during pregnancy.</p>

<p>Many pregnant women appear to be willing to participate in research. More than 18,000 pregnant people had enrolled in the COVID-19 vaccine pregnancy registry as of March, and every year <a href="https://www.fda.gov/science-research/womens-health-research/list-pregnancy-exposure-registries">many volunteer for other pregnancy registries</a>.</p>



<p>Gyamfi-Bannerman says that in her experience, plenty of pregnant patients are willing to volunteer, even for experimental drugs, if there’s potential to benefit from the drug and they will be monitored closely. At Columbia University, she helped lead a clinical trials network called the Maternal Fetal Medicine Units Network that specifically studies complications during pregnancy. “It’s a very safe and protective environment,” she says.</p>



<p>As for next steps, a few policy changes could make a big difference, Best says, like “getting those preclinical studies done earlier and allowing people who accidentally get pregnant while participating in a clinical trial to make the choice of whether or not to stay.” Right now, “if you get pregnant, you’re out. Boom, that’s it,” she says. “But they were already exposed to the risk, and now they’re not getting the benefit. And so we don’t think that’s actually ethical.”</p>



<p>Thalidomide was prescribed to pregnant women to treat morning sickness, without ever having been tested in pregnant women. “We took the wrong lesson from thalidomide,” Lyerly says. “The first lesson of thalidomide is that we <em>should</em> do research, not that we shouldn’t.”</p>

                <p><em>By</em>&nbsp;<a href="https://emmayoung.net/">Emma Young</a></p>



<p>Plagiarism and cheating are persistent problems in higher education, note the authors of a <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0191886922000678">new paper</a> in <em>Personality and Individual Differences. </em>Better ways of combatting academic misconduct are clearly needed. And in their paper, Guy J. Curtis at the University of Western Australia and colleagues report that they’ve found one: encouraging students to take personal responsibility for their own learning.</p>



<span id="more-46033"></span>



<p>Recent work has consistently linked various forms of cheating to higher scores on the <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2022/02/15/understanding-bad-character-research-into-the-dark-triad-digested/">&#8220;Dark Triad&#8221; personality traits of psychopathy, Macchiavelianism and narcissism</a>, and also to stronger feelings of &#8220;academic entitlement&#8221;. Academically entitled students believe that they deserve special or better treatment than is typically given to others. As the researchers explain, this can involve a number of distinctly unappealing beliefs: that the student <em>deserves</em> above average grades, no matter what effort they put in; that instructors should be at their beck and call; and that when their assignments are marked, everyday problems should be regarded as reasons to up their grade. (Sound familiar? I can think of a number of academic friends who would immediately agree.)</p>



<p>Work to date has viewed the Dark Triad and academic entitlement as distinct factors that link independently to academic misconduct. But Curtis and his colleagues wondered if Dark Triad traits might in fact drive feelings of academic entitlement, which then drives misconduct. As they write: “Feelings of entitlement may stem from narcissistic perceptions that one should be treated as ‘special’, Machiavellian motivations to ‘get ahead’, or psychopathic disregard for the feelings of others.”</p>



<p>To explore this, they recruited 387 undergraduate students from three universities in Perth. The students completed scales that assessed Dark Triad traits, feelings of academic entitlement, and academic misconduct (they used a five-point scale to report on how regularly they &#8220;used notes during a closed-book exam&#8221;, for example).</p>



<p>As the team expected, they found positive correlations between scores on all three scales. But a deeper analysis of the data revealed that the link between higher scores on each of the Dark Triad traits and academic misconduct was driven by one of two aspects of academic entitlement: &#8220;externalised responsibilities&#8221;. A student who feels this way believes (implicitly or explicitly) that responsibility for learning lies less with them, and more with others. So, for example, if they miss a class, they might feel that it’s their tutor’s responsibility to get them the notes, not their own.</p>



<p>The other aspect of academic entitlement is &#8220;entitled expectations&#8221; — feeling that a professor must be entertaining to be good, or that they deserve lenient grading, for example. Why wasn’t this aspect, too, linked to misconduct? The researchers suggest that students with entitled expectations might think that any failure to meet them justified cheating, but if these expectations are actually being met, that justification isn’t there. In a student’s mind, though, externalised responsibilities might justify cheating no matter how their tutors behave: “If learning, per se, is not seen as the student’s responsibility, then taking shortcuts in assessment, such as cheating, may be considered acceptable,” the team writes.</p>



<p>One note of caution about the results: the students all self-reported their past cheating, plagiarism, and so on. As the team notes, it’s highly likely that they under-reported these behaviours. But that doesn’t change the main thrust of their findings. And they do suggest a potential route to reducing misconduct: if students who score relatively highly on psychopathy, Machiavellianism or narcissism (or all three) can be convinced to take responsibility for their own learning, the link between the Dark Triad and misconduct could be broken. “Our findings suggest that educators and institutions should communicate to students their personal responsibility for their academic success,” the team concludes.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/orange-dwarf-stars-radiation-goldilocks-habitable-planets">‘Goldilocks’ stars may pose challenges for any nearby habitable planets</a></h4>

              
                <p>If you’re an aspiring life-form, you might want to steer clear of planets around orange dwarf stars.</p>



<p>Some astronomers have called these orange suns <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/sun-may-not-be-goldilocks-star">“Goldilocks stars”</a> (<em>SN: 11/18/09</em>). They are dimmer and age more slowly than yellow sunlike stars, thus offering an orbiting planet a more stable climate. But they are brighter and age faster than red dwarfs, which often spew large flares. However, new observations show that <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.15237">orange dwarfs emit lots of ultraviolet light long after birth</a>, potentially endangering planetary atmospheres, researchers report in a paper submitted March 29 at arXiv.org.</p>



<p>Using data from the Hubble Space Telescope, astronomer Tyler Richey-Yowell and her colleagues examined 39 orange dwarfs. Most are moving together through the Milky Way in two separate groups, either 40 million or 650 million years old.</p>





<p>To Richey-Yowell’s surprise, she and her team found that the ultraviolet flux didn’t drop off from the younger orange stars to the older ones — unlike the case for yellow and red stars. “I was like, `What the heck is going on?’” says Richey-Yowell, of Arizona State University in Tempe.</p>



<p>In a stroke of luck, another team of researchers supplied part of the answer. As yellow sunlike stars age, they spin more slowly, causing them to be less active and emit less UV radiation. But for orange dwarfs, this steady spin-down stalls when the stars are roughly a billion years old, astronomer Jason Lee Curtis at Columbia University and colleagues reported in 2019.</p>



<p>“[Orange] stars are just much more active for a longer time than we thought they were,” Richey-Yowell says. That means these possibly not-so-Goldilocks stars probably maintain high levels of UV light for more than a billion years.</p>



<p>And that puts any potential life-forms inhabiting orbiting planets on notice. Far-ultraviolet light — whose photons, or particles of light, have much more energy than the UV photons that give you vitamin D — tears molecules in a planet’s atmosphere apart. That leaves behind individual atoms and electrically charged atoms and groups of atoms known as ions. Then the star’s wind — its outflow of particles — can carry the ions away, stripping the planet of its air.</p>



<p>But not all hope is lost for aspiring life-forms that have an orange dwarf sun. Prolonged exposure to far-ultraviolet light can stress planets but doesn’t necessarily doom them to be barren, says Ed Guinan, an astronomer at Villanova University in Pennsylvania who was not involved in the new work. “As long as the planet has a strong magnetic field, you’re more or less OK,” he says.</p>



<p>Though far-ultraviolet light splits water and other molecules in a planet’s atmosphere, the star’s wind can’t remove the resulting ions if a magnetic field as strong as Earth’s protects them. “That’s why the Earth survived” as a life-bearing world, Guinan says. In contrast, Venus might never have had a magnetic field, and Mars lost its magnetic field early on and most of its air soon after.</p>



<p>“If the planet doesn’t have a magnetic field or has a weak one,” Guinan says, “the game is over.”</p>



<p>What’s needed, Richey-Yowell says, is a study of older orange dwarfs to see exactly when their UV output declines. That will be a challenge, though. The easiest way to find stars of known age is to study a cluster of stars, but <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/hyades-star-cluster-closest-earth-death-throes">most star clusters get ripped apart</a> well before their billionth birthday (<em>SN: 7/24/20</em>). As a result, star clusters somewhat older than this age are rare, which means the nearest examples are distant and harder to observe.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/planet-decadal-survey-uranus-enceladus-astrobiology">U.S. planetary scientists want to explore Uranus and Enceladus next</a></h4>

              
                <p>The continuing search for life beyond Earth is driving many of the priorities for what’s next when it comes to U.S. planetary exploration. In a new report that could shape the next 10 years of planetary missions, Mars, Uranus and Saturn’s moon Enceladus have come out on top.</p>



<p>This report is the latest <a href="https://nap.nationalacademies.org/catalog/26522/origins-worlds-and-life-a-decadal-strategy-for-planetary-science">decadal survey for planetary science and astrobiology</a>. Every 10 years, experts convened by the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine compile a look at the state of the field and pull together a list of recommended priorities for the next decade of exploration. The new survey, which covers 2023 to 2032, will be used by NASA, the National Science Foundation and others to help guide which projects are pursued and funded.</p>



<p>The survey is meant in part &#8220;to identify the key scientific questions that are the most important&#8221; to pursue in the next decade and assess how best to answer them, astrophysicist Robin Canup said April 19 during a news conference after the report was released. Canup, of the Southwest Research Institute in Boulder, Colo., is a cochair of the steering committee for the decadal survey.</p>





<p>At the top of the list, the report recommends continuing the Mars sample-return effort by developing a mission that will retrieve, as soon as possible, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/nasa-perseverance-rover-mars-rock-sample-space">the rock and soil samples that NASA’s Perseverance rover is collecting</a> and storing (<em>SN: 9/10/21</em>). This multipart sample-return mission was also the top priority of the <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/best-next-space-missions">previous decadal survey</a>, released in 2011 (<em>SN: 3/7/11</em>). Those samples could hold hints of past signs of life on the Red Planet.</p>



<p>The report also suggests that the <em>next </em>Mars mission, after the sample-return one, should look for signs of life in the ice as well as gaseous biosignatures in the atmosphere. That one is farther down the priority list, though.</p>



<p>Next in the line after the Mars sample-return mission is a large, several-billion-dollar mission to send an orbiter and probe to Uranus to explore the planet, its ring system and its moons. Uranus and the solar system’s other ice giant, Neptune, were visited once, in the late 1980s, when Voyager 2 flew by each.</p>



<p>The <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/support-grows-return-ice-giants-uranus-and-neptune">time has come to go back</a>, scientists say (<em>SN: 2/10/16</em>). “I&#8217;m really thrilled to see that they picked a mission to go back and follow up on those incredible discoveries and those wonderful images that Voyager took,” says planetary scientist Linda Spilker of NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, Calif., who was not involved in the decadal survey. Spilker began her career with Voyager.</p>



<p>What’s more, better understanding the ice giants in our solar system could help scientists decipher the mysteries of faraway worlds. In the hunt for planets outside our solar system, the most common type of known exoplanets are those like Neptune and Uranus.</p>



<p>A mission to Uranus “will be transformative,” says planetary scientist Amy Simon of NASA Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Md., and a member of the decadal steering committee. “We&#8217;re sure there&#8217;s going to be fantastic discoveries.” &nbsp;</p>



<p>This mission could launch in June 2031 or April 2032, the report suggests. After swinging by Jupiter to use the giant planet’s gravity to fling it faster, the spacecraft would arrive at Uranus 13 years after its launch. Once there, the orbiter would drop a probe in the atmosphere, sampling its composition as never before.</p>



<p>The next highest priority is sending an “orbilander” to Saturn’s <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/whole-enceladus">moon Enceladus</a>, a world known to have easily accessible liquid water (<em>SN: 5/2/06</em>). NASA’s now-defunct Cassini mission discovered in 2005 that this small moon spews geysers of water into space, and more recent research suggests that water <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/saturn-moons-geysers-draw-water-subsurface-sea">coming from subsurface locales</a> has salts, possibly indicating warm pockets of water interacting with rock — and brewing an environment that may host life (<em>SN: 8/4/14</em>).</p>

<p>This proposed spacecraft would arrive at the moon in the early 2050s, where it would first spend 1.5 years orbiting Enceladus, flying through its watery plumes to sample the liquid. Then the spacecraft would land on the surface for a two-year mission.</p>



<p>“If you want to go and look for life, Enceladus is a very good place to do it,” says planetary scientist Francis Nimmo of the University of California, Santa Cruz, and a member of the decadal steering committee.</p>



<p>Life on other planets isn’t the only thing on planetary scientists’ minds. The report also recommends continuing work on a mission to find and characterize near-Earth objects, like asteroids and comets, in an effort to protect life on the only planet where it’s known to exist.</p>



<p>Two medium-sized missions should be funded in the next decade too, the report recommends. While the survey doesn’t specify targets for these missions, nine higher-priority locales are singled out, including Venus, Saturn’s moon Titan and Neptune’s moon Triton.</p>



<p>The decadal survey also considered the state of the fields of planetary science and astrobiology — namely decreasing funding opportunities and how to improve diversity, equity, inclusion and accessibility efforts. For the latter, the committee looked at whether the community has diverse representation through their members.</p>



<p>“The thing that became abundantly clear is that NASA has done a terrible job of collecting those kinds of statistics,” Nimmo says of demographics in planetary science. For now, the recommendation is to better survey the scientific community, he says. &nbsp;“We’re not going to be able to solve anything until we actually have better statistics.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2022/04/20/we-tend-to-prefer-political-candidates-with-higher-levels-of-education-heres-why/">We tend to prefer political candidates with higher levels of education — here’s why</a></h4>

              
                <p><em>By </em><a href="http://emilyoliviareynolds.com/">Emily Reynolds</a></p>



<p>What makes us vote for particular candidates often goes beyond their politics. Research has suggested that our voting preferences can be influenced by our own <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2019/04/08/people-who-view-their-britishness-or-englishness-as-causally-central-to-their-self-concept-more-likely-to-have-voted-for-brexit-study-finds/">self-identity</a>, candidates’ <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S004727270900142X">perceived beauty</a>, and even the <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1090513811001024">depth of their voices</a>. A new study looks at another factor that could sway our choices: education.</p>



<p>Writing in <em>Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin, </em><a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/01461672221077794">Jochem van Noord and team find</a> that people with low or high levels of education both prefer more educated politicians — but the reasons for this preference may be different for each group.</p>



<span id="more-46038"></span>



<p><a></a>In the first study, participants with varying levels of education were presented with four fictitious profiles of political candidates. Profiles indicated that candidates either had a masters degree or a high school diploma, and described activities that they had completed during university or school. Candidates were presented as either progressive or conservative.</p>



<p>After reviewing the profiles, participants rated the candidates’ competence, agency, warmth, and morality. They also indicated how likely they were to vote for them and to what extent they felt they identified personally with the candidate.</p>



<p>The results showed that, overall, participants not only viewed higher educated candidates as more competent, but were more likely to vote for them (in fact, the belief that more educated candidates were more competent could partly explain <em>why </em>participants were more likely to vote for them). They also rated these candidates higher on agency and morality.</p>



<p>Participants who themselves were more educated had a particularly strong belief in the higher educated candidates’ competence, and were more likely to vote for them, compared to less educated participants. This may reflect an in-group bias, as these participants also felt a stronger shared identity with higher than lower educated candidates. Lower educated participants identified more with candidates with more conservative political orientations.</p>



<p>If people prefer more educated candidates because they think they are more competent, what happens if a candidate with a lower level of education is portrayed as particularly competent? To find out, in a second study, the team presented some candidates as having extensive previous political experience and some as having none at all.</p>



<p>Again, higher educated candidates were seen as more competent and received higher voting intentions overall. But for less educated participants, candidate education was much less important than candidate <em>competence</em>: these participants didn’t show a preference for more educated candidates, but did prefer more competent candidates. This implies that in the first study, less educated participants didn’t prefer the higher educated candidates because of their educational background per se, but because this background conferred them with a sense of competency, the team argues.</p>



<p>For higher educated candidates, the important factor seemed to be identification. While they preferred competent to non-competent candidates, they also preferred higher over less educated candidates independent of levels of competency, indicating that they were more concerned with being part of an in-group than anything else. </p>



<p>If those of both higher and lower educational backgrounds prefer higher educated candidates, whatever the reason, this poses a question about how to democratise the political sphere. The most influential people in the country are already <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/elitism-in-britain-2019">much more likely</a> to have attended private school and elite universities, and the results from this study are not wholly encouraging when it comes to combatting this.</p>



<p>There may be some hope, however: less educated participants showed a preference for competence rather than education. For political candidates without elite higher education, thinking about ways to demonstrate competence may be key to success.</p>

<p><strong>Introduction and scope of work</strong></p>
<p>I am an ophthalmologist working in the fields of medical retina and uveitis. For the past few years, I have combined clinical and research works which are focused on prevention of vision loss as well as restoration and improvement of vision. Therefore, I see myself working to achieve the SDG 3 ‘Good Health and Well-being’. As it is well known, cataracts and diabetic retinopathy are the main cause of blindness worldwide, especially in countries where diabetes mellitus is prevalent, such as Saudi Arabia.</p>
<p><strong>The challenge with inherited retinal diseases</strong></p>
<p>Another visual problem common in the Saudi society are inherited retinal diseases, mainly due to the high consanguinity among Saudis. My research work has been largely focused on inherited retinal diseases and aiming to add to the scientific knowledge about these diseases. The ability to characterize, discover and fully describe the inherited retinal diseases helps in counseling related family members about the risks of having further affected members and the consequences of consanguinity.</p>
<p>Inherited retinal diseases impose significant economic on the healthcare system and the individual levels. On the healthcare system level, the consequences of inherited retinal diseases include the costs of primary, secondary and tertiary ophthalmic care, serial examinations and diagnostic tests. On the individual level, barriers to high quality education and challenges related to employment reflect clearly on the economic status of affected people. These considerations make my work related to SDG 1 which is to &#8220;end poverty in all its forms everywhere&#8221;.</p>
<p>Some of the challenges I have encountered during my research include poor knowledge about inherited retinal diseases among Saudi population, limited access to genetic testing, competitive funding, and the need for a well-designated registry or database for inherited retinal diseases. The limited funding for genetic testing and research work, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic outbreak, has affected considerably research work related to inherited retinal diseases.</p>

<p><strong>The future is promising </strong></p>
<p>Fortunately, I have been involved in a national retinal dystrophy registry at King Khaled Eye Specialist Hospital (KKESH) which is going to facilitate the research work in this field. Furthermore, Saudi Arabia was one of the first countries outside North America and Europe to provide the first food and drug association (FDA) approved treatment for patients with inherited retinal diseases caused by mutations in the <em>RPE65</em> gene which is Voretigene neparvovec-rzyl (Luxturna; Novartis). These successes would not have been made without the continuous support of the Saudi Government and ophthalmology leaders in the country.</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
<p>In conclusion, I am proud to have played a role in the recent advances which have been made in ophthalmic health care in Saudi Arabia, through my clinical and research works. More efforts are needed to raise the awareness of the Saudi population about preventable diseases such as diabetic retinopathy and inherited retinal diseases. Simple and cost effective measures include lifestyle modifications and reduction of the rates of consanguinity will greatly help achieving related SDG goals (SDG 1 and SDG 3).</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/europa-water-shallow-liquid-double-ridges-moon">Europa may have much more shallow liquid water than scientists thought</a></h4>

              
                <p>Europa’s frozen surface is covered with distinctive pairs of ridges that straddle troughs of ice. These double ridges are the most common features on the Jovian moon. But scientists don’t yet have a clear idea of how the oddities are created.</p>



<p>Now, an analysis of images of a similar set of ridges on Greenland’s ice sheet suggests that <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-022-29458-3">relatively shallow water</a> within Europa’s thick icy shell may be behind their formation, scientists report April 19 in <em>Nature Communications</em>. If so, that could mean that Europa has much more shallow liquid water than scientists have thought.</p>



<p>Europa’s double ridge systems, which can stretch for hundreds of kilometers, include some of the oldest features on the moon, says Riley Culberg, a geophysicist at Stanford University. Some researchers have proposed that the flexing of the moon’s icy shell due to <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/jupiter-moons-tidal-waves-ganymede-callisto-europa-io">tides in an underlying liquid water ocean</a> plays a role in the ridges’ formation (<em>SN: 8/6/20</em>). Yet others have suggested that water erupted from deep within the icy moon — a process known as cryovolcanism — to create the ridges. Without a closer look, though, it’s been hard to nail down a more solid explanation.</p>





<p>But Culberg and his colleagues seem to have caught a break. Data gathered by NASA’s ICESat-2 satellite in March 2016 showed an 800-meter-long double ridge system in northwestern Greenland. So the team looked back at other images to see when the ridge system first appeared and to assess how it grew. The researchers found that the ridges appeared in images taken as early as July 2013 and are still there today.</p>



<p>When the ridges — which lie on either side of a trough, like those on Europa — reached full size, they averaged only 2.1 meters high. That’s a lot smaller than the ridges on Europa, which can rise 300 meters or more from the moon’s surface. But surface gravity is much lower on Europa, so ridges can grow much larger there, Culberg says. When he and his colleagues considered the difference between Earth’s gravity and Europa’s in their calculations, they found that the proportions of the two ridge systems are consistent.</p>

<p>Scientists will never get a perfect analog of Europa on Earth, but the ridges in Greenland “look just like the Europan ridges,” says Laurent Montési, a geophysicist at the University of Maryland in College Park who was not involved in the study.</p>



<p>Data from airplane-mounted radar gathered in March 2016 show that a water-filled layer of snow about 10 to 15 meters below the surface underlies the Greenland ridges, Culberg and his team say. That water comes from surface meltwater that sinks into and is then collected in the buried snow, which in turn sits atop an impermeable layer of ice.</p>



<p>Repeated freeze-thaw cycles of water in that layer of snow would squeeze water toward the surface, the researchers propose. In the first phase of refreezing, a solid plug of ice forms. Then, as more water freezes, it expands and is forced toward the surface on either side of that plug, pushing material upward and producing the double ridges at the surface.</p>



<p>On Europa, the process works the same way, the researchers suggest. But because there is no known meltwater or precipitation at the moon’s surface, near-surface water there probably would have to come from <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/another-hint-europa-watery-plumes-found-20-year-old-galileo-data">the ocean thought to be trapped beneath the moon’s icy shell</a> (<em>5/14/18</em>). Once that water rose toward the surface through cracks, it could pool in thick layers of ice shattered by tidal flexing or the impacts of meteorites.</p>



<p>“There’s a general consensus that these ridges grow from cracks in the ice,” says William McKinnon, a planetary scientist at Washington University in Saint Louis who was not involved in the study. “But <em>how</em> do they do it is the question.”</p>



<p>The answer to that question may not be long in coming, McKinnon says. NASA’s Europa Clipper mission is scheduled to launch in late 2024. If all goes well, the orbiter will arrive at Jupiter in April 2030. “If there’s anything like what has happened in Greenland going on at Europa, we’ll be able to see it,” he says.</p>



<p>Researchers will also be interested to see if the mission can ascertain what sort of materials might have been brought to Europa’s surface from the ocean deep below, because the moon is considered to be one of the best places in the solar system <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/alien-oceans-book-search-extraterrestrial-life-outer-solar-system">to look for extraterrestrial life</a> (<em>SN: 4/8/20</em>).</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/jack-in-the-pulpit-plant-flower-sex-lure-pollinator-death">These flowers lure pollinators to their deaths. There’s a new twist on how</a></h4>

              
                <p>Fake — and fatal — invitations to romance could be the newest bit of trickery uncovered among some jack-in-the-pulpit wildflowers.</p>



<p>The fatal part isn’t the surprise. Jack-in-the-pulpits (<em>Arisaema</em>) are the only plants known to kill their own insect pollinators as a matter of routine, says evolutionary ecologist Kenji Suetsugu of Kobe University in Japan. The new twist, if confirmed, would be <a href="https://nph.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/ppp3.10261">using sexual deception</a> to woo pollinators into the death traps.</p>



<p>Until now, biologists have found only three plant families with any species that pretend to offer sex to insects, Suetsugu says online March 28 in <em>Plants, People, Planet.</em> But unlike deceit in jack-in-the-pulpits, those other attractions aren’t fatal, just phony.</p>



<p>The <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/promiscuous-orchids">orchid family has turned out multiple cheats</a>, some <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/better-local-lady">so seductive</a> that a male insect leaves wasted sperm as well as pollen on a flower. Yet he doesn’t get even a sip of nectar (<em>SN: 3/5/08; SN: 3/27/08</em>). Similar scams have turned up among daisies: A few dark bumps that a human in bad light might mistake for an insect can <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/sexually-deceived-flies-not-hopelessly-dumb">drive male flies to frenzies</a> on the yellow, orange or red <em>Gorteria</em> petals. Enthusiasm wanes with repeated disappointment though (<em>SN: 1/29/14</em>). And among irises, a species dangles velvety purple petals where deluded insects wallow.</p>

<p>Two jack-in-the-pulpit species in Japan have now raised suspicions that their family, the arums, should be added to the list of sexual cheats. To visually oriented humans, the 180 or so <em>Arisaema</em> species look like just a merry reminder of evolution’s endless weirdness. Some kind of flappy canopy, sometimes striped, bends over a little cupped “pulpit” with a pinkie-tip stub or mushroom bulge of plant flesh peeping over the rim. Below the rim, swaths of flowers open in succession — male blooms overtaken by flowers with female parts — as the plant grows from slim young jack to big mama.</p>



<p>These oddball flowers depend mostly on pollinators that deserve a much bigger fan base: fungus gnats. These gnats, small as punctuation marks and hard to identify, are true flies. But don’t hold that against them. They don’t stalk picnic spreads or buzz-thump against windows. Pollinating gnats “are very frail,” Suetsugu says, and their wings make no noise a human can hear.</p>





<p>Nor can a human always smell what draws fungus gnats. It’s clear, though, that the varied canopied pulpits can have a strong happy hour lure for those cruising pollinators looking to meet the right gnat. This will go terribly wrong.</p>



<p>A tiny escape hatch deep in the trap stays open during the male phase of flowering, but that two-millimeter hole vanishes during the big mama stage. A gnat can’t overcome the slippery, flaking wax of the plant’s inner wall to climb out. &nbsp;So any gnat tricked twice is doomed.</p>



<p>Biologists had assumed that jack-in-the-pulpits seeking fungus gnats were perfuming the air with mushroomy, nice-place-to-have-kids scents. Many kinds seem to do so, but homey smells don’t explain an odd observation by Suetsugu and his colleagues. Of the important pollinator species for two Japanese jack-in-the-pulpits (<em>A. angustatum</em> and <em>A. peninsulae), </em>almost all the specks found in the traps were males.</p>





<p>An odor lure targeting males might mimic a come-hither scent of female gnats, the researchers propose. That’s outright fraud. Even if the hopeful males find a mate in the waxy green dungeon, they and their offspring would starve. They’re stuck in a plant with no fungus to eat. Whatever that ruinous scent is, a human nose can barely detect it, Suetsugu reports.</p>



<p>The notion that biologists have so far overlooked a scent important to other animals seems “more than possible” to Kelsey J.R.P. Byers of the John Innes Centre in Norwich, England. Byers&#8217; work overturned a common assumption that monkeyflowers (<em>Mimulus</em>) had no scent even though hawkmoths, flying at night and known to track odors, visit the flowers.</p>



<p>“We’re such visual creatures,” says Byers, who studies floral scents. We can laugh at how insects mistake some off-color blob of plant tissue for a fabulous female, but we’re missing the odors. Fungus gnats, however, even look like the citizens of a smellier world, with giant guy-style antennae “like an ostrich plume on a hat.”</p>



<p>At least now, modern analytical lab techniques and equipment are opening up the vast sensory world of communication wafting around us. To see if even familiar plants like jack-in-the-pulpits are up to something odd, scientists need to identify the lure itself. Then maybe we’ll understand the irresistible valentine scent of a female fungus gnat.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/ingenuity-helicopter-mars-nasa-flight-1-year-anniversary">Here’s how NASA’s Ingenuity helicopter has spent 1 year on Mars</a></h4>

              
                <p>One year ago, Ingenuity took its first flight on Mars. And its story since is that of a real-world little helicopter that could.</p>



<p>Ingenuity traveled to the Red Planet attached to the belly of NASA’s Perseverance rover, and <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/mars-how-watch-nasa-perseverance-lander-touch-down">both arrived in Jezero crater</a> last February (<em>SN: 2/17/21</em>). About six weeks later, the helicopter began what was meant to be only a 30-day technology demonstration to see if flight is possible in the thin Martian atmosphere.</p>



<p>It <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/nasa-ingenuity-helicopter-first-flight-mars-perseverance-rover">proved it could fly</a> — and then some (<em>SN: 4/19/21</em>). Over the next couple weeks, Ingenuity took four more flights, each time going a bit farther, a bit faster and a bit higher. After those first test flights, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/nasa-ingenuity-helicopter-mission-extended-mars-perseverance">Ingenuity’s mission morphed</a> from a technology demonstration to operations, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/ingenuity-helicopter-flying-mars-perseverance-nasa">helping Perseverance traverse the surface</a> by scouting the terrain ahead (<em>SN: 4/30/21</em>; <em>SN: 12/10/21</em>).</p>





<p>Before the helicopter arrived, scientists had two perspectives of Mars. “We have pictures taken from orbit around Mars, and then we have pictures taken by rovers driving on the ground,” says planetary scientist Kirsten Siebach of Rice University in Houston, who is not part of the Ingenuity team. “But now this has opened up an entirely new perspective on Mars.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Ingenuity has surpassed all expectations. It has shown not only that flight is possible but also what is possible with flight. <em>Science News</em> discussed the helicopter’s big moments, collaboration with the rover and upcoming flights with Håvard Fjær Grip. He’s Ingenuity’s chief pilot and an engineer at NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, Calif. His answers were edited for length and clarity.</p>



<p><strong><em>SN</em></strong><strong>: What does the “chief pilot” for a helicopter on another planet do?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Grip:</strong> The biggest part of the job is planning the flights. Ingenuity doesn’t know where it is or where it wants to go when it wakes up, so all of those decisions are made here [on Earth]. Every maneuver that the helicopter makes during the flight is planned here on the ground first, and then we uplink the instructions to Ingenuity. When it comes time to fly, it uses its onboard software to follow our instructions as precisely as possible.</p>

<p><strong><em>SN</em></strong><strong>: Ingenuity has </strong><a href="https://mars.nasa.gov/technology/helicopter/#Flight-Log"><strong>completed 25 flights</strong></a><strong>. Can you talk about how it’s exceeded expectations?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Grip:</strong> It is pretty great. We came there expecting to perform at most five flights within the 30-day window. And all of that was going to happen within in a small area that we carefully selected. We spent weeks figuring out exactly where to place the helicopter, studying these tiny little rocks. Everything was mapped out. And then things went so well when we started flying that almost immediately people started thinking, &#8220;Wow, let’s try to make use of this beyond those five flights.&#8221;</p>



<p>We started this next phase where, to be useful at all, we had to fly away from this carefully selected area. I’m really proud of that. We’ve been able to take this technology that was designed for this very limited mission and extend it to go and land different places on Mars and to travel across terrain that, originally, we had never planned on traveling across.</p>



<p>It’s lasted now for over a year since we deployed it to the surface. I don’t think any of us had imagined that that would be possible.</p>



<p><strong><em>SN</em></strong><strong>: Have there been any specific flights that have stood out to you?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Grip:</strong> Obviously, the first flight. That was the most important flight; it still is. We had a more challenging [time on] flight six. It became exciting, because we had an anomaly during the flight.  [A glitch led to navigation images being marked with the wrong time stamps, which caused Ingenuity to sway back and forth during its flight.] Ingenuity had to power through that and survive and get down on the ground in one piece. </p>



<p>We’ve had some flights that have been dedicated to scouting activities. We went to an area where the rover was going to spend several months, and we went ahead of the rover and scouted [it] out so the rover drivers could be more efficient in finding safe ways to drive. Those were flights 12 and 13. Then some of these longer flights have been exciting. Flight No. 9, until a few days ago, was the biggest thing we’d ever done, at [a distance of] 625 meters. And with flight 25, we just beat that and flew more than 700 meters.</p>



<p><strong><em>SN</em></strong><strong>: There was a flight recently that had to be postponed because of a dust storm, right?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Grip:</strong> That’s correct. That was flight No. 19. With flying, whether it’s on Mars or here on Earth, you’re worried about weather. We always look at the weather before flying. And every time we’ve done that [on Mars], it had been more or less the same. Then the afternoon before we were about to open flight 19, we were notified that we had a dust storm. That delayed us by quite a bit. When we woke up from that, we had dust on our navigation camera lens, and sand covered our legs partially. We had to fly out of that, and it was a new challenge for the helicopter, but again, it tackled that perfectly.</p>

<p><strong><em>SN</em></strong><strong>: Ingenuity has flown through two seasons on Mars. As seasons change, so does air pressure. Does that affect the helicopter?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Grip:</strong> Yeah, that’s a pretty big deal. We knew, for several years before launch, exactly when we were going to land and where we were going to land. Our design was geared towards the first few months after landing, and that coincided with a particular season [spring] in Jezero crater on Mars. We could [ahead of launch] predict reasonably well what the air density would be. And when we extended [the mission] beyond that, the air density started dropping. To be able to keep flying, we had to increase our rotor speed. In fact, we increased it above anything we tested on Earth. Now we’ve come out of summer, the density has started climbing again, and we’ve been able to go back to our original rotor speed and also extend our flight time.</p>



<p><strong><em>SN</em></strong><strong>: What comes next? Are there any big flights planned soon?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Grip:</strong> We’re going to make our way over to the <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/feature/jpl/nasa-s-perseverance-rover-hightails-it-to-martian-delta">river delta that Perseverance is headed toward</a>. We’ve just completed the biggest obstacle to doing that, flight 25, which was getting across this region called Séítah, which has a lot of sand and varied terrain. And when we get to the river delta, there are a few different options on the table: to help the rover drivers, to scout out targets, or even potentially to do some scouting on behalf of the next Mars mission. Perseverance is the first part of a sample return campaign. It’s sampling right now. And those samples will be left on the surface and will be eventually picked up — that’s the plan anyway — and sent back to Earth.</p>



<p><strong>SN: What does Ingenuity mean for future exploration?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Grip:</strong> This is a new era. Aviation in space is now a thing. We can’t think about Mars exploration without aerial assets as part of that. I think that’s the most exciting thing.</p>

The EQUATOR Network aims to improve the quality and transparency of health research, primarily by promoting awareness of reporting guidelines and providing education and training in good reporting practices.</p>
<p>Reporting guidelines such as <a href="https://www.equator-network.org/reporting-guidelines/consort/">CONSORT</a>, <a href="https://www.equator-network.org/reporting-guidelines/strobe/">STROBE</a>, and <a href="https://www.equator-network.org/reporting-guidelines/prisma/">PRISMA</a> exist for all of the main study designs in health research, and there are hundreds of extensions and adaptations that cover different types of study and areas of medicine. The <a href="https://www.equator-network.org/library/">EQUATOR Library</a> provides a one-stop shop for reporting-related resources, including a <a href="https://www.equator-network.org/reporting-guidelines/">searchable database of reporting guidelines</a>.</p>
<p>In 2018, the UK EQUATOR Centre developed and launched the <a href="https://www.goodreports.org/">GoodReports website</a> to help authors find and use reporting guidelines when writing up research for publication. These guidelines ensure a clear and complete account of an author’s study, including the information needed for readers to understand exactly what was done, how, why, and the implications of the findings.</p>
<p>The development of the GoodReports website was inspired by the series <a href="https://www.thelancet.com/series/research">Research: increasing value, reducing waste</a> published in <em>The Lancet </em>in 2014. The final paper of the series, <a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(13)62228-X/fulltext">Reducing waste from incomplete or unusable reports of biomedical research</a>, concluded that funding should be invested into the development and maintenance of infrastructure to support better reporting, more research on reporting, and wider implementation of its findings. The initial development and piloting work on GoodReports won the prestigious <a href="https://www.ndorms.ox.ac.uk/news/equator-network-awarded-for-reducing-waste-in-research">Cochrane-REWARD prize</a> for its potential to reduce research waste.</p>
<p>The GoodReports website includes a reporting guideline finder – the “EQUATOR wizard” – which helps researchers identify the most appropriate reporting guideline for their paper. It delivers an online and downloadable checklist containing links to further explanation of individual points and provides examples of good reporting. These tools directly help authors in writing their paper as accurately and completely as possible. Authors are also encouraged to submit the checklist alongside their manuscript to their chosen journal, demonstrating explicitly that an appropriate reporting guideline has been followed.</p>
<p>In October 2021 we published an <a href="https://bmcmedresmethodol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12874-021-01402-x">article in <em>BMC Medical Research Methodology</em></a> describing the user experience and behaviour of authors using the GoodReports website both inside and outside the journal manuscript submission process.</p>
<p>Data from this study suggested that reporting guidance would be more useful if delivered to authors earlier in the writing process.  Data also suggested that guidance is less actionable when delivered in the most common “checklist” format. With this in mind we developed GoodReports further by using the checklist database to generate editable article templates, designed to make following and implementing guidance easier for the author.</p>
<p>As we move forward with additional research on the topic, we have started a study funded by the UK Medical Research Council, which is now recruiting authors to <a href="https://www.goodreports.org/grreat/">GRReaT</a>, a randomized controlled trial to test whether authors given a GoodReports article template write more complete research articles. We are comparing a group given an article template containing items from the appropriate reporting guideline for their study with a control group simply given a reporting guideline recommendation and general reporting guidance.</p>
<p>We are looking for participants who are writing up the following types of health-related study</p>
<ul>
<li>Cohort study</li>
<li>Case-control study</li>
<li>Cross-sectional study</li>
<li>Observational study in nutrition or dietetics</li>
<li>Systematic review (of a healthcare intervention)</li>
<li>Randomized trial of a pharmaceutical, medical device, procedure, or social or psychological intervention</li>
</ul>
<p>As a thank you for participating in the trial, all trial participants receive a &#8220;completeness&#8221; report on their draft manuscript from reporting experts at the UK EQUATOR Centre. The report focuses on the methods and results sections of the manuscript and indicates to authors whether individual essential reporting items from the relevant reporting guideline have been reported adequately or need further clarification or additional information.  The report also includes general writing tips to improve clarity and readability. This report can be used to improve their manuscript before they submit it, which could mean a smoother journey through peer review and the wider editorial process.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/nuclear-imaging-prototype-tumors-glow-cerenkov-light">A new nuclear imaging prototype detects tumors’ faint glow</a></h4>

              
                <p>A type of light commonly observed in astrophysics experiments and nuclear reactors can help detect cancer. In a clinical trial, a prototype of an imaging machine that relies on this usually bluish light, called Cerenkov radiation, successfully <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41551-022-00876-4#citeas">captured the presence and location</a> of cancer patients’ tumors, researchers report April 11 in <em>Nature Biomedical Engineering</em>.</p>



<p>When compared with standard scans of the tumors, the Cerenkov light images were classified as “acceptable” or higher for 90 percent of patients, says Magdalena Skubal, a cancer researcher at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center in New York City.</p>



<p><a>Cerenkov radiation is generated by high-speed particles </a><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/particle-detector-matter-subatomic-images-physics">traveling faster than light</a> through a material, such as bodily tissue (<em>SN: 8/5/21</em>). Nothing can travel faster than the speed of light in a vacuum, but light travels more slowly through a material, allowing particles to overtake it. In Cerenkov luminescence imaging, or CLI, particles released by radiotracers cause the target tissue to vibrate and relax in a way that emits light, which is then captured by a camera.</p>





<p>Between May 2018 and March 2020, in the largest clinical trial of its kind to date, 96 participants underwent both CLI and standard imaging, such as positron emission tomography/computed tomography, or PET/CT. Participants with a variety of diagnoses, including lymphoma, thyroid cancer and metastatic prostate cancer, received one of five radiotracers and were then imaged by the prototype — a camera in a light-proof enclosure.</p>

<p>Skubal and colleagues found that CLI detected all radiotracers, suggesting that the technology is more versatile than PET/CT scans, which work with only some radiotracers.</p>



<p>CLI images aren’t as precise as those from PET/CT scans. But CLI could be used as an initial diagnostic test or to assess the general size of a tumor undergoing treatment, says study coauthor Edwin Pratt, also of Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center. “It would be a quick and easy way to see if there&#8217;s something off … [that warrants] further investigation,” Pratt says.<br><br>The findings strengthen the case for the technology as a promising low-cost alternative that could expand access to nuclear imaging in hospitals, says Antonello Spinelli, a preclinical imaging scientist at Experimental Imaging Centre in Milan, Italy, who was not involved in the research.<a href="https://sites.google.com/site/snstaffresources/resources/citation-styles"></a></p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/fast-radio-burst-planet-neutron-star-cosmic">Crumbling planets might trigger repeating fast radio bursts</a></h4>

              
                <p>Fragmenting planets sweeping extremely close to their stars might be the cause of mysterious cosmic blasts of radio waves.</p>



<p>Milliseconds-long fast radio bursts, or FRBs, erupt from distant cosmic locales. Some of these bursts blast only once and others repeat. A new computer calculation suggests the repetitive kind <a href="https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ac558f">could be due to a planet interacting with its magnetic host star</a>, researchers report in the March 20 <em>Astrophysical Journal</em>.</p>



<p>FRBs are relative newcomers to astronomical research. Ever since the first was discovered in 2007, researchers <a href="https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4365/ac33ab">have added hundreds</a> to the tally. Scientists have theorized dozens of ways the two different types of FRBs can occur, and nearly all theories include compact, magnetic stellar remnants known as neutron stars. Some ideas include powerful radio flares from magnetars, the <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/milky-way-flash-implicates-magnetars-source-fast-radio-bursts">most magnetic neutron stars imaginable</a> (<em>SN: 6/4/20</em>). Others suggest a <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/fast-radio-burst-source-star-cluster-old-globular">fast-spinning neutron star</a>, or even asteroids interacting with magnetars (<em>SN: 2/23/</em>22).</p>





<p>“How fast radio bursts are produced is still up for debate,” says astronomer Yong-Feng Huang of Nanjing University in China.</p>



<p>Huang and his colleagues considered a new way to make the repeating flares: interactions between a <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/new-evidence-planets-orbiting-pulsar">neutron star and an orbiting planet</a> (<em>SN: 3/5/94</em>). Such planets can get exceedingly close to these stars, so the team calculated what might happen to a planet in a highly elliptical orbit around a neutron star. When the planet swings very close to its star, the star’s gravity pulls more on the planet than when the planet is at its farthest orbital point, elongating and distorting it. This “tidal pull,” Huang says, will rip some small clumps off the planet. Each clump in the team’s calculation is just a few kilometers wide and maybe one-millionth the mass of the planet, he adds.</p>



<p>Then the fireworks start. Neutron stars spew a wind of radiation and particles, much like our own sun but more extreme. When one of these clumps passes through that stellar wind, the interaction “can produce really strong radio emissions,” Huang says. If that happens when the clump appears to pass in front of the star from Earth’s perspective, we might see it as a fast radio burst. Each burst in a repeating FRB signal could be caused by one of these clumps interacting with the neutron star’s wind during each close planet pass, he says. After that interaction, what remains of the clump drifts in orbit around the star, but away from Earth’s perspective, so we never see it again.</p>



<p>Comparing the calculated bursts to two known repeaters — <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/repeating-fast-radio-bursts-recorded-first-time">the first ever discovered</a>, which repeats roughly every 160 days, and a more recent discovery that repeats every 16 days, the team found the fragmenting planet scenario could explain how often the bursts happened and how bright they were (<em>SN: 3/2/16</em>).</p>



<p>The star’s strong gravitational “tidal” pull on the planet during each close pass might change the planet’s orbit over time, says astrophysicist Wenbin Lu of Princeton University, who was not involved in this study but who investigates possible FRB scenarios. “Every orbit, there is some energy loss from the system,” he says. “Due to tidal interactions between the planet and the star, the orbit very quickly shrinks.” So it’s possible that the orbit could shrink so fast that FRB signals wouldn’t last long enough for a chance detection, he says.</p>



<p>But the orbit change could also give astronomers a way to check this scenario as an FRB source. Observing repeating FRBs over several years to track any changes in the time between bursts could narrow down whether this hypothesis could explain the observations, Lu says. “That may be a good clue.”</p>

<h4>Turning tides</h4>



<p><em>Gravitational interactions with nearby planets and stars can hurl giant exoplanets into orbits that bring them close to their suns, <strong>Ken Croswell</strong> reported in “<a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/hot-jupiter-orbit-sun-close-gravity-star-planet">Hot Jupiters may be kicked into place</a>” (</em>SN: 3/12/22, p. 13<em>).</em></p>



<p><strong>Croswell</strong> wrote that a hot Jupiter gets put on a highly elliptical and inclined orbit that brings the planet close to its star. Over time, the star’s gravity makes the planet’s orbit smaller and rounder. Some readers wondered if atmospheric friction, not gravity, plays the main role in the orbit’s transformation.</p>





<p>“Friction isn’t what causes a close-in planet’s orbit to change,” <strong>Croswell</strong> says. Instead, gravity between the star and planet raises strong tides — similar to those formed from the gravitational interactions between Earth and its moon. It is those tides that rob the world of orbital energy, gradually shrinking and rounding the orbit, he says. “This process goes by various names, such as ‘tidal circularization’ and ‘tidal damping.’ ”</p>



<h4>It’s shear science</h4>



<p><em>Computer simulations suggest that weird “superionic” matter, which behaves like a mash-up of solid and liquid, could explain the oddities of Earth’s center, <strong>Emily Conover</strong> reported in “<a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/earth-inner-core-superionic-matter-weird-solid-liquid">Earth’s inner core may be ‘superionic’ </a>” (</em>SN: 3/12/22, p. 12<em>).</em></p>



<p>One simulation showed that a superionic inner core slows shear waves, seismic waves that jiggle the Earth perpendicular to their direction of travel, <strong>Conover </strong>wrote. The phenomenon may explain the unexpectedly low shear wave velocities previously measured in the inner core. Reader<strong> Jeff Fisher </strong>asked how shear waves could occur in the inner core when such waves aren’t able to pass through liquids like Earth’s outer core.</p>



<p>It’s true that shear waves, also known as secondary or S waves, cannot travel through the liquid outer core, <strong>Conover </strong>says. But primary waves, or P waves, which compress and expand the Earth in a direction parallel to their travel, <em>can</em>. “When a P wave goes through the outer core and meets the inner core, it can create an S wave that will travel through the inner core,” <strong>Conover </strong>says. “When that S wave meets the outer core again, it will create a P wave that will travel through the outer core and onward. Scientists can measure that P wave and draw conclusions about the S wave that traveled through the inner core.”</p>

<h3>Dino in the dumps</h3>



<p>Fossilized lesions in the vertebrae of a 150-million-year-old juvenile sauropod (illustrated) may record the oldest known respiratory infection in a dinosaur, <strong>Sid Perkins</strong> reported in “<a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/dinosaur-lung-infection-fossils-oldest-case">Fossils reveal a case of the dino sniffles</a>” (<em>SN: 3/12/22, p. 10</em>).

<h4>A century of climate</h4>



<p><em>The last century and a half of climate science has strengthened our understanding of the roots and impacts of human-caused climate change, <strong>Alexandra Witze</strong> reported in “<a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/climate-change-crisis-history-research-carbon-human-impact">A planetary crisis</a>” (</em>SN: 3/12/22, p. 16<em>).</em></p>



<p>Reader <strong>Connie Hellyer </strong>lauded <strong>Witze’s </strong>coverage as “masterful in its scope and clarity.” The article “should be required reading for policy makers, voters and all confused by the shards of sometimes conflicting and out-of-context factoids coming from every direction.”</p>



<h4>Update</h4>



<p>“<a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/animal-human-organ-transplants-pig-kidney-heart-history">A high-profile transplant milestone</a>” described the first transplant of a genetically modified pig heart into a human (<em>SN: 3/12/22, p. 26</em>). David Bennett, the 57-year-old man who received the organ, died on March 8, two months after the surgery.</p>



<h4>Correction</h4>



<p>In “<a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/james-webb-space-telescope-l2-lagrange-point">James Webb telescope gets in position</a>” (<em>SN: 2/26/22, p. 10</em>), the definition of L2 wasn’t quite right. L2, the telescope’s home, is a relatively stable region where the sun’s and Earth’s gravity combine to provide the centripetal force needed to keep a smaller object on a curved path.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/to-solve-mysteries-scientists-look-to-muons">To solve mysteries, scientists look to muons</a></h4>

              
                <p>I don’t usually sit at my desk thinking, “Hmm, a muon just flew through my thumbnail.” But now I know that these subatomic particles from the upper atmosphere do just that.</p>



<p>And thanks to this issue’s cover story, I also know that muons are so good at tunneling through objects that scientists are using them to make discoveries on Earth.</p>



<p>Muons aren’t a big deal in everyday life. These “awkward cousins of electrons,” as physics senior writer Emily Conover describes them, don’t play a key role in making atoms. But by tracking muons as they barge ahead, researchers can detect what’s inside otherwise impenetrable objects. The process, known as muography, is a bit like taking an X-ray or a CT scan, but with naturally occurring subatomic particles. Conover explains how tracking muons’ paths has revealed a secret chamber in the Great Pyramid of Giza and the plumbing of some volcanoes. Researchers hope these new pictures of volcanoes will help them more accurately predict eruptions.</p>





<p>As journalists, we tend to pay more attention to big scientific discoveries, so I was curious as to how Conover decided that it was time <em>Science News</em> paid attention to these arcane particles. Like all our reporters, she spends a lot of time digging through research journals to learn what’s new and sniff out trends. “If you see one paper in a journal you say, ‘Huh, there’s something cool happening in muography.’ Then you see another one and think, maybe this is the right time to write about it.”</p>



<p>Physicists are increasingly interested in studying muons, but what really grabbed Conover’s attention is <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/?p=3113085">how researchers are using muons as tools in other fields of science</a>, including geology and archaeology. Muons are even being tested to see if they can help customs officials detect smuggled goods. “It’s so fun and interesting to learn about,” Conover says.</p>



<p>She is no stranger to subatomic particles, having studied neutrinos for her Ph.D. in particle physics. “For a lot of physics experiments, muons are kind of a pesky nuisance,” Conover says. “If you’re looking for something that’s rare or difficult to spot, muons can get in the way.” Her research involved building a muon detector to filter out the pesky particles. And many physics experiments are built deep underground, where the ground above muffles muons.</p>



<p>Rather than shunning muons as annoying uninvited guests, scientists are beginning to appreciate their humble virtues. Conover is one of them. “I’m personally familiar with muons being a nuisance, but it didn’t make me dislike them,” she says. “It made me respect them. They’re everywhere. And you can learn something from all the different particles, whatever they may be.”</p>



<p>This issue also marks a major scientific milestone: <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/human-genome-complete-dna-genetics">the first complete scan of a human genome</a>. You may be wondering, wasn’t this announced back in 2003, when the Human Genome Project wrapped up? Yes, kinda. That epic project had to skip some key bits of DNA due to technological limitations. Better technology now means 3,604 more genes to explore, some of which play key roles in assembling the human brain and may help reveal how we evolved differently than other apes.</p>
