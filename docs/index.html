                A neuroscientist once called the “prince of panspermia” has lost a lawsuit against Springer Nature stemming from a 2019 paper of his that a journal retracted. Here’s the summary from United States District Judge John P. Cronan, who heard the original case: Rhawn Joseph, Ph.D., proceeding pro se, is a scientist who claims he found &#8230; <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2021/12/21/court-tosses-50-billion-suit-by-prince-of-panspermia-against-springer-nature/" class="more-link">Continue reading <span class="screen-reader-text">Court tosses $50 billion suit by ‘prince of panspermia’ against Springer Nature</span></a>

                <h3>What am I really doing?</h3>
<p>RPM packaging with Fedora. RPM files are like zip files (compressed) composed of different softwares mixed to work together.</p>
<p>Let's just say an RPM packager does the packaging so users can simply use a command line to install softwares e.g </p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code>$ sudo dnf install fedora-packager
</code></pre></div>

<p>Before Outreachy I did not have the slightest idea of what packaging was all about as a matter of fact it was completely new to me.</p>
<h3>How it all started</h3>
<p>Scrolling through lists of outreachy projects, I came accross the NeuroFedora project and I picked interest in it because it did not require much (lol) ... I joined the Fedora community and jeez I was lost, everything was so new I just wanted to give up, but I saw other applicants curious and asking questions. So I decided to give it a try. </p>
<p>I read the docs sent by our mentor (Ankur Sinha) https://fedoramagazine.org/rpm-packages-explained/</p>
<p>Well... I was getting a hang of it but not so much and gosh I was intimidated by how much my collegues were picking up already. I decided to write my mentor (private) and he replied! He led me to the open chat where I mustered up courage to ask questions about my uncertainties and within few weeks I was already packaging for Fedora. </p>
<p>The most interesting part is till now I "always" get stuck on projects and still seek help from my mentor and community members.  I've learnt through the journey that no one really knows it all but you can strive for mastery by consistency, openess, and willingness. </p>

                <img width="140" height="110" src="https://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2021/12/1_efxp_yDIauT01oILEJjrVw-140x110.png" class="attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image" alt="" style="display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear:both;" /><p>When patients start dialysis, the overall goal is for these treatments to become part of their lives and try to maintain as much of their daily routine including family commitments and employment. Unfortunately, this situation is not the norm. It is known that end-stage kidney disease impacts quality of life and is often associated with feelings of loss of control or loss of their previous routines.  Employment has a role in feelings of self-sufficiency and productiveness beyond the financial impact. Maintaining employment can be difficult with the time-consuming treatments, disease-related symptoms, or the physical requirements of previous employment. <a href="https://bmcnephrol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12882-021-02552-2">Kirkeskov <em>et al.</em></a> conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis regarding employment rates in adults receiving dialysis or a kidney transplant. They found between January 1966 and August 2020 the employment rate for dialysis patients was 26.3%. This is similar to what is seen in individual countries. <a href="https://cjasn.asnjournals.org/content/13/2/265.long">Erickson <em>et al.</em></a> had a similar percentage (23-24%) among patients starting dialysis in the United States between 1996 and 2013. Kirkeskov <em>et al.</em> also examined employment around the time of transplant.  They found the employment rate was 36.9% pre-transplant and 38.2% post-transplant.</p>
<p>In this article, the predictors for employment during dialysis and post-transplant were male gender, absence of diabetes, peritoneal dialysis, and higher educational level.  This correlates with an older study from 1996 by <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8678064/">Curtin <em>et al.</em></a> In this study, they conducted a survey of dialysis patients to identify characteristics of those employed vs unemployed.  They found that pre-dialysis employment and higher educational level are associated with a significantly higher likelihood of employment rates. Those patients with higher education usually have white-collar jobs, receive salaries greater than disability benefits, often do not have physical requirements related to their work, and have jobs that can provide accommodations for disabilities. While there may be some options such as disability, this often will not provide the same income level as before.</p>
<p>Looking at the dialysis population, many are on disability because they find it too difficult to continue working because of symptoms from end-stage kidney disease, post-dialysis fatigue, or the inability to be able to take on a different role at work. There are several jobs that individuals are not eligible for once they are on certain medications or have certain conditions. Currently, there are not many options for vocational rehabilitation for individuals that can no longer perform their job duties due to having kidney disease.  This further puts a burden on those with reduced resources. Home dialysis modalities may help with some of the challenges by allowing patients for flexibility with the timing of treatments to maintain a routine work schedule. In the <a href="https://bmcnephrol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12882-021-02552-2"><em>BMC Nephrology</em> article</a>, peritoneal dialysis was associated with employment and most likely similar patterns would be seen with home hemodialysis. But, this won’t address all the challenges that impact employment. Advocacy for vocational rehab or for work accommodations such as part-time schedules or to adjust for individuals&#8217; physical limitations needs to be part of the discussion.</p>
<p>Posttransplantation, there is an expectation that individuals can return to more normal routines as they are freed up from dialysis treatments. For those that had been on dialysis for many years prior to transplantation or had to stop working, there may be some challenges of re-entering the workforce. These are considerations that should be part of discussions with health care providers and patients.</p>
<p>What can we do as a nephrology community to help patients stay employed or rejoin the workforce? What resources do patients need?</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/science-discoveries-2021-big-if-true">These discoveries from 2021, if true, could shake up science</a></h4>

              
                <p>Discoveries in 2021 dared the world to consider grand possibilities in physics, space and the origins of life. Will these bold claims hold up to scrutiny?</p>



<h4>Antistarry night</h4>



<p>Scientists may have <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/antimatter-stars-antistars-milky-way-galaxy-space-astronomy">spotted stars made of antimatter</a> (<em>SN: 6/5/21, p. 8</em>). Finding antistars challenges a basic tenet of cosmology — that the vast majority of the universe’s antimatter, matter’s oppositely charged doppelgänger, was destroyed long ago. In 10 years of observations from the Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope, researchers found 14 points of light emitting gamma rays at energies that are expected when matter and antimatter meet and annihilate each other — a process that could happen on the surface of antistars. The discovery hints that substantial amounts of antimatter may have survived. But proving the existence of antistars will be extremely difficult because, aside from the studied gamma rays, the light such stars give off would look just like the light from normal stars.</p>



<h4>Misbehaving muons</h4>



<p>Nothing gets physicists more excited than evidence of a new fundamental particle. Researchers with the Muon g–2 experiment at Fermilab in Batavia, Ill., flung billions of muons around the lab’s giant magnet and found that the rate at which the orientation of the muons’ magnetic poles wobbled strayed from theoretical predictions. The odd behavior suggests that <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/muon-physics-standard-model-particles">hidden particles are influencing the muons’ magnetic properties</a>, challenging the standard model of particle physics describing the universe’s fundamental forces and elementary particles (<em>SN: 5/8/21 &amp; 5/21/21, p. 6</em>). But it will take more data to convince physicists, who are still refining their predictions of muon behavior.</p>

<h4>Cosmic curve ball</h4>



<p>In other news that may upend our understanding of the cosmos, scientists detected <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/galaxy-giant-arc-3-billion-light-years-long-cosmology-space">a giant arc of galaxies</a> stretching across more than 3 billion light-years. Such a finding is counter to the assumption that matter in the universe is evenly distributed on large scales (<em>SN: 7/3/21 &amp; 7/17/21, p. 9</em>). The arc, invisible to the human eye, came to light in an analysis of about 40,000 quasars — very bright cores of distant galaxies. But some skeptics argue that the arc may be just an artifact of the human tendency to pick up patterns where none actually exist.</p>

<h4>Early arrival</h4>



<p>This year brought new evidence that humans arrived in the Americas more than 15,000 years earlier than traditionally thought, throwing support behind last year’s claim that humans <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/science-claims-big-news-if-confirmed-2020">reached North America by about 33,000 years ago</a> (<em>SN: 12/19/20 &amp; 1/2/21, p. 35</em>). In May, researchers reported that animal bones excavated at a cave in Mexico date to <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/americas-ancient-people-arrival-mexico-coxcatlan-cave">between about 33,000 and 28,000 years ago</a> (<em>SN: 7/3/21 &amp; 7/17/21, p. 16</em>). Chipped and sharp-edged stones that may have functioned as tools were found near the bones, hinting that humans had been in the area. And the discovery of fossilized human footprints suggests people <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/footprints-ghost-tracks-prehistoric-humans-americas">roamed what’s now New Mexico around 23,000 to 21,000 years ago</a> (<em>SN: 11/6/21, p. 12</em>). If the tracks’ age is verified, it would show that humans were in North America during the pinnacle of the last ice age.</p>

<h4>Oldest animal fossils?</h4>



<p>Tiny tubes found in 890-million-year old rocks might be remnants of sea sponges. If that claim holds up, the tubes <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/oldest-animal-fossils-tubes-890-million-year-old-rock-ancient-sea-sponge">would push animal origins back by about 350 million years</a> to an oxygen-poor period considered unsuitable for animal life (<em>SN: 8/28/21, p. 6</em>). But some researchers aren’t convinced that the fossils are sea sponges. Skeptics point to the lack of mineralized skeletal parts, known as spicules, that are typical features of sea sponges, and the fact that many non­animal organisms can make similar tubes.</p>

<h4>Extragalactic planet</h4>



<p>Astronomers may have detected the <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/first-exoplanet-discovery-outside-milky-way-galaxy-astronomy">first known planet outside of the Milky Way</a>, in a galaxy about 28 million light-years from Earth (<em>SN: 11/20/21, p. 7</em>). Traditional exoplanet-hunting techniques don’t work well for such distances, so researchers looked to a type of paired star system known as an X-ray binary, which emits bright X-rays. A planet crossing, or transiting, in front of such a system would temporarily block those X-rays, alerting astronomers to the planet’s presence. Some scientists are skeptical because the discovery relied, metaphorically, on many stars to align: The planet needed to transit the X-ray binary while its orbit was perfectly in line with Earth’s point of view, just when a telescope was looking.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/millipede-most-legs-eumillipes-persephone">A 1,306-legged millipede is the first to live up to its name</a></h4>

              
                <p>Millipedes, as we’ve known them, have been a lie. The Latin name for the arthropods implies an impressive set of 1,000 feet. Yet no millipede with more than 750 legs has ever been found, until now.</p>



<p>The <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-021-02447-0">first millipede that lives up to its name</a> uses its 1,306 little legs to tunnel through soil deep beneath the semi-arid scrubland of Western Australia, researchers report December 16 in <em>Scientific Reports</em>. Dubbed <em>Eumillipes persephone</em>, it’s the leggiest creature ever known to crawl Earth.</p>



<p>Researchers nabbed the specimen and seven other curiously long, threadlike millipedes by dropping cups baited with leaf litter into drill holes used for mineral prospecting that were up to 60 meters deep. Eventually, the creatures were sent to entomologist Paul Marek at Virginia Tech in Blacksburg for a closer look.&nbsp;</p>

Marek et al/<em>Scientific Reports</em> 2021</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>The pale, cream-colored millipedes lack eyes, and massive antennae protrude from their drill bit<strong>–</strong>shaped heads — all signs of a subterranean lifestyle, Marek says. While inspecting a 95-millimeter-long female under a microscope, Marek realized he beheld something special. “I was like, Oh my god this has more than 1,000 legs,” he says. With 1,306 tiny feet in total, the specimen has nearly double that of <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/leggiest-animal-champ-millipede-located-after-79-year-gap">the previous record-holder</a> (<em>SN: 6/7/06</em>). “It’s pretty astounding.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>The researchers suspect <em>E. persephone’s</em> elongate, leg-packed body helps the creature maneuver through soil in up to eight different directions at once, like a tangled strand of mobile pasta. “We suspect it feeds on fungi,” Marek says, but the types of fungi living in these deep, dark habitats are unknown.&nbsp;</p>



<p>While <em>E. persephone </em>still holds many secrets, Marek is sure of one thing: “Textbooks are going to have to be changed,” he says. Paragraphs on millipedes will no longer require the caveat that technically, the name is a misnomer. “We finally have a real millipede.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/omicron-coronavirus-covid-variant-severity-antibodies">The omicron variant is surging. Here’s what we’ve learned so far</a></h4>

              
                <p>With omicron spreading globally at a dizzying pace, scientists are scrambling to learn as much as they can about the latest worrisome variant of the coronavirus. First spotted in South Africa and Botswana at the end of November, omicron is already poised to soon become the dominant variant — dethroning delta — in some regions, public health officials warn. In a few places, it already has. So answers, including how sick does omicron make people and how well do vaccines hobble it, can’t come fast enough.</p>



<p>A rising tide of data on omicron is beginning to provide a glimpse at what’s ahead as we enter year three of the global pandemic, though many questions linger. And with many people preparing to gather with family and friends for holidays, experts are bracing for yet more case surges, compounded by already high infection rates in some countries linked to the still-prevalent delta variant.</p>



<aside class="wp-block-sciencenews-inline-related-post alignleft">
<h4>
<a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/editors-picks/2019-novel-coronavirus-outbreak">See all our coverage of the coronavirus outbreak</a>
</h4>
</aside>



<p>Omicron’s collision with the holidays and travel is “a perfect storm,” Thomas Denny, a vaccine expert at Duke University, said December 16 in a call with journalists. At this point, even vaccinated people should be taking precautions, such as wearing masks indoors and testing before family gatherings, he said. “This new variant has thrown us a curve ball at the worst possible time.”</p>





<p>Still, amid the worries, there are positive signals that vaccines can still protect people from the worst of COVID-19. As many countries hurtle toward a season of omicron, here’s what researchers are learning so far.</p>



<h3>Omicron is spreading fast, already outstripping delta in some countries.</h3>



<p>Omicron’s high number of mutations in important viral proteins, and signs that the variant was behind a surge of COVID-19 cases in South Africa, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/omicron-coronavirus-variant-vaccines-mutations">quickly raised red flags</a>, hurling the pandemic into yet another tsunami of uncertainty (<em>SN: 12/1/21</em>).</p>



<p>In the weeks since omicron emerged, the variant has been identified in more than 85 countries. Some, like Denmark, have identified some cases that <a href="https://www.eurosurveillance.org/content/10.2807/1560-7917.ES.2021.26.50.2101146">date before South African researchers revealed omicron’s presence to the world</a> — a hint that the variant had already slipped across borders from wherever it originated before its November discovery. In many of these places, omicron infections are rising fast.</p>



<p>Omicron is responsible for nearly all new COVID-19 cases in South Africa, and is already the predominant version of the coronavirus in London. The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control estimates that omicron will be the <a href="https://www.ecdc.europa.eu/sites/default/files/documents/covid-19-assessment-further-emergence-omicron-18th-risk-assessment-december-2021.pdf">most common variant across the European Union</a> by mid-January.</p>



<p>In the United States, omicron now appears to reign. The variant was responsible for <a href="https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#variant-proportions">an estimated 73.2 percent of new infections</a> across the country for the week ending December 18, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention&#8217;s predictions. That’s up from an estimated 12.6 percent the previous week and 0.7 percent the week ending December 4. Omicron now accounts for an estimated 92 percent of new cases in New York and New Jersey and 96.3 percent in Washington, Oregon and Idaho.</p>



<p>Previous data suggested that estimates of omicron&#8217;s prevalence from earlier in December were lower. It takes time to collect and analyze viruses from patient samples, Bronwyn MacInnis, director of pathogen surveillance at the Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard, said in a December 14 call with journalists. So the numbers can &#8220;change quickly as more data comes in off machines in real time.&#8221;</p>



<p>With that in mind, omicron is likely to worsen the surge that is unfolding across the United States. Some places, including New York City, are already seeing large spikes in COVID-19 cases with numbers rising fast. It currently takes about two days for the number of omicron cases to double, CDC director Rochelle Walensky said December 15 in a White House news briefing. Highly infectious delta, in comparison, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coronavirus-covid-delta-variant-transmission-vaccines">doubled every two weeks</a> at the beginning of its surge in the United States (<em>SN: 7/2/21</em>).</p>



<p>It was a huge question whether omicron would compete with delta for global dominance. Now, some real-world studies show that omicron is coming on strong in many regions. Preliminary data from the United Kingdom show that omicron <a href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/1040076/Technical_Briefing_31.pdf">is around 3.2 times as likely to spread among households as delta is</a>, researchers with Public Health England, a U.K. health agency, reported December 9.</p>



<p>And people exposed to omicron may get sick faster — and therefore be able to spread the virus sooner — than people exposed to other variants. An analysis of an omicron outbreak at a company Christmas party in Norway found that the median time that a person exposed at the party <a href="https://www.eurosurveillance.org/content/10.2807/1560-7917.ES.2021.26.50.2101147">developed symptoms was three days</a>, researchers reported December 16 in <em>Eurosurveillance</em>. It takes slightly longer for delta infections to cause symptoms — around four days — and about five days for non-delta variants. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>The reasons behind omicron’s swift spread are still fuzzy. It could be because omicron is more transmissible than delta or because it can dodge parts of the immune response. Or, more likely, it could be a mixture of both, says Kartik Chandran, a virologist at Albert Einstein College of Medicine in New York City. Some preliminary studies done in lab-grown cells hint that omicron may turn out to be more transmissible than delta, though how much more is unclear. One reason may be because the new variant might <a href="https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.12.14.21267755v1.full.pdf">make more copies of itself inside host cells than other variants do</a>.</p>



<p>Omicron may also replicate <a href="https://www.med.hku.hk/en/news/press/20211215-omicron-sars-cov-2-infection">particularly well in bronchial cells</a> — which line the tubes that deliver air to the lungs — compared with how well it grows in lung tissue, researchers reported December 15 in preliminary data from the University of Hong Kong. If the virus is growing well in bronchial cells, symptoms like coughing could release a lot of viruses into the air.&nbsp;</p>





<h3>It’s still unclear if omicron causes milder disease.</h3>



<p>The Hong Kong results may be a sign that omicron might be less likely than variants like delta to invade the lungs of infected people and cause severe illness, but that’s far from definitive. “I don’t think you can really say that the virus is going to be less virulent based on that data alone,” Chandran says. “We’re going to have to wait and see what happens to people.”&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>There are some hopeful hints from South Africa that omicron might cause less severe disease than what delta causes. But experts caution that it’s far too early to make solid conclusions.</p>



<p>“We should not be lulled into any type of complacency,” Ryan Noach, CEO of Discovery Health, a health insurance provider based in South Africa, said December 14 in a news conference.</p>



<p>The optimism comes because hospitalizations in South Africa aren’t rising as fast as they did in previous surges. What’s more, anecdotal reports from the country suggest that fewer hospitalized patients in the current wave <a href="https://www.samrc.ac.za/news/tshwane-district-omicron-variant-patient-profile-early-features?utm_source=STAT+Newsletters&amp;utm_campaign=1ac774787b-MR_COPY_01&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_term=0_8cab1d7961-1ac774787b-150094665">rely on medical interventions to breathe</a>, such as supplemental oxygen.</p>



<p>That information, however, comes with a massive caveat: More than 70 percent of people there have been exposed to the coronavirus in the last 18 months, Noach said. Protection provided by previous infections, or vaccinations, could be the reason people there tend to have milder symptoms.</p>



<p>Experts need to see what happens in other parts of the world before concluding that omicron is a less virulent virus than other variants, Glenda Gray, president and CEO of the South African Medical Research Council, said at the December 14 news conference. Monitoring the severity of COVID-19 cases in places with low vaccination rates and low infection rates will be particularly informative, she said.</p>



<p>A study from the United Kingdom found that so far there is <a href="https://www.imperial.ac.uk/media/imperial-college/medicine/mrc-gida/2021-12-16-COVID19-Report-49.pdf">no indication that omicron might cause milder, or more severe, COVID-19</a> than delta, researchers report December 17. Data on hospitalizations there, however, are still limited.</p>



<p>Even if omicron is ultimately linked to milder disease, that doesn’t mean it isn’t dangerous. More infections overall mean more hospitalizations and more deaths, even if the severe outcomes are a smaller proportion of overall omicron cases than with delta.</p>



<p>In the United States, where delta dominated until recently, the two variants are colliding — and that’s raising fears of this latest wave turning into a tsunami in some places.</p>



<p>“Our delta surge is ongoing and, in fact, accelerating,” Jacob Lemieux, an infectious diseases physician at Massachusetts General Hospital and Harvard Medical School in Boston, said in a December 14 call with reporters. “On top of that, we’re going to add an omicron surge. That’s alarming because our hospitals are already filling up. Staff are fatigued. We’re almost two years into the pandemic, and there may be limits on capacity to handle the kinds of caseloads that we see from an omicron wave superimposed on a delta surge.”&nbsp;</p>



<h3>Omicron can evade some antibodies.</h3>



<p>Even before omicron began to spread widely, scientists were immediately concerned that it might be able to hide from some virus-attacking antibodies. Recent studies suggest that yes, the virus can evade parts of the immune system. But as our immune defenses are multipronged, it’s not all doom and gloom.</p>



<p>That worry initially came because omicron sports more than 50 mutations in various viral proteins. More than 30 of those changes are in the coronavirus’ spike protein, which helps the virus break into cells and is a major antibody target.</p>



<p>Since December 7, a slew of studies that have yet to be reviewed by other scientists has come out in support of the hypothesis that omicron can evade the immune response, showing that some antibodies don’t recognize omicron very well.</p>



<p>For example, among people vaccinated with two doses of the COVID-19 vaccine made by Pfizer and its German partner BioNTech, levels of immune proteins called neutralizing antibodies that stop the virus from infecting new cells were <a href="https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.12.08.21267417v2.full.pdf">41 times lower compared with antibodies against an older version</a> of the virus that rose to prevalence in mid-2020, researchers report in a preliminary study posted December 11 at medRix.org. Previously infected people <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coronavirus-vaccines-help-covid-infected-already-pandemic">who have been vaccinated</a>, on the other hand, have a leg up (<em>SN: 8/19/21</em>). The study showed that antibody levels against omicron were lower in people who had received two doses of Pfizer&#8217;s shot than in similarly vaccinated individuals who had recovered from a previous infection.</p>



<p>The findings are in line with those from <a href="https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.12.12.21267646v1.full.pdf">multiple</a> <a href="https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.12.14.21267769v1?rss=1%22">other studies</a> that include other vaccines approved in the United States — Moderna’s and Johnson &amp; Johnson’s — as well as ones used globally. The overall magnitude of the antibody drop differs from study to study, but all show the same pattern. Antibodies from people who had previously been infected but not vaccinated also perform poorly against omicron.</p>



<p>What’s more, omicron’s spike mutations may <a href="https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.12.14.21267769v1.full.pdf">make treatments using lab-designed antibodies, called monoclonal antibodies, less effective</a>, researchers report in a preliminary study posted December 14 at medRxiv.org. Out of nine monoclonal antibodies currently in clinical use, only two neutralized omicron in lab-grown cells.</p>



<p>The good news is that a different treatment, a yet-to-be-approved pill from Pfizer called Paxlovid, <a href="https://www.pfizer.com/news/press-release/press-release-detail/pfizer-announces-additional-phase-23-study-results">should still work against the new variant</a>, the company said in a December 14 news release.</p>



<h3>T cells may fare better against omicron than neutralizing antibodies.</h3>



<p>Still, neutralizing antibodies that circulate in the blood are only one small piece of the immune response. Another arm appears largely undamaged.</p>



<p>Immune cells called T cells can either raise the call to arms when they detect the coronavirus or are capable of killing infected cells. T cells patrol the body searching for signs of the coronavirus. The cells identify fragments of viral proteins by doing cellular handshakes to check if cells are sending up red flags that the coronavirus has invaded. A red flag kicks the immune response into high gear.</p>



<p>It seems that many of the viral fragments that T cells recognize <a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.12.06.471446v1">aren’t the parts of omicron with mutations</a>, researchers report in a preliminary study posted December 9 at bioRxiv.org, meaning the immune cells will probably still help protect people from getting really sick.</p>

<h3>Omicron seems more likely to cause reinfections than delta.</h3>



<p>Immunity against infection wanes in the months afterward. That combined with the immune evasiveness of omicron has raised the odds that previously infected people might get infected again.</p>



<p>Data from the United Kingdom, for instance, suggest that recovered people are <a href="https://www.imperial.ac.uk/media/imperial-college/medicine/mrc-gida/2021-12-16-COVID19-Report-49.pdf">five times as likely to be infected by omicron</a> as by delta, researchers from Imperial College London report December 19.</p>



<p>The same appears to be true in South Africa. People who caught the virus in South Africa’s first wave, which was driven by a variant called D614G, are 73 percent as likely to get reinfected with omicron as people without known prior infections. That’s higher than the 29 percent higher risk for recovered people in September and October 2021, when delta was prevalent there. Individuals infected in the second wave caused by the beta variant face a 60 percent higher risk, up from 27 percent in September and October. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<h3>Vaccines may be less effective against omicron, but boosters offer hope.</h3>



<p>Early studies suggest that vaccines will still protect us, especially after getting a booster shot.</p>



<p>Lab-based studies of neutralizing antibody responses are a hint that protection from vaccines or previous infection might be diminished. Many of these same studies suggest that a <a href="https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.12.14.21267769v1?rss=1%22">third dose boosts antibodies back up to levels that should be protective against omicron</a>.</p>



<p>Boosters can even provide more protection than the original shots because the body churns out antibodies that have evolved to better recognize the virus every time we’re exposed to its proteins, Chandran says. So after a boost, the body doesn’t just make more antibodies, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/covid-19-immunity-antibodies-persist-six-months-coronavirus">they’re better ones</a>, too (<em>SN: 11/24/20</em>). But because the immune response to infections is complex and varies from person to person, experts rely on studies from people in the real world to know for sure.</p>



<p>A study in South Africa, for instance, found that the <a href="https://www.discovery.co.za/corporate/news-room#/documents/press-release-dot-pdf-417948">effectiveness of two doses of Pfizer’s vaccine at stopping infection dropped</a> from 80 percent pre-omicron to 33 percent during the omicron wave. There was a less dramatic drop in the shot’s effectiveness at preventing hospitalization. Before omicron, the jab was 93 percent effective; it decreased to 70 percent amid the new surge.</p>



<p>“It’s very heartening to see these results,” Gray, of the South African Medical Research Council, said at the December 14 news conference. Though the study didn’t look at the effect of booster shots, another dose should bring the vaccines’ effectiveness back up, she said. Analyses for comparing one or two doses of J&amp;J’s COVID-19 vaccine are ongoing and should have results soon, Gray added.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The findings are similar to early estimates out of the United Kingdom, which show Pfizer’s two-dose shot is around 30 percent effective against symptoms. A booster dose <a href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/1040076/Technical_Briefing_31.pdf">increased the effectiveness to between 70 percent to 75 percent</a>, according to data from Public Health England. Still, there’s a lot of uncertainty because those findings are based on low numbers of cases. As time passes and more people get infected, researchers will get better estimates.</p>



<p>In the meantime, the worry about omicron has sparked a flurry of activity. People around the globe are upping their layers of protection with vaccinations, masks and pre-holiday COVID-19 tests. Experts expect that vaccines will largely keep vaccinated people out of the hospital. But with many people still unvaccinated across the United States, only time will tell whether the beginning of 2022 will be as devastating as the start of 2021.</p>



<p>“We are now waist-deep in the omicron wave,” infectious diseases physician Lemieux said in a December 20 call with journalists. The big question is how large the country’s omicron wave will be and what impact it will have on the health care system.</p>

                <p><em>By</em> <a href="https://emmayoung.net/">Emma Young</a></p>



<p>Watching lecture videos is now a major part of many students’ university experience. Some say they prefer them to live lectures, as they can choose when to study. And, according to a survey of students at the University of California Los Angeles, at least, many students also take advantage of the fact that video playback can be sped up, so cutting the amount of time they spend on lectures. But what impact does sped-up viewing have on learning? The answer, according to a <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/acp.3899?af=R">new paper</a> in <em>Applied Cognitive Psychology</em>, is, within some limits, none. In fact, if used strategically, it can actually improve learning. However, what students <em>think</em> is going to be the best strategy isn’t actually what’s most beneficial, Dillon Murphy at UCLA and colleagues also report.</p>



<span id="more-44922"></span>



<p>First, the team assigned 231 student participants to watch two YouTube videos (one on real estate appraisals and the other on the Roman Empire) at normal speed, 1.5x speed, 2x speed or 2.5x speed. They were told to watch the videos in full screen mode and not to pause them or take any notes. After each video, the students took comprehension tests, which were repeated a week later. The results were clear: the 1.5x and 2x groups did just as well on the tests as those who’d watched the videos at normal speed, both immediately afterwards and one week on. Only at 2.5x was learning impaired.</p>



<p>When the team surveyed a separate group of UCLA students, they found that a massive 85% usually watched pre-recorded lectures at faster than normal speed. However, 91% said they thought that normal speed or slightly faster (1.5x) would be better for learning than 2x or 2.5x. These new results certainly suggest that this isn’t right: double-time viewing was just as good as normal viewing. It seems, then, that as long as the material can still be accurately perceived and comprehended, it’s okay to speed up playback.</p>



<p>So, a student could just watch videos at 2x speed and halve their time spent on lectures….Or, according to the results of other studies reported in the paper, they could watch a video at 2x normal speed twice, and do <em>better</em> on a test than if they’d watched it once at normal speed. The timing mattered, though: only those who’d watched the 2x video for a second time immediately before a test, rather than right after the first viewing, got this advantage.</p>



<p>The team also explored whether watching the videos at different speeds on separate occasions — initially at normal speed but then at double time, or vice versa — might make a difference to test performance immediately afterwards or a week later. Though 76% of the participants in this study said they thought watching first at normal speed then rewatching at double time would be best for learning, the order actually made no difference to test results. “Thus, although students may prefer certain study schedules or techniques, there are instances where their beliefs about self-regulated learning do not enhance learning outcomes,” the team writes.</p>



<p>The results offer some guidance for students at US universities considering the optimal revision strategy. In a standard college course, a midterm exam might test on material contained in 10 hours’ of lecture videos. So a student might want to watch them in double time when they are released and then again in double time just before the exam. However, the team did only look at one-week delays between video watching and testing, so this would need to be explored in further research.</p>



<p>The researchers do also add a few caveats. While 2x viewing was fine for learning about the material in their studies — real estate appraisals and the Roman Empire — perhaps it might not work for more complex subject matter; again, only more research will tell.</p>



<p>But as so many students do report watching at faster than normal speeds anyway, this work is clearly helpful: it suggests that as long as it’s not more than 2x faster, it’s far from being a bad idea.</p>

<h4>Sea slugs that grow new bodies</h4>



<p>In a spectacular feat of whole-body regeneration, some <em>Elysia</em> sea slugs <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/sea-slug-detached-head-crawl-regenerate-grow-new-body">can grow a new body from just the head</a> (<em>SN: 4/10/21, p. 4</em>). This feat may come in handy when animals are riddled with parasites and need a fresh start. The head simply detaches itself, crawls away and regrows an entirely new body, including the heart. These are the only animals with a heart that are known to regenerate so much of themselves.</p>

<h4>Squirrels that parkour</h4>





<p>We’ve all seen squirrels pull off death-defying maneuvers, but now we know more about how the rodents pull off their stunts. Like masters of parkour — the sport in which people leap, bounce and climb through an obstacle course — <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/squirrel-jump-leap-tree-branch-parkour-tricks">squirrels gauge the bendiness of branches when jumping</a>. The rodents also use parkour-style jumps off of vertical surfaces to slow down and stick landings, researchers found (<em>SN: 8/28/21, p. 14</em>).</p>

</div><figcaption>Researchers trained squirrels to jump through an artificial forest obstacle course to study how they leap from branch to branch without falling. High-speed camera footage showed that squirrels can learn to stick landings in just a few jumps and consider both branch bendiness and distance when deciding to leap from a limb.</figcaption></figure>





<h4>Animals that eat surprising animals</h4>



<p>This year upended notions of predator and prey, revealing animals making meals of one another in surprising ways. Researchers found that <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/spiders-eat-snakes-biology">more than 40 species from 11 families of spiders eat snakes</a>, using sticky silk and venomous bites to subdue serpents up to 30 times their size (<em>SN Online: 8/4/21</em>). </p>

<p>What’s more, one Seychelles giant tortoise apparently didn’t get the memo that tortoises are gentle herbivores. It was spotted stalking, catching and eating a bird chick whole, the <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/giant-tortoise-video-hunting-killing-eating-baby-bird">first documented example of a tortoise hunting prey</a> (<em>SN: 9/25/21, p. 5</em>).</p>

<h4>A beetle that walks on water, underwater</h4>



<p>A <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/robot-springs-water">water strider</a>’s ability to walk on water is incredible enough, but the tiny water scavenger beetle flips the script: It <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/beetles-walk-on-water-upside-down-underneath-surface">walks on water upside down</a>, clinging to the water’s surface from below (<em>SN: 7/31/21, p. 13</em>). The insect may use a small air bubble to pin its belly to the underside of the water’s surface, but just how it steps without breaking the water’s surface tension remains a mystery for now.</p>

<h4>A bird that mimics a flock</h4>



<p>The male superb lyrebird lives up to its name with its excellent vocal abilities, mimicking nearly any sound it hears in its Australian forest home — even chainsaws and cameras. Now scientists have recorded the bird <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/lyrebird-mimic-entire-flock-deception-male-mating-call">mimicking the sounds of several other bird species at once</a> — replicating an entire soundscape. It’s the only known animal with this talent (<em>SN: 3/27/21, p. 12</em>). Because the lyrebird mimics multiple alarm calls in particular, researchers aren’t sure if it’s also trying to sound an alarm or just showing off for mates.</p>

</div><figcaption>At the close of trying to impress a female with an elaborate song and dance, the male lyrebird adds a remarkable flourish.

<h4>Spiders that lift prey up to 50 times their own weight</h4>



<p>In an innovative take on a pulley system, some spiders, including black widows, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/tiny-spider-uses-silk-lift-prey-50-times-its-own-weight-video">can hoist heavy prey up, up and into their webs</a> using only strands of their silk (<em>SN: 2/27/21, p. 13</em>). Researchers observed the spiders attaching strand after strand from their main web to large prey such as lizards, with each strand just a bit shorter than the last so that the stretchy silk slowly reeled in the prize.</p>

</div><figcaption>Filmed in a lab box, a&nbsp;spider tries to capture a much bigger roach to feast on. The spider attaches one silk strand after another to the struggling roach until the silk supports all of the roach’s weight. Then the spider keeps adding shorter and shorter strands that tug the monster weight of the prey up toward the main part of the web.</figcaption></figure>



<h4>Polar bears that wield weapons</h4>



<p>In a macabre example of tool use by animals, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/polar-bears-bludgeon-walrus-stones-tools-ice-inuit">polar bears sometimes kill walrus by bashing them with large chunks of stone or ice</a> (<em>SN: 8/28/21, p. 16</em>). Inuit hunters have long reported polar bears attacking prey this way, and a review of historical and modern documentation confirms that stone-wielding polar bears are a real phenomenon. This puts polar bears on the list of tool-using animals, including crows, chimpanzees, elephants and, of course, humans.</p>

                <p>When I was in grad school, I wrote a lot of code which ended up biting me later. It wasn&#8217;t until I got a job as a software engineer at Google that I discovered better ways of organizing code. Writing reusable, easy-to-read code is a core skill to have when you&#8217;re spending half of your grad school days in front of the computer. </p>



<p>I realized that others might be interested in learning these core skills, and so I tweeted out a feeler, and I was really overwhelmed with responses. I gave a workshop to the grad students in neuro at Harvard, then at NMA 2021, and it seemed to really hit a nerve. I took a couple of weeks off to write a long-form version and went through several rounds of editing and improving, and now it&#8217;s finally ready for primetime. Enjoy!</p>

<p>About the tech behind the book: it&#8217;s all writing in markdown. <a href="http://jupyterbook.org/">Jupyterbook </a>takes care of translating markdown to html. I heavily customized the sphinx-book-theme template to use <a href="https://github.com/edwardtufte/tufte-css">tufte.css</a> to make it look and feel like a book. A nice bonus is that tufte.css has a dark theme that&#8217;s easy on the eyes. The project is hosted on Github and deployed through netlify. </p>

                <p>From a record-setting black hole to the oldest animal DNA ever recovered, discoveries in 2021 stretched the limits of scientific study — and our imaginations.</p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator" />



<h3>Oldest behemoth black hole</h3>



<p>More than 13 billion years ago, when the universe was a mere 670 million years old, a black hole was born. At a mass equal to 1.6 billion suns, the newly discovered supermassive black hole J0313-1806 is <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/most-ancient-supermassive-black-hole-quasar-bafflingly-big">twice as heavy and 20 million years older</a> than the previous record holder for oldest known black hole (<em>SN: 2/13/21, p. 4</em>). The ancient behemoth is so big that it challenges notions of how supermassive black holes first formed, astronomers say.</p>

<h3>Gravity on the smallest scale</h3>



<p>Every object with mass has gravity too, according to both Isaac Newton and Albert Einstein, even if it’s barely noticeable. Scientists have now measured the gravity of a gold ball 2 millimeters wide and weighing about 90 milligrams — the <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/physics-gravity-measurement-smallest-object-mass-gold-ball">smallest object ever to have its gravitational pull measured</a> (<em>SN: 4/10/21, p. 5</em>). The tiny tug revealed that gravity behaves as predicted, even for very small masses. Researchers still want to test how gravity behaves on the even smaller quantum scale, where different rules of physics may apply.</p>

<h3>Oldest opposable thumbs</h3>



<p>A 160-million-year-old pterosaur nicknamed Monkeydactyl is now the <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/monkeydactyl-jurassic-pterosaur-oldest-fossil-opposable-thumbs">earliest known animal with opposable thumbs</a> (<em>SN: 5/8/21 &amp; 5/22/21, p. 16</em>). The flying reptile, officially named <em>Kunpengopterus antipollicatus</em>, may have used its thumbs and flexible joints to clamber up and through trees in what is now northeastern China. The digits could have helped it capture insects and other prey, scientists say.</p>

Astronomers detected the event by measuring gravitational waves that emanated from the collision and eventually reached Earth (<em>SN: 7/31/21, p. 6</em>). All previously identified sources of these ripples in spacetime consisted of two like objects colliding, such as two neutron stars or two black holes.</p>

<h3>Oldest recovered animal DNA</h3>



<p>The tooth of a Siberian <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/oldest-animal-dna-ever-recovered-mammoth-evolution">mammoth that lived more than a million years ago</a> has offered up the oldest DNA ever recovered from an animal (<em>SN: 3/13/21, p. 6</em>). The previous record holder was 700,000-year-old DNA from a fossilized horse. Scientists say the new find probably approaches the limit of how long DNA can persist. Genes from the mammoth suggest that it may have belonged to a previously unknown species.</p>

<h3>Most Denisovan DNA</h3>



<p>The mysterious hominid group known as the Denisovans died out long ago, but not without leaving a trace. The Indigenous Ayta Magbukon people of the Philippines <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/indigenous-people-philippines-denisovan-dna-genetics">get about 5 percent of their DNA from Denisovans</a>, a genetic analysis revealed (<em>SN: 9/11/21, p. 16</em>). That’s the highest level of Denisovan ancestry yet found anywhere in the world. Researchers are using the result, along with genetic clues from other groups that carry Denisovan DNA, to retrace Denisovans’ movements through Southeast Asia, Papua New Guinea and Australia.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/vikings-greenland-rising-sea-level-climate">Vikings may have fled Greenland to escape rising seas</a></h4>

              
                <p>In 1721, a Norwegian missionary set sail for Greenland in the hopes of converting the Viking descendants living there to Protestantism. When he arrived, the only traces he found of the Nordic society were ruins of settlements that had been abandoned 300 years earlier.</p>



<p>There is no written record to explain why the Vikings left or died out. But a new simulation of Greenland’s coastline reveals that as the ice sheet covering most of the island started to expand around that time, <a href="https://agu.confex.com/agu/fm21/meetingapp.cgi/Paper/810519">sea levels rose drastically</a>, researchers report December 15 at the American Geophysical Union’s fall meeting in New Orleans.</p>



<p>These shifting coastlines would have inundated grazing areas and farmland, and could have helped bring about the end of the Nordic way of life in Greenland, says Marisa Borreggine, a geophysicist at Harvard University.</p>



<p>Greenland was first colonized by Vikings in 985 by a group of settlers in 14 ships led by Erik the Red, who had been banished from neighboring Iceland for manslaughter. Erik and his followers settled across southern Greenland, where they and their descendants hunted for seals, grazed livestock, built churches and traded walrus ivory with European mainlanders.</p>





<p>The settlers arrived during what’s known as the <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/global-warming-today-unlike-last-2000-years-climate-shifts">Medieval Warm Period</a>, when conditions across Europe and Greenland were temperate for a handful of centuries (<em>SN: 7/24/19</em>). But by 1350, the climate had started taking a turn for the worse with the beginning of the Little Ice Age, a period of regional cooling that lasted well into the 19th century.</p>



<p>Researchers have long speculated that a rapidly changing climate could have dealt a blow to Greenland’s Norse society. The island probably became much colder in the last 100 years of Norse occupation, says paleoclimatologist Boyang Zhao at Brown University in Providence, R.I, who was not involved in the new research. Lower temperatures could have made farming and raising livestock more difficult, he says.&nbsp;</p>



<p>These lower temperatures would have had another impact on Greenland: the steady expansion of the island’s ice sheet, Borreggine and colleagues say.</p>



<p>Though rising sea levels usually go hand in hand with ice melting from ice sheets, oceans do not rise and fall uniformly in every place, Borreggine says. Around Greenland, sea level tends to rise when the ice sheet there grows.</p>



<p>This is for two main reasons: First, ice is heavy. The sheer weight of the ice sheet pushes the land it rests on down, meaning that as the ice sheet grows, more land is submerged. Second is gravity. Being massive, ice sheets exert some gravitational pull on nearby water. This makes the seawater around Greenland tilt upward toward the ice, meaning that water closer to the coast is higher than water in the open ocean. As the ice sheet grows, that pull becomes even stronger, and sea level close to the coast rises further.</p>



<p>Simulating the impact of the weight of the ice and its tug on Greenland’s waters, Borreggine and their colleagues found that sea level rose enough to flood the coast by hundreds of meters in some areas. Between the time the Vikings arrived and when they left, there was “pretty intense coastal flooding, such that certain pieces of land that were connected to each other were no longer connected,” they say. &nbsp;</p>



<p>Today, some Viking sites are being inundated as a result of the overall rise in global sea level from climate change, which is being only marginally offset around Greenland by its melting ice sheet. Something similar could have happened back in the 14th and 15th centuries, destroying land that the Norse relied on for farming and grazing, Borreggine says.</p>



<p>“Previous theories about why Vikings left have really focused on the idea that they all died because it got really cold, and they were too dumb to adapt,” Borreggine says. But they say that archaeological digs have revealed a far more nuanced story, showing that Greenland’s Norse people did change their lifestyle by increasingly relying on seafood in the last century of their occupation.</p>



<p>But learning to adapt may have been too difficult in the face of an increasingly harsh landscape. The idea that rising sea levels may have been one of these challenges has merit, Zhao says, noting that the reasons why the Vikings disappeared from Greenland is nuanced.</p>



<p>As the climate changed, for example, these people may have also found themselves increasingly cut off from trade routes as the season for thick sea ice extended. And by the mid-14th century, the Black Plague was tearing through Europe, cutting into the Vikings’ biggest market for walrus ivory.</p>



<p>“Norse people came and left,” Zhao says. “But there are still a lot of unsolved questions,” including why exactly they left, he says.</p>



<p>The last written record of this society is a letter describing a wedding in 1408. A few years later, that couple moved to Iceland and started farming. Why the pair chose to leave is lost to history, but, as the new research suggests, sea level rise may have been part of the equation.&nbsp;</p>

Does “overeating” cause obesity? The evidence is less filling</h2><p>The usual way of thinking considers obesity a problem of energy balance. Take in more calories than you expend—in other words, “overeat”—and weight gain will inevitably result. The simple solution, according to the prevailing Energy Balance Model (EBM), is to eat less and move more. New research shows that viewing body weight control as an energy balance problem is fundamentally wrong, or at least not helpful, for three reasons.</p><p>Discover the three reasons in this blog post from David S.

                <p><em>By</em> <a href="https://emmayoung.net/">Emma Young</a></p>



<p>&#8220;But they won’t hurt you! They eat bugs. They’re our friends!&#8221; I’ve tried telling my now-12-year-old all these things many times over the years, but his fear of spiders persists. It’s hardly a rare fear; an estimated 6% of the general population suffer from full-blown arachnophobia. The leading explanation is that our ancestors evolved to fear spiders, and this has been passed on to us. But there are a few problems with this, point out the authors of a <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-021-01325-z">new paper</a> in <em>Scientific Reports</em>.</p>



<p>Firstly: only 0.5% of spider species are potentially dangerous to humans. Secondly: these species are mostly found not in Africa, where modern humans evolved, but rather Australia and South America, the two continents that have been most recently colonised by people. Given this, the idea of an evolved, generalised fear of spiders doesn’t seem that compelling. Daniel Frynta at Charles University, Prague, and colleagues had another idea: perhaps we evolved to fear not “essentially harmless” spiders but a dangerous close relative with a similar body body plan: scorpions — and our brains over-generalise, reacting to spiders in the same way. To investigate this, they ran a study that would have left my 12-year-old with nightmares for months…</p>



<span id="more-44915"></span>



<p>The team collected together live specimens of 62 arthropod species: 15 spiders, 10 scorpions, 5 other arachnids (such as whip &#8220;spiders&#8221;), 10 cockroaches, 10 other &#8220;hemimetabolous insects&#8221; (a group that includes earwigs, stick insects and locusts), 6 myriapods (centipedes, millipedes and their relatives), 4 beetles and 2 crabs. Each of these animals was placed in a transparent box. These boxes were then lined up for inspection by 329 participants, who used 7-point scales to rate each on scales for fear, disgust and also beauty.</p>



<p>Let’s get beauty out of the way first: species that got high disgust ratings tended to get low beauty ratings, but there was no link between beauty and fear ratings. In other words, we can find an arthropod both scary and beautiful.</p>



<p>For fear, the team noted that the taxa fell into distinct groups. The &#8220;chelicerates&#8221; (the spiders, scorpions and other arachnids) got relatively high average scores, followed by the myriapods (which were definitely less fear-inducing) and finally the insects and crustaceans.</p>



<p>For disgust, the pattern was similar to that for fear. Myriapods did get the highest average score, but it wasn’t far off the score for spiders. Again, the beetles and crabs got the lowest scores. Overall, the fear and disgust ratings were highly correlated.</p>



<p>Bigger species did tend to trigger stronger emotional reactions — they got higher fear, disgust and beauty scores. But the deepest statistical split in the fear-and-disgust ratings was between the chelicerates cluster (spiders/scorpions/other arachnids) and a cluster of insects-plus-crustaceans. “This supports the notion that chelicerates are perceived as one cohesive group distinct from other arthropods,” the team argues.</p>



<p>Unlike the vast majority of spiders, scorpions <em>do</em> post a genuine threat, killing an estimated 2,600 people every year. Scorpions are also an ancient group, and species with a venom tailored to mammals are native to Africa and the Middle East — so our distant ancestors and dangerous scorpions could have evolved side-by-side. “Fear of scorpions therefore seems to be better warranted than fear of spiders,” the team writes.</p>



<p>Of course, the data don’t <em>show</em> that people generalise an evolved fear/disgust of scorpions to spiders. As the team acknowledges, this is a big limitation of the study. But it’s a sensible way to interpret the data, they argue. And, compared with other theories about why so many people are so scared of spiders (over dogs, say), it does indeed seem more compelling.</p>

<p><strong>Sterility gene for mosquito control</strong> — <em><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/environment-29">Science News</a></em>, December 18, 1971</p>



<p>Scientists are working hard to find a substitute for DDT in the control of malaria vector mosquitoes.… Two experiments with mosquitoes breeding in old tires in New Delhi point to an answer: a gene for sterility that would be passed to offspring.</p>



<h4>Update</h4>



<p>Today, scientists are testing a variety of pesticide-free ways to control mosquito populations that spread malaria, Zika, dengue and yellow fever. One approach involves <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/florida-theyre-fighting-mosquitoes-meddling-their-sex-lives">infecting male bloodsuckers with a strain of <em>Wolbachia</em> bacteria</a> (<em>SN: 6/10/17, p. 10</em>). When the infected males mate with females, their offspring die before hatching. Another method tweaks mosquito DNA so that males pass on a daughter-killing trait and all female offspring die, shrinking populations over time. The mosquitoes, bred by the England-based biotech company Oxitec, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/mosquito-genetically-modified-us-florida-keys-pest-control-zika-dengue">took their first U.S. flight in May</a> following a years-long debate about the safety of such organisms.</p>

                <img width="140" height="110" src="https://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2021/12/Bloods-140x110.jpeg" class="attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image" alt="" style="display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear:both;" /><p>Up to 50% of intensive care unit stays are complicated by acute kidney injury (AKI). This is associated with increased length of stay within the hospital, higher in-hospital death, higher healthcare cost, and risk for development of chronic kidney disease (CKD) and/or CKD progression.</p>
<p>Biomarkers have recently become of interest for the potential role in AKI prevention in high-risk patients, early diagnosis of AKI, identification of different renal diseases, and progression of AKI and underlying kidney disease. Biomarkers are various substances that can be found in the blood or urine which might suggest some injury or disease, and in our context kidney injury. There is a hope these biomarkers will offer a noninvasive, reliable means of testing and guiding AKI management.</p>
<p>In a study published in <a href="https://bmcnephrol.biomedcentral.com/"><em>BMC Nephrology </em></a>this week, <a href="http://to pub.">Tao <em>et al</em>.</a> studied the potential of a few biomarkers independently and in combination as predictors of sepsis-induced AKI progression. The group studied the product of urinary tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases-2 (TIMP2) and insulin-like growth factor binding protein 7 (IGFBP7) (u[TIMP-2]*[IGFBP7]), urinary kidney injury molecular-1 (uKIM-1), and urinary interleukin-18 (uIL-18).</p>
<p>TIMP-2 and IGFBP7 are released in the urine as a response to renal epithelial cell stress and are mediators of cell cycle arrest in tubular epithelial cells. Each of these markers has been demonstrated to predict cardiac surgery-associated AKI, but the product of these urine biomarker levels has shown to be more informative (see Table).<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25229339/"> KIM-1</a> and <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22383693/">IL-18</a> suggest renal tubular damage and inflammation related to AKI. These biomarkers were shown in other studies to reflect the prediction of the progression of AKI.</p>

<blockquote><p>Current research suggests that the value may not be with a single marker but in the combinations of these markers.</p></blockquote>
<p>In this study, Tao <em>et al.</em> demonstrated that all of these markers independently predicted progression of sepsis-induced AKI, but u[TIMP-2]*[IGFBP7] showed the best prediction. They did note that a combination of u[TIMP2]*[IGFBP7] with uKIM-1 improved the performance of predicting sepsis-induced AKI progression.</p>
<p>There are hundreds of other biomarkers being explored for high-risk, early detection, and progression of AKI. Current research suggests that the value may not be with a single marker but in the combinations of these markers. Introducing markers as clinical tools may have several benefits, such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>Early identification of patients at high risk of AKI;</li>
<li>Early implementation of renal protective measures such as <a href="https://kdigo.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/KDIGO-2012-AKI-Guideline-English.pdf">KDIGO</a> <a href="https://kdigo.org/guidelines/acute-kidney-injury/">bundles</a> (i.e. AKI <a href="https://www.karger.com/Article/FullText/437152">care</a> bundles) and nephrotoxin avoidance;</li>
<li>Avoiding complications related to AKI and the need for kidney replacement therapy</li>
</ul>
<p>As of right now, biomarkers are costly, not readily available, and some are too specific or too sensitive. Could using a biomarker be helpful or lead to more unnecessary testing and treatment that leads to more healthcare costs? More research needs to be done before these markers can be used in clinical settings as potential tools for determining prognosis and guiding the clinical management of patients with acute kidney injury.</p>
<p>If these biomarkers were made available to you as a clinical tool, will you be using them?</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coronavirus-covid-19-testing-questions-vaccines-variants-accuracy">COVID-19 testing is complicated right now. Here are answers to 6 big questions</a></h4>

              
                <p>A friend texted me recently because her daughter’s class had a coronavirus outbreak and my friend had some questions about COVID-19 testing.</p>



<p>Testing has been on lots of other people’s minds and in the news lately, too. President Joe Biden announced recently that insurance providers must reimburse people for at-home coronavirus tests, and millions of tests will be available for people who don’t have insurance. Some people are making testing part of their routines before holiday gatherings.</p>



<p>Yet COVID-19 tests aren’t easy to come by everywhere. Consumers have complained that their pharmacies are sold out and that testing centers in some places <a href="https://twitter.com/HelenBranswell/status/1470396008555286530">have long lines</a>. And even if you can get your hands on a test, many folks — like my friend — have questions. In particular, she wanted to know if her daughter’s recent vaccine shot would interfere with the results of her home test.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Here are some answers to that and other queries.</p>





<h4>What do COVID-19 tests measure?</h4>



<p>There are two major categories of <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coronavirus-covid19-rapid-tests-rna-virus">diagnostic tests</a> you might encounter: antigen tests and nucleic acid amplification tests, better known as PCR tests. Both can determine whether you have a current infection with SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19. You can find a list of tests available in stores or at testing sites in the United States <a href="https://www.centerforhealthsecurity.org/covid-19TestingToolkit/molecular-based-tests/current-molecular-and-antigen-tests.html">here</a>. (Antibody tests aren’t diagnostic tests: They can detect evidence of past infections, but not current cases.)&nbsp;</p>

<p>The PCR (polymerase chain reaction) test determines whether there is viral RNA in the swab or saliva sample being tested. Those tests are the ones you would encounter most often at the doctor’s office or other testing centers, and some at-home tests allow people to swab themselves and mail the samples to a lab for PCR testing. Those tests work by first converting any of the virus’s RNA in the sample into DNA. If any of the viral genetic material is present, then <a href="https://www.centerforhealthsecurity.org/covid-19TestingToolkit/testing-basics/types-of-COVID-19-tests/diagnostic-tests/molecular-tests.html">multiple rounds of copying short pieces of certain viral genes </a>should produce a signal. That would be a positive test result.</p>



<p>Many of the at-home kits are antigen tests, which probe for certain viral proteins. Most of the rapid antigen tests look for the coronavirus’s nucleocapsid, or N protein. That protein helps package the viral RNA.&nbsp;</p>



<h4>How accurate are the tests?</h4>



<p>Both types of tests are accurate but have strengths and weaknesses. Because of their round robin copycatting, PCR tests are very sensitive and can pick up small amounts of viral RNA, including before a person becomes contagious. The downside is that the test can still pick up RNA debris even after people have ceased making infectious viruses, potentially making people seem contagious when they aren’t.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>At-home kits aren’t as sensitive as the PCR tests, but “the rapid antigen tests are really great, particularly if you’re symptomatic, to determine whether you have COVID at that moment,” says Gigi Gronvall, an immunologist and senior scholar at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security. “They rival PCR for accuracy for that time” when people are symptomatic and most likely to be contagious to others.</p>



<p>But a negative test result doesn’t necessarily mean that you aren’t infected. It just means that the test didn’t detect the virus at that time.</p>



<p>“All tests are a moment in time,” Gronvall says. “There’s always going to be a moment like when you’re watching a sunrise when the light hasn’t yet come above the horizon. It’s not like the sun isn’t there. … You won’t know the day or the hour when the virus is starting to make copies of itself,” she says. For that reason, experts advise doing several rapid antigen tests a few days apart.&nbsp;</p>



<p>That’s something to keep in mind when deciding when to test over the holidays, too. Do a rapid antigen test before you go to a party to get some assurance that you’re likely not contagious to others right then. But if you’re worried that you were exposed to the virus during the celebration, “testing as soon as you get home from the party isn’t going to do much good,” Gronvall says. Health experts advise waiting five to seven days after exposure to take a test, but people are often testing positive within three to five days with the delta variant, she says. It’s unknown how long it might take to get a positive result if infected with the omicron variant.</p>





<h4>Do vaccines interfere with COVID-19 diagnostic tests?</h4>



<p>At first glance, it seems logical that a vaccine might give wonky test results. The mRNA vaccines from Pfizer and Moderna and Johnson &amp; Johnson’s DNA vaccine all contain instructions for building the coronavirus’s spike protein. A PCR test might pick up on that signal, right?</p>



<p>It turns out that many PCR tests probe for multiple viral genes, including ones encoding the spike and N proteins, &nbsp;but also for an RNA polymerase that copies the virus’s genetic material and for the virus’s envelope, or E protein. A test is positive if it picks up on all of its target markers. But a signal from the vaccines’ spike protein alone isn’t enough to send up a red flag. Also the mRNA in the vaccines doesn’t stick around for long in the body, 24 to 72 hours. So the vaccines do not interfere with accurate PCR test results.</p>



<p>Most of the antigen tests detect the N protein, not the spike protein. So even if the vaccine works spectacularly well and your body is pumping out spike protein at levels that you’d get with an active infection, the antigen test would ignore it, so it won’t interfere with those test results either.</p>



<h4>Can the tests detect viral variants? &nbsp;</h4>



<p>The delta variant can’t fool either test. Omicron, however, is missing nine RNA building blocks called nucleotides in the N gene. That could <a href="https://www.fda.gov/medical-devices/coronavirus-covid-19-and-medical-devices/sars-cov-2-viral-mutations-impact-covid-19-tests#omicron">lead to false negatives</a> on a PCR test from Tide Laboratories used in more than 30 locations around the country, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration reports. That particular test probes for only the N gene, so the missing pieces are a problem. But antigen tests can still pick up on the N protein despite the absent bit.</p>



<aside class="wp-block-sciencenews-inline-related-post alignleft">
<h4>
<a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/editors-picks/2019-novel-coronavirus-outbreak">See all our coverage of the coronavirus outbreak</a>
</h4>
</aside>



<p>Omicron is also missing a bit of the spike protein that causes what’s called “S gene dropout” in 26 PCR tests from various manufacturers, meaning that the spike gene isn’t detected even though the person is infected. That’s generally not a problem since those tests are looking for multiple viral genes. In fact, the missing spike signal may be a clue that a person is infected with omicron rather than delta and that their sample should be examined more closely. Alpha and some other variants also caused S gene dropout, so it’s not a slam dunk that the missing spike heralds an omicron infection.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>On the flip side, a second version of omicron that has been spotted in some places doesn’t cause S gene dropout. So a sample might test positive for the S gene and other markers and be mistaken for a delta variant infection, when it is really omicron.</p>



<h4>Should I use a rapid at-home test or go in for a PCR test?</h4>



<p>“It’s really a matter of time and what you need it for,” Gronvall says.&nbsp;</p>



<p>When people have been exposed to someone with COVID-19, but don’t have symptoms themselves, a PCR test could pick up a low-level infection possibly before people become infectious to others. “That could buy you a little time” to isolate and prevent spreading the virus to others, Gronvall says. But it may take a couple of days for some PCR test results to come in, erasing that advantage.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Rapid tests could be useful for people who have symptoms of COVID-19 and need to know quickly if they are contagious to others. New <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/covid-pill-merck-molnupiravir-antiviral-fda">antiviral medications</a> that may soon be on the market require people to take them within three to five days of developing symptoms, so rapid tests may help people get treatment within that narrow window.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Logistics also may come into play in the decision. At-home tests aren’t officially recorded, unless a person reports the results to a doctor, and even then, the result may require confirmation with a second test. Insurance companies may require such confirmation to verify that people have had COVID-19 before paying for some treatments or for monitoring for long-term effects of the disease. International travelers will also probably need to get a PCR test for official verification that they are safe to fly, Gronvall says. “You could say that you’re negative, but without proof they’re not going to take your word for it.”</p>



<h4>How long are the tests good?</h4>



<p>If stored properly, the tests should be good for a while. For instance, the Abbott BinaxNOW test I just bought says to store it between 35.6° to 86° Fahrenheit (2° to 30° Celsius). It was manufactured on November 2, and the little hourglass symbol on the box tells me it is best if used before June 19, 2022.</p>



<p>That long shelf life may prove important as we learn to live with the coronavirus. Testing could become a routine part of our lives, as people seek additional ways to socialize, work and travel safely. And my friend certainly won’t be the last parent to have to swab their little ones’ noses looking for answers either.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/mrna-vaccine-next-viruses-flu-hiv-zika">These are the viruses that mRNA vaccines may take on next</a></h4>

              
                <p>Tiny molecules came up big in 2021. By year’s end, COVID-19 vaccines based on snippets of mRNA, or messenger RNA, proved to be safe and incredibly effective at preventing the worst outcomes of the disease.</p>



<p>mRNA vaccines tell our cells how to make a mimic of a viral protein, in this case <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/covid-delta-variant-mutations-coronavirus-life-cycle-2021">the spike protein that the coronavirus uses</a> to break into cells (<em>SN Online: 12/16/21</em>). The vaccine-generated protein then teaches the immune system what the real threat looks like should it later encounter that threat.</p>



<p>For decades, efforts to develop mRNA-based vaccines to <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/covid-coronavirus-vaccine-development-speed">fight infectious diseases like rabies</a> have been on a slow and meandering road (<em>SN Online: 6/29/21</em>). But the urgency of the pandemic breathed new life into these attempts. The promise of mRNA technology now takes us well past this pandemic’s horizon. “We’re right at the beginning of a really exciting time,” says Anna Blakney, a bioengineer who studies RNA technology at the University of British Columbia in Vancouver.</p>



<p>The dreams are big: Fighting all sorts of infections. Attacking cancer cells. Restoring specific proteins to treat genetic diseases, such as cystic fibrosis.</p>





<p>“It’s a really amazing technology that’s been proven over the past year,” Blakney says. But it won’t be a panacea, she cautions. “It works really well for some things. It’s unknown how well it will work for other things.”</p>



<p>Those answers might come soon. Here’s a look at four research efforts that have been aided by the swift momentum for mRNA vaccines that COVID-19 generated.</p>



<h4>Influenza </h4>



<p>Our current flu vaccines aren’t so hot. In a given year, flu shots are between 40 percent and 60 percent effective at preventing the disease. mRNA might do better. Pfizer has begun enrolling about 600 people ages 65 to 85 to find out how mRNA vaccines stack up against traditional flu shots. Moderna has already dosed participants in its own trial of such a flu vaccine, slated to include 180 adults in the United States.</p>



<h4>HIV  </h4>



<p>HIV is a <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/aids-hiv-vaccine-anniversary-immunity-antibodies">slippery foe</a>, able to evade the immune system by quickly mutating and disguising itself in a coat of human proteins and sugars (<em>SN: 7/3/21 &amp; 7/17/21, p. 14</em>). But mRNA vaccines may be able to train the body’s immune system to detect HIV in its many permutations. That’s the premise of a new clinical trial in the works, sponsored by the International AIDS Vaccine Initiative and including scientists from Moderna.</p>



<h4>Zika virus  </h4>



<p>There are no vaccines available to protect people against Zika virus, which <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/zika-may-harm-14-percent-babies-exposed-virus-womb">can cause severe disabilities in children born to infected mothers</a> (<em>SN Online: 8/7/18</em>). Scientists from Moderna are currently recruiting 800 adults for a clinical trial testing an mRNA vaccine for its safety and ability to prevent Zika infection.</p>



<h4>CMV (cytomegalovirus) </h4>



<p>CMV is a common and usually harmless virus. But it can be dangerous for newborn babies who get CMV from an infected mother before they are born. An early infection can lead to premature birth, hearing loss, seizures and developmental delays. Moderna has begun testing a CMV vaccine candidate — a combination of six different mRNAs that carry instructions for proteins on the surface of CMV. The clinical trial will include nearly 7,000 people. </p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/covid-johnson-vaccine-cdc-advisory-panel-mrna">The CDC recommends mRNA COVID-19 vaccines over J&J’s, citing fewer risks</a></h4>

              
                <p>People seeking a COVID-19 vaccine should choose an mRNA shot over Johnson &amp; Johnson’s, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends.</p>



<p>The mRNA vaccines, made by Moderna and by Pfizer and its German partner BioNtech, are safer and more effective and are the preferred option, an advisory panel unanimously agreed on December 16. Shortly thereafter, the CDC <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/media/releases/2021/s1216-covid-19-vaccines.html">signed off on the recommendation</a>, which is similar to policies in other countries. </p>



<p></p>



<p>But people who have allergies to ingredients in the mRNA vaccines and those who want the single-dose vaccine can still opt to get J&amp;J’s vaccine. The benefits of that shot, authorized for those 18 and older, still outweigh the risks. And as a single-shot vaccine, it&#8217;s been a crucial tool for getting vaccines to people who are incarcerated or transitory, such as the homeless.&nbsp;</p>





<p>The recommendation followed new data indicating that a blood-clotting side effect of J&amp;J’s shot, while rare, affects more than just young women. Of the 14.1 million people in the United States who got the J&amp;J jab from March 2 through August 31, 54 developed a <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/johnson-janssen-covid-coronavirus-vaccine-resume-pause-rare-blood-clot">blood-clotting condition known as thrombosis with thrombocytopenia</a>, or TTS (<em>SN: 4/23/21</em>).  <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/acip/meetings/downloads/slides-2021-12-16/02-COVID-See-508.pdf">Nine have died</a>, including one person vaccinated after August 31. Blood clots following the vaccine are suspected in two other deaths as well.</p>



<p>The blood clotting problem is most common in women 30 to 49 years old, with about 10 cases and 2 deaths per million doses given. But men ages 40 to 49, and women 18 to 29 and 50 to 64 also develop about 4 to 5 cases for every million doses of the vaccine. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration had previously changed its guidance to say that anyone with a prior history of this kind of blood clot should not get the J&amp;J shot.</p>



<p>In addition, a neurological side effect called Guillain-Barré syndrome is more common with the J&amp;J vaccine than with mRNA vaccines. J&amp;J’s single-shot vaccine is also <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/covid-coronavirus-booster-shots-vaccines-moderna-johnson-fda-cdc">less effective than the mRNA vaccines</a> (<em>SN: 10/19/21</em>).</p>



<p>Taken together, the <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/acip/meetings/downloads/slides-2021-12-16/04_COVID_Oliver_2021-12-16.pdf">risks and benefits of the mRNA vaccines</a> outweigh those of the J&amp;J jab. For instance, for every million women 18 to 49 years old vaccinated with the J&amp;J shot, 3,729 hospitalizations from COVID19 would be prevented. But nine cases of TTS and five cases of Guillain-Barré syndrome would be expected. The mRNA vaccines in women in that age group would avert 4,700 hospitalizations and produce two cases of <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/covid-coronavirus-vaccines-review-pandemic-2021">myocarditis</a>, a usually mild inflammation of the heart muscle (<em>SN: 12/15/21</em>).</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/robot-invasive-mosquito-fish">A terrifying robot can thwart invasive mosquito fish</a></h4>

              
                <p>Invasive mosquito fish are often fearless.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Free from the predators of their native range, these mosquito fish run rampant, throwing naive ecosystems from Europe to Australia out of whack. To keep the problematic fish in check, scientists are trying to strike fear back into the hearts of these swimmers with a high-tech tool: robots.</p>



<p>In a laboratory experiment, a robotic fish designed to mimic one of mosquito fish’s natural predators <a href="https://www.cell.com/iscience/fulltext/S2589-0042(21)01500-5">increased fear and stress responses</a> in mosquito fish, impairing their survival and reproduction, researchers report December 16 in <em>iScience</em>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>While robofish won&#8217;t be deployed in the wild anytime soon, the research highlights that there are “more creative ways of preventing unwanted behavior from a species” than simply killing them, says Michael Culshaw-Maurer, an ecologist at the University of Arizona in Tucson who wasn’t involved in the study. “It’s just wonderful seeing work in this area.”</p>





<p>Native to parts of the western and southeastern United States, mosquito fish (<em>Gambusia </em>spp.) were let loose in freshwater ecosystems around the globe last century in a foolhardy effort to control malaria. But instead of eating malaria-transmitting mosquito larvae, the mosquito fish mostly gobble up the eggs and gnaw at the tails of native fish and amphibians, making them one of the <a href="http://www.iucngisd.org/gisd/100_worst.php">world’s most destructive invasive species</a>, according to the International Union for Conservation of Nature.</p>



<p>Efforts to combat mosquito fish, and many other introduced, invasive species, usually rely on mass killing with traps, poison or other blunt methods, says Giovanni Polverino, a behavioral ecologist at the University of Western Australia in Perth. “For most of the invasive species considered problematic, this doesn’t work,” he says, and can often harm native species too.</p>



<p>The problem isn’t necessarily the presence of mosquito fish in these ecosystems, Polverino says, but their wanton behavior enabled by a lack of predators. While predation prevents prey numbers from ballooning, merely the <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/ecologists-restore-war-wrecked-ecosystem-mozambique">fear of predators</a> can influence prey behavior in ways that ripple throughout an ecosystem (<em>SN: 5/5/19</em>). Polverino and his colleagues wanted to see if a robotic fish crafted to mimic one of mosquito fish’s natural nemeses, the largemouth bass (<em>Micropterus salmoides</em>), could be just as scary and take some of the bite out of mosquito fish’s negative impact.</p>



<p>In the lab, researchers set up 12 tanks that each housed six mosquito fish (<em>G. holbrooki</em>) with six native Australian tadpoles (<em>Litoria moorei</em>) that are commonly harassed by mosquito fish. After a week of acclimatization, the team transferred each group to an experimental tank for one hour twice a week for five weeks. There, half of the groups faced a robotic predator designed to recognize and lunge at mosquito fish when they got too close to the tadpoles.</p>



<p>Fear of the robot altered the behavior, shape and fertility of the mosquito fish, both during exposure and weeks later. Mosquito fish facing the robot tended to cluster together and not explore the tank, while the tadpoles, free of harassment, ventured farther out.&nbsp;Even in the safety of their home aquariums, fish exposed to the robots were less active and more anxious — exhibited by seconds-longer freeze responses — than mosquito fish that weren’t exposed.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The cumulative stress taxed the fishes’ bodies too. Exposed fish lost energy reserves, becoming slightly smaller than nonexposed fish. Exposed males became more streamlined, potentially to quicken escape behaviors, the researchers say. And the sperm count of scared fish decreased by about half, on average.</p>



<p>“Instead of investing in reproduction, they’re investing in reshaping their body to escape better after only six weeks,” Polverino says. “Overall, they became less healthy and less fertile.”</p>



<p>The long-term impact that such robotic predators would have on wild mosquito fish and their neighbors remains unclear. That’s beside the point for Polverino, who says the main contribution of this study is showing that fear has significant consequences that may reduce the survival and reproduction of invasive species.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Our plan is not to release hundreds of thousands of these robots in the wild and pretend they will solve the problem,” Polverino says. But there may be more than one way to scare a mosquito fish. Giving the fish a whiff of their predator, for example, might induce similar changes.</p>



<p>“These are not invincible animals,” he says. “They have weaknesses that we can take advantage of that don’t involve killing animals one by one.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coronvirus-covid-airborne-public-health-agencies">Why it matters that health agencies finally said the coronavirus is airborne</a></h4>

              
                <p>This year, health experts around the world revised their views about how the coronavirus spreads. Aerosol scientists, virologists and other researchers had determined in 2020 that the virus spreads through the air, but it took until 2021 for prominent public health agencies to acknowledge the fact. The admission could have wide-ranging consequences for everything from public health recommendations and building codes to <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coronavirus-covid-music-wind-instruments-spread-transmission">marching band practices</a> (<em>SN: 8/14/21, p. 24</em>).</p>



<p>For decades, doctors and many researchers have thought that respiratory viruses such as cold and flu viruses spread mainly by people touching surfaces contaminated by mucus droplets and then touching their faces. That’s why, in the early days of the pandemic, disinfectant wipes flew off store shelves.</p>



<p>Surface-to-face transfer is still a probable route of infection for some cold-causing viruses, such as respiratory syncytial virus, or RSV. But it turns out that the coronavirus spreads mainly through fine aerosol particles that may hang in the air for hours, particularly indoors.</p>



<p>People spread such aerosols when coughing or sneezing, but also when talking, singing, shouting and even quietly breathing, allowing infected people to spread the disease even before they know they’re sick. Some evidence suggests that the coronavirus <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/covid-coronavirus-aerosol-droplets-airborne-evolution">may be evolving to spread more easily through the air</a> (<em>SN: 9/25/21, p. 6</em>).</p>





<p>It took collecting reams of data and more than 200 scientists pushing the World Health Organization and other public health agencies to acknowledge airborne spread of the coronavirus. In April 2021, both the WHO and U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention updated their recommendations to note that <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coronavirus-covid-air-spread-indoor-clean-ventilation-filtration">airborne spread is a major route</a> of infection (<em>SN Online: 5/18/21</em>).</p>



<p>That recognition was vital to public understanding of why <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/double-mask-fit-reduce-coronavirus-exposure-covid-19-pandemic">wearing well-fitting masks</a> is necessary <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/cdc-covid-coronavirus-masks-indoors-vaccinated-people-pandemic">in public indoor places</a> (<em>SN: 3/13/21, p. 14</em>; <em>SN Online: 7/27/21</em>). Masking, social distancing and other measures to guard against the coronavirus are also credited with <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/covid-19-coronavirus-precautions-flu-respiratory-infections-cases">nearly wiping out flu</a> last winter (<em>SN Online: 2/2/21</em>). Experts <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/covid-colds-common-respiratory-diseases-kids-return-school">fear a resurgence of cold and fl</a>u this winter if those measures aren’t continued (<em>SN Online: 8/12/21</em>).</p>



<p>Knowledge that COVID-19 is an airborne disease has led to such measures as <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coronavirus-covid-musicians-relocating-reduce-risk-concerts">rearranging seating in orchestras</a> (<em>SN Online: 6/23/21</em>) and updating recommendations for proper ventilation and filtration in buildings. Some scientists and activists have also suggested that the safety of indoor air should be regulated to reduce the spread of diseases, much like safety standards for food and drinking water.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/tornado-climate-warming-winter-stronger">How a warming climate may make winter tornadoes stronger</a></h4>

              
                <p><strong>NEW ORLEANS</strong> — Warmer winters could make twisters more powerful.</p>



<p>Though tornadoes can occur in any season, the United States logs the greatest number of powerful twisters in the warmer months from March to July. Devastating winter tornadoes like the one that <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2021/12/14/us/tornado-damage-victims">killed at least 88 people</a> across Kentucky and four other states beginning on December 10 are less common.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But climate change could increase tornado intensity in cooler months by many orders of magnitude beyond what was previously expected, researchers report December 13 in a poster at the American Geophysical Union’s fall meeting.</p>



<p>Tornadoes typically form during thunderstorms when warm, humid airstreams get trapped beneath cooler, drier winds. As the fast-moving air currents move past each other, they create rotating vortices that can <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/new-research-may-upend-what-we-know-about-how-tornadoes-form">transform into vertical, spinning twisters</a> (<em>SN: 12/14/18</em>). Many tornadoes are short-lived, sometimes lasting mere minutes and with a width of only 100 yards, says Jeff Trapp, an atmospheric scientist at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.</p>





<p>Over the last 20 years, tornado patterns have shifted so that these severe weather events occur later in the season and <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/more-tornadoes-are-popping-east-mississippi">across a broader range in the United States</a> than before, Trapp says (<em>SN: 10/18/18</em>). But scientists have struggled to pin down a direct link between the twister changes and human-caused climate change.</p>



<p>Unlike hurricanes and other severe storm systems, tornadoes happen at such a small scale that most global climate simulations don’t include the storms, says Kevin Reed, an atmospheric scientist at Stony Brook University in New York who was not involved in the new research.</p>



<p>To see how climate change may affect tornadoes, Trapp and colleagues started with atmospheric measurements of two historical tornadoes and simulated how those storm systems might play out in a warmer future.</p>



<p>The first historical tornado took place in the cool season on February 10, 2013, near Hattiesburg, Miss., and the second occurred in the warm season on May 20, 2013, in Moore, Okla. The researchers used a global warming simulation to predict how the twisters’ wind speeds, width and intensity could change in a series of alternative climate scenarios.</p>



<p>Both twisters would likely become more intense in futures affected by climate change, the team found. But the simulated winter storm was more than eightfold as powerful as its historical counterpart, in part due to a predicted 15 percent increase in wind speeds. Climate change is expected to increase the availability of warm, humid air systems during cooler months, providing an important ingredient for violent tempests.</p>



<p>“This is exactly what we saw on Friday night,” Trapp says. The unseasonably warm weather in the Midwest on the evening of December 10 and in the early morning of December 11 probably contributed to the devastation of the tornado that traveled hundreds of miles from Arkansas to Kentucky, he speculates.</p>



<p>Simulating how historical tornados could intensify in future climate scenarios is a “clever way” to address the knowledge gap around the effects of climate change on these severe weather systems, says Daniel Chavas, an atmospheric scientist at Purdue University in West Lafayette, Ind., who was not involved in the new research.</p>



<p>But Chavas notes that this research is only one piece of a larger puzzle as researchers investigate how tornados might impact communities in the future.</p>



<p>One drawback of this type of simulation is it often requires direct measurements from a historical event, Reed says. That limits its prediction power to re-creating documented tornadoes rather than broadly forecasting shifts in large-scale weather systems.</p>



<p>Though the team based its predictions on only two previous tornados, Trapp says he hopes that adding more historical twisters to the analysis could provide more data for policy makers as well as residents of communities that may have to bear the force of intensifying tornadoes.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/covid-delta-variant-mutations-coronavirus-life-cycle-2021">Why the coronavirus’s delta variant dominated 2021</a></h4>

              
                <p>2021 was a year of coronavirus variants.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Alpha and beta kicked off the year, and several worrisome variants later, omicron is closing it out. How omicron may come to define the pandemic’s future remains uncertain. But even as omicron comes on strong, one variant, which rose to global dominance midyear in a way variants like alpha and beta never did, continues to largely define the pandemic right now: delta.</p>



<p>Things had actually seemed to be looking up in some parts of the world in the late spring and early summer of 2021, a year and a half into the COVID-19 pandemic. In the United States, for instance, millions of people were vaccinated, cases of the disease were falling, and people were beginning to socialize and resume normal activities.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But then delta hit hard. First spotted in India in October 2020, this variant of SARS-CoV-2, the coronavirus that causes COVID-19, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coronavirus-covid-delta-variant-transmission-vaccines">quickly swept around the world</a>, supplanting other versions of the virus in 2021 (<em>SN:</em> <em>7/2/21</em>). Delta overwhelmed health care systems, tore through unvaccinated populations and showed that even the vaccinated were vulnerable, causing some breakthrough cases.&nbsp;</p>

<p>It soon became clear why delta wreaks so much havoc. People infected with delta <a href="https://academic.oup.com/cid/advance-article/doi/10.1093/cid/ciab721/6356459">make more of the virus and spread it for longer</a> than people infected with other variants, researchers reported in <em>Clinical Infectious Diseases</em> in August.&nbsp;As a result, delta infections are more contagious. Consider two scenarios in a community where no one has immunity to the coronavirus: A person infected with an earlier version of the virus — the one first identified in Wuhan, China, that set off the pandemic — might spread it to two or three others. But a person infected with delta may transmit it to five or six people.</p>



<p>Delta owes its success to mutations in some of its proteins. Take, for instance, a mutation called R203M in the coronavirus’s nucleocapsid, or N protein, located inside the virus. This mutation may <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.abl6184">increase the amount of viral RNA that can be made</a> or make it easier for the N protein to do its job, packing RNA into newly assembled viral particles, researchers reported in <em>Science</em> in November.&nbsp;</p>





<p>Mutations similar to delta’s have appeared here and there in other variants that proved themselves capable of spreading more easily or better evading the body’s immune defenses than the original virus. That includes alpha, first spotted in the United Kingdom; beta, first characterized in South Africa; and gamma, first noted in Brazil. The <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/omicron-coronavirus-variant-vaccines-mutations">recently discovered omicron variant</a>, first described in South Africa and Botswana, also shares some of the same mutations (<em>SN: 12/1/21</em>).&nbsp;</p>



<p>Some of delta’s grab bag of mutations are identical to those found in other variants, while others change the same protein building block, or amino acid, in a different way or pop up in the same part of the virus. For instance, alpha and omicron also have the same mutation of the 203rd amino acid in the N protein, but it is a different amino acid change than seen in delta. And some mutations are entirely new to delta.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Delta&#8217;s defining mutations</h3>



<p>These mutations on the coronavirus’ spike protein are what define delta as delta. The spike protein helps the coronavirus attach to and enter human cells. The delta variant’s version carries a unique collection of mutations, marked by yellow dots in this 3-D rendering. Some of these mutations may help the virus more easily infect cells or hide from antibodies.</p>

<p>Scientists don’t yet know the effect that all those changes have on delta’s ability to replicate or spread to others. What’s more, delta continues to evolve, picking up additional changes over time. But studies have zeroed in on the unique constellation of mutations decorating the virus’ spike protein. It’s the knobby protein studding each coronavirus that helps the virus latch onto and invade human cells. What looks like an individual knob is in fact composed of three identical pieces that fit together, each carrying the same set of mutations.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Some of delta’s spike protein mutations may help the virus more easily break into cells, where it turns cell machinery into virus-making factories. Two of those, dubbed T478K and L452R, are advantageously located on the receptor-binding domain. This is the part of the spike protein that attaches to ACE2, a protein on the surface of host cells.</p>



<p>Other mutations show up in a region of the spike protein called the N-terminal domain, which is a known target of the immune system’s neutralizing antibodies. These mutations may help the virus evade those antibodies, which can stop the virus from infecting cells.</p>



<p>And yet two other mutations, P681R and D614G, may help prep newly made viruses to go out and conquer. Those mutations are nestled near the dividing line for two parts of the spike protein, S1 and S2. Those parts need to be split apart to allow the coronavirus to engage in the<a href="https://coronavirus-annotation-3.sci.utah.edu/"> gymnastics needed to help it fuse with the membrane</a> of its prospective human host cell.</p>

<p>Human cells actually aid in this process: Inside infected cells a human protein called furin nicks the spike protein between the S1 and S2 segments, opening the receptor-binding domain so it can better grab ACE2. The P681R and D614G mutations may make the spike protein easier for furin to cut. Once snipped, newly-made viruses are primed to infect other cells. </p>



<p>Taken together, these mutations help delta break into cells more quickly and perform several tasks better than other variants do. As a result, in 2021, delta was able to become the dominant variant in the world.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Here’s how specific delta spike protein mutations may aid in a cell take-over:</p>

<h4>1. Some mutations allow the spike protein to get a better grip on cells.&nbsp;&nbsp;</h4>



<p>The coronavirus begins its cellular break-in by latching onto a protein called ACE2 that studs the surface of many types of human cells. Three mutations may make delta grabbier than other variants.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>D614G</strong> interrupts some molecular interactions in the spike protein near a hinge that controls whether the receptor binding domain is in a closed position where it is protected from antibodies, or in an open position so that it can grab ACE2. With the D614G mutation, it’s more likely that one or more of ACE2-snagging portions of the protein will be open for action.</p>



<p><strong>L452R</strong> may strengthen the interaction between ACE2 and the spike protein, making the virus more likely to infect cells. The change switches the charge on a protein building block in a key part of the spike protein from neutral to positive. So, like a magnet attracted to metal, the mutation seems to make the spike protein bind more tightly to a part of ACE2 that has a negative charge.</p>



<p><strong>T478K</strong> is unique to the delta variant. It’s so far unclear what it does, but like L452R, it may also help strengthen the spike protein’s hold on ACE2.</p>

<h4>2. Some mutations allow delta to better fuse with the cell’s membrane, paving the way for the coronavirus to dump its genetic material into the cell.</h4>



<p>Once delta latches onto ACE2, a human protein called TMPRSS2 cuts away a part of the spike protein. As a result, the S1 portion of the protein is discarded, freeing up the S2 portion of the protein to twist into shape for the next step in the process: fusing to the cell. Some evidence suggests delta may be better at letting go of S1, making breaking into cells easier.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>L452R</strong> may help the virus fuse with the membrane on the outside of the cell it’s trying to infect. That allows the virus to release its genetic material and begin hijacking the cell’s machinery to begin making more copies of itself.</p>



<p><strong>P681R</strong> may create a stretch of basic amino acids that could help the virus fuse better with the cell membrane, helping more viruses get inside more cells.</p>



<p>As a result of these and other changes, delta can<a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.abl9463"> fuse with cells faster and can enter cells that have lower levels of ACE2</a> studding their surfaces than other variants can, researchers reported in <em>Science</em> in October.</p>



<p>After the virus fuses to the cell, it sets loose its RNA and turns its new lair into a virus factory: Viral RNA is copied, human ribosomes make viral proteins and the cell churns out nearly identical copies of the coronavirus. As the virus makes copies of its RNA, it can make typos. Sometimes, the genetic errors help the virus, which can give rise to variants like delta. But not all changes are good for the virus. Some genetic typos cause damage to viral proteins, meaning the viruses with those mutations can’t infect new cells. Other changes don’t have any effect on the virus at all.&nbsp;</p>

<h4>3. Some delta mutations may better prime newly made viruses to more easily infect cells.&nbsp;</h4>



<p>Before newly made viruses are released from the cell, the human protein furin snips the spike protein between S1 and S2. That lets the spike protein adopt the right shape to snag human cells and sets the protein up to allow for better membrane fusion.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Delta may be snippier than other variants.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Mutations <strong>D614G </strong>and<strong> P681R</strong> may increase the number of spike proteins cut by furin on each newly made virus, better prepping the viruses to enter other cells.</p>



<p><strong>D614G</strong> makes it easier for furin to make its snips. This preliminary cut happens in a different location than the TMPRSS2 cut. The mutation may also increase the number of spike proteins on each copy of the virus.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Like D614G, <strong>P681R</strong> may also boost the number of spike proteins cut by the human cell protein furin, priming the newly made viruses to infect new cells.&nbsp;</p>

<h4>4. Some mutations may help newly released viruses evade antibodies as the viruses seek out other cells to infect.</h4>



<p>The immune systems of people who have recovered from an infection or those who got vaccinated make antibodies to the coronavirus. Several of delta’s mutations may help the virus evade these antibodies, which would otherwise block viral entry into other cells.</p>



<p><strong>T19R</strong>, <strong>G142D</strong>, <strong>R158G</strong> and two spots — called <strong>E156del </strong>and <strong>F157del </strong>—<strong> </strong>where amino acids are missing from the protein may hide parts of the virus from antibodies, helping it slip past those immune system defenses.</p>



<p><strong>T478K</strong>, the mutation unique to the delta variant, is close to the same spot as E484K, a mutation that was implicated in the antibody-evasion tactics of the beta variant.</p>

                <p><em>By guest blogger </em>Dan Carney</p>



<p>A key development in autism research in the last twenty-odd years has been the use of less rigid methods such as interviews, fieldwork, and surveys, instead of those based on standardised measurements or other “laboratory-based” tasks. These looser approaches, in tandem with the increasing popularity of autobiographical writing by autistic people, have served to complement more traditional research by adding nuance and detail to understandings of the condition.</p>



<p>Now, a team from Australia led by Rozanna Lilley <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/13623613211050694">has used such an approach</a> with a population underrepresented in autism research, namely late-diagnosed adults. The authors conducted oral history interviews with 26 autistic adults born before 1975 — thus growing up before the condition was widely known — and diagnosed when over the age of 35. Lilley and colleagues were interested in how participants’ sense of their own identity has changed over time, and how receiving a diagnosis may have impacted this.</p>



<span id="more-44908"></span>



<p>The project involved the autistic community throughout. The research team included three late-diagnosed autistic adults, two of whom conducted the interviews. An autistic advisory group was also consulted at every stage. Interviews were semi-structured, meaning questions were prepared but adhered to loosely, to enable divergence and further exploration of anything arising. This allowed participants to tell their stories in their own way, and enhance their accounts with artefacts such as photographs or other personal objects.</p>



<p>Responses underwent <em>thematic analysis</em>, whereby content is inspected meticulously for any themes that repeatedly emerge. Four key themes relating to interviewees’ perception of self came out of this analysis. The first, “being different”, reflected the fact that participants felt a sense of difference from a young age. They reported both negative factors such as feeling marginalised or excluded, and more positive ones, such as heightened intelligence, curiosity, creativity, and sense of self-containment, or being in a “bubble”.</p>



<p>The second theme identified was “exploring identity”. Participants reported using role-playing to help them fit in; this is in keeping with studies which have shown that autistic people sometimes employ strategies involving “camouflaging” or “masking” the true self in order to conform to societal expectations. Some interviewees also highlighted the idea of self-reinvention as a way to escape these demands.</p>



<p>The third theme, “the suffering self”, concerned participants’ negative self-conceptions and feelings of turmoil. For some, there was a clear relationship between trauma, negative self-conceptions, and suffering. Reported traumatic events included severe bullying and childhood sexual abuse, with one participant describing how she blamed herself for the abuse she had endured. There is relatively little knowledge about how the impact of such events may be further complicated by being autistic, and this finding emphasises the need for more work in this area.</p>



<p>The final theme, “being Autistic”, centred around participants’ transformed sense of self following an autism diagnosis. This was overwhelmingly positive. Diagnosis provided an explanation for past challenges, enabled self-acceptance, and contributed to a greater sense of &#8220;self-authenticity&#8221;. That diagnosis was so key to participants’ sense of their own identity contradicts studies that suggest autistic people experience their autism as “separate” from, or at odds with, their “true” selves.</p>



<p>The authors also observe that participants’ level of self-awareness, and their ability to reflect on their changing self-identity over time, was impressive. This is at odds with the prevailing idea — frequently inferred from studies finding autistic people’s autobiographical accounts to be lacking — that autism involves a deficit in self-perception. This suggests that <em>how</em> studies collect autobiographical data from autistic people is important, with a looser approach enabling richer responses.</p>



<p>Although all interviewees had spent most of their lives in Australia, knowledge of autism in that country has developed roughly in parallel with the UK, with inclusion of the condition in the DSM-III in the 1980s prompting a diagnostic surge in both countries. However, one sample-related limitation — which the authors acknowledge — is that most participants were white, well educated, and middle class. Given the importance of context and experience in any study based on oral histories, it is debatable whether all findings would hold across different cultural and economic backgrounds. Secondly, the authors point out that research of this nature attracts individuals who identify positively with their diagnosis. Those who have a negative experience, or might not feel particularly affected, may thus be underrepresented. Future work should address these issues.</p>



<p>Nevertheless, this is a study that sheds light on both the changing perceptions of the self in autistic people and the positive aspects of an autism diagnosis. It also demonstrates that research that meets autistic people on their own terms, acknowledging that they have experience-based expertise and allowing them the freedom to construct detailed and nuanced accounts of these experiences, significantly adds to our understanding of the condition.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/parker-solar-probe-sun-atmosphere-first-spacecraft">The Parker Solar Probe is the first spacecraft to visit the sun’s atmosphere</a></h4>

              
                <p>For the first time, a spacecraft has made contact with the sun. During a recent flyby, NASA’s Parker Solar Probe entered the sun’s atmosphere.</p>



<p>“We have finally arrived,” Nicola Fox, director of NASA’s Heliophysics Science Division in Washington, D.C., said December 14 in a news briefing at the fall meeting of the American Geophysical Union. “Humanity has touched the sun.”</p>



<p>Parker left interplanetary space and crossed into solar territory on April 28, 2021, during one of its close encounters with the sun. While there, the probe took the first measurements of exactly where this boundary, called the Alfvén critical surface, lies. It was about <a href="https://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.127.255101">13 million kilometers above the sun’s surface</a>, physicists reported at the meeting, held online and in New Orleans, and in <em>Physical Review Letters</em> on December 14.</p>



<p>“We knew the Alfvén critical surface had to exist,” solar physicist Justin Kasper of the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor said at the news briefing. “We just didn’t know where it was.”</p>





<p>Finding this crucial layer was one of Parker’s main goals <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/nasa-parker-solar-probe-aiming-sun">when it launched in 2018</a> (<em>SN: 7/5/18</em>). The Alfvén critical surface is important because it marks where packets of plasma can separate from the sun and become part of the <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/2017-solar-eclipse-solar-wind">solar wind</a>, the speedy stream of charged particles that constantly emanates from the sun (<em>SN: 8/18/17</em>). The solar wind and other, more dramatic forms of space weather can <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/sun-solar-storms-earth-havoc-space-weather-forecasts">wreak havoc on Earth’s satellites</a> and even on life (<em>SN: 2/26/21</em>). Scientists want to pinpoint exactly how the wind gets started to better understand how it can impact Earth.</p>



<p>The Alfvén critical surface also may hold the key to one of the biggest solar mysteries: why the sun’s corona, its wispy outer atmosphere, is <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/2017-solar-eclipse-hot-corona">so much hotter than the sun’s surface</a> (<em>SN: 8/20/17</em>). With most heat sources, temperatures drop as you move farther away. But the sun’s corona sizzles at more than a million degrees Celsius, while the surface is only a few thousand degrees.<a></a></p>



<p>In 1942, physicist Hannes Alfvén proposed a solution to the mystery: A type of magnetic wave might carry energy from the solar surface and heat up the corona. It took until 2009 to <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/hotter-sun">directly observe such waves, in the lower corona</a>, but they didn’t carry enough energy there to explain all the heat (<em>SN: 3/19/09</em>). Solar physicists have suspected that what happens as those waves climb higher and meet the Alfvén critical surface might play a role in heating the corona. But until now, scientists didn’t know where this frontier began.</p>



<p>With the boundary identified, “we’ll now be able to witness directly how coronal heating happens,” Kasper said. &nbsp;</p>



<p>As Parker crossed the invisible boundary, its instruments recorded a marked increase in the strength of the local magnetic field and a drop in the density of charged material. Out in the solar wind, waves of charged particles gush away from the sun. But below the Alfvén critical surface, some of those waves bend back toward the surface of the sun.</p>

<p>Surprisingly, Parker’s measurements showed that the Alfvén critical surface is wrinkly. “That was one of the big outstanding questions,” says solar physicist Craig DeForest of the Southwest Research Institute in Boulder, Colo., who is a member of the Parker probe team but was not part of this measurement.</p>



<p>“There was some debate in the community about whether the Alfvén surface would exist as a surface at all,” he says. Decades ago, scientists imagined the boundary as a smooth sphere surrounding the sun like a snow globe. More recently, some thought it would be so ragged that it wouldn’t be apparent when the spacecraft crossed it.</p>



<p>Neither of those images turned out to be correct. The surface is smooth enough that the moment of crossing was noticeable, Kasper said. But during the spacecraft’s close approach to the sun in April, it crossed in and out of the boundary three times. The first dip lasted about five hours, the last only half an hour.</p>



<p>“The surface clearly has some structure and warp to it,” Kasper said.</p>



<p>That structure could influence everything from the way solar eruptions leave the sun to the way the solar wind interacts with itself farther out from the sun, DeForest says. “That has consequences that we don’t know yet, but are likely to be profound,” he says. “This is very exciting. It’s terra incognita.”</p>



<p>Parker is still orbiting the sun and planning to make several more close approaches over the next few years, eventually getting within 6 million kilometers of the solar surface. That should bring Parker into the solar corona again and again, solar physicist Nour Raouafi of the Johns Hopkins Applied Physics Laboratory in Laurel, Md., said in the news briefing. The spacecraft may have made another journey past the Alfvén critical surface in August and will have another opportunity in January.</p>



<p>“The expectation is that as we fly closer and closer to the sun, we’ll keep crossing this boundary,” Raouafi said. But the boundary might not be in the same place every time. As the sun’s activity changes, the level of the Alfvén critical surface is expected to rise and fall as if the corona is breathing in and out, he said.</p>



<p>That’s another thing that scientists hope to observe for the first time.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/neandertals-first-hominid-modify-environment-forest-grassland">Neandertals were the first hominids to turn forest into grassland 125,000 years ago</a></h4>

              
                <p>Neandertals took Stone Age landscaping to a previously unrecognized level.</p>



<p>Around 125,000 years ago, these close human relatives transformed a largely forested area bordering two central European lakes into a relatively open landscape, say archaeologist Wil Roebroeks of Leiden University in the Netherlands, and his colleagues. Analyses of pollen, charcoal, animal fossils and other material previously unearthed at two ancient lake basins in Germany provide the <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.abj5567">oldest known evidence of hominids reshaping their environments</a>, the scientists report December 15 in <em>Science Advances</em>.</p>



<p>The excavated areas are located within a site called Neumark-Nord. Neandertals’ daily activities there, apparently ongoing throughout the year, had a big environmental impact, the researchers suspect. Those pursuits, which occurred over a span of about 2,000 years, included setting campfires, butchering game, collecting wood, making tools and constructing shelters, they say.</p>



<p>“We might be dealing with larger and less mobile groups of [Neandertals] than commonly acknowledged,” Roebroeks says, thanks in part to warming temperatures after around 150,000 years ago that cleared ice sheets from resource-rich locations such as Neumark-Nord.</p>





<p>His team can’t say whether Neandertals set fires to clear large tracts of land at Neumark-Nord, a practice that has been observed among some modern hunter-gatherers. The geological remnants of many small campfires may look much like those of a small number of large fires, Roebroeks says.</p>



<p>Finds at Neumark-Nord play into an ongoing debate about when humans began to have a dominating influence on the natural world. Some scientists regard this period as a <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/humankinds-destructive-streak-may-be-older-species-itself">new geological epoch, the Anthropocene</a> (<em>SN: 4/1/13</em>). It’s unclear when the Anthropocene began and whether its roots extend back to the Stone Age.</p>



<p>Regular <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/ashes-oldest-controlled-fire">fire use by members of the <em>Homo</em> genus</a> began around 400,000 years ago (<em>SN: 4/2/12</em>). Evidence of human occupations associated with increased fire setting and shifts to open habitats date to around 40,000 years ago in Australia; 45,000 years ago in highland New Guinea; and 50,000 years ago in Borneo.</p>



<p>Analyses of lake cores and stone-tool sites in southern-central Africa indicate that fires set by increasing numbers of humans <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.abf9776">kept the landscape open</a> even as rainy conditions conducive to forest growth developed around 85,000 years ago. Open environments still predominate in this part of Africa, Yale University paleoanthropologist Jessica Thompson and her colleagues reported May 5 in <em>Science Advances</em>. “Humans and close human relatives like Neandertals have likely been [modifying] their ecosystems for a very long time,” Thompson says.</p>



<p>A large coal mining operation revealed ancient Neumark-Nord sediments in 1985. German scientists then excavated a large lakeside site, wrapping up that project in the mid-1990s. The same team excavated a smaller site at a lake basin located about 100 meters from the first site between 2004 and 2008.</p>



<p>Pollen from these sites indicates that grasses and herbs, hallmarks of an open landscape, appeared in a brief window of time around 125,000 years ago, Roebroeks and his colleagues say. Large numbers of stone artifacts — some showing signs of having been heated, possibly to make finished edges sharper — and animal bones displaying butchery marks date to the same time at Neumark-Nord, when Neandertals but not <em>Homo sapiens</em> inhabited Europe.</p>

<p>Stone tools and bone fragments displaying signs of heating, burned wood, charred seeds and dense patches of charcoal particles suggested that Neandertals had frequently set fires near the Neumark-Nord lakes.</p>



<p>Pollen from two other sites in the same mountainous part of Germany, where researchers previously found small numbers of stone tools suggesting a limited Neandertal presence, show that forests dominated there when Neandertals inhabited Neumark-Nord’s grasslands. That strengthens the view that Neandertals altered the Neumark-Nord landscape rather than settling there after forests had shrunk, Roebroeks says.</p>



<p>Archaeologist Manuel Will of Eberhard Karls University of Tübingen in Germany agrees. “Neandertal evidence from Neumark-Nord should be a wake-up call for the international scientific community to include archaeologists [studying] the Paleolithic record as part of any team trying to define and identify the beginning of the Anthropocene,” says Will, who did not participate in the new study.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/quantum-physics-imaginary-numbers-math-reality">Quantum physics requires imaginary numbers to explain reality</a></h4>

              
                <p>Imaginary numbers might seem like unicorns and goblins — interesting but irrelevant to reality.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But for describing matter at its roots, imaginary numbers turn out to be essential. They seem to be woven into the fabric of quantum mechanics, the math describing the realm of molecules, atoms and subatomic particles. A theory obeying the rules of quantum physics needs imaginary numbers to describe the real world, two new experiments suggest.</p>



<p>Imaginary numbers result from taking the square root of a negative number. They often pop up in equations as a mathematical tool to make calculations easier. But everything we can actually measure about the world is described by <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/real-numbers-physics-free-will">real numbers</a>, the normal, nonimaginary figures we’re used to (<em>SN: 5/8/18</em>). That’s true in quantum physics too. Although imaginary numbers appear in the inner workings of the theory, all possible measurements generate real numbers.</p>



<p>Quantum theory’s prominent use of complex numbers — sums of imaginary and real numbers — was disconcerting to its founders, including physicist Erwin Schrödinger. “From the early days of quantum theory, complex numbers were treated more as a mathematical convenience than a fundamental building block,” says physicist Jingyun Fan of the Southern University of Science and Technology in Shenzhen, China.</p>





<p>Some physicists have attempted to build quantum theory using real numbers only, avoiding the imaginary realm with versions called “real quantum mechanics.” But without an experimental test of such theories, the question remained whether imaginary numbers were truly necessary in quantum physics, or just a useful computational tool.</p>



<p>A type of experiment known as a Bell test resolved a different quantum quandary, proving that quantum mechanics really requires <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/new-experiment-verifies-quantum-spookiness">strange quantum linkages</a> between particles called entanglement (<em>SN: 8/28/15</em>). “We started thinking about whether an experiment of this sort could also refute real quantum mechanics,” says theoretical physicist Miguel Navascués of the Institute for Quantum Optics and Quantum Information Vienna. He and colleagues <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-021-04160-4">laid out a plan</a> for an experiment in a paper <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2101.10873">posted online</a> at arXiv.org in January 2021 and published December 15 in <em>Nature</em>.</p>



<p>In this plan, researchers would send pairs of entangled particles from two different sources to three different people, named according to conventional physics lingo as Alice, Bob and Charlie. Alice receives one particle, and can measure it using various settings that she chooses. Charlie does the same. Bob receives two particles and performs a special type of measurement to entangle the particles that Alice and Charlie receive. A real quantum theory, with no imaginary numbers, would predict different results than standard quantum physics, allowing the experiment to distinguish which one is correct.</p>



<p>Fan and colleagues performed such an experiment using photons, or particles of light, they report in a paper to be published in <em>Physical Review Letters</em>. By studying how Alice, Charlie and Bob’s results compare across many measurements, Fan, Navascués and colleagues show that the data could be described <a href="https://journals.aps.org/prl/accepted/0907bY08X531687d3971977071a6d5f742cb036ed">only by a quantum theory with complex numbers</a>.</p>



<p>Another team of physicists conducted an experiment based on the same concept using a quantum computer made with superconductors, materials which conduct electricity without resistance. Those researchers, too, found that <a href="https://journals.aps.org/prl/accepted/78079Y84Y081c97378657f0692b88fad215208b84">quantum physics requires complex numbers</a>, they report in another paper to be published in <em>Physical Review Letters</em>. “We are curious about why complex numbers are necessary and play a fundamental role in quantum mechanics,” says quantum physicist Chao-Yang Lu of the University of Science and Technology of China in Hefei, a coauthor of the study.</p>



<p>But the results don’t rule out all theories that eschew imaginary numbers, notes theoretical physicist Jerry Finkelstein of Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory in California, who was not involved with the new studies. The study eliminated certain theories based on real numbers, namely those that still follow the conventions of quantum mechanics. It’s still possible to explain the results without imaginary numbers by using a theory that breaks standard quantum rules. But those theories run into other conceptual issues, making them “ugly,” he says. But “if you’re willing to put up with the ugliness, then you can have a real quantum theory.”</p>



<p>Despite the caveat, other physicists agree that the quandaries raised by the new findings are compelling. “I find it intriguing when you ask questions about why is quantum mechanics the way it is,” says physicist Krister Shalm of the National Institute of Standards and Technology in Boulder, Colo. Asking whether quantum theory could be simpler or if it contains anything unnecessary, “these are very interesting and thought-provoking questions.”</p>

                "After the publication shut down, owner Stephen Mindich wanted the public to be able to access back issues of the Phoenix. The complete run of the newspaper from 1973 to 2013 was donated to Northeastern University’s special collections. The family signed copyright over the university. 

Librarians led a crowdsourcing project to create a digital index of all the articles and authors, which was helpful for historians and others in their research, said Giordana Mecagni, head of special collections and university archivist. Northeastern had inquired about digitizing the collection, but it was cost prohibitive. 

As it turns out, the Internet Archive owned the master microfilm for the Phoenix and it put the full collection online in a separate collection: The Boston Phoenix 1973-2013. Initially, the back issues were only available for one patron to check out at a time through Controlled Digital Lending. Once Northeastern learned about the digitized collection, it extended rights to the Archive to allow the Phoenix to be downloaded without controls...."

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/covid-coronavirus-vaccines-review-pandemic-2021">In 2021, COVID-19 vaccines were put to the test. Here’s what we learned</a></h4>

              
                <p class="has-medium-font-size">2021 was the year the COVID-19 vaccines had to prove their mettle. We started the year full of hope: With vaccines in hand in record-breaking time and their rollout ramping up, we’d get shots in arms, curb this pandemic and get life back to normal. That was too optimistic.</p>



<p>Roughly 200 million people in the United States — and billions globally — have now been fully vaccinated. Three vaccines — one from Pfizer and its partner BioNTech, and the other two from Moderna and Johnson &amp; Johnson — are available in the United States. Pfizer’s is even available for children as young as 5. About two dozen other vaccines have also been deployed in other parts of the world. In some higher-income countries, the United States included, people have already queued up for booster shots.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But 2021 has also been the year of learning the limits of the vaccines’ superpowers. With the vaccines pitted against aggressive coronavirus variants, inequitable distribution, some people’s hesitancy and the natural course of waning effectiveness, there’s still a lot of work to do to bring this pandemic to an end. As if to hammer home that point, the detection of the omicron variant in late November brought new uncertainty to the pandemic’s trajectory. Here are some of the top lessons we’ve learned in the first year of the COVID-19 vaccine. — <em>Macon Morehouse</em></p>







<h3>The shots work, even against emerging variants</h3>



<p>Many COVID-19 vaccines proved effective over the last year, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/covid-coronavirus-vaccines-hospital-cases-rates-unvaccinated">particularly at preventing severe disease and death</a> (<em>SN: 10/9/21 &amp; 10/23/21, p. 4</em>). That’s true even with the emergence of more transmissible coronavirus variants.</p>



<p>In January, in the midst of a bleak winter surge that saw average daily cases in the United States peaking at nearly 250,000, the vaccination rollout here began in earnest. Soon after, case numbers began a steep decline.</p>



<p>Over the summer, though, more reports of coronavirus infections in vaccinated people began to pop up. <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/covid-coronavirus-who-gets-booster-shots-vaccines-pfizer-fda">Protection against infection becomes less robust</a> in the months following vaccination in people who received Pfizer’s or Moderna’s mRNA vaccines, multiple studies have shown (<em>SN Online: 9/21/21</em>). Yet the shots’ original target — preventing hospitalization — has held steady, with an efficacy of about 80 percent to 95 percent.</p>

<h4>

</h4>
</aside>



<p>A single dose of Johnson &amp; Johnson’s vaccine is less effective at preventing symptoms or keeping people out of the hospital than the mRNA jabs. The company claims there’s <a href="https://www.jnj.com/johnson-johnson-announces-real-world-evidence-and-phase-3-data-confirming-strong-and-long-lasting-protection-of-single-shot-covid-19-vaccine-in-the-u-s">not yet evidence that the protection wanes</a>. But even if that protection is not waning, some real-world data hint that the <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/covid-coronavirus-booster-shots-vaccines-moderna-johnson-fda-cdc">shot may not be as effective as clinical trials suggested</a> (<em>SN Online: 10/19/21</em>).</p>



<p>Evidence of waning or lower protection ultimately pushed the United States and some other countries to green-light <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coronavirus-covid-vaccine-booster-shot-choose">COVID-19 booster shots</a> for adults (<em>SN: 12/4/21, p. 6</em>).</p>



<p>Much of the worry over waning immunity came amid the spread of highly contagious variants, including alpha, first identified in the United Kingdom in September 2020, and <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/delta-variant-studies-cdc-coronavirus-covid-pandemic">delta</a>, first detected in India in October 2020 (<em>SN Online: 7/30/21</em>). Today, delta is the predominant variant globally.</p>



<p>The good news is that vaccinated people aren’t unarmed against these mutated foes. The immune system launches a multipronged attack against invaders, so the response can handle small molecular tweaks to viruses, says Nina Luning Prak, an immunologist at the University of Pennsylvania. Dealing with variants “is what the immune system does.”</p>

<p>Vaccine-prompted antibodies still attack alpha and delta, though slightly less well than they tackle the original virus that emerged in Wuhan, China, two years ago. Antibodies also still recognize more immune-evasive variants such as beta, first identified in South Africa in May 2020, and gamma, identified in Brazil in November 2020. Although protection against infection dips against many of these variants, vaccinated people remain much less likely to be hospitalized compared with unvaccinated people.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-pullquote alignright"><blockquote><p>&#8220;This is the first time in history that we&#8217;re basically monitoring virus mutations in real time.&#8221;</p><cite> Müge Çevik, infectious diseases physician</cite></blockquote></figure>



<p>Experts will continue to track how well the vaccines are doing, especially as new variants, like omicron, emerge. In late November, the World Health Organization designated the omicron variant as the latest variant of concern after researchers in South Africa and Botswana warned that it carries several worrisome mutations. Preliminary studies suggest that, so far, omicron is spreading fast in places including South Africa and the United Kingdom, and can reinfect people who have already recovered from an infection. The variant <a href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/1040064/9_December-2021-risk-assessment-for-SARS_Omicron_VOC-21NOV-01_B.1.1.529.pdf">might be at least as transmissible as delta</a>, though that&#8217;s still far from certain, according to a December 9 report from researchers with Public Health England, a U.K. health agency. How omicron may affect vaccine effectiveness is also unclear. Pfizer&#8217;s two-dose shot, for instance, may be about 30 percent effective at preventing symptoms from omicron infections while a booster could bring effectiveness back up to more than 70 percent, according to estimates from Public Health England. But those estimates are based on low case numbers and could change as omicron spreads. </p>



<p>“This is the first time in history that we’re basically monitoring virus mutations in real time,” says Müge Çevik, an infectious diseases physician and virologist at the University of St. Andrews in Scotland. “This is what the viruses do. It’s just that we’re seeing it because we’re looking for it.”</p>



<p>But it’s unlikely that any new variant will take us back to square one, Çevik says. Because of the immune system’s varied defenses, it will be difficult for a coronavirus variant to become completely resistant to vaccine-induced protection. The vaccines are giving our immune systems the tools to fight back. — <em>Erin Garcia de Jesús</em></p>



<h3>The shots are safe, with few serious side effects</h3>



<p>With billions of doses distributed around the world, the shots have proved not only effective, but also remarkably safe, with few serious side effects.</p>



<p>“We have so much safety data on these vaccines,” says Kawsar Talaat, an infectious diseases physician at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health. “I don’t know of any vaccines that have been scrutinized to the same extent.”</p>



<p>Commonly reported side effects include pain, redness or swelling at the spot of the shot, muscle aches, fatigue, fever, chills or a headache. These symptoms usually last only a day or two.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-pullquote alignright"><blockquote><p>&#8220;We have so much safety data on these vaccines. I don&#8217;t know of any vaccines that have been scrutinized to the same extent.&#8221;</p><cite> Kawsar Talaat, infectious diseases physician </cite></blockquote></figure>



<p>More rare and serious side effects have been noted. But none are unique to these shots; other vaccines — plus infectious diseases, including COVID-19 — also cause these complications.</p>



<p>One example is inflammation of the heart muscle, known as myocarditis, or of the sac around the heart, pericarditis. <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/covid-coronavirus-booster-shots-vaccines-moderna-johnson-fda-cdc">Current estimates are a bit squishy</a> since existing studies have different populations and other variables (<em>SN Online: 10/19/21</em>). Two <a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2110737">large studies in Israel</a> estimated that the risk of myocarditis after an mRNA vaccine is about <a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2109730">4 of every 100,000 males</a> and 0.23 to 0.46 of every 100,000 females, researchers reported in October in the <em>New England Journal of Medicine</em>. Yet members of Kaiser Permanente Southern California who had gotten mRNA vaccines developed myocarditis at a much lower rate: <a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/fullarticle/2784800">5.8 cases for every 1 million second doses</a> given, researchers reported, also in October, in <em>JAMA Internal Medicin</em>e.</p>



<p>What all the studies have in common is that young males in their teens and 20s are <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/covid-coronavirus-mrna-vaccines-heart-inflammation-myocarditis">at highest risk of developing the side effect</a>, and that risk is highest after the second vaccine dose (<em>SN Online: 6/23/21</em>). But it’s still fairly rare, topping out at about 15 cases for every 100,000 vaccinated males ages 16 to 19, according to the larger of the two Israeli studies. Males in that age group are also at the highest risk of getting myocarditis and pericarditis from any cause, including from COVID-19.</p>

<p>Components of the mRNA vaccines may also cause allergic reactions, including potentially life-threatening anaphylaxis. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention calculated that anaphylaxis happens at a rate of about 0.025 to 0.047 cases for every 10,000 vaccine doses given.</p>



<p>But a study of almost 65,000 health care system employees in Massachusetts suggests the <a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2777417">rate may be as high as 2.47 per 10,000 vaccinations</a>, researchers reported in March in <em>JAMA</em>. Still, that rate is low, and people with previous histories of anaphylaxis have gotten the shots without problem. Even people who developed anaphylaxis after a first shot were able to get fully vaccinated if the <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/covid-vaccine-side-effects-coronavirus-myocarditis">second dose was broken down into smaller doses</a> (<em>SN Online: 6/1/21</em>).</p>



<p>The only side effect of the COVID-19 vaccines not seen with other vaccines is a rare combination of blood clots accompanied by low numbers of blood-clotting platelets.

<p>About <a href="https://www.fda.gov/media/152954/download">5 to 6 TTS cases were reported for every 1 million doses</a> of the J&amp;J vaccine, the company reported to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. The clots may result from antibodies <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/covid-vaccine-blood-clot-immune-astrazeneca-johnson-johnson">triggering a person’s platelets to form clots</a> (<em>SN Online: 4/16/21</em>). Such antibodies also cause blood clots in COVID-19 patients, and the risk of developing strokes or clots from the disease is much higher than with the vaccine, Talaat says. In one study, <a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/eclinm/article/PIIS2589-5370(21)00341-2/fulltext">42.8 of every 1 million COVID-19 patients</a> developed one type of blood clot in the brain, and 392.3 per 1 million developed a type of abdominal blood clot, researchers reported in <em>EClinicalMedicine</em> in September.</p>



<p>“Your chances of getting any of these side effects, except for the sore arm, from an illness with COVID are much higher” than from the vaccines, Talaat says. — <em>Tina Hesman Saey</em></p>



<h3>Getting everyone vaccinated is … complicated</h3>



<p>The quest to vaccinate as many people as quickly as possible this year faced two main challenges: getting the vaccine to people and convincing them to take it. Strategies employed so far — incentives, mandates and making shots accessible — have had varying levels of success.</p>



<p>“It’s an incredibly ambitious goal to try to get the large majority of the country and the globe vaccinated in a very short time period with a brand-new vaccine,” says psychologist Gretchen Chapman of Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh, who researches vaccine acceptance. Usually “it takes a number of years before you get that kind of coverage.”</p>



<figure class="wp-block-pullquote alignright"><blockquote><p>&#8220;It&#8217;s an incredibly ambitious goal to try to get the large majority of the country and the globe vaccinated in a very short time period with a brand-new vaccine.&#8221;</p><cite>Gretchen Chapman, psychologist</cite></blockquote></figure>



<p>Globally, that’s sure to be the case due to a lack of access to vaccines, particularly in middle- and lower-income countries. The World Health Organization set a goal to have 40 percent of people in all countries vaccinated by year’s end. But dozens of countries, mostly in Africa and parts of Asia, are likely to fall far short of that goal.</p>



<p>In contrast, the United States and other wealthy countries got their hands on more than enough doses. Here, the push to vaccinate started out with a scramble to reserve scarce appointments for a free shot at limited vaccination sites. But by late spring, eligible people could pop into their pharmacy or grocery store. Some workplaces offered vaccines on-site. For underserved communities that may have a harder time accessing such vaccines, more targeted approaches <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coronavirus-covid-vaccine-outreach-hispanic-communities-philadelphia">where shots are delivered by trusted sources at community events</a> proved they could boost vaccination numbers (<em>SN Online: 6/18/21</em>).&nbsp;</p>



<p>Simply making the shot easy to get has driven much of the progress made so far, Chapman says. But getting people who are less enthusiastic has proved more challenging. Many governments and companies have tried to prod people, initially with incentives, later with mandates.</p>

<p>Free doughnuts, direct cash payments and entry into million-dollar lottery jackpots were among the many perks rolled out. Before the pandemic, such incentives had been shown to prompt some people to get vaccines, says Harsha Thirumurthy, a behavioral economist at the University of Pennsylvania. This time, <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3912786">those incentives made little difference</a> nationwide, Thirumurthy and his colleagues reported in September in a preliminary study posted to SSRN, a social sciences preprint website. “It’s possible they moved the needle 1 or 2 percentage points, but we’ve ruled out that they had a large effect,” he says. Some studies of incentives offered by individual states have found a marginal benefit.</p>



<p>“People who are worried about side effects or safety are going to be more difficult to reach,” says Melanie Kornides, an epidemiologist at the University of Pennsylvania. And with vaccination status tangled up in personal identity, “you’re just not going to influence lots of people with a mass communication campaign right now; it’s really about individual conversations,” she says, preferably with someone trusted.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-pullquote alignright"><blockquote><p>&#8220;You&#8217;re just not going to influence lots of people with a mass communication campaign right now; it&#8217;s really about individual conversations.&#8221;</p><cite> Melanie Kornides, epidemiologist</cite></blockquote></figure>



<p>“Or,” she adds, “they’re going to respond to mandates.” Historically, sticks such as being fired from a job or barred from school are the most effective way of boosting vaccination rates, Kornides says. For example, hospitals that require flu shots for workers <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/21645515.2015.1106656">tend to have higher vaccination rates</a> than those that don’t. For decades, mandates in schools have helped push vaccination rates up for diseases like measles and chickenpox, she says.</p>



<p>As COVID-19 mandates went into effect in the fall, news headlines often focused on protests and refusals. Yet early anecdotal evidence suggests some mandates have helped. For instance, after New York City public schools announced a vaccine requirement in late August for its roughly 150,000 employees, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/10/04/nyregion/vaccine-mandate-teachers-nyc.html?">nearly 96 percent</a> had received at least one shot by early November. Still, about 8,000 employees opted not to get vaccinated and were placed on unpaid leave, the <em>New York Times</em> reported.</p>



<p>Many people remain vehemently opposed to the vaccines, in part because of rampant misinformation that can spread quickly online. Whether more mandates, from the government or private companies, and targeted outreach will convince them remains to be seen. — <em>Jonathan Lambert</em></p>



<h3>Vaccines can’t single-handedly end the pandemic</h3>



<p>One year in, it’s clear that vaccination is one of the best tools we have to control COVID-19. But it’s also clear vaccines alone can’t end the pandemic.</p>



<p>While the jabs do <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coronavirus-covid-vaccine-moderna-pfizer-transmission-disease">a pretty good job preventing infections</a>, that protection wanes over time (<em>SN Online: 3/30/21</em>). Still, the vaccines have “worked spectacularly well” at protecting most people from severe disease, says Luning Prak, the University of Pennsylvania immunologist. And as more people around the world get vaccinated, fewer people will die, even if they do fall ill with COVID-19.</p>



<p>“We have to make a distinction between the superficial infections you can get — [like a] runny nose — versus the lower respiratory tract stuff that can kill you,” such as inflammation in the lungs that causes low oxygen levels, Luning Prak says. Preventing severe disease is the fundamental target that most vaccines, including the flu shot, hit, she notes. Stopping infection entirely “was never a realistic goal.”</p>



<figure class="wp-block-pullquote alignright"><blockquote><p>&#8220;We have to make a distinction between the superficial infections you can get — [like a] runny nose — versus the lower respiratory tract stuff that can kill you.&#8221;</p><cite>Nina Luning Prak, immunologist</cite></blockquote></figure>



<p>Because vaccines aren’t an impenetrable barrier against the virus, we’ll still need to rely on other tactics to help control spread amid the pandemic. “Vaccines are not the sole tool in our toolbox,” says Saad Omer, an epidemiologist at Yale University. “They should be used with other things,” such as masks to help block exposure and COVID-19 tests to help people know when they should stay home.</p>



<p>For now, it’s crucial to have such layered protection, Omer says. “But in the long run, I think vaccines provide a way to get back to at least a new normal.” With vaccines, people can gather at school, concerts or weddings with less fear of a large outbreak.</p>



<p>Eventually the pandemic will end, though when is still anyone’s guess. But the end certainly won’t mean that COVID-19 has disappeared.</p>



<p>Many experts agree that the coronavirus will most likely remain with us for the foreseeable future, sparking outbreaks in places where there are pockets of susceptible people. Susceptibility can come in many forms: Young children who have never encountered the virus before and can’t yet get vaccinated, people who choose not to get the vaccine and people whose immunity has waned after an infection or vaccination. Or the virus may evolve in ways that help it evade the immune system.</p>



<p>The pandemic’s end may still feel out of reach, with the high hopes from the beginning of 2021 a distant memory. Still, hints of normalcy have returned: Kids are back in school, restaurants and stores are open and people are traveling more.</p>



<p>Vaccines have proved to be an invaluable tool to reduce the death and destruction that the coronavirus can leave in its wake. <em>— Erin Garcia de Jesús</em></p>

                <p><em>By&nbsp;</em><a href="http://emilyoliviareynolds.com/">Emily Reynolds</a></p>



<p>From early 2020, concerns were raised about the impact of the pandemic on mental health. The stresses of lockdown, social isolation, financial precarity, and widespread grief were all considered to be potential triggers for poor mental health, along with issues such as increased <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2021/09/15/domestic-violence-increased-during-lockdown-in-the-united-states/">domestic violence</a>.</p>



<p>A <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-021-04099-6">new study</a>, published in <em>Nature</em>, looks at what helpline calls can reveal about mental health during this period. It finds an increase in calls to helplines during the early days of the pandemic, largely driven by fear, loneliness, and worries about physical health.</p>



<span id="more-44813"></span>



<p>Marius Brülhart from the University of Lausanne and colleagues used data from both general crisis lines and specific suicide prevention lines, as well as those focusing on children, parents, and immigrants. Data was collected from January 2019 to the most recent available date in order to cover the period before and during the pandemic, with 8 million calls from 19 countries included in the dataset.</p>



<p>First, the team looked at call volumes, before zooming in on the conversational topics raised by callers. For each helpline, calls were categorised based on topic, including loneliness, fear, suicidality, addiction, violence, physical health, work situation, and relationships. Demographic data was collected here if possible, including marital status, living situation, and work situation. Government responses of helpline countries were also measured, including how stringent restrictions were and how much governments were supporting people financially.</p>



<p>The team found an increase in calls during the pandemic, in particular in the six weeks after the first outbreak. A significant increase began at week three and this peaked at week six, at which point the volume of calls exceeded pre-pandemic levels by 35%.</p>



<p>In terms of conversational topics, most pre-COVID calls were made because of relationship issues, loneliness, or anxiety; 61% of calls were from women and 63% placed by people between the ages of 30 and 60. However, during the pandemic, conversational topics shifted. The biggest increase in calls placed during the pandemic period were those related to fear&nbsp;—&nbsp;whether of COVID-19 itself or of the ramifications of lockdown.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>



<p>Calls related to loneliness also increased, with other conversational topics coming up less frequently during the first wave of the pandemic. Compared to pre-COVID, callers were less likely to seek help for relationship issues, economic worries, and addiction, though there was no significant change in the percentage of calls related to suicidal ideation.</p>



<p>Demographically speaking, the increase in calls related to fear was driven almost entirely by those over the age of 30, which tracks with the increasing level of risk of contracting COVID with age. Women under the age of 30 were more likely to call because of violence than they were before the pandemic. But overall, the increase in call volume was driven by fears of the virus and of loneliness rather than by these other factors.</p>



<p>Many of these figures could be underestimates in terms of who was struggling and with what —&nbsp;during strict lockdowns, it may have been difficult for people to access helplines, particularly if they were subject to domestic violence or had no privacy in talking through their suicidal ideation. There will also have been many who didn’t call crisis lines but who were nonetheless experiencing distress. The results, therefore, do not contradict those other pieces of research that detected an increase in domestic violence.</p>



<p>The results offer a unique insight into people’s mental health over the period of the pandemic. Many people will have been experiencing distress; not all of them will meet thresholds to be assessed by mental health professionals, nor may even want to visit them in the first place. Helpline calls, therefore, could give greater access to feelings people found hard, painting a more accurate picture of how we experienced the pandemic.</p>

<p>Sauropods, a group of long-necked plant-eating dinosaurs, were the largest animals to have ever walked the earth. In this study, Melstrom and colleagues demonstrate that sauropods evolved a unique feeding strategy that helped them dominate their environments for over 100 million years.</p>
<p>Dental complexity, a measure of the number of features on a 3D tooth surface, is closely linked to an animal’s diet. For example, meat-eaters typically have simple sharp teeth for ripping flesh, while plant-eaters have complex teeth with many cusps and ridges to grind down fibrous vegetation. Using computerised tomography (CT) and microCT scanning, Melstrom and colleagues analysed 3D models of Late Jurassic dinosaur teeth from around the globe. The group compared the dental complexity of carnivorous theropods, herbivorous ornithischians and herbivorous sauropods.</p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">As expected, meat-eating theropods had simple sharp teeth while plant-eating ornithischians had more complex teeth. However, in stark contrast to herbivores living today, sauropods had mostly simple teeth. Furthermore, sauropods replaced their simple teeth faster than more complex teeth. Some sauropods like </span><em><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Apatosaurus</span></em><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> and </span><em><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Diplodocus </span></em><span data-preserver-spaces="true">exhibited remarkably simple &#8216;peg-like&#8217; teeth with incredibly fast replacement rates, which possibly allowed them to eat different foods from other sauropods like </span><em><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Brachiosaurus</span></em><span data-preserver-spaces="true">, which had more complex teeth. Given that simple teeth weigh less, reducing the skull&#8217;s weight, the simple teeth of sauropods could have reduced the strain on their long necks.</span></p>

<p>Open science practices, including the deposition of data in public repositories, bring significant benefits to individual researchers, research communities and society. Making data publicly available increases the transparency, reproducibility and speed of dissemination of research. Consequently, transformative open science policies are increasingly becoming standard worldwide. In this commentary, BMC Research Notes senior Editorial Board Member Diego Forero and colleagues discuss the value of data sharing in open repositories as well as the challenges and strategies for the success of open science. The commentary highlights that in times of COVID-19, adherence to international standards for depositing open data in public repositories is now more important than ever.</p>

<p>How long is the virus responsible for the current COVID-19 pandemic stable and infectious for on Personal Protective Equipment (PPE)? In this <em>in vitro</em> study, Córdoba-Lanús and colleagues evaluated SARS-CoV-2 stability and viability on PPE gowns and FFP2 (KN 95) face masks infected by the virus.</p>
<p>Genomic analyses by real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) revealed that SARS-CoV-2 genomic material remains on PPE for up to 30 days post contamination. In addition, via a cell-based assay using Vero-E6 host cells that measures the cytopathic effect of the virus, the researchers demonstrated that SARS-CoV-2 contaminated PPE materials remain infectious for up to 7 days. These findings could help improve PPE use and management to avoid SARS-CoV-2 infection from these items after the wearer has removed them, even after several days.</p>

<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Transposable elements (TEs), also known as &#8220;jumping genes&#8221;, make up almost half of our genetic material. TEs are highly repetitive DNA sequences capable of mobilising themselves and increasing their copy number in the host genome. Historically, many scientists dismissed these TEs as useless &#8220;junk&#8221; DNA. However, these mobile elements are now known to have a multitude of biological functions. TEs can have neutral, beneficial, and harmful effects and contribute to human genetic variation and disease.</span></p>

Interestingly, the RMS catalogue is enriched for contributions to germline genetic disorders and somatic insertions in diverse cancers. These RMSs are primarily found within open chromatin regions associated with active DNA regulatory elements &#8211; therefore, the group speculates that they could be involved in regulating gene expression.

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/sleep-creativity-neuroscience-brain">How sleep may boost creativity</a></h4>

              
                <p>The twilight time between fully awake and sound asleep may be packed with creative potential.</p>



<p>People who recently drifted off into a light sleep later <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.abj5866">had problem-solving power</a>, scientists report December 8 in <em>Science Advances. </em>The results help demystify the fleeting early moments of sleep and may even point out ways to boost creativity.</p>



<p>Prolific inventor and catnapper Thomas Edison was rumored to chase those twilight moments. He was said to fall asleep in a chair holding two steel ball bearings over metal pans. As he drifted off, the balls would fall. The ensuing clatter would wake him, and he could rescue his inventive ideas before they were lost to the depths of sleep.</p>



<p>Delphine Oudiette, a cognitive neuroscientist at the Paris Brain Institute, and colleagues took inspiration from Edison’s method of cultivating creativity. She and her colleagues brought 103 healthy people to their lab to solve a tricky number problem. The volunteers were asked to convert a string of numbers into a shorter sequence, following two simple rules. What the volunteers weren’t told was that there was an easy trick: The second number in the sequence would always be the correct final number, too. Once discovered, this cheat code dramatically cut the solving time.</p>





<p>After doing 60 of these trials on a computer, the volunteers earned a 20-minute break in a quiet, dark room. Reclined and holding an equivalent of Edison’s “alarm clock” (a light drinking bottle in one dangling hand), participants were asked to close their eyes and rest or sleep if they desired. All the while, electrodes monitored their brain waves.</p>



<p>About half of the participants stayed awake. Twenty-four fell asleep and stayed in the shallow, fleeting stage of sleep called N1. Fourteen people progressed to a deeper stage of sleep called N2.</p>



<p>After their rest, participants returned to their number problem. The researchers saw a stark difference between the groups: People who had fallen into a shallow, early sleep were 2.7 times as likely to spot the hidden trick as people who didn’t fall asleep, and 5.8 times as likely to spot it as people who had reached the deeper N2 stage.</p>



<p>Such drastic differences in these types of experiments are rare, Oudiette says. “We were quite astonished by the extent of the results.” The researchers also identified a “creative cocktail of brain waves,” as Oudiette puts it, that seemed to accompany this twilight stage — a mixture of alpha brain waves that usually mark relaxation mingled with the delta waves of deeper sleep.</p>



<p>The study doesn’t show that the time spent in N1 actually triggered the later realization, cautions John Kounios, a cognitive neuroscientist at Drexel University in Philadelphia who cowrote the 2015 book <em>The Eureka Factor: Aha Moments, Creative Insight, and the Brain</em>. “It could have been possible that grappling with the problem and initiating an incubation process caused both N1 and the subsequent insight,” he says, making N1 a “by-product of the processes that caused insight rather than the cause.”<br><br>More work is needed to untangle the connection between N1 and creativity, Oudiette says. But the results raise a tantalizing possibility, one that harkens to Edison’s self-optimizations: People might be able to learn to reach that twilight stage of sleep, or to produce the cocktail of brain waves associated with creativity on demand.</p>



<p>It seems Edison was onto something about the creative powers of nodding off. But don’t put too much stock in his habits. He is also said to have considered sleep “a criminal waste of time.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/bacteria-virus-phage-shigellosis-arms-race">A bacteria-virus arms race could lead to a new way to treat shigellosis</a></h4>

              
                <p>When some bacteria manage to escape being killed by a virus, the microbes end up hamstringing themselves. And that could be useful in the fight to treat infections.</p>



<p>The bacterium<em> Shigella flexneri </em>— one cause of the infectious disease shigellosis — can spread within cells that line the gut by propelling itself through the cells’ barriers. That causes tissue damage that can lead to symptoms like bloody diarrhea. But when <em>S. flexneri</em> in lab dishes evolved to elude a type of bacteria-killing virus, the bacteria couldn’t <a href="https://journals.asm.org/doi/10.1128/AEM.01514-21">spread cell to cell anymore,</a> making it less virulent, researchers report November 17 in <em>Applied and Environmental Microbiology</em>.</p>



<p>The research is a hopeful sign for what’s known as <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/viruses-slay-bacteria-draw-new-interest">phage therapy</a> (<em>SN: 11/20/02</em>). With <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/cdc-drug-resistant-microbes-kill-about-35000-people-united-states-per-year">antibiotic-resistant microbes on the rise</a>, some researchers see viruses that infect and kill only bacteria, known as bacteriophages or just phages, as a potential option to treat antibiotic-resistant infections (<em>SN: 11/13/19</em>). With phage therapy, infected people are given doses of a particular phage, which kill off the problematic bacteria. The problem, though, is that over time those bacteria can evolve to be resistant against the phage, too.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>“We’re kind of expecting phage therapy to fail, in a sense,” says Paul Turner, an evolutionary biologist and virologist at Yale University. “Bacteria are very good at evolving resistance to phages.”</p>





<p>But that doesn’t mean the bacteria emerge unscathed. Some phages attack and enter bacteria by latching onto bacterial proteins crucial for a microbe’s function. If phage therapy treatments relied on such a virus, that could push the bacteria to evolve in such a way that not only helps them escape the virus but also impairs their abilities and makes them less deadly. People infected with these altered bacteria might have less severe symptoms or may not show symptoms at all.</p>



<p>Previous studies with the bacteria <em>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</em>, for instance, have found that phage and bacteria can engage in evolutionary battles that <a href="https://academic.oup.com/emph/article/2018/1/60/4923328">drive the bacteria to be more sensitive to antibiotics</a>. The new study hints that researchers could leverage the arms race between <em>S. flexneri </em>and the newly identified phage, which was dubbed A1-1 after being found in Mexican wastewater, to treat shigellosis.</p>



<p><em>S. flexneri </em>in contaminated water is a huge problem in parts of the world where clean water isn’t always available, such as sub-Saharan Africa and southern Asia, says Kaitlyn Kortright, a microbiologist also at Yale University. Every year, approximately 1.3 million people die from shigellosis, which is caused by four <em>Shigella</em> species. More than half of those deaths are in children younger than 5 years old. What’s more, antibiotics to treat shigellosis can be expensive and hard to access in those places. And <em>S. flexneri </em>is becoming resistant to many antibiotics. Phage therapy could be a cheaper, more accessible option to treat the infection.</p>



<p>The blow to <em>S. flexneri</em>’s cellular spread comes because to enter cells, A1-1 targets a protein called OmpA, which is crucial for the bacteria to rupture host cell membranes. The researchers found two types of mutations that made <em>S. flexneri </em>resistant to A1-1. Some bacteria had mutations in the gene that produces OmpA, damaging the protein’s ability to help the microbes spread from cell to cell. Others had changes to a structural component of bacterial cells called lipopolysaccharide.</p>



<p>The mutations in lipopolysaccharide were surprising, Kortright says, because the relationship between that structural component and OmpA isn’t fully worked out. One possibility is that those mutations distort OmpA’s structure in a way that the phage no longer recognizes it and can’t enter bacterial cells.</p>



<p>One lingering question is whether <em>S. flexneri </em>evolves in the same way outside a lab dish, says Saima Aslam, an infectious diseases physician at the University of California, San Diego who was not involved in the work. Still, the findings show that it’s “not always a bad thing” when bacteria become phage-resistant, she says.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/cicada-science-brood-x-2021">Cicada science heats up when Brood X emerges. 2021 was no exception</a></h4>

              
                <p class="has-drop-cap" style="font-size:20px">In one of history’s weird coincidences, the second summer of a global pandemic brought Johns Hopkins biologist Ethan Allen Andrews out on a Baltimore lawn to watch the massive Brood X cicada mating frenzy. The year was 1919 and a great influenza was still spreading around the world.</p>



<p>In 2021, the second summer of a different pandemic with many heartbreaking parallels, Brood X cicadas again sent people in the eastern United States onto their lawns in wonder, or into hiding from the mini projectiles and their high-decibel din.</p>



<p>Every 17 years, big-eyed Brood X <em>Magicicada</em> bugs as fat as fingers and defenseless as gummy bears fumble out of the ground by the millions. They orient toward various trees as if mystically called, then seethe over lawns in masses to converge and climb. “Astonishing,” Andrews called the view near a large tree. And that was before the mobs took their adult flying form and, after 17 asexual years, the males finally chorused for females.</p>



<p>“Ear drums nearly shattered by boiler-foundry din,” the <em>Baltimore Sun</em> exclaimed on May 30, 1919. Yet Andrews sounded thrilled. For three years, he had dug test holes to check on the young cicadas maturing underground. When they finally crawled into daylight, he sampled and calculated. “The entire number emerging from an acre of such suburban land runs up toward one hundred thousand,” he estimated.</p>





<p>Six Brood X cicada–lifetimes later (102 years), the most recent crop of the big, goofy bugs clambered above ground on schedule in patches scattered across 15 states. Despite the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, researchers took to the field, or the lawn.</p>



<h4>All together now</h4>



<p><em>Magicicada</em> species live hypercoordinated, “periodical” lives. To be considered periodical, a whole geographic population, called a brood, must live through a multiyear life cycle, synchronizing big events. North America’s periodical cicadas, depending on location, emerge either every 13 or 17 years, mating only in the last month or so of life. Imagine, for a second, whole cities of humans who hit some of the big milestones of life — being born, having babies and then dying — within weeks of each other.</p>



<p>A periodic life cycle is rare, but not unique, says biologist Chris Simon of the University of Connecticut in Storrs. Out of the million or so named insect species, she knows of more than 50 with periodic lives — hardly an overwhelming number. Thirty-eight species of moths and butterflies live like this. So do at least four kinds of beetles and even a fly.</p>



<p>Among the estimated 3,000 cicada species, just a few kinds live so tightly in lockstep. For the various North American cicadas, only <em>Magicicada</em> species synchronize. Brood X may get a lot of publicity, but there are 14 other broods, all but one mixing more than one species.</p>



<p>Brood X mingles three species, which Simon’s well-tuned ear can identify by the males’ mating calls: the angry chipmunk call of <em>M. septendecula</em>, <em>M. cassini</em> with its ticking that winds up to a raspy scream and <em>M. septendecim</em>, known for its whistling spaceship drone. Females just click.</p>



<p>“We used to think only North America had periodical cicadas,” Simon says. And that the cycles were all odd-numbered. “We” however means Western scientists. A small expanse of India has its “World Cup” cicada (<em>Chremistica ribhoi</em>), which appears on the same four-year cycle as the soccer competition. Among Fiji’s cicadas, the gold-and-black nanai (<em>Raiateana knowlesi</em>) bursts out on the main island every eight years. It has replaced Queen Elizabeth on the South Pacific country’s $100 bill.</p>

<h4>When life gives you cicadas</h4>



<p>This year, as Simon went south for intensive Brood X mapping in North Carolina and Georgia, she bought Brewed X coffee in Washington, D.C. She’s been immersed in the fascinating world of cicadas for decades, and collects instances of cicadas touching human culture. She can quote from a 1987 newspaper story reporting two men “brandishing” a cicada in a suspected robbery at the Grand Slam restaurant in Cincinnati, and she has a 2011 photo of the window of the beloved Sparky’s ice cream parlor in Columbia, Mo. The shop had sold out of cicada ice cream, so the staff taped up a note: “Check back in 2024.”</p>



<p>Looking back over her travels and worldwide research, this year Simon and long-time colleagues <a href="https://www.annualreviews.org/doi/abs/10.1146/annurev-ento-072121-061108">updated a synthesis of ideas</a> about how <em>Magicicada</em> species evolved in three main lineages that diverged from a common ancestor some 3.9 million years ago. The periodical lifestyle evolved along with them, the researchers wrote online October 8 in the <em>Annual Review of Entomology.</em></p>



<p>One factor on the path to periodicity is what Simon calls “predator fool­hardiness.” <em>Magicicada</em> adults are big and weirdly easy to catch. They only halfheartedly try to escape predators. Even though birds, squirrels and plenty of other animals gorge on the easy meals, a sufficiently huge burst of cicadas can feed all the menaces and still leave enough survivors to reproduce. Reaching such mind-boggling abundance is easier when youngsters from a whole swath of countryside burst out of the ground together every 17 years.</p>



<p>This coordination can fit with a nutrient­-skimpy diet and slow growth. Developing <em>Magicicada</em> youngsters tap tree roots for food, but ignore the higher-calorie fluid that carries sugars downward from the leaves. Instead, young cicadas drive their mouthparts into the up-sucking xylem, which carries roughly 99.9 percent water, with just a smidge of nutrients, from roots.</p>



<p>Feeding this way is hard work. To sip even such weak broth means a hard fight against the plant’s strong upward draw of fluids. To get the job done, cicadas, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/froghoppers-suction-insects-biophysics">like other xylem specialists</a> (<em>SN: 8/14/21, p. 14</em>), grow specialized power pumps in their heads.</p>

<h4>Spreading wings</h4>



<p>Cicadas’ foolhardiness coupled with their extraordinary numbers brought a research bonanza for Mary Salcedo, a biomechanist at Virginia Tech in Blacksburg. She studies how newly adult insects quickly pump up their massive wings from the early squished-together tissue pads. Speed matters, as flightless means defenseless.</p>



<p>Cicadas can pump up their wings in only about 45 minutes. After studying the wings of lab locusts and grasshoppers, she enthusiastically turned to <em>Magicicada</em>: “Thousands of insects I don’t have to rear or care for!”</p>



<p>Before the first of Brood X pushed out of the ground this year, Salcedo booked an Airbnb rental outside Washington, D.C., for 10 (fully vaccinated) people from the Virginia Tech lab of biomechanist Jake Socha. The pandemic shut Socha’s lab in 2020, so the trip helped Ph.D. student Joshua Pulliam, for one, in his dramatic swerve to study cicada motion. He’s finding a way to fit insect climbing into his Ph.D. project on snakes that glide so well <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/how-flying-snakes-stay-aloft">they just about fly</a> (<em>SN: 8/1/20, p. 16</em>).</p>

<p>Salcedo has long wondered how insects manage to get huge wings flight-ready so fast. “Most people — I found, even some entomologists — think of an insect wing as like your hair,” she says. “But it’s … more like your arm.”</p>



<p>Instead of just inert stuff, insect wings have networks with nerves, airways and insect “blood,” or hemolymph. That complex system takes a lot of circulatory power, including extra hearts, says Salcedo, who is working with colleagues on a cicada wings paper. Cicadas have one central heart, plus more for the wings.</p>



<p>Unlike locusts and grasshoppers, which have a two-step wing reveal, the periodical cicada pulls its wings open all at once, like “pulling a sword out of a sheath,” Salcedo says. She Zoom-shares images of Brood X cicadas she caught and photographed during the recent excursion as they stretched out their wings for the first time. The starting shapes look like small, white sails with yellow squiggles. As those squiggles expand, the wings flare wider and longer, gradually coming to life.</p>

<h4>Mind control</h4>



<p>Forest pathologist Matt Kasson and his students also went cicada hunting in 2021, but not just any Brood X bumbler would do. Based at West Virginia University in Morgantown, the group searched in the Shenandoah Valley and nearby mountains for cicadas infected with a fungus that renders cicadas sterile but juices up their sex drive, maximizing fungal spread by mating contact.</p>



<p>“You have a cicada walking around with, basically, a chalky gumdrop [of fungus] on the backside of its abdomen,” Kasson says. These <em>Massospora</em> fungi drive males to mimic the flirtatious clicks of females, attracting other males. The duped males eventually catch on and clatter away, but they carry infectious fungi away with them.</p>



<p>Students Angie Macias and Matt Berger came up with the idea to study these fungi more than five years ago. There was no way to grow <em>Massospora</em> in labs, but the fungi attack both periodical and nonperiodical cicada species. One of the group’s first projects used nonperiodical cicadas from the American West to explore what chemistry could let a fungus energize insect sexual behavior.</p>



<p>“I get a call one snowy night in February at 2 in the morning,” Kasson remembers. It was from grad student Greg Boyce. He had a day job at a biotech company that let him use — after hours but for free — very expensive instruments to identify substances produced as an organism metabolizes. So in the dark of night, Boyce asked his adviser, “You know what psilocybin is?’’</p>

<p>Boyce had found that the legendary ingredient in a kind of magic mushroom, of all things, turned up naturally in a <em>Massospora</em> that attacks wing-banger cicadas (<em>Platypedia putnami</em>) from New Mexico.</p>



<p>By daylight “we were just like, holy crap!” Kasson says. This was especially surprising because the trippy mushrooms are far, far away from <em>Massospora</em> fungi in evolutionary history. The cicada attackers are in a whole different phylum, “way lower” on the fungal tree of life. Kasson thinks the same compound must have evolved twice, maybe a couple hundred million years apart.</p>



<p>“We got a bunch of colleagues looped in on that, and everybody was going nuts.” The big question was, did the periodical cicadas’ version of <em>Massospora</em> also have psilocybin?</p>



<p>The answer is, no. What turns out to drive periodical cicadas to hypersexed flirtation is a different stimulant: an amphetamine called cathinone. That same ingredient puts the kick in the khat plant, popularly chewed in the Middle East and not at all related to a fungus.</p>



<p>Eventually it dawned on Kasson that his cicada collecting had inadvertently filled his university lab with controlled substances for which he had no permits. “I wrote the most awkward letter of my life to the DEA,” he says.</p>



<p>In the end, the lab got squared away with the Drug Enforcement Administration. Insect mating–enhancement drugs have now become yet another tidbit of science that cicada watchers can muse over the next time their lawns start crawling.</p>

But in this case, the charge goes a bit deeper – less cribbing a few lines of the &#8230; <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2021/12/14/paper-retracted-because-authors-misrepresented-a-published-theoretical-model-as-if-they-had-found-it/" class="more-link">Continue reading <span class="screen-reader-text">Paper retracted because authors ‘misrepresented a published theoretical model as if they had found it’</span></a>

                <p><em>By guest blogger&nbsp;</em><a href="https://twitter.com/sofia_deleniv">Sofia Deleniv</a></p>



<p>Over the past ten years, developmental psychologists have been astounded by the young age at which children appear to be aware of the moral qualities of others’ actions. At just four months, babies already react with surprise <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6389704/">when others engage in unequal distribution of treats and resources</a>. They also <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5461303/">snub these unfair individuals</a> in social interactions by the age of 24 months and <a href="https://www.pnas.org/content/116/13/6025">expect others to do the same</a><a href="https://www.pnas.org/content/116/13/6025"></a>. Other forms of moral judgement may emerge even sooner: as early as 3 months of age, <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2966030/">infants show distinct preferences for those who help</a>, as opposed to hinder, others.</p>



<p>In thinking about these nascent moral judgements, researchers have become interested in figuring out their underlying mental “structure”. Do children’s moral rules operate like a loose “‘anthology”, where judgements passed on the basis of one principle have little effect on judgements on the basis of another? Or is there a deeper underpinning mental framework that gives rise to a multitude of connected moral expectations? &nbsp;</p>



<p>A <a href="https://www.pnas.org/content/118/39/e2109045118">recent study in <em>PNAS</em></a> by a duo of American researchers breaks new ground on this fascinating question. It reveals that toddlers are guided by a core mental representation of what it means to be a moral person (albeit with some potentially concerning caveats). Within this moral framework, a single faux pas risks entirely sweeping an individual from a child’s good books. &nbsp;</p>



<span id="more-44884"></span>



<p>In their set of experiments, the researchers examined how 25-month-old toddlers reacted to a series of morally loaded social interactions staged during a puppet show. The toddlers were first introduced to two dog puppets before observing one of them subject the other to a harmful action that ranged from crumpling up their drawing to knocking down a toy tower they had made.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Next came the crucial question. Would the toddlers be surprised if the perpetrator engaged in an entirely different sort of moral transgression in another setting? To test this, the researchers staged a scenario in which the dog discovered two toys and decided how to divide this lucky find between two excited puppets. Children were randomly selected to see one of two possible endings to this story: a fair outcome, where each recipient got a toy, or an unfair one where the dog inexplicably snubbed one of the puppets and gave both toys to just one.</p>



<p>The researchers found that toddlers who viewed the fair outcome spent significantly more time gazing at the interaction. This observation — which developmental psychologists <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4215956/">widely accept to indicate surprise</a> — suggested that the children didn’t quite expect someone who acted as a bully to make fair decisions in a different context. The finding indicates that children judge others from a holistic perspective of what being moral really means. In their view, a single action that is at odds with one aspect of a “good” representation implies that the individual should be expected to violate other moral principles.</p>



<p>But there’s a catch — it turns out that seeing an individual mistreating someone else does not <em>always</em> cause children to expect them to behave immorally in the future. The researchers saw this when they repeated their experiment, except this time the toddlers first witnessed a dog puppet mistreating a rabbit (as opposed to a fellow dog) before watching the dog share out a pair of toys. &nbsp;</p>



<p>In this scenario, toddlers gazed longer when the dog went on to make an unequal sharing decision, suggesting that they still expected the puppet to be fair. Only when the researchers ensured that the dog engaged in <em>three </em>sequential acts of bullying towards the rabbit did the children’s gaze patterns suggest that they no longer expected it to act fairly in the next social interaction. &nbsp;</p>



<p>While this outcome is not entirely surprising (other studies have documented children <a href="https://www.pnas.org/content/114/31/8199">expecting others to give their in-group members special treatment</a>), the present study is the first to discover something profound about the way children make their moral judgements, flawed as they might be. That is, the moral principles that children use do not operate in arbitrary isolation. They stem from a core mental representation of what makes someone a moral person.&nbsp;Whether this representation is “hardwired” or amenable to changes through development, experience, and age is an exciting question for future research to address.</p>



<p>&#8211; <a href="https://www.pnas.org/content/118/39/e2109045118">Toddlers draw broad negative inferences from wrongdoers’ moral violations</a></p>
