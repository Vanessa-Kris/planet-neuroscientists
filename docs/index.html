              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/gas-flare-leak-methane-burning-climate">Gas flares are leaking five times as much methane than previously thought</a></h4>

              
                <p>In many oil and gas producing regions, flames light the sky. The flares burn off 98 percent of the escaping natural gas, oil and gas companies claim. But observations of three U.S. oil and gas fields show efficiency is <a href="http://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.abq0385">only around 91 percent</a>, scientists report in the Sept. 30 <em>Science</em>. Making up the difference would be the equivalent of taking nearly 3 million cars off the road.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The natural gas escaping is primarily methane. This greenhouse gas lingers for only nine to 10 years in the atmosphere, but its warming potential is 80 times that of carbon dioxide. So oil and gas companies light flares — burning the methane to produce less-potent carbon dioxide and water. The industry and the U.S. government assumed those flares worked at 98 percent efficiency. But previous studies said <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/permian-basin-oil-region-leaking-twice-methane-once-thought">that might be too optimistic</a>, says Genevieve Plant, an atmospheric scientist at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor (<em>SN: 4/22/20</em>).</p>





<p>Plant and her colleagues sent planes to sample air over more than 300 flares in the Bakken Basin in North Dakota and the Permian and Eagle Ford basins in Texas, which account for more than 80 percent of the flaring in the country. The samples showed five times as much methane unburned than previously estimated.</p>



<p>The drop from 98 to 91 percent efficiency might seem small, but the effects are large, says Dan Cusworth, an atmospheric scientist at the University of Arizona in Tucson who was not involved in the study. “Any percentage that is in the methane phase instead of CO<sub>2</sub> phase is substantially more problematic.”</p>



<p>Half of the difference is due to flares that aren’t burning. “We expected that flares might show a range of efficiencies, but we did not expect to see so many unlit flares,” Plant says. Between 3 and 5 percent of flares weren’t working at all. If those fires were lit, and 98 percent efficiency achieved, the result could remove the equivalent of about 13 million metric tons of carbon from the atmosphere. Light ‘em up.&nbsp;</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/crying-baby-sleep-science">How to get a crying baby to sleep, according to science</a></h4>

              
                <p>It’s a frustration many parents know all too well: You’ve finally lulled your crying baby to sleep, so you put them down in their crib … and the wailing begins again. Science may have a trick for you.</p>



<p>Carrying a crying infant for about five minutes, then sitting for at least another five to eight minutes can calm and lull the baby to sleep long enough to allow a parent <a href="https://www.cell.com/current-biology/fulltext/S0960-9822(22)01363-X#%20">to put the child down without waking them</a>, researchers report September 13 in <em>Current Biology</em>.</p>





<p>Some of those same researchers previously showed that <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/infants-whether-mice-or-human-love-be-carried">carrying a crying baby soothes the child and calms a racing heart rate</a> (<em>SN: 4/18/13</em>). For the new study, the team looked at what it takes to get that crying baby to nod off and stay asleep.</p>



<p>The researchers put heart rate monitors on 21 crying babies, ranging in age from newborns to 7 months old. The team also took videos of the infants, monitoring their moods as their mothers carried them around a room, sat holding them and laid them in a crib. That allowed the team to observe how the babies responded to different environments, whether they were crying, fussy, alert or drowsy, heartbeat by heartbeat.</p>



<p>“We tested the physiology behind these things that tend to be kind of common knowledge, though it’s not really well understood why they work,” says Gianluca Esposito, a developmental psychologist at the University of Trento in Italy. &nbsp;</p>



<p>The babies’ heart rates slowed and they stopped crying when their mothers picked them up and carried them around for five minutes. Some infants even fell asleep. But the researchers also noticed that the babies tended to respond to the movement of the parent, whether they were in deep sleep or not. For instance, a baby’s heart rate quickened if a parent turned quickly while walking or tried to put the baby down.</p>



<p>Sitting seems to smooth that transition from walking to bed, the team observed. Babies cradled in mom’s lap for at least five minutes tended to settle into a slower heart rate and stayed asleep once they were put in their crib. In contrast, the heart rates of six babies whose moms sat with them for less than five minutes accelerated once they were laid down and they woke up soon after.</p>



<p>There’s a lot of research about the relationship between infants and mothers, “but I had not seen work showing that infants were responding to mothers’ behaviors while infants were sleeping,” says Sarah Berger, a developmental psychologist at the College of Staten Island in New York who was not a part of the study.</p>



<p>Both Berger and Esposito caution this method isn’t a magic wand for all babies. It doesn’t rule out sleepless nights, but still, it’s something that parents can try, Esposito says. And while this study was done with mothers, anyone that an infant is comfortable with can do it. “Especially for very, very young kids … as long as these caregivers are familiar with the kid, it’s going to work,” he says.</p>

<p>If you saw Carlos Argüelles-Delgado’s childhood bedroom — the whiteboard for working out problems, the math textbooks they asked for as birthday gifts — you’d likely not be surprised that this kid would grow up to push the boundaries of modern physics.</p>



<p>For years, physicists have known that the most successful theory to describe what the universe is made of, called the standard model, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/higgs-boson-particle-physics-standard-model-discovery-anniversary">is broken</a>. By prying at one of the biggest cracks in the framework — neutrinos — Argüelles aims to discover what’s next for the field.</p>





<p>Neutrinos are mysterious even for subatomic particles. They’re hard to study because they barely interact with matter, and what scientists do know about them is baffling — like the fact that neutrinos have mass when the standard model predicts <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/neutrinos-identity-shift-snares-physics-nobel">they shouldn’t</a>. “That’s why I like neutrinos,” Argüelles says. “They misbehave.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Many scientists think this confusing behavior is a sign that neutrinos are affected by undiscovered particles. In that case, demystifying neutrinos could open a new window on the universe. The question is: Who are these hidden partners, and how can scientists find them?</p>





<h4>Standout research</h4>



<p>To search for answers, Argüelles often relies on data from the IceCube Neutrino Observatory in Antarctica. IceCube’s thousands of buried detectors spot neutrinos from the faint flashes of light they leave after interacting with ice<em>.</em></p>



<p>For their Ph.D., Argüelles combed through these signals to look for “sterile” neutrinos. If this breed of neutrinos exists, they would interact with matter even less than normal neutrinos do. Sterile neutrinos could explain several troubling problems with the standard model, like why neutrinos have mass and <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/neutrino-particle-universe-matter-antimatter-mystery">why antimatter is rarer than matter</a>.&nbsp;Sterile neutrinos are also a candidate for <a href="https://journals.aps.org/rmp/abstract/10.1103/RevModPhys.93.035007">dark matter</a>, the unidentified substance that outweighs normal matter in the universe.</p>



<p>The search made for a huge project, but Argüelles finished it in about half of the time typical for U.S. Ph.D.s in the physical sciences. And though they found no signs of the would-be particle, Argüelles ruled out some ideas about what it could be like.</p>

<p>“It was an amazing performance,” says neutrino physicist Francis Halzen, who advised Argüelles’ Ph.D. work at the University of Wisconsin–Madison and is IceCube’s head scientist. “It was a piece of art.”</p>



<p>Argüelles also looks for other possible hidden particles, like WIMPs, a hypothetical particle that could be a form of dark matter. And Argüelles isn’t afraid to pursue research farther from their specialty. Though no expert in quantum computers, for example, Argüelles was <a href="https://journals.aps.org/prresearch/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevResearch.1.033176">the first to use a quantum computer to simulate</a> how neutrinos can change from one type to another. That could one day help scientists better understand neutrino-rich events like supernova explosions.</p>



<p>“I just hate when people tell me I cannot do something,”&nbsp;Argüelles says.</p>



<p>Halzen describes Argüelles as fearless, the kind of scientist who is never afraid to ask questions. “I don’t think they have any regard for their reputation, ever,” he says.</p>

<h4>Backstory</h4>



<p>Argüelles’ attitude toward research is, in part, forged by past struggles to overcome hardship and discrimination.</p>



<p>“There are worse things in life than not being able to solve a problem,” they say.</p>



<p>Growing up in Peru meant building a life on shifting ground. The economy was unstable, and at times Argüelles’ family struggled to make ends meet.</p>



<p>Though Argüelles’ parents were supportive and saw knowledge as a safe investment, they at first rejected Argüelles’ desire to study physics. Argüelles, wiping a tear from their eye, recalls their father saying, “You’re just going to die of hunger.” Soon Argüelles’ parents did embrace the career choice.</p>



<p>Argüelles says Peru, when they were growing up, was also an “extremely negative environment” for LGBTQ+ people. “I’m a gay man,” they say, “and it was very, very, very difficult.”</p>



<p>Same-sex marriages are not recognized in Peru. Hate crimes and discrimination based on sexual orientation were only prohibited in 2017, by a presidential decree that the country’s Congress tried but failed to overturn.</p>



<p>When Argüelles left Peru in 2012 to pursue their Ph.D., they found that studying physics in the United States wasn’t without obstacles. Almost nobody high up in the field looked like them. They struggled under the weight of expectations and felt that voicing their anxieties would get them branded as weak. But with help from mentors, Argüelles persevered.</p>



<p>Now, as an assistant professor at Harvard, Argüelles sees their students — particularly women and Hispanics — facing the same challenges. Argüelles is passionate about supporting them.</p>



<p>“It’s about not giving up, right?” Argüelles says. “I still go through some of these things myself. But I’ll survive it.”</p>

                <div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="alignleft size-thumbnail"><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/sn-10-scientists-to-watch-2022"><img loading="lazy" width="186" height="186" src="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/100822_sn10_bug-186x186.jpg" alt="Icon that reads &quot;The SN 10 Scientists to Watch&quot; and &quot;See the full list of scientists&quot;" class="wp-image-3117446" srcset="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/100822_sn10_bug-186x186.jpg 186w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/100822_sn10_bug-214x214.jpg 214w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/100822_sn10_bug.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 186px) 100vw, 186px" /></a></figure></div>


<p>It’s no revelation that sea levels are rising. Rising temperatures brought on by human-caused climate change are melting ice sheets and expanding ocean water. What’s happening inside Earth will also shape future shorelines. Jacky Austermann is trying to understand those inner dynamics.</p>



<p>A geophysicist at Columbia University’s Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory, Austermann didn’t always know she would end up studying climate. Her fascination with math from a young age coupled with her love of nature and the outdoors — she grew up hiking in the Alps — led her to study physics as an undergraduate, and later geophysics.</p>





<p>As Austermann dug deeper into Earth’s geosystems, she learned just how much the movement of hot rock in the mantle influences life on the surface. “I got really interested in this entire interplay of the solid earth and the oceans and the climate,” she says.</p>



<h4>Big goal</h4>



<p>Much of Austermann’s work focuses on how that interplay influences changes in sea level. The global average sea level has risen more than 20 centimeters since 1880, and the yearly rise is increasing. But shifts in local sea level can vary, with those levels rising or falling along different shorelines, Austermann says, and the solid earth plays a role.</p>



<p>“We think about sea level change generally as ‘ice is melting, so sea level is rising.’ But there’s a lot more nuance to it,” she says. “A lot of sea level change is driven by land motion.”&nbsp;</p>





<p>Understanding that nuance could lead to more accurate climate models for predicting sea level rise in the future. Such work should help inform practical solutions for communities in at-risk coastal areas.</p>



<p>So Austermann is building computer models that reconstruct sea level changes over the last few million years. Her models incorporate data on how the creeping churning of the mantle and other geologic phenomena have altered land and sea elevation, particularly during interglacial periods when Earth’s temperatures were a few degrees higher than they are today.</p>



<h4>Standout research</h4>



<p>Previous studies had suggested that this churning, known as mantle convection, sculpted Earth’s surface millions of years ago. “It pushes the surface up where hot material wells up,” Austermann says. “And it also drags [the surface] down where cold material sinks back into the mantle.”</p>



<p>In 2015, Austermann and colleagues were the first to show that mantle-induced topographic changes <a href="https://pubs.geoscienceworld.org/gsa/geology/article-abstract/43/10/927/131756/The-impact-of-dynamic-topography-change-on?redirectedFrom=fulltext">influenced the melting of Antarctic ice</a> over the last 3 million years. Near the ice sheet’s edges, ice retreated more quickly in areas where the land surface was lower due to convection.</p>



<p>What’s more, mantle convection is affecting land surfaces even on relatively short time scales. Since the last interglacial period, around 130,000 to 115,000 years ago, mantle convection has <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.1700457">warped ancient shorelines</a> by as much as several meters, her team reported in <em>Science Advances</em> in 2017. &nbsp;</p>

<p>The <a href="https://academic.oup.com/gji/article/227/3/1938/6328486?login=true">growing and melting of ice sheets can deform the solid earth too</a>, Austermann says. As land sinks under the weight of accumulating ice, local sea levels rise. And as land uplifts where the ice melts, water falls. This effect, as well as how the ice sheet tugs on the water around it, is shifting local sea levels around the globe today, she says, making it very relevant to coastal areas planning their defenses in the current climate crisis.</p>



<p>Understanding these geologic processes can help improve models of past sea level rise. Austermann’s team is gathering more data from the field, scouring the coasts of Caribbean islands for clues to what areas were once near or below sea level. Such clues include fossilized corals and water ripples etched in stone, as well as tiny chutes in rocks that indicate air bubbles once rose through sand on ancient beaches. The work is “really fun,” Austermann says. “It’s essentially like a scavenger hunt.”</p>



<p>Her efforts put the solid earth at the forefront of the study of sea level changes, says Douglas Wiens, a seismologist at Washington University in St. Louis. Before, “a lot of those factors were kind of ignored.” What’s most remarkable is her ability “to span what we normally consider to be several different disciplines and bring them together to solve the sea level problem,” he says.</p>



<h4>Building community</h4>



<p>Austermann says the most enjoyable part of her job is working with her students and postdocs. More than writing the next big paper, she wants to cultivate a happy, healthy and motivated research group. “It’s really rewarding to see them grow academically, scientifically, come up with their own ideas … and also help each other out.”</p>



<p>Roger Creel, a Ph.D. student in Austermann’s group and the first to join her lab, treasures Austermann’s mentorship. She offers realistic, clear and fluid expectations, gives prompt and thoughtful feedback and meets for regular check-ins, he says. “Sometimes I think of it like water-skiing, and Jacky’s the boat.”</p>



<p>For Oana Dumitru, a postdoc in the group, one aspect of that valued mentorship came in the form of a gentle push to write and submit a grant proposal on her own. “I thought I was not ready for it, but she was like, you’ve got to try,” Dumitru says. </p>



<p>Austermann prioritizes her group’s well-being, which fosters collaboration, Creel and Dumitru say. That sense of inclusion, support and community “is the groundwork for having an environment where great ideas can blossom,” Austermann says.</p>

<figure class="alignleft size-thumbnail"><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/sn-10-scientists-to-watch-2022"><img loading="lazy" width="186" height="186" src="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/100822_sn10_bug-186x186.jpg" alt="Icon that reads &quot;The SN 10 Scientists to Watch&quot; and &quot;See the full list of scientists&quot;" class="wp-image-3117446" srcset="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/100822_sn10_bug-186x186.jpg 186w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/100822_sn10_bug-214x214.jpg 214w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/100822_sn10_bug.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 186px) 100vw, 186px" /></a></figure></div>


<p>Though humans’ nearly hairless bodies stick out like a cowlick among other primates, our nakedness isn’t unique in the world of mammals. Dolphins and whales are naked, says biological anthropologist Tina Lasisi of the University of Southern California in Los Angeles. There are naked mole-rats. “Elephants, depending on how you look at them, are kind of naked,” she says. “But we’re the only weirdos that are naked except for our head.”</p>



<p>Our species traded off much of our body hair for more sweat glands, an evolutionary adaptation that helps us regulate body heat more efficiently. But what about another uniquely human feature? We’re the only animals known to express tightly curled hair, like that seen in many people of African descent. Lasisi wants to know why and how it came to be.</p>





<h4>Backstory</h4>



<p>For decades, traits that have been associated with racial categories, such as skin pigmentation and hair texture, have gone understudied or ignored among anthropologists, Lasisi says. Much of the study of human biological variation was deserted after the post–World War II backlash against eugenics, a racist field birthed from the idea that humankind could be improved if those deemed to have desirable traits were selectively allowed to reproduce. Since then, research on human variation has largely focused instead on traits that are not overtly racialized, such as lactose intolerance and adaptations to high altitudes.</p>



<p>But studying all forms of human variation is crucial to understanding our species’s evolution, Lasisi says. Studying variation in a way that normalizes rather than dampens or paints differences in a bad light is key not only to righting anthropology’s harmful legacy, but also ethical, socially responsible and sound science, she says.</p>





<p>Lasisi discovered biological anthropology as an undergraduate student at the University of Cambridge. As a Black person who spent many of her formative years among white people in the Netherlands, she was always aware of skin color. She vividly remembers learning that human skin pigmentation evolved as an adaptation to ultraviolet radiation — research pioneered by anthropologist Nina Jablonski of Penn State, who would later become Lasisi’s primary adviser. “It’s like a lightbulb went off in my head,” Lasisi says, and it made her wonder, “What else out there can be explained by evolution?”</p>



<p>Her interest in the origins of curly hair grew in part as an effort to understand her own locks. “Research is me-search,” Lasisi says. But when she first began, there wasn’t much science to comb through, and methodologies for measuring hair texture were either unreliable or inefficient.</p>



<h4>Standout research</h4>



<p>As part of her Ph.D. research, Lasisi worked with a team of anthropologists, thermal engineers and physiologists to study how curly hair might have given our bipedal ancestors a leg up in the hot and dry African savanna.</p>



<p>The team placed a variety of wigs made of human hair onto heat-sensing models and measured heat transfer in different environments. In dry settings, curly hair, especially tightly curled hair, protected the scalp from solar radiation while releasing more heat from the head than straight hair. Lasisi speculates that the larger amount of air space within curly hair is what does the trick.</p>



<p>To underpin her efforts and support future hair research, Lasisi <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-021-90409-x">developed an improved and standardized way of measuring hair curvature and cross-sectional shape.</a> The technique involves segmenting, washing and taking pictures of hair strands and then running the images through an open-source computer program that she created.</p>



<p>Measuring these characteristics on a continuous spectrum (much like we do height, for instance), she argues, is a better way of studying hair texture than the long-standing practice of classifying hair into discrete categories, such as straight, wavy or curly. Such discrete categories are not standardized among experts and can become subjective, she says. They also obscure the immense variation that exists, even on a single person’s head, and especially among curly hair.</p>



<div class="wp-block-sciencenews-content-sidebar">
<h3>Cloudy categories</h3>



<p>Hair with similar curvatures can be perceived as straight, wavy or curly, as seen in this figure that compares the self-reported hair texture of 140 people of European and African ancestry with the actual curvature of their hair samples.</p>

<p>Lasisi is doing highly technical work that hasn’t been part of the conversation, says Robin Nelson, a biological anthropologist at Arizona State University in Tempe. “Before Tina, very few people were working on hair texture in the same way.”</p>



<p>Lasisi will bring this experience to the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor as an assistant professor in 2023, where she’ll continue her studies on human variation.</p>



<h4>Reaching out</h4>



<p>Lasisi wants everyone to be included in conversations about what makes humans human. She has appeared on the podcast <em><a href="https://jonathanvanness.com/podcast/hair-variation-whats-her-story-with-dr-tina-lasisi/">Getting Curious with Jonathan Van Ness</a></em> (of <em>Queer Eye</em> fame). She also hosts a PBS digital show on human evolutionary biology called <em><a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLnNZYWyBGJ1FNZ_ZcL_tJyV8li-lQj0ZA">Why Am I Like This?</a></em>, which she helps conceptualize and write.</p>



<p>What’s more, Lasisi has cultivated a community of curious science seekers on Twitter, Instagram and TikTok. Through short-form videos marked by her signature wit and humor, such as her “Melanin March” series or “Darwin’s greatest hits against white supremacy,” Lasisi educates thousands of followers on human variation, how to talk about race and ethnicity from an anthropological perspective, and much more. She even gives prospective anthropologists career tips and behind-the-scenes glimpses of life in academia. Two-way discussions let her learn from her audience, which she calls her “little focus groups.”</p>

<p>Lasisi hopes her research and outreach will inspire and provide a helpful framework for more nuanced discussions about race, ethnicity, ancestry and human diversity — and that her visibility as a Black anthropologist will encourage other people of color to ask questions that are important to them. “I want to put enough information out there in the world, and [have] enough people out there in the world who have a grasp of that information,” she says, “so that we can see human variation for the beautiful, magnificent, complex thing that it is.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/sn-10-scientists-to-watch-2022">Big questions inspire the scientists on this year’s SN 10 list</a></h4>

              
                <p>Inspiration doesn’t play by any set rules. It can come from anywhere and strike when it’s least expected. A first hint of a big idea can hang on in the recesses of the mind and push people ahead in roundabout ways.</p>



<p>Our SN 10: Scientists to Watch list is a brief study in inspiration. For the seventh year, <em>Science News</em> is <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/collections/sn-10-scientists-to-watch">featuring 10 early- and mid-career scientists</a> driven by their curiosity and sense of wonder, and moved to solve some of the world’s biggest problems. Each is making a mark on their chosen field. Inspired by the beauty he saw in a video of a developing embryo during a middle school science class, Marcos Simões-Costa seeks to understand how cells differentiate during development. It was starry skies in Scotland that pushed planetary scientist Robin Wordsworth to study if and how life might survive elsewhere in the cosmos. And for Jacky Austermann, a love of math and the outdoors led her to physics, then the inner Earth — and ultimately climate change.</p>





<p>Each year we seek SN 10 nominations from Nobel laureates, members of the National Academy of Sciences and past SN 10 scientists. This year’s names came from those notable folks, and then some. For the first time, we opened up nominations to other scientists and the wider public, expanding the breadth of our list. It’s led to another impressive crew – many of them also set on inspiring others.</p>



<p>Biological anthropologist Tina Lasisi, who studies the evolution of human variation, hosts a PBS Digital Studios show and is a popular voice on TikTok. She wants to inspire people of color to ask questions important to them. “Research is me-search,” she says. Neutrino physicist Carlos&nbsp;Argüelles-Delgado is passionate about supporting physics students who don’t have role models who look like them. “It’s about not giving up, right?” Argüelles says. Environmental engineer Smruthi Karthikeyan pulled elementary school students into her coronavirus tracking efforts by letting them name the wastewater-collecting robots.</p>



<p>There are a lot of sparks for new ideas in these scientist stories. We hope they will inspire you, too. <em>— Elizabeth Quill</em></p>

<p>Environmental engineer Smruthi Karthikeyan had spent just a couple of days working in her new lab at the University of California, San Diego when the state instituted its first coronavirus lockdown in March 2020.</p>



<p>She’d been brought on as a postdoc by biologist Rob Knight to develop new techniques for studying how microbes in complex ecosystems shape human health and vice versa. The COVID-19 pandemic quickly put a new spin on that mission.<br><br>Soon, the lab pivoted to support the coronavirus response. Infections were outpacing testing capacity in San Diego County, Karthikeyan says. Meanwhile, the university wanted to keep the campus open for its 10,000 students still living on campus and 25,000 workers. There had to be a way to monitor infections without requiring thousands of people to get tested all the time, Karthikeyan and colleagues thought.</p>





<p>Public health researchers had previously tested wastewater for pathogens as a way to spy on the movements of infectious agents in communities. Viruses, bacteria and parasites can show up in stool before people exhibit symptoms, giving clues to a coming outbreak. But no one had implemented such a system to track a respiratory virus before, and never at a scale of tens of thousands of people.<br><br>Karthikeyan was up for the challenge.</p>



<h4>Bold idea</h4>



<p>The wastewater monitoring system that Karthikeyan and colleagues developed and implemented at UC San Diego, reported July 7 in <em>Nature</em>, processes upward of 200 samples per day. Previous methods could process a maximum of eight samples, she says. What’s more, the system has identified <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-022-05049-6">newly spreading coronavirus variants up to two weeks earlier</a> than clinical testing and accurately forecasted the mix of variants infecting students and staff.</p>



<p>That has given school officials more time to take action to keep infection rates low. During the study period from November 2020 to September 2021, the proportion of clinical tests that were positive was less than one percent, Karthikeyan says, dramatically lower than rates in the surrounding area and many other college campuses at the time.</p>

Karthikeyan</span></figcaption></figure></div>


<p>Among the key players in the team’s monitoring system are 131 robots that collect wastewater samples throughout each day from 360 university buildings. Back at the lab, the samples are screened for viral RNA and results are fed into a publicly available <a href="https://returntolearn.ucsd.edu/dashboard/index.html">online dashboard</a> created as part of the project.<br><br>Karthikeyan’s team isn’t the only one <a href="https://ucmerced.maps.arcgis.com/apps/dashboards/c778145ea5bb4daeb58d31afee389082">using human waste to get a jump on COVID-19</a>. But the scale of the monitoring “is a bit unprecedented,” says Ameet Pinto, an environmental engineer at Georgia Tech in Atlanta. During the study period, Karthikeyan and colleagues processed a total of nearly 20,000 samples. “That’s amazing,” he says.</p>



<p>A positive result triggers a campus-wide notification via smartphone app. For dorms, anyone who lives in the building is mandated to get tested for COVID-19, while anyone who may have recently been in the building is strongly encouraged to get tested.</p>



<p>To increase access to tests, the team swapped candy in vending machines for at-home test kits and installed test drop boxes in the buildings. Karthikeyan’s team processes the tests and sends results within a day.</p>



<p>Anyone testing positive for the coronavirus is moved to a designated isolation dorm or instructed to isolate at home if they live off campus. If the coronavirus shows up in the next day’s wastewater test, the building’s remaining occupants will receive a notification to test again.</p>



<p>To figure out which variants are causing infections at the university, Karthikeyan’s team built a freely available computational tool called Freyja. It uses a library of genetic markers to identify the relative abundances of well-known and emerging variants in the wastewater. Freyja detected the emerging delta variant on campus 14 days before clinical tests did, Karthikeyan and colleagues report.</p>



<h4>Growing the effort</h4>



<p>Based on success at the university, San Diego County officials asked the researchers to test a modified version of the <a href="https://searchcovid.info/dashboards/wastewater-surveillance/">system at the Point Loma Wastewater Treatment Plant</a>, which serves more than 2.2 million residents, and at 17 public schools. Elementary school students got to name the robots, dubbing the machines Sir-Poops-a-Lot, Harry Botter and the Rancid Water, and other silly monikers, Karthikeyan said with a chuckle.</p>



<p>On the county level, the system detected the emergence of the omicron variant 11 days before clinical testing, the team reports in the same study in <em>Nature</em>. A detailed analysis of the public school data hasn’t yet been published.</p>



<p>Karthikeyan and colleagues’ methods have been adapted by researchers at the state, national and international levels. For instance, the <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/healthywater/surveillance/wastewater-surveillance/wastewater-surveillance.html">U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention</a> and the <a href="https://www.fda.gov/food/whole-genome-sequencing-wgs-program/wastewater-surveillance-sars-cov-2-variants">Food and Drug Administration use Freyja</a> to track variants in wastewater across the country.</p>



<p>The system is now being used to monitor monkeypox, and the team is working on how it can detect other pathogens that may be spreading unnoticed. That work has the potential to have a huge impact on wastewater epidemiology, Pinto says.</p>



<p>Karthikeyan will launch her own lab at Caltech in 2023, where she plans to adapt these tools for monitoring groundwater. Communities of microbes that live there can serve as sentinels, flagging disturbances from pollution, climate change and more, she says. “My whole thing is to look at a much larger system from a very tiny lens.”</p>

<p>Visitors to the village of Drumnadrochit, on the western shore of Scotland’s murky Loch Ness, come to see the nearby ruins of Urquhart Castle or to chance a glimpse of the elusive Loch Ness Monster. But growing up in Drumnadrochit, planetary scientist Robin Wordsworth says it was the unobscured view of the cosmos that seized his attention. “There are incredibly clear skies up there,” he says.</p>



<p>Today, Wordsworth lives on the other side of the Atlantic. He’s a researcher and professor at Harvard University. But his gaze is still set on the solar system and beyond. From studying how rocky planets may occasionally become encased in glaciers to exploring the sizes of <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/physics-rain-drop-size-limit-alien-planets">alien raindrops</a> or the details of how humans might one day settle Mars, Wordsworth’s scientific explorations vary widely. His research group tends to “do a lot of different things at once,” he says. “If I was to summarize it in a sentence, it would be to understand what drives habitability on planets through time.”</p>





<h4>Standout research</h4>



<p>Wordsworth defines a planet’s habitability as its ability to support life. The idea that life could survive elsewhere in the cosmos has always fascinated Wordsworth, a science fiction fan. Apart from Earth, astronomers have discovered roughly 20 potentially habitable worlds in the universe. With data collected by ground-based observatories, satellites and rovers, he uses supercomputers to construct simulations of planets and the evolution of their climates. Climate is a big focus because it determines whether a planet’s surface can harbor liquid water — a necessity for all known forms of life.&nbsp;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" width="680" height="393" src="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/100822_sn10-wordsworth_inline.jpg" alt="image of orange, white, green and brown clouds swirling in Jupiter's atmosphere" class="wp-image-3117436" srcset="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/100822_sn10-wordsworth_inline.jpg 680w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/100822_sn10-wordsworth_inline-663x383.jpg 663w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/100822_sn10-wordsworth_inline-322x186.jpg 322w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><figcaption><span class="caption wp-caption-3117436">The swirling clouds of Jupiter, captured by NASA’s Juno spacecraft, could release semisolid ammonia slushballs of precipitation.

<p>Wordsworth’s most notable research reconstructs the climate of early Mars. Martian river valleys and other geologic clues suggest that abundant liquid water once flowed across the Red Planet, and the early Martian climate has thus become a hot topic for scientists seeking signs of alien life. But for decades, the best researchers could do was build one-dimensional models that struggled to replicate key atmospheric components, such as clouds.</p>



<p>In 2013 while at the Laboratory of Dynamic Meteorology in Paris, Wordsworth and colleagues presented a <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0019103512004265">3-D model of the early Martian climate</a>, with clouds and an atmosphere containing large amounts of carbon dioxide. Those are key components for studying how the early Martian atmosphere may have reflected and trapped heat, says astrobiologist James Kasting of Penn State.</p>



<p>Wordsworth was the one who figured out how to incorporate clouds into the model, thanks to his strong programming skills, handle over mathematics and determination, Kasting says. “He’s been publishing the best climate calculations for early Mars. There’s really nobody else who is in his lane.”</p>





<h4>What’s next</h4>



<p>Wordsworth’s otherworldly reconstructions may help us better understand whether life might have emerged on Mars or elsewhere. Another strand of his research could help humans one day settle the Red Planet.</p>



<p>Today, most of Mars’ surface is too cold to sustain liquid water, and the planet’s thin atmosphere offers little protection from the sun’s intense ultraviolet radiation. These conditions make it inhospitable to would-be Martian settlers. But in a 2019 study, Wordsworth and colleagues proposed that sheets of insulating silica aerogel deployed over ice-covered areas might make survival possible.</p>



<p>In lab tests, layers of aerogel just centimeters thick <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41550-019-0813-0">filtered out 60 percent of UVA and UVB radiation</a> and almost all of the more dangerous UVC rays, while permitting enough light through for photosynthesis. What’s more, the shields warmed the air underneath by more than 50 degrees Celsius, which could make liquid water and growing crops possible. Looking ahead, Wordsworth plans to investigate how settlers on Mars might use bioplastics or other renewable materials to become self-sustaining.</p>



<p>And far beyond the Red Planet, the exoplanets await. “The <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/james-webb-space-telescope-first-image-nasa">James Webb Space Telescope</a> has just begun to collect new exoplanet data,” Wordsworth says. Observations of their atmospheres will help researchers test ideas about how these distant planets and their climates evolve, he says. “It’s just an incredibly exciting time.”</p>

<p>In January 2020, Caltech biochemist Pamela Bjorkman asked for volunteers to help work out the structures of immune proteins that attack a newly discovered coronavirus. The pathogen had emerged in China and was <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/what-we-know-about-new-virus-causing-pneumonia-outbreak-china">causing severe pneumonia-like symptoms</a> in the people it infected. Knowing the molecular arrangements of these antibodies would be an important step toward developing drugs to fight the virus.</p>



<p>Christopher Barnes, a postdoc working in Bjorkman’s lab on the structure of HIV and the antibodies that target it, jumped at the chance to solve a new puzzle. “I was like, ‘Oh, I&#8217;ll do it!’” Barnes says. At the time he wasn’t aware how urgent the research would become.</p>





<p>Now, we are all too familiar with SARS-CoV-2, which causes COVID-19 and has <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/covid-one-million-death-toll-us-americans-number-mind-psychology">killed more than 6 million people</a> globally. Studies of the structure of the virus and the antibodies that target it have helped scientists quickly develop vaccines and treatments that have <a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/laninf/article/PIIS1473-3099(22)00320-6/fulltext">saved tens of millions of lives</a>. But the virus continues to adapt, making changes to the spike protein that it uses to break into cells. That has left researchers scrambling for new drugs and updated vaccines.</p>



<p>Using high-resolution imaging techniques, Barnes is probing coronavirus spike proteins and the antibodies that attack them. His goal: Find a persistent weak spot and exploit it to create a vaccine that works against all coronaviruses. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<h4>Standout research</h4>



<p>Barnes’ team used cryo-electron microscopy to reveal the structures of eight antibodies that stop the original version of SARS-CoV-2. The technique catches cells, viruses and proteins going about their business by flash freezing them. In this case, the team isolated coronavirus particles entwined with immune system proteins from people with COVID-19.</p>



<p>The antibodies had attached to four spots on the spike protein’s receptor binding domain, or RBD, the team reported in <em>Nature</em> in 2020. This fingerlike region anchors the virus to the cell it will infect. When antibodies bind to the RBD, the virus can no longer connect to the cell. &nbsp;</p>

<p>Barnes’ team also created an antibody classification system based on the RBD location where the immune system proteins tend to latch on. “That’s been really helpful for understanding the types of antibody responses that are elicited by natural infection,” says structural biologist Jason McLellan, who wasn’t involved in the work, and for identifying prime candidates for drug development.</p>



<p>“A major strength of Chris is that he does not limit himself or his research to one technique,” says McLellan, of the University of Texas at Austin. “He quickly adapts and incorporates new technologies to answer important questions in the field.”</p>



<p>Since launching his own lab at Stanford, Barnes and colleagues have determined the structures of six <a href="https://www.cell.com/immunity/fulltext/S1074-7613(22)00174-1#secsectitle0010">antibodies</a> that attack the original SARS-CoV-2 virus and <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/covid-delta-variant-mutations-coronavirus-life-cycle-2021">delta</a> and <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/covid-coronavirus-omicron-variant-mutation-infectious">omicron</a> variants. Those variants are skilled at evading antibodies, including lab-made ones given to patients to treat COVID-19.<br><br>The newly identified antibodies, described in the June 14 <em>Immunity</em>, target the spike protein’s N-terminal domain. The structures of the sites where the proteins attach are the same in delta and omicron, hinting that the sites might remain unchanged even in future variants, the team says. Eventually, scientists may be able to mass-produce antibodies that target these sites for use in new therapies.</p>



<h4>What’s next</h4>



<p>Barnes has now turned his attention to antibodies that can fend off all coronaviruses — from ones that cause the common cold to ones found in livestock and other animals that have the potential to spill over into people.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>



<p>Barnes and immunologist Davide Robbiani of the University of Lugano in Switzerland identified classes of antibodies that target variants from all four coronavirus families, blocking the viruses’ ability to fuse with cells.</p>



<p>What’s more, the structure of one of the binding sites on the spike protein is the same across the coronavirus family tree, Barnes says. “This is something you wouldn’t want to mutate as you diversify your viral family because this is a critical component of how you enter the cell.”</p>



<p>Two independent teams have identified similarly broad action in the same antibody classes. Taken together, the findings suggest that a universal coronavirus vaccine is possible, Barnes says.</p>



<p>“We’ve all kind of discovered this at the same time,” he says. The teams are now thinking, “Wow, this exists. So let’s try to make a real, true pan-coronavirus vaccine.”</p>

<p>When Emily Jacobs embarked on a career studying the brain in the early 2000s, a technique called functional magnetic resonance imaging, or fMRI, was having a moment. “Just like we have super powerful telescopes that can let us quantify the farthest reaches of the known universe, here we have this tool that could allow us to see the entire human brain and as a pulsing, living organ,” says Jacobs, a cognitive neuroscientist at the University of California, Santa Barbara.<br><br>By measuring changes in blood flow that serve as a proxy for brain activity, neuroscientists were getting new views of how different situations spur conversations between brain regions, and how the intensity of the conversations changes over time. “I was riding that wave of excitement,” Jacobs says. </p>



<p>But she soon realized there were big questions that weren’t being asked — questions important to half the world’s population. Do the natural hormonal changes that come with menstruation, pregnancy and menopause affect communication across the brain? What about hormonal contraceptives, such as the birth control pill, which are <a href="https://www.un.org/development/desa/pd/sites/www.un.org.development.desa.pd/files/files/documents/2020/Jan/un_2019_contraceptiveusebymethod_databooklet.pdf">used by hundreds of millions</a> of people globally? And what does it all mean for brain health and behavior?</p>

<h4>Big goal</h4>



<p>The rise and fall of hormones is a big reason women have historically been <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/blog/scicurious/nih-policy-best-way-sex-equality-studies">excluded from biomedical research</a>, even though hormones in men fluctuate too. The resulting gap in knowledge of female biology has led to inadequate <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/postpartum-depression-scientific-research-mothers">mental</a>, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/blog/scicurious/flibanserin-approval-complicated-drug-takes-spotlight">physical</a> and <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/pregnancy-medication-new-drugs-research-clinical-trials">reproductive</a> health care. “Science, and especially neuroscience, has not served the sexes equally,” Jacobs says.</p>





<p>With a range of tools — fMRI, other types of MRI and brain imaging, blood testing, neuropsychological testing, virtual reality and more — Jacobs’ lab is trying to fill in gaps in our basic understanding of how hormones act in the human brain. And she is studying the hormones as a lens for bigger questions about brain changes. </p>



<p>“What’s really special about Emily’s work is that she does it at so many different levels. It’s so multifaceted,” says cognitive neuroscientist Caterina Gratton of Northwestern University in Evanston, Ill. “She has multiple different types of brain measures, from the molecular all the way up to brain systems.”</p>



<h4>Standout research</h4>



<p>In a series of studies dubbed 28 and Me — for the 28 days of a typical menstrual cycle — Jacobs and colleagues closely monitored the brain of one woman for the duration of her natural menstrual cycle. Every 24 hours over 30 days, this 20-something woman’s brain was scanned, blood hormone levels checked and mood assessed.</p>



<p>As the woman’s estrogen levels peaked during ovulation, regions throughout the brain synced up. And regions in an important hub called the default mode network became tight conversationalists. What’s more, one part of this network rearranged itself to create a new and transient communication clique. After ovulation, when estrogen levels dropped and progesterone levels spiked, gray matter temporarily expanded in a brain structure tied to learning and memory.</p>



<p>When the same woman was examined a year later while on the pill, which quells progesterone, the changes weren’t observed. </p>



<p>The findings, described in 2021 in <em>Current Opinion in Behavioral Sciences</em>, provide strong evidence that the <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S235215462100019X?via%3Dihub">ebb and flow of sex hormones</a> drives changes in the brain on a day-to-day basis, Jacobs and colleagues say. They also saw links between hormone fluctuations and brain changes <a href="https://www.biologicalpsychiatryjournal.com/article/S0006-3223(22)01008-3/fulltext">in a male participant</a>.</p>





<h4>What’s next</h4>



<p>The observations led cognitive neuroscientist Caitlin Taylor, a postdoc in Jacobs’ lab, to wonder how the brain responds to chronic hormone suppression from oral contraceptive use. The team is launching <a href="https://jacobs.psych.ucsb.edu/node/121">a large-scale study</a> to attempt to find out.</p>



<p>Initially, Jacobs hesitated to green-light the research. She worried it could be twisted to erode access to contraception. Eventually, she relented, because women “deserve to have science that can serve us,” she says.</p>



<p>Another effort, which Jacobs and Taylor are building, will make data for such large-scale studies widely available. Called the <a href="https://jacobs.psych.ucsb.edu/research/oral-hormonal-contraceptives-and-brain">University of California Women’s Brain Initiative</a>, it aims to funnel records from the university system’s eight brain-imaging research centers into an open-access database. When a woman gets her brain scanned at one of the centers, her de-identified brain-imaging data, medical data and information about hormonal contraceptive use will be entered into the database. Once all eight centers are on board, there could be about 10,000 participants annually — way more than a single lab could recruit.</p>



<p>The expected mountain of data should be a boon to researchers asking big and small questions about brain health, Jacobs says. And she hopes it will improve women’s health care.</p>

<figure class="alignleft size-thumbnail"><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/sn-10-scientists-to-watch-2022"><img loading="lazy" width="186" height="186" src="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/100822_sn10_bug-186x186.jpg" alt="Icon that reads &quot;The SN 10 Scientists to Watch&quot; and &quot;See the full list of scientists&quot;" class="wp-image-3117446" srcset="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/100822_sn10_bug-186x186.jpg 186w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/100822_sn10_bug-214x214.jpg 214w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/100822_sn10_bug.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 186px) 100vw, 186px" /></a></figure></div>


<p>Growing up in Brazil, Marcos Simões-Costa often visited his grandparents’ farm in the Amazon. That immersion in nature — squawking toucans and all — sparked his fascination with science and evolution. But a video of a developing embryo, shown in his middle school science class, cemented his desire to become a developmental biologist.</p>



<p>“It’s such a beautiful process,” he says. “I was always into drawing and art, and it was very visual — the shapes of the embryo changing, the fact that you start with one cell and the complexity is increasing. I just got lost in that video.”</p>





<p>Today, Simões-Costa, of Harvard Medical School and Boston Children’s Hospital, is honoring his younger self by demystifying how the embryo develops. He studies the embryos and stem cells of birds and mice to learn how networks of genes and the elements that control them influence the identity of cells. The work could lead to new treatments for various diseases, including cancer.</p>



<p>“The embryo is our best teacher,” he says.</p>





<h4>Standout research</h4>



<p>Simões-Costa focuses on the embryo’s neural crest cells, a population of stem cells that form in the developing central nervous system. The cells migrate to other parts of the embryo and give rise to many different cell types, from the bone cells of the face to muscle cells to brain and nerve cells.</p>



<p>Scientists have wondered for years why, despite being so similar, neural crest cells in the cranial region of the embryo can form bone and cartilage, while those in the trunk region can’t form either. While a postdoc at Caltech, Simões-Costa studied the cascade of molecules that govern how genes are expressed in each cell type. With his adviser, developmental biologist Marianne Bronner, he identified transcription factors — proteins that can turn genes on and off — that were present only in cranial cells. Transplanting the genes for those proteins into trunk cells endowed the cells with the ability to create cartilage and bone.</p>



<p>Now in his own lab, he continues to piece together just how this vast regulatory network influences the specialization of cells. His team reconstructed how neural crest cells’ full set of genetic instructions, or the genome, folds into a compact, 3-D shape. The researchers identified short DNA sequences, called enhancers, that are located in faraway regions of the genome, but end up close to key genes when the genome folds. These enhancers work with transcription factors and other regulatory elements to control gene activity.</p>



<p>Simões-Costa is also using neural crest cells to elucidate a strange behavior shared by cancer cells and some embryonic cells. These cells produce energy anaerobically, without oxygen, even when oxygen is present. Called the Warburg effect, this metabolic process has been studied extensively in cancer cells, but its function remained unclear.</p>

<p>Through experiments manipulating the metabolism of neural crest cells, Simões-Costa’s team found that the Warburg effect is necessary for the cells to move around during early development. The mechanism, which should stay turned off in nonembryonic cells, somehow “gets reactivated in adult cells in the context of cancer, leading those cells to become more migratory and more invasive,” Simões-Costa says.</p>



<p>“He’s one of the few people who’s really looked at [this process in neural crest cells] at a molecular level and done a deep dive into the mechanisms underlying it,” says Bronner.</p>



<p>Cleverly combining classical embryological methods with the latest genomic technologies to address fundamental questions in developmental biology is what makes Simões-Costa special, says Kelly Liu, a developmental biologist at Cornell University. He wants to understand not only what individual genes do, but how they work at a systems level, she says.</p>



<h4>What’s next</h4>



<p>How does the genetic blueprint tell cells where they are in the embryo, and what they should be doing? How do cancer cells hijack the Warburg effect, and could understanding of that process lead to new treatments? These are some of the questions Simões-Costa wants to tackle next.</p>



<p>“It’s been 20 years since the Human Genome Project came to a conclusion,” he says, referring to the massive effort to <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/human-genome-project-dna-genetics-revolution-green">read the human genetic instruction book</a>. “But there’s still so much mystery in the genetic code.”</p>



<p>Those mysteries, plus a deep passion for lab work, fuel Simões-Costa’s research. “Being at the bench is when I’m the happiest,” he says. He likens the delicate craft of performing precise surgeries on tissues and cells to meditation. “It does not get old.”</p>

<p>A long-sought “holy grail” in cryptography is poised to change the way we protect sensitive information.</p>



<p>Today’s standard encryption schemes take an all-or-nothing approach. Once scrambled, your data become inaccessible to anyone without the secret key.</p>



<p>This has allowed for secure e-mail communication, the proliferation of online transactions and digital signatures. It allows tax and medical records with sensitive personal information to be passed more safely across the internet. But if you give someone the secret key to access any of the data, all of the data become vulnerable.</p>





<p>What if instead you could assign specific people access to do very specific things with your data? Someone could get the information they need (the info you want them to have) without unlocking all of the original data. Bank details, credit card numbers, account passwords – all would remain hidden. That wholly different approach could also allow Netflix to make show recommendations without seeing your full viewing history, for example. Google could sort your e-mails without knowing what’s in them. And medical researchers could analyze data to identify risk factors for a disease without accessing any individual’s health information.</p>



<p>This and other cryptographic wonders now appear possible through a master tool called indistinguishability obfuscation.</p>



<p>“It’s a new tool – a very powerful tool,” says cryptographer Huijia (Rachel) Lin of the University of Washington in Seattle who <a href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2020/1003">showed with colleagues in 2020 how to construct the tool.</a> “Once you have this superstrong power, then a lot of the other tasks are either special cases of it, or you can easily use this to realize [those tasks].”</p>



<p>Vinod Vaikuntanathan, a computer scientist at MIT who has worked with Lin on previous research, compares indistinguishability obfuscation, or iO, to a grand theory in physics that would unite gravity and quantum mechanics. “iO gives you a way to do a grand unification of cryptography in the sense that you can explain much of what cryptography does in a very simple way.”</p>





<h4>Standout research</h4>



<p>Indistinguishability obfuscation is a form of program obfuscation, an approach that seeks to hide the inner workings of a computer program, not just the message or data itself. Though proposed in 1976 <a href="https://ee.stanford.edu/~hellman/publications/24.pdf">in a paper that set the foundation for modern cryptography</a>, program obfuscation proved difficult to achieve. For many years, people thought it might not be possible.</p>



<p>And in 2001, researchers showed that complete program obfuscation — called black-box obfuscation, in which input and output data are known but nothing else about a program can be discovered — is impossible. Yet indistinguishability obfuscation, proposed at the same time and shown to be incredibly powerful, doesn’t demand that <em>everything</em> about a program remain hidden. It instead deals with two programs that perform the same function. If the inner workings of those two programs can be hidden enough that the two can’t be distinguished from each other, indistinguishability obfuscation has been achieved. By hiding the secret key within the program itself, iO enables the delegation of specific data and data tasks to specific people.</p>



<p>Still, proposal after proposal for making iO work proved breakable. Researchers couldn’t figure out how to keep it safe from an adversary’s attacks. Lin says the approaches being used didn’t appeal to her. Researchers were leaning on what appeared to be “good enough” ways of getting at the problem that weren’t backed by rigorous mathematical proofs.</p>



<p>Lin instead wanted to break the problem down so she could understand each component and how they worked together. She wanted to approach the problem like a clock, with gears and nuts and bolts, instead of tangled like “a bowl of spaghetti.”</p>



<p>Through this strategy, Lin, along with Amit Sahai of UCLA and Aayush Jain, a Ph.D. student at UCLA at the time, demonstrated that iO is achievable. It would be secure based on standard assumptions in the field, the team proved, renewing hope in the tool.</p>



<p>“Of course, [Huijia] is brilliant,” Vaikuntanathan says, adding that her persistence is what really sets her apart. “It takes some guts to continue with an approach when essentially all the rest of the world thinks that it is not going to work.”</p>



<h4>Backstory</h4>



<p>Lin says she didn’t grow up with computers or fall in love with computer programming at an early age. As a student, she was interested in physics and strived to be good at everything. She started with computer science in college; a class in cryptography as a Ph.D. student at Cornell University “was really mind-opening,” she says. Her introduction to what are known as <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOGdb1CTu5c">zero-knowledge proofs</a> stands out in her memory.</p>



<p>A zero-knowledge proof says that a person can convince someone else that they know a secret without revealing the secret or any details about it. Say, for example, you knew that a number was the product of two prime numbers. Can you convince someone that fact is true without revealing what the primes are? How to prove that such a task is possible fascinated Lin. &nbsp;</p>

</div><figcaption>Computer scientist Amit Sahai of UCLA explains the cryptography concept of zero-knowledge proof at five different levels.</figcaption></figure>



<p>Cryptography includes a lot of these seeming paradoxes that prove to be possible. Indistinguishability obfuscation is yet another example – and Lin works on others, including secure multiparty computation, which allows a computer task to run across multiple people’s data without any person having to reveal their data to anyone in the group, or to a third party.</p>



<p>“I’m very attracted to these magical concepts,” Lin says. “The fun of it is to make this concept come to realization.”</p>



<p>Indistinguishability obfuscation is still far from real-world implementation. But Vaikuntanathan says it’s not unusual for first constructions of what will become important approaches to be impractical at first. “Wait for a decade,” he says.</p>

<p>Josep Cornella doesn’t deal in absolutes. While chemists typically draw rigid lines between organic and inorganic chemistry, Cornella, a researcher at Max-Planck-Institut für Kohlenforschung in Mülheim an der Ruhr, Germany, believes in just the opposite.</p>



<p>“You have to be open to cross boundaries,” he says, “and learn from it.” The fringes are “where the rich new things are.”</p>



<p>Cornella is an organic chemist by industry standards; he synthesizes molecules that contain carbon. But he’s put together a team from a wide range of backgrounds: inorganic chemists, physical organic chemists, computational chemists. Together, the team brainstorms novel approaches to designing new catalysts, so that chemical reactions essential to pharmaceuticals and agriculture can be made more efficient and friendly for the environment. Along the way, Cornella has unlocked mysteries that stumped chemists for years.</p>





<p>“He has told us about catalysts … that we didn’t have before, and which were just pipe dreams,” says Hosea Nelson, a chemist at Caltech who has not worked with Cornella.&nbsp;</p>





<h4>Bold idea</h4>



<p>When Cornella heard a speaker at a 2014 conference say that bismuth was nontoxic, he was sure it was a mistake. Bismuth is <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/despite-lack-free-electrons-bismuth-superconducts">a heavy metal that sits between toxic lead and polonium on the periodic table</a>. But it is indeed relatively nontoxic — it’s even used in the over-the-counter nausea medicine Pepto-Bismol.</p>



<p>Still, bismuth remains poorly understood. That’s one reason it attracted him. “It was a rather forgotten element of the periodic table,” Cornella says. But, “it’s there for a reason.”</p>



<p>Cornella started wondering if an element like bismuth could be trained for use as a catalyst. For the last century, scientists have been using transition metals, like palladium and iron, as the main catalysts in industrial synthesis. “Could we actually train [bismuth] to do what these guys do so well?” he asked. It was a conceptual question that “was completely naïve, or maybe stupid.”</p>



<p>Far from stupid: His team successfully used bismuth as a catalyst to make a carbon-fluorine bond. And bismuth didn’t just mimic a transition metal’s role — it worked better. Only a small amount of bismuth was required, much less than the amount of transition metal needed to complete the same task.</p>



<p>“A lot of people, including myself and other [researchers] around the world, have spent a lot of time thinking about how to make bismuth reactions catalytic,” Nelson says. “He’s the guy who cracked that nut.”</p>



<h4>Standout research</h4>



<p>While the bismuth research is “weird” and “exciting,” Cornella says, it remains a proof of concept. Bismuth, though cheap, is not as abundant as he had hoped, so it’s not a very sustainable option for industry.</p>



<p>But other Cornella team findings are already being used in the real world. In 2019, the group figured out how to make an alternative to Ni(COD)<sub>2</sub>, a finicky catalyst commonly used by chemists in the lab. If it’s not kept at freezing temperatures and protected from oxygen by a layer of inert gases, the nickel complex falls apart.</p>



<p>The alternative complex, developed by Lukas Nattmann, a Ph.D. student in Cornella’s lab at the time, <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41929-019-0392-6">stays stable in oxygen at room temperature</a>. It’s a game changer: It saves energy and materials, and it’s universal. “You can basically take all those reactions that were developed for 60 years of Ni(COD)<sub>2</sub> and basically replace all of them with our catalyst, and it works just fine,” Cornella says.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-pullquote alignright"><blockquote><p>“A lot of people … have spent a lot of time thinking about how to make bismuth reactions catalytic. He&#8217;s the guy who cracked that nut.”</p><cite>Hosea Nelson</cite></blockquote></figure>



<p>Cornella’s lab is also developing new reagents, substances that transform one material into another. The researchers are looking to transform atoms in functional groups — specific groupings of atoms that behave in specific ways regardless of the molecules they are found in — into other atoms in a single step. Doing these reactions in one step could cut preparation time from two weeks to a day, which would be very useful in the pharmaceutical industry</p>



<h4>Taking risks</h4>



<p>It’s the success that gets attention, but failure is “our daily basis,” Cornella says. “It’s a lot of failure.” As a student, when he couldn’t get a reaction to work, he’d set up a simple reaction called a TBS protection —&nbsp;the kind of reaction that’s impossible to get wrong —&nbsp;to remind himself that he wasn’t “completely useless.”</p>



<p>Today he runs a lab that champions taking risks. He encourages students to learn from one another about areas they know nothing about. For instance, a pure organic chemist could come into Cornella’s lab and leave with a good understanding of organometallic chemistry after spending long days working alongside a colleague who is an expert in that area.</p>



<p>To Cornella, this sharing of knowledge is crucial. “If you tackle a problem from just one unique perspective,” he says, “maybe you’re missing some stuff.”</p>



<p>While Cornella might not like absolutes, Phil Baran, who advised Cornella during his postdoctoral work at Scripps Research in San Diego, sees Cornella as fitting into one of two distinct categories:&nbsp;“There are chemists who do chemistry in order to eat, like it’s a job. And there are chemists who eat in order to do chemistry,” Baran says. Cornella fits into the latter group. “It’s his oxygen.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/robotic-pill-mucus-gut-deliver-medicine">This robotic pill clears mucus from the gut to deliver meds</a></h4>

              
                <p>A mucus-wicking robotic pill may offer a new way to deliver meds.</p>



<p>The multivitamin-sized device houses a motor and a cargo hold for drugs, including ones that are typically given via injections or intravenously, such as insulin and some antibiotics. If people could take such drugs orally, they could potentially avoid daily shots or a hospital stay, which would be “a huge game changer,” says MIT biomedical engineer Shriya Srinivasan.</p>



<p>But drugs that enter the body via the mouth face a tough journey. They encounter churning stomach acid, raging digestive enzymes and sticky slicks of mucus in the gut. Intestinal mucus “sort of acts like Jell-O,” Srinivasan says. The goo can trap drug particles, preventing them from entering the bloodstream.</p>





<p>The new device, dubbed RoboCap, whisks away this problem. The pill uses surface grooves, studs and torpedo-inspired fins to scrub away intestinal mucus like a miniature brush whirling inside a bottle. In experiments in pigs, <a href="http://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/scirobotics.abp9066">RoboCap tunneled through mucus lining the walls of the small intestine</a>, depositing insulin or the IV antibiotic vancomycin along the way, Srinivasan and colleagues report September 28 in <em>Science Robotics.</em> After churning for about 35 minutes, the pill continued its trip through the gut and eventually out of the body.</p>



<p>RoboCap is the latest pill-like gadget made to be swallowed.&nbsp; In 2019, some of the same researchers who developed RoboCap debuted a different device­ — one that <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/pills-needles-injection-medication">injects drugs by pricking the inside of the stomach</a> (<em>SN: 2/7/19</em>). That pea-sized injector was not designed to work in the small intestine, where some drugs are most easily absorbed. The RoboCap may also be able to deliver larger drug payloads, Srinivasan says.&nbsp;</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/pandemic-young-adults-personality-development">The pandemic may be stunting young adults’ personality development</a></h4>

              
                <p>The psychological development of young adults may have taken a hit, thanks to the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>



<p>In typical times, people tend to become more conscientious and agreeable and less neurotic with age, a process known as psychological maturation. But in the United States, the pandemic seems to have <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0274542">reversed that personality trajectory</a>, especially among adults under 30, researchers report September 28 in <em>PLOS ONE</em>. If those patterns persist, that could spell long-term trouble for this cohort, the researchers say.</p>





<p>“You get better as you go through life at being responsible, at coping with emotions and getting along with others,” says personality psychologist Rodica Damian of the University of Houston, who was not involved with this study. “The fact that in these young adults you see the opposite pattern does show stunted development.”</p>



<aside class="wp-block-sciencenews-inline-related-post alignleft"><h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/sign-up-for-e-mail-updates-on-the-coronavirus-outbreak">Sign up for e-mail updates on the latest coronavirus news and research</a></h4></aside>



<p>Personalities shape how people think, feel and behave. Researchers often assess a person’s personality profile along five core traits: neuroticism, conscientiousness, agreeableness, extraversion and <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/good-life-happy-meaning-richness-change-experiences-psychology">openness to experience</a> (<em>SN: 9/1/21</em>). Over time, these traits change slightly in individuals; neuroticism tends to decrease, for example, while agreeableness typically improves.</p>



<p>The pandemic, though, may be upending those typical trend lines. Even after factoring out expected changes, researchers in the new study observed about a decade’s worth of personality change, averaged across all study participants, in just three years — but going in the opposite of the expected direction. Young adults showed the greatest change in certain traits. Middle-aged adults — 30 to 64 years old — showed more change across all traits. The personalities of older adults, meanwhile, stayed largely unchanged.</p>



<p>Such age differences make intuitive sense to personality psychologist Wiebke Bleidorn of the University of Zurich. “The density of experiences in adolescence and young adulthood is so much higher” than in later life, says Bleidorn, who was not involved with the study. “If you miss out on your senior year of high school, you can’t get that back.”</p>





<p>To look at personality change in the United States before and during the pandemic, personality psychologist Angelina Sutin and colleagues analyzed data from the <a href="https://uasdata.usc.edu/index.php">Understanding America Study</a>.</p>



<p>This survey looks at how attitudes and behaviors in the country change in response to major events, such as the 2020 presidential election and the ongoing pandemic. Among those surveyed, roughly 7,000 people — ranging in age from 18 to 109 — took a personality inventory at least once in the six years prior to the pandemic and once during the pandemic. &nbsp;</p>



<p>Based on those responses, neuroticism overall in the United States dropped slightly in 2020, during the first year of the pandemic. That finding mirrors what the researchers found with a different dataset two years ago, when they reported that neuroticism <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0237056">declined in adults during the first six weeks of the pandemic</a>. But the new findings include data from 2021 and 2022, which show that the dip was fleeting.</p>



<p>That initial dip was probably due to the sense of solidarity that emerged in the health crisis’s earlier months, along with people attributing their worries to the crisis rather than their own internal state, says Sutin, of Florida State University in Tallahassee. “In the second year, all that support fell apart.”</p>



<aside class="wp-block-sciencenews-inline-related-post alignleft">
<h4>
<a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/editors-picks/2019-novel-coronavirus-outbreak">See all our coverage of the coronavirus outbreak</a>
</h4>
</aside>



<p>Average neuroticism scores have since rebounded to pre-pandemic levels. But the picture is nuanced, the researchers found. The 2020 dip was driven almost entirely by middle-aged participants and older adults. For those two groups, neuroticism scores continued to fall over the following years, albeit more slowly than before the pandemic. Neuroticism scores among young adults in 2021 and beyond, however, surpassed pre-pandemic levels. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Similarly, conscientiousness and agreeableness scores also declined among middle-aged adults in 2021 and early 2022, but the drop wasn’t nearly as steep as the one observed among young adults.</p>



<p>The findings are troubling, Sutin says. “We know these traits predict all sorts of long-term outcomes.”</p>



<p>For instance, high neuroticism links to mental health issues, such as anxiety, depression and feelings of loneliness. And low conscientiousness is linked to poor educational, work, health and relationship outcomes.</p>



<p>Still, whether these personality changes persist remains to be seen. It could be that young adults “missed the train” during a critical development period, Damian says. Maybe they would have gotten a college degree or pursued a more lucrative career without the pandemic. Or maybe these people can still reach their designated stop, just behind schedule.</p>



<p>“There are critical developmental periods and then there is plasticity,” Damian says. “We don’t know how it’s going to play out.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/fish-fossils-china-jaws-vertebrates">Ancient fish fossils highlight the strangeness of our vertebrate ancestors</a></h4>

              
                <p>My, what small teeth they had.</p>



<p>A newfound treasure trove of ancient fish fossils unearthed in southern China is opening a window into the earliest history of jawed vertebrates — a group that encompasses 99 percent of all living vertebrates on Earth, including humans. The fossil site, dated from 439 million to 436 million years ago, includes a revealing variety of never-before-seen small, toothy, bony fish species.</p>



<p>The diversity of the fossils at this one site not only <a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-022-05136-8">fills a glaring gap</a> in the fossil record, but also highlights the strangeness that such a gap exists, researchers report in the Sept. 29 <em>Nature</em>.</p>





<p>&#8220;These discoveries confirm what we’ve been arguing for&#8221; for years, based on smaller bits of fossils, says Michael Coates, a paleobiologist at the University of Chicago who was not involved in the research.</p>



<p>Genetic analyses had previously pointed to this time period, known as the early Silurian Period, as an era of rapid diversification of jawed vertebrates. But the toothy fishes seemed to have left few traces in the fossil record. Instead, as far as the fossil record was concerned, jawless fishes appeared to rule the waves at the time. And what jawed fishes have been preserved were rarely bony; most have been chondrichthyans, ancient cartilaginous ancestors of modern sharks and rays.</p>



<p>The Chongqing Lagerstätte — paleontologists’ word for a rich assemblage of diverse species all preserved together at one site — “fundamentally changes that picture,” write paleontologist You-an Zhu of the Chinese Academy of Sciences in Beijing and colleagues in the study. The site is teeming with toothy, bony fishes, particularly armored placoderms, but bears just one chondrichthyan.</p>

<p>The first creatures to <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/first-vertebrates-earth-arose-shallow-coastal-waters">develop a backbone</a> were fish, and they did it around 480 million years ago (<em>SN: 10/25/18</em>). Genetic analyses have suggested that by about 450 million years ago, those fish also developed jaws, the better to chomp each other with. But the earliest complete fossils of such jawed fish appear relatively late in the fossil record, about 425 million years ago. By the Devonian Period, which spanned from 419 million to 359 million years ago, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/devonian-swimming-revolution-oceans-may-have-never-happened">jawed fishes were a global phenomenon</a>, earning that era the nickname “Age of Fishes” (<em>SN: 7/17/18</em>).  </p>



<p>The discovery also hints that the ancestor of both types of jawed fishes, bony and<br>cartilaginous, could have arisen earlier than thought, Coates says. It’s possible that the last common ancestor of modern jawed vertebrates appeared <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/asteroid-barrage-ancient-marine-life-boom-not-linked" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">during the Great Ordovician Biodiversification Event</a>, which began around 471 million years ago (<em>SN: 1/24/17</em>). To date, scientists have found only three varieties of fish body fossils dating to that time period, all jawless, finless and &#8220;vaguely resembling a super-sized armor-plated tadpole,&#8221; Coates<br>adds.</p>



<p>Here’s a closer look at a few of the newly discovered fishy denizens of the Chongqing Lagerstätte.</p>



<h4>Little but fierce</h4>



<p>About 20 separate specimens of a little fish that the researchers have called <em>Xiushanosteus mirabilis</em> were found at the Chongqing site. Those finds make the animal the most abundant type of fish in that fossil assemblage.</p>



<p><em>X. mirabilis</em> was only about 30 millimeters long, about the length of a paper clip, but it bears a strong resemblance to larger armored placoderms to come in the future: It had a broad, bony head shield and a body covered in small, diamond-shaped scales.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" width="680" height="383" src="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/092722_cg_fish-fossils_inline2.jpg" alt="illustration of Xiushanosteus mirabilis" class="wp-image-3117816" srcset="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/092722_cg_fish-fossils_inline2.jpg 680w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/092722_cg_fish-fossils_inline2-330x186.jpg 330w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><figcaption><span class="caption wp-caption-3117816">The head-to-tail preservation of fossils of <em>Xiushanosteus mirabilis</em> (shown in an artist’s rendition) has allowed researchers to reconstruct the fish’s anatomy in detail.</span><span class="credit wp-credit-3117816">Heming Zhang</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>The surprising abundance of this type of fish at a site from the early Silurian Period might just be due to lucky fossilization conditions — the small, delicate bones of <em>X. mirabilis</em> and the other jawed fishes found at Chongqing would be harder to preserve than the larger jawless specimens of the time, or the more robust toothy bony fishes of the later Devonian Period. But another possibility is that this site is an outlier in its time that just happened to be popular with the placoderms.</p>



<h4>A heavily armored, diminutive shark</h4>



<p>Two types of jawed fish arose around 450 million years ago — and both make an appearance at the Chongqing site. The new site is remarkable for its diversity of osteichthyans, bony jawed fishes like <em>X. mirabilis</em>. But cartilaginous <em>Shenacanthus vermiformis</em> also spent some time in this environment.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" width="680" height="383" src="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/092722_cg_fish-fossils_inline3.jpg" alt="reconstruction of Shenacanthus vermiformis" class="wp-image-3117817" srcset="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/092722_cg_fish-fossils_inline3.jpg 680w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/092722_cg_fish-fossils_inline3-330x186.jpg 330w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><figcaption><span class="caption wp-caption-3117817"><em>Shenacanthus vermiformis </em>(shown in this reconstruction) was a tiny, but armored cartilaginous fish found alongside its bony neighbors at the new Chinese fossil site.</span><span class="credit wp-credit-3117817">Heming Zhang</span></figcaption></figure>



<p><em>S. vermiformis </em>is represented by only a single specimen at Chongqing, but like <em>X. mirabilis</em>, it is excellently preserved from head to tail. It was diminutive too, just 22 millimeters long. Though it had a similar body plan to other chondrichthyans, it did differ in one key way: Like <em>X. mirabilis</em>, <em>S. vermiformis</em> was heavily armored, with extensive plates on its underside and back.</p>



<h4>A time of transition</h4>



<p>The Chinese site isn’t just shedding light on ancient jawed fish — it offers a window into the evolutionary transition of body features from jawless to jawed species. One newly discovered jawless creature, dubbed <em>Tujiaaspis vividus</em>, turns out to be closely related to <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-022-04897-6">a group of jawed fishes called galeaspids</a>, researchers report in a separate paper in the same issue of <em>Nature</em>.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" width="1440" height="810" src="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/092722_cg_fish-fossils_inline4.jpg" alt="reconstruction of Tujiaaspis vividus" class="wp-image-3117815" srcset="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/092722_cg_fish-fossils_inline4.jpg 1440w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/092722_cg_fish-fossils_inline4-680x383.jpg 680w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/092722_cg_fish-fossils_inline4-800x450.jpg 800w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/092722_cg_fish-fossils_inline4-330x186.jpg 330w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/092722_cg_fish-fossils_inline4-768x432.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/092722_cg_fish-fossils_inline4-1030x580.jpg 1030w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/092722_cg_fish-fossils_inline4-1380x776.jpg 1380w" sizes="(max-width: 1440px) 100vw, 1440px" /><figcaption><span class="caption wp-caption-3117815">The excellent preservation of the jawless fish&nbsp;<em>Tujiaaspis vividus </em>(shown in this reconstruction)<em>&nbsp;</em>is offering new insights into the evolution of fins in its later jawed cousins.</span><span class="credit wp-credit-3117815">Heming Zhang</span></figcaption></figure>



<p>The well-preserved fossils of <em>T. vividus</em> open up new opportunities to learn how its jawed relatives acquired their arrangements of fins, <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-022-02973-5">a transition for which there has been little previous evidence</a>, writes Matt Friedman, a paleontologist at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor, in a commentary in the same issue of <em>Nature</em>. That’s because galeaspids have distinctive head shields, but scientists haven’t previously been able to peer beneath these fossilized shields to study the hidden anatomy.</p>



<p>Thanks to these close relatives, the researchers pieced together how paired fins in the jawless fish evolved in stages to become separate pectoral and pelvic fins in their jawed cousins. Such fins are the precursors of arms and legs <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/first-tetrapods-may-have-emerged-salty-estuaries">in later tetrapods</a> (<em>SN: 5/30/18</em>).</p>

<p>Acceleration of human impact on the environment and biodiversity loss, are two mutually reinforcing issues. Commonly considered as pests, rodents are the largest group of mammals in the world; and yet, their crucial role in the maintenance of the ecosystem they inhabit is largely underappreciated. Due to their large abundance and wide distribution, rodent population can be a beneficial indicator of ecosystem function.</p>
<p>Research conducted by researchers from the Chinese Academy of Sciences published in <em>BMC Ecology and Evolution,</em> have monitored 115 rodent populations in China with durations ranging from 20 to 33 years. Nearly half of the populations studied (54 of 115), are in decline. The authors demonstrated that accelerated climate warming and human disturbance might be the driving factor of this sustained decline in rodent species. Strikingly, in high-latitude regions which experienced more climate warning, and in habitats with intensified human disturbance such as cities and farmlands, these sustained decline are more pronounced.</p>
<p>These findings may provide relief to pest management programs in rodent-infested regions; however, as a keystone species in many ecosystems, the decline in rodent species may be a signal of an ecosystem transition or dysfunction.</p>

<h4 class="c-article-title" data-test="article-title"><em>BMC Microbiology</em> &#8211; <a href="https://bmcmicrobiol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12866-022-02614-x">Modeled microgravity alters apoptotic gene expression and caspase activity in the squid-vibrio symbiosis</a></h4>
<p>The venture into space, although exciting, can be a life threatening expedition for many life forms. One of the aspects of spaceflight, microgravity, is the condition in which objects or people appear to be weightless. Responsible for its vital role in evolution of life forms on earth, gravity or lack thereof can result in long-term, physiological disturbances to space explorers.</p>
<p>In this study published in <em>BMC Microbiology</em>, researchers at the University of Florida explored the effects of microgravity on developmental processes influenced by microbes. By looking at the effects of simulated microgravity and beneficial association between the bobtail squid, <em>Euprymna scolopes </em>and the gram-negative bacterium, <em>Vibrio fischeri, </em>the researchers reported that spaceflight might cause disturbance to the normal apoptotic pathways in animals. The mechanisms of communication used by <em>E. scolopes </em>and <em>V. fischeri </em>are present in other animals and thus these findings may shine a light on how spaceflight may alter normal physiological responses.</p>
<p>With the acceleration in the number of space explorations, understanding the impact of microgravity is crucial for maintaining long-term health of space explorers. This study demonstrates that mutualistic animal-microbe interactions have significant implications upon spaceflight-induced physiological changes on life forms, and that maintenance of a healthy microbiome during long-duration spaceflights, is essential.</p>

<img class="wp-image-13006 size-medium alignright" src="https://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2022/09/AdobeStock_503553861-2-300x200.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200" srcset="https://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2022/09/AdobeStock_503553861-2-300x200.jpg 300w, https://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2022/09/AdobeStock_503553861-2-768x512.jpg 768w, https://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2022/09/AdobeStock_503553861-2-640x427.jpg 640w, https://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2022/09/AdobeStock_503553861-2.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />
<p>Originating from the Latin word &#8216;<em>plagiarius&#8217;</em> which translates to &#8216;kidnapper&#8217;, plagiarism is a fundamental breach of ethics and research integrity. Coupled with the blurred definition of plagiarism, culture and education also plays a role in people’s perceptions and understanding of plagiarism. Integrity is one of the foundations of scientific research, thus, differences in perceptions of plagiarism may have larger implications for the scientific community.</p>
<p>In an effort to better understand the differences in perceptions of plagiarism across Europe, researchers from Southeast University, and KU Leuven conducted a survey aimed at biomedical researchers about their perception on plagiarism. Despite responders agreeing on the universally obvious examples of plagiarism, such as copying text from someone else’s publication without crediting the source; there appears to be differences in perceptions on less straightforward examples such as copying text from someone else’s publication and crediting the source without quotation marks. Compared to southern and northwestern European researchers, Nordic researchers scored higher sensitivity to plagiarism-related/like examples. The researchers argue that policy and research training across Europe might play a factor in these differences.</p>
<p>Establishing a clear-cut definition on what constitutes plagiarism, can benefit the scientific community and foster better collaboration. These findings also emphasises the importance in synchronising approaches and training surrounding research integrity across different regions.</p>

<p>To ensure blood banks are equipped with adequate blood supply, improving donor retention is crucial. Among other factors such as discovering an illness and fear of needles, fainting is an important factor that discourages blood donors from returning. Being the most common adverse events during, or after blood donations, vasovagal reactions often affect young-first time donors.</p>
<p>Recent study published in <em>BMC Medical Informatics and Decision Making, </em>employed seven machine-learning algorithms to investigate factors associated with adverse incidents during blood donation. Suessner and co-authors observed 1,715 fainting reactions in 228,846 blood donations from 88,003 donors over a 2-year study period. They reported that their machine-learning algorithms had high potentials of predicting fainting reactions during blood donations, which may prove to be beneficial for detecting high-risk donors. Compared to height, weight and gender, their machine learning prediction model found that systolic and diastolic blood pressure, ambient conditions, humidity and barometric pressure are essentially the most important predictors for fainting reactions.</p>
<p>Alleviating barriers that contribute to reduced retention rates for further donations is essential. This study demonstrates that employing predictive machine-learning algorithms can be beneficial in reducing adverse reactions during blood donation, and thereby, improving donor retention rates.</p>

<p>Lack of trust in research, accelerated by low reproducibility, abundant research waste, and spread of misinformation can jeopardise advancement in the field of biomedical research. The QUEST Centre for Responsible Research, operating within the Berlin Institute of Health, aims to develop and facilitate change in the culture and practice of research and enhance transparent, reproducible research practices.</p>
<p>In this commentary published in <em>BMC Research Notes, </em>members of the QUEST Centre shared their experiences based on challenges and opportunities that they have encountered and learned, over their first five years. The authors report that, improvement in research practise does not constitute a singular endpoint, but rather a constant communication and adaptation. It is important that, in championing reproducibility, organisations should remain open minded to novel approaches. There is not one-size-fits-all approach in the fight towards a more reproducible science. The authors identified that stakeholder engagement, identifying important incentives, effective communication, united bottom-up and top-down approaches, support of key decision makers, employment of expertise and support of decision-makers are a few of the factors that can lead to advancement in reproducible research.</p>
<p>In the continued fight towards reproducible science, we can learn from experiences of members at The QUEST Centre, on how we can further improve, and advocate, for increased reproducibility in research.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/false-teeth-hearing-aids-jaw-bone-sound">False teeth could double as hearing aids</a></h4>

              
                <p>Prosthetic teeth could make great hearing aids.</p>



<p>Vibrations applied to replacements for lost teeth <a href="https://asa.scitation.org/doi/full/10.1121/10.0013898">travel well through jawbones to the inner ear</a>, researchers report in the September <em>Journal of the Acoustical Society of America</em>. The finding could lead to discreet alternatives to <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/artificial-hearing-has-come-long-way-1960s">conventional hearing aids and cochlear implants</a> that people with hearing impairments often use (<em>SN: 7/7/16</em>).</p>



<p>Previous tooth-based hearing aids designs clipped onto molars and received sound wirelessly from a microphone placed behind the ear. Dental researcher Jianxiang Tao and colleagues want to take the concept a step further, turning tooth implants into hearing aids. The electronics that impart sound vibrations would be built into the portion of a false tooth anchored into the jawbone, says Tao, of Tongji University in Shanghai.</p>





<p>But first, the team had to determine how well dental implants transmit sound compared with natural teeth and the mastoid bone behind the ear, which other types of hearing aids rely on to work. So the researchers applied sound tones to the implants, natural teeth and mastoid bones of 38 people with hearing loss and a single dental implant. For a wide range of frequencies, the volunteers could hear sounds through implants as well as, or better than, through natural teeth or mastoid bones, the team reports.</p>



<p>Front-tooth implants appeared to work slightly better than dental implants toward the back of the jaw. That may be because jawbone at the front of the mouth is harder than jawbone at the back, the team speculates. Lower teeth and implants worked as well as uppers for transmitting sound.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Compared with traditional hearing aids, dental implant hearing aids could offer “excellent concealment, good comfort and improved quality of sound,” the researchers write.</p>

<p><a href="https://bookshop.org/a/21798/9781982173357">Fen, Bog &amp; Swamp</a><br><em>Annie Proulx</em><br><em>Simon &amp; Schuster, $26.99</em></p>



<p>A recent TV ad features three guys lost in the woods, debating whether they should’ve taken a turn at a pond, which one guy argues is a marsh. “Let’s not pretend you know what a marsh is,” the other snaps. “Could be a bog,” offers the third.</p>



<p>It’s an exchange that probably wouldn’t surprise novelist Annie Proulx. While the various types of peatlands — wetlands rich in partially decayed material called peat — do blend together, I can’t help but think, after reading her latest book, that a historical distaste and underappreciation of wetlands in Western society has led to the average person’s confusion over basic peatland vocabulary.</p>





<p>In<em> Fen, Bog &amp; Swamp: A Short History of Peatland Destruction and Its Role in the Climate Crisis</em>, Proulx seeks to fill the gaps. She details three types of peatland: fens, which are fed by streams and rivers; bogs, fed by rainwater; and swamps, distinguishable by their trees and shrubs. While all three ecosystems are found around most of the world, Proulx focuses primarily on northwestern Europe and North America, where the last few centuries of modern agriculture led to a huge demand for dry land. Wet, muddy and smelly, wetlands were a nightmare for farmers and would-be developers. Since the 1600s, U.S. settlers have drained more than half of the country’s wetlands; just 1&nbsp;percent of British fens remains today.</p>





<p>Only recently have the consequences of these losses become clear. “We are now in the embarrassing position of having to relearn the importance of these strange places,” Proulx writes. For one, peatlands have great ecological value, supporting a variety of wildlife. They also <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/bogs-peatlands-fire-climate-change">sequester huge amounts of carbon dioxide</a>, and some peatlands prevent shoreline erosion, while buffering land from storm surges (<em>SN: 3/17/18, p. 20</em>). But the book doesn’t spend too much time on nitty-gritty ecology. Instead, Proulx investigates these environments in the context of their relationship with people.</p>



<p>Known for her fiction, Proulx, who penned <em>The Shipping News</em> and “Brokeback Mountain,” draws on historical accounts, literature and archaeological digs to imagine places lost to time. She challenges the notion that wetlands are purely unpleasant or disturbing — think Shrek’s swamp, where only an ogre would want to live, or the Swamps of Sadness in <em>The Neverending Story </em>that swallow up Atreyu’s horse.</p>



<p>Proulx jumps back as far as 20,000 years ago to the bottom of the North Sea, which at the time was a hilly swath called Doggerland. When sea levels rose in the seventh century B.C., people there learned to thrive on the region’s developing fens, hunting for fish and eels. In Ireland, “bog bodies” — many thought to be human sacrifices — have been preserved in the peat for thousands of years; Proulx imagines torchlit ceremonies where people were offered to the mud, a connection to the natural world that is hard for many people to comprehend today. These spaces were integrated into the local cultures, from Renaissance paintings of wetlands to British lingo such as <em>didder</em> (the way a bog quivers when stepped on). Proulx also reflects on her own childhood memories — wandering through wetlands in Connecticut, a swamp in Vermont — and describes how she, like writer Henry David Thoreau, finds beauty in these places. “It is … possible to love a swamp,” she says.</p>



<p>Fens, bogs and swamps are technically distinct, but they’re also fluid; one wetland may transition into another depending on its water source. This same fluidity is reflected in the book, where Proulx flits from one wetland to another, from one part of the world to another, from one millennium to another. At times didactic and meandering, Proulx will veer off to discuss humankind’s destructive tendency not just in wetlands, but nature in general, broadly rehashing aspects of the climate crisis that most readers interested in the environment are probably already familiar with. I was most enthralled — and heartbroken — by the stories I had never heard before: of “Yde Girl,” a redheaded teenager sacrificed to a bog; the zombie fires in Arctic peatlands that burn underground; and the ivory-billed woodpecker, a bird missing from southern U.S. swamps for almost a century.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/saba-caribbean-island-species-conservation">A Caribbean island gets everyone involved in protecting beloved species</a></h4>

              
                <p class="has-drop-cap" style="font-size:20px">The coral reef, once bustling with more than 5,000 long-spined sea urchins, became a ghost town in a matter of days. White skeletons with dangling spines dotted the reef near the Dutch Caribbean island of Saba, the water cloudy from the disintegrating corpses. In just a week last April, half of the urchins, <em>Diadema antillarum</em>, in a section of reef called “Diadema City” had died. In June, only 100 remained.</p>



<p>The mysterious die-off started sweeping across the Caribbean in February. It’s eerily similar to a mass mortality event in 1983 that wiped out as much as 99 percent of the Caribbean <em>Diadema</em> population — a huge blow to not only the urchins, which have not fully recovered four decades later, but also the reefs. Without urchins grazing, algae can overwhelm a reef, damaging adult coral and leaving nowhere for new coral to settle.</p>





<p>Before the die-off, Saba’s coral cover — the part of a reef that consists of live hard coral rather than sponges, algae or other organisms — hovered around 50 percent. Today, that number is down to 3 percent.</p>



<p>“It’s just downhill, downhill, downhill,” says Alwin Hylkema, a marine ecologist at Van Hall Larenstein University of Applied Sciences and Wageningen University in the Netherlands who is based in Saba (pronounced “say-bah”).</p>



<p>I learned about Saba’s sea urchin problem only shortly after I learned that the island existed. Saba is a blip in the Caribbean; at 13 square kilometers, it’s about a quarter the size of Manhattan, with the towering Mount Scenery volcano at its center. Its reefs attract scuba divers, but a lack of beaches shields it from regular Caribbean tourist traffic — hence its nickname, “the unspoiled queen.” What the island lacks in size and sand it makes up for with its great variety of species, its biodiversity. Steep cliffs support several micro­climates. In just a few hours, a visitor can hike from volcanic rock to grassy field to misty cloud forest.</p>



<p>This diversity makes Saba the perfect spot for Sea &amp; Learn, an annual educational program that brings scientists from around the world to the island. Former dive shop owner Lynn Costenaro launched the program in 2003 to encourage more divers to visit Saba during the off-season. But the event has grown to play an important role in educating the island’s 2,000 residents about their home’s unique wildlife and ecosystems.</p>



<p>Throughout October, the scientists present their research on everything from biology and geology to astronomy at restaurants and in plazas. Several researchers also host public research trips underwater and on shore, so attendees can see the lobsters, or rock formations or stars for themselves.</p>

<p>This kind of local engagement with the environment comes at a time when many species are at risk, and not just on Saba, says Severin Irl, an island ecologist at Goethe University Frankfurt in Germany. Although islands cover only about 7 percent of the world’s landmass, they are home to an estimated 20 percent of all species — and 75 percent of all documented extinctions.</p>



<p>Some island species occupy only one island; others are spread out in small populations across several islands. Species within small populations can develop a very narrow, island-specific set of adaptations, which spells trouble when humans and invasive species arrive. Today, any given plant or animal on an island is <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2351989421003978#fig0025">12 times as likely to go extinct as species on the mainland</a>, Irl and an international group of researchers reported in the November 2021 <em>Global Ecology and Conservation</em>. And the decline is speeding up at an unprecedented rate. As biodiversity decreases, islands lose the complexity that helps keep the ecosystem stable and less vulnerable to disruptions, such as climate change.</p>



<p>“We’re in the midst of a biodiversity crisis … and islands are really bearing the brunt of that global change,” says arachnologist Lauren Esposito of the California Academy of Sciences, who has <a href="https://www.seaandlearn.org/lauren-esposito">presented research</a> on spiders and scorpions at Sea &amp; Learn.</p>



<p>The features that put island inhabitants at risk — their small size and isolation — also make them wonderful laboratories. Like the famous Galápagos Islands that turned Charles Darwin on to natural selection, islands present opportunities to study individual species as well as ecosystem dynamics, in a relatively small microcosm. In 2021, the California Academy of Sciences launched Islands 2030, co-led by Esposito, in five tropical archipelagos, including the Lesser Antilles where Saba is located. The aim is to conduct biodiversity research as well as train local communities to become guardians of their environments. The program took its inaugural trip to Saba’s Sea &amp; Learn last October.</p>



<p>I attended that Sea &amp; Learn and tagged along on field trips to see what progress and pitfalls researchers had experienced while working on Saba to protect a tiny orchid, a bright-billed bird and those dying urchins.</p>



<h4>Counting orchids</h4>



<p>On my first night, I joined locals and tourists at the Brigadoon restaurant to hear Mike Bechtold talk about Saba’s orchids. Bechtold, a retired nuclear arms expert from Virginia who fell in love with orchids while serving in Korea, first traveled to the island in 2003 to study the flowers. He’s since presented several times at Sea &amp; Learn. This was his first time back in seven years.</p>



<p>After defining an orchid as a flowering plant with three petals and a laundry list of unusual attributes, Bechtold <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LIGqOKm_jNI">described the disorganized history of orchid research on Saba</a>, including a series of miscommunications that has resulted in count discrepancies. A recently published book identifies 22 species, while Bechtold counts 32.</p>



<p>“To know what we have to preserve, well, we at least have to know what is there,” says Michiel Boeken, a former secondary school teacher from the Netherlands who studied orchids on Saba during his 2010 to 2012 tenure as principal of the island’s only secondary school.</p>



<p>The morning after his presentation, Bechtold led a hike to Spring Bay to look for orchids. We walked along the island’s only major road — aptly named The Road. At the trailhead, we descended into a swath of trees laden with mosses and other plants. We’d only walked for about 10 minutes when Bechtold pointed out an <em>Epidendrum ciliare</em>, the most common orchid on Saba, perched on a tree.</p>

BOEKEN</span></figcaption></figure></div>


<p>Stepping carefully over hermit crabs, we looked for the pile of rocks that marked where to leave the trail to find another species, <em>Brassavola cucullata</em>. Bechtold, Boeken and colleagues had surveyed the Spring Bay population from 2011 to 2014 to see if Saba’s numbers were declining. As we lowered ourselves down the steep hillside, we eventually spied the tiny white and yellow flowers of <em>B. cucullata</em> atop a tall tree with a metal tag glued beneath it; it was #582 of 834 <em>B. cucullata </em>plants that Bechtold helped tag a decade earlier.</p>



<p>We counted the plant’s leaves and measured them. Bechtold’s team had found that larger plants with more leaves had a better chance of survival than smaller plants, as did plants that were higher off the ground, like #582. Plants close to the ground were often munched on by wild goats.</p>



<p>The orchid is found from Mexico to northern South America. But here, <a href="https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/epdf/10.1086/709399">the <em>B. cucullata</em> population was indeed declining</a>, with small plants dying and not many new plants starting to grow, the researchers reported in 2020 in the <em>International Journal of Plant Sciences</em>. Without counting flowers for many more years, if not decades, it will be hard to know if the decline reflects natural population dynamics or if it’s a troublesome trend.</p>



<p>Regardless of cause, the population’s small size makes the island’s<em> B. cucullata </em>vulnerable. A recent hurricane knocked over several trumpet trees hosting large orchid plants. Some of the plants were crushed; others, lowered to the ground when their tree toppled, faced death by goat chomping.</p>



<h4>Tracking red-billed tropicbirds</h4>



<p>A week after the orchid hike, I found myself perched on a boulder high up on a cliff at Tent Bay on the island’s southern coast, looking for nests tucked into narrow rock crevices. German ecologist Lara Mielke, another volunteer and I started out at dawn to beat the heat, climbing hand over foot up the exposed hill. Overhead, red-billed tropicbirds, with long white tails and bright crimson beaks, swooped out across the sea.</p>



<p>About 1,500 breeding pairs of <em>Phaethon aethereus mesonauta</em>, one of the three subspecies of red-billed tropicbirds, breed on Saba, as much as a quarter of the subspecies’s global population. Tropic­birds spend most of their lives at sea, only coming to land for a few months each year to breed and raise a single chick. Their cliffside nesting spot makes the birds hard to study even when they’re on land. Fortunately, on Saba and the neighboring island Saint Eustatius, or “Statia,” the terrain is tough but not impossible to scale.</p>

<p>While climbing, I was startled by an abrasive squawk coming from a deep crevice hiding a nest. But the birds are more squawk than bite, and Mielke was able to reach her arm into the small opening and extract the bird to wrap a band around its leg.</p>



<p>Tameness, helpful when it comes to banding, makes these birds vulnerable to invasive predators. Tropicbird chicks are often eaten by feral cats that roam the island’s cliffs. Over the years, the Saba Conservation Foundation has set up cat eradication programs with mixed success.</p>



<p>After banding the bird, Mielke handed me a warm egg she’d pulled from the nest. I held it in my palm as she filled a plastic bin with water. An egg’s buoyancy indicates how far along it is. We knew, though, that once the chick hatched, it probably wouldn’t live long. In past years, researchers have observed the disappearance of every chick at Tent Bay, presumably snatched by the feral cats.</p>



<p>Chicks have much better odds on the other side of the island. In 2011 and 2012, Boeken — involved in several conservation efforts on Saba — <a href="https://bioone.org/journals/ardea/volume-104/issue-3/arde.v104i3.a8/Breeding-Success-of-Red-Billed-Tropicbirds-iPhaethon-aethereus-i-on/10.5253/arde.v104i3.a8.short">found that 62 of 83 hatchlings, or 75 percent</a>, at Old Booby Hill near Spring Bay to the north survived to fledge the nest. And on Statia, which has no cat problem, as many as 90 percent of chicks survive after they’ve hatched. Though, for reasons still unknown, <a href="https://bioone.org/journals/ardea/volume-107/issue-3/arde.v107i3.a2/----Custom-HTML----Reproductive/10.5253/arde.v107i3.a2.short">their colonies produce much fewer chicks </a>because many eggs simply never hatch.</p>



<p>Tropicbirds are faithful to both their mate and nest site, sometimes even returning to the same rock cavity each year, says ecologist Hannah Madden of the Caribbean Netherlands Science Institute, who moved from the Netherlands to Statia in 2006 and has spearheaded Statia and Saba’s tropicbird research. But the birds may be loyal to a fault. If a nest is repeatedly robbed or eggs fail to hatch, the chances of successfully raising chicks may be increased by relocating or finding a new mate.</p>

<p>Madden and Mielke, working as an independent researcher, are now analyzing GPS data of the subspecies’s foraging patterns. The last Caribbean-wide assessment of seabirds <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/E-Schreiber-2/publication/272791650_West_Indian_Seabirds_a_Disappearing_Natural_Resource/links/5ea2fa5492851c87d1b13492/West-Indian-Seabirds-a-Disappearing-Natural-Resource.pdf#page=37">happened over two decades ago</a>, so Madden has been hosting webinars to teach people on other islands how to collect such data during next year’s nesting season.</p>



<p>“In 2023, we want people from as many islands as possible in the Caribbean to get out there and monitor the seabirds on their islands,” she says.</p>

<h4>Hitting home</h4>



<p>Peter Johnson, an 11th-generation Saba resident, teaches math and physics at the secondary school. Sometimes after class he sits outside the school and listens to the red-billed tropicbirds flying overhead.</p>



<p>“Their birdcall is so unique,” he says. “They’re certainly something that reminds me of home.”</p>



<p>Johnson was a kid when Sea &amp; Learn started in 2003. He still remembers when, in the fifth grade, scientists came to his classroom and let him try on a spelunking helmet used for cave exploration. Years later, he returned to Saba after earning degrees in engineering in Virginia. “You’re more inclined to be proud of where you’re from, the more you know about it,” he says.</p>



<p>Esposito, of the Islands 2030 initiative, recalls being impressed by the fluency of Saban youth when talking about nature. Sea &amp; Learn scientists visit Saba’s schools to teach about the island’s unique species. When Esposito asks students if they’ve seen the island’s local snake — its only snake, the red-bellied racer — they usually say yes. She doesn’t get the same answer on Statia or neighboring islands.</p>



<p>“I have seen the direct effect of Sea &amp; Learn,” she says. “There is this connection between the people coming to do research and the local population and communities that doesn’t exist in most other places.”</p>



<p>Sea &amp; Learn coordinator Emily Malsack hopes the program encourages locals to stay on Saba to work in conservation. It’s already having an impact. Johnson is now the president of the Saba Conservation Foundation. Saban native Dahlia Hassell-Knijff got a degree in biology in Mississippi, then returned to the island, where she oversees projects at the regional Dutch Caribbean Nature Alliance. She also grew up attending Sea &amp; Learn.</p>



<p>“It was a very tiny organization [at the time], but it didn’t seem tiny to me,” Hassell-Knijff says. “It was like a dream come true for a little kid.”</p>

<p>Hassell-Knijff’s story is “an indication of progress that’s to come,” Esposito says. Islands 2030 plans to recruit early-career scientists from five archipelagoes to attend the California Academy of Sciences in San Francisco, where they can work toward an advanced degree and become part of a network of scientists from their archipelago. The hope is that this next generation will return to their home islands to become leaders in biodiversity science and conservation.</p>



<p>There’s a need for this support. Many researchers who study island biology travel from abroad, spend some time and leave, causing research to sputter and disrupting long-term studies that are crucial to understanding population trends of, say, orchids and tropicbirds. Mielke recently ended her six months on Saba to return to Germany, and after 16 years on Statia, Madden moved back to the Netherlands this summer.</p>



<p>“It’s just tough,” Madden says. “At this point, I don’t know who will take over the projects that I’m working on.” Bechtold, too, worries about who will track the orchids after he and Boeken retire from research and can no longer travel to Saba.</p>



<h4>Saving the urchins</h4>



<p>The night that marine ecologist Alwin Hylkema <a href="https://www.facebook.com/seaandlearn/videos/569244107627656">presented his research about <em>Diadema</em></a>, the plaza was packed with over 100 adults and children. Hylkema has become something of a local celebrity. At first, he conducted his urchin research from the Netherlands, visiting Saba twice a year, until he realized it made more sense to do his studies on site. He moved his family to Saba in 2019.</p>



<p>Since then, Hylkema has worked on restoring <em>Diadema</em> to the reefs around Saba. But it’s a challenge: After urchin larvae settle onto a reef, they are easily eaten by queen triggerfish and spiny lobsters. To help more of the animals survive to adulthood, Hylkema’s team has been collecting the youngsters, known as settlers, and growing them in a lab on Saba. Once the animals are a few centimeters wide and less likely to become a meal, the team returns them to the reefs.</p>



<p>In October 2021, things were starting to look up for the animals. That same week, <a href="https://www.saba-news.com/great-news-for-coral-reef-restoration-first-diadema-sea-urchins-cultured-on-saba/">Hylkema’s team bred <em>Diadema</em> in captivity for the first time in Caribbean history</a>.</p>



<p>The lab-grown urchin success came just in time. Hylkema anticipates producing 1,000 to 2,000 juveniles by the end of this year, which he hopes to use for restocking the devastated population at Diadema City. But that will have to wait until whatever is causing the die-off dissipates. Researchers at Cornell University are analyzing <em>Diadema</em> tissue sent by Hylkema and others to try to determine the cause, likely a pathogen.</p>

<p>One afternoon, I hitchhiked south from the town of Windwardside in the middle of the island to the harbor in Fort Bay, where Hylkema’s lab is located. I wanted to see the captive-bred <em>Diadema</em>. The crates in the lab were organized by urchin size: The youngest ones looked like inch-long pom-poms; older urchins resembled plums covered in long, black sewing needles.</p>



<p>In an air-conditioned storage container out back, specks of urchin larvae swirled in glass jars on a vibrating metal plate. After 50 or so days, the larvae will settle and eventually be transferred to the crates. If all goes well, the animals will grow in the lab until they’re big enough to be taken out to the reefs, where they’ll begin the next generation of <em>Diadema</em>.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/nasa-dart-asteroid-dimorphos-impact">NASA’s DART spacecraft just smashed into an asteroid — on purpose</a></h4>

              
                <p>Mission control rooms rarely celebrate crash landings. But the collision of NASA’s DART spacecraft with an asteroid was a smashing success.</p>



<p>At about 7:15 p.m. EDT on September 26, the spacecraft hurtled into Dimorphos, an asteroid moonlet orbiting a larger space rock named Didymos. The mission’s goal was to bump Dimorphos slightly closer to its parent asteroid, shortening its 12-hour orbit around Didymos by several minutes.</p>



<p>The <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/asteroid-moon-name-nasa-course-deflection-mission">Double Asteroid Redirection Test</a>, or DART, is the world’s first attempt to change an asteroid’s motion by ramming a space probe into it (<em>SN: 6/30/20</em>). Neither Dimorphos nor Didymos poses a threat to Earth. But seeing how well DART’s maneuver worked will reveal how easy it is to tamper with an asteroid’s trajectory — a strategy that could protect the planet if a large asteroid is ever discovered on a collision course with Earth.</p>



<p>“We don’t know of any large asteroids that would be considered a threat to Earth that are coming any time in the next century,” says DART team member Angela Stickle, a planetary scientist at the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory in Laurel, Md. “The reason that we are doing something like DART is because there are asteroids that we haven’t discovered yet.”</p>

<p>Astronomers have spotted almost all the kilometer-size asteroids in the solar system that could end civilization if they hit Earth, says Jessica Sunshine, a planetary scientist at the University of Maryland in College Park who’s also on the DART team. But when it comes to space rocks around 150 meters wide, like Dimorphos, “we only know where about 40 percent of those are,” Sunshine says. “And that is something that, if it did hit, would certainly take out a city.”</p>



<p>Dimorphos is a safe asteroid to give an experimental nudge, says Mark Boslough, a physicist at Los Alamos National Laboratory in New Mexico who has studied planetary protection but is not involved in DART. “It’s not on a collision course” with Earth, he says, and DART “can’t hit it hard enough to put it on a collision course.” The DART spacecraft weighs only as much as a couple of vending machines, whereas Dimorphos is thought to be nearly as hefty as Egypt’s Great Pyramid of Giza.</p>



<p>After a 10-month voyage, DART met up with Didymos and Dimorphos near their closest approach to Earth, about 11 million kilometers away. Up until the very end of its journey, DART could see only the larger asteroid, Didymos. But about an hour before impact, DART spotted Dimorphos in its field of view. Using its onboard camera, the spacecraft steered itself toward the asteroid moonlet and slammed into it at some 6.1 kilometers per second, or nearly 14,000 miles per hour.</p>

<p>DART’s camera feed went dark after impact. But another probe nearby caught the collision on camera. The Light Italian CubeSat for Imaging of Asteroids rode to Dimorphos aboard DART but detached a couple of weeks before impact to watch the event from a safe distance. Its mission was to whiz past Dimorphos about three minutes after DART’s impact to snap pictures of the crash site and the resulting plume of asteroid debris launched into space. The probe&#8217;s first images of DART&#8217;s demise were released September 27.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="800" height="450" src="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/092722_mt_dart-impact_inline3-800x450.png" alt="DART mission impact" class="wp-image-3117798" srcset="https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/092722_mt_dart-impact_inline3-800x450.png 800w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/092722_mt_dart-impact_inline3-680x383.png 680w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/092722_mt_dart-impact_inline3-330x186.png 330w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/092722_mt_dart-impact_inline3-768x432.png 768w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/092722_mt_dart-impact_inline3-1030x580.png 1030w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/092722_mt_dart-impact_inline3-1380x776.png 1380w, https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/092722_mt_dart-impact_inline3.png 1404w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /><figcaption>This image, which shows the plume of debris launched by DART&#8217;s collision with Dimorphos, was taken by the Light Italian CubeSat for Imaging of Asteroids from about 57 kilometers away. <br><br>ASI, NASA</figcaption></figure>



<p>“I was absolutely elated, especially as we saw the camera getting closer and just realizing all the science that we’re going to learn,” said Pam Melroy, NASA Deputy Administrator, after the impact. “But the best part was seeing, at the end, that there was no question there was going to be an impact, and to see the team overjoyed with their success.”</p>



<p>DART’s impact is expected to shove Dimorphos into a closer, shorter orbit around Didymos. Telescopes on Earth can clock the timing of that orbit by watching how the amount of light from the double asteroid system changes as Dimorphos passes in front of and behind Didymos.</p>

</div><figcaption>This animation shows how DART&#8217;s impact on Dimorphos will affect the space rock&#8217;s orbit around its larger parent asteroid, Didymos. DART should shove Dimorphos into a slightly tighter, shorter orbit.</figcaption></figure>



<p>“It’s really a beautifully conceived experiment,” Boslough says. In the coming weeks, dozens of telescopes across every continent will watch Dimorphos to see how much DART changed its orbit. The Hubble and James Webb space telescopes may also get images.</p>







<p>“It’ll be really interesting to see what comes out,” says Amy Mainzer, a planetary scientist at the University of Arizona in Tucson who is not involved in DART. “Asteroids have a way of surprising us,” she says, because it’s hard to know a space rock’s precise chemical makeup and internal structure based on observations from Earth. So Dimorphos’ motion post-impact may not exactly match researchers’ expectations.</p>



<p>The DART team will compare data on Dimorphos’ new orbit with their computer simulations to see how close those models were to predicting the asteroid’s actual behavior and tweak them accordingly. “If we can get our models to reproduce what actually happened, then you can use those models to [plan for] other scenarios that might show up in the future” — like the discovery of a real killer asteroid, says DART team member Wendy Caldwell, a mathematician and planetary scientist at Los Alamos National Laboratory.</p>



<p>“No matter what happens,” she says, “we will get information that is valuable to the scientific community and to the planetary defense community.”&nbsp;</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/maya-cacao-ceramics-royals-currency-ritual">In Maya society, cacao use was for everyone, not just royals</a></h4>

              
                <p>In ancient Maya civilization, cacao wasn’t just for the elites.</p>



<p>Traces of the sacred plant <a href="https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2121821119">show up in ceramics</a> from all types of neighborhoods and dwellings in and around a former Maya city, researchers report September 26 in the <em>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences</em>. The finding suggests that, contrary to previous thinking, cacao was consumed at every social level of Maya society.</p>



<p>“Now we know that the rituals the elite depict with cacao were likely played out, like Thanksgiving, like any other ritual, by everyone,” says Anabel Ford, an archaeologist at the University of California, Santa Barbara.</p>





<p>Cacao — which chocolate is made from — was sacred to the ancient Maya, consumed in rituals and used as a currency. The cacao tree (<em>Theobroma cacao</em>) itself was linked to Hun Hunahpu, the maize god. Previous research found cacao in ceremonial vessels and elite burials, suggesting that its use was restricted to those at the top.</p>



<p>To explore the extent to which cacao was used in <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/laser-mapping-shows-surprising-complexity-maya-civilization">broader Maya society</a>, Ford and colleagues examined 54 ceramic shards dating from A.D. 600 to 900 (<em>SN: 9/27/18</em>). The shards come from jars, mixing bowls, serving plates and vases thought to be drinking vessels. All the pieces were found in residential and ceremonial civic areas of varying size and status from city centers, foothills, upland areas and the valley around the former Maya city of El Pilar, on the present-day border of Guatemala and Belize.</p>



<p>To identify cacao, the researchers searched for theophylline, a compound found in trace amounts in the plant. The team found the compound on more than half of the samples, on all types of ceramics and distributed throughout social contexts.</p>



<p>Future research will move beyond who consumed cacao and explore the role of farmers in managing the critical resource. “A better question is to understand who grew it,” Ford says, because those people probably had greater access to the prized commodity.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/mangrove-forest-grow-moon-orbit-lunar-cycle">Mangrove forests expand and contract with a lunar cycle</a></h4>

              
                <p>The glossy leaves and branching roots of mangroves are downright eye-catching, and now a study finds that the moon plays a special role in the vigor of these trees.</p>



<p>Long-term tidal cycles <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.abo6602">set in motion by the moon</a> drive, in large part, the expansion and contraction of mangrove forests in Australia, researchers report in the Sept. 16 <em>Science Advances</em>. This discovery is key to predicting when stands of mangroves, which are good at sequestering carbon and <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/climate-change-natural-carbon-stores-new-map">could help fight climate change</a>, are most likely to proliferate (<em>SN: 11/18/21</em>). Such knowledge could inform efforts to protect and restore the forests.</p>





<p>Mangroves are coastal trees that <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/kenya-mangrove-trees-forest-carbon-storage-climate">provide habitat for fish and buffer against erosion</a> (<em>SN: 9/14/22</em>). But in some places, the forests face a range of threats, including coastal development, pollution and land clearing for agriculture. To get a bird’s-eye view of these forests, Neil Saintilan, an environmental scientist at Macquarie University in Sydney, and his colleagues turned to satellite imagery. Using NASA and U.S. Geological Survey Landsat data from 1987 to 2020, the researchers calculated how the size and density of mangrove forests across Australia changed over time.</p>



<p>After accounting for persistent increases in these trees’ growth — probably due to rising carbon dioxide levels, higher sea levels and increasing air temperatures — Saintilan and his colleagues noticed a curious pattern. Mangrove forests tended to expand and contract in both extent and canopy cover in a predictable manner. “I saw this 18-year oscillation,” Saintilan says.</p>



<p>That regularity got the researchers thinking about the moon. Earth’s nearest celestial neighbor has <a href="https://moon.nasa.gov/moon-in-motion/tides/">long been known to help drive the tides</a>, which deliver water and necessary nutrients to mangroves. A rhythm called the lunar nodal cycle could explain the mangroves’ growth pattern, the team hypothesized.</p>



<p>Over the course of 18.6 years, the plane of the moon’s orbit around Earth slowly tips. When the moon’s orbit is the least tilted relative to our planet’s equator, semidiurnal tides — which consist of two high and two low tides each day — tend to have a larger range. That means that in areas that experience semidiurnal tides, higher high tides and lower low tides are generally more likely. The effect is caused by the angle at which the moon tugs gravitationally on the Earth. &nbsp;</p>



<p>Saintilan and his colleagues found that mangrove forests experiencing semidiurnal tides tended to be larger and denser precisely when higher high tides were expected based on the moon’s orbit. The effect even seemed to outweigh other climatic drivers of mangrove growth, such as El Niño conditions. Other regions with mangroves, such as Vietnam and Indonesia, probably experience the same long-term trends, the team suggests.</p>



<p>Having access to data stretching back decades was key to this discovery, Saintilan says. “We’ve never really picked up before some of these longer-term drivers of vegetation dynamics.”</p>



<p>It’s important to recognize this effect on mangrove populations, says Octavio Aburto-Oropeza, a marine ecologist at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography in La Jolla, Calif., who was not involved in the research.</p>



<p>Scientists now know when some mangroves are particularly likely to flourish and should make an extra effort at those times to promote the growth of these carbon-sequestering trees, Aburto-Oropeza says. That might look like added limitations on human activity nearby that could harm the forests, he says. “We should be more proactive.”&nbsp;</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/olivine-deep-earthquake-mineral-pressure-temperature">Here’s how olivine may trigger deep earthquakes</a></h4>

              
                <p>Cocooned within the bowels of the Earth, one mineral’s metamorphosis into another may trigger some of the deepest earthquakes ever detected.</p>



<p>These cryptic tremors — known as deep-focus earthquakes — are a seismic conundrum. They violently rupture at depths greater than 300 kilometers, where intense temperatures and pressures are thought to force rocks to flow smoothly. Now, experiments suggest that those same hellish conditions might also sometimes transform olivine — the primary mineral in Earth’s mantle — into the mineral wadsleyite. This mineral switch-up can <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-022-32923-8">destabilize the surrounding rock</a>, enabling earthquakes at otherwise impossible depths, mineral physicist Tomohiro Ohuchi and colleagues report September 15 in <em>Nature Communications.</em></p>





<p>“It’s been a real puzzle for many scientists because earthquakes shouldn’t occur deeper than 300 kilometers,” says Ohuchi, of Ehime University in Matsuyama, Japan.</p>



<p>Deep-focus earthquakes usually occur at subduction zones where <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/earth-plate-tectonics-volcanoes-earthquakes-faults">tectonic plates</a> made of oceanic crust — rich in olivine — plunge toward the mantle (<em>SN: 1/13/21</em>). Since the quakes’ seismic waves lose strength during their long ascent to the surface, they aren’t typically dangerous. But that doesn’t mean the quakes aren’t sometimes powerful. In 2013, a magnitude 8.3 deep-focus quake struck around 609 kilometers below the Sea of Okhotsk, just off Russia’s eastern coast.</p>



<p>Past studies hinted that <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/348720a0">unstable olivine crystals could spawn deep quakes</a>. But those studies tested other minerals that were similar in composition to olivine but deform at lower pressures, Ohuchi says, or the experiments didn’t strain samples enough to form faults.</p>



<p>He and his team decided to put olivine itself to the test. To replicate conditions deep underground, the researchers heated and squeezed olivine crystals up to nearly 1100° Celsius and 17 gigapascals. Then the team used a mechanical press to further compress the olivine slowly and monitored the deformation.</p>



<p>From 11 to 17 gigapascals and about 800° to 900° C, the olivine recrystallized into thin layers containing new wadsleyite and smaller olivine grains. The researchers also found tiny faults and recorded bursts of sound waves — indicative of miniature earthquakes. Along subducting tectonic plates, many of these thin layers grow and link to form weak regions in the rock, upon which faults and earthquakes can initiate, the researchers suggest.</p>



<p>“The transformation really wreaks havoc with the [rock’s] mechanical stability,” says geophysicist Pamela Burnley of the University of Nevada, Las Vegas, who was not involved in the research. The findings help confirm that olivine transformations are enabling deep-focus earthquakes, she says.</p>



<p>Next, Ohuchi’s team plans to experiment on olivine at even higher pressures to gain insights into the mineral’s deformation at greater depths.</p>
