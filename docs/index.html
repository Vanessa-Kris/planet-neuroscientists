                <h4><a href="http://brainblogger.com/2017/09/15/environmental-factors-in-development-of-alzheimers-disease/">Environmental Factors in Development of Alzheimer’s Disease</a></h4>

<p>Alzheimer’s disease is one of those conditions where genetics is known to play a profound role but is not the sole factor in disease development and progression. The evidence is mounting that the environment has a great deal to do with the development of this neurodegenerative disorder. Moreover, it is now known that the right kind of nutrition and lifestyle may play preventive role in many cases.</p>
<p>Certain environmental factors, like exposure to toxic chemicals and <a href="http://brainblogger.com/2016/11/09/antidepressant-may-benefit-traumatic-brain-injury/" target="_blank">brain injury</a>, have long been known to increase the risk of Alzheimer’s, dementia, and Parkinsonism. However, the intricacies of this interaction between the environment and genetics is poorly understood. What we know for sure is that the environment does play an important role in the diseases’ development and that certain genes can be predisposing factors.</p>
<p>For instance, a gene called APOE4 is considered to be one of the major risk factors in developing familial <a href="http://brainblogger.com/2017/05/08/hiv-medications-linked-to-increase-in-alzheimers-disease-protein/" target="_blank">Alzheimer’s disease</a>. However, studies have shown the much lower prevalence of Alzheimer’s in sub-Saharan Africans as compared to Africans living in Western societies, where pollution, industrial food, stress, and a sedentary lifestyle render people more susceptible to the disease. There have been very few studies comparing the prevalence of Alzheimer’s among genetically similar populations living in completely different environments. One such study compared the residents of a small Nigerian town with African Americans and found the incidence of Alzheimer’s much higher among those living in the USA.</p>
<p>Let us look at the factors that have been strongly linked with neurodegeneration, dementia, and Alzheimer’s disease.</p>
<p>Acute exposure to and poisoning with <strong>heavy metals and pesticides</strong> has been well studied and documented. However, neurodegeneration occurs due to chronic low-level exposure to these toxic elements. The long term accumulative<a href="http://brainblogger.com/2016/11/06/how-prenatal-lead-exposure-results-in-neurodevelopmental-disorders/" target="_blank">exposure to lead</a> has been shown to cause a decrease in memory and progressive decline in mental functions.  In contrast to lead, the role of aluminium has long been overlooked. This metal is present in many medications (like antacid suspensions). Aluminium is an additive in various commercially available food products, food colorants, and is even used to purify water. There is increasing evidence that it may be playing a role in the development of Alzheimer’s disease.</p>
<p><strong>Air pollution</strong> is something to that many of us are exposed to from a very young age, and in most cases, we do not have much choice. <a href="http://brainblogger.com/2014/09/19/fighting-mental-and-physical-illness-by-reshaping-cities/" target="_blank">Polluted air</a> in large cities contains a toxic cocktail of organic and non-organic compounds, metals, and gases. Evidence of a link between neurodegeneration and air pollution is growing.</p>
<p>Unlike in developing nations, non-infectious diseases are the main health threat in Western societies, and an <a href="http://brainblogger.com/2016/05/21/mindfulness-may-be-the-secret-to-staying-healthy/" target="_blank">unhealthy lifestyle</a> is the main causative factor in the development of serious chronic conditions. Some estimates suggest that <strong>obesity and a sedentary lifestyle</strong> are now killing more people than any other disease. Research data show that the risk of developing Alzheimer’s disease increases by as much as 6-fold in obese people with high blood pressure and high cholesterol level.</p>
<p><strong>Physical activity</strong> decreases the risk of almost any disease, thus having a direct and indirect effect on the <a href="http://brainblogger.com/2016/05/07/can-diet-accelerate-the-development-of-alzheimers-disease/" target="_blank">development of Alzheimer’s</a> as well. Apart from physical exercise, it is also important to stay mentally active. Older people who continue to participate in <strong>mental activities</strong>, such as learning new things, reading, or even listening to music have a lower chance of declines in brain function. Social participation may also help to stay mentally active. Many people tend to become isolated as they grow old. However, maintaining a high level of social activity not only decreases stress and improves mood but may also prevent or delays Alzheimer’s disease and dementia.</p>
<p><strong>Psychological stress</strong> results in an increased level of stress hormones that have been shown to be damaging for brain functionality. Emotional distress like depression and anxiety in young people and middle-aged adults is thought to increase the risk of developing dementia and Alzheimer’s later in life. Some researchers think that emotional distress could be considered an early symptom of neurodegeneration. There is now a wide consensus that emotional distress is a risk factor for dementia and mental decline.</p>
<p><strong>Nutrition</strong> is perhaps the single most important factor that can either prevent or aggregate mental decline. A balanced diet rich in fruits and vegetables is a preventive factor, due to the high content of vitamins, microelements, and antioxidants. Diets with a high saturated fat and <a href="http://brainblogger.com/2017/04/24/targeting-alzheimers-new-unorthodox-approaches/" target="_blank">cholesterol</a> content are harmful, as these fats block blood vessels and are the reason for stroke and cardiac diseases. As the brain is mostly made of fats, it is important to have a balanced diet. Omega-3 has been shown to be neuroprotective, and products like fish oil, soya oil, and walnuts, are a rich source of this compound.</p>
<p>The familial genetic history of neurodegenerative diseases does not necessarily mean that a person will develop mental decline. <a href="http://brainblogger.com/2014/04/24/surprising-role-of-prions-in-neurodegenerative-diseases/" target="_blank">Neurodegenerative diseases</a> are still highly preventable. By avoiding triggers in the environment and living a healthy, active life, one may expect to remain mentally alert until ripe old age.</p>

                <h4><a href="http://blog.ketyov.com/2013/07/the-neuroscience-tenure-track.html">The neuroscience tenure-track</a></h4>

The point of this post is to tell my story and explain, as best I can and in as much detail as possible, my path toward <a href="http://blog.ketyov.com/2013/07/hello-san-diego.html" target="_blank">accepting a tenure-track position at UCSD</a>. I will attempt to give as many factual and quantitative details as possible (where appropriate) for people who might be looking to "compare" in their own job hunt.<br /><br /><i>Brief aside: I'm going to shy away from discussing issues of gender, sex, nationality, class, parenthood, and race because--while I know those factors <a href="http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/the-superhuman-mind/201211/the-academic-gender-bias" target="_blank">play</a> a <a href="http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/news/race-discrimination-in-academia-has-not-improved-over-past-20-years/2003102.article" target="_blank">huge</a> <a href="http://www.insidehighered.com/news/2008/05/23/nokids" target="_blank">role</a> in academia--they're too complex for me to be able to adequately address. However I would like to happily note that the chair of my new home department of Cognitive Science, the chair of the search committee, and the two other computational faculty are all women from a diversity of backgrounds. For those who are curious, I myself am of mixed race from a working class family, but that is as much as I will say on the matter.</i><br /><br />We all know that the academic path is variable and uncertain. When I was on the job hunt I remember looking at other peoples' CVs to see how mine stacked up. I looked at where other post-docs (my competition) published their papers. I looked at their <i>h</i>-indices and grants and conference proceedings. I remember thinking, "what do I have that could possibly make me stand out compared to these amazing scientists"?<br /><br />We encounter this uncertainty repeatedly in academia:<br /><ul><li>Will I pass my qualifying exams?</li><li>Can I come up with a novel hypothesis and run an experiment, from start to finish, to test it properly?</li><li>Do I know enough to do so?</li><li>Can I successfully defend my thesis?</li><li>Find a post-doc?</li><li>Run experiments over and over again?</li><li>Delegate work?</li><li>Get a grant?</li><li>Get a tenure-track job?</li><li>Run a lab?</li></ul><a href="http://blog.ketyov.com/2013/04/why-i-chose-academia.html" target="_blank">Do I even want to keep doing this or just go and make real money?</a> Academia isn't the only job for us. If you don't <i>really</i> want it, you should seriously ask yourself why you're pursuing it.<br /><br />I've struggled at every step along the way. There's been doubt, for sure, but I've talked about all these things in detail on here already and <a href="http://blog.ketyov.com/2011/08/career-advice.html" target="_blank">tried to give advice where possible</a>. I'm also <a href="http://blog.ketyov.com/2013/02/anti-items-in-cvs.html" target="_blank">trying to do my part to mitigate the doubt of future scientists</a> (and this post is yet another attempt at that) while being as honest as possible. That's important to me because I feel like there's a lack of clarity in the academic job process.<br /><br />So let's get to the details (skip to the <i>very</i> end if you just want to compare numbers and CVs).<br /><br />I first tried applying for faculty jobs in Oct/Nov 2010. I applied to psychology jobs at both Stanford and UCLA. This was <i>very</i> early; I'd just finished my PhD but three of my thesis projects were published that that year, one each in <i><a href="http://blog.ketyov.com/2010/11/voytek-neuron-paper-dynamic.html" target="_blank">Neuron</a></i>, <i><a href="http://blog.ketyov.com/2010/10/voytek-pnas-paper-prefrontal-cortex-and.html" target="_blank">PNAS</a></i>, and <i><a href="http://blog.ketyov.com/2010/11/voytek-frontiers-in-human-neuroscience.html" target="_blank">Frontiers in Human Neuroscience</a></i>, each cited (by now) at least 30 times (so they had a decent scientific impact). It was a big year so I thought I'd "dip my toe in the water" and strike while the iron was hot, so to speak.<br /><br />Note that no one--no friends, faculty who wrote my letters of recommendation, etc.--actually thought I'd get a job, but I wanted the practice in applying.<br /><br />(Ah, the academic life before parenthood... I finished writing my job applications on a ferry leaving Kobe, Japan after giving an invited presentation at the International Congress of Clinical Neurophysiology, which was an <i>amazing</i> trip for my wife and I.)<br /><br />In response to this round of applications I got nothing back but form letter rejections around Feb/Mar the following year. But I honestly didn't mind because I had a good post-doc job and I wasn't expecting anything anyway. I really wasn't emotionally invested (by intent).<br /><br />Pause here: I want to note that the applications I sent weren't great. The research statements were weak and I didn't do a good job explicitly stating my overall research theme and goals. This is a skill at which I often fail but one the importance of which I cannot emphasize enough:<br /><br /><i>You know your work better than anyone which makes it easy to forget to be explicit and connect all the dots, but <b>you need to connect those dots and frame your work clearly within the bigger picture</b>.</i><br /><i><br /></i>The committee reading your application won't know your subfield like you do. If you apply to a department that has a broad mission like Cognitive Science--which ranges from computer science to anthropology--you need to make sure you explain your work in a way that everyone can understand and appreciate.<br /><br />Lesson learned.<br /><br />When the 2011 application deadline came around I didn't bother applying for any jobs because I'd just had my first child a few months beforehand. Furthermore I'd just started my current post-doc and I was really excited to get those projects going. I wasn't in a rush.<br /><br />For the 2012 applications (again, Nov/Dec) I decided to make a second tentative attempt. My post-doc grant still had a few more years of funding, but several jobs opened that just "felt right". Stanford had a vision science position that sounded like a good fit, UCLA had an opening in psychology, and UCSD had a position in the Department of Cognitive Science for a computational cognitive scientist doing work in data-mining, BCI, etc.<br /><br />(Can you tell I <i>really</i> wanted to stay in California?)<br /><br />Given that my <a href="http://brainscanr.com/" target="_blank">brainSCANr</a> paper was just published and some of the work I had currently under review were data-mining projects, UCSD seemed like an excellent, rare fit. Again, it was a bit early because none of my post-doc work was published and, again, I wasn't emotionally committed (meaning I was steeled against failure), but I'd have kicked myself if I didn't try. The cost of entry is very low.<br /><br />My applications were much stronger this time. While my CV wasn't phenomenally better, by this point I'd begun running my own mini-lab inside my post-doc lab and I had two <i>really</i> strong papers under review at "good journals" (bleeeeech I hate saying that).<br /><br />In late January I heard that I wasn't short-listed for the UCLA job. Apparently I was "strongly considered", and much-discussed, but in the end they wanted a behavioral neuroscientist (not a cognitive/computational person).<br /><br />As opposed to the first time I tried applying, this time I got personal letters back from faculty on both the UCLA and Stanford committees ("I decided to write you to thank you personally for your application... I am a real fan of the work you are doing...") Honestly I wasn't even upset; those folks seriously know how to make someone feel good about being rejected!<br /><br />As I was sitting at home with my wife the night I got the rejection from UCLA, I received an email from UCSD while I was nursing my wounds (<i>i.e.</i>, watching <i>Game of Thrones</i> or whatever). They asked me if I was still interested in the position to which I had applied.  I re-read that email several times to make sure I wasn't misunderstanding. I had my wife read it, too, to verify. I was pleasantly surprised, to say the least. So I set up a phone meeting with the UCSD cognitive science search committee chair and we arranged a date for me to fly down for my job talk.<br /><br />There were six weeks between that phone call and my interview. Now, I've given a <i>lot</i> of scientific talks, both for large audiences and small, for lay-people and specialists. When I gave my first practice talk at my lab's meeting a few weeks before my job talk, it was <i>okay</i>, but far from great. I made four mistakes that you should avoid:<br /><br /><ol><li>I did a poor job explaining the narrative flow linking one experiment to the next.</li><li>I tried to fit in too much (the "everything plus the kitchen sink" approach). I'm excited about research--my research in particular (hence why I want to stay in academia)--but you have to know which parts to cut. Less really is more.</li><li>I didn't leave people with a strong feeling of the overarching theme of my work...</li><li>Nor did I adequately leave them with a sense of excitement about the future of my work.</li></ol><br />These are hard problems to tackle! But the solution to several of them is essentially: <i>be explicit</i>. The narrative flow is an easy problem to address, because it essentially recapitulates <i>what really happened during the course of your research career</i>. Meaning papers <i>n</i>, and <i>n+1</i> are extensions based off papers <i>n-1</i>, <i>n-2</i>, ...<i>n-i</i>.<br /><br />So <b>talk about them that way</b>.<br /><br />I practiced my talk in front of other people two more times: once with my PhD lab and once for my wife and a friend. I did a final practice run on my own, speaking slowly to make sure I wouldn't go over time.<br /><br /><i>Make sure you do not go over time</i>.<br /><br />Everyone hates that. Don't make everyone hate you because of a dumb issue like amateur time mismanagement. Everyone's time is valuable; don't hold your audience hostage. It's rude.<br /><br />My visit to San Diego was not without some frustrations. My visit was scheduled for Wednesday and Thursday, with my talk being Wednesday at noon. The visit was to begin with an 8am breakfast, followed by meetings with the search committee chair and departmental chair, and then my talk. After the talk there were more meetings, dinner with some faculty, and then another full day of one-on-one meetings with faculty.<br /><br />Unwisely (in hindsight) I decided to fly down late the night before my talk so that I could help my wife with getting our son from daycare, fed, bathed, etc. My flight was scheduled to arrive in San Diego at 10:40pm. I assumed I'd grab a taxi to my hotel near UCSD's campus and be in bed by midnight. No problem.<br /><br />Unfortunately, as we were landing the pilot suddenly kicked the engines into high gear (or whatever the aeronautical equivalent term is) and began to ascend. After circling San Diego's airport for about 30-40 minutes we were informed that, because of dense fog, we were being diverted to Los Angeles. We finally landed at LAX at around 11:30pm, after which time we were to wait around for busses that would then drive us to the San Diego airport.<br /><br />Now I was all carry-on so I was ready to go as soon as we landed. But I did the quick math and, by the time all the other passengers got their luggage, the mob figured out what to do, boarded the busses, and finally got on the road, it would be about 1am. Add a 2-hour drive to the San Diego airport, and then another 30-40 minutes <i>back</i> north to UCSD... that would get me into my hotel room at around 3-4am. I opted out of that arrangement.<br /><br />After calling a few friends in LA to see if I could catch a late-night ride to San Diego (and offer up my hotel room to my generous driver for a night) I was reminded that the following morning (the morning of my job talk) was my good friend's memorial service. A close friend of ours had recently, unexpectedly, died, so <i>all</i> of my closest friends in LA were attending his services (which I had to miss for the job talk... ugh).<br /><br />Thankfully I also <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/alexknapp/2011/10/17/neuroscientist-bradley-voytek-is-bringing-the-silicon-valley-ethos-into-academia/" target="_blank">work for a car company</a> so I requested an Uber to come pick me up. I explained to the the poor guy that came to get me that this wasn't a quick 20 minute ride (long drive, late night, job interview, etc.) I told him I didn't expect him to do such a long trip so late at night in the middle of the week. Amazingly the guy agreed to drive me anyway and was a <i>god damn champ</i>. As I apologized for the bumper-to-bumper 1am Thursday LA traffic he just kept saying, "my job is to get you to your job interview well-rested, so don't worry."<br /><br />By the time I got checked into my hotel it was about 2:00am. I figured I'd get up at 7:30, quick shower and shave, throw on my suit, and meet for breakfast in the lobby at 8am. But whomever stayed in the hotel room before me had different plans, so <i style="font-weight: bold;">surprise</i>! when the alarm in my room went off at 6:15am (I was using my phone's alarm plus a wake up call to wake me up... I hadn't checked the room's alarm clock). Once I figured out how to turn the damn thing off I was <i>awake</i>. Too excited from the cortisol/adrenaline rush to go back to sleep now!<br /><br />So I took my time, got ready, had some coffee, checked my email, and went for a walk around the hotel (which was beautiful, by the way).<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-X84rB0qepJ8/UW4fnrz0XOI/AAAAAAAAFR8/Kx87J-rXyBA/s1600/IMG_1202.JPG" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em; text-align: center;"><img border="0" height="298" src="https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-X84rB0qepJ8/UW4fnrz0XOI/AAAAAAAAFR8/Kx87J-rXyBA/s400/IMG_1202.JPG" width="400" /></a></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><br /></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-wVEPsyTorAE/UW4fn_h47yI/AAAAAAAAFSA/c8X5_1X51kM/s1600/IMG_1204.JPG" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="298" src="https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-wVEPsyTorAE/UW4fn_h47yI/AAAAAAAAFSA/c8X5_1X51kM/s400/IMG_1204.JPG" width="400" /></a></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><br /></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-h2Hbx6VVgtY/UW4fnTG7kVI/AAAAAAAAFSE/OrGp5b9vMg4/s1600/IMG_1201.JPG" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="298" src="https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-h2Hbx6VVgtY/UW4fnTG7kVI/AAAAAAAAFSE/OrGp5b9vMg4/s400/IMG_1201.JPG" width="400" /></a></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><br /></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;">Needless to say I had no problem getting to my 8am breakfast on time. But I was looking at a non-stop 13-hour day of interviews, job talk, meetings, and socializing on about 3-3.5 hours of sleep (and knowing all of my closest friends were grieving for another very close friend).</div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;"><br /></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;">When I first did that simple math I suddenly became very thankful for the last 18 months of parenthood for teaching me how to cope with sleep deprivation.</div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;"><br /></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;">Surprisingly I was so thrilled to be there that I don't really remember feeling overly tired.

You'll note that I'm very text-light in my talks. I know my slides well so I use the figures and images on the pages to prompt me (no written or digital notes). I'm also a one-figure-per-page speaker when I can get away with it.<br /><br /><div style="text-align: center;"> </div><br />If you want to hear me give a <i>very</i> rough version of this talk, here's a video from a talk I did at Berkeley City College about 6 months beforehand:<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"></div><br />As a point of comparison for you bean counters, here's <a href="http://darb.ketyov.com/professional/voytek_cv_tt.pdf" target="_blank">my CV</a>, frozen at the time I got the job offer from UCSD. My <i>h</i>-index was 8. I didn't have any <i>Nature </i>or <i>Science</i> papers (but I did have a <i>PNAS</i> and <i>Neuron</i> paper) nor any fancy grants (no K99, NRSA, etc.)  My most highly-cited primary research paper was an open-access paper published in <i>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience</i>. I also had a few methods papers, including the more... non-standard... <a href="http://brainscanr.com/" target="_blank">brainSCANr</a> paper.<br /><br />The other unusual thing I included was my <a href="http://blog.ketyov.com/2012/10/crowdsourcing-letter-of-recommendation.html" target="_blank">"crowdsourced letter of recommendation"</a> which definitely seemed to have gotten peoples' attention.  My extracurricular activities (<a href="http://ed.ted.com/lessons/diagnosing-a-zombie-brain-and-behavior-tim-verstynen-bradley-voytek" target="_blank">zombie neuroscience</a>, blogging, outreach, etc.) weren't even really mentioned (in the positive or negative) so I'm not sure what the committee thought of all that.<br /><br />There you go.<br /><br />I hope this helps give some idea of what this process is like.  Remember that there really <i>is</i> a lot of luck involved. The departments need to be looking for someone who fills a niche they're lacking. While you can't control your academic fate because of this "luck" factor, you can do a few things to tip the balance in your favor: <br /><ol><li>(Obviously) do good science in a field you love.</li><li>Network and get your name out there: speak at conferences, run symposia, reach out to faculty at universities when you're traveling to see if you can give a department colloquium or lab meeting. But I think <i>physical</i> travel is becoming less important as social media and email grow ever more pervasive (invasive?).</li><li>Make sure other people know about your research (send PDFs of your papers to colleagues who've inspired your research).</li><li>Keep your shit together and remember that this is a <i>job</i> and <i>not</i> your life.</li></ol>

<h3><strong>What is your profession?</strong></h3>
<p>I have a Masters in behavioral ecology, biodiversity, and evolution and have been a research engineer since 2014.</p>
<h3><strong>What type of research are you involved in?</strong></h3>
<p>Basically, I was trained in entomology, but in my job I mostly work on Neotropical mammals in French Guiana. I work from the field sessions to the laboratory, capturing and sampling of animals, and then molecular biology, population genetics, and taxonomy.</p>
<h3><strong>Why did you become interested in this area of research?</strong></h3>
<p>This area of research is interesting for me because I am very involved in ecological and conservation issues, which are a priority. Moreover, the alternation of the field and the laboratory, as well as a few projects beside, means that there is no routine.</p>
<h3><strong>How did you become interested in photography?</strong></h3>
<p>I started ten years ago. Passionate about insects, it was already a good way to explore this macro-universe and to discover details and fabulous texture. it is also a way to raise public awareness to the ecological cause, and highlight the gorgeousness of insects so unloved. Finally, it is a good excuse to be in nature…</p>
<h3><strong>Where and how was this photo taken?</strong></h3>
<p>This photo was taken in a rainforest in French Guiana with a Canon 7D and a 100mm f/2.8 macro. I never use a flash, even in the dark forest I prefer keeping my ability to move, using natural light and increasing ISO if necessary. <a href="http://www.mailishuguinphotographie.com">http://www.mailishuguinphotographie.com</a></p>
<h3><strong>Why were you there at the time?</strong></h3>
<p>I was involved in a capture field session of little mammals (rodents and marsupials) in the context of wildlife inventories. I always look to see if there are any interesting pictures to take, and this day, it was an ant!</p>
<h3><strong>Can you explain a bit more about the image?</strong></h3>
<p>We can see an Ant of genus <em>Ectatomma</em> who is wide-awake and standing on a leaf.</p>
<h3><strong>What about this scene particularly interested you?</strong></h3>
<p>This behavior is always interesting to observe because it shows the close mutualist relationship that exists between ants and myrmecophile plants: here, the host plant secretes nectar via specialized structures called domaties to feed ants and in exchange these ants protect the plant from predators. That is why, when the ant feels threatened, it takes a defensive position.</p>

<p><em>By</em> <a href="http://www.alexfradera.net/">Alex Fradera</a></p>
<p>In 2007, the University of Pennsylvania psychologist Angela Duckworth authored a <a href="http://psycnet.apa.org/record/2007-07951-009">paper</a> on a trait she called “grit” which went on to arrest the attention of anyone interested in the secrets of success. TED talks and <a href="https://angeladuckworth.com/grit-book/">a 2016 book</a> followed, wherein Duckworth explained how a combination of passion for a topic, and perseverance in the face of difficulties – the two facets of grit – were the recipe for achievement, a claim borne out by studies <a href="http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/1948550610385872">within schools</a> and <a href="http://psycnet.apa.org/buy/2015-56733-003">across the lifespan</a>.</p>
<p>In recent years, however, researchers have become more critical of the scope and relevance of the concept. Now <a href="http://psycnet.apa.org/record/2017-31799-001">an article</a> published in <i>Psychology of Aesthetics, Creativity, and the Arts</i>, suggests grit gives surprisingly little insight into the world of creative success.</p>
<p><span id="more-29880"></span></p>
<p>On first glance, grit seems a must for creatives. Countless artistic professionals associate their success with a passion for their chosen art form, and describe the necessity of perseverance in the face of obstacles and discouragement. But the value of grit isn’t backed by the three new studies from a team led by Magdalena Grohman at the University of Texas.</p>
<p>They used Duckworth’s publicly available “<a href="https://angeladuckworth.com/grit-scale/">grit scale</a>” (which taps passion and perseverance); a personality questionnaire measuring the Big Five traits; and a self-report measure of creativity, the Creative Achievement Questionnaire, which captures public achievement in ten different creative domains such as music or dance, with participants scoring higher if they’ve done things like played in a band or made an original composition.</p>
<p>In an initial survey of 131 university students (two thirds women, average age 19), their creative achievement scores correlated with their scores on the personality measure of Openness to Experience, but showed no significant relationship with either facet of grit.</p>
<p>A second larger study (325 students), with more comprehensive measures of grit and personality, found Openness again correlated with creativity, both on the Creative Achievement Questionnaire and on a measure of everyday creativity capturing frequency of activities such as writing or being a member of a camera club. But again, grit showed no correlation with either creative measure.</p>
<p>This seems surprising, but consider something: the first survey found the “passion” facet of grit (among other things, high scorers say that are not distracted by new ideas and projects) correlated <i>negatively </i>with scores on Openness to Experience. Given that higher Openness is associated strongly with greater creativity, both here and in the wider literature, the negative correlation with grit should give us pause for thought.</p>
<p>Grohman’s team were ahead of us, highlighting that Duckworth defines passion primarily as a commitment to one thing at the expense of others (another example: on the grit scale, passionate people score lower on the item “I become interested in new pursuits every few months”). Openness, as the name suggests, is <i>all about</i> becoming interested in new and different things. Moreover, there is no emotional element in the passion facet of grit as conceptualised by Duckworth: no measure of excitement, joy or elation by participating in the activity. Her notion of passion is less like the fiery, explorative artist, and more like a nerdy completionist devoting their time to finding that last sticker for their 1986 Panini sticker book. And that characterisation simply seems to miss the mark of what we mean by creative passion.</p>
<p>If this sounds unfair, consider Grohman and her colleague’s final study, where they asked high school students to rate classmates’ creativity, in terms of who produced the most original assignments. Their teachers were also asked to rate the students’ persistence and passion, in whatever way they understood those terms, and both these scores correlated with higher student creativity. The students’ self-reported perseverance (as measured by Duckworth’s grit questionnaire) also correlated weakly with their creativity, but this association disappeared once the researchers took account of differences in personality scores.</p>
<p>The fact that teacher-rated passion and teacher-rated persistence correlated with creativity (even after accounting for personality), but that scores on the grit scale did not, suggests that passion is indeed relevant to creativity, but not as conceptualised by Duckworth’s notion of grit.</p>
<p>It’s worth noting that these were student samples rather than professional creatives, so further work would need to be done there too, but given the conceptual tension between passion and Openness, it seems plausible to expect similar patterns to emerge.</p>
<p>Where does this leave grit? Well, with <a href="http://https//www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27845531">a recent meta-analysis</a> suggesting that grit has only modest associations with performance, and is strongly associated with the incumbent personality predictor of success, trait Conscientiousness (also true in this study, with correlations between .54 and.65), it seems appropriate to dial down the grit hype and treat this construct like any other psychological measure – of potential interest, but unlikely to be the breakthrough that changes society.</p>

Abstract is below:</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>Computational models of neurons vary in their biological realism and level of detail, ranging from point neurons such as simple and adaptive exponential integrate-and-fire and Izhikevich models to morphologically realistic conductance based multi-compartmental models. Multi-compartmental models often include representations of voltage and ligand gated ion channels; these can be modelled using (commonly) the Hodgkin-Huxley or (sometimes) the Markov formalism. In this talk, I will give a basic introduction to compartmental modelling of neurons and discuss the Hodgkin-Huxley model. The Hodgkin-Huxley model is one of the foundations of computational neuroscience, having been published in a series of seminal articles in 1952 and leading to the award of the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine to Alan Hodgkin and Andrew Huxley in 1963.</p>

<p><em>By</em> <a href="http://www.christianjarrett.com/">Christian Jarrett</a></p>
<p>According to the <a href="http://cogsci.bme.hu/~ivady/bscs/read/bc.pdf">Extreme Male Brain theory of autism</a>, there are certain cognitive and behavioural characteristics that manifest more often in men than women, on average, such as a bias for systematic rather than empathic thinking. Autism can be seen as as extreme version of that typical male profile, the theory proposes, possibly caused by prenatal <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2009/01/21/fetal-exposure-to-testosterone-linked-with-presence-of-autistic-traits-in-childhood/">exposure to higher than usual amounts of testosterone in the womb</a>.</p>
<p>A related observation is that exposure to high concentrations of prenatal testosterone leads to the development of “hyper masculine” facial features. It follows that if the Extreme Male Brain theory of autism is accurate, then autistic people will have hypermasculine faces.</p>
<p>A <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-017-09939-y">new study</a> in <em>Scientific Reports</em> put this logic to the test, and consistent with the Extreme Male Brain theory, found that autistic girls and boys had more masculine faces as compared with neurotypical control children.</p>
<p><span id="more-29894"></span></p>
<p>Past research into whether autistic people tend to have stereotypically masculine facial features has been mixed. Women with sub-clinical autistic traits or a diagnosis of autism have been found to have more masculine than average faces, but studies with autistic men have sometimes found no difference from controls, or they’ve found the autistic men to have androgynous rather than hyper masculine features.</p>
<p>For their new paper, the research team led by Diana Tan at the University of Western Australia, deliberately sought to test pre-pubescent autistic and neurotypical children, thus removing the possibility that hormonal changes during puberty might conceal or reverse any facial signs of prenatal exposure to high testosterone levels (as may have been the case in the earlier research involving adults).</p>
<p>Tan and her colleagues also employed a new 3D facial mapping process, tested on 48 neurotypical boys and 53 neurotypical girls, to provide a highly accurate and objective measure of the facial features that most typify a male and female child’s face. Using these features, the researchers’ algorithm was able to correctly categorise the sex of children’s faces with around 98 per cent accuracy.</p>
<p>Next, the researchers deployed their 3D facial mapping algorithm to score the facial features of 54 caucasian autistic boys, 20 caucasian autistic girls and age-matched neurotypical caucasian boys and girls. This showed that the autistic boys and girls had more masculine than usual faces – to use the researchers’ jargon, their faces were hypermasculinised.</p>
<p>Moreover, when the researchers compared the autistic children and control children’s faces on the six facial features (mostly related to the positioning of the nose and upper lip) that most strongly distinguished neurotypcial boys’ faces from girls’ faces, the autistic kids of both sexes were found to have a more masculine score than controls on five of these features.</p>
<p>Finally, among the autistic boys and girls, the more masculinised their faces, the more social and communication difficulties they tended to have, as scored in their diagnostic test for autism.</p>
<p>The sample sizes for this study were relatively small, but the study’s biggest weakness is that it asks us to make a logical leap – high prenatal testosterone levels are known to cause faces to appear more masculine, autistic children have more masculine than average faces (as shown by the new results), <em>therefore</em> high prenatal testosterone levels contribute to autism (in line with the Extreme Male Brain Theory). However, as the researchers’ themselves acknowledge, this study featured no data on the testosterone levels that the children were exposed to prenatally, meaning there could be other explanations for the results. “Further investigation that tracks longitudinal links between early testosterone exposure, postnatal facial morphology and autism phenotype will provide more direct tests of the hypothesised relationships,” they said.</p>
<p>The Extreme Male Brain theory has inspired important research into the causes of autism, but it has also been controversial. Cordelia Fine, the author of <em>Delusions of Gender</em> and <em>Testosterone Rex</em>, cites the theory as an example of contemporary “neurosexism”. And other recent research has uncovered findings that are inconsistent with the theory – for instance, <a href="https://academic.oup.com/scan/article/11/6/1002/2224225/Sex-differences-in-autism-a-resting-state-fMRI">last year a brain imaging study found that</a>, compared with male neurotypical controls, autistic boys and men had resting connectivity patterns that resembled what’s more typically seen in women, while autistic girls and women showed a more masculine neurological profile, lending support “to the notion that autistic spectrum disorder may constitute a disorder of sexual differentiation or androgeny rather than a disorder characterized by masculinization in both genders.”</p>

<img alt="" class="attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image" height="110" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2017/09/Sydney_skyline_from_the_north_aerial_2010-140x110.jpg" style="display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;" width="140" /><p>In the face of cancer, people are not all equal. An individual’s likelihood of survival following a cancer diagnosis depends on many factors. These include tumor characteristics, such as site, size and spread; demographic factors such as age; but also where people are born and live along with the conditions of daily life – the so called social determinants of health. This broader environment impacts on how healthy our lives are, how early cancer is detected and what kind of treatment we receive.</p>
<p>We examined comparative cancer survival in New South Wales (NSW), the most populous state in Australia, over a 30-year period and identified higher risk of cancer death for those living in socio-economically disadvantaged areas and outside major cities. These survival disparities remained when we took into account differences in age, cancer stage at diagnosis, potential other causes of deaths, and differences in cancer site between population groups.</p>
<p>Disparities in cancer survival may be explained by factors that we cannot easily measure when using data from cancer registries. Factors that our study could not take into consideration included comorbidities, health behaviors, social support, and clinical cancer care. These factors are likely to impact overall cancer survival and any survival differences.</p>
<h3><strong>Quality of treatment</strong></h3>
<blockquote><p>New treatment options and technologies, as well as clinical trials of new treatments may be less accessible to deprived population groups</p></blockquote>
<p>Treatment is an important factor to consider when assessing cancer survival differences. There is evidence that <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24491311">disadvantaged population groups may receive less optimal treatment</a>. New treatment options and technologies, as well as clinical trials of new treatments may be less accessible to deprived population groups.</p>
<p>Although we could not determine how much survival differences found in our study were driven by varied access to and/or quality of treatment, a universal health care system is expected to diminish some differences in health status between population groups. Despite the universal health care system in Australia, people with lower socio-economic status had worse cancer outcomes in NSW.</p>
<p>The findings from our study are unlikely to be specific to NSW or Australia. In fact, the association between lower socio-economic status and lower cancer survival has been <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22999326">demonstrated in several countries</a>, including <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20717112">other countries which also have universal health coverage and extensive social safety nets</a>. This further highlights that cancer survival disparities are not entirely explained, nor fixed, by health care system related factors; a broader socio-economic context appears to be exerting an influence.</p>
<p>In NSW, the comparative risk of cancer death in people living in socio-economically disadvantaged areas has increased over time. Cancer survival has improved over time for everyone but it seems that improvements have been greater or happened more quickly for well-off people, and consequently the survival gap has increased.</p>
<h3><strong>Cancer survival in migrants</strong></h3>
<p>We also examined cancer survival by migrant status and grouped people based on their country of birth into those from English-speaking and non-English speaking countries. Australia has a large migrant population with more than a quarter of the population born outside Australia.</p>
<p>Migrant groups may be disadvantaged in terms of health outcomes due to cultural, linguistic and health literacy barriers. However, according to our results, people born in other English-speaking countries had a similar risk, and those born in non-English speaking countries had a lower risk of cancer death compared with the Australian-born.</p>
<blockquote><p>According to our results … those born in non-English speaking countries had a lower risk of cancer death compared with the Australian-born</p></blockquote>
<p>This is perhaps surprising especially if we assume that language skills are associated with capacity to navigate through the health system, and that these navigation skills translate into better health outcomes.</p>
<p>It is likely that better survival in people born in non-English speaking countries is partly artefactual. Migrants are commonly healthier than the general population (so called ‘healthy migrant’ effect). They may also return to their home countries for the final stages of their life, so that information about their deaths won’t be recorded in the country where they were diagnosed with cancer.</p>
<p>Considering our <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26703888">previous findings</a> that people born outside Australia had slightly higher risk of being diagnosed with advanced stage cancer, loss to follow-up appears to be a plausible explanation for recorded cancer survival advantage for some migrant groups in our study.</p>
<p>Socio-economic disadvantage is a complex concept with no consensus on how best to measure it. Several factors, including education, income, employment and family background have differing and likely culture-dependent effects on a person’s socio-economic status. We measured socio-economic disadvantage using an area-based measure which may not correspond to individual’s social class or position.</p>
<p>To be able to develop targeted actions and interventions, a more in-depth understanding of reasons driving socio-economic differences in cancer survival is needed. Such factors are likely to lie outside the direct responsibility of the health sector. Therefore, properly resourced and co-ordinated input from service providers from different sectors is essential for closing the socio-economic cancer survival gap.</p>

                <h4><a href="http://brainblogger.com/2017/09/13/the-mystery-of-amyotrophic-lateral-sclerosis/">The Mystery of Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis</a></h4>

<p>Almost 150 years have passed since Jean-Martin Charcot first described <a href="http://brainblogger.com/2015/09/26/celiac-disease-and-amyotrophic-lateral-sclerosis-is-there-a-link/">amyotrophic lateral sclerosis</a> (ALS), also known as motor neuron disease, an ailment that leads to the destruction of motor neurons. Medical sciences have progressed tremendously in the last century, resulting in serious improvements in health care and our ability to manage even the most serious of conditions. However, this is not the case for ALS. The progress in understanding this disease has been slow. Even today, there is no clear diagnostic criteria, no single confirmatory diagnostic test, not to mention a cure. But that does not mean that nothing has changed. The first effective drug to slow down the progress of the disease was approved in the 1990s. This article will briefly review the progress that has been made towards combating this disease.</p>
<p>Our muscles are made in such a way that if the neurons that supply them fail, the muscles also start to degrade. <a href="http://brainblogger.com/2012/11/20/amyotrophic-lateral-sclerosis-is-an-early-diagnosis-possible/">ALS</a> is a disease characterized by progressive weakening of muscles due to the failure of neurons until the muscles are no longer able to support the body’s vital activities. For the majority of patients, the lifespan after disease onset is only two to five years, but there are long-term survivors too. The famous physicist Stephen Hawking was diagnosed with ASL in 1963 and has lived with the condition for over 40 years already.</p>
<p>The worldwide incidence of ALS is not known exactly, but in Europe 2.6 cases of disease per 100,000 people are diagnosed each year. The highest onset is in the age group of 58–63 years. Not all causes of the disease are understood, but familial (~10%) and genetic (~65%) factors are usually considered to be the main causes. Old age, male gender, and <a href="http://brainblogger.com/2015/06/11/epigenetics-and-its-major-influence-on-life/">genetics</a> remain the only recognized risk factors. The risk for the disease also appears to be increased by a number of environmental and lifestyle factors. Below is the summary of all the risk factors known to date:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Familial aggregation</em> – persons with a family history of ALS are at increased risk.</li>
<li><em>Genetics</em> – several genes have been identified, although their role is not fully understood. The most common genes accepted to play a role in ALS include SOD1, TARDBP, FUS, OPTN, VCP, UBQLN2, C9ORF72, and PFN1.</li>
<li><em>Chromosomes</em> – the expanded GGGGCC repeat is associated with ALS.</li>
<li><em>Lifestyle risk factors</em>: Most of them are preventable.<em>Smoking</em> is known to be neurotoxic and increase the risk of ALS; <em>dietary factors</em> such as antioxidants like <a href="http://brainblogger.com/2011/03/16/vitamin-e-small-risk-big-consequences/">vitamin E</a> may have a preventive role in ALS. Consequently, diet may have something to do with ALS; <em>low body weight</em> may increase risk and worsen outcomes; <em>athleticism and chronic traumatic encephalopathy</em> should not be misinterpreted, physical exercise decreases the risk of ALS, but the risk is higher among professional athletes who tend to be at higher risk of trauma.</li>
<li><em>Occupations with high trauma rates</em> – ALS prevalence has been shown to be higher in US <a href="http://brainblogger.com/2013/06/22/big-changes-for-diagnosing-ptsd/">war veterans</a> and people working with low magnetic fields like welders and electricians.</li>
<li><em>Pesticides </em> – are widely used and have been suggested as a risk factor in various neurodegenerative disorders for some time.</li>
<li><em>Some medical conditions </em> – include head trauma, cancer, chronic inflammatory diseases, certain viral infections, and neuroinflammation.</li>
</ul>
<p>The existence of so many factors influencing the development of the disease underlines the complex nature of ALS.</p>
<p>The presentation of ALS varies greatly from person to person, so does the survival rate. However, the vast majority (almost half) of patients do not live for more than 30 months after disease onset. Despite this, ~20% can survive for five to ten years, while others can expect to live even longer.</p>
<p>There is little clarity when it comes to predicting the chance of survival for a person with ALS. However, the odds are better when the disease starts at a younger age. Also, life expectancy depends on where in the body the disease first started. The three major early stage presentations include:</p>
<ol>
<li>Limb-onset ALS with the involvement of both the upper and lower <a href="http://brainblogger.com/2017/05/11/motor-neurons-why-are-they-important-and-how-are-they-made/">motor neurons</a> (UMNs and LMNs).</li>
<li>Bulbar-onset ALS that often starts with speech and swallowing difficulties, and with limb features developing later.</li>
<li>Less common is pure UMN involvement and muscular atrophy with LMN involvement.</li>
</ol>
<p>The bulbar-onset ALS has the worst prognosis since the vital functioning of organs is affected at an early stage. This often leads to early respiratory failure.</p>
<p>There is also lots of controversy in the scientific literature when it comes to the question of where the disease begins. Some researchers believe that it starts in the brain and then migrates to the peripheral nerves and muscles (hence this theory is called “Dying-forward”). Other scientists believe that it all starts at the periphery at the <a href="http://brainblogger.com/2014/12/05/what-is-als-the-real-challenge/">neuromuscular junction</a> and later affects the neurons in the brain (hence this theory is called “Dying-backward”).</p>
<p>Due to the lack of diagnostic tests in early disease, clinicians have to depend on clinical symptoms, identifying combinations of UMN and LMN signs. There is usually further delay with definite diagnostics, as the typical ALS symptoms can be part of many other rare <a href="http://brainblogger.com/2014/04/24/surprising-role-of-prions-in-neurodegenerative-diseases/">neurodegenerative disorders</a>. Thus, an elaborate clinical and laboratory analysis is required for differential diagnosis, where tests involving brain imaging are often helpful for early diagnosis.</p>
<p>As there is no complete understanding of why, where, and how the disease starts, finding treatment remains challenging. Further, the lack of proper early stage diagnostic techniques means that precious time is lost when the probability of effective treatment is at its highest.</p>
<p>To date, there is only one drug, Riluzole, that has been shown to change the course of the disease, and it only helps for a few months. But this does not mean that there is no progress. Lots of promising research has been achieved in other animals, and there is need to translate this research to humans.</p>
<p>At present, most of the treatment for ALS is symptomatic and supportive. They include physiotherapy, orthotics, and treatment of pain, dysphagia (difficulty in swallowing), dyspnea (difficulty in breathing), pain, constipation, loss of voice, and mental and emotional problems.</p>

<p><em>By</em> <a href="http://www.alexfradera.net/">Alex Fradera</a></p>
<p>Secrets burden minds. To understand how, researchers have previously focused on the act of concealment during one-off social interactions, showing that keeping a secret is draining and can increase anxiety. But what about the longer-term toll? A <a href="http://psycnet.apa.org/record/2017-20428-001">new paper</a> in <i>Attitudes and Social Cognition </i>describes ten studies on the impact of secrecy day-on-day, showing how the burden of a secret peppers our waking life with reminders and periods of brooding.</p>
<p><span id="more-29878"></span></p>
<p>The Columbia University team – Michael Slepian, Jinseok Chun, and Malia Mason – first developed and validated a secrets survey with two thousand participants. From this they identified 38 classes of secrets covering a range of contexts from theft and drug use to sexual orientation.</p>
<p>Using the new survey with 600 more participants (for most of the paper, participants were recruited from an online portal and tended to be in their thirties), the researchers found that 96 per cent of them currently had a secret of some kind, most commonly romantic thoughts about someone outside their relationship, sexual behaviour, or emotional infidelity.</p>
<p>The researchers also asked participants to consider the past month and report how often they were in a situation where they had to conceal their secret, and how often their mind wandered to the secret when there was no need for concealment. Mind-wandering was twice as common as episodes involving concealment, and crucially, it was how often participants caught themselves thinking about the secret – but not how often they had to actively conceal it – that was associated with the impact of the secret on their lives, as measured by their ratings of how much “this secret made my life and well-being worse”.</p>
<p>This apparently adverse effect of thinking about our secrets was replicated in a survey of tourists canvassed in New York. These findings suggest that active concealment – the primary focus of most secrecy research, and tightly wound into its scientific definition – may not be the defining characteristic of secrecy, and that it may rather be the repeated reflections upon hidden information that enact a greater psychological toll.</p>
<p>However, this research hasn’t shown a causal link between secret-related mind-wandering and wellbeing because the results are correlational (it would be hard to test this experimentally because it would be unethical to insert troubling life secrets into people’s lives). It seems likely that the association is at least partly caused by some toxic secrets both springing into mind more readily and having their own directly harmful influence on a person’s life. However, further analysis showed that higher secret-related mind-wandering still correlated with lower wellbeing regardless of the importance of a secret or the deviancy of the information it contained – suggesting repetitive thoughts about any kind of secret can take a toll.</p>
<p>What about secrets that are more obviously troubling to conceal (such as hiding an affair or trauma from a loved one) – might the act of concealment itself take a greater toll in these situations? To check this, the researchers focused in further studies on weightier secrets that the participants felt guilty for keeping from their partner. Yet participants still described mind-wandering about the secret more often than having to conceal it (one longitudinal study estimated mind wandering to be 2.5 times more frequent than concealment). And again, more frequent mind-wandering was associated with lower wellbeing, both in terms of diminished life satisfaction and relationship quality.</p>
<p>If these results are accurate and mind-wandering about secrets really does chip away at our wellbeing, what is the psychological process? It’s psychologically harmful to ruminate on negative thoughts or memories, and recalling a secret often involves accessing such content, so perhaps the same process is at play? It seems not. Slepian’s team asked 186 more participants to either recall a negative life event known to their partner or a secret they kept from them. Participants considered the negative life event more unpleasant than did those in the secret group, but it was the latter group who reported feeling less satisfied with life in that moment, suggesting that this wellbeing drop wasn’t simply a matter of bad feeling. Rather, the secrecy-related dissatisfaction was associated with a self-reported sense of weakened authenticity.</p>
<p>We often feel forced to keep a secret because we fear the cost of revealing it. But this research suggests that the secret is already costing you, even when you’re not actively concealing it, through a steady drip of reminders that makes you resent your own obstruction of a well-lived life. That doesn’t mean that it’s straightforward to put aside the deception. But if you can find a way, it may change how you experience life: not just through the big release, but a freer mental space, day on day.</p>

<p>
 Type 2 innate lymphoid cells (ILC2s) both contribute to mucosal homeostasis and initiate pathologic inflammation in allergic asthma. However, the signals that direct ILC2s to promote homeostasis versus inflammation are unclear. To identify such molecular cues, we profiled mouse lung-resident ILCs using single-cell RNA sequencing at steady state and after in vivo stimulation with the alarmin cytokines IL-25 and IL-33. ILC2s were transcriptionally heterogeneous after activation, with subpopulations distinguished by expression of proliferative, homeostatic and effector genes. The neuropeptide receptor Nmur1 was preferentially expressed by ILC2s at steady state and after IL-25 stimulation. Neuromedin U (NMU), the ligand of NMUR1, activated ILC2s in vitro, and in vivo co-administration of NMU with IL-25 strongly amplified allergic inflammation. Loss of NMU–NMUR1 signalling reduced ILC2 frequency and effector function, and altered transcriptional programs following allergen challenge in vivo. Thus, NMUR1 signalling promotes inflammatory ILC2 responses, highlighting the importance of neuro-immune crosstalk in allergic inflammation at mucosal surfaces.

                <h4><a href="http://feeds.nature.com/~r/NatureBiologicalSciencesResearch/~3/Gkj_Jh5Js5Y/nature23910">Maternal gut bacteria promote neurodevelopmental abnormalities in mouse offspring</a></h4>

<p>
 Maternal immune activation (MIA) contributes to behavioural abnormalities associated with neurodevelopmental disorders in both primate and rodent offspring. In humans, epidemiological studies suggest that exposure of fetuses to maternal inflammation increases the likelihood of developing autism spectrum disorder. In pregnant mice, interleukin-17a (IL-17a) produced by T helper 17 (TH17) cells (CD4+ T helper effector cells involved in multiple inflammatory conditions) induces behavioural and cortical abnormalities in the offspring exposed to MIA. However, it is unclear whether other maternal factors are required to promote MIA-associated phenotypes. Moreover, the underlying mechanisms by which MIA leads to T cell activation with increased IL-17a in the maternal circulation are not well understood. Here we show that MIA phenotypes in offspring require maternal intestinal bacteria that promote TH17 cell differentiation. Pregnant mice that had been colonized with mouse commensal segmented filamentous bacteria or human commensal bacteria that induce intestinal TH17 cells were more likely to produce offspring with MIA-associated abnormalities. We also show that small intestine dendritic cells from pregnant, but not from non-pregnant, females secrete IL-1β, IL-23 and IL-6 and stimulate T cells to produce IL-17a upon exposure to MIA. Overall, our data suggest that defined gut commensal bacteria with a propensity to induce TH17 cells may increase the risk of neurodevelopmental disorders in the offspring of pregnant mothers undergoing immune system activation owing to infections or autoinflammatory syndromes.

<p>
 Viral infection during pregnancy is correlated with increased frequency of neurodevelopmental disorders, and this is studied in mice prenatally subjected to maternal immune activation (MIA). We previously showed that maternal T helper 17 cells promote the development of cortical and behavioural abnormalities in MIA-affected offspring. Here we show that cortical abnormalities are preferentially localized to a region encompassing the dysgranular zone of the primary somatosensory cortex (S1DZ). Moreover, activation of pyramidal neurons in this cortical region was sufficient to induce MIA-associated behavioural phenotypes in wild-type animals, whereas reduction in neural activity rescued the behavioural abnormalities in MIA-affected offspring. Sociability and repetitive behavioural phenotypes could be selectively modulated according to the efferent targets of S1DZ. Our work identifies a cortical region primarily, if not exclusively, centred on the S1DZ as the major node of a neural network that mediates behavioural abnormalities observed in offspring exposed to maternal inflammation.

<p>
 Human transcription factor IIH (TFIIH) is part of the general transcriptional machinery required by RNA polymerase II for the initiation of eukaryotic gene transcription. Composed of ten subunits that add up to a molecular mass of about 500 kDa, TFIIH is also essential for nucleotide excision repair. The seven-subunit TFIIH core complex formed by XPB, XPD, p62, p52, p44, p34, and p8 is competent for DNA repair, while the CDK-activating kinase subcomplex, which includes the kinase activity of CDK7 as well as the cyclin H and MAT1 subunits, is additionally required for transcription initiation. Mutations in the TFIIH subunits XPB, XPD, and p8 lead to severe premature ageing and cancer propensity in the genetic diseases xeroderma pigmentosum, Cockayne syndrome, and trichothiodystrophy, highlighting the importance of TFIIH for cellular physiology. Here we present the cryo-electron microscopy structure of human TFIIH at 4.4 Å resolution. The structure reveals the molecular architecture of the TFIIH core complex, the detailed structures of its constituent XPB and XPD ATPases, and how the core and kinase subcomplexes of TFIIH are connected. Additionally, our structure provides insight into the conformational dynamics of TFIIH and the regulation of its activity.

                <h4><a href="http://feeds.nature.com/~r/NatureBiologicalSciencesResearch/~3/R81QDcATcKE/nature23902">Alternative evolutionary histories in the sequence space of an ancient protein</a></h4>

<p>
 To understand why molecular evolution turned out as it did, we must characterize not only the path that evolution followed across the space of possible molecular sequences but also the many alternative trajectories that could have been taken but were not. A large-scale comparison of real and possible histories would establish whether the outcome of evolution represents an optimal state driven by natural selection or the contingent product of historical chance events; it would also reveal how the underlying distribution of functions across sequence space shaped historical evolution. Here we combine ancestral protein reconstruction with deep mutational scanning to characterize alternative histories in the sequence space around an ancient transcription factor, which evolved a novel biological function through well-characterized mechanisms. We find hundreds of alternative protein sequences that use diverse biochemical mechanisms to perform the derived function at least as well as the historical outcome. These alternatives all require prior permissive substitutions that do not enhance the derived function, but not all require the same permissive changes that occurred during history. We find that if evolution had begun from a different starting point within the network of sequences encoding the ancestral function, outcomes with different genetic and biochemical forms would probably have resulted; this contingency arises from the distribution of functional variants in sequence space and epistasis between residues. Our results illuminate the topology of the vast space of possibilities from which history sampled one path, highlighting how the outcome of evolution depends on a serial chain of compounding chance events.

<p>
 Constituting approximately 10% of flowering plant species, orchids (Orchidaceae) display unique flower morphologies, possess an extraordinary diversity in lifestyle, and have successfully colonized almost every habitat on Earth. Here we report the draft genome sequence of Apostasia shenzhenica, a representative of one of two genera that form a sister lineage to the rest of the Orchidaceae, providing a reference for inferring the genome content and structure of the most recent common ancestor of all extant orchids and improving our understanding of their origins and evolution. In addition, we present transcriptome data for representatives of Vanilloideae, Cypripedioideae and Orchidoideae, and novel third-generation genome data for two species of Epidendroideae, covering all five orchid subfamilies. A. shenzhenica shows clear evidence of a whole-genome duplication, which is shared by all orchids and occurred shortly before their divergence. Comparisons between A. shenzhenica and other orchids and angiosperms also permitted the reconstruction of an ancestral orchid gene toolkit. We identify new gene families, gene family expansions and contractions, and changes within MADS-box gene classes, which control a diverse suite of developmental processes, during orchid evolution. This study sheds new light on the genetic mechanisms underpinning key orchid innovations, including the development of the labellum and gynostemium, pollinia, and seeds without endosperm, as well as the evolution of epiphytism; reveals relationships between the Orchidaceae subfamilies; and helps clarify the evolutionary history of orchids within the angiosperms.

<p>
 Cytosolic DNA arising from intracellular pathogens triggers a powerful innate immune response. It is sensed by cyclic GMP–AMP synthase (cGAS), which elicits the production of type I interferons by generating the second messenger 2′3′-cyclic-GMP–AMP (cGAMP). Endogenous nuclear or mitochondrial DNA can also be sensed by cGAS under certain conditions, resulting in sterile inflammation. The cGAS dimer binds two DNA ligands shorter than 20 base pairs side-by-side, but 20-base-pair DNA fails to activate cGAS in vivo and is a poor activator in vitro. Here we show that cGAS is activated in a strongly DNA length-dependent manner both in vitro and in human cells. We also show that cGAS dimers form ladder-like networks with DNA, leading to cooperative sensing of DNA length: assembly of the pioneering cGAS dimer between two DNA molecules is ineffective; but, once formed, it prearranges the flanking DNA to promote binding of subsequent cGAS dimers. Remarkably, bacterial and mitochondrial nucleoid proteins HU and mitochondrial transcription factor A (TFAM), as well as high-mobility group box 1 protein (HMGB1), can strongly stimulate long DNA sensing by cGAS. U-turns and bends in DNA induced by these proteins pre-structure DNA to nucleate cGAS dimers. Our results suggest a nucleation-cooperativity-based mechanism for sensitive detection of mitochondrial DNA and pathogen genomes, and identify HMGB/TFAM proteins as DNA-structuring host factors. They provide an explanation for the peculiar cGAS dimer structure and suggest that cGAS preferentially binds incomplete nucleoid-like structures or bent DNA.

<p>
 Identification of neural circuit changes that contribute to behavioural plasticity has routinely been conducted on candidate circuits that were preselected on the basis of previous results. Here we present an unbiased method for identifying experience-triggered circuit-level changes in neuronal ensembles in mice. Using rabies virus monosynaptic tracing, we mapped cocaine-induced global changes in inputs onto neurons in the ventral tegmental area. Cocaine increased rabies-labelled inputs from the globus pallidus externus (GPe), a basal ganglia nucleus not previously known to participate in behavioural plasticity triggered by drugs of abuse. We demonstrated that cocaine increased GPe neuron activity, which accounted for the increase in GPe labelling. Inhibition of GPe activity revealed that it contributes to two forms of cocaine-triggered behavioural plasticity, at least in part by disinhibiting dopamine neurons in the ventral tegmental area. These results suggest that rabies-based unbiased screening of changes in input populations can identify previously unappreciated circuit elements that critically support behavioural adaptations.

<p>
 Pericyclic reactions—which proceed in a concerted fashion through a cyclic transition state—are among the most powerful synthetic transformations used to make multiple regioselective and stereoselective carbon–carbon bonds. They have been widely applied to the synthesis of biologically active complex natural products containing contiguous stereogenic carbon centres. Despite the prominence of pericyclic reactions in total synthesis, only three naturally existing enzymatic examples (the intramolecular Diels–Alder reaction, and the Cope and the Claisen rearrangements) have been characterized. Here we report a versatile S-adenosyl-l-methionine (SAM)-dependent enzyme, LepI, that can catalyse stereoselective dehydration followed by three pericyclic transformations: intramolecular Diels–Alder and hetero-Diels–Alder reactions via a single ambimodal transition state, and a retro-Claisen rearrangement. Together, these transformations lead to the formation of the dihydropyran core of the fungal natural product, leporin. Combined in vitro enzymatic characterization and computational studies provide insight into how LepI regulates these bifurcating biosynthetic reaction pathways by using SAM as the cofactor. These pathways converge to the desired biosynthetic end product via the (SAM-dependent) retro-Claisen rearrangement catalysed by LepI. We expect that more pericyclic biosynthetic enzymatic transformations remain to be discovered in naturally occurring enzyme ‘toolboxes’. The new role of the versatile cofactor SAM is likely to be found in other examples of enzyme catalysis.

                <h4><a href="http://feeds.nature.com/~r/NatureBiologicalSciencesResearch/~3/EDuvY0fgu7Q/nature23658">Hippocampal LTP and contextual learning require surface diffusion of AMPA receptors</a></h4>

<p>
 Long-term potentiation (LTP) of excitatory synaptic transmission has long been considered a cellular correlate for learning and memory. Early LTP (less than 1 h) had initially been explained either by presynaptic increases in glutamate release or by direct modification of postsynaptic AMPA (α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid) receptor function. Compelling models have more recently proposed that synaptic potentiation can occur by the recruitment of additional postsynaptic AMPA receptors (AMPARs), sourced either from an intracellular reserve pool by exocytosis or from nearby extra-synaptic receptors pre-existing on the neuronal surface. However, the exact mechanism through which synapses can rapidly recruit new AMPARs during early LTP remains unknown. In particular, direct evidence for a pivotal role of AMPAR surface diffusion as a trafficking mechanism in synaptic plasticity is still lacking. Here, using AMPAR immobilization approaches, we show that interfering with AMPAR surface diffusion markedly impairs synaptic potentiation of Schaffer collaterals and commissural inputs to the CA1 area of the mouse hippocampus in cultured slices, acute slices and in vivo. Our data also identify distinct contributions of various AMPAR trafficking routes to the temporal profile of synaptic potentiation. In addition, AMPAR immobilization in vivo in the dorsal hippocampus inhibited fear conditioning, indicating that AMPAR diffusion is important for the early phase of contextual learning. Therefore, our results provide a direct demonstration that the recruitment of new receptors to synapses by surface diffusion is a critical mechanism for the expression of LTP and hippocampal learning. Since AMPAR surface diffusion is dictated by weak Brownian forces that are readily perturbed by protein–protein interactions, we anticipate that this fundamental trafficking mechanism will be a key target for modulating synaptic potentiation and learning.

<p>Computer scientist Luc Steels uses artificial intelligence to explore the origins and evolution of language. He is best known for his 1999–2001 Talking Heads Experiment, in which robots had to construct a language from scratch to communicate with each other. Now Steels, who works at the Free University of Brussels (VUB), has composed an opera based on the legend of Faust, with a twenty-first-century twist. He talks about Mozart as a nascent computer programmer, how music maps onto language, and the blurred boundaries of a digitized world.</p><p>Nature 549 157 <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/549157a">doi: 10.1038/549157a</a></p><img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/NatureNewsComment/~4/gT5r1ehNCuM" width="1" />

<img alt="" class="webfeedsFeaturedVisual wp-post-image" height="150" src="http://blogs.plos.org/plos/files/2017/09/slice-of-pie-150x150.png" style="display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;" width="150" /><div class="wp_orcid_field"><a href="http://orcid.org/0000-0001-7318-5892" rel="author" target="_blank">0000-0001-7318-5892</a></div><p>Scientists depend on the proper evaluation of research that creates the foundation for future work, and the public expects curated scientific content to be trustworthy. All forms of peer review, whether for ethical, technical and sound science criteria or for additional novelty, significance and perceived impact help ensure rigor in scientific research.</p>
<p>There is, however, community and public skepticism regarding the quality, trustworthiness and authenticity of the review process, from the initial stage of evaluation before reviewer assignment to the final editorial decision. Making peer review more transparent, at any stage, has the potential to revitalize the process and restore trust in the system.</p>
<p>Efforts to increase transparency in peer review should address challenges that include:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="http://www.sciencemag.org/careers/2016/09/how-review-paper" target="_blank">Training and mentoring</a></strong> on <strong><a href="https://violentmetaphors.com/2013/12/13/how-to-become-good-at-peer-review-a-guide-for-young-scientists/" target="_blank">how to review</a></strong> (<strong><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/higher-education-network/blog/2013/sep/27/peer-review-10-tips-research-paper" target="_blank">see ten tips here</a></strong>)</li>
<li>Variable publisher <strong><a href="https://ec.europa.eu/research/openscience/index.cfm?pg=home&amp;section=monitor" target="_blank">open science and transparency policies</a></strong></li>
<li>A process that is static in time and in <strong><a href="http://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.1002506" target="_blank">number of people that participate</a></strong></li>
<li>Insights made during the review process often go <strong><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/science/occams-corner/2015/sep/07/peer-review-preprints-speed-science-journals" target="_blank">uncaptured or remain hidden</a></strong></li>
</ul>
<h4><strong>Reshaping Peer Review</strong></h4>
<p>Change is already happening as the scientific community develops variations on themes of open and transparent, and as publishers provide more peer review offerings that range from community participation to open but anonymous, to fully open and signed reviews. While not yet functioning at scale, experiments incorporating more transparent ways to discuss and assess papers over the entire lifecycle of the research are inching their way into practice. This way, the publication of an article isn’t the single defining event in its life; it is just one chapter of its story. Many of the arguments in favor of increased transparency in peer review also hold true in the discussion of <strong><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/science/occams-corner/2015/sep/07/peer-review-preprints-speed-science-journals" target="_blank">benefits of preprint submissions</a></strong>. According to researchers working with neuroimaging, as stated in their <em>PLOS Biology </em><strong><a href="http://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.1002506" target="_blank">Community Page</a></strong>, “preprints allow the wider community to give feedback to the authors about the manuscript and potentially improve it, which is beneficial for both the authors as well as the journal the paper will be submitted to. For example, the present paper received useful comments from three individuals in addition to the appointed peer reviewers.”</p>
<h4><strong>A Question of Signing</strong></h4>
<p>At PLOS, we’ve looked at one slice of transparency in peer review—signed reviews made available exclusively to the authors. In a research project that used a survey mechanism to collect experiences and opinions, our Publishing Operations team underwent an assessment of reviews from 2013-2016 in three of the PLOS journals (<strong><a href="http://journals.plos.org/plosone/" target="_blank"><em>PLOS ONE</em></a></strong>, <strong><a href="http://journals.plos.org/plosmedicine/" target="_blank"><em>PLOS Medicine</em></a></strong> and <strong><a href="http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/" target="_blank"><em>PLOS Computational Biology</em></a></strong>).</p>
<blockquote><p>“Our reviewer community is particularly engaged, and that’s what makes working at PLOS on this issue so exciting. Together we will be able to create solutions, both incremental and substantial, that bring constructive feedback to authors and transparency to the review process.” Helen Atkins, PLOS Director of Publishing Operations</p></blockquote>
<p>Some of what we learned is that reviewers who were not in the habit of signing reviews simply had never been asked, or were not sure of the benefits. But it’s not as easy as just educating in these areas. These scientists also indicated that not signing allows them to be more honest and safe from retribution. We also discovered that signing can improve reviewer accountability and constructiveness, and help authors learn of a reviewer’s area of expertise. Authors who favored receiving signed reviews valued having this additional information as it provides potential for more open communication, moving research forward. The full results of this project, presented by Elizabeth Seiver, PLOS Researcher and Helen Atkins are part of the Editorial and Peer-Review Process Innovations Session on Tuesday, September 12 during the <strong><a href="http://peerreviewcongress.org/program-information" target="_blank">International Congress on Peer Review and Scientific Publication</a></strong>.</p>
<h4><strong>Simple but Substantive Practices </strong></h4>
<p>In the <em>PLOS ONE</em> article “<strong><a href="http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0147913" target="_blank">Peer Review Quality and Transparency of the Peer-Review Process in Open Access and Subscription Journals</a></strong>,” the focus is a general aspect of transparency in peer review—how academic journals (and/or publishers) present their peer-review process to the public. According to the authors of this study, a transparent peer review system “conveys to readers and potential contributors how the peer review is implemented and how articles are selected for publication.” The researchers found that “author’s ratings of peer-review transparency predicted their assessment of the quality of peer-review at that journal.”  Even small changes in practices and on publisher websites can help in this area. In addition, guidelines from the <strong><a href="https://publicationethics.org/" target="_blank">Committee on Publication Ethics</a></strong>, “<strong><a href="http://publicationethics.org/files/Principles_of_Transparency_and_Best_Practice_in_Scholarly_Publishing.pdf" target="_blank">Principles of Transparency and Best Practice in Scholarly Publishing</a></strong>,” stating that all journal content apart from editorial material should be subject to peer review from outside experts must be met.</p>
<h4><strong>Learning from Early Career Researchers</strong></h4>
<p>Many ECRs do not get appropriate training on how to prepare or review manuscripts. Improved transparency in peer review would not only satisfy mid-to senior-level scientists, but in providing some form of open dialogue or open accountability it enables these scientists to lead by example and provide mentorship to the next generation of reviewers.</p>
<p>Young and upcoming scientists have plenty of ideas when it comes to improving transparency in peer review. At PLOS, we received over 150 essays on how to revamp peer review from Early Career Researchers applying for our <strong><a href="https://www.plos.org/ecr-travel-awards" target="_blank">ECR Travel Award Program</a></strong>. These creative young scientists described what they consider to be characteristics of the optimal peer review process and how they might build this process either from scratch or using aspects of existing practice.</p>
<p>Their ideas, edited for brevity, include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Invite reviewers to publish reviews of the article (should they wish to reveal their identity) as an accompanying commentary, for no additional fee. If reviewers know they could gain an additional publication for their efforts, this would motivate them to review more articles and respond in a constructive and timely fashion. Victoria Leong; orcid.org/0000-0003-0666-9445</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>[Provide] incentives for reviewing that encourages kind, open but fair responses; we would also be affecting a positive change in the culture of science; which will advance the science itself. Rebecca Gelding; orcid.org/0000-0003-4883-8075</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Reviews should be open, archived and after publication, reviewers should be revealed. This aims to ensure two aspects of quality control: reviewers take more seriously their job since it will be public with their name tag on it; and reviewing records can be used when considering career development. Juan Rocha; orcid.org/0000-0003-2322-5459</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Review record should also be one of the criteria judging and advancing a researcher’s professional development. Knowing that a reviewer’s identify would be revealed later and shared among peers, a reviewer would have more incentive to avoid giving low-quality comments. Xiao-Peng Song; orcid.org/0000-0002-5514-0321</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>A transparent, open review process may promote accountability among reviewers. A peer reviewer whose dated comments are published as supplementary material with the article has a greater incentive to conduct a thorough and timely review of the manuscript. These same published comments could also be accessed by other researchers who are struggling to address similar issues in their own studies. Sericea Stallings-Smith; orcid.org/0000-0002-4876-9965</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong>Slices of the Transparency Pie</strong></h4>
<p>Solutions that will help peer review achieve its scholarly ideal are not untenable; the challenge lies in that they must satisfy a diverse researcher and stakeholder community. While some improvements are easier to implement than others, even small slices that expedite and enrich the process of assessment in fundamentally new ways contribute to advancing science and discovery for the broader scientific community.</p>
<p>Publishers have an opportunity to improve both speed and efficiencies: to improve review forms that may be cumbersome or insufficient to provide thoughtful and constructive feedback to authors and to provide training for reviewers and editors that mitigate potential bias. Additional possibilities include direct or facilitated mentoring of early career researchers to improve their understanding of the principles of peer review and how it is practiced within the scientific community. Imagine the impact of a global editorial and reviewer contributor community, appropriately trained, recognized and incentivized.</p>

Instead of making scientists compete for grants based on project proposals, research funding could simply be divided equally among all 'qualified' researchers, according to a new paper.



Authors Krist Vaesen and Joel Katzav argue that such an 'egalitarian' distribution of funds would still leave each grant holder with enough money to support their work and pay for students and junior researchers. But I'm not sure I agree with their logic.

<p>These conditions include radiation; confinement in small, enclosed spaces with associated physical and psychological stressors; disrupted circadian rhythms; and, of course, microgravity. They take a toll on the human body, affecting vision, the musculoskeletal system, and the immune system.</p>
<p>Scientists at NASA are researching the risks associated with short and long duration space missions, such as spending more than six months on the ISS or – the next giant leap – a mission to Mars. A recent discovery by a team at NASA Johnson Space center suggests that one of these risks may not be as much of a problem as previously assumed.</p>
<p>Space flight anemia – the reduction of circulating red blood cells (RBCs) during time spent in space – is a generally accepted phenomenon. However, the majority of the studies examining changes to concentrations of red blood cells during spaceflight have been limited to evaluations of short-duration missions after astronauts had returned to earth.</p>
<p>The few evaluations made while astronauts were still in space have been conducted during short-duration flights, before the astronauts’ bodies had fully adapted to microgravity. Their findings may not accurately reflect what happens to red blood cells during long-duration flight.</p>
<p>In a <a href="https://bmchematol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12878-017-0083-y">study published this month</a> in <em><a href="https://bmchematol.biomedcentral.com/">BMC Hematology</a></em>, a team of researchers used living, whole blood samples collected from astronauts aboard the International Space Station.</p>
<p>Dr Richard Simpson, associate professor at The University of Arizona and the University of Houston, a co-author of the study explained: “This unique sample allowed us to track hematological parameters – such as concentrations of red blood cells (RBCs), hemoglobin or hematocrit – in astronauts on board the International Space Station <em>during</em> flight.”</p>
<blockquote><p>This is the first study to show that RBC concentrations and hematocrit remain at higher levels even after astronauts’ bodies have adapted to microgravity</p></blockquote>
<p>The samples were collected from 31 astronauts (six women and 25 men) who spent up to six months on the ISS. Blood was drawn at various time points before, during and after the astronauts’ time in space: at 180 and 45 days before they flew to the ISS, during their first two weeks in space, and approximately three and six months into the mission. The samples were sent to Earth within 48 hours of collection for analysis either in Houston or at Star City, Russia. Post-flight samples were collected three to eight hours after landing and 30 days after the mission had ended.</p>
<p>The researchers found that during space flight, concentrations of RBCs, platelets and the oxygen-carrying protein hemoglobin were higher compared to pre-flight levels. Hematocrit (the ratio of RBCs to the total volume of blood) also increased during space flight. While previous studies had shown this to be the case during the first few days of flight, this is the first study to show that RBC concentrations and hematocrit remain at higher levels even after astronauts’ bodies have adapted to microgravity.</p>
<p>Some of the changes observed in the in-flight blood samples were to be expected due to the 48-hour processing delay between sample collection and analysis (delays affect the concentration of various components of collected blood samples), but the changes in hematocrit during spaceflight were striking, according to the researchers.</p>
<p>Hematocrit had increased by 12.2%, 12.2% and 10.0% at early, mid, and late time points during space flight compared to pre-flight levels. However, only a 4.7% increase in hematocrit was observed in reference samples taken on earth from non-astronauts after the 48-hour processing delay. This suggests that the increases observed in the ISS samples are partly due to a true in-flight increase in RBC count. After the astronauts examined in this study returned to Earth, all blood parameters returned to pre-flight levels within 30 days.</p>
<p>The findings have to be interpreted within the context of the effects that microgravity has on body fluids, according to the study. For example, without the constant gravitational force that is present on Earth, fluids shift towards the head, resulting in a “puffy” face and a reduced leg volume.</p>
<p>Dr Simpson said: “Although the data does not indicate that significant anemia is present, it must be interpreted in the context of crew plasma volume during flight. Overall plasma volume has been shown to be reduced during spaceflight, but this has not been assessed during long-duration missions. In order to fully interpret the changes to RBC, hematocrit and other parameters observed in this study, further research into plasma volume during long space missions is needed.”</p>

<p><em>By</em> <a href="https://emmayoung.net/">Emma Young</a></p>
<p>Hallucinating voices isn’t always distressing. While the experience is commonly associated with schizophrenia, some people – an estimated 5 to 15 per cent of the general population – hear voices that aren’t real without finding it upsetting or debilitating  (they may even welcome it) and in the absence of any of the other symptoms of psychosis, such as delusions or confusion.</p>
<p>Now <a href="https://academic.oup.com/brain/article/doi/10.1093/brain/awx206/4085330/Distinct-processing-of-ambiguous-speech-in-people">new open-access research published in <em>Brain</em></a> has revealed a perceptual advantage for this group of people: they can detect hard-to-comprehend speech sounds more quickly and easily than people who have never hallucinated a voice.</p>
<p><span id="more-29871"></span></p>
<p>The study, led by Ben Alderson-Day at the University of Durham, involved twelve “non-clinical voice hearers” and 17 controls (matched for age, sex, handedness, education, and National Adult Reading Test scores) who do not hear voices. While their brains were scanned using fMRI, the volunteers listened to a series of so-called “sine-wave” speech recordings.</p>
<p>These recordings of spoken sentences – such as “The clown had a funny face” – were acoustically altered so that they were either totally unintelligible, or potentially intelligible. Initially, many people report that potentially intelligible sine-wave speech sounds like “aliens” or birdsong. But with training, it’s possible to recognise and understand the distorted words.</p>
<p>During the first part of the study, the volunteers had no idea that it was about speech perception. They were asked simply to press a button every time they heard a distinctive target sound. It was only after 20 minutes that they were asked if they’d noticed any words or sentences among the recordings they’d just listened to, and if so, to indicate when they had first noticed them and whether they had been able to understand any of them.</p>
<p>Nine out of 12 voice-hearers (75 per cent) said they’d realised words were contained in the sounds, compared with eight (47 per cent) of the non voice-hearers, and the voice-hearers noticed the words earlier, on average. Seven of the voice-hearers and five of the controls said they could understand the words, and five in each group could accurately recall some of them.</p>
<p>After this first 20-minute run, the volunteers were trained in how to listen for words in sine-wave speech. Then the trial was repeated, and, afterwards they were again queried about what they’d heard. For both groups, the training helped, but this time, the voice-hearers’ performance was no better than the controls.</p>
<p>Other work on people in the early stages of psychosis has found that they are <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26460044">better at identifying objects</a><b> </b>in an ambiguous visual scene than healthy controls, <i>if</i> they are primed about what to look for. Prior expectation seems to give them a superior ability – compared with controls – to spot genuine signals in noise.</p>
<p>In this study, being explicitly primed to listen for speech didn’t benefit the voice-hearers any more than the controls, so something different seems to be going on compared with the detection of visual patterns in psychosis.</p>
<p>The fMRI scans showed that, like the controls, the voice-hearers’ brains responded differently to potentially intelligible versus unintelligible sine-wave-speech. This suggests that voice-hearers aren’t biased to hear speech in any sound, but only when there is the possibility of a meaningful signal being present.</p>
<p>The scans also revealed a key difference between the brain activity of the voice-hearers and the controls. In both, the potentially intelligible recordings engaged the brain network typically active in normal voice processing, but the voice-hearers showed stronger responses to this kind of speech in two regions: the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex and the superior frontal gyrus (responses that were not seen when the recording was unintelligible).</p>
<p>“This suggests an enhanced involvement of attention and sensorimotor processes, selectively when speech was potentially intelligible,” the research team writes. “This suggests that the fundamental mechanisms underlying hallucination involve – and may develop from – ordinary perceptual processes, illustrating the continuity of mundane and unusual experience.”</p>
<p>This has implications for understanding the significant number of people who hallucinate voices but do not need psychiatric care. It also feeds in to the idea that, within the general population, there’s a <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11702510">continuum of experiences normally associated – in their extremes – with psychosis</a>.</p>

                <h4><a href="http://brainblogger.com/2017/09/11/trans-from-the-moment-of-birth/">Trans — From the Moment of Birth</a></h4>

<p>The moment I was born, the doctor looked at my nether regions, saw a penis, and announced to my parents, “It’s a boy”. Along with that announcement came a long list of expectations about how a boy’s life should unfold in rural Nebraska in the 1940s and ’50s. No ambiguity. No nuance. Boys will be boys—or else!</p>
<p><a href="http://brainblogger.com/2009/06/21/time-for-a-change-gender-reassignment/">Gender</a> reveal parties are a hot trend among today’s expectant parents.<sup>1</sup> At about twenty weeks of gestation, an ultrasound is completed, and family and friends are called together for “the reveal,” a celebration of the newly identified biologic sex of the child. Sometimes a baby-carriage-piñata filled with candy is struck until the candy, wrapped in either pink or blue, comes rolling out—along with all the expectations about gender roles that will be established even prior to birth.</p>
<p>Although it could be confusing to guests, I think those parties might better be called “sex reveal parties,” but I understand that guests might come with a different set of expectations. You see, what is being revealed isn’t gender at all but the biological sex of the child. Sex and gender are not the same, although they are often confused and the terms used interchangeably.</p>
<p>Humans have a natural tendency to categorize, sometimes out of respect, sometimes based on stereotypes. At birth, infants are assigned a sex by a third party. It’s a binary choice based on their external genitalia or, in some cases, by chromosomes. Sex is binary: boy or girl. Gender is more of a psychological and societal concept. Gender is not binary; it may not even be linear. Enter the world of the transgender. (A discussion of intersex children who may have incomplete physical characteristics is beyond the scope of this article.)</p>
<p>Transgender individuals are those who identify with a gender that differs from the biological sex they were assigned at birth. They are born biologically male or female but express their gender in ways more consistent with the opposite sex.</p>
<p>Although it may seem like we have a wave of newly identified transgender people, the percent of trans people remains consistent at about 0.3%, and rather than a change in incidence, we are likely experiencing more visibility. While interviewing me, MJ Schwader said that he first came out as a lesbian at age nineteen and only many years later came out as a transgender man. He said:</p>
<blockquote><p>Something wasn’t right; even without language around it, I knew from a very early age that I wasn’t going to be able to stay there. When I came to a realization that I was trans, there was this complete peace inside.<sup>2</sup></p></blockquote>
<p>Whether speaking of sexual orientation or gender orientation, many people live in a kind of purgatory of sexual confusion until they acquire the words to describe their individual identity.</p>
<p>Another layer of confusion is added when considering “drag,” that is practiced by people of all sexual orientations and gender identities. The term “drag” is used when someone wears clothing that is more conventionally worn by a person of the opposite sex, especially when a man wears women’s clothes. Drag is a performance; it does not refer to people who wish to assume a gender different from their assigned sex. Transgender women want to dress as women because they are women, transgender men are men.</p>
<p>One morning I heard a television pundit who opposes transgender rights say that if men can gain an advantage by saying they are women, many will do so. He was wrong on so many levels. In our patriarchal society, most would agree that not many advantages accrue to women over men. He also implied that all a man had to do was put on a dress and a wig and suddenly he is transformed into a woman. His statement ignores the complexities and pain of a trans person’s decision to transition to a different gender. Some trans people work hard to leave no doubt as to the gender they believe they are.</p>
<p>When a conflict exists between one’s biological sex and the gender with which one identifies, it creates gender dysphoria, a clinically significant form of distress. A report titled “Suicide Attempts among Transgender and Gender Non-Conforming Adults” states that over 40% of trans men and women have attempted suicide, with the prevalence being highest among the young, economically disadvantaged, less educated, and ethnic minorities.<sup>3</sup></p>
<p>Until a recent change in the <em>Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of the American Psychiatric Association</em>, this condition was labeled “gender dysphoria disorder.” Although trans men and women experience dysphoria (anxiety, <a href="http://brainblogger.com/2016/10/08/new-target-in-brain-for-treating-depression-the-bmp-pathway/">depression</a>, and suicidal thoughts) at a higher rate than the general population, it is no longer considered a “disorder.” For many, their psychiatric symptoms disappear or markedly diminish once they have decided to transition to the gender with which they identify.</p>
<p>Why would anyone, then, choose to assume a gender different from the biological sex with which they were born? Many studies on the causes of transsexuality have been widely discredited, particularly psychological studies. A recent review of literature on the causes of gender identity concluded that a fixed, biologic basis exists for gender identity and that the best clinical outcomes are associated with hormone therapy and surgical sexual transition.<sup>4</sup></p>
<p>One classic way for scientists to test whether a trait is influenced by genetics is twin studies. Identical twins have the same chromosomes; fraternal twins are raised in the same environment but share only half their genes. Several studies have shown that among twins, both identical twins are transgender more often than both fraternal twins. Studies of the brain structure have also shown that the brains of transgender males or females are more similar to the brains of the sex with which these people identify than the brains of the sex they were assigned at birth.<sup>5</sup></p>
<p>Transgender identity is complex. It is not binary; it may not be linear. It is also most certainly not a capricious choice made to seek a particular advantage. It may also be more fluid than once thought. Sex and gender are most likely a matrix of identities without one precise set of causes. The most promising choices for understanding transsexualism is in <a href="http://brainblogger.com/2015/06/11/epigenetics-and-its-major-influence-on-life/">epigenomics</a>, a study that combines the effects of the environment on genetic expression.</p>
<p>More than one in four trans people has faced a bias-driven assault, and rates are higher for trans women and trans people of color.<sup>6</sup> Although more than half of Americans oppose laws requiring transgender people to use bathrooms that correspond to their birth sex, the current political environment is a very difficult one for transgender men and women. “Bathroom bills” have become the focal point of anti-LGBT measures across the country. In most cases, bathroom bills have been proposed by politicians up for re-election. The bills are being used to energize these politicians’ conservative base now that the issue of same-sex marriage has been resolved, and the arguments that they are using are the same that were used against same-sex marriage—for example, to protect children.</p>
<p>President Trump, indebted to conservative Christians, has reversed his pre-election position and has rescinded <a href="http://brainblogger.com/2016/06/04/making-the-president-disappear-the-inattentional-barack-obama-blindness-illusion/">President Obama</a>’s rule that trans people must be allowed to use the bathroom consistent with the sex with which they identify. In an administration that so easily dismisses science, the evidence that transsexualism is biologically determined will have little impact.</p>
<p>We have a great deal to learn about transsexualism. For example, we know that the earlier hormonal treatment is given, the more apparent the physical transformation will be, but what are the long-term consequences of putting children on hormones with irreversible effects?</p>
<p>One thing we can be certain of is this: issues of sexual orientation and gender identification are complex and will not be resolved at a gender reveal party during the twentieth week of gestation.</p>

<p>Even the most scientifically trained among us have <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2012/11/22/the-unscientific-thinking-that-forever-lingers-in-the-minds-of-physics-professors/">an instinct for mystical thinking</a> – seeing purpose in nature, for example, or reading meaning in random coincidences. Psychologists think this is to do with the way our minds work at a fundamental level. We have evolved to be highly attuned to concepts relevant to our social lives, things like intentions and fairness. And we just can’t switch off this way of thinking, even when we’re contemplating the physical world.</p>
<p>Among other things, this may explain the intuitive appeal of the Buddhist and Hindu notion of karmic justice – the idea, essentially, that you get what you deserve in life; that the cosmos rewards those who do good (variations of this idea are also spread by other religions). Indeed, in a <a href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/desc.12442/abstract?campaign=woletoc">new paper</a> in <em>Developmental Science</em>, psychologists at Yale University have shown that children in the US as young as four are inclined to believe in, and actively seek, karmic justice, regardless of whether they come from a religious family or not.</p>
<p>“We conclude that, beginning early in development, children expect that life events are not purely random occurrences, but instead that they happen for an intended reason, such as rewarding people for their good behaviour,” said the study authors Konika Banerjee and Paul Bloom.</p>
<p><span id="more-29776"></span></p>
<p>In one experiment, 20 children aged four to six, tested alone, were told that if a completely random coin shake landed the right way up they would get a super cool glow-in-the-dark water wiggle toy. Then they were given some stickers to say thanks for taking part. Before the coin was shaken, they were told about two other kids doing the same challenge, one of whom gave his stickers away to needy children because he thought this would increase his chances of winning the toy; the other child threw her stickers in the bin because she thought this would increase her winning chances. Each participant was asked which child they thought was correct, and then they were given the chance to copy their actions (there was a donation box and a bin in the testing room).</p>
<p>Overall, the participating children expressed a belief in the karmic strategy (giving stickers away to needy children would boost their own chances of winning the toy), certainly much more than they believed in the rubbish bin strategy. Moreover, of the 45 per cent of the kids who tried out a strategy for themselves, nearly all of them tried the karmic strategy (only one child tried the rubbish bin strategy). This bias for believing in karma was true regardless of whether the children were from a religious family or not.</p>
<p>In a second experiment, 40 more children (aged five to six) were shown cartoon vignettes about other children trying to achieve something (e.g. a girl trying to find her lost puppy), and who used different strategies to boost their chances, either involving karmic bargaining (e.g. being friendly to a new girl at school), or a non-karmic strategy (e.g. making her hair shorter).</p>
<p>For each vignette, two different fictional characters gave their opposing verdicts on the  likely effectiveness of the karmic strategy. For instance one character said that being friendly to a new girl would help find the puppy because if you do something nice, it helps something nice happen to you. The other character was sceptical – yes, it is nice to do something kind for someone else but that doesn’t help make some unrelated good thing happen to you.</p>
<p>The participating children were asked which character they thought was right and they far more often endorsed the character who was in favour of the effectiveness of the karmic strategy. A further control condition showed this wasn’t simply because of a generic bias for causal explanations (where any one thing is said to cause another), but was specifically for karma-related causal strategies where doing something nice increases the odds of an unrelated favourable outcome occurring for oneself. Again, the children’s belief in karma was unrelated to whether they came from a religious background or not.</p>
<p>One final experimental with four- to six-year-old kids clarified things a little further, showing that young children tend to have a rather “diffuse” notion of karma – that is, they think the odds of something nice happening to them is increased not only by their doing something nice themselves, but also by someone else doing good in the world.</p>
<p>Banerjee and Bloom think young children’s belief in cosmic karma is probably an extension of their early belief in social karma – the generally accurate notion that if you do someone a favour, they are likely to reciprocate in due course. In other words, it’s another example of the way that we “overextend inferences and expectations from the social domain to the non-social domain” (similar to how we so readily attribute meaning and purpose to the inanimate world, such as thinking that trees make oxygen so that animals can breathe).</p>
<p>The researchers added: “Taken together, our findings support the view that notions of karma may be so cross-culturally successful because they capitalise on certain more generally social-cognitive propensities and heuristics for navigating our social relationships that are present and active early in development.”</p>

<p>You are standing in the middle of King’s Cross with a postcode in your hands, your feet trodden on by the busy crowd. So much has changed since you were last here 20 years ago, and every way you go seems to meet frowning faces set in their own path. By a lucky coincidence, somebody recognizes you and shakes your hand—they are going the same way. What are the odds! “Thank you”, you mutter, “you are a star”.</p>
<p><strong>Through thistles and thorns</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://brainblogger.com/2014/09/09/spinal-cord-injury-and-wearable-robotics/">Spinal cord injury</a> (SCI) leaves patients isolated from their own bodies with devastating life-long consequences. The limited nature of adult human spinal cord repair is frustrating but understandable from a developmental point of view. If fasciculis gracilis, a tract of the spinal cord responsible for lower limb sensations that relays touch from the foot, gets traumatically disrupted, the dorsal root ganglion (DRG) cell axon would not only have to cross over the site of injury, but also find the correct path all the way up—up to 50 cm in a tall individual. Even if that tremendous task is accomplished, there still remains the challenge of finding the correct second order neuron of the nucleus gracilis that, in turn, connects to the third order thalamic neuron transmitting signals to the part of the somatosensory cortex representing that foot. Not something that can be easily done without help.</p>
<p><strong>On the way to connectivity restoration</strong></p>
<p>It has been noted that: </p>
<blockquote><p>The three main aims of [axon regeneration] research are: to initiate and maintain axonal growth and elongation; to direct regenerating axons to reconnect with their target neurons; and to reconstitute original circuitry (or the equivalent), which will ultimately lead to functional restoration. Although many interventions have now been reported to promote functional recovery after experimental SCI, none has fulfilled all three of these aims. In fact, only the first aim has been extensively studied and convincingly demonstrated.</p></blockquote>
<p>Indeed, even though the possibility of axon regrowth in the adult mammalian nervous system has been shown, the evidence supporting <a href="http://brainblogger.com/2016/02/05/a-virtual-brain-the-benefits-of-brain-modelling/">neuronal connectivity</a> restoration is rarely convincing. Without careful guidance, aberrant axonal regrowth is a serious obstacle to functional regeneration.</p>
<p>Interestingly, long-distance regeneration of axons is not the only mechanism through which normal spinal cord function can be restored. Injury is known to induce plasticity by several mechanisms including unmasking inactive spared pathways, compensatory collateral sprouting from the intact pathways, or an increase in receptor number due to denervation hypersensitivity.. For example, Hofstetter et al. commented that:</p>
<blockquote><p>Excessive local sprouting in our present study might have facilitated the formation of [novel corticospinal tract] pathways, although we could not detect a correlation between the amount of local sprouting and motor recovery.</p></blockquote>
<p>Whilst researchers are trying to find a way to artificially guide axons to their correct targets and induce <a href="http://brainblogger.com/2015/05/02/how-does-meditation-make-you-smarter/">plasticity</a>, there is a cell type that routinely orchestrates these processes. Astrocytes express a range of axon-attractive and repulsive molecules that are crucial for proper development and adult nervous system plastic reorganisation. They provide a physical adherent substrate for growing neurons, secrete extracellular neuro-attractants like vimentin and repellents like chondroitin sulphate proteoglycans (CSPGs) and semaphorins.</p>
<p><strong>A scar or a star?</strong></p>
<p>The neurocentric paradigm considered astrocytes to be a barrier to healing after the SCI for almost a century despite the lack of evidence that purely neuron-based therapies are sufficient for full regeneration. However, if the derogatory-dubbed astrocytic scar is removed or prevented from forming in the SCI context, not only do axons fail to spontaneously regrow through the lesion, they also become unable to regrow upon delivery of stimulating growth factors that promote growth in the presence of astrocytes.</p>
<p>Anderson et al. show that <a href="http://brainblogger.com/2012/02/03/the-many-emerging-roles-of-astrocytes/">astrocytes</a> are not responsible for the bulk of the inhibitory CSPG production after the SCI lesion, as hypothesized previously, but instead provide crucial axon-supporting molecules. The injury environment primes reactive astrocytes to re-express developmental synaptogenic molecules such as thrombospondin-1 that result in protective neuroplasticity.</p>
<p><strong>Not all are created equal</strong></p>
<p>Despite these recent discoveries, skepticism towards astrocyte-based therapies prevails. To exacerbate this view, several studies that used <a href="http://brainblogger.com/2017/08/28/the-gut-brain-connection-and-enterochromaffin-cells/">neural stem cell</a> (NSC) transplantation in an attempt to repair spinal cord damage observed neuropathic pain development that correlates with the astrocytic differentiation of NSCs. </p>
<p>Nevertheless, it is becoming clear that the astrocytic population is far from homogeneous. Subsets of astrocytes with different permissive and restrictive qualities towards the growth of specific types of axons are found within different regions of the spinal cord that guide region-specific development of sensory and motor axonal tracts. Not surprisingly, certain astrocytic types are more selective towards regeneration and plasticity of specific types of neurons.</p>
<p>Davies at al. have discovered that astrocytes pre-differentiated from embryonic glial-restricted precursors (GRPs) (GRP-derived astrocytes or GDAs) are capable of promoting axonal regrowth alongside functional recovery and prevention of axotomized neuron atrophy upon <a href="http://brainblogger.com/2015/06/28/neuronal-transplantation-may-restore-brain-functionality/">transplantation</a> in rodents with SCI, where this method supersedes transplantation of undifferentiated neural precursors.</p>
<p>Importantly, the method of astrocytic differentiation of precursor cells plays a crucial role in determining their regenerative capacity. If bone morphogenic protein-4 (BMP4) is used in GDA astrogenesis, the resulting population creates a strongly supportive environment upon transplantation. In contrast, the same GRPs treated with ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF) have poor locomotor regenerative properties, but induce active calcitonin-gene-related peptide (CGRP)-positive nociceptive c-fiber sprouting that is associated with allodynia.</p>
<p>This raises the possibility that the inflammatory environment of the injured spinal cord promotes differentiation of endogenous and transplanted astrocytes into the subtype that is not optimal for rubrospinal or dorsal column tract axon restoration, but, in turn, may be selectively supportive to pain-conducting c-fibers.</p>
<p>In addition to transplantation strategies, modification of endogenous astrocyte function can be employed. For example, oral administration of denosomin results in functional recovery in mice after SCI through increases in astrocyte proliferation, survival, and vimentin secretion that promotes locomotor raphespinal axon outgrowth.</p>
<p><strong>Learning from the experts</strong></p>
<p>Finally, it is noteworthy that astrocytic subtypes that promote recovery appear to physically realign local astrocytic processes in a linear fashion. Authors speculate that this linear organization provides more straightforward routes for regenerating axons to follow. Another exciting and unexplored possibility is that these astrocytes help to restore the endogenous astrocytic network function that gets disrupted by the injury, whilst beneficial <a href="http://brainblogger.com/2017/07/03/rna-storage-in-neurons-contributes-to-brain-plasticity/">neuroplasticity</a> is its natural corollary.</p>
<p>Stepping back from the exclusively neurocentric view of SCI may allow for unexpected advances in functional restoration. Ultimately, the bulk of research on the intricacies of axonal guidance and plastic synapse rearrangement is an attempt at recapitulation of normal astrocytic functions. When offered a helping hand, take it, and see where it leads you.</p>

<h3><strong>What is your profession?</strong></h3>
<p>I am a researcher at the Ethology unit, University of Valencia.</p>
<h3><strong>What type of research are you involved in?</strong></h3>
<p>My research line combines experimental and phylogenetic approaches and encompasses both ecological and evolutionary studies focused on investigating those traits employed by animals to engage in social and sexual interactions and their role in lineages diversification and species adaptations. Specifically, I am currently investigating at the University of Valencia (at Pau Carazo´s Lab) the mechanisms inherent to sexual conflict and the ecological factors that modulate this event.</p>
<h3><strong>Why did you become interested in this area of research?</strong></h3>
<p>I have always been interested in the process and mechanism underlying animal ecology and evolution and thus, my way has moved forward progressively, building this interesting framework of study in which I am involved in.</p>
<h3><strong>How did you become interested in photography?</strong></h3>
<p>My life cannot be understood without animals and hence, the best way to “capture” them and wear them always with you is with photography. They will be with you in photography forever.</p>
<h3><strong>Where and how was this photo taken? Why were you there at the time?</strong></h3>
<p>This picture was taken while I was walking with my dog in Valencia. I often observe snails, grasshoppers, lizards, and that time I could see that special interaction among three animals. I went to my house to take the camera and took several photos of what was happening in this interesting interaction.</p>
<h3><strong>Can you explain a bit more about the image?</strong></h3>
<p>In field work, you often see, with luck and effort, spiders hunting or even eating their prey. However, this case was special because a third protagonist appeared in the scene. This small fly was parasitizing the bee while it was being eaten by the spider.</p>
<h3><strong>What about this scene particularly interested you?</strong></h3>
<p>In my opinion, this scene reflects life from 3 different perspectives and show how complex are animal interactions. It shows mimicry with the crab spider, it shows the dangers underlying pollination for bees, it shows three different positions on the trophic web (predators, prey and parasites) and finally, the image highlights how connected are many animals in a dynamic in which the loss of some of them in a hypothetical region could trigger crucial consequences for other species in that region.</p>

<img alt="" class="attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image" height="110" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2017/09/National-Suicide-Prevention-Jared-Keener-Flickr-CC-140x110.jpg" style="display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;" width="140" /><p> </p>
<p>The World Health Organization estimates that over <a href="http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs398/en/">800,000 people die by suicide each year</a> – that is one person every 40 seconds! But for every suicide, there are many more people who attempt suicide, and many individuals who are impacted by the suicide of a loved one. Suicide is not restricted by age, gender, nationality or income; it occurs throughout the lifespan and in 2015, was the second leading cause of death among 15–29-year-olds. A prior suicide attempt is the single most important risk factor for suicide in the general population, and whilst people with mental health conditions are at higher risk of suicide, many suicides occur spontaneously in response to life events or crisis.</p>
<p>Suicide is a serious public health concern and is preventable. In 2014, the World Health Organization published “<a href="http://www.who.int/mental_health/suicide-prevention/world_report_2014/en/">Preventing suicide: a global imperative</a>”, it’s first global report to increase awareness of suicide and suicide attempts, and to make suicide prevention a global public health priority. Suicide is a complex issue and therefore effective suicide prevention efforts require multiple constituents. One critical component to suicide prevention is the early identification of those in need, to ensure that they receive appropriate care and support; this is where the social support provided by communities and loved ones can be so vital to a vulnerable individual seeking mental health care.</p>
<p>Access to appropriate mental health care, when and where it is needed, is vital for the prevention of suicide. In some countries mental health care may be harder to access due to geographical or financial restraints. However, even in countries where access to care is ready available many who experience suicidal ideation do not seek help. A number of barriers may prevent those experiencing suicidal ideation from seeking treatment; suicide and mental illness are still heavily stigmatized in many communities, and some groups of the general population are less likely to seek help than others, including young people and men.</p>
<figure class="wp-caption alignright" id="attachment_9486" style="width: 310px;"><img alt="" class="size-medium wp-image-9486" height="200" src="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2017/09/Dropbox-Johan-Larsson-Flickt-CC-300x200.jpg" width="300" /><div class="attachment-image--caption">Johan Larsson, Flickr, CC</div><div class="attachment-image--source"></div></figure>
<p>Increasing global reliance on technology allows for opportunities to improve mental health care provision; the potential for those who cannot, or choose not to, access traditional ‘face-to-face’ healthcare to be reached by digital methods is possible. To date, this has taken many forms – from doctor-patient consultations via video calling, to the development of sophisticated online and mobile telephone applications. Research examining the effectiveness of digital or eHealth interventions for both preventative treatment and follow-up care is rapidly expanding.</p>
<p>A  systematic review and meta-analysis, <a href="https://bmcpsychiatry.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12888-017-1458-0">recently published</a> in <em>BMC Psychiatry</em> by <a href="http://monash.edu/research/explore/en/persons/katrina-witt%289a5e2239-c431-43cb-aa45-cb74096b4056%29.html">Katrina Witt</a> and colleagues from Monash University, Australia, examined the effectiveness of digital interventions for the self-management of suicidal ideation or self-harm. The researchers analyzed data from 14 published studies including a total of 3,356 participants. Most of the studies included evaluated online interventions, but two examined mobile phone applications that were designed for people suffering from depression/suicidal-ideation to self-manage their symptoms. The researchers found that despite limitations with many of the published studies design, there is some evidence that digital interventions may be associated with reductions in suicidal ideation.</p>
<p>Another systematic review and meta-analysis, by <a href="https://med.unsw.edu.au/people/mr-mark-deady">Mark Deady</a> and colleagues from the University of New South Wales and the Black Dog Institute (Australia), <a href="https://bmcpsychiatry.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12888-017-1473-1">recently published</a> in <em>BMC Psychiatry</em>, evaluated the effectiveness of eHealth interventions for the prevention of depression and anxiety. The researchers analyzed data from 10 published randomized controlled trials, including a total of 4,522 participants. The studies included evaluated online and mobile phone applications, but also other intervention methods such as those using email and/or text messaging to provide support. The review suggests that a range of eHealth intervention programs produce small, but positive, effects on symptom reduction for anxiety and depression in the general population.</p>
<p>In both of these reviews the intervention programs were developed by psychologists/psychiatrists using aspects of cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), and were found to be beneficial compared with control conditions. However, it should be emphasized that in all studies there is lack of long-term follow up data, and it is therefore unclear whether these interventions may translate to reduced suicide attempts, depression and anxiety in the longer term. The small numbers of studies in both reviews indicate the continuing need to rigorously evaluate the effectiveness of eHealth interventions; despite the ever increase number of digital programs and apps available that are designed to improve and promote mental wellbeing, a clear distinction needs to be made between those designed with a basis in evidence based medicine, such as the studies analyzed here, and those that are not.</p>
<p>eHealth and digital interventions have the potential to reach more people with fewer resources than face-to face care, and may be useful in breaking down some of the current barriers that prevent those in need from accessing mental health care.</p>

<p><em>By guest blogger</em> <a href="https://mariannecezza.wordpress.com/">Marianne Cezza</a></p>
<p>As social creatures, accurately recognising and understanding the mental states of others (their intentions, knowledge, beliefs, etc.) is crucial to our social bonds and interactions. In fact, in today’s multi-cultural world and strongly divided political climate, this skill – known as Theory of Mind – is perhaps more important than ever. A recent <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s41465-017-0023-6">study</a> published in the <i>Journal of Cognitive Enhancement</i> proposes that an effective way to develop our Theory of Mind lies in learning to better understand ourselves.</p>
<p><span id="more-29764"></span></p>
<p>Anne Böckler and colleagues, based at the Max Planck Institute for Human Cognitive and Brain Sciences in Leipzig, recruited 141 participants to take part in a three-month long contemplative training course that teaches people to take the perspective of the different aspects of their own personalities.</p>
<p>Before they started, the participants completed a test of their Theory of Mind: they watched short video clips of people describing autobiographical events, then answered a questionnaire about the storyteller’s intentions, thoughts and goals.</p>
<p>Next, the participants were taught to identify and label six ‘inner parts’ or sub-personalities within themselves, for example ‘the caring part’, ‘the inner happy child’, ‘the vulnerable part’. They could modify or add to this list at any time during the training course.</p>
<p>The course itself consisted of two key components that the participants practised daily for thirty minutes, and at a two-hour guided weekly training sessions. The first component was an ‘observing-thoughts’ meditation, in which participants observed their thoughts objectively,  de-identified from them (i.e. observed them in a detached way), then classified the thoughts into categories of me/other, past/future or positive/negative. The second component was a perspective-taking exercise which participants conducted in pairs, alternating between the role of speaker and listener. The speaker recounted an event from their day from the perspective of one of their randomly selected inner parts. Aware of the speaker’s various inner parts, the listener had to guess which one was talking.</p>
<p>These perspective-taking exercises and the concept of ‘inner parts’ are based on the Internal Family Systems (IFS) model; an approach used in psychotherapy. The model sees an individual’s personality as made up of different sub-personalities, each with its own set of behaviours, cognitions and affects.  The current study is part of a larger research project which draws from the model’s principles, successfully implemented in a therapeutic setting (such as <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23950186">with rheumatoid arthritis patients</a>), and applies them to a non-clinical, healthy, adult population with the aim of improving mental well-being and social intelligence.</p>
<p>On average, the participants in the current study identified 11 inner parts to their personalities, of which 44 per cent were labelled by independent judges as negative traits and 56 per cent were positive traits. The researchers organised the participants’ different personality parts into related trait types according to the IFS model, the most common being: Protectors (12 per cent), Managers and Pleasure Parts (both 11 per cent), Inner Critics (9 per cent), and Vulnerable Parts (8 per cent).</p>
<p>After completing the training course the participants re-took the same Theory of Mind test that they’d taken at the start of the study. Improvement in Theory of Mind was correlated with the number of different inner personality parts identified – the more facets the participants were able to recognise within themselves, the better they seemed to become at understanding others. This is reflected in <a href="http://bit.ly/2gDnXvv">neuroimaging</a> <a href="http://bit.ly/2wCOd20">research</a>, where the processes of perspective-taking of the self and others utilise shared neural mechanisms.</p>
<p>Interestingly, the correlation between number of parts of self identified and improvement in Theory of Mind was even stronger in those who identified more negative parts. The researchers propose that this supports the theory that people are naturally resistant to looking for negative aspects of their personality, therefore those who do are thought to be working more profoundly to better understand themselves. In addition to the result of a better understanding of the mental states of others, this deeper work also improves psychological wellbeing, as it is widely acknowledged in clinical psychology that accepting negative emotions is beneficial to mental health.</p>
<p>The purpose of identifying the different aspects of our personalities is to understand that through them one can view a single situation through a handful of different outlooks; we learn to see the self as multifaceted and can detach and de-identify from one sole personal perspective. Consequently, we’ll also be more open to the different points of view of others, and less likely to assume that a person’s perspective remains consistent across different life situations. It’s likely this increased interpersonal understanding will in turn encourage greater respect and compassion for others, facilitate communication and reduce the ostracism and stigmatisation of groups with alternative outlooks.</p>
<p>So it seems a little soul searching is required to better understand the people around us. Why not have a go at reflecting on your own psyche, and see what you can recognise in others?</p>

                <h4><a href="http://romainbrette.fr/tip-for-new-pis-always-do-administrative-work-at-the-last-minute-or-later/">Tip for new PIs : always do administrative work at the last minute, or later</a></h4>

<p>This is a tip that has taken me years to really grasp, and I still haven't fully internalized it. I don't like to work at the last minute. If I have something to do and I don't do it, then it stays in the back of my mind until I do it. So, especially if it's some boring task like administrative work, I like to get rid of it as soon as possible. That's a mistake. I'm speaking of my experience in France, so maybe it doesn't apply so much elsewhere. The reason it's a mistake is that what you are required to do changes all the time, so the latest you do it, the least work you will have to do.</p>
<p>Every new politician seems to want to add a new layer of bureaucracy, independently of their political origin, so the amount of administrative work you are required to do as a scientist keeps growing, and it doesn't seem to converge. But setting up new rules and reglementations in a complex bureaucratic monster is not easy, so the monster often outputs nonsensical forms and requirements. One example in France is the evaluation of labs (<a href="http://www.hceres.fr/">HCERES</a>), whose role is unclear and changing. The amount of redundancy and the absurdity of some requirements is abysmal. For example, you are required to fill a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SWOT_analysis">SWOT diagram</a>, to select and list 20 % of all your « outputs », but also to list each one of them in another form, etc. Because many of the requirements are vague and nonsensical, any organization that deals with them will take some time to converge to a clear set of rules issued to the labs. I have written my evaluation document about 4 times because of the changing instructions.</p>
<p>Another recent example is the new evaluation system set up by INSERM (national medical research institution). Someone there (external consulting company ?) apparently decided that having an online CV with fields to fill instead of uploading a text would be more convenient. So for example you have to insert, one by one in web forms, the list of all journals for which you have reviewed in your entire career, and how many papers you have reviewed for each of them. You need to insert the list of all students you have supervised in you entire carrier, with names and exact dates, etc, all one by one in separate fields. Imagine that for senior PIs. Guess what : one week before deadline, the requirement of filling that CV was lifted for most scientists because of many complaints (a bit too late for most of them, including me). About a quarter of them still have to, but the message says that the format of the CV will change next year since it was not good, so all the work will basically be for nothing.</p>
<p>So here is my conclusion and tip : bureaucracy is nonsense and don't assume otherwise ; just set yourself some time on the deadline to do the required work, whatever it might become at that time (and it might disappear).</p>
