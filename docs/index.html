<p>My core values are intelligence, growth and freedom.</p>
<p>most people really underestimate their brain power, but as for me I believe I can do anything I put my mind to! I wanna know more, explore and grow! </p>
<p>That’s where growth comes in, I value growth even in the smallest scale as long as you are making progress and not giving up !</p>
<p>And lastly freedom! I believe everyone should be free to practice whatever, go into any field of choice as long as no one is getting hurt!</p>
<p>When I heard about outreachy, an internship that welcomes total beginners that was a very good motivation and the stipends?? Free mentoring from professionals? This was definitely my chance to broaden my scope.</p>
<p>You should definitely apply for the next round.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/ingenuity-helicopter-flying-mars-perseverance-nasa">Ingenuity is still flying on Mars. Here’s what the helicopter is up to</a></h4>

              
                <p>The Ingenuity Mars helicopter was never supposed to last this long. NASA engineers built and tested the first self-powered aircraft to fly on another planet to answer a simple question: Could the helicopter fly at all? The goal was to take five flights in 30 Martian days or break the aircraft trying.</p>



<p>But more than 120 Martian days past that experiment window, Ingenuity is still flying and doing things no one ever expected. The helicopter, which <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/nasa-ingenuity-helicopter-first-flight-mars-perseverance-rover">took its first flight on April 19</a>, is breaking its own records for distance and speed (<em>SN: 4/19/21</em>). It’s helping the <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/mars-how-watch-nasa-perseverance-lander-touch-down">Perseverance rover explore Jezero crater</a>, near an ancient river delta that may hold signs of past Martian life (<em>SN: 2/17/21</em>). And Ingenuity is coping with changing seasons and navigating over rough terrain, two things that the flier wasn’t designed to do.</p>



<p>“It’s gotten into a good groove,” says Ingenuity’s original chief engineer Bob Balaram NASA’s Jet Propulsion Lab in Pasadena, Calif. “It’s in its element and having fun.”</p>



<p>Here’s what Ingenuity has been up to on Mars.</p>





<h4>Testing the limits</h4>



<p>Ingenuity is flying farther, faster and higher than it did in its first few flights. The helicopter has lifted itself a maximum of 12 meters above the Martian surface, zipped along at up to five meters per second (about half as fast as record-setting sprinter Florence Griffith-Joyner) and covered 625 meters (about a third the length of the Kentucky Derby) in a single flight. These extremes give engineers valuable information about the limits of flying on Mars.</p>



<p>“We are still trying to learn lessons,” says JPL robotics engineer Teddy Tzanetos, a team leader for the Ingenuity mission. “Flight after flight, we’re learning the boundaries of performance.”</p>

</div><figcaption>The Ingenuity craft is now flying over untested, rough Martian terrain. During the helicopter’s 13th flight, on September 4, Ingenuity (indicated with the white circle in the video above) took pictures of a rocky outcrop from multiple angles. NASA’s Perseverance rover filmed the flight.</figcaption></figure>



<p>Early on, Ingenuity tested its limits in a way that the flight team really didn’t plan for. During its sixth flight on May 22, the helicopter’s navigation system suffered a glitch that made it roll and sway alarmingly.</p>



<p>The helicopter’s navigation software keeps track of the craft’s position by taking an image, reading the time stamp on that image and predicting what the camera should see next based on landmarks from previous photos that Ingenuity took. If the next image doesn’t match that prediction, the software corrects the helicopter’s position and velocity to match up better.</p>



<p>Less than a minute into the May 22 flight, a single image got lost on its way from Ingenuity’s cameras to its onboard computer. That meant that the time stamps on all subsequent images were a little off. In trying to correct what it perceived as errors, Ingenuity “went on a wild joyride,” Balaram says.</p>



<p>Luckily, the helicopter touched down safely within five meters of its intended landing spot. The anomaly was a blessing in disguise, Balaram says. It put the helicopter through extremes of movement — “how aggressively you can move the joystick, if you will” — that the engineers would not have asked it to do on purpose, and did perfectly fine, he says.</p>



<p>“It’s a serendipitous thing that we got that flight experience under our belt,” Balaram says. “We have much more confidence in the vehicle.”</p>



<h4>Doing science</h4>



<p>Originally, the helicopter team wanted to push the vehicle until it broke. But now the researchers are flying more cautiously and less often. That’s because the helicopter is currently <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/nasa-ingenuity-helicopter-mission-extended-mars-perseverance">supporting the Perseverance rover</a> in doing science (<em>SN: 4/30/21</em>).</p>



<p>“We’re no longer in the Month of Ingenuity,” Tzanetos says. “We’re a small part of a much larger team.”</p>



<p>The helicopter has already proven its worth by telling the rover where not to go. Ingenuity’s ninth flight, on July 5, took the helicopter over a dune field called South Séítah that would have been difficult for the rover to drive through safely. Then, Ingenuity photographed some rock outcrops and raised ridges in South Séítah that had looked interesting in images taken from an orbiting spacecraft. Scientists thought those ridges could record some of the deepest water environments in the lake that filled the crater long ago.</p>

<p>In 3-D images from the helicopter, it turned out that those ridges did not show the layers that would have indicated that the rocks formed in deep water. The rover team decided to move on, saving Perseverance a long, arduous and potentially dangerous drive.</p>



<p>“They didn’t have to send the rover all the way to this particular target, and then realize, hey, this may not be the highest priority thing,” Balaram says.</p>



<p>Scouting for the rover has also taken Ingenuity over terrain that the helicopter wasn’t designed to understand. Ingenuity’s navigation software was programmed to assume that the ground beneath it is always flat because that was the type of terrain selected for that experimental first month of flight demonstrations.</p>



<p>“It was a perfectly reasonable simplification for a technology demonstration,” Balaram says. “But it was baked in. And now you’re stuck with a system with a flat ground assumption.”</p>



<p>When the helicopter is flying over a sloped surface, some features seem to move faster in its view than they would if the ground were flat, giving the helicopter a false sense of its motion. “The onboard navigation has no way of explaining it, except for thinking maybe I’m turning or spinning a bit,” Balaram says. The helicopter ends up veering to the side.</p>



<p>The team has come up with some work-arounds, such as choosing large enough landing zones that a precision landing isn’t necessary and slowing down when flying over rough terrain.</p>



<h4>Coping with seasons</h4>



<p>The air on Mars is <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/perseverance-mars-weather-dust-storms">notoriously thin</a> (<em>SN: 7/14/20</em>). But since mid-September, the atmosphere in Jezero crater has been getting even thinner. As that part of Mars shifts from spring to summer, the air density has gone from about 1.5 percent of Earth’s at sea level, to about 1 percent.</p>



<p>That doesn’t sound like a big difference, but it’s enough that Ingenuity has had to spin its rotor blades faster to stay aloft. In October, the helicopter increased its rotor speed to 2,700 revolutions per minute, compared with a previous maximum of 2,537 rpm.</p>

<p>At that faster spin speed, the helicopter can fly for only 130 seconds at a time instead of the 170 seconds it managed before, without running the risk of the motors overheating.</p>



<p>That would be fine if the helicopter was just going to hang around the rover in one area, Tzanetos says. But the Mars duo’s next task is a race to the long-dry river delta at the mouth of Jezero crater. The Perseverance team hopes to cover hundreds of meters each Martian day. The farthest Ingenuity has covered in a day is 625 meters, and that was with the lower spin speed.</p>



<p>“It’ll be challenging to keep up,” Tzanetos says.</p>



<p>There’s no technical reason why Ingenuity can’t make it, though, Balaram says. “It’s certainly possible that one day it just won’t wake up. Or a landing will be a failure and we’ll never hear from it again because it tipped over,” he admits. “Those are rolls of the dice, there’s nothing inevitable about those. Barring that, it should keep working for many months.”</p>



<h4>Inspiring future fliers</h4>



<p>Meanwhile, engineers are already dreaming of the next Martian aircraft.</p>



<p>“Ingenuity is very exciting, we’re breaking a lot of ground,” Tzanetos says. “The whole point of it is to be that foundation. The important thing is what comes next.”</p>



<p>Current blueprints include a scaled-up version of Ingenuity that could carry more equipment and work alone or with a rover, and a large hexacopter, with six rotors arranged around a central ring. A craft like that could cover more ground more quickly than a rover, traveling distances that could take Perseverance multiple years in just a few months.</p>



<p>A <a href="https://baas.aas.org/pub/2021n4i361/release/1">white paper</a> submitted to the 2023–2032 planetary science and astrobiology decadal survey — a once-a-decade review of the fields’ goals and priorities — suggests several possible missions for a Mars Science Helicopter. In one, the craft could take samples of clay minerals at a site like Mawrth Vallis, a channel thought to be carved by a long-ago flood.</p>

<p>Mawrth was a finalist for the last two Mars rover landing sites and is a contender for the European Space Agency’s Rosalind Franklin rover, set to launch in 2022. Clays can preserve organic material on Earth, so a mission to Mawrth could search for signs of life.</p>



<p>A helicopter could also explore craters with water ice deposits with slopes too steep for rover wheels. And by taking measurements at several different altitudes, the helicopter could help figure out how the <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/mars-water-molecules-upper-atmosphere-chemical-reactions">atmosphere exchanges gases with the ground</a>, which could help solve the mystery of when and how Mars lost its liquid water (<em>SN: 11/12/20</em>). Or a helicopter could map the magnetic field of large swaths of the Martian surface, revealing when and how the <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/what-nasa-insight-lander-learned-about-mars-magnetism-quakes">Red Planet lost its molten core </a>(<em>SN: 2/24/20</em>).</p>



<p>And whenever astronauts get around to visiting Mars, “it might be useful to have fleets of drones zipping around the skies, carrying loads or scouting ahead,” Tzanetos says. “That’s the exciting future I’m looking forward to.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/ct-scan-50-years-anniversary-first-image-medicine-physics">For 50 years, CT scans have saved lives, revealed beauty and more</a></h4>

              
                <p>One grainy, gray-scale image of a brain changed science and medicine forever.</p>



<p>Half a century ago, the first CT image of a patient lifted the veil of invisibility that cloaks the interior of the human body, providing scientists a window on our innards unlike any before. </p>



<p>Today, doctors in the United States alone order more than 80 million scans per year. X-ray computed tomography, or CT, is frequently the quickest way of getting a handle on what’s causing a mysterious woe. CT scans can ferret out heart disease, tumors, blood clots, fractures, internal bleeding and more. The technique can give surgeons a heads-up about what they will encounter inside a patient, and guide treatment for cancer and other diseases.</p>



<p>“It answers so many questions quickly. That’s why it’s used,” says medical physicist Cynthia McCollough of the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minn.</p>





<p>A CT scan involves thousands of X-ray measurements taken from multiple angles. Here’s how it works: A source of X-rays rotates around the body, sending a beam of radiation through bone, blood and tissue, while rotating detectors measure the beam that makes it through.</p>



<p>Different materials in the body absorb X-rays differently. The calcium in bone vigorously sops up X-rays, for example, while soft tissues absorb less. So when the data collected by the detectors are stitched together by a computer, it can form a cross-sectional view of what’s inside based on where X-rays are absorbed more or less. Moving the table holding the patient so that the X-ray beam and detectors slide along the body enables 3-D reconstructions of organs and other parts.</p>





<p>Over the years, scientists have continually improved the technology, making it faster and higher resolution, and cutting the amount of radiation that patients receive. These improved CT scans have painted ever more detailed landscapes of the human body. It’s hard not to marvel at the beauty of the inner world that the scans bring to the surface.</p>



<p>Here’s a look back at some of the major advances in CT scans over the last 50 years.</p>



<h4>The CT scan is born</h4>



<p>In 1971, radiologist James Ambrose at Atkinson Morley Hospital in London performed the first CT scan of a patient in collaboration with engineer Godfrey Hounsfield, the technology’s inventor. Hounsfield worked for the British electronics company EMI, best known for its role as the record company for the Beatles.</p>

<p>The scan, an image just 80 pixels across and 80 pixels wide, didn’t provide a lot of detail. But it showcased the technology’s potential, revealing a tumor in a woman’s brain. A surgeon who later operated on the tumor is said to have marveled that “it looks exactly like the picture.”</p>



<p>Previously, if doctors wanted to look for a brain tumor, they injected air into the spinal column. Then they rotated the patient to allow the air to bubble up into the area around the brain to increase the contrast in standard X-ray images. The procedure “hurt like heck,” McCollough says. “Patients routinely vomited; it was like torture.” With CT scanning, that agony soon became a thing of the past.</p>



<h4>Any way you slice it</h4>



<p>At first, CT scanners were designed to image only the brain. But researchers quickly adapted the technology to take cross-sectional images, or slices, at various points along the body. Then, in the early 1990s, scanners were created in which the X-ray source scanned in a continuous spiral around the body, instead of taking individual cross-sections. That advance allowed a whole organ, such as the lungs, to be imaged in one go.</p>

<p>But the image resolution along the length of the body was still low. CT scanners with multiple rows of X-ray detectors solved this problem by imaging several slices of the body at once along the spiral path.</p>



<p>CT scanner manufacturers kept pushing up the number of detectors, making scanners that could capture more slices at once. When detectors hit 64 slices in the early 2000s, McCollough says, “the real ‘Wow’ happened.” Scans could be fast, high resolution and cover a significant length of the body, all at once. Today, scanners are even more sophisticated, using up to 320 slices.</p>



<p>Finally, the fragile complexity hidden inside the human body — from the intricate webs of blood vessels to the gracefully branching air passages of the lungs to the delicate yet sturdy structure of bone — was there for all to see.</p>



<h4>Doubling up</h4>



<p>When McCollough’s father-in-law landed in the emergency room with a painful wrist, he languished for hours while doctors tried to figure out what was wrong. Eventually, McCollough remembers, she asked, “Can’t we send him over to CT?”</p>



<p>Thanks to a technique called dual-energy CT, doctors were able to pinpoint the problem. Dual-energy CT, introduced in 2006, uses two beams of X-rays at different energies, instead of just one beam. Taking images this way allows the scanners to work out exactly what materials are within. Different materials absorb X-rays in different amounts, but in order to zero in on a specific type of material, you want to know how that absorption changes as the X-rays’ energy changes.</p>



<p>For example, dual-energy CT can distinguish between different types of crystals that can form in the joints, causing arthritis. Urate crystals indicate gout, and crystals containing calcium point to pseudogout. For McCollough’s father-in-law, the scan quickly uncovered the cause of his pain: pseudogout. In this way, CT scans can reveal the human body at its most basic level, the materials that make it up.</p>

<h4>Count on it</h4>



<p>The X-ray detectors in CT scanners are the “secret sauce” of the technology, McCollough says, because the detectors are how the machines measure the X-rays in the first place. Most CT scanners measure that radiation indirectly, first converting the X-rays into visible light and then converting that light into an electric signal. A new era of CT technology is cutting out the middleman. In September, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration OK’d the first “<a href="https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/fda-clears-first-major-imaging-device-advancement-computed-tomography-nearly-decade">photon-counting</a>” CT scanner.</p>



<p>X-rays are a type of high-energy light, and like all light, they are made up of particles called photons. Photon-counting CT scanners measure individual X-ray photons. The technology also allows for crisper, more detailed images and provides a measure of the energies of the photons, which, like dual-energy CT, identifies different materials inside the body.</p>

<h4>Beyond the (human) body</h4>



<p>CT scans may have been invented for medicine, but that didn’t stop other researchers from recognizing the technology’s usefulness. Scientists in fields including archaeology, biology and physics have harnessed the technology to better understand everything from <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/microct-xray-ancient-animal-mummies">mummified remains</a> (<em>SN: 8/</em><em>20/20</em>) to how cracks form in concrete to the anatomy of animals such as the earless monitor lizard (<em>Lanthanotus borneensis</em>).</p>

<p>This image of <em>L. borneensis </em>comes from the Florida Museum of Natural History in Gainesville. Researchers there are making 20,000 CT datasets of preserved specimens that represent every vertebrate genus housed in U.S. natural history collections to reveal the animals’ internal anatomy. Anyone in the world <a href="https://www.floridamuseum.ufl.edu/science/overt/">will be able to access these scans</a> online.</p>



<h4>The next 50 years</h4>



<p>Despite all of these advances, some researchers caution that physicians’ <a href="https://acpinternist.org/archives/2011/02/CT.htm">love affair with CT has gone too far</a>, at least in the United States, where the scans are used more often than in many other countries. Unneeded CT scans can have drawbacks: They may uncover unrelated findings that look concerning but are probably benign, which could lead to expensive and anxiety-inducing additional testing. But foregoing CT scans can also have negative impacts, by slowing diagnoses for ailments that resolve best if treated quickly.</p>

<p>There’s no denying that, when warranted, CT scans are a crucial, lifesaving part of the medical toolkit. Recently, the scans have been in the spotlight for revealing <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coronavirus-covid-19-some-patients-may-suffer-lasting-lung-damage">damage done to the lungs by COVID-19</a> (<em>SN: 4/27/20</em>). The technology seems poised to remain a mainstay of medicine and science in future decades, continuing to scan its way into our hearts, lungs, brains and everywhere else.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/tropical-forest-recovery-ecosystem">Cleared tropical forests can regain ground surprisingly fast</a></h4>

              
                <p>Tropical forests are disappearing at an alarming clip across the globe. As lush land is cleared for agriculture, climate-warming carbon gets released and biodiversity declines.&nbsp;But when farmland is left alone, nature can make a surprisingly quick comeback.</p>



<p>After just 20 years, <a href="http://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.abh3629">forests can recover</a> by nearly 80 percent in certain key areas, including biodiversity and soil health, researchers report in the Dec. 10 <em>Science</em>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Keeping <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/planting-trees-protect-forests-climate-change">existing forests intact</a> is crucial for curbing climate change and stemming species loss (<em>SN: 7/13/21</em>), says ecologist Lourens Poorter of Wageningen University in the Netherlands. But this research shows “there&#8217;s tremendous [climate] mitigation potential” in letting forests regenerate.</p>



<p>Land cleared of tropical forests often is abandoned after a few years of low-intensity agricultural use, Poorter says, allowing nature to creep back in. To see how such areas recover, he and colleagues studied 77 sites across the Americas and West Africa that are regrowing forests that vary in age. Using 51 old-growth sites, those that show no signs of human use in at least 100 years, as a baseline, the researchers investigated 12 forest attributes related to soil health, ecosystem functioning, forest structure and plant biodiversity, analyzing how quickly those things recovered.</p>





<div class="wp-block-sciencenews-content-sidebar">
<h3>On the mend</h3>



<p>Tropical forests can re-establish themselves on abandoned agricultural lands faster than expected, recovering by nearly 80 percent on average in just 20 years, new research suggests. But different forest attributes, related to soil (red), diversity (orange) and structure (blue), recover at different rates. Soil carbon and nitrogen levels rapidly recovered, reaching levels close to those found in old-growth forests in about 20 years. Plant species richness, or the number of species, in regrowing forests takes longer to come close to old-growth levels — about 40 years — while species composition, or the relative abundances of those species, takes more than a century. Likewise, total aboveground biomass will take 120 years to approach old-growth levels, the scientists estimate. </p>

<p>Soil bounced back fastest, its carbon and nitrogen levels nearly reaching those of old-growth forests within a decade after abandonment. After 38 years, regrowing forests had nearly as many plant species on average as similar old-growth forests, though it will take 120 years for the relative abundances of the species to rebound to 90 percent of old-growth levels, the researchers estimate. Total aboveground biomass will also take 120 years to near untouched forest levels, the data suggest.</p>



<p>Overall, “recovery was way faster than we expected it to be,” Poorter says. Seeds and stumps that remained after clearing probably accelerated the process. Recovery time could be slower on land that has experienced more intense agricultural use, he says, but protecting regrowing forests can be a “cheap, natural solution,” to help address the climate and biodiversity crises.</p>

                <p><em>By</em>&nbsp;<a href="https://emmayoung.net/">Emma Young</a></p>



<p>It’s natural to start a new year with plans to make this one better than the last. But if you are thinking about how to boost your wellbeing, it’s worth knowing that some &#8220;good&#8221; ways of living have dark sides, too…</p>



<span id="more-44857"></span>



<p><strong>Happiness</strong></p>



<p>People who are happy — who enjoy &#8220;hedonistic wellbeing&#8221; — experience plenty of positive emotions and are generally pretty satisfied with life. If this sounds like something worth aiming for, then a word of caution: there’s plenty of evidence that striving to be happier can backfire. The authors of an <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/1745691611406927">influential review article</a> published in <em>Perspectives on Psychological Science</em> back in 2011 concluded that while some of the strategies recommended for boosting happiness — such as taking time in the day to reflect on what you are grateful for — are far from bad in themselves, if you <em>expect</em> that they will make you feel noticeably happier, but find that they don’t, you can be left worse off than when you started. <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.3758/s13423-018-1436-7">More recently</a>, Aekyoung Kim and Sam Maglio from Rutgers concluded that people who pursue happiness can end up feeling that the time in the day to do what’s needed to achieve this is vanishing — which makes them more unhappy.</p>



<p>Two of the <a href="http://sonjalyubomirsky.com/files/2012/09/Fritz-Lyubomirsky-in-press-1.pdf">lessons from research in this area</a>: don’t start out with high expectations of how much happier you might become, and don’t feel that you should be devoting a lot of time to becoming happier. You might also want to look beyond happiness…</p>



<p><strong>&#8220;Meaning&#8221;</strong></p>



<p>Happiness is one dimension of wellbeing. But there’s also &#8220;eudaimonia&#8221; — the feeling that your life has meaning, and that you are reaching your potential.</p>



<p>No end of studies have highlighted the importance of meaning. In 2019, for example, Andrew Steptoe and Daisy Fancourt at UCL <a href="https://www.pnas.org/content/116/4/1207">published a study</a> in <em>PNAS </em>finding that people who felt more strongly that the things they did in their life were worthwhile — in other words, that their lives had meaning — were better off in all kinds of ways: socially, physically and emotionally. However, a <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0191886917305044?casa_token=sMxTODbBLMYAAAAA:r6T4qjptPBJevsTlYWNoUr6KKBdjH-ifl77E43JNYXGEMeNY2764qX9wh5IztLsc_qcjh9YmPg">recent study</a> by David Lane and Eugene Mathes in <em>Personality and Individual Differences</em> revealed that there can be downsides to meaning, too. The team’s study of university students found that those who perceived education and relationships as being meaningful reported more positive emotion — but <em>also</em> a greater fear of failure. &#8220;These findings suggest that meaning in life may be associated with not only happiness, but also stress because of the worry over losing the meaningful experience,&#8221; the researchers write.</p>



<p>This doesn’t mean that you shouldn’t pursue meaningful experiences, of course. But it does suggest that it’s sensible to prepare for the possibility that doing so may cause you some anxiety, as well. Still, that might not be a bad thing…</p>



<p><strong>What is a good life, anyway?</strong></p>



<p>Research into what makes some people feel that theirs is a &#8220;good life&#8221; tends to focus on happiness and meaning. But last year, US-based psychologists Shigehiro Oshi and Erin Westgate argued that we’ve been <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2021/09/14/weve-neglected-the-role-of-psychological-richness-when-considering-what-makes-a-good-life-study-argues/">missing a crucial third dimension: &#8220;psychological richness&#8221;</a>. A psychologically rich life is characterised by plenty of interesting and perspective-changing experiences. These need not be uniformly positive experiences. At their worst, they may even be traumatic at the time. When the researchers asked participants from nine different countries which type of life they would go for if they could only choose one, most chose &#8220;happy&#8221;, and &#8220;meaningful&#8221; came second, but there was a &#8220;substantial minority&#8221; of participants — ranging from 7% in Singapore to 17% in Germany — who said they would opt for a psychologically rich life <em>above</em> a happy or a meaningful one. For this group, at least, this most defines a &#8220;good life&#8221; for them. And anyone wanting to pursue this type of life should be prepared for difficulties, as well as great times, along the way.</p>



<p><strong>Mental calm<br></strong>Maybe you’re starting to wonder whether it would be better to set aside the grand pursuit of a good life, and aim for something else instead. Like feeling calmer, perhaps?</p>



<p>Mindfulness is often promoted as a way to achieve this. Indeed, there are plenty of studies finding that mindfulness can help even with mental health problems. However, as we <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2015/06/12/the-psychology-of-mindfulness-digested/">first reported back in 2015</a>, and <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2019/03/19/episode-15-is-mindfulness-a-panacea-or-overhyped-and-potentially-problematic/">later explored in episode 15 of our PsychCrunch podcast in 2019</a>, there are also reasons to be cautious. Mindfulness is not risk-free. For example, it <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2017/05/17/mindfulness-training-does-not-foster-empathy-and-can-even-make-narcissists-worse/">doesn’t necessarily foster empathy and can even make narcissists worse</a>, and while there is some work finding that it can improve decision-making, say, there’s also research concluding that it <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2015/10/20/mindfulness-meditation-increases-peoples-susceptibility-to-false-memories/">increases people’s susceptibility to false memories</a>.</p>



<p>Perhaps it was inevitable that something once so incredibly popular should experience a backlash. But if you haven’t tried mindfulness training before and are considering it for 2022, it’s worth knowing about the potential downsides, too.</p>



<p><strong>If all fails…</strong></p>



<p>If you do set yourself some goals for 2022, and find that you don’t quite achieve your hoped-for levels of happiness, meaning, psychological richness, calmness — or even &#8220;just&#8221; eating more healthily and exercising more — there is a way to mitigate the anxiety that might result. Earlier this year, we looked at the latest research on <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2021/03/16/how-to-cope-with-failure-according-to-psychology/">how best to cope with failure</a>. The key recommendations included:</p>



<ol type="a"><li>Be kind to yourself&nbsp;</li><li>Resist socially prescribed perfectionism</li><li>Don’t worry too much if you were over-confident — and wrong</li><li>Try not to take evidence of failure too personally</li></ol>



<p>In fact, if you are looking for some evidence-based ways of going about boosting your wellbeing in 2022, maybe <em>this</em> is the place to start. Because all of us, at some point, set ourselves goals that we don’t quite meet. One option is to stop setting goals. Another is to learn how to cope when not all work out — so you can reap the benefits of those that do.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/wildfire-smoke-toxic-ozone-urban-air-pollution-cities">Wildfire smoke may ramp up toxic ozone production in cities</a></h4>

              
                <p>Wildfire smoke and urban air pollution bring out the worst in each other.</p>



<p>As wildfires rage, they transform their burned fuel into a complex chemical cocktail of smoke. Many of these airborne compounds, including ozone, cause air quality to plummet as wind carries the smoldering haze over cities. But exactly how — and to what extent — wildfire emissions contribute to ozone levels downwind of the fires has been a matter of debate for years, says Joel Thornton, an atmospheric scientist at the University of Washington in Seattle.</p>



<p>A new study has now revealed the elusive chemistry behind ozone production in wildfire plumes. The findings suggest that mixing wildfire smoke with nitrogen oxides — toxic gases found in car exhaust — could <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.abl3648">pump up ozone levels in urban areas</a>, researchers report December 8 in <em>Science Advances</em>.</p>



<p>Atmospheric ozone is a major component of smog that <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/covid19-coronavirus-pandemic-air-pollution-ozone-shutdown">can trigger respiratory problems</a> in humans and wildlife (<em>SN: 1/4/21</em>). Many ingredients for making ozone — such as volatile organic compounds and nitrogen oxides — can be found in wildfire smoke, says Lu Xu, an atmospheric chemist currently at the National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration Chemical Sciences Laboratory in Boulder, Colo. But a list of ingredients isn’t enough to replicate a wildfire’s ozone recipe. So Xu and colleagues took to the sky to observe the chemistry in action.</p>





<p>Through a joint project with NASA and NOAA, the researchers worked with the Fire Influence on Regional to Global Environments and Air Quality flight campaign to transform a jetliner into a flying laboratory. In July and August 2019, the flight team collected air samples from smoldering landscapes across the western United States. As the plane passed headlong through the plumes, instruments onboard recorded the kinds and amounts of each molecule detected in the haze. By weaving in and out of the smoke as it drifted downwind from the flames, the team also analyzed how the plume’s chemical composition changed over time.</p>



<p>Using these measurements along with the wind patterns and fuel from each wildfire sampled, the researchers created a straightforward equation to calculate ozone production from wildfire emissions. “We took a complex question and gave it a simple answer,” says Xu, who did the work while at Caltech.</p>



<p>As expected, the researchers found that wildfire emissions contain a dizzying array of organic compounds and nitrogen oxide species among other molecules that contribute to ozone formation. Yet their analysis showed that the concentration of nitrogen oxides decreases in the hours after the plume is swept downwind. Without this key ingredient, ozone production slows substantially. &nbsp;</p>



<p>Air pollution from cities and other urban areas is chock full of noxious gases. So when wildfire smoke wafts over cityscapes, a boost of nitrous oxides could jump-start ozone production again, Xu says.</p>



<p>In a typical fire season, mixes like these could increase ozone levels by as much as 3 parts per billion in the western United States, the researchers estimate. This concentration is far below the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s <a href="https://www.epa.gov/sites/default/files/2016-04/documents/20151001healthfs.pdf">health safety standard</a> of 70 parts per billion, but the incremental increase could still pose a health risk to people who are regularly exposed to smoke, Xu says.</p>



<p>With climate change increasing the frequency and intensity of wildfires, this new ozone production mechanism has <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/wildfire-smoke-health-risks-air-quality-pollution">important implications</a> for urban air quality, says Qi Zhang, an atmospheric chemist at the University of California, Davis who was not involved in the study (<em>SN: 9/18/20</em>). She says the work provides an “important missing link” between wildfire emissions and ozone chemistry.</p>



<p>The findings may also pose a challenge for environmental policy makers, says Thornton, who was not involved in the research. Though state and local authorities set strict regulations to limit atmospheric ozone, wildfire smoke may undermine those strategies, he says. This could make it more difficult for cities, especially in the western United States, to meet EPA ozone standards despite air quality regulations.</p>

<p>Malaria is still a public health issue in the Brazilian Amazon and its transmission occurs in deforestation frontiers, the human-nature interface. Deforestation is the result of impoverished locals who undertake slash-and-burn activities on their own lands as a way of living. Clearings in patches of tropical rain forests create conditions for the larval habitats of the dominant malaria vector (<em>Anopheles darlingi</em>). When the anopheline larvae emerge into flying adults, adult females fly on seeking human hosts in the nearby houses. When these anopheline females bite a person carrying malaria parasites, they get infected and send propagating malaria parasites to the whole community.</p>

<p>Undertaking mosquito collections is an enormous task in the Amazonian settings. Every field plan must be reassessed as conditions turn out to change quickly during the days of field collection. Numerous methods for catching mosquitoes are used. One of them is the barrier screen (above) on which anophelines land and can be captured by us using small electric-powered aspirators. Field collections may last all night long (12 hours), which means everyone in the team has to stay awake during the night and sleep during the day.</p>
<p>Back in the lab with samples of anophelines, specimens are identified at the level of species and then tested for the presence of malaria parasites. Each malaria microcosm site has its landscape analyzed by remote sensing and satellite imagery from the initiation of colonization in the 1970s until now.</p>
<p>Altogether, 80 malaria microcosm sites all over the Amazon region were studied during our research project and the results have been <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-021-85890-3">published in <em>Scientific Reports</em></a>.</p>
<p>The main results obtained were: (A) malaria risk is greater when accumulated deforestation reaches 50%, (B) two temporal malaria peaks occur: one at 10 years and a second at 35 years after settlement initiation.</p>

<p>Our results ultimately show that the loss of forest cover supports the transmission of human malarial parasites over time in the Amazon. These results can be translated to policies aimed at public health intervention designs for enhanced health of locals and in favor of conservation of tropical rain forests and education of locals for keeping the forest up, complying directly with <strong>SDG3 – Good health and well-being</strong> and <strong>SDG15 – Life on land</strong>. Translational science in our field of research depends heavily on policies that are implemented by the government. With the proof of concept and scientific evidence that could be obtained from this research project, it is more likely that these policies can come to life and help in sustaining <strong>good health and well-being</strong> and <strong>life on land</strong>.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/vulture-bees-gut-bacteria-eat-rotting-flesh-sick">Gut bacteria let vulture bees eat rotting flesh without getting sick</a></h4>

              
                <p>Mention foraging bees and most people will picture insects flitting from flower to flower in search of nectar. But in the jungles of Central and South America, “vulture bees” have developed a taste for decaying flesh.</p>



<p>They are “the weirdos of the bee world,” says insect biologist Jessica Maccaro of the University of California, Riverside. Most bees are vegetarian.</p>



<p>Scientists have puzzled over why the stingless buzzers <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/flesh-eaters-bees-strip-carrion-also-take-wasp-young">seem to prefer rotting carcasses</a> to nectar (<em>SN: 2/11/04</em>). Now, Maccaro and colleagues think they have cracked the riddle by looking into the bees’ guts.</p>



<p>Vulture bees (<em>Trigona</em> spp.)<em> </em>have a lot more <a href="https://journals.asm.org/doi/10.1128/mBio.02317-21">acid-producing gut bacteria</a> than their vegetarian counterparts do, Maccaro and colleagues report November 23 in <em>mBio</em>. And those bacteria are the same types that protect carrion feeders such as vultures and hyenas from getting sick on rotting meat.</p>





<p>To probe the bees’ insides, Maccaro’s colleagues trekked into a Costa Rican jungle. Since vulture bees feed on almost any dead animal, including lizards and snakes, the researchers cut up store-bought chicken and suspended the raw flesh from tree branches. To deter ants, the team smeared petroleum jelly on the string that the meat dangled from.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“The funny thing is we’re all vegetarians,” says entomologist Quinn McFrederick, also of UC Riverside. “It was kind of gross for us to cut up the chicken.” That gross factor quickly intensified in the warm, humid jungle: The meat rotted, turning slimy and stinky.</p>



<p>Bees took the bait within a day. As the scavengers stopped by to dine, the researchers trapped about 30 bees. The team also captured another 30 or so of two other types of local bees — one that feeds on only flowers and one type that dines on both flowers and rotting meat. All bees were stored in alcohol-filled vials to preserve the insects’ DNA for analysis, as well as the DNA of any gut microbes.</p>



<p>Strictly meat-eating bees had between 30 percent and 35 percent more acid-producing gut bacteria than strictly vegetarian bees and the ones that sometimes eat meat, the team found. Some types of these microbes showed up only in the solely carnivorous bees.</p>



<p>Similar acid-producing bacteria in the guts of vultures and hyenas keep toxin-producing microbes in rotting meat from making the animals sick. The microbes probably do the same for the meat-eating bees, the team says.</p>



<p>The health benefit extends beyond individual bees, says David Roubik, an evolutionary ecologist at the Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute in Balboa, Panama, who was not involved in the work. Vulture bees regurgitate some of the meat they consume, storing it in their nests where it serves as food for young bees. Some of the acid-loving gut bacteria end up in this food reserve, Roubik says. “Otherwise, destructive bacteria would ruin the food and release enough toxins to kill the colony.”</p>



<p>In the end, Maccaro says, it’s hard to know which evolved first — the gut bacteria or the bees’ ability to eat meat. But the bees probably first turned to meat because there was so much competition for nectar for food, she suspects.</p>

                <p>This week on Journal Club session Harpreet Singh has planned an introductory presentation on the research developments in Natural Language processing NLP.
The main neural architecture he will discuss is the Transformers network, introduced in the paper &quot;Attention Is All You Need&quot;, which forms the backbone of many states of the art NLP models.</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>The dominant sequence transduction models are based on complex
recurrent or convolutional neural networks that include an encoder and
a decoder. The best performing models also connect the encoder and
decoder through an attention mechanism. We propose a new simple
network architecture, the Transformer, based solely on attention
mechanisms, dispensing with recurrence and convolutions entirely.
Experiments on two machine translation tasks show these models to be
superior in quality while being more parallelizable and requiring
significantly less time to train. Our model achieves 28.4 BLEU on the
WMT 2014 Englishto-German translation task, improving over the
existing best results, including ensembles, by over 2 BLEU. On the WMT
2014 English-to-French translation task, our model establishes a new
single-model state-of-the-art BLEU score of 41.8 after training for
3.5 days on eight GPUs, a small fraction of the training costs of the
best models from the literature. We show that the Transformer
generalizes well to other tasks by applying it successfully to English
constituency parsing both with large and limited training data.</p>

                <p><em>By</em> <a href="https://emmayoung.net/">Emma Young</a></p>



<p>Why do people share fake news? All kinds of studies have looked into <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2019/12/12/the-more-we-see-fake-news-the-more-likely-we-are-to-share-it/">what encourages it</a>, and which <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2020/07/20/people-who-crave-structure-are-more-likely-to-declare-that-errors-in-media-reports-are-fake-news/">personal attributes</a> play a role. As the authors of a <a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2021-96824-001">new paper </a>in the <em>Journal of Experimental Psychology: General</em> point out, multiple studies have found that political conservatives are relatively more likely to disseminate false news than those on the political left. However, their new work finds that this is an over-simplification — that the link is “largely driven” by conservatives who<em> are also low in conscientiousness</em>. This is an important finding for a few reasons. On the upside, it’s a far less politically polarising message. On the downside, this group does not seem to be receptive to the main identified way of stopping fake news from spreading.</p>



<span id="more-44808"></span>



<p>Asher Lawson and Hemant Kakkar at Duke University ran eight online studies on a total of 4,642 US-based participants. In the first, the participants were given 12 reputable and 12 fake news COVID-19 stories from websites. Participants who identified as conservative were, as expected, more likely to say that they would share fake stories. However, further analysis revealed that this was true for conservatives who were low in conscientiousness, but not for those who were high in conscientiousness (highly conscientious people are those who are more diligent and better at controlling impulses). A second study found the same pattern of results for political stories unrelated to Covid-19.</p>



<p>Earlier research has found that giving guidance on the likely veracity of a news article helps to stop the spread of fake news. Indeed, this has been highlighted as a potentially important way to counter its spread. So, would adding fact-checker tags, indicating that the content had been verified or was disputed, reduce the sharing of fake news by low conscientious conservatives? A third study found that it did not. The low conscientious conservatives were more likely to share fake news that aligned with, and so furthered, their own interests. It didn’t seem to matter whether they believed it to be true or not.</p>



<p>This conclusion was supported by the results of an even stronger intervention. When participants in a fresh study indicated they would share a fake news story, they were given an explicit warning that the content was probably false, and asked if they would still like to share. While conservatives were overall less likely than liberals to change their mind, this was especially true for low conscientiousness conservatives.</p>



<p>Based on the results of earlier work, the pair wondered whether this group might have a stronger &#8220;need for chaos&#8221; — a greater desire for anarchy — and that this might drive the effect. They ran yet further studies to investigate, and concluded that this does indeed seem to be the case. Other personality traits, level of trust in the mainstream media, attitudes towards Covid-19, age, gender and time spent on social media were all taken into account in their analyses.</p>



<p>Overall, when it came to the spreading of fake news, “disparities in sharing behaviour were nearly exclusively driven by low conscientiousness respondents”, with an “indiscriminate desire for chaos”, the pair writes. “To curtail the spread of misinformation, policymakers should focus on low conscientious conservatives.”</p>



<p>As low conscientious conservatives don’t seem to care whether a story that aligns with their beliefs and interests is true or not, it could be that interventions will need to target conscientiousness itself, rather than simply explaining that a story is fake, the pair writes. <em>How</em> to go about that is another matter entirely. But given the disastrous effects of the spreading of fake news on everything from public health to voter decisions, it’s surely vital that efforts are made to find out.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/quantum-physics-spin-liquid-atom">Physicists have coaxed ultracold atoms into an elusive form of quantum matter</a></h4>

              
                <p>An elusive form of matter called a quantum spin liquid isn’t a liquid, and it doesn’t spin — but it sure is quantum.</p>



<p>Predicted nearly 50 years ago, quantum spin liquids have long evaded definitive detection in the laboratory. But now, <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.abi8794">a lattice of ultracold atoms held in place with lasers</a> has shown hallmarks of the long-sought form of matter, researchers report in the Dec. 3 <em>Science.</em></p>



<p>Quantum entanglement goes into overdrive in the newly fashioned material. Even atoms on opposite sides of the lattice share entanglement, or quantum links, meaning that the properties of distant atoms are correlated with one another. “It’s very, very entangled,” says physicist Giulia Semeghini of Harvard University, a coauthor of the new study. “If you pick any two points of your system, they are connected to each other through this huge entanglement.” This strong, long-range entanglement could prove useful for building quantum computers, the researchers say.</p>



<p>The new material matches predictions for a quantum spin liquid, although its makeup strays a bit from conventional expectations. While the traditional idea of a quantum spin liquid relies on the quantum property of spin, which gives atoms magnetic fields, the new material is based on different atomic quirks.</p>





<p>A standard quantum spin liquid should arise among atoms whose spins are in conflict. Spin causes atoms to act as tiny magnets. Normally, at low temperatures, those atoms would align their magnetic poles in a regular pattern. For example, if one atom points up, its neighbors point down. But if atoms are arranged in a triangle, for example, each atom has two neighbors that themselves point in opposite directions. That arrangement leaves the third one with nowhere to turn — it can’t oppose both of its neighbors at once.</p>



<p>So atoms in quantum spin liquids <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/physics-quantum-spin-ice-fine-structure-constant">refuse to choose</a> (<em>SN: 9/21/21</em>). Instead, the atoms wind up in a superposition, a quantum combination of spin up and down, and each atom’s state is linked with those of its compatriots. The atoms are constantly fluctuating and never settle down into an orderly arrangement of spins, similarly to how atoms in a normal liquid are scattered about rather than arranged in a regularly repeating pattern, hence the name.</p>



<p>Conclusive evidence of quantum spin liquids has been hard to come by in solid materials. In the new study, the researchers took a different tack: They created an artificial material composed of 219 trapped rubidium atoms cooled to a temperature of around 10 microkelvins (about –273.15° Celsius). The array of atoms, known as a programmable quantum simulator, allows scientists to fine-tune how atoms interact to investigate exotic forms of quantum matter.</p>



<p>In the new experiment, rather than the atoms’ spins being in opposition, a different property created disagreement. The researchers used lasers to put the atoms into <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/bacteria-sized-molecules-created-lab">Rydberg states</a>, meaning one of an atom’s electrons is bumped to a very high energy level (<em>SN: 8/29/16</em>). If one atom is in a Rydberg state, its neighbors prefer not to be. That setup begets a Rydberg-or-not discord, analogous to the spin-up and -down battle in a traditional quantum spin liquid.</p>



<p>The scientists confirmed the quantum spin liquid effect by studying the properties of atoms that fell along loops traced through the material. According to quantum math, those atoms should have exhibited certain properties unique to quantum spin liquids. The results matched expectations for a quantum spin liquid and revealed that long-range entanglement was present.</p>



<p>Notably, the material’s entanglement is topological. That means it is described by a branch of mathematics called topology, in which an object is <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/nobel-awarded-using-math-shapes-explain-exotic-matter">defined by certain geometrical properties</a>, for example, its number of holes (<em>SN: 10/4/16</em>). Topology can protect information from being destroyed: A bagel that falls off the counter will still have exactly one hole, for example. This information-preserving feature could be a boon to quantum computers, which must grapple with <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/quantum-computers-hype-supremacy-error-correction-problems">fragile, easily destroyed</a> quantum information that makes calculations subject to mistakes (<em>SN: 6/22/20</em>).</p>



<p>Whether the material truly qualifies as a quantum spin liquid, despite not being based on spin, depends on your choice of language, says theoretical physicist Christopher Laumann of Boston University, who was not involved with the study. Some physicists use the term “spin” to describe other systems with two possible options, because it has the same mathematics as atomic spins that can point either up or down. “Words have meaning, until they don’t,” he quips. It all depends how you spin them.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/cancer-biology-studies-research-replication-reproducibility">A massive 8-year effort finds that much cancer research can’t be replicated</a></h4>

              
                <p>After eight years, a project that tried to reproduce the results of key cancer biology studies has finally concluded. And its findings suggest that like research in the social sciences, cancer research has a replication problem.</p>



<p>Researchers with the <a href="https://www.cos.io/rpcb">Reproducibility Project: Cancer Biology</a> aimed to replicate 193 experiments from 53 top cancer papers published from 2010 to 2012. But only a quarter of those experiments <a href="https://doi.org/10.7554/eLife.67995">were able to be reproduced</a>, the team reports in two papers published December 7 in <em>eLife</em>.</p>



<p>The researchers couldn’t complete the majority of experiments because the team couldn’t gather <a href="https://doi.org/10.7554/eLife.67995">enough information from the original papers</a> or their authors about methods used, or obtain the necessary materials needed to attempt replication.</p>



<p>What’s more, of the 50 experiments from 23 papers that were reproduced, effect sizes were, on average, 85 percent lower than those reported in the original experiments. Effect sizes indicate how big the effect found in a study is. For example, two studies might find that a certain chemical kills cancer cells, but the chemical kills 30 percent of cells in one experiment and 80 percent of cells in a different experiment. The first experiment has less than half the effect size seen in the second one.&nbsp;</p>





<p>The team also measured if a replication was successful using five criteria. Four focused on effect sizes, and the fifth looked at whether both the original and replicated experiments had similarly positive or negative results, and if both sets of results were statistically significant. The researchers were able to apply those criteria to 112 tested effects from the experiments they could reproduce. Ultimately, just 46 percent, or 51, met more criteria than they failed, the researchers report.</p>



<p>“The report tells us a lot about the culture and realities of the way cancer biology works, and it&#8217;s not a flattering picture at all,” says Jonathan Kimmelman, a bioethicist at McGill University in Montreal. He coauthored a <a href="https://doi.org/10.7554/eLife.67527">commentary</a> on the project exploring the ethical aspects of the findings.</p>



<p>It’s worrisome if experiments that cannot be reproduced are used to launch clinical trials or drug development efforts, Kimmelman says. If it turns out that the science on which a drug is based is not reliable, “it means that patients are needlessly exposed to drugs that are unsafe and that really don&#8217;t even have a shot at making an impact on cancer,” he says.</p>



<p>At the same time, Kimmelman cautions against overinterpreting the findings as suggesting that the current cancer research system is broken. “We actually don&#8217;t know how well the system is working,” he says. One of the many questions left unresolved by the project is what an appropriate rate of replication is in cancer research, since replicating all studies perfectly isn’t possible. “That&#8217;s a moral question,” he says. “That&#8217;s a policy question. That&#8217;s not really a scientific question.”</p>



<p>The overarching lessons of the project suggest that substantial inefficiency in preclinical research may be hampering the drug development pipeline later on, says Tim Errington, who led the project. He is the director of research at the Center for Open Science in Charlottesville, Va., which cosponsored the research.</p>



<p>As many as <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nbt.2786">19 out of 20 cancer drugs that enter clinical trials</a> never receive approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. Sometimes that’s because the drugs lack commercial potential, but more often it is because they do not show the level of safety and effectiveness needed for licensure.</p>

<p>Much of that failure is expected. “We&#8217;re humans trying to understand complex disease, we&#8217;re never going to get it right,” Errington says. But given the cancer reproducibility project’s findings, perhaps “we should have known that we were failing earlier, or maybe we don&#8217;t understand actually what&#8217;s causing [an] exciting finding,” he says.</p>



<p>Still, it’s not that failure to replicate means that a study was wrong or that replicating it means that the findings are correct, says Shirley Wang, an epidemiologist at Brigham and Women’s Hospital in Boston and Harvard Medical School. “It just means that you&#8217;re able to reproduce,” she says, a point that the reproducibility project also stresses.</p>



<p>Scientists still have to evaluate whether a study’s methods are unbiased and rigorous, says Wang, who was not involved in the project but reviewed its findings. And if the results of original experiments and their replications do differ, it’s a learning opportunity to find out why and the implications, she adds.</p>



<p>Errington and his colleagues have reported on <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/cancer-studies-get-mixed-grades-redo-tests">subsets of the cancer reproducibility project’s findings before</a>, but this is the first time that the effort’s entire analysis has been released (<em>SN: 1/18/17</em>).</p>



<p>During the project, the researchers faced a number of obstacles, particularly that none of the original experiments included enough details in their published studies about methods to attempt reproduction. So the reproducibility researchers contacted the studies’ authors for additional information.</p>



<p>While about a quarter of the authors were helpful, another third did not reply to requests for more information or were not otherwise helpful, the project found. For example, one of the experiments that the group was unable to replicate required the use of a mouse model specifically bred for the original experiment. Errington says that the scientists who conducted that work refused to share some of these mice with the reproducibility project, and without those rodents, replication was impossible.</p>

<p>Some researchers were outright hostile to the idea that independent scientists wanted to attempt to replicate their work, Errington says. That attitude is a product of a research culture that values innovation over replication, and that prizes the academic publish-or-perish system over cooperation and data sharing, says Brian Nosek, executive director at the <a href="https://www.cos.io/">Center for Open Science</a> and a coauthor on both studies.</p>



<p>Some scientists may feel threatened by replication because it is uncommon. “If replication is normal and routine, people wouldn’t see it as a threat,” Nosek says. But replication may also feel intimidating because scientists’ livelihoods and even identities are often so deeply rooted in their findings, he says. “Publication is the currency of advancement, a key reward that turns into chances for funding, chances for a job and chances for keeping that job,” Nosek says. “Replication doesn’t fit neatly into that rewards system.”</p>



<p>Even authors who wanted to help couldn’t always share their data for various reasons, including lost hard drives or intellectual property restrictions or data that only former graduate students had.</p>



<p>Calls from some experts about science’s “<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/533452a">reproducibility crisis</a>” have been growing for years, perhaps most notably <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/blog/science-the-public/replication-crisis-psychology-science-studies-statistics">in psychology</a> <em>(SN: 8/27/18</em>)<em>.</em> Then in 2011 and 2012, pharmaceutical companies <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nrd3439-c1">Bayer</a> and <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/483531a">Amgen</a> reported difficulties in replicating findings from preclinical biomedical research.</p>



<p>But not everyone agrees on solutions, including <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/redoing-scientific-research-best-way-find-truth">whether replication of key experiments is actually useful or possible</a>, or even what exactly is wrong with the way science is done or what needs to improve (<em>SN: 1/13/15</em>). &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>At least one clear, actionable conclusion emerged from the new findings, says Yvette Seger, director of science policy at the Federation of American Societies for Experimental Biology. That’s the need to provide scientists with as much opportunity as possible to explain exactly how they conducted their research.</p>



<p>“Scientists should aspire to include as much information about their experimental methods as possible to ensure understanding about results on the other side,” says Seger, who was not involved in the reproducibility project.</p>



<p>Ultimately, if science is to be a self-correcting discipline, there needs to be plenty of opportunities not only for making mistakes but also for discovering those mistakes, including by replicating experiments, the project’s researchers say.</p>



<p>“In general, the public understands science is hard, and I think the public also understands that science is going to make errors,” Nosek says. “The concern is and should be, is science efficient at catching its errors?” The cancer project’s findings don’t necessarily answer that question, but they do highlight the challenges of trying to find out.</p>

                <p><em>By </em><a href="http://emilyoliviareynolds.com/">Emily Reynolds</a></p>



<p>We often hear that we’re living in an age of polarisation and divisiveness, unable to transcend political boundaries to listen to those who we disagree with. But how do we feel about those people who share our views but who seek to understand opponents anyway?</p>



<p>This is the subject of a <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/09567976211011969#_i6">new study</a> in <em>Psychological Science</em>, authored by the University of British Columbia’s Gordon Heltzel and Kristin Laurin. They find that while we generally prefer those who seek alternative views, this falters when they appear to be susceptible to changing sides. </p>



<span id="more-44804"></span>



<p>In the first study, 233 participants read about four contentious topics — affirmative action, climate change, immigration and welfare — choosing which of two stances they agreed with more (e.g. “support tougher immigration policies” or “oppose tougher immigration policies”). They then read about two individuals, both of whom shared their beliefs about one of the issues. One of these individuals, however, sometimes watched news reports or read articles espousing alternative views, while the other did not. Participants then completed a &#8220;feeling thermometer&#8221;, indicating how they felt about the two individuals, as well as indicating their approval of them as a friend, teacher, and politician and selecting words to describe them.</p>



<p>Participants preferred the individual who sought alternative views, and this seemed to be because they felt they were more tolerant and rational. However, they also had greater concerns that this individual could adopt opposition views. This preference was also found in two follow-up studies with a similar procedure.</p>



<p>In the next study, participants again reported their views on four hot button topics and read about individuals who either sought or avoided alternative views. But this time, the participants also learned about the individual’s motivations: in one condition, participants read that the perspective-seeker had co-operative motives, trying to end conflict, while in another they read this individual had competitive motives, trying to advance their own cause through understanding counterarguments. Similarly, those who read about the perspective-avoider either learned that this individual wanted to stop fighting with people with opposing views (again, a co-operative motive), or that they did not want to betray their principles by speaking to the &#8220;enemy&#8221; (a competitive motive).</p>



<p>Participants again preferred those who sought different views to those who avoided different views. And while they liked both perspective-seekers similarly, they particularly <em>disliked</em> the “co-operative” individual who avoided seeking alternative views because of a dislike of conflict.</p>



<p>In a third study, participants indicated their stance on particular political issues before once again reading a vignette; this time, conditions were manipulated so some participants read about fully politically committed individuals while others read about those who were more on the fence. Unsurprisingly, participants preferred targets who were more committed to their own side, and again preferred those who sought rather than avoided different views — at least when they were committed, or partially committed, to their own side. However, when the individual was not committed to shared ideals, participants no longer preferred their seeking out different views, reflecting the concerns highlighted in the first study about potentially switching sides.</p>



<p>So, overall, when it comes to those who share our views, it seems there is a sweet spot. We prefer those who seek to understand and cooperate with opponents rather than avoid them, considering them tolerant and cooperative — but we also <em>dislike</em> them when they seem to validate opposing views and have the potential to change their minds, particularly when they appear less committed to shared political ideals.</p>



<p>This could be tricky ground to navigate for those hoping to hold onto friends with particularly strong ideological commitments. But if you run out of friends who share your beliefs, never fear — there’s always <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2020/08/11/people-prefer-strangers-who-share-their-political-views-to-friends-who-dont/">strangers</a>.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/feathers-light-color-migrating-birds-cool-long-flights">Light-colored feathers may help migrating birds stay cool on long flights</a></h4>

              
                <p>From teeny hummingbirds to giant whooping cranes, roughly half of the world’s more than 10,000 bird species migrate. Longer wings and beefed-up flying muscles often help these birds crisscross vast expanses of air. But a study of nearly all bird species suggests many migrators share another unexpected flight aid: lighter-colored feathers.</p>



<p>Being a tad more lightly colored than non-migrating birds <a href="https://www.cell.com/current-biology/fulltext/S0960-9822(21)01492-5?utm_source=EA">may help these long-distance fliers stay cool</a> as they work hard under the hot sun to fly, researchers report December 6 in <em>Current Biology</em>.</p>



<p>It’s known that color can help birds hide from predators by blending in, or attract mates by standing out. But color has subtler effects too, including regulating temperature by absorbing or reflecting light, says Kaspar Delhey, an ornithologist at the Max Planck Institute for Ornithology in Seewiesen, Germany. For example, bird eggs laid in colder climates <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/bird-eggs-laid-cold-climates-are-darker-may-keep-eggs-warm">tend to be darker</a>, which may help keep them warm (<em>SN: 10/28/19</em>).&nbsp;</p>



<p>Migrating birds push their bodies to the physiological limit, which creates excess heat. Some <a href="https://www.cell.com/current-biology/pdfExtended/S0960-9822(21)00745-4">species cope</a> by <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33958477/">ascending to cooler air</a> during daytime. “If overheating is a problem in migratory birds, another way of dealing with that would be to evolve lighter colors” that absorb less heat, Delhey says.</p>





<p>Delhey and his colleagues analyzed over <a href="https://birdsoftheworld.org/bow/home">20,000 illustrations</a> of 10,618 bird species, ranking plumage lightness for each species and comparing that with how far the birds fly. On average, lightness slightly increased with migratory distance, the team found. The longest-distance migrators were about 4 percent lighter than non-migrators, an effect that wasn’t explained by size, climate or habitat type for different species.</p>



<p>“It’s not a big difference,” Delhey says, noting that many migrators are darkly colored, perhaps for reasons unrelated to flight. But the trend was remarkably consistent.</p>



<p>“Very different groups with very different biologies show this pattern,” Delhey says. “That surprised us.”&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE</strong> (December 6, 2021)</p>



<p><strong>COVID-19 research freely accessible, but research data sharing and preprinting are low</strong></p>



<p>Levels of COVID-19 research data sharing have remained low during the pandemic, and preprinting of research on the virus has been lower than two initiatives tried to ensure it would be. This is according to a new <a href="https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.17125394.v1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">report </a>that examines the effectiveness of initiatives taken by players in the research ecosystem to promote sharing of COVID-19 research by stepping up open science approaches.</p>



<p>While the efforts of scientific publishers and the research community have speeded up publication times for COVID-19 research, and made much of it freely accessible, more effort is needed if society is to truly benefit from open science, the <em>Scholarly Communication in Times of Crisis: The response of the scholarly communication system to the COVID-19 pandemic </em>report says.</p>



<p>The sharing of the SARS-CoV-2 genome is seen as the poster child for open science, and the pandemic held up as a turning point for open science. Yet the report finds this has only partly been realised. It makes a series of key recommendations, three of which focus on opening up data, encouraging preprinting and strengthening collaboration across the scholarly communication ecosystem:</p>



<ul><li><strong>Only joint efforts will improve the availability and quality of research data sharing.</strong> Common data policy templates should be developed to require data sets and software to be posted to a trusted, FAIR-enabling repository, and to require formal citations to data sets and software.</li><li><strong>Mandating preprinting and rewarding researchers who use preprints </strong>could shift the needle.&nbsp; Publishers should include posting of preprints in their submission workflows and leaders should advocate for preprints.</li><li><strong>Publishers and other scholarly communication organisations</strong> should intensify their joint efforts to improve the availability and quality of data and metadata on scholarly publishing, allowing for robust evidence-informed approaches to innovation in scholarly communication.</li></ul>



<p>The report concludes that <strong>there is no magic bullet </strong>to improving scholarly communication. It is a joint responsibility that requires collaboration and coordinated action across stakeholders in the research system.</p>



<p>Early in 2020 a <a href="https://wellcome.org/press-release/sharing-research-data-and-findings-relevant-novel-coronavirus-ncov-outbreak" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Wellcome-coordinated COVID-19 statement</a>, signed by over 30 publishers, called for open or free access to all COVID-19 publications for the duration of the pandemic; for COVID-19 papers to be made available via preprint servers prior to journal publication; and data from COVID-19 research to be shared as early as possible.</p>



<p>A second initiative, launched by a group of publishers and related organisations, the <a href="https://oaspa.org/covid-19-publishers-open-letter-of-intent-rapid-review/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">COVID-19 Rapid Review Initiative</a>, worked on implementing the commitments made in the Wellcome-coordinated COVID-19 statement and aimed to accelerate peer review of COVID-19 papers.</p>



<p><em>Scholarly Communication in Times of Crisis: The response of the scholarly communication system to the COVID-19 pandemic</em> has been written by a team comprising researchers, publishers, and other scholarly communication experts, all associated with the COVID-19 Rapid Review Initiative. It presents the results of research undertaken by the team and reviews research conducted by others, with a view to identify opportunities for the scholarly communication stakeholders to effect change that will extend beyond the pandemic and have long-lasting benefits.</p>



<p>The authors also conclude that obtaining robust evidence on the response of the scholarly communication system to the COVID-19 pandemic is challenging. Relevant publishing data is often not available or is of limited quality. To enable robust evidence-informed approaches to innovation in scholarly communication, joint efforts to improve the availability and quality of this type of data are needed.</p>



<p>Ludo Waltman, Associate Director, Research on Research Institute (RoRI) and Professor of Quantitative Science Studies,&nbsp; Centre for Science and Technology Studies (CWTS) at Leiden University says: &ldquo;Development of innovative new forms of peer review, for instance by @PREreview_ and @mitpress @RapidReviewsC19, is extremely important and deserves further attention from all relevant actors in the system. I hope that the pandemic will be an impetus for more innovation in this area.&rdquo;</p>



<p>Stephen Pinfield, Associate Director, Research on Research Institute (RoRI) and Professor of Information Services Management, University of Sheffield says: &ldquo;Approaches adopted during the pandemic have powerfully illustrated the benefits of openness. It is important that we apply those lessons in future to improve the scholarly communication system for the benefit of the research community and society more generally.&rdquo;</p>

<p><strong>About COVID-19 Collaboration Group</strong></p>



<p>On 27 April 2020, a group of publishers and scholarly communications organisations announced a joint initiative to maximize the efficiency of peer review, ensuring that key work related to COVID-19 is reviewed and published as quickly and openly as possible, supported by Open Access Scholarly Publishers Association ( https://oaspa.org/covid-19-publishers-open-letter-of-intent-rapid-review/).</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/invasive-grasses-spread-wildfire-plants">Invasive grasses are taking over the American West’s sea of sagebrush</a></h4>

              
                <p>No one likes a cheater, especially one that prospers as easily as the grass <em>Bromus</em> <em>tectorum </em>does in the American West.<em> </em>This invasive species is called cheatgrass<em> </em>because it dries out earlier than native plants, shortchanging wildlife and livestock in search of nutritious food.</p>



<p>Unfortunately for those animals and the crowded-out native plants, cheatgrass and several other invasive annual grasses now dominate one-fifth of the Great Basin, a wide swath of land that includes portions of Oregon, Nevada, Idaho, Utah and California. In 2020, these invasive grasses covered <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/ddi.13440">more than 77,000 square kilometers of Great Basin ecosystems</a>, including higher elevation habitats that are now accessible to nonnative plants due to climate change, researchers report November 17 in <em>Diversity and Distributions</em>.</p>



<p>This invasion of exotic annual grasses is degrading one of North America’s most imperiled biomes: a vast sea of sagebrush shrubs, wildflowers and bunchgrasses where pronghorn and mule deer roam and where ranchers rely on healthy rangelands to raise cattle.</p>



<p>What’s more, these invasive grasses, which are highly flammable when dry, are also linked to more frequent and larger wildfires. In parts of Idaho’s Snake River Plain that are dominated by cheatgrass, for example, fires now occur <a href="https://www.fs.fed.us/rm/pubs_int/int_gtr276/int_gtr276_004_010.pdf">every three to five years</a> as opposed to the historical average of 60 to 110 years. From 2000 to 2009, <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/gcb.12046">39 out of 50 of the largest fires</a> in the Great Basin were associated with cheatgrass.</p>





<p>To add insult to injury, cheatgrass is more efficient at recolonizing burned areas after a fire than native plants, creating a vicious loop: More cheatgrass causes more fires, and more fires foster more of the weeds. This means that land managers are often behind the curve, trying to keep cheatgrass from spreading to prevent wildfires, while also attempting to restore native plant communities after fires so that the sagebrush ecosystems don’t transition into a monoculture of invasive grasses.</p>



<p>“We need to get strategic spatially to pinpoint where to protect intact native plant communities rather than constantly chasing the problem,” says Joseph Smith, a rangeland ecology researcher at the University of Montana in Missoula.</p>



<p>To do that, Smith and his colleagues quantified how much of the Great Basin has transitioned to invasive annual grasses over the last three decades. The researchers used the <a href="https://rangelands.app/rap/">Rangeland Analysis Platform</a>, or RAP, a remote sensing product powered by Google Earth Engine that estimates the type and percentage of vegetation at a baseball diamond–sized scale.</p>



<p>While the satellite imagery that RAP relies on can show where annual grasses turn brown in late spring in the West or where perennial plants stay green longer into the summer, the technology can’t delineate between native and nonnative plants. So researchers cross-checked RAP data with on-the-ground vegetation surveys collected through the U.S. Bureau of Land Management’s assessment, inventory and monitoring strategy.</p>



<p>Invasive annual grasses have increased eightfold in area in the Great Basin region since 1990, the team found. Smith and colleagues estimate that areas dominated by the grasses have grown more than 2,300 square kilometers annually, a rate of take-over proportionally greater than recent deforestation of the Amazon rainforest.</p>



<p>Perhaps most alarmingly, the team found that annual grasses, most of which are invasive, are steadily moving into higher elevations previously thought to be <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/climbing-high-save-threatened-west-coast-plant">at minimal risk of invasion</a> (<em>SN: 10/3/14</em>). Invasive annual grasses don’t tolerate cold, snowy winters as well as native perennial plants. But as a result of climate change, winters are trending more mild in the Great Basin and summers more arid. While perennial plants are struggling to survive the hot, dry months, invasive grass seeds simply lie dormant and wait for fall rains.</p>



<p>“In a lot of ways, invasive grasses just do an end run around perennials. They don’t have to deal with the harshest effects of climate change because of their different life cycle,” Smith explains.</p>



<p>Though the scale of the problem can seem overwhelming, free remote sensing technology like RAP may help land managers better target efforts to slow the spread of these invasive grasses and explore their connection to wildfires. Smith, for instance, is now researching how mapping annual grasses in the spring might help forecast summer wildfires.</p>



<p>“If we don’t know where the problem is, then we don’t know where to focus solutions,” says Bethany Bradley, an invasion ecologist and biogeographer at the University of Massachusetts Amherst who wasn’t involved in the research. “Mapping invasive grasses can certainly help people stop the grass-fire cycle by knowing where to treat them with herbicides.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/tangier-island-virginia-climate-change-uninhabitable">Climate change could make Virginia’s Tangier Island uninhabitable by 2051</a></h4>

              
                <p>Virginia’s Tangier Island is rapidly disappearing. Rising sea levels are exacerbating erosion and flooding, and could make the speck of land in the Chesapeake Bay uninhabitable within the next few decades. For years, island residents, policy makers and others have debated whether to attempt to save the island or relocate its small community elsewhere. But time to decide is running out, says David Schulte, a marine biologist with the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers.</p>



<p>Crucially, that choice will signal how other groups most at risk from climate change, “which are often Native American, minority or low-income such as the isolated fishing community of Tangier, will have their needs addressed — or ignored,” Schulte and his colleague Zehao Wu write in a new study.</p>



<p>The island’s sole town, Tangier, is located on three upland ridges that have largely been protected from coastal erosion. By analyzing aerial photographs of the area from 1967 to 2019, Schulte and Wu, a field researcher at Biogenic Solutions Consulting in Newport News, Va., found that nearly 62 percent of the ridges have been lost to sea level rise. What’s left <a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fclim.2021.779774/full">will convert completely to a wetland by 2051</a> — about a decade earlier than previously thought — the researchers report November 8 in <em>Frontiers in Climate</em>.</p>

Wu</span></figcaption></figure></div>



<p>Already, frequent flooding has turned the front yards of many Tangier homes into marshland, Schulte says. Empty parking lots and elevated homes, schools and sidewalks “are all signs of just how bad it is out there.”</p>



<p>Just 436 people lived on the island as of 2020, and that number could drop to zero by 2053, Schulte and Wu’s analysis of population trends suggests. Many factors, including fewer employment opportunities, play a role in the island’s population decline, the researchers say. The shrinking area of dry land has probably convinced people to leave as well.</p>





<p>Protecting and restoring Tangier Island might persuade some residents to stay, but it comes with a hefty price tag: between $250 million to $350 million, Schulte and Wu estimate. That money would fund a medley of interventions, including installing stone along the shoreline to fight erosion and raising the upland ridges by 3 meters using sand from the Chesapeake Bay. Moving a cubic meter of sand from the bottom of the bay to the island costs about $20. Considering the amount of sand needed to raise the ridges, “it gets very expensive really quick,” Schulte says.</p>





<p>Relocating Tangier residents is about $150 million cheaper, the researchers calculate. That estimate is based on others from the Corps and the U.S. Government Accountability Office to relocate U.S. coastal communities such as <a href="https://www.kqed.org/science/1977456/native-american-people-tell-stories-of-climate-loss-and-resilience">the towns of Shishmaref, Kivalina and Newtok</a> in Alaska, the <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2021-11-05/rising-pacific-drives-native-village-s-quest-for-higher-ground">Quinault Indian Nation village of Taholah</a> in Washington and <a href="https://www.nola.com/news/environment/article_b3ce8e12-0d0f-11ec-8b3e-efcab7617cd6.html">Isle de Jean Charles</a> in Louisiana.</p>



<p>But moving a town requires more than finding a place for residents to live, Schulte says. Infrastructure such as schools, medical facilities, grocery stores and restaurants need to be moved or rebuilt to provide the community with a similar lifestyle. For Tangier, the lack of land access to nearby towns adds to the cost of relocating, which must be done via boat, Schulte says.</p>

<p>As the planet warms and oceans swell, an increasing number of other coastal towns and cities in the United States and around the world will probably face a similar choice as Tangier. The cost to save or relocate each one would, of course, differ, Schulte says. Some communities may not be as expensive to move as offshore Tangier, he speculates, but would certainly be in the ballpark.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/climate-change-un-ipcc-report-humans">Sea level rise</a> has been driven, in part, by human activities in bigger cities (<em>SN: 8/9/21</em>). But it is shorelines, often inhabited by Native Americans, minority or low-income communities, that are the first to bear the brunt of this consequence of climate change, Wu notes. That makes it even more essential to draw attention to these overlooked communities, he says.</p>

                <p><em>By</em> <a href="https://emmayoung.net/">Emma Young</a></p>



<p>When we learn that something in our environment signals <em>Threat!,</em> we start to react to every encounter with the &#8220;fight or flight&#8221;, or &#8220;fear&#8221;, response. <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/2167702617743002">Recent work</a> has shown, though, that the presence of someone we’re close to — a friend or partner, say, — can reduce or even eliminate this response. Our brains seem to treat such people as a powerful &#8220;safety&#8221; signal.</p>



<p>This was thought to be a unique effect. But now a team led by Erica Hornstein at UCLA <a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/fulltext/2021-98211-001.pdf">has shown that physical warmth does the same thing</a>. The work, published in <em>Emotion</em>, was prompted by research finding that we <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2020/01/27/cold-days-can-make-us-long-for-social-contact-but-warming-up-our-bodies-eliminates-this-desire/">implicitly associate physical warmth with social support</a>. It has potential implications for treating anxiety disorders, especially for people who live alone — or who find it hard to unlearn links between certain stimuli and threat, as can happen with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).</p>



<span id="more-44799"></span>



<p>In the first of two studies, every time 31 participants were given a rubber ball, a soft fuzzy ball or a heated pack to hold, they were then given an electric shock. The shock was at a level that the researchers had previously established would be extremely uncomfortable, but not painful. One stimulus — a wooden block — was never paired with a shock.</p>



<p>The participants’ skin conductance (sweatiness) was monitored. This data showed that they quickly developed a fear response to the rubber ball and the fuzzy ball, but not the wooden block — <em>or</em> the warm pack. The warmth seemed to stop them from learning to associate the pack with a threat. When the team then gave the participants all the objects in turn, but without any shocks, the rubber ball and fuzzy ball still triggered a fear response (while the warm pack still did not).</p>



<p>A second study on 30 people supported and extended this finding. This time, the team paired pictures with electric shocks, so that participants developed a fear response to these pictures. They then showed participants the pictures again, while they held either a warm pack or a rubber ball. The warm pack, but not the ball, completely inhibited the fear response.</p>



<p>The team would love to see work exploring how, exactly, both supportive others and physical warmth interfere with the fear response. One possibility is that it’s to do with endogenous opioids — which have been found to be released both when we’re with a close other and by warmth, and which are known to affect fear learning.</p>



<p>It’s not yet known whether the warmth effect is innate, or reflects the learning in early life of an association between warmth and the presence and protection of a caregiver, which leads us to perceive warmth as a signal of safety. But however this effect works or emerges, the fact that it happens automatically is important.  Earlier work has certainly found that we can <em>learn</em> that certain stimuli signal &#8220;safety&#8221;. But, because this learning happens through classical conditioning, these &#8220;learned safety signals&#8221; really only work for the specific unpleasant event used in the training, the researchers point out. There’s also some evidence that they can even hinder fear reduction in the long term. But supportive others and physical warmth seem to have a more fundamental, blanket, ongoing effect.</p>



<p>For this reason, the researchers see potentially important implications for treating all kinds of anxiety disorders. Perhaps treatments that involve supportive others or — especially for people lacking in strong social bonds — physical warmth could be more effective than current methods for helping people with phobias or PTSD, for example. Clearly, there’s important work to be done. But I, for one, can’t wait to hear what comes out of it.</p>

          <p><strong>What does PLOS&rsquo; vision for Open Science mean to you?</strong></p>
<p>JD: There is growing support for the idea that knowledge production and dissemination should be more inclusive. How we actually operationalize that ideal is the challenge that PLOS is tackling, and I&rsquo;m excited by the opportunity to both learn from and support those efforts.</p>

<p><strong>What specific expertise do you bring to PLOS Water?</strong></p>



<p> JD: I&rsquo;ve been teaching and carrying out research in the water and sanitation field for more than 20 years. Most of my group&rsquo;s work has been in countries in Africa, Asia, and Latin America. Having the opportunity to examine issues across a variety of contexts has really shaped the way I think about research design and the interpretation of findings </p>

<p><strong>What is the most exciting part of your job as an Editor-in-Chief?</strong><br><br>PH: Most of us are aware of the challenges we face in terms of planetary resources and inequality, and the inadequacies of our existing institutions to tackle them meaningfully.  Since journals are institutions that structure the delivery of knowledges, we have both responsibilities and opportunities in this regard. The most exciting part of my job as Co-Editor-in-Chief is to be equally attentive to each of these many ways of knowing. Sometimes that will involve challenging our societal and organisational structures.<br><br>JD: Working with my Co-EIC Pierre Horwitz to develop a vision for PLOS Water that catalyzes cross talk between the water services and water resources communities, and that supports historically under-represented researchers in publishing their work. I&rsquo;ve also loved meeting new colleagues and learning about their work&ndash;there is an amazing amount of scholarship in the water field!<br><br><strong>What will PLOS Water add to the field in the coming decade?</strong><br><br>PH: Water permeates, and is nearly universal in a disciplinary sense. The combined forces of industrialisation and population growth have meant a flourishing of types of water knowledge that belong, more often than not, to a set of languages and technologies. While they are essential coverage for the field of water, they have come at the expense of a diverse array of water knowledges that have been marginalised, and are more place-based, culturally defined, and ecologically literate. They include knowledges of Indigenous and local peoples, even formed over thousands of years and hundreds of generations, embedding understandings of water as the world has changed, and how societies have responded.<br><br>By addressing this imbalance, and providing a re-acquaintance for an international audience, while maintaining strong coverage of conventional and emerging fields, we may well be in a better position to contribute to a regenerative global agenda over the next ten years.<br><br><strong>What&rsquo;s a common misconception new authors have about the peer review or publication process?</strong><br><br>JD: I think some new authors may forget that reviewers, while very knowledgeable and typically more seasoned than they, are also colleagues in their scholarly community. Engaging them in constructive debate can benefit everyone.<br><br><strong>What developments are occurring in your field of expertise that excite you at this time?<br></strong><br>JD: First, increased data availability and advances in data science are expanding opportunities for measuring and monitoring water resources, services, and access. Ideally this will enable better management and policy choices. I&rsquo;m also excited to see a broader conception of health being incorporated into the water services arena. Evaluating effects of service deficits on, for example, mental health and the quality of child caregiving helps paint a more complete picture of the costs and benefits of water sector investments.<br><br>Want to know more about the journal and how to submit your research?

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/tiny-living-machines-xenobots-replicate-copies-frog-cells">Tiny living machines called xenobots can create copies of themselves</a></h4>

              
                <p>Tiny “living machines” made of frog cells can replicate themselves, making copies that can then go on to do the same. This newly described form of renewal offers insights into how to design biological machines that are self-perpetuating.</p>



<p>“This is an incredibly exciting breakthrough,” for the field of biologically based robotics, says Kirstin Petersen, an electrical and computer engineer at Cornell University who studies groups of robots. Robots that can copy themselves are an important step toward systems that don’t need humans to operate, she says.</p>



<p>Earlier this year, researchers described the behaviors of the lab-made living robots, called <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/frog-skin-cells-self-made-living-machines-xenobots">xenobots</a> (<em>SN: 3/31/21</em>). Plucked out of frogs’ growing bodies, small clumps of skin stem cells from frog embryos knitted themselves into small spheres and began to move. Cellular extensions called cilia served as motors that powered the xenobots as they cruised around their lab dishes.</p>



<p>That cruising can have a bigger purpose, the researchers now report in the Dec. 7 <em>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences</em>. As the xenobots bumble about, they can gather loose frog cells into spheres, <a href="https://www.pnas.org/content/118/49/e2112672118">which then coalesce into xenobots</a> themselves.</p>





<p>This type of movement-created reproduction, called kinematic self-replication by the researchers, appears to be new for living cells. Usually, reproducing organisms contribute some parental material to their offspring, says study coauthor Douglas Blackiston of Tufts University in Medford, Mass., and Harvard University. Sexual reproduction, for instance, requires parental sperm and egg cells to get started. Other types of reproduction involve cells splitting or budding off from a parent.</p>



<p>“Here, this is different,” Blackiston says. These xenobots are “finding loose parts, sort of like robotics parts in the environment, and cobbling them together.” Those collections then grow into “a second generation of xenobots that can move around like their parents,” Blackiston says.</p>

</div><figcaption>Living machines called xenobots are blobs of frog stem cells that knit themselves together. Scientists have now found that the bots can self-replicate. A C-shaped xenobot was most efficient at collecting loose stem cells in its opening, a behavior that leads to more of the mobile xenobots.</figcaption></figure>



<p>Left to their own devices, spheroid xenobots could generally create only one more generation before dying out, the researchers found. But with the help of an artificial intelligence program that predicted an optimal shape for the original xenobots, the replication could be pushed to four generations.</p>



<p>The AI program predicted that a C shape, much like an openmouthed Pac-Man, would be a more efficient progenitor. Sure enough, when improved xenobots were let loose in a dish, they began scooping up loose cells into their gaping “mouths,” forming more sphere-shaped bots. A mobile offspring took shape once about 50 cells had glommed together in a parent’s opening, Blackiston says. A full-bodied xenobot consists of about 4,000 to 6,000 frog cells.</p>



<p>Xenobots’ tiny size is an advantage, Petersen says. “The fact that they were able to do this at such a small scale just makes it even better, because you can start to imagine biomedical application areas,” she says. Minuscule xenobots might be able to sculpt tissues for implantation, for instance, or go inside bodies to deliver therapeutics to specific spots.</p>



<p>Beyond the possible jobs for the xenobots, the research advances an important science, one that has existential importance for humans, says study coauthor Michael Levin, a developmental biologist at Tufts. That is, “the science of trying to anticipate and control the consequences of complex systems,” he says.</p>



<p>“Originally, no one would have predicted any of this,” Levin says. “These things are routinely doing things that surprise us.” With xenobots, researchers can push the limits of the unexpected. “This is about a safe way to explore and advance the science of being less surprised by things,” Levin says.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/psychedelic-drugs-treatment-mental-health-disorders-depression">Can psychedelics meet their potential for treating mental health disorders?</a></h4>

              
                <p class="has-drop-cap" style="font-size:20px">Kanu Caplash was lying on a futon in a medical center in Connecticut, wearing an eye mask and listening to music. But his mind was far away, tunneling down through layer upon layer of his experiences. As part of a study of MDMA, a psychedelic drug also known as molly or ecstasy, Caplash was on an inner journey to try to ease his symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder.</p>



<p>On this particular trip, Caplash, now 22, returned to the locked bathroom door of his childhood home. As a kid, he used to lock himself in to escape the yelling adults outside. But now, he was both outside the locked door, knocking, and inside, as his younger, frightened self.</p>



<p>He started talking to his younger self. “I open the door, and my big version picks up my younger version of myself, and literally carries me out,” he says. “I carried myself out of there and drove away.”</p>



<p>That self-rescue brought Caplash peace. “I got out of there. I’m alive. It’s all right. I’m OK.” For years, Caplash had experienced flashbacks, nightmares and insomnia from childhood trauma. He thought constantly about killing himself, he says. His experiences while on MDMA changed his perspective. “I still have the memory, but that anger and pain is not there anymore.”</p>



<p>Caplash’s transcendent experiences, spurred by three therapy sessions on MDMA, happened in 2018 as part of a research project on PTSD. Along with a handful of other studies, that research suggests that when coupled with psychotherapy, mind-altering drugs bring some people immediate, powerful and durable relief.</p>

<p>Those studies, and the intense media coverage they received, have helped launch psychedelic medicine into the public conversation in the United States, England and elsewhere. Academic groups devoted to studying psychedelics have sprung up at Johns Hopkins, Yale, New York University Langone Health, the University of California, San Francisco and other research institutions. Private investors have ponied up millions of dollars for research on psychedelic drugs. The state of Oregon has started the process of legalizing therapeutic psilocybin, the key chemical in hallucinogenic mushrooms; lawmakers in other states and cities are considering the same move.</p>



<p>New ways to help people with PTSD, depression, anxiety and other mental health disorders are desperately needed. An estimated 30 percent of people with depression, for instance, don’t get relief from current treatments. Psychedelics, some researchers and clinicians believe, may help.</p>





<p>“The promise is incredible,” says Monnica Williams, a psychologist at the University of Ottawa, who ran the clinical trial Caplash participated in at UConn Health in Farmington. “Psychedelics have the potential to really completely revolutionize mental health and change everything.”</p>



<p>But a cloud of questions hovers over the research. It’s not known how the therapy works or who it might work for. Even if these new treatments perform well in clinical trials, the drugs, and the mind-bending experiences they bring, won’t appeal to everyone. What’s more, the drugs may not be available, or they may cost too much.</p>



<p>Psychedelic drugs, including MDMA, psilocybin and the hallucinogen LSD, which is also being studied as a treatment for depression and other mental health disorders, are illegal under federal law, classified as Schedule 1 substances by the U.S. government — with high potential for abuse and no currently accepted medical use. Many people may be reluctant to take an illegal drug that lowers their defenses and makes them vulnerable, no matter how great the promise of healing.</p>



<p>Social and legal hurdles, barriers to access and scientific questions make it unlikely that psychedelics will replace current mental health treatments, many experts agree. More likely is that with enough research, psychedelic substances will become another tool for doctors and therapists.</p>



<p>Caplash remembers what MDMA did for him right after his sessions. “I wasn’t as angry as I was before. My muscles were a lot less tense. I could literally see clearer,” Caplash says. “As I went through the study, I was also becoming a different person.”</p>



<p>The benefits are still with him. Caplash no longer thinks of suicide. A biology major at the University of Connecticut, he has big dreams and advocates for more accessible mental health care for others. “I feel like I’m at peace, to an extent,” he says. “I know who I am and what I want to do.”</p>





<h4>A winding path</h4>



<p>Psychedelic drugs are not new. Scientists at the pharmaceutical company Merck made MDMA in 1912. Swiss chemist Albert Hofmann synthesized LSD in 1938, and Aldous Huxley popularized his experience on mescaline, a psychedelic compound made by certain cacti, in his 1954 book <em>The Doors of Perception</em>. When people talk about the psychedelic renaissance, they often begin with Hofmann and Huxley, says Sutton King, who advocates to include Indigenous voices in discussions about psychedelics and is an Afro-Indigenous member of the Menominee and Oneida Nations of Wisconsin.</p>



<p>But the story of psychedelics starts long before then. Indigenous communities around the world have used psilocybin and other consciousness-changing compounds for healing for thousands of years.</p>



<p>“The traditional Indigenous Nations &#8230; have had these connections to these medicines,” says King, who is cofounder and president of the Urban Indigenous Collective, a nonprofit advocacy group in New York City.</p>



<p>Belinda Eriacho, a wisdom carrier of Dine’ (Navajo) and A:shiwi (Zuni) descent, believes that psychedelic drugs, called sacred plant medicines by some Indigenous groups, are catalysts to help align mental, physical, spiritual and emotional health. “We were the knowledge keepers,” she says. “A lot of our understanding about these medicines is through practical experiences. They are not something you can read in a book.”</p>



<p>But around the middle of the 20th century, medical researchers, dissatisfied with existing mental health treatments, began trying to quantify these drugs’ effects on mental states. A flurry of research yielded promising hints, but many of those early attempts didn’t yield solid data. Some experiments were poorly designed; worse, some were deeply unethical, forcing high doses of psychedelics on people who were incarcerated or experiencing psychosis. Many of those study subjects were people of color.</p>



<p>In the 1960s, social and political sentiments began turning against these drugs — and the counterculture they represented — in both non-Indigenous and Indigenous communities. The U.S. government criminalized the use of psychedelics to keep them out of the public’s hands. The new restrictions kept the drugs out of researchers’ hands, too.</p>

<h3>Changing minds&nbsp;</h3>



<p>Psilocybin can change brain activity, but it’s not clear if these shifts relate to mental health. In a study in healthy people, red and orange show where psilocybin boosted brain connectivity compared with a placebo. Those regions are important for handling information coming in from the senses.

<p>That social shift stigmatized the drugs and whatever promise they held, says neuroscientist Rachel Yehuda, who has studied PTSD for decades at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai in New York City. Current drug treatments for PTSD, such as antidepressants or sleep medications, don’t work well for some people, she says. These medicines may help with symptoms, but don’t get at the root of the problem. Psychedelics might do more, she’s come to realize.</p>



<p>Two years ago, when Yehuda began studying psychedelic drugs, she faced a lot of skepticism. But those dismissals have disappeared. “The general attitude in academic medicine right now is, ‘Gosh, let’s try it. Let’s see. Maybe it will be good. Wouldn’t that be nice?’ ”</p>



<p>In some ways, psychedelics can outperform approved psychiatric drugs such as Prozac and other selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, or SSRIs. And so far, the data suggest psychedelics work quickly, appear to be safe and have lasting effects, says Atheir Abbas, a psychiatrist and neuroscientist at Oregon Health &amp; Science University in Portland. “That is hard to come by. I think that is extremely exciting.”</p>



<p>In the last five years, a handful of high-quality, albeit small, studies have suggested tremendous benefits from the psychedelic psilocybin for depression, anxiety and PTSD. The studies differ in their details, but many follow a similar arc. Generally, the studies begin with talk therapy sessions, followed by several therapy sessions in which participants are under the influence of a psychedelic drug. More psychotherapy comes afterward. At certain points in the process, researchers measure the participants’ symptoms.</p>



<p>Psilocybin-assisted therapy <a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamapsychiatry/fullarticle/2772630">quickly reduced signs of depression</a> among 24 participants with moderate or severe depression, scientists reported in 2020 in<em> JAMA Psychiatry</em>. Four weeks after two psilocybin sessions, 71 percent of the participants had maintained a drop of at least 50 percent in their scores on a depression rating scale called the GRID-HAMD.</p>

<h3>Depression drop&nbsp;</h3>



<p>People who received two psilocybin sessions with psychotherapy had fewer symptoms of depression one week after their second dose, at week 5, and at week 8 than people who had not yet received the treatment. Error bars show the variation among individual responses.</p>

<p>Earlier work showed psilocybin could help with depression and anxiety in patients facing life-threatening cancer; <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0269881119897615">the benefits were still there about four years after the psilocybin treatment</a>, researchers reported in the <em>Journal of Psychopharmacology</em> in 2020.</p>



<p>MDMA therapy seemed to have similar effects in an international study of 90 people with PTSD. Two-thirds of those who got MDMA <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-021-01336-3#MOESM2">no longer qualified for a PTSD diagnosis at the end of the trial</a>, compared with about one-third of participants who received placebos. Those results appeared May 10 in <em>Nature Medicine</em>.</p>



<p>Collectively, the studies offer strong hints that psilocybin, MDMA and other psychedelic drugs can help in these research settings, says Scott Thompson, a neuroscientist at the University of Maryland School of Medicine in Baltimore. “All of them are giving the same sort of signal,” he says.</p>



<p>We’re in a moment when Western research is converging with the long history of Indigenous knowledge, King says. There is a place for both approaches, “two truths,” as King puts it, when it comes to helping people with psychedelic drugs.</p>



<p>King adds that the excitement coming from laboratories is accompanied by fear for some Indigenous people: fear of their ceremonies being appropriated, fear of worsening access to their medicines and fear of these substances being misunderstood. “It’s an exciting time, but it’s also a scary time for Indigenous peoples,” she says.</p>



<h4>The healing components</h4>



<p>One big question is how the various psychedelic drugs work. “If you look at all the knobs people are turning, it’s really not known what’s critical and what’s not,” Abbas says. The talk therapy that often goes with the drugs, the psychedelic trip or other drug effects could all be important.</p>



<p>Some people suspect that the psychotherapy is the healing component, not the drug itself. And plenty of data show that therapy works well for some people. Many of the key trials so far have been testing the drug in tandem with intense psychotherapy. Caplash, for instance, had multiple therapy sessions before, during and after his MDMA experiences. Similarly intense therapy sessions happened for people in the trial of psilocybin for depression. The drugs might make a person open to exploring some of the painful events of their past during therapy.</p>



<p>Others suspect that the psychedelic trip itself, the hallucinatory experience, is a crucial part of the treatment. That’s a hard question to study, but not impossible, Yehuda says. “We need the science to understand what transformation looks like, and how a drug facilitates it,” she says. “We’ve been afraid of studying the biology of altered states, or even consciousness, because it feels so wonky and so unscientific and so subjective and woo woo. But I think we should be up for this challenge.”</p>



<p>Other scientists are focusing on the actions of the drugs themselves, by looking inside the brain. Thompson, for instance, suspects that it’s possible to get the benefits and skip the trip by restricting cells’ responses to serotonin, a chemical messenger that’s thought to be involved in the hallucinations. His recent study in mice hints that this just might be possible.</p>



<p>In the mice, Thompson and colleagues blocked a sensor thought to spark psilocybin-related hallucinations. When this serotonin-detecting receptor, called 5-HT2A, was blocked, the mice appeared to stop tripping (their heads no longer twitched). Yet, psilocybin still had antidepressive effects on the mice, restoring a lost preference for sugar water. The result raises the idea that the <a href="https://www.pnas.org/content/118/17/e2022489118">antidepressant effects associated with psychedelics can come without the hallucination</a>s, the researchers reported in the April 27 <em>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences</em>.</p>



<p>If a similar thing could happen in people, “you could retain the benefits but block the trip,” Thompson says. “The trip is the thing that makes you have to spend all day in the hospital with a facilitator there, and makes it expensive, and keeps psychedelics from being widely used,” Thompson says. “Being able to block the trip would lower the barriers in many ways.”</p>



<p>Eriacho, who has used psychedelics for her own healing, says the holistic experience is what matters. Psychedelic medicines allow a person to go within, to the pockets of the mind where traumas lurk, and begin to heal. “That is what it’s done for me,” she says. But the ceremony, the ritual and the wider context were all keys to her healing.</p>

<h4>Who will benefit?</h4>



<p>The trials completed so far have been small and included mostly white volunteers. Williams and colleagues tallied participants in psychedelic studies from 2008 to 2017. Of the 282 people who took part (and for whom race or ethnicity data were available), <a href="https://bmcpsychiatry.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12888-018-1824-6#Tab1">just 50 were not white</a>, the researchers wrote in 2018 in<em> BMC Psychiatry</em>.</p>



<p>People of color have been underrepresented in these studies for many reasons, says Williams, who designed her study at UConn Health to specifically look at the effects of MDMA-assisted therapy in people of color. Caplash, who is Indian-American, was the first and only person to go through the process at UConn. Soon after his participation, the trial was stopped at that site. Other enrolled volunteers there were unenrolled, says Williams, now at the University of Ottawa.</p>



<p>“This is a very marginalized and vulnerable group,” she says. “There were fears that if anything really bad happened [during the trial], it would reflect very badly on the university.” UConn Health spokesperson Lauren Woods says that is false. The clinical trial was stopped for a “variety of reasons,” she wrote in an e-mail to <em>Science News</em>, declining to provide specifics.</p>



<p>Without strong efforts to create inclusive studies that actively recruit a diverse group of people into the trials, train therapists of color and consider racial trauma, psychedelic drugs will not be accessible to everyone who might benefit from them, Williams says. “This needs to be an important part of what we do,” she says. “We can’t keep doing it the same way it was done in the past.”</p>



<p>Yehuda aims to design treatments for “the populations who need it the most,” she says. That includes combat veterans with PTSD. She and her colleagues are beginning to enroll 60 veterans in a clinical trial at the James J. Peters Veterans Affairs Medical Center in the Bronx, N.Y., where Yehuda directs the Mental Health Patient Care Center. “We are hoping to enroll a lot of ethnically diverse and racially diverse people, because we already serve them,” Yehuda says. “We’ve done a lot of the trust work already.”</p>



<p>As part of her studies, Yehuda plans to get at the question of who the drugs might work for, and why, in part by scrutinizing biological differences between people who get relief from the psychedelics and people who don’t. “We’re going to ask these somewhat tougher questions,” she says. “There is going to be a science about who [MDMA] is particularly good for.”</p>



<p>Meanwhile, the people making laws and policies are impatient for the science to yield answers. In 2020, Oregon voters approved Measure 109, which provides a sanctioned way to offer people psilocybin-assisted therapy. The state’s Psilocybin Advisory Board, which includes doctors, scientists and even a mushroom biologist, has two years to figure out how the state will regulate that effort.</p>



<p>Abbas is on that advisory board. Speaking personally and not on behalf of that board, he says designing a system for psilocybin-based therapy is immensely complex. “It’s not just who, but it’s how you identify those folks, it’s how you regulate the providers, how you regulate the psilocybin.”</p>



<p>Though studies so far have mainly focused on the performance of psychedelic drugs from a scientific perspective, other considerations are important, too. Perspectives from Indigenous peoples will be sought out, Abbas says.</p>



<p>“There needs to be this meeting of the minds, and the openness that the scientific and Western way of thinking is not always the right way,” Eriacho says. Clinical trials, for instance, often rely on narrowly defined clinical surveys to capture symptoms. “Those are Western concepts,” she says, and from her perspective, those metrics miss a lot. “You don’t have a very comprehensive way of looking at what an individual may be experiencing,” she says.</p>



<p>What Oregon’s psilocybin program will ultimately look like is still anyone’s guess. The same is true for use of other psychedelics. There is no single story to be found amid all of these diverse and intersecting perspectives — Indigenous traditions, Western medicalization, social movements, eager private investors.</p>



<p>In the place of one story, we have many, including that of Kanu Caplash, who feels healed by an experience enabled by a psychedelic drug. His transformation was deeply personal. Yet it gives us a glimpse of something possible and powerful.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/covid-pill-merck-molnupiravir-antiviral-fda">Merck’s COVID-19 pill may soon be here. How well will it work?</a></h4>

              
                <p>Hopes for an easy pill that could combat COVID-19 before people land in the hospital have dimmed a bit. New data about an antiviral pill made by Merck with its partner Ridgeback Pharmaceuticals show it’s not as stellar as first believed. And the drug has drawbacks that could outweigh its potential to fight the coronavirus and keep people out of the hospital.</p>



<p>The U.S. Food and Drug Administration is now weighing whether to grant emergency use authorization for the drug, called molnupiravir, after the agency’s advisory panel narrowly voted to recommend it on November 30. The drug was <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/first-oral-antiviral-for-covid-19-lagevrio-molnupiravir-approved-by-mhra">authorized for use in the United Kingdom</a> on November 4. &nbsp;If the FDA follows suit, it could wind up being just a stopgap: Some advisers already have urged the agency to be ready to withdraw that authorization as soon as something better comes along.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coronavirus-covid-19-why-early-treatment-drugs">Finding an early treatment hasn’t been easy</a>, so many experts initially hailed the development of molnupiravir as a potential game changer for the pandemic: A pill that could be given to people early in the infection might help keep health care systems from being overwhelmed, and spare people at high risk from the most severe complications (<em>SN: 7/27/21</em>). </p>



<p>In a clinical trial, the drug showed <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coronavirus-covid-antiviral-pill-merck-molnupiravir-hospitalization-death">early signs of preventing hospitalization and death</a> from COVID-19 in people at high risk of severe disease (<em>SN: 10/1/21</em>). In fact, the results were so promising — a 48 percent reduction in the relative risk of hospitalization or death — that the trial was stopped so that the drug might potentially reach the public earlier.</p>





<p>But on November 26, Merck announced in a news release that when all the available data from the trial was in, the<a href="https://www.merck.com/news/merck-and-ridgeback-biotherapeutics-provide-update-on-results-from-move-out-study-of-molnupiravir-an-investigational-oral-antiviral-medicine-in-at-risk-adults-with-mild-to-moderate-covid-19/"> reduction in relative risk fell to 30 percent</a> against hospitalization and death compared with a placebo. The shift stemmed from an unexplained decrease in severe disease among people in the placebo group in the last part of the trial.</p>



<p>In data collected from May 7 through August 5, 53 of 377 people (or 14.1 percent) in the placebo group were hospitalized and eight died (2.1 percent). In the molnupiravir group, 28 of 385 people (7.3 percent) were hospitalized and none died.</p>



<p>But an FDA analysis of subsequent data showed that from August 6 through October 2, 15 of the 322 people (4.7 percent) in the placebo group were hospitalized and one died (less than 1 percent). Of the 324 people who got molnupiravir during that time period, 20 (6.2 percent) were hospitalized and one died (less than 1 percent), making molnupiravir appear to produce worse outcomes than placebo.</p>



<p>Overall, among the 709 people in the molnupiravir group, there were 48 hospitalizations and one death compared with 68 hospitalizations and nine deaths among the 699 people who got a placebo, dropping the effectiveness from the initial 48 percent to 30 percent.</p>



<h3>Split support</h3>



<p>Taking that lower-than-expected efficacy into account, the FDA’s antimicrobial drugs <a href="https://www.fda.gov/advisory-committees/advisory-committee-calendar/november-30-2021-antimicrobial-drugs-advisory-committee-meeting-announcement-11302021-11302021#event-materials">advisory committee</a> came to a <a href="https://www.fda.gov/advisory-committees/advisory-committee-calendar/november-30-2021-antimicrobial-drugs-advisory-committee-meeting-announcement-11302021-11302021#event-materials">split 13–10 decision</a> about whether the antiviral drug should be granted emergency use authorization, with experts on each side of the vote often agreeing with points made by the opposing side. The debate and vote reflected a storm of uncertainty about the drug’s efficacy and who should use it — the list of people who would not be eligible is far longer than those most experts would give the drug to. The panel also queried whether the drug could lead to even more dangerous versions of the coronavirus, whether it can cause growth delays in children or mutations in human DNA, and other unanswered questions.</p>

<p>Virologist John Coffin of Tufts University in Boston said during the FDA meeting that he’s dreamed of a small molecule drug that could effectively treat viral infections. “I’m not sure [molnupiravir] is the one we’ve been waiting for, but it’s all we’ve got at the moment.” He voted in favor of the drug but was among those urging the FDA to reconsider if better options become available.</p>



<p>Something better might already be on the horizon if an antiviral pill made by Pfizer lives up to its early promise of an 89 percent decrease in hospitalization and death compared with placebo if taken within three days of symptom onset. That drug works differently than molnupiravir and may not have the same safety concerns.</p>



<p>Another early treatment, lab-made <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/covid-19-coronavirus-antibodies-lab-treatment-immune-system">monoclonal antibodies, is already authorized</a> for use in nonhospitalized COVID-19 patients  (<em>SN: 9/22/20</em>). But that treatment has to be given intravenously, requiring a trip to an infusion center. Many people don’t have ready access to such a facility. Some new variants of the coronavirus can also evade some of these antibodies.</p>



<h3>Drug drawbacks</h3>



<p>Among the worries about authorizing molnupiravir is the possibility that the antiviral could spur evolution of more dangerous versions of the coronavirus. The antiviral pill works by making mutations in viral RNA so that viruses are rendered noninfectious and eventually stop replicating. Such mutations happen throughout the virus’s genetic instruction book, or genome.</p>



<p>Some of those mutations could land in the spike protein, which helps the coronavirus break into cells, or other proteins and make the virus more transmissible or more evasive to vaccines. That’s especially a fear if people don’t finish the full five-day course of the drug needed to render the virus inoperable, leading potentially to highly mutated new forms of the virus that could infect others.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“The potential for this drug to drive some very challenging variants into the public is of major, major concern,” said James Hildreth, an immunologist and president of Meharry Medical College in Nashville.</p>



<p>Merck representatives said that possibility is unlikely, because after five days of taking even a half dose of the drug, infectious viruses were no longer detectable among study participants tested. In one study, the company found seven patients who had changes in the coronavirus’s spike protein after taking molnupiravir, but there was no evidence that the viruses spread to other people or affected the patient’s health (none were hospitalized or died).</p>



<p>Molnupiravir might also create mutations in human DNA, researchers say. The drug is a nucleoside analog — an artificial RNA building block that can mimic the bases cytosine and uracil. Some enzymes in human cells might convert those RNA subunits to a DNA building block, which may lead to mutations in human DNA, especially in rapidly reproducing cells, such as blood cells. How likely that is is an open question.</p>



<p>Lab tests with bacteria and cells grown in lab dishes suggested that the drug might cause such DNA mutations under certain circumstances. But tests in animals suggested that the risk of such mutations actually happening in the body is low. To reduce the chance of such mutations happening, people would be able to take molnupiravir for no more than five days. That should be long enough to eliminate the virus but short enough not to cause lasting harm.</p>



<h3>Limited eligibility</h3>



<p>Animal studies have also indicated that molnupiravir might interfere with bone growth, so the drug probably would not be given to pregnant women or to children or adolescents. For three months, researchers gave rats doses of the drug nine to 15 times higher than people would receive. Those young rats had trouble converting cartilage at growth plates — tissue at the end of long bones that determines the bone’s future length and shape — into bone. But the problem wasn’t seen if rats were dosed for one month or if they got a dose similar to what people would get.</p>



<p>Such bone problems would not be an issue for adults, but more data are needed before giving the drug to kids or to pregnant women, experts say.</p>



<p>It’s also unclear whether the drug will help vaccinated people, or be effective against the delta variant. It’s efficacy also varied depending on a patient’s high-risk health condition. It was good at keeping people with obesity out of the hospital, but more people with diabetes ended up hospitalized while taking the drug than in the placebo group.</p>



<h3>Filling a need</h3>



<p>Still, there are no good remedies for people with mild to moderate COVID-19. Yet as of November 30, more than 82,000 people in the United States are being diagnosed with COVID-19 each day and more than 800 die. Those numbers are expected to increase as case counts surge in some parts of the country. The new <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/omicron-coronavirus-variant-vaccines-mutations">omicron variant might add fuel to that fire</a> if it proves more contagious than the currently dominant delta variant (<em>SN: 12/1/21</em>).</p>



<p>So even with all of molnupiravir’s drawbacks, federal regulators might decide a 30 percent reduction in hospitalizations and deaths is worth giving the drug temporary authorization.</p>



<p>The drug might be helpful for “the right patient population, the right virus at the right time,” said Lindsey Baden, an infectious diseases doctor at Brigham and Women’s Hospital in Boston who chaired the FDA’s advisory committee. “To me that at least suggests there are populations where there may be benefit.”</p>



<p>But more studies need to be done to address concerns about the drug, he said. “It’s the absence of data that makes many of us uncomfortable.”</p>



<p>President Joe Biden said December 2 during remarks laying out a plan to combat the omicron variant that the government has secured a supply of the drugs and, if authorized, will distribute them similarly to vaccines.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/southern-ocean-human-carbon-dioxide-emissions-sink-climate">The Southern Ocean is still swallowing large amounts of humans’ carbon dioxide emissions</a></h4>

              
                <p>The Southern Ocean is still busily absorbing large amounts of the carbon dioxide emitted by humans’ fossil fuel burning, a study based on airborne observations of the gas suggests. The new results counter a 2018 report that had found that the ocean surrounding Antarctica might not be taking up as much of the emissions as previously thought, and in some regions may actually be adding CO₂ back to the atmosphere. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>It’s not exactly a relief to say that the oceans, which are <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/ocean-acidification-food-web-nitrogen-fixing">already becoming more acidic</a> and <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/earth-oceans-storing-heat-record-breaking-amounts">storing record-breaking amounts of heat</a> due to global warming, might be able to bear a little more of the climate change burden (<em>SN: 4/28/17</em>; <em>SN: 1/13/21</em>). But “in many ways, [the conclusion] was reassuring,” says Matthew Long, an oceanographer at the National Center for Atmospheric Research in Boulder, Colo. &nbsp;</p>



<p>That’s because the Southern Ocean alone has been thought to be responsible for nearly half of the global ocean uptake of humans’ CO₂ emissions each year. That means it plays an outsize role in modulating some of the immediate impacts of those emissions. However, the float-based estimates had suggested that, over the course of a year, the Southern Ocean was actually a net source of carbon dioxide rather than a sink, ultimately emitting about 0.3 billion metric tons of the gas back to the atmosphere each year.</p>



<p>In contrast, the new findings, published in the Dec. 3 <em>Science</em>, suggest that from 2009 through 2018, the Southern Ocean was <a href="https://doi.org/10.1126/science.abi4355">still a net sink, taking up a total of about 0.55 billion metric tons</a> of carbon dioxide each year.</p>





<p>The 2018 study had used newly deployed deep-diving ocean floats, now numbering almost 200, that are part of a project called <a href="https://soccom.princeton.edu/">Southern Ocean Carbon and Climate Observations and Modeling, or SOCCOM</a>. Calculations based on data collected from 2014 through 2017 by 35 of the floats suggested that parts of the ocean were <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/southern-ocean-antarctica-absorbs-less-carbon-expected">actually releasing a great deal of carbon dioxide back into the atmosphere</a> during winter (<em>SN: 6/2/19</em>). That sparked concerns that the Southern Ocean’s role in buffering the impacts of climate change on Earth might not be so robust as once thought.</p>



<p>Long says he and other researchers were somewhat skeptical about that takeaway, however. The floats measure temperature, salinity and pH in the water down to about 2,000 meters, and scientists use those data to calculate the carbon dioxide concentration in the water. But those calculations rest on several assumptions about the ocean water properties, as actual data are still very scarce. That may be skewing the data a bit, leading to calculations of higher carbon dioxide emitted from the water than is actually occurring, Long suggests.</p>



<p>Another way to measure how much carbon dioxide is moving between air and sea is by taking airborne measurements. In the new study, the team amassed previously collected carbon dioxide data over large swaths of the Southern Ocean during three separate series of aircraft flights — one series lasting <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/blog/science-the-public/hippo-reveals-climate-surprises">from 2009 to 2011</a>, one in the winter of 2016 and a third in several periods from 2016 to 2018 (<em>SN: 9/8/11</em>). Then, the researchers used those data to create simulations of how much carbon dioxide could possibly be moving between ocean and atmosphere each year.</p>



<p>The float-based and aircraft-based studies estimate different overall amounts of carbon dioxide moving out of the ocean, but both identified a seasonal pattern of less carbon dioxide absorbed by the ocean during winter. That indicates that both types of data are picking up a real trend, says Ken Johnson, an ocean chemist at the Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute in Moss Landing, Calif., who was not involved in the research. “We all go up and down together.”</p>



<p>It’s not yet clear whether the SOCCOM data were off. But to better understand what sorts of biases might affect the pH calculations, researchers must compare direct measurements of carbon dioxide in the water taken from ships with pH-based estimates at the same location. Such studies are under way right now off the coast of California, Johnson says.</p>



<p>The big takeaway, Johnson says, is that both datasets — as well as direct shipboard measurements in the Southern Ocean, which are few and far between — are going to be essential for understanding what role these waters play in the planet’s carbon cycle. While the airborne studies can help constrain the big picture of carbon dioxide emissions data from the Southern Ocean, the floats are much more widely distributed, and so are able to identify local and regional variability in carbon dioxide, which the atmospheric data can’t do.</p>



<p>“The Southern Ocean is the flywheel of the climate system,” the part of an engine’s machinery that keeps things chugging smoothly along, Johnson says. “If we don’t get our understanding of the Southern Ocean right, we don’t have much hope for understanding the rest of the world.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/tiny-exoplanet-made-molten-iron-star">This tiny, sizzling exoplanet could be made of molten iron</a></h4>

              
                <p>A newly discovered exoplanet is really making astronomers prove their mettle. Planet GJ 367b is smaller than Earth, denser than iron and hot enough to melt, researchers report in the Dec. 3 <em>Science</em>.</p>



<p>“We think the surface of this exoplanet could be molten,” says astronomer Kristine Wei Fun Lam of the Institute of Planetary Research at the German Aerospace Center in Berlin.</p>



<p>Signals of the planet were first spotted in data from NASA’s TESS telescope in 2019. The small world swung around its host star every 7.7 hours.</p>



<p>Using data from TESS and the ground-based HARPS spectrograph at the European Southern Observatory in Chile, Lam and her colleagues measured the planet’s radius and mass. GJ 367b clocked in at about 0.72 times Earth’s radius and 0.55 times its mass. That makes it the first ultrashort-period planet — a class of worlds with years shorter than one Earth day and with mysterious origins — known to be smaller and lighter than Earth.</p>





<p>Using those measurements, the team then calculated the planet’s density: about 8.1 grams per cubic centimeter, or slightly denser than iron. A computer analysis of the planet’s interior structure suggests that 86 percent of it could comprise an iron core, with only a sliver of rock left on top.</p>



<p>Mercury has a <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/mercury-has-massive-solid-inner-core">similarly large core</a>, Lam notes (<em>SN: 4/22/19</em>). Scientists think that’s a result of a giant impact with another planet that stripped away most of its outer layers. GJ 367b could have formed after a similar collision. It could also have once been a gaseous planet whose <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/newfound-exoplanet-may-be-exposed-core-gas-giant">atmosphere was blasted off by radiation from its star</a> (<em>SN: 7/1/20</em>).</p>



<p>Whatever its origins, GJ 367b is so close to its star that it’s almost certainly covered in melted metallic lava now. “At 1400° Celsius, I don’t think it would be very nice to stand on it,” Lam says.</p>

                <p>With gratitude and sadness, we announce that arXiv’s executive director Dr. Eleonora Presani is stepping down, effective December 3, 2021. arXiv’s leadership team &#8212; Jim Entwood, Helen Wang, Alison Fromme, and Martin Lessmeister, along with Scientific Director Steinn Sigurdsson &#8212; will continue to direct arXiv’s operations.</p>
<p>&#8220;My experience at arXiv has been incredibly humbling,” said Dr. Presani. “Seeing the love that arXiv receives from the community, I am confident that, with the continued support of the Simons Foundation and our valuable members, arXiv will continue to grow sustainably and bring Open Science to the next level.&#8221;</p>
<p>Dr. Presani joined arXiv as the organization’s first executive director in its 30 year history. Just as New York City entered lockdown due to the pandemic, Dr. Presani brought energy and vision to the team, and, throughout her tenure, led major initiatives in technical improvements, funding stability, interoperability, and the author and moderator experience. Under her direction, arXiv responded quickly to the pandemic and brought on a new moderator to address the influx of COVID papers. Over the course of 2020 and 2021, the team updated the LaTeX compilation engine, and added user-friendly error reporting to ease the submission process for authors. Collaboration was encouraged with the launch of arXivLabs, which resulted in the integration of new community-developed features. Internally, the team developed a new system to encourage effective moderator collaboration, and also improved author communication with a new support platform. arXiv also introduced a new brand identity and logo, launched a new funding and member model that is on track to increase revenue, and garnered more than $600,000 USD in new donations.</p>
<p>With arXiv staff and advisory boards, Dr. Presani also laid the groundwork for the next year of work at arXiv, which focuses on technical stability, tools for effective moderation, financial sustainability, and interoperability. The arXiv leadership team has embraced this plan and is prepared to move forward with it throughout 2022.</p>
<p>&#8220;We will sorely miss Dr. Presani&#8217;s energy and drive at arXiv, and at the same time honour her commitment to making arXiv bigger than any one of us by serving the expanding arXiv community ever better,&#8221; said Dr. Ralph Wijers, professor of high-energy astrophysics at the University of Amsterdam and incoming chair of arXiv’s Scientific Advisory Board.</p>
<p>“On behalf of the arXiv Member Advisory Board, I would like to thank Dr. Presani for her many contributions to arXiv and for her support of the arXiv community. She has been the compass providing arXiv with direction and strategic focus, paving the way for a stronger and healthier organization, while ensuring arXiv continues to deliver on its commitment to the community. Thanks to her skills, energy and dedication, arXiv has a robust plan for moving forward as an organization and for addressing new and exciting challenges in support of worldwide scientific communication,” said Carol Hoover, Scholarly Communications and Licensing Librarian at Los Alamos National Laboratory Research Library, and Chair of arXiv’s Member Advisory Board.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2021/12/02/women-are-no-more-emotionally-turbulent-than-men/">Women Are No More Emotionally Turbulent Than Men</a></h4>

              
                <p><em>By </em><a href="http://emilyoliviareynolds.com/">Emily Reynolds</a></p>



<p>Women are commonly assumed to be more emotionally turbulent than men: moodier, more volatile, and more likely to experience rapid changes in affect across the course of the menstrual cycle. Aside from being the basis of many a sexist joke, this assumption has had an impact on research, with cisgender women excluded from research due to apparent fluctuations in mood.</p>



<p>Building on research exploring fluctuations in rodents, a team from the University of Michigan has looked more closely at such variability in humans. <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-021-00143-7">Their study</a> in <em>Scientific Reports </em>finds no difference in emotional variance between cisgender men and women, or between women who do and do not use oral contraception.</p>



<span id="more-44786"></span>



<p>Participants were cisgender men and women aged between 18 and 38. Some women were not on any form of oral contraception, while others were taking the pill. Every evening for the entirety of the 75-day study, participants rated how much they had experienced ten positive and ten negative emotions in the last day.</p>



<p>The team used this data to look at three key areas: how volatile each participant’s mood was, based on how much it varied from their average mood; their emotional inertia, or how much their mood on one day predicted mood the next day; and how cyclical their moods were, based on how frequently they experienced specific changes in mood.</p>



<p>The team found very little statistical evidence for differences between men and women on any of these measures (in fact, men showed slightly more variability in mood than women). Similarly, there was little evidence that women on oral contraception differed from women not using contraception.</p>



<p>This has significant consequences in research settings. As the team notes, cisgender women are being excluded from research because of a perception that their moods are unstable — but if this isn’t the case, as these results suggest, this could create opportunities for researchers looking at a great number of different topics.</p>



<p>More work needs to be done on the variability of moods for women on the pill. <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2014/jul/20/mood-swings-more-than-pms-contraceptive-pill-alice-roberts">Anecdotally</a>, the pill can cause serious mood swings, while some <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23219471/">research</a> has been <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/14710055/">done</a> on the link between the pill, mental health, and mood.</p>



<p>The team is not suggesting, however, that oral contraceptives (or endogenous hormones) play absolutely no role in mood. Indeed, the study compares differences in variation in men and women rather than looking at the specific impact of hormones on mood, and the team notes that  a combination of factors including diet, sleep, exercise, social interactions and other contexts can combine to influence variability in and volatility of mood. While our hormones undoubtedly play a part in how we feel, they are simply part of a wider tapestry of factors that may or may not have anything to do with our gender.</p>

<p><strong>Apparent cure for rabies</strong> — <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/medical-sciences-82"><em>Science News</em></a>, December 4, 1971</p>



<p>The painful and always fatal virus disease rabies may at last be licked — not with the traditional series of rabies vaccine shots that sometimes ward off the disease after a person has been bitten by a rabid animal, but by the timely use of relatively simple medical techniques.… As a result [a 6-year-old boy] is the world’s only known survivor of rabies.</p>



<h4>Update</h4>



<p>Though the boy was vaccinated, the shots — which have improved since the 1970s — didn’t prevent disease. Medical techniques used to treat him, including inserting a tube to help him breathe, giving seizure medication and draining fluid buildup on the brain, proved that rabies patients can survive. Yet the disease is still almost always fatal once people show symptoms. In 2004, a 15-year-old girl became the <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/one-million">first known unvaccinated rabies survivor</a> (<em>SN: 1/29/05, p.&nbsp;77</em>). Doctors treated her using the M­ilwaukee Protocol. This controversial method puts patients in a coma to <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/rabies-races-nerve-cells">protect the brain while the immune system mounts defenses</a>. But even with that treatment, most patients still die.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/omicron-coronavirus-variant-vaccines-mutations">What we know and don’t know about the omicron coronavirus variant</a></h4>

              
                <p>Another coronavirus variant has emerged, and with it comes a new wave of uncertainty and unanswered questions. Days after the news broke, we remain in an information vacuum, and in a prognostication whirlwind with even vaccine makers <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/omicron-unlikely-to-cause-severe-illness-in-vaccinated-people-biontech-founder-says-11638286176">contradicting</a> <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2021/11/30/omicron-moderna-ceo-vaccines-covid/">each other</a>. Finding answers like whether vaccines can thwart new variants takes time.</p>



<p>To quickly recap, late last week, researchers in South Africa and Botswana raised the alarm that they had detected a coronavirus variant with myriad mutations, many of which are in the part of the virus that helps it enter and infect cells. The World Health Organization quickly gave this highly mutated variant its own Greek letter — omicron — officially signifying it as a <a href="https://www.who.int/en/activities/tracking-SARS-CoV-2-variants/">variant of concern</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Omicron’s very emergence is another reminder that although many of us might think we are done with COVID-19, it is not done with us,” WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said at a special session of the World Health Assembly on November 29.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Omicron’s detection sparked a flurry of controversial travel bans to and from South Africa and surrounding countries, <a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/goatsandsoda/2021/11/30/1059780197/african-leaders-condemn-travel-restrictions-as-omicron-variant-spreads-globally">angering African leaders</a>. Yet these quick decisions are based more on disquiet than data.</p>





<p>Here’s what we know, and what we don’t know.</p>





<h3>What we know</h3>



<p>The list of things we <em>do</em> know about omicron is short. We know South Africa has had a big spike in COVID-19 cases — going from an average of less than 300 cases per day in early November to more than 2,000 by the end of the month. Researchers are in the midst of testing what share of those infections might be due to omicron. We know the variant has turned up in other places like Israel, the United Kingdom, Hong Kong and Australia. On December 1, the first case in the United States <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/media/releases/2021/s1201-omicron-variant.html">popped up in California</a>, in a vaccinated person who had recently returned from South Africa.</p>



<p>Some places in the United Kingdom and Europe have reported cases of omicron that aren’t linked to travel to southern Africa, suggesting the variant may have been spreading person-to-person in the community for around a month, says Müge Çevik, an infectious diseases physician and virologist at the University of St. Andrews in Scotland.</p>



<p>It’s a bit reminiscent of early 2020, when we first found out the coronavirus was spreading to countries outside China. Now that scientists know what they’re looking for, they’re finding it.</p>



<h3>What we don’t know</h3>



<p>What we <em>don’t</em> know about omicron is much, much greater. Most information, at this point, is speculation.</p>



<p>We don’t yet know if it is more transmissible than other variants or how well it might evade virus-attacking antibodies. We don’t know whether it might cause more severe disease or if symptoms might be milder. We don’t know where omicron emerged. (South Africa, one of the first places to detect it, has a robust surveillance program, making the country well-suited to spotting new variants. Not all countries do.) We don’t know how effective vaccines will be against it. We don’t know how likely reinfections might be.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And, ultimately, we don’t know how omicron might compete with the <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/delta-variant-studies-cdc-coronavirus-covid-pandemic">delta variant</a> (<em>SN</em>: 7/30/21). It’s possible that omicron could eventually overthrow delta as the dominant variant globally. It’s also possible that omicron won’t. It’s hard to come to any definitive conclusions from what’s going on in South Africa because cases there were already low when omicron sparked a spike, meaning there wasn’t much delta around to compete with anyway. What’s more, whether a variant takes off in specific places depends on what’s going on in those spots.</p>

<p>The fact that there were few cases in South Africa may have helped researchers there identify omicron much earlier than other places, Çevik says. It’s easier to identify and analyze clusters when cases are low than when there are lots of infections.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>With so many unknowns, patience and prudence are key. We won’t know the answers about immune evasion, for example, for at least a couple of weeks. Other answers, like disease severity, could take months. In the meantime, one thing never changes: Even when new variants emerge, we still have public health tools at our disposal to control their spread. Masks, social distancing, ventilation, testing and contact tracing are all variant-proof. These measures continue to work no matter how the virus might evolve.&nbsp;</p>



<h3>Why scientists are concerned about omicron</h3>



<p>That said, there are reasons why scientists are worried about omicron. On a molecular level, it’s got some red flags. They come from the variant’s<a href="https://covariants.org/variants/21K.Omicron"> unique constellation of mutations</a>. Omicron has around 30 changes in the spike protein, which the virus uses to break into cells, including some mutations found in or similar to other worrisome variants such as the highly infectious alpha and the world-dominant delta. About 20 other viral tweaks are scattered in other proteins that do things like help the virus<a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.10.029454v2"> replicate inside cells</a> or<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0163445320301869"> interfere with early immune responses</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Previous studies looking at some of the spike mutations in other variants are helping scientists make early guesses at the consequences some of these changes in omicron might have. For instance, omicron shares a mutation called P681H with the alpha variant that may help the virus<a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.08.04.455140v1"> transmit better from person-to-person</a> when combined with two additional changes. Studies done in dishes of cells hint that a combination of two other mutations called Q498R and N501Y may help the virus better<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41564-021-00954-4"> bind to the protein ACE2</a>, the virus’s doorway to enter host cells. There are also some missing amino acids in a region of the spike called the N-terminal domain. That part of the spike is a common target for immune proteins called neutralizing antibodies that stop the virus from breaking into cells, so mutations there can help the virus hide from the immune system.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But these early guesses are just that: guesses. We don’t know whether these mutations might have the same effect when combined. Altogether, so many changes might damage some of the virus’s abilities compared with other variants. Or they might not. It’s too early to tell.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“It’s hard for me to imagine this virus taking over [because] it has so many mutations in critical areas of the spike protein,”&nbsp;says virologist Yiska Weisblum of Rockefeller University in New York City. Still, studies hint that many of omicron’s mutations may help it dodge parts of the immune response. “It could take over just because of that,” Weisblum says, because it might infect vaccinated people, too.</p>



<p>It’s also too soon to say how exactly the virus accumulated so many mutations. Previous case studies have shown that people with <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coronavirus-covid-19-uk-variant-pandemic-spread">weakened immune systems can be infected for months</a> (<em>SN: 12/22/20</em>). In such cases, the immune system wages war on the virus but can’t eliminate the infection, allowing the virus to evolve in new ways that evade some of the immune system’s weapons, including antibodies. It’s possible that’s what happened with omicron. It’s also possible the virus may have accumulated mutations while flying under the radar in a country that doesn’t have the capacity for lots of genetic surveillance. It wasn’t until it spread to South Africa, where the country’s surveillance program — established long before omicron emerged — picked it up, that researchers knew it existed.&nbsp;</p>

<p>To see such a highly mutated virus may seem surprising. “However, when you have many infected people, millions of people, then something that is not likely becomes reality,” Weisblum says.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Months before omicron emerged, Weisblum, virologist Fabian Schmidt also of Rockefeller University and colleagues were curious how the immune system might do against a variant with lots of mutations. To figure it out, the researchers engineered an animal virus that doesn’t make people sick to <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-021-04005-0">sport a coronavirus spike with 20 mutations</a>. The team then tested whether antibodies could still stop the virus from infecting cells. They tested antibodies from people who had recovered from COVID-19, people who had been vaccinated and people who had recovered and been vaccinated. Neutralizing antibodies from people who’d recovered and been vaccinated <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coronavirus-vaccines-help-covid-infected-already-pandemic">could still attack that version of the virus</a> (<em>SN</em>: 8/19/21). Neutralizing antibodies from people who’d been vaccinated with two doses of an mRNA vaccine or previously infected only, however, didn’t recognize the virus very well.</p>



<p>Now, with omicron, it seems nature has gone and repeated the team’s experiment.&nbsp;Time will tell what nature’s results will look like. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>While the fact that neutralizing antibodies in Weisblum, Schmidt and colleagues’ experiment didn’t recognize the virus very well may seem bad, the good news is that the body has more than neutralizing antibodies at its disposal. Other types of antibodies will still bind to the virus, sending warnings to the immune system that the coronavirus has invaded. Immune cells called T cells can kill infected cells or kick parts of the immune system, including antibody-producing B cells, into high gear.</p>



<p>The vaccines still prepare the body for future fights with the coronavirus, Schmidt says, and should still give us some protection. Our bodies just might not be able to completely stop the virus from getting into cells in the first place.&nbsp;</p>



<h3>The role of vaccines</h3>



<p>Could boosters help? Scientists don’t know. We don’t yet know whether or not the additional shots might help people develop neutralizing antibodies that can still recognize even highly mutated variants like omicron, Weisblum says. With every exposure, whether from vaccination or infection, our bodies refine their troves of antibodies to better attack the virus. If omicron spreads around the world, booster shots could become crucial. Already, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention changed its recommendations on November 29 to say that <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/media/releases/2021/s1129-booster-recommendations.html">all adults <em>should</em> get a booster dose</a> (previously, it suggested that those 18 to 49 <em>may</em> get one, but now the agency has upped the sense of urgency). Some vaccine developers, including Pfizer and its German partner BioNTech and Moderna, are preparing to formulate omicron-specific vaccines, just in case, but those won’t be available for months.&nbsp;</p>



<p>More important than boosters, though, is getting vaccines to people who haven’t received a single dose. That includes the majority of people across Africa, where countries have vaccination rates that are far lower than other parts of the world. Scientists have warned for months that inequities in vaccine distribution <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/covid-19-global-inequity-vaccines-deaths-economy-pandemic">could give the virus a helping hand</a> by leaving large groups of people susceptible to infection (<em>SN</em>: 2/26/21).&nbsp;</p>



<p>“As I have said many times, the longer we allow the pandemic to drag on — by failing to address vaccine inequity, or to implement public health and social measures in a tailored and consistent way — the more opportunity we give this virus to mutate in ways we cannot predict or prevent,” the WHO’s Tedros said November 30 at a WHO member state information session.&nbsp;</p>



<p>For now, though, it’s a waiting game. We’re waiting to learn more about omicron — whether it will rise to dominance like delta or fade into history like alpha and beta. All we can do is wear our masks and be patient.&nbsp;</p>
