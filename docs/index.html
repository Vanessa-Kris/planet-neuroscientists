              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/volcano-hot-spots-shallow-heat-source-tectonic-plates-mantle">Some volcanic hot spots may have a surprisingly shallow heat source</a></h4>

              
                <p>Some of the world’s volcanic hot spots may be fueled by molten material that originates surprisingly close to Earth’s surface.</p>



<p>While some of the hottest spots are fueled by plumes of buoyant material welling up from deep within Earth, as expected, molten flows driving activity at the coolest hot spots may result from relatively shallow geophysical processes, a new study suggests.</p>



<p>A lot of our planet’s volcanic activity occurs at or near the edges of the <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/earth-plate-tectonics-volcanoes-earthquakes-faults">tectonic plates that make up Earth’s crust</a> (<em>SN: 1/13/21</em>). At mid-ocean ridges, which often form the boundaries between some tectonic plates, hot material wells up from the mantle — the hot, thick layer that lies between the Earth’s core and its crust — to create fresh crust.</p>



<p>But more mysterious volcanic activity also occurs in many locales in the middle of a tectonic plate, far from mid-ocean ridges, says Xiyuan Bao, a geophysicist at UCLA. The <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/five-explosive-things-2018-eruption-taught-us-about-kilauea">islands of Hawaii</a>, Ascension Island in the South Atlantic and the Pitcairn Islands in the South Pacific are just a few examples of volcanoes created by such activity (<em>SN: 1/29/19</em>).</p>





<p>Scientists suspect that many of these sites of isolated volcanism are fed by <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/hot-spot-deep-beneath-north-america-could-have-triggered-quakes">plumes of hot material</a> rising from deep within the mantle, somewhat akin to small packets of water rising to the surface in a pot of near-boiling water (<em>SN: 9/16/13</em>). But a new analysis by Bao and colleagues, described in the Jan. 7 <em>Science</em>, <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.abj8944">suggests that some of these isolated hot spots are fueled by material that isn&#8217;t as hot as expected</a>, casting doubt that volcanic activity there is driven by deep-mantle plumes. The results could help scientists figure out the mysterious processes unfolding at various sites of volcanism in the interior of plates.</p>



<p>“This study helps sort out which volcanic plumes are deep-seated and which are not,” says Keith Putirka, an igneous petrologist at California State University, Fresno who wasn’t involved in the work.</p>



<p>The team focused on 26 volcanic hot spots in oceanic areas that previous studies had suggested were fed by deep-mantle plumes. The researchers used seismic data to estimate the temperature of mantle material at various depths from 260 to 600 kilometers. In general, the hotter the material is, the slower that seismic waves travel through it.</p>



<p>The team then compared the temperature estimate for each hot spot with the average temperature of mantle material welling up at mid-ocean ridges. Because tectonic plates are pulling apart there, there’s no resistance to upwelling of hot rock from deep in the mantle. That, in turn, provides a baseline against which scientists can compare temperatures of rocks deep beneath isolated hot spots.</p>



<p>Temperatures at mid-ocean ridges average about 1388° Celsius (2530° Fahrenheit). For a dozen of the hot spots the team studied, deep-mantle material was more than 155° C warmer than mid-ocean ridge material, Bao and his team report. Material that hot is more than warm enough to rise to Earth’s surface, chew through overlying crust and create prodigious volcanic activity.</p>



<p>But for 10 hot spots, deep-mantle material ranged between only 50° C and 135° C warmer than mid-ocean ridge material, just warm enough to rise to the surface and through crust. And four of the hot spots were less than 36° C warmer than mid-ocean ridge material, which suggests the hot spot material wouldn’t be able to rise fast enough to sustain buoyancy and break through the crust. Other sorts of geophysical processes occurring closer to Earth’s surface are fueling volcanic activity at these 14 cool-to-middling hot spots, the researchers propose.</p>



<p>“The evidence for mantle plumes under most volcanic islands is lacking,” says Godfrey Fitton, a geochemist at the University of Edinburgh who wasn’t involved in the work. An alternate source of molten material, he suggests, could be areas where tectonic plates collided to help create past <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/evidence-falls-place-once-and-future-supercontinents">supercontinents</a> (<em>SN: 1/11/17</em>).</p>



<p>In those crumpled zones, Fitton explains, Earth’s crust would be thicker and thus help insulate the flow of heat from the mantle to the surface. The buildup of heat in the crust, in turn, could lead to local melting of carbonate-rich rocks that could fuel volcanism. In 2020, he and his colleagues suggested that such processes have <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0012821X2030090X">fueled volcanism</a> at hot spots off the western coast of Africa and off the northeastern coast of Brazil for the last 50 million years or more.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2022/01/plos-and-medrxiv/">One (more) small step for preprints, one giant leap for rapid and responsible sharing of medical research at PLOS</a></h4>

              
                <h2>New opportunities to preprint with PLOS and medRxiv</h2>



<p>We&rsquo;re delighted to announce that PLOS and Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory (<a href="https://www.cshl.edu/">CSHL</a>) are expanding our longstanding partnership to offer authors more options for sharing their research in preprint form. Beginning this month, three PLOS journals, <em>PLOS Medicine</em>, <em>PLOS Neglected Tropical Diseases</em>, and <em>PLOS ONE</em>, will offer authors the option to have their manuscript forwarded to the medicine-focused preprint server <a href="https://www.medrxiv.org/">medRxiv</a> for posting as a preprint.&nbsp;</p>



<h2>Why choose preprints?</h2>



<p>A preprint is a version of a scientific manuscript posted on a public server prior to or in parallel with formal journal peer review. As soon as it&rsquo;s posted, each preprint becomes a permanent part of the scientific record, citable with its own unique DOI. At PLOS, we see preprints as integral to our overarching <a href="https://plos.org/about/">mission</a> to accelerate progress in science and medicine.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Preprints give researchers more control over their scientific communications, so they can share the outcomes of their research when <em>they </em>are ready. Early, transparent research communication surfaces results sooner, increasing efficiency across the entire scientific system. Publicly posted preprints open opportunities for collaboration and feedback, accelerating peer review, democratizing who can participate in peer review, and offering insight into the peer review process which in turn increases trust in research. And for individual researchers, preprints can be a powerful tool for establishing priority, increasing readership, and enhancing grant, job and tenure applications.&nbsp;</p>



<h2>Responsible preprint posting with medRxiv</h2>



<p>Responsible preprint posting is essential, especially in fields that impact public health and welfare. medRxiv has worked closely with the editors of leading medical journals to develop a rigorous preprint screening process. Technical checks screen for non-scientific content, inappropriate language, plagiarism, and potentially identifying patient details, while volunteer researchers with related expertise assess each preprint to confirm that posting will not pose a risk to patients or public health. About 70% of submitted preprints pass this screening process and go on to be posted. A prominent notice appears on each preprint alerting readers to the peer review status of the post, and directing them to the final published article once it becomes available.</p>



<h2>Partnering to make preprint posting (even) easier</h2>



<p>At PLOS, we see preprints as an opportunity to improve scholarly communication, rather than a threat. As an organization, we have prioritized preprints and sought ways to make posting easy and convenient for our authors. In recent years, that has included accepting <a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2016/10/the-best-of-both-worlds-preprints-and-journals/">direct transfers from bioRxiv</a> and <a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2019/08/medrxiv-to-plos-direct-preprint-transfers/">medRxiv</a> for publication consideration at relevant PLOS journals, and offering authors the option to have <a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2018/04/one-small-step-for-preprints-one-giant-step-forward-for-open-scientific-communications/">preprints posted to bioRxiv on their behalf</a> right from the PLOS manuscript submission system.</p>



<p>Fourteen percent of all PLOS papers published in 2020 have an associated preprint&mdash;more than double <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2102.09066.pdf">the rate across scientific articles overall</a>. PLOS author adoption is driven primarily by authors of life science studies who have used our integration with bioRxiv since 2018. But PLOS receives an even greater volume of submissions in public health and medicine.&nbsp; Adding medRxiv alongside our existing bioRxiv integration will extend the ease of facilitated posting to more of the researchers and research communities we serve.</p>

                <p><strong>Note:</strong> PLOS published the following press release on January 6, 2022</p>



<p>SAN FRANCISCO &mdash; The Public Library of Science (PLOS) and Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory (<a href="http://www.cshl.edu/"><strong>CSHL</strong></a>) today announced an expansion of their longstanding partnership to offer authors more options for rapidly and easily sharing their research before publication in a journal. Beginning this month, three PLOS journals, <em>PLOS Medicine</em>, <em>PLOS Neglected Tropical Diseases</em>, and <em>PLOS ONE</em>, will offer authors the option to have their manuscript automatically forwarded to the preprint server <a href="https://www.medrxiv.org/">medRxiv</a> for posting as a preprint.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The practice of sharing preprints is becoming more prevalent in medicine, with <a href="https://zenodo.org/record/3955154#.YbD0fNDMI2x">more preprints posted since the beginning of 2020 than in the four previous years combined</a>. The COVID-19 pandemic has driven much of the increase in preprint sharing in medicine, and demonstrated the benefits of rapidly and responsibly sharing findings prior to traditional peer review.</p>



<p>&ldquo;Since 2018, through our partnership with CSHL, we have posted thousands of manuscripts as preprints on bioRxiv on behalf of researchers in the biological sciences,&rdquo; said Veronique Kiermer, Chief Scientific Officer, PLOS. &ldquo;I believe that our support, as publishers, has helped authors gain the confidence to share their results before formal publication. We are delighted to be extending this service to authors in the medical sciences, allowing important research results to be shared early and responsibly to accelerate research. It has never been more important.&rdquo;</p>



<p>&ldquo;PLOS has been a much valued partner in bioRxiv&rsquo;s transformation of communication among bioscientists,&rdquo; said&nbsp;John Inglis, co-founder of medRxiv and bioRxiv at CSHL<strong>.</strong> &ldquo;The further support of such an innovative publisher for medRxiv&rsquo;s service to the health science research community is immensely encouraging.&rdquo;</p>



<p>The medRxiv preprint server was launched by CSHL in June 2019 as a not-for-profit, community-based author service that is publisher-independent but integrated with many journals. &nbsp;It currently hosts more than 27,500 manuscripts from 153,000 researchers in 140 countries. PLOS is the first publisher to implement this &ldquo;journal-to-medRxiv&rdquo; integration via the Editorial Manager journal submission system and at the scale of <em>PLOS ONE</em>. <em>PLOS ONE </em>alone received more than 19,000 submissions in Public Health and Medicine in 2020.</p>



<p>Responsible preprint posting is essential, especially in fields that impact public health and welfare. MedRxiv has worked closely with the editors of leading medical journals to develop a rigorous preprint screening process. In-house screening looks for nonscientific content, plagiarism, potentially identifying patient details, and ethical approval statements, while volunteer researchers with relevant expertise assess each preprint to confirm that posting will not pose a risk to patients or public health.</p>



<p>PLOS is committed to enhancing the integrity of preprints and confidence in them as research outputs. A key part of its mission has been to act as a catalyst, not only demonstrating the viability of new models through its own operations but also supporting them elsewhere. PLOS has been successful in steadily increasing adoption of preprints by its authors. 14% of all PLOS papers published in 2020 have an associated preprint, a figure that is driven largely by authors of Life Science studies who have used our integration with bioRxiv. PLOS receives an even greater volume of submissions in public health and medicine, and adding medRxiv alongside our existing bioRxiv integration will extend the ease of facilitated posting to more researchers around the world.&nbsp;</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/success-fail-why-outliers-people-communities-nudges">Why do some people succeed when others fail? Outliers provide clues</a></h4>

              
                <p>Northern Somalia’s economy relies heavily on livestock. About 80 percent of the country’s annual exports are meat, milk and wool from sheep and other animals. Yet years of drought have decimated the region’s grazing lands. By zeroing in on a few villages that have defied the odds and maintained healthy rangelands, an international team is asking if those rare successes might hold the secret to restoring rangelands elsewhere.</p>



<p>Answering this question requires turning traditional data processing on its head. Statistically speaking, success stories like those Somali villages with sustainable grazing are the outliers, says Basma Albanna, a development researcher at the University of Manchester in England. “The business as usual is that when you have outliers in data, you take them out.”</p>



<p>Yet those outliers can hold vital information, say Albanna and others who use the “positive deviance” approach. They sift through data to find signals in what many deem noise. The researchers search for “deviants” — outliers in big datasets — to uncover why some individuals or communities succeed when others facing near-identical circumstances fail. Then, armed with these insights, the researchers develop strategies that help those in the languishing majority attain positive results.</p>



<p>Positive deviance has the potential to address a nagging problem, says Megan Higgs, a statistician and independent consultant in Bozeman, Mont. “In research in general we have an overemphasis on quantifying averages,” Higgs, the editor of the International Statistical Institute’s blog Statisticians React to the News, says. She notes that few people in a research pool may actually fit the average. Sometimes, averages obscure vital information.</p>





<p>Without approaches such as positive deviance that look at groups and individuals in the margins, “I just worry that we are missing a hugely important part of the picture,” Higgs says.</p>





<h4>Rebels among us</h4>



<p>The term “positive deviance” first appeared in the mid 1970s, but the approach did not gain traction until nearly two decades later. In 1990, Monique Sternin and her late husband Jerry Sternin, then aid workers with the humanitarian organization Save the Children, piloted a positive deviance project in Vietnam to address the country’s soaring rates of childhood malnutrition. Vietnamese government officials asked the couple to help communities without resorting to food handouts or other common, yet unsustainable, aid practices.</p>



<p>Instead, the Sternins sought to identify children in impoverished communities who remained well fed against tremendous odds. Working in four villages in Thanh Hoa province, which combined had 2,000 children under age 3, the Sternins trained villagers to weigh the children. The effort revealed that almost 70 percent of the children were malnourished; about half were at risk of death.</p>



<p>The couple then asked the villagers to identify children with healthier weights among the poorest families. Each village had a handful of families that fit the bill. “We went to talk to those people,” says Monique Sternin, now a positive deviance consultant in Boston, Mass.</p>



<p>The Sternins discovered that kids with healthier weights came from families who fed their children tiny shrimp and crabs that lived in rice paddies and potato greens found along roadsides. Village wisdom regarded these foods as “taboo,” or dangerous, Sternin says. The families with healthier kids also fed their children three to four meals per day instead of the customary two meals.&nbsp;</p>



<p>On the surface, the solution seemed simple: Get more families to feed their children these taboo foods. But implementing this solution was not at all easy. “The positive deviants are outliers, rebels,” Sternin explains. The Sternins could not ethically “out” families that were bucking social norms and traditions.</p>



<p>Instead, they promised villagers free rice. In exchange, villagers attended cooking sessions with their kids, facilitated by aid workers and taught by village women. Those sessions provided villagers with an extra meal every day for 12 days. But to participate, the villagers had to bring and take turns preparing the tiny shrimp and crabs, along with wild greens. Over those 12 days, parents and caregivers saw for themselves that the foods made the children healthier, not sicker.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>

<p>Although <a href="https://hbr.org/2000/01/the-power-of-positive-deviancy%20%20https:/www.jstor.org/stable/jcorpciti.5.57">their work</a> was not based on a formal study, “what we found quickly was children were putting on weight,” Sternin says. And the children stayed healthy thanks to their altered diets — after a year, more than a thousand children in the villages were no longer malnourished.</p>



<p>The couple went on to establish similar programs around the country. Others adopted this method, and today, similar nutrition programs exist worldwide.</p>



<h4>Going bigger</h4>



<p>The Sternins’ work was inspirational, but required a personalized approach to gather data. Albanna wondered if big data, such as government surveys, satellite images and social media content, coupled with qualitative research, could get the job done with lower start-up costs.</p>



<p>Big data offers several benefits, Albanna explains. The datasets already exist, so the process is initially less labor intensive than going door to door. Identifying outliers at the level of villages or neighborhoods instead of individuals reduces privacy concerns.</p>



<p>Large datasets also reduce the risk of selecting those who got ahead through luck. “Positive deviants are very rare to find. We’re talking 2 to 10 percent of whatever sample you are investigating,” Albanna says. So the larger the dataset, the more positive deviants you would be able to identify, she notes.</p>



<p>In 2019, Albanna and several international partners cofounded the Data Powered Positive Deviance collaborative. <a href="https://static1.squarespace.com/static/614dae085246883818475c39/t/619f7f163ed02a77d13fd1bd/1637842759939/DPPD+Handbook+Nov+2021.pdf">Pilot projects</a> in the collaborative are identifying the safest public spaces for women in Mexico City and mapping communities producing the most millet in Niger. A project locating districts that were best at <a href="https://www.mdpi.com/1660-4601/18/18/9765/htm">stopping the spread of COVID-19</a> in Germany reported its findings in September in the <em>International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health</em>. The collaborative also conducts the Somalia healthy rangeland project.</p>



<p>In Somalia, the team first had to find successful villages. “We started, hoping that we would be able to identify communities that are able to sustain and maintain the numbers of their livestock after the 2016-2017 drought,” Albanna says. That drought was <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/more-extreme-weather-events-caused-human-driven-climate-change">severe</a>, leaving more than half the country with food shortages (<em>SN: 1/19/19, p. 7</em>).</p>



<p>Counting livestock directly proved tricky. So the team focused on a different metric: Rangeland health. Healthy vegetation likely makes for healthier livestock, Albanna explains.</p>



<p>The team then zoomed in on 314 villages in northern Somalia’s mountainous West Golis region and looked at three sets of data. The researchers grouped similar villages together using rainfall and land cover data. Earth-observing satellite data from 2016 to 2020 provided a gauge of vegetation density. That process helped them identify 13 potential positive deviants, villages that had maintained healthier vegetation despite the drought.</p>



<p>Detailed satellite images of those outliers revealed unique conservation techniques that helped preserve nearby rangeland. For instance, some villages used shrub barriers around settlements to limit erosion or carved half moon-shaped basins into landscapes to retain water, the <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352728521000324">researchers reported</a> online December 24 in <em>Development Engineering</em>. </p>



<p>To find out what propelled the villagers to adopt those successful practices, the team sent a local pastoralism and rangeland consultant, Mohamed Jama Hussein, to sleuth around. Hussein compared 10 of the potential positive deviant villages with two villages showing average levels of vegetation density and eight hard-hit, low-vegetation villages — the negative deviants. He discovered that the leaders of positive deviant villages had aggressively blocked private citizens from enclosing communal lands for personal use. By contrast, “squatting” on public lands remained common in the other villages.</p>



<p>Hussein also observed that farmers in the successful villages were moving away from the purely pastoral life to diversify their sources of income. Some villagers had started growing their own crops and even livestock feed. Many women, meanwhile, had started keeping bees, which offered an unexpected perk, Albanna says. The bees’ presence deterred people from cutting down rangeland shrubs and trees for fuel.</p>

<h4>Targeted interventions&nbsp;</h4>



<p>Besides giving researchers and policy makers the information they need to design new interventions, the positive deviance approach can also strengthen existing interventions, says behavioral science and public policy expert Kai Ruggeri of Columbia University in New York.</p>



<p>“It’s such an easy adaptation that could potentially have major impact,” says Ruggeri, who wrote a commentary <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/17456916211017865">encouraging researchers</a> to consider using the positive deviance approach in November 2021 in <em>Perspectives in Psychological Science.</em></p>



<p>Consider nudges, a popular intervention that relies on simple tools to change behavior, wrote Ruggeri and coauthor Tomas Folke, a computer scientist at Rutgers University in New Brunswick, N.J. Researchers have tested if nudging people with reminders to attend their doctor appointments can reduce no-shows. For instance, a study published in 2011 in the <em>Journal of Telemedicine and Telecare </em>showed that, across 29 studies, automated recordings or text messages <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3188816/">increased attendance by 29 percent</a>. </p>



<p>But when another research team, which included Ruggeri, scoured the electronic medical records of almost <a href="https://bmchealthservres.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12913-020-05097-6">64,000 low-income urban patients</a>, who can miss up to 45 percent of their appointments, a robocall followed by a text message failed to increase attendance. Those results were published in April 2020 in <em>BMC Health Services Research.</em></p>



<p>Nudge interventions often target the average participant, Ruggeri says. “If you look at the way nudging is largely done, it speaks to a middle-class-and-above population.” But researchers attempting to shrink societal inequalities could use a positive deviance approach to help the neediest individuals, Ruggeri says.</p>



<p>In the above examples, that would mean identifying low-income participants who did go to the doctor after receiving an automated reminder. Mapping those individuals’ paths could potentially lead to nudges and other behavioral interventions targeting potential no-shows in similar situations. That way, Ruggeri says, policy makers could reach the cohort most likely to benefit from preventive care.</p>



<p>That is the hope in Somalia, where Hussein wrapped up his fieldwork a few weeks ago. The team is now investigating how to use their newfound knowledge of successful outliers to develop behavioral and policy interventions.</p>



<p>Such interventions have an added benefit: They empower communities to harness the wisdom of their own people, Sternin says. The solutions exist within the community and implementing those solutions, she notes, “is transformational.”&nbsp;</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/antiprotons-protons-matter-antimatter-differences-physics">Antiprotons show no hint of unexpected matter-antimatter differences</a></h4>

              
                <p>It’s confirmed: Protons and antiprotons are well-matched. The two types of subatomic particles mirror each other in the ratios of their electric charge to mass, a new extremely precise experiment verifies.</p>



<p>Antiprotons are the antimatter counterpart of protons. Every type of matter particle has such an alter ego, with similar properties but opposite electric charge. But antimatter is an enigma: Scientists still don’t understand why matter is common in the universe while <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/mounting-evidence-suggests-neutrinos-are-key-why-antimatter-is-rare">antimatter is rare</a> (<em>SN: 11/25/19</em>). To investigate the origins of this asymmetry, scientists keep checking, to ever greater precision, for differences between matter and antimatter particles, which could hint at how matter came to dominate the cosmos.</p>



<p>The Baryon Antibaryon Symmetry Experiment, or BASE, at the European particle physics laboratory CERN, near Geneva, measures the oscillations of a single antiproton confined within an electromagnetic trap. These oscillations, which reveal the charge-to-mass ratio of the antiproton, are compared with those of a trapped hydrogen ion, comprising a proton and two electrons, which give the proton charge-to-mass ratio.</p>



<p>After more than 24,000 of these oscillation comparisons, BASE researchers found that the two <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-021-04203-w">charge-to-mass ratios mirror one another</a> with a precision of 1.6 billionths of a percent, the team reports January 5 in <em>Nature</em>. That’s more than four times as precise <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/antimatter-doesnt-differ-charge-mass-expectations">as the previous measurement</a> (<em>SN: 8/12/15</em>). </p>



<p>The result also tests physicists’ understanding of gravity’s effect on antimatter, says Stefan Ulmer, a spokesperson of BASE and physicist at RIKEN in Wako, Japan. The Earth’s gravitational environment changes as the planet orbits the sun, so if gravity affected protons and antiprotons differently, that effect would have surfaced during the year and a half over which the data were taken. “We have shown that antimatter and matter interact with gravity … in an exactly identical way,” to within an uncertainty of 3 percent, Ulmer says.</p>

<p><a href="https://bookshop.org/a/21798/9781524747558">Feeling &amp; Knowing</a><br><em>Antonio Damasio<br>Pantheon, $26</em></p>



<p>Neuroscientist Antonio Damasio believes that the link between brain and body is the key to understanding consciousness. In his latest book, <em>Feeling &amp; Knowing: Making Minds Conscious</em>, he explains why.</p>



<p>Consciousness is what gives an individual a sense of self; it helps one stay in the present, remember the past and plan for the future. Many scientists have argued that consciousness is created by vast networks of nerve cells, or neurons, in the brain. While it’s clear that the brain plays a major role in conscious experiences, it doesn’t act alone, argues Damasio, director of the University of Southern California’s Brain and Creativity Institute.</p>





<p>Instead, he argues, consciousness is generated by a variety of structures within an organism, some neural, some not. What’s more, feelings <em>— </em>mental experiences of body states — help connect the brain to the rest of the body. “The&nbsp; feelings that we have of, say, hunger or thirst, or pain, or well-being, or desire, etc. — these are the foundation of our mind,” Damasio says. In his view, feelings have played a central role in the life-regulating processes of animals throughout the history of life.</p>



<p>In <em>Feeling &amp; Knowing</em>, Damasio suggests that consciousness evolved as a way to keep essential bodily systems steady. This concept is also known as homeostasis, a self-regulating process that maintains stability amid ever-changing conditions. Consciousness emerged as an extension of homeostasis, Damasio argues, allowing for flexibility and planning in complex and unpredictable environments.</p>



<p><em>Science News </em>spoke with Damasio about why feelings are crucial to understanding consciousness, why consciousness is not exclusive to humans and whether it’s something a computer could ever have. The following conversation has been edited for clarity and brevity.</p>





<p><em><strong>SN</strong></em><strong>:</strong><strong> Why is understanding homeostasis so crucial to understanding consciousness?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Damasio</strong>: Homeostasis is central to the entire operation. It&#8217;s why we developed consciousness. Once we access feeling, we can then get a mental picture of how the state of life really is in our organism. So, we can get a warning that things are going wrong, and we get suffering. Or, we get a signal that things are reasonably OK, and we can afford to do other things, which is what happens with positive feelings. So I can afford to have this conversation with you because I’m not having a fever; I’m not terribly thirsty, hungry, or I’m not in pain.</p>



<p><em><strong>SN</strong></em><strong>: </strong><strong>How do feelings help </strong><strong>an organism manage life?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Damasio: </strong>Feelings are representations of the state of your body. To have a feeling of pain, pleasure, well-being, sickness, thirst, hunger or desire is to generate a picture of some parts of your organs. For example, the feeling of well-being is related to parameters that you can locate and measure. This is something that we can analyze; we can actually study it in the laboratory. A lot of what would be described as [the feeling of] well-being is related to the simple musculature that is around blood vessels in organs, like the stomach, the gut and so forth. And even muscular skeletal components of our body, how they are: Are they contracted? Are they distended, a large part, or not so much? What we are feeling from well-being is, in fact, describing states of our body; that&#8217;s what feelings are about. So the root of feeling in the state of the organism is unquestionable.</p>



<p><em><strong>SN: </strong></em><strong>How did the nervous system enable the coordination of diverse systems in the body?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Damasio: </strong>Once organisms became more and more complex, it was very difficult to maintain coordination [among respiration, digestion and other systems]. Having a system that runs a survey of the whole organism is a great advantage. With that master coordinator, the nervous system<em>,</em> came the possibility of generating [internal] representations [of one’s self]. We had to have nervous systems to have some kind of mapping of different parts of the body. Out of that, an image was generated, and a new development, which is a mind connected to the body. The entire story of consciousness is really a story that the body is telling about itself. Consciousness did not emerge from the get-go. It was not available, for example, in bacteria, or very simple organisms.</p>



<p><strong><em>S</em></strong><em><strong>N:</strong></em><strong> You</strong><strong> argue that consciousness is unlikely to be exclusive to humans.</strong><strong></strong></p>



<p><strong>Damasio: </strong>Right. We have different lineages in evolution, but it doesn&#8217;t mean that other creatures don&#8217;t have the possibility of getting to consciousness. Take, for example, the octopus. They have extremely complex behaviors. I would be flabbergasted if someone said they are not conscious. They have all the hallmarks of creatures that were able to develop a mind and have a sense of who they are and an awareness of how to protect themselves.</p>



<p><em><strong>SN: </strong></em><strong>In the future, could machines and computers be conscious?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Damasio:</strong> For robots to be conscious, we would need to give them a bit of vulnerability that they don&#8217;t have [right now]. If you could introduce into a computer something that would be homeostatic and regulatory <em>— </em>that would allow it to sense deviations <em>—</em> then you would be on the way to creating feelings for the computer, and it could detect its own inner states.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/blastoid-stem-cells-fertility-research">‘Blastoids’ made of stem cells offer a new way to study fertility</a></h4>

              
                <p>Newly created “blastoids” could give scientists a faster and simpler way to research embryonic development than using fertilized human eggs.</p>



<p>Made of human stem cells, these blastoids are the most developmentally accurate model yet for studying how the blastocyst — a structure present at an early stage of embryonic development — grows and implants into the lining of the uterus, researchers report December 2 in <em>Nature</em>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Conducting research on human embryos, which are often in short supply, is highly regulated and controversial. But lab-made blastoids can avoid some of those hurdles. While blastoids <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-021-03372-y">have been created before</a>, the researchers argue <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-021-03356-y">those models</a> don’t replicate blastocyst cells as well as the new blastoids do. What’s more, the team has already used its blastoids to reveal molecules that could be candidates for new contraceptives and fertility treatments.</p>



<p>A week after fertilization, developing human embryos implant into the uterus using a blastocyst, a spherical envelope of cells surrounding the cells that will become the embryo. To replicate this process, the team led by stem cell biologist Nicolas Rivron at the Institute of Molecular Biotechnology of the Austrian Academy of Sciences in Vienna looked to lab-grown human stem cells.</p>





<p>The researchers chemically inhibited molecular pathways involved in the cells’ growth and the timing of life cycle events. As a result, <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-021-04267-8">the cells formed blastoids</a> that had the same three cell types found in blastocysts.&nbsp;</p>



<p>When the team put the blastoids on lab-grown cells from the lining of the uterus, the spheres adhered to the surface, re-creating a crucial step in early pregnancy. And the researchers identified a compound that prevents blastoid attachment as well as one that encourages it, revealing their potential as nonhormonal contraceptives or fertility treatments.</p>



<p>These blastoids aren’t thought capable of developing into humans. Still, the team did not let the models develop past 13 days, in accordance with guidelines for <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/mysteries-reproduction-parenthood-ivf-fertilization">human embryos</a> that cap research on their development at two weeks of existence (<em>SN</em><em>: 6/9/21</em>).</p>

              <h4><a href="https://vanessa-kris.github.io/week5-blog-post.html">Week5 Blog Post</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Hi again!</h2>
<p>This should be a very interesting one, let's dive right into it...</p>
<h4>What makes Fedora packaging project exciting?</h4>
<p>Well...Anyone can be a package maintainer (cool right?!)  yes you must not know how to code! You just need to be willing to learn and be persistent.</p>
<p>This particular project is not just exciting but important as well</p>
<h4>How?</h4>
<p>RPM is an open source program for installing, uninstalling and managing software packages in Linux.</p>
<h4>So here's how this works</h4>
<p>RPM packaging helps you install softwares using a simple command line ...
let's use chrome for an example.</p>
<h4>Steps to install chrome using the Fedora Linux Terminal</h4>
<p>Install Third Party Repositories</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code>$ sudo dnf install fedora-workstation-repositories
</code></pre></div>

<p>Enable the Google Chrome repo</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code>$ sudo dnf config-manager --set-enabled google-chrome
</code></pre></div>

<p>Finally, install Chrome</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code>$ sudo dnf install google-chrome-stable
</code></pre></div>

<h2>How Packages Are Made</h2>
<p>Fedora docs gives us detailed expalanations so let's get right into it.</p>
<h4>Getting started</h4>
<p><a href="https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/package-maintainers/Joining_the_Package_Maintainers/">https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/package-maintainers/Joining_the_Package_Maintainers/</a></p>
<h4>Setting up envirnonment / Building the RPM</h4>
<p><a href="https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/package-maintainers/Packaging_Tutorial_GNU_Hello/">https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/package-maintainers/Packaging_Tutorial_GNU_Hello/</a></p>
<p><a href="https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/package-maintainers/New_Package_Process_for_New_Contributors/">https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/package-maintainers/New_Package_Process_for_New_Contributors/</a></p>
<h4>Creating a review request</h4>
<p><a href="https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/package-maintainers/New_Package_Process_for_New_Contributors/#create_your_review_request">https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/package-maintainers/New_Package_Process_for_New_Contributors/#create_your_review_request</a></p>
<h4>Add package to source code management (SCM)</h4>
<p><a href="https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/package-maintainers/New_Package_Process_for_New_Contributors/#add_package_to_source_code_management_scm_system_and_set_owner">https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/package-maintainers/New_Package_Process_for_New_Contributors/#add_package_to_source_code_management_scm_system_and_set_owner</a></p>
<p>And for another interesting part. When packages are made, after a period of time the spec files needs to be updated, and here's how packages are updated.</p>
<h2>RPM Package Updates</h2>
<h4>1) Fork the project from upstream</h4>
<p>Forking the project simply means creating a copy of the upstream project for yourself. That way you can make modifications without affecting the original project.</p>
<h4>2) Create a pull request (PR)</h4>
<p>After making modifications to your copy of the project (fork), you may want to add those changes to the main project (upstream). In that case you create a PR and wait for your changes to be merged to the main project (upstream)</p>
<h4>3) Build for the Fedora system</h4>
<ul>
<li>Clone your project</li>
</ul>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code>fedpkg co &lt;package name&gt; 
</code></pre></div>

<ul>
<li>Navigate to the Project directory</li>
</ul>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code>cd &lt;package name&gt; 
</code></pre></div>

<ul>
<li>Because the repo is up to date for rawhide after the PR is merged, we just build</li>
</ul>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code>fedpkg build 
</code></pre></div>

<ul>
<li>For other branches: f35/f34</li>
</ul>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code>fedpkg switch branch &lt;branch name&gt;
</code></pre></div>

<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code>git merge rawhide
</code></pre></div>

<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code>git push
</code></pre></div>

<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code>fedpkg build
</code></pre></div>

<ul>
<li>Push the update using the <a href="https://bodhi.fedoraproject.org/updates/new">bodhi web</a> interface because you can choose both the f35 and f34 builds and select the bug ID etc. all at once there.</li>
</ul>
<p>Before the outreachy program I didn't know softwares are even packaged by people :smile: I thought we had bots doing all the work. 
Fedora is just like any other Linux distro like Ubuntu, Manjaro and the likes, but fedora has its own unique commands.</p>
<p>Some packages takes longer than the others to finish because it is an endless journey of learning . Through this exciting journey I learnt how to set up my Fedora work station, how to package, and i feel this great fufilment that i am contributing to the society and to open source! Thank you Outreachy. </p>

                <p>A handful of small, nocturnal geckos have spilled their guts for science, revealing how the creatures get by in a part of Earth’s hottest landscape.<br><br>Surface temperatures in the Lut Desert in Iran, home to the Misonne’s spider gecko (<em>Rhinogecko misonnei),</em> soar past 65° Celsius more frequently than anywhere else on the planet. The extreme heat makes it difficult for life to thrive, and for years, ecologists have regarded the desert as mostly barren.</p>



<p>To find out how the geckos sustain themselves in this desolate oven, entomologist Hossein Rajaei of the State Museum of Natural History in Stuttgart, Germany and colleagues analyzed the stomach contents of six geckos using <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/blog/wild-things/scientists-find-crab-party-deep-ocean">DNA metabarcoding</a> (<em>SN: 4/18/16</em>). The technique compares chunks of DNA with a species identification database, like a bar code scanner in a grocery store. “It’s very accurate, very comprehensive and very trustable,” Rajaei says.</p>



<p>Within the geckos’ digestive soup stewed DNA from 94 species, about <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/jzs.12558">81 percent of which hail from outside the Lut Desert</a>, the team reports November 18 in the <em>Journal of Zoological Systematics and Evolutionary Research</em>.</p>



<p>The majority of these outsiders were winged insects such as flies, moths and wasps that migrate through the desert from bordering temperate landscapes. The remaining species — arachnids, arthropods and more moths — are endemic to the Lut, but are elusive in its heart, where the geckos were collected. The unexpected diversity highlights that there’s more living in this desert than meets the eye, Rajaei says.</p>



<p>The findings underscore the importance of intertwined food webs for animals to survive in hostile habitats, says Robert Pringle, an ecologist at Princeton University who was not involved in the research. “The movement of insects from outside the immediate area subsidizes the geckos and helps them to persist in this extreme desert environment,” he says.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/two-stars-cosmic-flare-light-fu-orionis">Two stars’ close encounter may explain a cosmic flare that has barely faded</a></h4>

              
                <p>A newborn star whizzing past another stellar youngster triggered a cosmic flare-up that began nearly a century ago and is still going strong today, researchers say.</p>



<p>In late 1936, a dim star in the constellation Orion started to erupt in our sky and soon shone over 100 times as brightly as it had before. Only telescopes could detect the star prior to the outburst, but afterward, the star was so bright it was visible through binoculars. The star even <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/funny-thing-happened-way-main-sequence">lit up part of the previously dark interstellar cloud called Barnard 35</a> that presumably gave the star birth (<em>SN:</em><em> 1/10/76</em>).</p>



<p>Amazingly, the star, now named FU Orionis, is still shining almost as brightly today, 85 years later. That means the star <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/number-milky-way-nova-explosions-per-year-pinned-down">wasn’t a nova</a>, a stellar explosion that quickly fades from view (<em>SN</em><em>: 2/12/21</em>). But the exact cause of the long-lasting flare-up has been a mystery.</p>



<p>Now, computer simulations may offer a clue to what’s kept the celestial beacon shining so brightly. Located about 1,330 light-years from Earth, FU Orionis is actually a double star, consisting of two separate stars that probably orbit each other. One is about as massive as the sun, while the other is only 30 percent to 60 percent as massive. Because the stars are so young, each has a disk of gas and dust revolving around it. It’s the lesser star’s passage through the other star’s disk that triggered and sustains the great flare-up, the simulations suggest.</p>





<p>“The low-mass star is the one that is in outburst,” says Elisabeth Borchert, an astrophysicist at Monash University in Clayton, Australia.</p>



<p>According to Borchert’s team, the outburst arose as the low-mass star passed 10 to 20 times as far from its mate as the Earth is from the sun — comparable to the distance between the sun and Saturn or Uranus. As the lesser star plowed through the other star’s disk, gas and dust from that disk rained down onto the intruder. In the simulations, this material got hot and glowed profusely, making the low-mass star hundreds of times brighter, behavior that mimicked FU Orionis’ outburst.</p>



<p>The flare-up has endured so long because the gravitational pull of the lesser star captured material that began to orbit the star <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.12723">and is still falling onto it</a>, the researchers explain in a paper submitted online November 24 at arXiv.org. The study will be published in <em>Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society</em>.</p>



<p>“It is a plausible explanation,” says Scott Kenyon, an astrophysicist at the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics in Cambridge, Mass., who was not involved with the study. The researchers “get a rise in luminosity about what the observations show,” he says, and “it lasts a long time.”</p>



<p>Kenyon says one way to test the team’s theory is to track how the two stars move relative to each other in the future. That may reveal whether the stars were as close together in 1936 as the simulations suggest. Astronomers <a href="https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1086/381705">discovered the binary nature of FU Orionis</a> only two decades ago, by which time the stars were much farther apart in their elliptical orbit around each other.</p>



<p>Since the discovery of FU Orionis, several other newborn stars have flared up in a similar fashion. The binary model “could be a good explanation for all of them,” Borchert says, if those stars also have stellar companions that recently skirted past.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coronavirus-covid-diabetes-fat-cells-blood-sugar">The coronavirus may cause fat cells to miscommunicate, leading to diabetes</a></h4>

              
                <p>Nola Sullivan recently marked an inauspicious anniversary. A little more than a year ago, on November 16, 2020, the 57-year-old pharmacy technician from Kellogg, Idaho, came down with COVID-19.</p>



<p>&#8220;I lost my taste and smell, with a very bad head cold, body aches, muscle spasm, fatigue, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea,” she says. It took a month for her muscle spasms and a lingering headache to go away. She missed nearly three months of work. Her senses of smell and taste still haven’t fully returned. And “I still have the fatigue. It’s horrible. I&#8217;m nauseous all the time.”</p>



<p>Sullivan has another lasting reminder of her battle with the coronavirus, too: diabetes.</p>



<p>When she finally returned to work at the pharmacy, “I noticed that I was so thirsty all the time. And I just thought that was part of the COVID,” she says. “I was drinking gallons of water.” As a pharmacy technician, though, she knew that excessive thirst can be sign of diabetes. So she decided to check her blood sugar. A person is considered diabetic when levels of glucose in their blood reach 200 milligrams of glucose per deciliter of blood. Sullivan’s was over 500.</p>





<aside class="wp-block-sciencenews-inline-related-post alignleft"><h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/sign-up-for-e-mail-updates-on-the-coronavirus-outbreak">Sign up for e-mail updates on the latest coronavirus news and research</a></h4></aside>



<p>Sullivan is not alone. In a study of more than 3,800 COVID-19 patients, <a href="https://www.cell.com/cell-metabolism/fulltext/S1550-4131(21)00428-9">just under half developed high blood sugar levels</a>, including many, like Sullivan, who were not previously diabetic, cardiologist James Lo and colleagues reported November 2 in <em>Cell Metabolism</em>. About 91 percent of the intubated COVID-19 patients had high blood sugar, as did almost 73 percent of people who died of the disease, the researchers reported.</p>



<p>Lo’s group, based at Weill Cornell Medicine in New York City, and others are now working to identify what’s causing high blood sugar in COVID-19 patients and what to do about it.</p>



<h4>Sugar spikes</h4>



<p>In March and April of 2020 — months before Sullivan caught COVID-19 — Columbia University Medical Center in New York City was full of COVID-19 patients. There, endocrinologist Utpal Pajvani noticed that “a lot of those people — but not a majority — were coming in with very high blood sugars. For some of those people, this was brand new for them.” &nbsp;</p>



<p>Lo too noticed that many of the COVID-19 patients in his hospital’s intensive care unit had high blood sugar. Preexisting diabetes is a risk factor for poor outcomes from COVID-19. But, like Sullivan, many of the patients Lo and his colleagues were seeing did not have diabetes before they got ill. People sometimes develop diabetes as they age, but Lo’s patients with high blood sugar were often “youngish, in their 30s and 40s,” he says. And levels of glucose in their blood were incredibly high, sometimes more than twice the level that indicates diabetes.</p>



<p>Such sky-high levels of blood sugar were associated with a 15 times higher risk of intubation and 3.6 times higher risk of death compared with people with the disease who had normal blood sugar levels, Lo and colleagues found.</p>

<h4>

</h4>
</aside>



<p>Notes Pajvani, “we don’t know if the high blood sugar is causal of the bad outcome or reflective of the bad outcome.” Still, he and other doctors aren’t totally surprised by the connection between COVID-19 and high blood sugar, or hyperglycemia.</p>



<p>High blood sugar has been documented in people with acute respiratory distress syndrome, or ARDS, caused by injuries or infections with other viruses or bacteria. ARDS is a condition in which the lungs can’t supply enough oxygen to the body.</p>



<p>COVID-19 patients with ARDS and high blood sugar spent three times longer in the hospital than people with ARDS caused by COVID-19 who have normal blood sugar levels, Lo and colleagues found. But weirdly people with hyperglycemia who had ARDS caused by COVID-19 were less likely to die than hyperglycemic people with ARDS due to other causes.</p>



<p>“The outlook was still bad, just not as bad in the group with ARDS and COVID, which is surprising,” says Ralph DeFronzo, an endocrinologist and chief of the diabetes division at the University of Texas Health Science Center at San Antonio, who was not involved with Lo’s study.</p>



<h4>Fingering a culprit</h4>



<p>Exactly what sends blood sugar soaring and causes diabetes in COVID-19 patients has been a mystery. Some evidence has hinted at the coronavirus infecting cells in the pancreas that make insulin, a hormone that lowers blood sugar levels by signaling cells to take in sugar and burn it for fuel. But in Lo’s study, COVID-19 patients with high blood sugar still made high levels of C-peptide, a naturally occurring bit of protein that links two chains of insulin and is made alongside insulin in pancreatic cells. High C-peptide levels indicate that the patients’ pancreatic cells were producing insulin.</p>



<p>These patients’ blood sugar was still high, though. So if the pancreatic cells weren’t the problem, something else must be going wrong.</p>



<p>That something else may be that fat cells infected with the coronavirus send the wrong message to other cells, ultimately leading to diabetes, Lo and colleagues suggest. Lo’s team discovered that COVID-19 patients had low levels of adiponectin, a hormone produced by fat cells that helps other cells heed insulin’s call to take in sugar. People with obesity also often make low levels of adiponectin, possibly explaining why they are <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coronavirus-covid19-obesity-risk-factor">at risk for poor outcomes from COVID-19</a> (<em>SN: 4/22/20</em>). Levels of several other hormones produced by fat cells were also out of whack, the researchers found.</p>

<p>The findings suggest that COVID-19 patients’ high blood sugar levels result from insulin resistance — a condition in which cells ignore insulin’s message to take in glucose — brought on by a dearth of fat hormones rather than by an inability to produce insulin.</p>



<p>The coronavirus can infect fat cells, the researchers’ experiments with hamsters and with cells grown in lab dishes showed. Damage done to fat cells directly by the virus, or indirectly by inflammation directed toward fighting the virus, may interfere with fat cells’ ability to make normal hormone levels and help maintain steady blood sugar levels.</p>



<p>Experiments by other researchers have also indicated that SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, can replicate in human fat, also known as adipose tissue, says Jose Aleman, an endocrinologist at the New York University Grossman School of Medicine. That’s yet another clue that fat is involved in severe disease.  </p>



<p>For instance, autopsies revealed that <a href="https://www.cell.com/cell-metabolism/fulltext/S1550-4131(21)00621-5">the coronavirus had infected fat cells</a> of 10 of 18 men who died of COVID-19, researchers in Germany report January 4 in <em>Cell Metabolism</em>. All 10 of the men with coronavirus in their fat were overweight or obese. The researchers also found SARS-CoV-2 in fats cells of 5 of 12 women who died of COVID-19, but those women were not all overweight or obese.</p>



<p>Inspired by Lo’s work, the German team uncovered evidence that coronavirus infection also affects fat cells’ ability to metabolize some lipids, leading people with COVID-19 to develop high levels of triglycerides in their blood. That’s yet another clue that fat isn’t working properly in some COVID patients. &nbsp;And these changes in fat may contribute to more severe COVID-19.</p>



<p></p>



<p>Obesity is often associated with inflammation in fat and other tissues. Coronavirus infection may make that inflammation worse, tipping the scales toward messed-up hormone production and eventual diabetes, Aleman says. Lo’s findings “lend credence to the idea that adipose is the reservoir for this low-grade inflammation that then gets triggered by COVID,” Aleman says.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But the conclusion is not a slam dunk, Pajvani says. “This is an example of very good research done in very difficult settings.” But because the study looked back a group of patients, but didn’t match their characteristics and limit other variables from the beginning, the work can’t definitively show the cause of COVID-related diabetes. “This gives us a great hint of the type of study to do,” he says.</p>

<h4>A lasting legacy</h4>



<p>Whether coronavirus infections cause diabetes or simply unmask the condition in susceptible people, such as people who are overweight or obese, is not yet clear, DeFronzo says. Aleman agrees. “A lot of these patients have an underlying state of insulin resistance, likely prediabetes, but then acute illness in the form of COVID-19 tips [them] over to diabetes.”</p>



<p>Doctors may be able to counteract high blood sugar by giving COVID-19 patients drugs called thiazolidinediones or glitazones that make cells more sensitive to insulin’s action. DeFronzo says he hopes to test one of those drugs called pioglitazone in COVID-19 patients with high blood sugar. The aim is to prevent the worst outcomes from COVID-19, but patients’ high blood sugar may linger.</p>



<p>For Sullivan, changing her diet and taking medication have helped her to control her blood sugar levels. “I’ve lost almost 60 pounds,” she says. &nbsp;But “they say that the diabetes will probably be for life.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://blog.arxiv.org/2022/01/03/two-million-articles-and-counting/">Two million articles and counting!</a></h4>

              
                <p><a href="https://news.cornell.edu/stories/2022/01/arxiv-hits-2m-submissions"><em>(A version of this article also appears in the Cornell Chronicle)</em></a></p>
<p><a href="https://arxiv.org/">arXiv.org</a> now hosts more than 2 million articles.</p>
<p>arXiv, stewarded by Cornell Tech, is a free resource for scholars around the world in fields including physics, math and computer science, who use the service to share their own cutting-edge research and read work submitted by others.</p>
<p>“These 2 million submissions represent 2 million opportunities for humanity to push forward the frontiers of our understanding,” said Tara Holm, professor of mathematics in the College of Arts and Sciences and arXiv advisory board member. “As we celebrate this achievement, we must also continue the drive to make our disciplines and our research more accessible to researchers and the public around the world.”</p>
<p>Founded three decades ago, arXiv pioneered the open access movement, providing a fast, free, digital service to share research results. This value became critically apparent in 2020 as the pandemic made the speed of research a matter of life and death. arXiv now hosts more than 5,400 submissions related to COVID-19.</p>
<p>Today, up to 1,200 new submissions in eight major subject areas are received daily, in addition to as many as 1,000 revisions and other updates. Four staff members, 196 volunteer moderators around the world, and automated systems screen and curate the submissions, which are not peer reviewed.</p>
<p>The research, ranging from mathematical models of COVID spread to planetary astrophysics to machine learning, is submitted by graduate students and Nobel Prize winners alike.</p>
<p>“If I ask the question, ‘Are all or most of your papers on arXiv?’ to a mathematician in my field, they would look at me in disbelief and say, ‘Of course all of my papers are on arXiv.’” Holm said. “arXiv has transformed mathematics. It makes current research available to students and researchers across the globe. arXiv has become the lifeblood of mathematics research.”</p>
<p>arXiv founder Paul Ginsparg, professor of physics (A&amp;S) and information science (Cornell Ann S. Bowers College of Computing and Information Science), credits much of arXiv’s success to the no-frills design of the website, and notes that the service has served as a model for others, such as bioRxiv, operated by Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory.</p>
<p>“It’s always gratifying to hear from a new generation of researchers that arXiv continues to have a profound effect on their daily research activities,” Ginsparg said. “And in turn they like to hear about my graduate student days, when we used to write our physics articles using feather quills on scrolls of parchment. It took 23-and-a-half years to get 1 million submissions, seven more years to get to 2 million submissions, and perhaps will be another four and a half years to get to 3 million.”</p>
<p>arXiv is supported by its global research community. Major funding is supplied by the Simons Foundation, in addition to contributions from donors and 243 libraries, universities, research organizations and professional societies.</p>
<p>“Researchers on the arXiv advisory board are its stewards and we owe it to our colleagues, friends and those we have yet to meet to sustain it and ensure its future,” said Holm. “The research community must fiercely advocate for the support of arXiv.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2022/01/open-access-doesnt-need-apcs-part-1/">Open Access Doesn’t Need APCs Part 1: Charting a new course with Community Action Publishing</a></h4>

              
                <p><em>Welcome to a new year and our new series exploring our APC-alternative models from <em>Sara Rouhi,</em> Director of Strategic Partnerships at PLOS</em>.</p>



<p>Open Access has always been at the heart of PLOS, beginning with <em>PLOS Biology</em> and <em>PLOS Medicine</em> which notably helped change the publishing landscape more than 15 years ago. These journals broke boundaries at the time by making some of the most exceptional work in the field openly available to all readers without restrictions. They, and other early OA journals, helped pioneer the Article Processing Charge (APC) model. But as the demand for Open Access solutions has grown, it&rsquo;s become obvious that APCs alone cannot equitably fulfill the needs of all authors and readers. Which is why we set out to find a new solution that would make highly-selective Open Access publishing more sustainable while making publication <em>free</em> for authors.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The answer we developed was <a href="https://plos.org/publish/community-action-publishing-for-authors/">Community Action Publishing</a> (CAP).&nbsp;</p>



<p></p>



<p><strong>What makes Community Action Publishing unique?</strong></p>



<p>So many things! At its core, Community Action Publishing functions similarly to a co-op. Institutional members of each journal community share an equitable portion of the journal&rsquo;s total publishing costs, based on the publication activity of their authors. Those authors therefore have unlimited opportunities to publish in <em>PLOS Medicine</em>, <em>PLOS Biology</em> or our new journal, <em>PLOS Sustainability and Transformation</em> for free, giving authors more freedom to choose where to submit their work based on what&rsquo;s best for their research and their readers&ndash;not their budget.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Before we get into exactly how CAP works we want to acknowledge that the model is currently also supported by non-member fees for publications, only when the authors&rsquo; institutions are not members. However, our ultimate goal is to make these journals open to read and open to publish. How? We are actively reaching out to institutions to encourage them to join CAP. Authors can help by filling out this <a href="https://plos.org/resources/refer/">form</a>, or contacting their institutional librarian directly to let them know that they want their support.&nbsp;</p>



<p></p>



<p><strong>Community Action Publishing is not based on APCs, it&rsquo;s based on community</strong></p>



<p>This is not just a partnership deal to streamline institutional support for APCs. CAP is a new way of thinking about Open Access publishing in terms of total journal costs spread over as many stakeholders as possible, rather than individual article fees paid by a smaller author community. It&rsquo;s ideal for selective journals that serve as a platform for specific research communities and which incur higher costs by the nature of their services. This allows us to re-examine how we distribute costs more fairly based on researcher activity. The model also automatically includes institutions in Research 4 Life countries as members so that researchers in these regions can also publish for free.&nbsp;</p>



<p></p>



<p><strong>Most importantly, Community Action Publishing is built on transparency, openness and collaboration.</strong>&nbsp;</p>



<p>CAP moves Open Access beyond the APC to ensure the sustainability of highly-selective Open Access publishing for all of its stakeholders. We worked with both library and researcher communities to develop this model and we continue to seek their advice and share information as our pilot progresses.&nbsp;</p>



<p>From the beginning, we have made our total cost recovery targets for each journal transparent on our website, and our partners get a detailed breakdown of their authors&rsquo; publishing activity and pricing tier before they decide to work with us. We&rsquo;ve committed to capping our margins at 10% which will be used to reinvest in programs that support our mission and provide value to the research community. Because the pie isn&rsquo;t getting any larger, the more institutional partners who join in to support the journal community, the lower costs become for everyone.&nbsp;</p>



<p></p>



<p>We are continually experimenting to find new solutions that fulfill the needs of our distinct research communities. Each of our journals now offers APC-alternatives tailored to the publishing activity in that community. Keep a look out for future posts in this series with more about our Flat Fees and Global Equity models.&nbsp;</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/arctic-hunter-gatherers-iron-metal-production-sweden">Arctic hunter-gatherers were advanced ironworkers more than 2,000 years ago</a></h4>

              
                <p>Hunter-gatherers who lived more than 2,000 years ago near the top of the world appear to have run ironworking operations as advanced as those of farming societies far to the south.</p>



<p>Excavations in what’s now northeastern Sweden uncovered ancient furnaces and fire pits that hunter-gatherers used for metalworking. A mobile lifestyle did not prevent hardy groups based in or near the Arctic Circle from organizing large-scale efforts to produce iron and craft metal objects, say archaeologist Carina Bennerhag of Luleå University of Technology in Sweden and colleagues. In fact, hunter-gatherers who moved for part of the year across cold, forested regions dotted with lakes and swampy patches <a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/antiquity/article/huntergatherer-metallurgy-in-the-early-iron-age-of-northern-fennoscandia/0BD3D4FF8DF8A6A65F74526242A98C66">apparently exchanged resources and knowledge related to metallurgy</a>, the extraction of metals from ores, the researchers report in the December <em>Antiquity</em>.</p>



<p>Ancient hunter-gatherers at two Swedish sites “probably manufactured more iron and steel, and were more socially organized and sedentary than we previously thought,” says Luleå archaeologist and coauthor Kristina Söderholm.</p>



<p>Groups must have settled down for substantial amounts of time at locations near crucial resources, such as ores for prospecting, wood needed to make charcoal and clay and stone required for building furnaces and fire pits used in iron production, the scientists say.</p>





<p>Many investigators <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/space-beads-push-back-origins-iron-working">regard ironworking as an invention of large agricultural societies</a> in southwest Asia more than 3,000 years ago (<em>SN: 8/22/13</em>). From there, this technology has typically been thought to have spread elsewhere, eventually being adopted in simplified forms by people in northern Scandinavia and other Arctic areas between A.D. 700 and 1600.</p>



<p>But that view has been questioned in recent years. Increasing evidence indicates that ancient technologies, including metallurgy, were mastered relatively early by small-scale societies, says archaeological scientist Marcos Martinón-Torres of the University of Cambridge, who was not part of Bennerhag’s team.</p>



<p>“This study is particularly insightful because the metal is iron, typically considered a more challenging metallurgy than copper or gold; the makers are hunter-gatherers, historically assumed to use only basic technologies; and the location is in a region largely ignored in histories of technology,” he says.</p>



<p>Bennerhag first directed excavations at a site called Sangis. Investigators uncovered a rectangular iron-smelting furnace consisting of a frame of stone slabs with one open side. A clay shaft was built within and partly on the frame. Holes in the frame served as inlets for air blown on burning charcoal inside, probably by bellows placed on flat stones, the researchers say.</p>



<p>By-products of heating iron ore at high temperatures and remnants of a ceramic wall lining were found inside the furnace. Radiocarbon dating of furnace remains indicate that iron production occurred between around 200 and 50 B.C.</p>



<p>Areas that hunter-gatherers occupied about 500 meters from the furnace contained pottery fragments and other material dating to between around 500 B.C. and A.D. 900. Finds include numerous fish bones and at least three fire pits where iron from the furnace was reheated and refined. There, researchers found several iron items and others made of steel, a bronze buckle and metallic waste with copper droplets on the surface, suggesting that different metals were produced at Sangis.</p>



<p>The bronze buckle’s molding technique and decorative style resemble metal items found at hunter-gatherer sites in northwestern Russia dating to as early as around 2,300 years ago, the researchers say. Knives and other metal objects found at Sangis contained two or more layers that had been expertly welded together and, in some cases, exposed to either of two types of heating processes to enhance their strength.</p>



<p>Excavations at a second site, Vivungi, uncovered the remains of two iron-smelting furnaces that contained iron ore, by-products of iron production and shards of ceramic wall lining. Iron production at Vivungi started around 100 B.C., the scientists say. Vivungi yielded no evidence of fire pits where iron was further purified.</p>



<p>Radiocarbon dating of animal bones found near the Vivungi furnaces indicates that hunter-gatherers repeatedly occupied this location from around 5300 B.C. to A.D. 1600.</p>



<p>Evidence of iron production in southern Scandinavia more than 2,000 years ago already existed. So discoveries of similarly old ironwork farther north make sense, says archaeometallurgist Thilo Rehren of the Cyprus Institute in Nicosia, who did not participate in the new study. Preliminary work indicates that iron production also began in East Asia more than 2,000 years ago, Rehren adds.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/africa-great-green-wall-trees-sahel-climate-change">Africa’s ‘Great Green Wall’ could have far-reaching climate effects</a></h4>

              
                <p>Africa’s “Great Green Wall” initiative is a proposed 8,000-kilometer line of trees meant to hold back the Sahara from expanding southward. New climate simulations looking to both the region’s past and future suggest this greening <a href="https://agu.confex.com/agu/fm21/meetingapp.cgi/Paper/805754">could have a profound effect on the climate of northern Africa</a>, and even beyond.</p>



<p>By 2030, the project aims to plant 100 million hectares of trees along the Sahel, the semiarid zone lining the desert’s southern edge. That completed tree line could as much as double rainfall within the Sahel and would also decrease average summer temperatures throughout much of northern Africa and into the Mediterranean, according to the simulations, presented December 14 during the American Geophysical Union’s fall meeting. But, the study found, temperatures in the hottest parts of the desert would become even hotter.</p>



<p>Previous studies have shown that a “green Sahara” is linked to changes in the intensity and location of the West African monsoon. That major wind system blows hot, dry air southwestward across northern Africa during the cooler months and brings slightly wetter conditions northeastward during the hotter months.</p>



<p>Such changes in the monsoon’s intensity as well as its northward or southward extent <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/monsoon-deluges-turned-ancient-sahara-green">led to a green Sahara</a> period that lasted from about 11,000 to 5,000 years ago, for example (<em>SN: 1/18/17</em>). Some of the strongest early evidence for that greener Sahara of the past came in the 1930s, when Hungarian explorer László Almásy — the basis for the protagonist of the 1996 movie <em>The English Patient</em> — discovered Neolithic cave and rock art in the Libyan Desert that depicted people swimming.</p>





<p>Past changes in the West African monsoon are linked to cyclical variations in Earth’s orbit, which alters how much incoming solar radiation heats up the region. But orbital cycles don’t tell the whole story, says Francesco Pausata, a climate dynamicist at the Université du Québec à Montréal who ran the new simulations. Scientists now recognize that changes in plant cover and overall dustiness can dramatically intensify those monsoon shifts, he says.</p>



<p>More vegetation “helps create a local pool of moisture,” with more water cycling from soil to atmosphere, <a href="https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1029/2020GL088728">increasing humidity and therefore rainfall</a>, says Deepak Chandan, a paleoclimatologist at the University of Toronto who was not involved in the work. Plants also make for a darker land surface compared with blinding desert sands, so that the ground absorbs more heat, Chandan says. What’s more, vegetation reduces how much dust is in the atmosphere. Dust particles can reflect sunlight back to space, so less dust means more solar radiation can reach the land. Add it all up, and <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.oneear.2020.03.002">these effects lead to more heat and more humidity over the land</a> relative to the ocean, creating a larger difference in atmospheric pressure. And that means stronger, more intense monsoon winds will blow.</p>



<p>The idea for Africa’s Great Green Wall came in the 1970s and ’80s, when the once-fertile Sahel began to turn barren and dry as a result of changing climate and land use. Planting a protective wall of vegetation to hold back an expanding desert is a long-standing scheme. In the 1930s, President Franklin Roosevelt mobilized the U.S. Forest Service and the Works Progress Administration to plant walls of trees from the Great Plains to Texas to slow the growth of the Dust Bowl. Since the 1970s, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/planting-trees-climate-change-carbon-capture-deforestation">China has engaged in its own massive desert vegetation project</a> — also nicknamed the Great Green Wall — in an attempt to halt the southward march of sand dunes from the Gobi Desert (<em>SN: 7/9/21</em>).</p>



<p>Led by the African Union, Africa’s <a href="https://www.unccd.int/actions/great-green-wall-initiative">Great Green Wall project</a> launched in 2007 and is now roughly 15 percent complete. Proponents hope the completed tree line, which will extend from Senegal to Djibouti, will not only hold back the desert from expanding southward, but also bring improved food security and millions of jobs to the region.</p>



<p>What effect the finished greening might ultimately have on the local, regional and global climate has been little studied — and it needs to be, Pausata says. The initiative is, essentially, a geoengineering project, he says, and when people want to do any type of geoengineering, they should study these possible impacts.</p>



<p>To investigate those possible impacts, Pausata created high-resolution computer simulations of future global warming, both with and without a simulated wall of plants along the Sahel. Against the backdrop of global warming, the Great Green Wall would decrease average summertime temperatures in most of the Sahel by as much as 1.5 degrees Celsius.</p>



<p>But the Sahel’s hottest areas would get even hotter, with average temperatures increasing by as much as 1.5 degrees C. The greening would also increase rainfall across the entire region, even doubling it in some places, the research suggests.</p>



<p>These results are preliminary, Pausata says, and the data presented at the meeting were only for a <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/why-climate-change-models-disagree-earth-worst-case-scenarios">high-emissions future warming scenario</a> called RCP8.5 that may not end up matching reality (<em>SN: 1/7/20</em>). Simulations for moderate- and lower-emissions scenarios are ongoing.</p>



<p>The effects of greening the Sahara might extend far beyond the region, the simulations suggest. A stronger West African monsoon could shift larger atmospheric circulation patterns westward, influencing other climate patterns such as the El Niño Southern Oscillation and altering the tracks of tropical cyclones.</p>



<p>Chandan agrees that it’s important to understand just what impact such large-scale planting might have and notes that improvements in understanding what led to past changes in the Sahara are key to simulating its future. That the Great Green Wall’s impact could be far-ranging also makes sense, he says: “The climate system is full of interactions.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/enceladus-plumes-water-ocean-saturn">Enceladus’ plumes might not come from an underground ocean</a></h4>

              
                <p>Saturn’s icy moon Enceladus sprays water vapor into space. Scientists have thought that the plumes come from a deep subsurface ocean — but that might not be the case, new simulations suggest.</p>



<p>Instead, the water could come from pockets of watery mush in the moon’s icy shell, scientists report December 15 at the American Geophysical Union’s fall meeting.</p>



<p>“Maybe we didn’t get the straw all the way through the ice shell to the ocean. Maybe we’re just getting this weird pocket,” says planetary scientist Jacob Buffo of Dartmouth College.</p>



<p>The finding is “a cautionary tale,” Buffo says. The hidden ocean makes Enceladus one of the best places to <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/alien-oceans-book-search-extraterrestrial-life-outer-solar-system">search for life in the solar system</a> (<em>SN: 4/8/20</em>). Concepts for future missions to Enceladus rely on the idea that taking samples of the plumes would directly test the contents of the ocean, without needing to drill or melt through the ice. “That could be true,” Buffo says. But the simulations suggest “you could be sampling this slushy region in the middle of the shell, and that might not be the same chemistry as is down in the ocean.”</p>





<p>Enceladus has beguiled planetary scientists since NASA’s Cassini spacecraft revealed the moon’s <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/enceladus-small-feisty">dramatic plumes in 2005</a> (<em>SN: 8/23/05</em>). At the time, researchers wondered if the spray originated on Enceladus’ icy surface, where friction from quakes could melt ice and let it escape as pure water vapor into space. But later evidence collected by Cassini convinced most scientists that the geysers are from fractures in the shell that reach all the way to a <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/saturn-moons-geysers-draw-water-subsurface-sea">salty, subsurface sea</a> (<em>SN: 8/4/14</em>).</p>



<p>One of the most convincing pieces of evidence was the fact that the plumes contain salts, said physicist Colin Meyer of Dartmouth in a talk at the meeting, which was held virtually and in New Orleans. Early versions of the quake idea couldn’t account for those salts, and instead suggested that any salts in the melted ice would be left on the surface as the water escaped into space, like the sheen of salt left on your skin after you sweat, he says.</p>



<p>But Meyer, who has studied the physics of sea ice on Earth, realized that pockets of meltwater in the ice shell could concentrate salts and other compounds. He, Buffo and colleagues applied computer simulations developed for sea ice on Earth to the observed icy conditions on Enceladus. The team found that Enceladus could easily generate pockets of mush within its shell and vent the contents of that mush out into space, salts and all.</p>



<p>That does not mean Enceladus doesn’t have an ocean, Meyer says — it almost certainly does. And it does not mean the ocean isn’t habitable, Buffo adds.</p>



<p>The implications of the results “are huge,” especially for proposed life-finding missions to Enceladus, says planetary scientist Emily Martin of the Smithsonian National Air and Space Museum in Washington, D.C., who was not involved in the work.</p>



<p>“If those plumes aren’t tapping into the ocean, it will really shift our perspective on what that plume is telling us about the interior of Enceladus,” Martin says. “And that’s a big deal.”</p>

Pourghebleh, of the Young Researchers and Elite Club at the Urmia branch of Islamic Azad University in Iran, noticed a paper published on December 15, 2020 in an IEEE journal that overlapped 80 percent with an article he’d co-authored the year before.

I was severely depressed. I could not see  myself continuing if this was all I’d be able to do, if I could never  move beyond this.

In the present case, her most recent 4-year episode did not adequately respond to four antidepressants, augmentation with five other meds, electroconvulsive therapy, transcranial magnetic stimulation, or psychotherapy.

              <h4><a href="https://xcorr.net/2021/12/31/2021-in-review-unsupervised-brain-models/">2021 in review: unsupervised brain models</a></h4>

              
                <p>We&#8217;re in a golden age of merging AI and neuroscience. No longer tied to conventional publication venues with year-long turnaround times, our field is moving at record speed. As 2021 draws to a close, I wanted to take some time to zoom out and review a recent trend in neuro-AI, the move toward unsupervised learning to explain representations in different brain areas<sup>footnote</sup>. </p>



<h2 id="supervision-be-gone">Supervision be gone</h2>



<p>One of the most robust findings in neuro-AI is that artificial neural networks trained to perform ecologically relevant tasks match single neurons and ensemble signals in the brain. The canonical example is the ventral stream, where <a href="https://openreview.net/forum?id=i_xiyGq6FNT">DNNs trained for object recognition on ImageNet match representations in IT</a> (Khaligh-Razavi &amp; Kriegeskorte, 2014, Yamins et al. 2014). Supervised, task-optimized networks link two important forms of explanation: ecological relevance and accounting for neural activity. They answer the teleological question: what is a brain region for? </p>



<p>However, as Jess Thompson points out, these are far from the only forms of explanation. In particular, task-optimized networks are generally not considered biologically plausible. Conventional ImageNet training uses 1M images. For a human infant to get this level of supervision, they would have to receive a new supervised label every 5 seconds (e.g. the parent points at a duck and says &#8220;duck&#8221;) for 3 hours a day, for more than a year. And for a non-human primate or a mouse? Thus, the search for biologically plausible networks which match the human brain is still on.</p>

<p>This year, we&#8217;ve seen a lot of headway into finding ways around supervision, and alternatives to supervised training are now competitive.</p>



<h2 id="unsupervised-self-supervised-contrastive-multimodal">Unsupervised, self-supervised, contrastive, multimodal</h2>



<p>The alternatives to supervised training are many, and it&#8217;s not clear which method is <em>winning</em> right now. Let&#8217;s review the methods:</p>

<ul><li>Unsupervised learning aims to represent the data distribution. I&#8217;ve covered some <a href="https://xcorr.net/2021/07/26/dimensionality-reduction-in-neural-data-analysis/">unsupervised techniques</a> in the context of dimensionality reduction in neuroscience. One of the most often used techniques in this space the variational autoencoder (VAE).</li><li><a href="https://lilianweng.github.io/lil-log/2019/11/10/self-supervised-learning.html">Self-supervised training</a> aims to find good data representations by solving pretext tasks (figure above). Many have been proposed over the years. Language models are almost universally trained with self-supervision these days; think BERT and GPT-3.</li><li><a href="https://lilianweng.github.io/lil-log/2021/05/31/contrastive-representation-learning.html">Contrastive learning is a particular flavor</a> of self-supervised learning where the pretext task is to predict whether a sample is from a positive or negative (or distractor) class (hence &#8220;contrast&#8221;). There are many different flavors of contrastive learning: MoCo, InfoNCE, SimCLR, CPC, etc. There are also closely related non-contrastive methods that do away with negative samples, including BYOL and BarlowTwins.</li><li>Multimodal learning is a particular flavor of self-supervised training which aims to find a common subspace for two different modalities (e.g. vision, text, audio, etc.) by predicting one from the other, or predicting a common subspace. CLIP is perhaps the most famous multimodal network &#8211; <a href="https://openai.com/blog/clip/">it&#8217;s trained contrastively</a>. </li></ul>



<p>All of these methods allow us to learn a representation without the need for pesky supervision. If it turns out that this representation is aligned to a brain area, this is a win, as self-supervised and unsupervised methods are more biologically plausible than supervised methods. </p>



<h2 id="papers">Papers</h2>



<p>I went through and reviewed this year&#8217;s MAIN conference, NeurIPS, CCN, as well as whatever papers and preprints happened to show in my Twitter feed. Of course, this review reflects my research interests (heavily skewed towards a certain flavor of neuro-AI and vision), but I hope it&#8217;s useful to many of you who want to see where the field is going.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.pnas.org/content/118/3/e2014196118">Zhuang and colleagues (2021)</a>. This paper was just published in PNAS this year and already has &gt; 60 citations. They found that unsupervised and self-supervised methods learned representations that are well-aligned to ventral stream (V1, V4, IT) neurons. Their significance statement:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>Primates show remarkable ability to recognize objects. This ability is achieved by their ventral visual stream, multiple hierarchically interconnected brain areas. The best quantitative models of these areas are deep neural networks trained with human annotations. However, they receive more annotations than infants, making them implausible models of the ventral stream development. Here, we report that recent progress in unsupervised learning has largely closed this gap. We find the networks learned with recent unsupervised methods achieve prediction accuracy in the ventral stream that equals or exceeds that of today’s best models. These results illustrate a use of unsupervised learning to model a brain system and present a strong candidate for a biologically plausible computational theory of sensory learning.</p></blockquote>



<p>In particular, they found that SimCLR and other contrastive learning methods could explain ventral stream neurons almost as well as supervised methods. Very strong proof-of-concept that labels are not necessary; major milestone for the field IMO.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.06.15.153247v3">Konkle and Alvarez (2021), bioRxiv</a>. This paper asked a similar question to the Zhuang et al. paper: can the ventral stream be accounted by a network trained without supervised learning? They used fMRI in humans rather than single neuron recordings to evaluate this. They find results which are broadly compatible with the Zhuang paper, with their own flavor of instance-contrastive self-supervision, as well as other along the same lines (SimCLR) accounting for the fMRI data. Interestingly, they find a disconnect between ImageNet classification accuracy and match to fMRI data. This paper has a really interesting discussion, where they seriously consider how you would actually implement self-supervision in a brain. They identify retinal distortions, saccades (<a href="https://openreview.net/forum?id=Yu8Q6341U7W">see also this recent NeurIPS paper</a>), efference copy, as well as a hippocampus-based buffering mechanism as means of instantiating self-supervision. I would love to see a modelling study instantiating these ideas &#8211; I&#8217;m sure they&#8217;re already on it!</p>



<h3 id="your-head-is-there-to-move-you-around-goal-driven-models-of-the-primate-dorsal-pathway">Your head is there to move you around:<br>Goal-driven models of the primate dorsal pathway</h3>



<p><a href="https://your-head-is-there-to-move-you-around.netlify.app/">Mineault et al. (2021)</a>. Super excited we got this accepted as a spotlight in NeurIPS this year. As I&#8217;ve discussed previously, ventral stream neurons are selective for shape. However, there&#8217;s an entirely separate stream, the dorsal stream, which is highly sensitive to motion. How does that work? I compared a number of supervised 3d (spacetime) networks to different dorsal stream areas and found that they could not account for the responses of single neurons in non-human primates. Taking the task-driven paradigm at face value, we asked: what kind of task would create the kinds of representations we see in the dorsal stream? I rigged up a pretext task in which an agent moving about in the world must determine the parameters of its self-motion from the patterns of images falling on its retina. This was super fun to program in Airsim, which is an Unreal-based simulation engine for drones. </p>

<p>The resulting network looked a lot like the dorsal stream, and this was true both qualitatively and quantitatively. Now, the training of this model is supervised, but from the agent&#8217;s perspective it&#8217;s self-supervised, multimodal learning: the agent learns to predict the parameters of its self-motion (vestibular, efference copy) from another modality (vision). That&#8217;s potentially biologically plausible (NHP experiments to follow). </p>

<p><a href="https://ventral-dorsal-model.netlify.app/">Bakhtiari et al. (2021)</a>. Very happy that we got not one but two spotlights in NeurIPS this year,  Shahab really knocked it out of the park with this one! Mammals have both dorsal- and ventral-like streams, whether it&#8217;s humans, non-human primates or mice. Can one artificial neural network explain both? Shahab used a contrastive predictive coding (CPC) network trained on movie clips and found that, with two separate parallel pathways, the network self-organized into a dorsal and a ventral stream. The dorsal stream pathway provided a nice match to mice dorsal areas, and the ventral stream was well matched to ventral stream. What&#8217;s more, networks trained with supervision, or networks with just one pathway did not match the brain of mice. I think it&#8217;s a very nice embodiment of the idea that with anatomical priors and a sprinkling of self-supervision, the brain can bootstrap itself into existence. </p>

<p><a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.06.16.448730v2">Nayebi et al. (2021), bioRxiv</a>. Deep neural nets are great models of primate visual cortex, but not so much for mice. This paper asks the question of how we can obtain better models of mouse vision using more ethologically relevant, more anatomically grounded models. They used mouse visual cortex data (static images) and compared it to supervised and self-supervised networks of different architectures. One interesting finding is that shallow networks with parallel branches explain mice data better. This corroborates Shahab&#8217;s findings. They make the argument that mice&#8217;s visual brain is a shallow “general purpose” visual machine, which is good for a variety of tasks, unlike the deep neural network in our brains, which is highly specialized to subtasks. I think these ideas fit very nicely with the idea that different brains are adapted to different ecological niches, which is one of my favorite theories of everything in neuroscience. </p>

Another paper on self-supervised learning in mouse visual cortex. This one is notable for the breadth of metrics and models considered: vision transformers, MLP mixers, taskonomy encoders, self-supervised models. Broadly speaking, the results are compatible with the previous two papers. I think the most notable finding is that some ethologically relevant taskonomy tasks stood out as better aligned to the brain: 2d segmentation, object recognition and semantic segmentation. Perhaps the mouse&#8217;s visual brain receives some multi-modal self-supervision from the whiskers?! It&#8217;s a very cool idea that an experimentalist should pick up.</p>

<p><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.07411">Geirhos et al. (2021), NeurIPS</a>. Humans are very good at performing classification of images under distortions, such as noise, changes in contrast, rotations, etc. Up to now, CNNs have performed poorly on this task. In this paper, they ask the question of whether newer models have closed this gap. Indeed, they have! They find that newfangled self-supervised and multimodal models are now at par with humans when it comes to robustness to distortions. One important factor underlying the results is how much data the network was trained on: models trained with orders of magnitude more data are more robust. CLIP performs exceptionally well here, for reasons that are still not clear. Newer models are also less sensitive to texture and more to shape: they seem to be taking less shortcuts. Nevertheless, newer models still make distinctly non-human mistakes, which they were able to show with extensive psychophysics. Very thorough evaluation, <a href="https://openreview.net/forum?id=QkljT4mrfs">the reviewers loved it</a> and so did I.</p>

<p><a href="https://openreview.net/forum?id=6dymbuga7nL">Choksi et al. (2021), SVHRM workshop</a>. The hippocampus contains &#8220;concept cells&#8221; (e.g. the infamous Jennifer Aniston cell) that are highly multimodal; they will respond to a textual representation of a concept or an image. Interestingly, CLIP does the same, and in fact can be fooled by adversarial labels (i.e. writing wrong labels into an image). In this workshop paper, the authors use publicly available fMRI data to show that multimodal networks, including CLIP, explain hippocampal data best. It&#8217;s wild that there&#8217;s something so special about CLIP, and we still don&#8217;t know what it means! </p>

<p><a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-021-26751-5">Higgins et al. (2021)</a>, Nature Comms. The Deepmind gang is at it again comparing neural representations in face selective areas and unsupervised, disentangled neural networks. They ask whether single, face-selective neurons in IT are aligned to single disentangled causal factors. Perhaps a single neuron in IT encodes a single causal factor which affects the appearance of faces, e.g. skin tone, lighting, age, etc. The manifold perspective of neural representation, OTOH, is that neurons don&#8217;t have to be axis-aligned to represent interesting factors; arbitrary rotations of the latent factors are just as good candidates for representation. This would argue against axis-alignment.</p>



<p>They trained an unsupervised neural network, the beta-VAE, to represent faces. <a href="https://lilianweng.github.io/lil-log/2018/08/12/from-autoencoder-to-beta-vae.html#vae-variational-autoencoder">A beta-VAE is a variational auto-encoder (VAE) </a>with a higher weight (=beta) on the KL term, which encourages the representation to be disentangled. They show in this case that <em>single neurons</em> in IT are aligned to <em>single</em> disentangled latent factors in the VAE, which argues against the manifold view and for the disentangled causal graph view. Like all good papers, asks more questions than it answer: how does disentangling happen in the brain? How do people learn disentangling? What&#8217;s the advantage of a disentangled representation?</p>

<p><a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41562-021-01097-6">Storrs et al. (2021), Nature Human Behaviour</a>. This paper examines the question of how humans perceive gloss from surfaces. They train a pixel-VAE on an ensemble of textures and examine how the latent factors are aligned to how humans perceive surfaces. They find that the VAE naturally disentangles different factors, and furthermore, is well aligned to human perception! Furthermore, they find that supervised networks don&#8217;t perform nearly as well on this task. Very cool idea, and lots of nice psychophysics in this paper.</p>



<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>



<p>This year has seen huge advances in matching unsupervised and self-supervised models to brains. They offer a number of advantages over the alternatives: potentially a better match to brain data, they can trained without labels.</p>



<p>We have to be careful though: learning without labels is better than with labels, but we still have to run through the numbers to see if the math works out. In particular, because labels are expensive, and self-supervision opens the door for learning without labels, the latest class of models often uses a tremendous amount of data for training. For instance, GPT-3 is trained on essentially all the text that&#8217;s ever been produced by humanity (~500 billion tokens). By contrast, children in the most talkative homes are exposed to ~30M words by the time they&#8217;re five. If we find an alignment between GPT-3 and representations of language in the human brain, it doesn&#8217;t follow that contrastive training on an immense corpus as in GPT-3 is a biologically plausible mechanism for language acquisition and representation; we&#8217;re still off by 4 orders of magnitude. </p>



<p>2022 will hopefully see a lot of work on ethologically-grounded learning. This, mixed with biologically plausible self-supervised and unsupervised learning, will lead to more refined models of how the brain can learn good representations during evolution and development.</p>

<p>During the last year, I have continued to work on the ideas described during previous year-end write-ups, resulting in a project proposal that is currently under evaluation. I will use this year’s write-up to talk about something different, although related, a recent book by Peter Robin Hiesinger: <em><a href="http://selfassemblingbrain.com/">The Self-Assembling Brain</a></em>.</p>



<p>Hiesinger, based in Berlin, is working in the field of developmental neurobiology. However, this book is rather a cross-over between multiple disciplines, ranging from developmental neurobiology, circuit neuroscience, artificial intelligence, robotics, and many side-branches of the mentioned disciplines. Hiesinger masterfully assembles the perspectives of the different fields around his own points of interest. For example, his introductory discussion about the emergence of the field of artificial intelligence in the 1950s is one of the most insightful account that I have read about this period. He tells the stories how key figures like von Neumann, Minsky, Rosenblatt or McCarthy and their relationships and personalities influenced the further development of the field.</p>



<p>The main hypothesis of Hiesinger&#8217;s book is that the genetic code does not encode the <em>endpoint </em>of the system (e.g., the map of brain areas, the default state network, thalamocortical loops, interneuron connectivity, etc.). According to him, and I think that most neuroscientists would agree, the neuronal circuits of the brain are not directly encoded in the genetic code. Instead, the simple genetic code needs to <em>unfold </em>in time in order to generate the complex brain. More importantly, it is, according to Hiesinger, necessary to actually <em>run </em>the code in order to find out what the endpoint of the system is. Let&#8217;s pick two analogies brought up in the book to illustrate this <em>unfolding </em>idea.</p>



<p>First, in the preface Hiesinger describes how an alien not familiar with life on earth finds an apple seed. Upon analysis of the apple seed, the alien realizes that there are complex and intricate genetic codes in the apple seed, and it starts to see beauty and meaning in these patterns. However, the analysis based on its structural content would not enable the alien to predict the purpose of the apple seed. This is only possible by development (unfolding) of the seed into an apple tree. Unfolding therefore is the addition of both time and energy to the seed.</p>



<p>Second, Hiesinger connects the <em>unfolding </em>idea with the field of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cellular_automaton">cellular automata</a>, and in particular with the early work of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_Wolfram">Stephen Wolfram</a>, a very influential but also controversial personality of complexity research, and his cellular automaton named rule 110. The 110 automaton is a very simple rule (the rule is described in this <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rule_110#Definition">wikipedia article</a>) that is applied to a row of 1&#8217;s and 0&#8217;s and results in another binary row. The resulting row is again subject to rule 110, etc., leading to a two-dimensional pattern as computed here in Matlab:</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img data-attachment-id="7012" data-permalink="https://gcamp6f.com/rule110_2-1/" data-orig-file="https://ptrrupprecht.files.wordpress.com/2021/12/rule110_2-1.png" data-orig-size="499,421" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="rule110_2-1" data-image-description="" data-image-caption="" data-medium-file="https://ptrrupprecht.files.wordpress.com/2021/12/rule110_2-1.png?w=300" data-large-file="https://ptrrupprecht.files.wordpress.com/2021/12/rule110_2-1.png?w=499" src="https://ptrrupprecht.files.wordpress.com/2021/12/rule110_2-1.png?w=499" alt="" class="wp-image-7012" srcset="https://ptrrupprecht.files.wordpress.com/2021/12/rule110_2-1.png 499w, https://ptrrupprecht.files.wordpress.com/2021/12/rule110_2-1.png?w=150 150w, https://ptrrupprecht.files.wordpress.com/2021/12/rule110_2-1.png?w=300 300w" sizes="(max-width: 499px) 100vw, 499px" /></figure></div>



<p>The pattern is surprisingly complex, despite the simplicity of the rule. For example, how can one explain the large solitary black triangle in the middle right? How the vertical line of equally sized triangles in the center that ends so abruptly? The answers are not obvious. These examples show that a very simple rule can lead to very complex patterns. From Hiesinger&#8217;s point of view, it is important to state that the <em>endpoint </em>of the system, let&#8217;s say line 267, cannot be derived from the rule &#8211; unless it is developed (<em>unfolded</em>) for exactly 267 iterations. Hiesinger believes that this analogy can be transferred to the relationship between the genetic code and the architecture of the brain.</p>



<p>The rest of Hiesinger’s book discusses the implications of this concept. As a side-effect, Hiesinger illustrates how complex the genome is in comparison with the simple 101 automaton. Not only is the code richer and more complex, but it is also, due to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transcription_factor">transcription factor</a> cascades that include feedback loops, a system of rules where rules, unlike rule 110, <em>change </em>over time with development. Therefore, according to Hiesinger, the classical research in developmental biology that tries to match single genes (or a few genes) onto a specific function is ill-guided. He convincingly argues that the examples for such relationships that have been found as “classical” examples for the field (e.g., genes coding for cell adhesion molecules involved in establishing synaptic specificity) are probably the exception rather than the rule.</p>



<p>The implication of the <em>unfolding </em>hypothesis for research on artificial intelligence is, interestingly, very similar. That is, to stop treating intelligent systems like engineered systems, where the rules can be fully designed. Since the connection between the generative rules and the resulting endpoint system cannot be understood unless their unfolding in time is observed, Hiesinger is in favor of research that embraces this limitation. He suggests to build models based on a to-be-optimized (“genetic”) code and, letting go of the full control, make them unfold in time to generate an artificial intelligence. Of course, this idea reminds of the existing field of evolutionary algorithms. However, in classic evolutionary algorithms, evolving properties of the code are more or less directly mapped to properties of the network or the agent. If I understood the book right, it would be in Hiesinger’s spirit to make this mapping more indirect through developmental steps that allow for higher complexity, even though it would also obfuscate the mechanistic connection between rules and models.</p>



<p>Overall, I find Hiesinger’s approach interesting. He shows mastery of other fields as well, but it is pncing point that the idea of the unfolding code, the self-assembling brain, is reasonable, and he also brings up examples of research that goes into that direction. However, as a note of caution to myself, accepting the idea of self-assembly seemed a bit like giving in when faced with complexity. There is a long history of complexity research that agreed on the fact that things are too complex to be understood. Giving in resulted in giving vague names to the complex phenomena, which seemed to explain away the unknown but in reality only gave it a name. For example, the concepts of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergence">emergence</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autopoiesis">autopoiesis</a> or the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_energy_principle">free energy principle</a> are in my opinion relatively abstract and non-concrete concepts that contributed to the halting of effective research by preventing incremental progress on more comprehensible questions. I get similar vibes when Hiesinger states that the connections between the self-organizing rules and the resulting product are too complex to be understood and require <em>unfolding </em>in time. The conclusion of this statement is either that everything is solved, because the final explanation is unfolding in time of a code that cannot be understood; or it is that nothing can be solved because it is too complex. In both cases, there seems to be some sort of logical dead end. But this just as a note of caution to myself.</p>



<p>So, what is the use of the <em>unfolding </em>hypothesis about the organization and self-assembly of the brain? I think it is useful because it might help guide future efforts. I agree with Hiesinger that the field of &#8220;artificial intelligence&#8221; should shift its focus on self-organized and growing neuronal networks. In my opinion, work focusing on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolutionary_algorithm">evolutionary algorithms</a>, actor-based <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reinforcement_learning">reinforcement learning</a> (e.g., something called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuroevolution">neuroevolution</a>), <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neural_architecture_search">neural architecture search</a> or more generally <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automated_machine_learning">AutoML</a> go into the right direction. Right now it seems a long shot to say this, but my guess is that these forms of artificial neuronal networks will become dominant within 10 years, potentially replacing artificial neuronal networks based on backpropagation. &#8211; After finishing the write-up, I came across <a href="https://sebastianrisi.com/self_assembling_ai/">a blog post by Sebastian Risi</a> that is a good starting point with up-to-date references on self-assembling algorithms from the perspective of computer science and machine learning &#8211; check it out if you want to know more.</p>



<p>For neurobiology, on the other hand, the <em>unfolding </em>hypothesis means that an understanding of the brain requires understanding of its self-assembly. Self-assembly can happen, as Hiesinger stresses, during development, but it can also happen in the developped circuit through neuronal plasticity (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synaptic_plasticity">synaptic plasticity</a> on short and long time scales, as well as <a href="http://www.scholarpedia.org/article/Intrinsic_plasticity">intrinsic plasticity</a>). I have written about this self-organizing aspect of neuronal circuits in <a href="https://gcamp6f.com/2021/01/01/annual-report-of-my-intuition-about-the-brain-2020/">my last year&#8217;s write-up</a>. Beyond that, if we were to accept the unfolding hypothesis as central to the organization of the brain, we would also be pressured to drop some of the beautiful models of the brain that are based on engineering concepts like modularity. For example, the idea of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cortical_column">cortical column</a>, the <a href="https://direct.mit.edu/neco/article-abstract/1/4/480/5502/A-Canonical-Microcircuit-for-Neocortex">canonical microcircuit</a>, or the concept of segregated neuronal cell types. All those concepts have been obviously very useful frameworks or hypotheses to advance our understanding of the brain, but if the unfolding of the brain is indeed the main concept of its assembly, these engineering concepts are unlikely (although not impossible) to turn out to be true.</p>



<p>It is possible that most of the ideas are already contained in the first few pages, and the rest of the book is less dense and feels often a bit redundant. But especially the historical perspective in the beginning and also some later discussions are very interesting. Language-wise, the book could have benefitted from a bit more inference by the editor to avoid unnaturally sounding sentences, especially during the first couple of pages. But this is only a minor drawback of an otherwise clear and nice presentation. </p>

<p>The book is structured into ten “seminars”, which are each of them a slightly confusing mix of book chapter and lecture style. Each of the &#8220;seminars&#8221; is accompanied by a staged discussion between four actors: a developmental biologist, an AI researcher, a circuit neuroscientist and a robotics engineer (see the photo above). Theoretically, this is a great idea. In practice, it works only half of the time, and the book loses a bit of its natural flow because the direction is a bit missing. However, these small drawbacks are acceptable because the main ideas are interesting and enthusiastically presented.</p>



<p>Altogether, Hiesinger’s book is worth the time to read it, and I can recommend it to anybody interested in the intersection of biological brains, artificial neuronal networks and self-organized systems.</p>

                2021 was – as is always the case – a busy year at Retraction Watch. How could it not be, with our database of retractions surpassing 30,000 – and then 32,000 – with ten percent happening this year alone? Oh, and the pandemic. There were 72 retractions on our list of retracted COVID-19 papers when &#8230; <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2021/12/30/2021-a-review-of-the-years-3200-retractions/" class="more-link">Continue reading <span class="screen-reader-text">2021: A review of the year&#8217;s 3,200 retractions</span></a>

                <p><em>Science News</em> drew over 21 million visitors to our website this year. Here’s a rundown of the most-read news stories and long reads of 2021.</p>



<h4>Top news stories</h4>



<h5>1. Space station detectors found the source of weird ‘blue jet’ lightning</h5>



<p>Instruments on the International Space Station detected the origins of an odd type of lightning called a blue jet. The bizarre bolt is <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/space-station-detectors-found-source-weird-blue-jet-lightning">sparked by a “blue bang”</a> — a flash of bright blue light that may be brought on by the turbulent mixing of oppositely charged regions within a thundercloud (<em>SN: 2/13/21, p. 14</em>).</p>





<h5>2. A newfound quasicrystal formed in the first atomic bomb test</h5>



<p>The first atomic bomb test, in 1945, forged a peculiar, glassy material called trinitite — and within it, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/new-quasi-crystal-formed-first-atomic-bomb-test">a rare form of matter called a quasicrystal</a>. Quasicrystals’ atoms are arranged in an orderly structure like normal crystals, but the structure’s pattern doesn’t repeat (<em>SN: 6/19/21, p. 12</em>).</p>



<h5>3. An Indigenous people in the Philippines have the most Denisovan DNA</h5>



<p>The Ayta Magbukon people in the Philippines set the record for the highest known level of Denisovan ancestry — <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/indigenous-people-philippines-denisovan-dna-genetics">about 5 percent of their DNA comes from the ancient hominids</a>. The finding suggests that several Denisovan populations independently reached Southeast Asia and interbred with <em>Homo sapiens</em> groups that arrived thousands of years later (<em>SN: 9/11/21, p. 16</em>).</p>



<h5>4. Astronomers may have seen a star gulp down a black hole and explode</h5>



<p>In a first, astronomers caught a glimpse of <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/astronomy-star-swallow-black-hole-supernova-cosmology">a rare double cosmic cannibalism</a>: A star swallowed a black hole or neutron star, which then gobbled that star from within, resulting in an astonishing explosion (<em>SN: 10/9/21 &amp; 10/23/21, p. 6</em>).</p>



<h5>5. Frog skin cells turned themselves into living machines</h5>



<p>Skin stem cells plucked from frog embryos organized themselves into miniature living robots, dubbed “xenobots,” that <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/frog-skin-cells-self-made-living-machines-xenobots">can swim, move around debris and even self-heal</a>. Xenobots may one day serve a useful purpose, but ethical questions need to be considered (<em>SN: 4/24/21, p. 8</em>).</p>

The video — accompanying the story “<a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/rabbit-handstand-front-paws-gene-defect-video">A gene defect may make rabbits do handstands instead of hop</a>” (<em>SN: 4/24/21, p. 13</em>) — shows a sauteur d’Alfort rabbit walking on its front paws (below). Such hop-less bunnies may have adopted the odd gait because of a mutation in a gene called <em>RORB</em>, scientists discovered.</p>

<h5>1. New drugs that block a brain chemical are game changers for some migraine sufferers</h5>



<p>A class of drugs that inhibits a neurotransmitter called calcitonin gene-related peptide is helping some patients who suffer from <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/migraine-headache-new-drugs-block-brain-chemical">chronic, debilitating migraines</a> (<em>SN: 3/27/21, p. 16</em>).</p>



<h5>2. Einstein’s theory of general relativity unveiled a dynamic and bizarre cosmos</h5>



<p>Albert Einstein’s general theory of relativity has served as the bedrock of our understanding of the cosmos. In the last 100 years, scientists have confirmed its most radical predictions, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/einstein-theory-general-relativity-gravity-black-holes-cosmos">including black holes, gravitational waves and an expanding universe</a> (<em>SN: 2/13/21, p. 16</em>).</p>



<h5>3. Chemists are reimagining recycling to keep plastics out of landfills</h5>



<p>No matter people’s dedication to sorting and recycling plastics, most still end up in landfills because the materials are too difficult to transform into useful new products. Some chemists <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/chemistry-recycling-plastic-landfills-trash-materials">are trying to change that</a> (<em>SN: 1/30/21, p. 20</em>).</p>



<h5>4. Psychology has struggled for a century to make sense of the mind</h5>



<p>In the last 100 years, psychologists and other social scientists have dug into the muddy “science of us” and developed conflicting theories about human thought and behavior. From the messy, contentious research bloomed <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/psychology-behavior-human-mind-cognition-mental-health">insights into what makes humans tick</a> (<em>SN: 8/14/21, p. 18</em>).</p>



<h5>5. Fossils and ancient DNA paint a vibrant picture of human origins</h5>



<p>From the Taung Child to Lucy, the last century of paleoanthropology has sketched a rough timeline of how humans came to be. Scientists now agree that human evolution has its roots in Africa, but <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/human-evolution-species-origin-fossils-ancient-dna">many mysteries in our history remain to be solved</a> (<em>SN: 9/25/21, p. 20</em>).</p>

<h3>Fusion of the future</h3>



<p>Hopes for making nuclear fusion the clean energy source of the future got a boost in August when a fusion experiment <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/laser-nuclear-fusion-experiment-energy">released 1.3 million joules of energy</a> (<em>SN: 9/11/21, p. 11</em>). A big hurdle for fusion energy has been achieving ignition — the point when a fusion reaction produces more energy than required to trigger it. The test released about 70 percent of the energy used to set off the reaction, the closest yet to the break-even milestone.</p>

<h3>Pig-to-human kidney transplant</h3>



<p>In a first, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/xenotransplantation-pig-human-kidney-transplant">a pig kidney was attached to a human</a>, and the organ functioned normally during 54 hours of monitoring (<em>SN: 11/20/21, p. 6</em>). This successful surgical experiment marks a milestone toward true animal-to-human transplants, which would broaden the supply of lifesaving organs for people in need.</p>

<h3>Death stars</h3>



<p>In a bone-chilling event, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/astronomy-star-swallow-black-hole-supernova-cosmology">astronomers caught a star swallowing a nearby black hole</a>, or perhaps a neutron star, and then getting eaten by its own meal. The resulting spectacular explosion left behind a black hole (<em>SN: 10/9/21 &amp; 10/23/21, p. 6</em>). Astronomers had theorized that such a star-eat-star supernova was possible, but had never observed one.</p>

<h3>Living machines</h3>



<p><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/frog-skin-cells-self-made-living-machines-xenobots">Frog cells transformed themselves into tiny living robots</a> (<em>SN: 4/24/21, p. 8</em>). Scientists removed skin stem cells from frog embryos and watched the cells organize into little blobs dubbed “xenobots” that could swim around and even repair themselves, plus move particles in the environment. Xenobots might someday serve a useful purpose, such as cleaning up waterways, the scientists say.</p>

<h3>Brain teaser</h3>



<p>Scientists got an entirely <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/brain-map-neurons-connections-google-harvard">new view of the brain</a> when they took a tiny piece of a woman’s brain and mapped the varied shapes of 50,000 cells and their 100 million or so connections (<em>SN: 7/3/21 &amp; 7/17/21, p. 6</em>). The vast dataset may help unravel the complexities of the brain.</p>

<h3>Pluses are minuses</h3>



<p>People often <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/psychology-numbers-people-add-default-subtract-better">add even when subtracting is the way to go</a>, scientists found after asking volunteers to tackle a variety of puzzles and problems, including stabilizing a Lego structure and optimizing a travel itinerary (<em>SN: 5/8/21 &amp; 5/22/21, p. 8</em>). The tendency to think in pluses instead of minuses could be at the root of modern-­day excesses like cluttered homes, the researchers speculate.</p>

<h3>Potty training cows</h3>



<p>Can farmers reduce pollution by sending cows to the loo? The answer might very well be yes. In a unique experiment, scientists <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/cow-cattle-pee-potty-training-bathroom-pollution-ammonia">trained cows to answer nature’s call</a> by using a bathroom stall that gathers urine (<em>SN: 10/9/21 &amp; 10/23/21, p. 24</em>). In the future, collected cow urine, which could otherwise pollute the environment, might be used to make fertilizer.</p>

<h4>Crystal clear</h4>



<p>The intense heat and pressure of the first atomic bomb test, in 1945, left behind a glassy substance known as trinitite — and something even stranger. Within the trinitite, scientists discovered, is <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/new-quasi-crystal-formed-first-atomic-bomb-test">a rare form of matter called a quasicrystal</a> (<em>SN: 6/19/21, p. 12</em>). Quasicrystals have an orderly structure like a normal crystal, but that structure doesn’t repeat. Previously, these crystals had been found only in meteorites or made in the lab.</p>

<p>A foul-smelling Southeast Asian plant named <em>Sapria himalayana </em>has <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/reeking-parasitic-sapria-plant-lost-body-much-genetic-code">lost about 44 percent of the genes found in most other flowering plants</a> (<em>SN: 3/13/21, p. 13</em>). <em>S. himalayana</em> parasitizes other plants to get nutrients, so it’s not so surprising that it has entirely purged its chloroplast DNA. Chloroplasts are the structures where photosynthesis, or food making, typically occurs. <em>S. himalayana</em> appears to steal more than nutrients — more than 1 percent of its genes come from other plants, perhaps current or past hosts.</p>

<h4>DNA accounting</h4>



<p>Identical twins may not be genetically identical, after all. They differ by <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/some-identical-twins-dont-have-identical-dna-genetics">5.2 genetic changes on average</a>, researchers reported (<em>SN: 1/30/21, p. 15</em>). That means differences between such twins may not be solely due to environmental influences. In other DNA accounting, scientists estimated that <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/only-a-tiny-fraction-of-our-dna-is-uniquely-human">1.5 percent to 7 percent of modern human DNA</a> is uniquely human, distinct from the DNA of Neandertals, Denisovans and other ancient relatives (<em>SN: 8/14/21, p. 7</em>).</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/2021-science-stories-updates-mosquitoes-malaria-tulsa-wildfires">How some of 2021’s major science stories evolved over time</a></h4>

              
                <p>A story doesn’t necessarily end once it goes online. Here, <em>Science News</em> offers status updates on some evolving stories we reported on earlier this year.</p>



<h4>Tulsa massacre answers</h4>



<p>This year marked the 100th anniversary of a race massacre in Tulsa, Okla., in which a mob of white people invaded the prosperous Black neighborhood of Greenwood. The death toll is estimated to be in the hundreds, though the exact number is unknown, as is the exact location where victims were buried. In May, Helen Thompson reported on a collaboration between scientists, historians and community leaders to investigate an area in Oaklawn Cemetery that <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/tulsa-1921-race-massacre-mass-grave-greenwood-archaeology-dna">may hold a mass grave of victims</a> (<em>SN: 5/27/21</em>).</p>



<p><strong>Update</strong>: In June, archaeologists announced they had found 34 coffins at Oaklawn and were analyzing remains from 19 of them. Preliminary findings suggest the remains belonged to children and adults, forensic anthropology lead Phoebe Stubblefield said June 25 at a <a href="https://www.facebook.com/watch/live/?ref=watch_permalink&amp;v=338768600964239">news conference</a>. Based on skull facial features, “ancestry so far when we can detect it has been primarily of African descent,” she said. One man had a bullet embedded in his shoulder, along with trauma consistent with expectations for the massacre’s victims, the project’s archaeology lead, Kary Stackelbeck, told <em>Science News</em> in November. The full analysis, expected to be released in early 2022, aims to determine the race, sex, age and any trauma patterns of all the recovered individuals. Those results will help determine the project’s next steps.</p>





<p>“This process has been a very sobering, very powerful experience,” Kavin Ross, chairman of the public oversight committee, said at the news conference. “We are so hopeful for more findings.”</p>





<h4>Finally, a malaria vaccine</h4>



<p>In June, Erin Garcia de Jesús reported that two malaria vaccine candidates <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/malaria-vaccine-live-parasites-drugs-results-small-trial">showed promise in small clinical trials</a> (<em>SN: 6/30/21</em>). One jab — tested in children in Burkina Faso — had 77 percent efficacy against malaria symptoms. The other, tested in adults from the United States, had around 87 percent efficacy against infection when paired with infection-fighting drugs. The results sparked hope that the world’s first approved malaria vaccine would soon become a reality.</p>



<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> Well, it happened, but for a different vaccine. In October, <a href="https://www.who.int/news/item/06-10-2021-who-recommends-groundbreaking-malaria-vaccine-for-children-at-risk">the World Health Organization gave a thumbs up to a vaccine</a> that was further along in testing, approving it for children who live in sub-Saharan Africa and other places with the deadliest species of the malaria-causing parasite, <em>Plasmodium falciparum</em>. Of the estimated 409,000 people who died from malaria in 2019, two-thirds were under age 5. Although groundbreaking, the vaccine — called RTS,S or Mosquirix — is not a magic bullet. The four-dose regimen prevents only about 4 in 10 malaria cases and 3 in 10 severe cases. Still, RTS,S plus existing tools could “save tens of thousands of young lives each year,” WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said in an October 6 statement.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<h4>GM mosquitoes hatch in Florida</h4>



<p>After about a decade of fierce debate, genetically modified mosquitoes flew free in the United States for the first time. Starting in April, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/mosquito-genetically-modified-us-florida-keys-pest-control-zika-dengue">modified eggs were deposited in several test spots</a> in the Florida Keys, Susan Milius reported (<em>SN: 5/14/21</em>). Designed as living pesticides by the biotech company Oxitec, male GM <em>Aedes aegypti</em> mosquitoes mate with local females of this hard-to-eradicate species and pass along a gene that kills daughters in the wild before they can bite. Sons grow up to trick more females into doomed mating. Eventually, the population of this spreader of dengue and Zika should dwindle.</p>



<p><strong>Update</strong>: GM males that hatched from eggs succeed in wooing Floridian females, test watchers report. After two temporary stops for big storms, managers restarted periodic releases and kept tests running into November. In August, Oxitec asked the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency to allow two more years of testing in the Keys. The company also asked to start testing in to “up to 84,600 total acres” in California, which identified its first <em>Ae. aegypti</em> mosquito in 2013. Today, the pest is scattered throughout the state. In California, travelers account for all of the state’s dengue and Zika cases. But <em>Ae. aegypti</em> might someday spread these diseases within the state.</p>

<h4>Wildfire extinction threats</h4>



<p>In March, John Pickrell reported on how Australia’s wildlife was faring a year after the country’s devastating 2019–20 wildfires. Experts feared that more than 500 <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/australia-wildfires-extinction-threat-species-one-year-later">species may have become endangered</a> — and some even extinct (<em>SN: 3/9/21</em>). While some of these species were charismatic marsupials such as the koala, many were plants and invertebrates that typically garner far less attention.</p>



<p><strong>Update</strong>: A larger analysis published in July showed that <a href="https://www.nespthreatenedspecies.edu.au/media/b2oi2hyc/8-3-1-assessment-of-the-impacts-of-the-2019-20-wildfires-of-southern-and-eastern-australia-on-invertebrate-species-final-report_v3.pdf">as many as 14,000 invertebrate species</a> had some part of their ranges badly burned by the fires. Jess Marsh, an arachnologist at Murdoch University in Perth, Australia, says that researchers are formally adding 60 of about 240 invertebrate species that earlier in the year they suspected had become endangered to the International Union for Conservation of Nature’s <a href="https://www.iucnredlist.org/">Red List of Threatened Species</a>. But in a rare piece of good news, surveys in March and September turned up multiple individuals of two species that researchers had feared were extinct: the Kangaroo Island assassin spider (<em>Zephyrarchaea austini</em>) and Palethorpe’s pinwheel snail (<em>Rhophodon palethorpei</em>). Finding two assassin spiders that had managed to hang on in a tiny patch of unburnt habitat was “amazing,” Marsh says.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

                <p>While a flurry of missions crowded around Mars this year, some lesser-explored parts of the solar system are about to get fresh eyes.</p>



<p>Three countries visited the Red Planet in 2021, sending orbiters, landers, rovers and even a helicopter. The United Arab Emirates successfully put <a href="https://www.emiratesmarsmission.ae/">its first interplanetary spacecraft, called Hope</a>, into orbit in February, to study Mars’ climate. China’s <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/china-first-mars-rover-landed-sending-photos">Zhurong rover</a> has been trundling around the planet’s surface since May, studying the local geology and searching for underground water ice (<em>SN Online: 5/19/21</em>). And NASA’s <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/mars-how-watch-nasa-perseverance-lander-touch-down">Perseverance rover, which landed</a> in February, has been collaborating with <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/nasa-ingenuity-helicopter-mission-extended-mars-perseverance">a helicopter called Ingenuity</a> to explore an ancient lake bed and collect rocks for a future delivery mission to Earth (<em>SN Online: 2/17/21</em>; <em>SN Online: 4/30/21</em>).</p>



<p>But while all eyes were on Mars, other missions are embarking on journeys to study even more far-flung places. After years of delays and billions of dollars over budget, the James Webb Space Telescope is finally set to launch, no earlier than December 25, to probe the universe’s earliest galaxies, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/james-webb-space-telescope-launch-space-science-cosmos-exoplanets">among other things</a> (<em>SN: 10/9/21 &amp; 10/23/21, p. 26</em>).</p>



<p>Meanwhile, spacecraft are heading off to visit 11 asteroids in the solar system in search of clues to the origins of the planets, and water and life on Earth, as well as ways to keep our planet safe from errant space rocks.</p>





<p>Let’s meet those rock explorers.</p>

<h3>Lucy</h3>



<p><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/nasa-lucy-first-mission-trojan-asteroids-launch-space">NASA’s Lucy spacecraft</a> launched on October 16 on the first mission to explore <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/asteroid-jupiters-orbit-goes-its-own-way">Jupiter’s Trojan asteroids</a>, two groups of space rocks that share an orbit with Jupiter around the sun (<em>SN Online: 10/15/21</em>;<em> SN: 5/13/17, p. 5</em>). The asteroids occupy areas known as Lagrange points, where the gravitational pulls of Jupiter and the sun cancel each other out. These regions are like cosmic dead zones and have been collecting planetary flotsam for billions of years. Those asteroids and other bits of debris are like fossils of the early solar system. (Fittingly, the mission was named for the famous <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/lucy-species-brain-skull-heralded-rise-long-childhoods-hominids">hominid fossil Lucy</a>.)</p>



<p>Over the next 12 years, Lucy will make five flybys to observe seven Trojan asteroids, plus one asteroid in the main belt between Mars and Jupiter for good measure. By the end of its mission, Lucy will have visited more objects than any other NASA mission.</p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator" />



<h3>DART</h3>



<p>The next mission to head out was NASA’s Double Asteroid Redirection Test, or DART, which launched November 24 to deliberately ram into an asteroid in an attempt to alter its orbit. That collision will test a technique for deflecting dangerous asteroids that could crash into Earth in the future.</p>



<p>The spacecraft’s destination is a pair of asteroids called <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/asteroid-moon-name-nasa-course-deflection-mission">Didymos and Dimorphos</a> (<em>SN: 8/15/20, p. 5</em>). In late September 2022, DART will crash-land on Dimorphos while moving at about 6.6 kilometers per second, which hopefully will shift its orbit around Didymos. Astronomers on Earth will be able to tell if the test worked by looking for a change in Dimorphos’ orbit time, and the European Space Agency will send a follow-up probe called Hera in 2024.</p>

<h3>Psyche</h3>



<p>Last up is Psyche, which is set to launch in August 2022. The NASA spacecraft will visit 16 Psyche, an asteroid that seems to be made up almost entirely of metal. It may be the exposed core of a protoplanet that lost its outer mantle and crust in cosmic collisions long ago. Since scientists can’t send a mission to Earth’s core, a trip to 16 Psyche may be the closest we can get to a journey to the center of the Earth.</p>



<p>Psyche will arrive at its destination in 2026 and spend 21 months measuring the asteroid’s magnetic field and composition from orbit. One question is <a href="https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/PSJ/abf63b">whether the asteroid truly is a planetary core</a>. Even if not, the asteroid is a new kind of world that no spacecraft has visited before.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/electric-vehicles-cars-climate-change-challenges-2021">How electric vehicles offered hope as climate challenges grew</a></h4>

              
                <p>This was another year of bleak climate news. <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/human-driven-climate-change-pacific-northwest-heat-wave-temperatures">Record heat waves baked the Pacific Northwest</a>. Wildfires raged in California, Oregon, Washington and neighboring states. Tropical cyclones rapidly intensified in the Pacific Ocean. And <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/climate-change-europe-flash-flood-rain-july">devastating flash floods</a> inundated Western Europe and China. Human-caused climate change is sending the world hurtling down a road to more extreme weather events, and we’re running out of time to pump the brakes, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/climate-change-un-ipcc-report-humans">the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change warned in August</a> (<em>SN: 9/11/21, p. 8</em>).</p>



<p>The world needs to dramatically reduce its greenhouse gas emissions, and fast, if there’s any hope of preventing worse and more frequent extreme weather events. That means shifting to renewable sources of energy — and, importantly, decarbonizing transportation, a sector that is now responsible for about a quarter of the world’s carbon dioxide emissions.</p>



<p>But the path to that cleaner future is daunting, clogged with political and societal roadblocks, as well as scientific obstacles. Perhaps that’s one reason why the electric vehicle — already on the road, already navigating many of these roadblocks — swerved so dramatically into the climate solutions spotlight in 2021.</p>



<p>Just a few years ago, many automakers thought electric vehicles, or EVs, might be a passing fad, says Gil Tal, director of the Plug-in Hybrid &amp; Electric Vehicle Research Center at the University of California, Davis. “It’s now clear to everyone that [EVs are] here to stay.”</p>





<p>Globally, EV sales surged in the first half of 2021, increasing by 160 percent compared with the previous year. Even in 2020 — when most car sales were down due to the COVID-19 pandemic — EV sales were up 46 percent relative to 2019. Meanwhile, automakers from General Motors to Volkswagen to Nissan have outlined plans to launch new EV models over the next decade: GM pledged to go all-electric by 2035, Honda by 2040. Ford introduced electric versions of its iconic Mustang and F-150 pickup truck.</p>



<p>Consumer demand for EVs isn’t actually driving the surge in sales, Tal says. The real engine is a change in supply due to government policies pushing automakers to boost their EV production. The European Union’s toughened CO<sub>2</sub> emissions laws for the auto industry went into effect in 2021, and automakers have already bumped up new EV production in the region. China mandated in 2020 that EVs make up 40 percent of new car sales by 2030. Costa Rica has set official phase-out targets for internal combustion engines.</p>



<p>In the United States, where transportation has officially supplanted power generation as the top greenhouse gas–emitting sector, President Joe Biden’s administration set a goal this year of having 50 percent of new U.S. vehicle sales be electric — both plug-in hybrid and all-electric — by 2030. That’s a steep rise over EVs’ roughly 2.5 percent share of new cars sold in the United States today. In September, California announced that by 2035 all new cars and passenger trucks sold in the state must be zero-emission.</p>



<p>There are concrete signs that automakers are truly committing to EVs. In September, Ford announced plans to build two new complexes in Tennessee and Kentucky to produce electric trucks and batteries. Climate change–related energy crises, such as the February failure of Texas’ power system, may also boost interest in EVs, Ford CEO Jim Farley said September 28 on the podcast Columbia Energy Exchange.</p>



<p>“We’re seeing more extreme weather events with global warming, and so people are looking at these vehicles not just for propulsion but for &#8230; other benefits,” Farley said. “One of the most popular features of the F-150 Lightning is the fact that you can power your house for three days” with the truck’s battery.</p>



<h4>More to navigate</h4>



<p>Although the EV market is growing fast, it’s still not fast enough to meet the Paris Agreement goals, the International Energy Agency reported this year. For the world to reach net-zero emissions by 2050 — when carbon emissions added to the atmosphere are balanced by carbon removal — <a href="https://www.iea.org/reports/net-zero-by-2050">EVs would need to climb from the current 5 percent of global car sales to 60 percent by 2030</a>, the agency found.</p>



<p>As for the United States, even if the Biden administration’s plan for EVs comes to fruition, the country’s transportation sector will still fall short of its emissions targets, researchers reported in 2020 in <em>Nature Climate Change</em>. To hit those targets, electric cars would need to <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41558-020-00921-7">make up 90 percent of new U.S. car sales by 2050</a> — or people would need to drive a lot less.</p>



<p>And to truly supplant fossil fuel vehicles, electric options need to meet several benchmarks. Prices for new and used EVs must come down. Charging stations must be available and affordable to all, including people who don’t live in homes where they can plug in. And battery ranges must be extended. Average ranges have been improving. Just five or so years ago, cars needed a recharge after about 100 miles; today the average is about 250 miles, roughly the distance from Washington, D.C., to New York City. But limited ranges and too few charging stations remain a sticking point.</p>



<p>Today’s batteries also require metals that are scarce, difficult to access or produced in mining operations rife with <a href="https://www.cfr.org/blog/why-cobalt-mining-drc-needs-urgent-attention">serious human rights issues</a>. Although there, too, solutions may be on the horizon, including <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/recycled-lithium-ion-battery-charge">finding ways to recycle batteries</a> to alleviate materials shortages (<em>SN: 12/4/21, p. 4</em>).</p>



<p>EVs on their own are nowhere near enough to forestall the worst effects of climate change. But it won’t be possible to slow global warming without them. </p>



<p>And in a year with a lot of grim climate news — both devastating extreme events and maddeningly stalled political action — EVs offered one glimmer of hope.</p>



<p>“We have the technology. It’s not dependent on some technology that’s not developed yet,” Tal says. “The hope is that now we are way more willing to [transition to EVs] than at any time before.”</p>

                <p><em>By</em> <a href="https://twitter.com/mattbwarren">Matthew Warren</a></p>



<p>This time last year, we wrote that Covid-19 had rendered 2020 a <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2020/12/22/our-ten-most-popular-posts-of-2020/">year like no other</a>. Yet it quickly became clear that 2021 was going to be pretty similar, with the pandemic continuing to affect the day-to-day lives even of those of us who were lucky enough not to contract the virus. It’s not surprising, then, that <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2021/11/08/developments-in-psychologys-covid-research/">much of our coverage</a> this year has focused on the work of psychologists studying the <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2021/09/09/first-hand-reports-of-brain-fog-highlight-struggles-of-those-living-with-long-covid/">effects of Covid-19</a> and <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2021/09/15/domestic-violence-increased-during-lockdown-in-the-united-states/">lockdowns</a>.</p>



<p>But the year also began with some hope: vaccines had just been approved, and were being rolled out across the world. Unfortunately, alongside this massive public health effort there was a proliferation of conspiracy theories and misinformation. So we’ve also focused on <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2021/02/23/belief-in-conspiracy-theories-is-associated-with-lower-levels-of-critical-thinking/">efforts</a> to <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2021/08/20/conspiracy-theories-are-more-entertaining-than-the-truth-and-this-helps-explain-why-people-believe-them/">understand how false information spreads</a> — <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2021/07/06/how-should-you-talk-to-a-loved-one-who-believes-in-conspiracy-theories/">and how to combat it</a>.</p>



<p>For me, the year began with hope of another kind: on 1<sup>st</sup> January I became a father. It’s no coincidence that a lot of <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2021/04/20/describing-groups-to-children-using-generic-language-can-accidentally-teach-them-social-stereotypes/">my</a> <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2021/06/15/at-just-16-months-old-toddlers-will-reward-someone-for-acting-fairly/">own</a> posts this year have been about child development. And while I was off on parental leave, <em>Research Digest </em>welcomed Emma Barratt, whose fascinating articles covered everything from <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2021/11/04/massive-study-finds-no-link-between-time-spent-playing-video-games-and-wellbeing/">video games</a> to <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2021/11/22/body-maps-reveal-the-range-of-sensations-and-feelings-experienced-during-hallucinations/">hallucinations</a> — and yes, <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2021/09/22/the-pandemic-has-left-us-wanting-more-personal-space-even-in-virtual-reality/">Covid-19</a>.</p>



<p>So it’s been a year of ups and downs — and this is reflected in our most popular posts of the year, which are as wide-ranging as ever&#8230;</p>

<p><a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2021/09/07/hand-gestures-help-students-mentally-organise-new-information/"><strong>10) Hand Gestures Help Students Mentally Organise New Information</strong></a></p>



<p>Teachers might want to consider using more hand gestures in class, according to this study we covered in September. The researchers found that students were better at making inferences based on material they had just learned if their instructor had used “structure gestures”, which allocate spoken information to physical space. The team thinks this is because these gestures provide a scaffold that students can use to mentally organise information.  </p>

<p><a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2021/02/23/belief-in-conspiracy-theories-is-associated-with-lower-levels-of-critical-thinking/"><strong>9) Belief In Conspiracy Theories Is Associated With Lower Levels Of Critical Thinking</strong></a></p>



<p>This year’s vaccination drive was a huge public health undertaking — and one that inevitably attracted a small but vocal group of conspiracy theorists. This post from February looked at one factor associated with believing in conspiracy theories: reduced levels of critical thinking. Although the work is limited by its correlational design, it suggests that fostering critical thinking skills may help to protect people against conspiratorial thinking. And for practical advice on how to talk to loved ones who may have fallen for a conspiracy theory, <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2021/07/06/how-should-you-talk-to-a-loved-one-who-believes-in-conspiracy-theories/">check out our feature</a> from July.</p>

<p><a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2021/03/05/it-turns-out-you-can-bullshit-a-bullshitter-after-all/"><strong>8) It Turns Out You Can Bullshit A Bullshitter After All</strong></a></p>



<p>We all love a pithy saying — but they’re not always the most reliable sources of information about how the world works. This year, for instance, researchers found that it’s not true to say that “You can’t bullshit a bullshitter”. Using the delightfully-named “Bullshitting Frequency Scale” and “Bullshit Receptivity Scale”, the team found that people who bullshit out of a desire to impress or persuade others are also more susceptible to believing bullshit themselves. (See also “Money can’t buy happiness” — <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2021/07/01/cant-buy-happiness-research-on-money-digested/">it’s a bit more complicated than that</a>).</p>

<p>Tolerance is often seen as a virtue — and yet, if you “tolerate” someone, you’re not exactly giving them a warm welcome. This study found that for people from ethnic minority backgrounds, the experience of being tolerated is actually closer to discrimination than it is to acceptance.</p>

<p><a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2021/03/16/how-to-cope-with-failure-according-to-psychology/"><strong>6) How To Cope With Failure, According To Psychology</strong></a></p>



<p>Countless articles tell us how to set ourselves up for success and live our best lives. But it’s equally important — or perhaps <em>more </em>important — that we learn how to deal with the inevitable failures. So in March we highlighted five evidence-based tips for coping with failure.  </p>

<p><a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2021/10/25/study-explores-personalities-of-people-with-adult-separation-anxiety-a-neglected-clinical-syndrome/"><strong>5) Study Explores Personalities Of People With Adult Separation Anxiety, A “Neglected Clinical Syndrome”</strong></a></p>



<p>Separation anxiety in children is a well-known phenomenon. But a paper we covered in October looked at how it manifests in adults — and whether it is related to any particular personality traits. The team found links between adult separation anxiety and a number of personality measures, including negative emotionality, absorption, and aggression.</p>

<p>A story about cats <em>and</em> optical illusions?! No wonder it was one of our most read of the year.</p>

<p>We tend to think that an accused person who makes an angry denial is more likely to be guilty than one who reacts calmly. And yet, this study showed, anger isn’t a good sign of guilt — in fact, it may be more likely that an angry person is innocent. </p>

<p>What kind of person thinks it’s OK to end a relationship by just disappearing? This study provided some clues, finding that people with Machiavellian and psychopathic traits are particularly likely to think that ghosting is acceptable.</p>

<p>I remember completing an exercise at school that taught me whether I was a “visual”, “auditory”, or “kinaesthetic” learner. The only issue? It’s simply not true that we each have a specific &#8220;learning style&#8221; that works best for us. And yet most educators continue to believe this myth. This paper reviewed existing work on the topic, finding that a whopping 89% of teachers or trainees across studies subscribed to the idea of learning styles.</p>

                <h2>What am I really doing?</h2>
<p>RPM packaging with Fedora. RPM files are like zip files (compressed) composed of different softwares mixed to work together.</p>
<p>Let's just say an RPM packager does the packaging so users can simply use a command line to install softwares e.g </p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code>$ sudo dnf install fedora-packager
</code></pre></div>

<p>Before Outreachy I did not have the slightest idea of what packaging was all about as a matter of fact it was completely new to me.</p>
<h2>How it all started</h2>
<p>Scrolling through lists of outreachy projects, I came accross the NeuroFedora project and I picked interest in it because it did not require much (lol) ... I joined the Fedora community and jeez I was lost, everything was so new I just wanted to give up, but I saw other applicants curious and asking questions. So I decided to give it a try. </p>
<p>I read the docs sent by our mentor (Ankur Sinha) </p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://fedoramagazine.org/rpm-packages-explained">RPM Packages explained</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Well... I was getting a hang of it but not so much and gosh I was intimidated by how much my collegues were picking up already. I decided to write my mentor (private) and he replied! He led me to the open chat where I mustered up courage to ask questions about my uncertainties and within few weeks I was already packaging for Fedora. </p>
<p>The most interesting part is till now I "always" get stuck on projects and still seek help from my mentor and community members.  I've learnt through the journey that no one really knows it all but you can strive for mastery by consistency, openess, and willingness. </p>

                <img width="140" height="110" src="https://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2021/12/1_efxp_yDIauT01oILEJjrVw-140x110.png" class="attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image" alt="" style="display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear:both;" /><p>When patients start dialysis, the overall goal is for these treatments to become part of their lives and try to maintain as much of their daily routine including family commitments and employment. Unfortunately, this situation is not the norm. It is known that end-stage kidney disease impacts quality of life and is often associated with feelings of loss of control or loss of their previous routines.  Employment has a role in feelings of self-sufficiency and productiveness beyond the financial impact. Maintaining employment can be difficult with the time-consuming treatments, disease-related symptoms, or the physical requirements of previous employment. <a href="https://bmcnephrol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12882-021-02552-2">Kirkeskov <em>et al.</em></a> conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis regarding employment rates in adults receiving dialysis or a kidney transplant. They found between January 1966 and August 2020 the employment rate for dialysis patients was 26.3%. This is similar to what is seen in individual countries. <a href="https://cjasn.asnjournals.org/content/13/2/265.long">Erickson <em>et al.</em></a> had a similar percentage (23-24%) among patients starting dialysis in the United States between 1996 and 2013. Kirkeskov <em>et al.</em> also examined employment around the time of transplant.  They found the employment rate was 36.9% pre-transplant and 38.2% post-transplant.</p>
<p>In this article, the predictors for employment during dialysis and post-transplant were male gender, absence of diabetes, peritoneal dialysis, and higher educational level.  This correlates with an older study from 1996 by <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8678064/">Curtin <em>et al.</em></a> In this study, they conducted a survey of dialysis patients to identify characteristics of those employed vs unemployed.  They found that pre-dialysis employment and higher educational level are associated with a significantly higher likelihood of employment rates. Those patients with higher education usually have white-collar jobs, receive salaries greater than disability benefits, often do not have physical requirements related to their work, and have jobs that can provide accommodations for disabilities. While there may be some options such as disability, this often will not provide the same income level as before.</p>
<p>Looking at the dialysis population, many are on disability because they find it too difficult to continue working because of symptoms from end-stage kidney disease, post-dialysis fatigue, or the inability to be able to take on a different role at work. There are several jobs that individuals are not eligible for once they are on certain medications or have certain conditions. Currently, there are not many options for vocational rehabilitation for individuals that can no longer perform their job duties due to having kidney disease.  This further puts a burden on those with reduced resources. Home dialysis modalities may help with some of the challenges by allowing patients for flexibility with the timing of treatments to maintain a routine work schedule. In the <a href="https://bmcnephrol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12882-021-02552-2"><em>BMC Nephrology</em> article</a>, peritoneal dialysis was associated with employment and most likely similar patterns would be seen with home hemodialysis. But, this won’t address all the challenges that impact employment. Advocacy for vocational rehab or for work accommodations such as part-time schedules or to adjust for individuals&#8217; physical limitations needs to be part of the discussion.</p>
<p>Posttransplantation, there is an expectation that individuals can return to more normal routines as they are freed up from dialysis treatments. For those that had been on dialysis for many years prior to transplantation or had to stop working, there may be some challenges of re-entering the workforce. These are considerations that should be part of discussions with health care providers and patients.</p>
<p>What can we do as a nephrology community to help patients stay employed or rejoin the workforce? What resources do patients need?</p>
