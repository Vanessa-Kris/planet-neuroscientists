              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/extreme-climate-reptile-evolution-permian-extinction">Extreme climate shifts long ago may have helped drive reptile evolution</a></h4>

              
                <p>There’s nothing like a big mass extinction to open up ecological niches and clear out the competition, accelerating evolution for some lucky survivors. Or is there? A new study suggests that the rate of climate change may play just as large a role in speeding up evolution.</p>



<p>The study focuses on reptile evolution across 57 million years — before, during and after <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/volcanic-eruptions-depleted-ocean-oxygen-may-have-set-great-dying">the mass extinction</a> at the end of the Permian Period (<em>SN: 12/6/18</em>)<em>.</em> That extinction event, triggered by carbon dioxide pumped into the atmosphere and oceans through increased volcanic activity about 252 million years ago, knocked out a whopping 86 percent of Earth’s species. Yet reptiles recovered from the chaos relatively well. Their exploding diversity of species around that time has been widely regarded as a result of their slithering into newly available niches.</p>





<p>But rapid climate fluctuations were already taking place much earlier in the Permian, and so were surges of reptile diversification, researchers say. Analyzing fossils from 125 reptile species shows that bursts of evolutionary diversity in reptiles <a href="http://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.abq1898">were tightly correlated with relatively rapid fluctuations in climate</a> throughout the Permian and millions of years into the next geologic period, the Triassic, researchers report August 19 in <em>Science Advances</em>.</p>



<p>Scientists’ understanding of evolution is expanding as they become more tuned into the connection between it and environmental change, says Jessica Whiteside, a geologist at the University of Southampton in England who works on mass extinctions but was not involved in the new work. “This study is bound to become an important part of that conversation.”</p>



<p>To investigate reptile evolution, evolutionary paleobiologist Tiago Simões of Harvard University and colleagues precisely measured and scanned reptile fossils ranging from 294 million to 237 million years old. In all, the researchers examined 1,000 specimens at 50 research institutions in 20 countries.  For climate data, the team used an <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-021-25019-2">existing large database of sea surface temperatures</a> based on oxygen isotope data, extending back 450 million years, published in 2021.</p>



<p>By closely tracking changes in body and head size and shape in so many species, paired with that climate data, the researchers found that the faster the rate of climate change, the faster reptiles evolved. The fastest rate of reptile diversification did not occur at the end-Permian extinction, the team found, but several million years later in the Triassic, when climate change was at its most rapid and global temperatures witheringly hot. Ocean surface temperatures during this time soared to 40° Celsius, or 104⁰ Fahrenheit — about the temperature of a hot tub, says Simões.</p>



<p>A few species did evolve less rapidly than their kin, Simões says. The difference? Size. For instance, reptiles with smaller body sizes are already preadapted to live in rapidly warming climates, he says. Due to their greater surface area to body ratio, “small-bodied reptiles can better exchange heat with their surrounding environment,” so stay relatively cooler than larger animals.</p>



<p>“The smaller reptiles were basically being forced by natural selection to stay the same, while during that same period of time, the large reptiles were being told by natural selection ‘You need to change right away or you’re going to go extinct,’” Simões says.</p>



<p>This phenomenon, called the Lilliput effect, is not a new proposal, Simões says, adding that it’s been well established in marine organisms. “But it’s the first time it’s been quantified&nbsp;in limbed vertebrates across this critical period in Earth&#8217;s history.”</p>



<p>Simões and colleagues’ detailed work has refined the complex evolutionary tree for reptiles and their ancestors. But, for now, it’s unclear which played a bigger role in reptile evolution long ago — all those open ecological niches after the end-Permian mass extinction, or the dramatic climate fluctuations outside of the extinction event.</p>



<p>“We cannot say which one was more important,” Simões says. “Without either one, the course of evolution in the Triassic and the rise of reptiles to global dominance in terrestrial ecosystems would have been quite different.”&nbsp;</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/covid-cdc-guidelines-back-to-school-masks-testing-coronavirus">The new CDC guidelines may make back-to-school harder</a></h4>

              
                <p>Across the United States, kids are prepping for back-to-school, or are already in classrooms, and parents are buckling up for another pandemic school year. Like me, many are trying to get a handle on what COVID-19 precautions to take. <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/media/releases/2022/p0811-covid-guidance.html">Updated guidance</a> released last week by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention hasn’t exactly helped. It may have made dealing with back-to-school more confusing — and could even spur new outbreaks.</p>



<p>Last November, my fifth grader had to quarantine at home for 10 days after a close contact tested positive. Now, the CDC has nixed the quarantine recommendation for people exposed to COVID-19. Today, our situation could look something like this: My COVID-exposed daughter would mask for 10 days, test on day five, and remain in school the whole time — only the infected child would isolate. That child would stay home for at least five days after a positive test. Then, if the child is fever-free and symptoms are improving, according to the new guidance, they could pop on a mask and hightail it back to class — no testing needed.</p>





<p>That advice could mean more COVID-19 in classrooms. Scientists have shown that <a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMc2202092?utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email#:~:text=Recently%2C%20the%20Centers%20for%20Disease,by%205%20days%20of%20masking.">people can remain infectious after day five</a>. So without testing for COVID-19, students and teachers won’t know if they’re bringing the disease back to school.&nbsp;</p>



<p>On the same day the CDC’s guidance came out, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration added yet another wrinkle. If you think you’ve been exposed to COVID-19 but test negative with an at-home COVID-19 antigen test, the FDA now recommends testing again … and again. Repeat testing over time cuts the chances <a href="https://www.fda.gov/medical-devices/safety-communications/home-covid-19-antigen-tests-take-steps-reduce-your-risk-false-negative-fda-safety-communication?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery">you’ll miss an infection and unknowingly spread the virus</a>, the FDA advised on August 11.</p>



<p>It’s hard to say how that advice jibes with the CDC’s new, more-relaxed guidelines. Even the agency has <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/08/17/us/politics/cdc-rochelle-walensky-covid.html">said its public guidance during the pandemic</a> has been “confusing and overwhelming,” the <em>New York Times</em> reports. CDC director Rochelle Walensky is now planning a shake-up that could include restructuring the communications office as well as <a href="https://www.npr.org/2022/08/17/1117904729/cdc-reorganization-walensky-covid">relying more on preliminary studies rather than waiting for research to go through peer-review</a>, according to NPR.</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Yesterday, the CDC released new COVID-19 guidelines. Now, some parents are wondering what that means for back-to-school. How do you feel about the changes?</p>&mdash; Science News (@ScienceNews) <a href="https://twitter.com/ScienceNews/status/1558104356821647363?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 12, 2022</a></blockquote><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
</div></figure>



<p>The CDC’s new guidance has sparked a range of reactions, many negative, among scientists, doctors, parents and teachers. In an informal <a href="https://twitter.com/ScienceNews/status/1558104356821647363?s=20&amp;t=r-37z-05BafAr-Cg5-dFvg">Twitter poll of <em>Science News</em> followers</a>, roughly 80 percent of the 353 respondents reported that the new CDC guidance made them feel confused, worried or angry and/or exasperated.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Now, it’s up to local school districts to decide what COVID-19 measures to take. “Just because guidance has changed <a href="https://www.nea.org/about-nea/media-center/press-releases/nea-presidents-statement-new-cdc-guidelines">does not mean COVID is gone</a>,” Becky Pringle, president of the National Education Association labor union, said in a statement. Not by a long shot. The United States is currently averaging nearly <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2021/us/covid-cases.html">500 daily coronavirus deaths</a> and more than <a href="https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#trends_dailycases_select_00">100,000 new cases a day</a>, an almost certain undercount.</p>



<p>As my own children gear up for school, I wonder about <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/covid-coronavirus-cdc-mask-guidelines-metrics-risk">COVID-19’s constantly shifting landscape</a>. Like other families with school-aged children, we’ve bounced from virtual school to in-person mask mandates to mask-optional recommendations. And we still don’t know our district’s plans for the upcoming year. School starts in about a week.</p>



<p>There is reason for hope, though: We know what measures can<a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coronavirus-covid-kids-school-return-parents-questions"> slow COVID-19’s spread </a>in schools. <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/school-mask-mandate-coronavirus-transmission-covid">Masking is a big one</a>. A preliminary study posted August 9 linked <a href="https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.08.09.22278385v1.full-text">lifting school mask mandates</a> in Boston-area K–12 schools with a rise in cases among students and staff. At Boston University, <a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2794964">mandatory masking plus a vaccine mandate</a> seemed to keep the virus in check in classrooms, scientists reported August 5 in <em>JAMA Network Open</em>. Testing can help, too. A computer analysis from England suggests that <a href="https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/full/10.1098/rsos.211985">regularly rapid testing students can curb classroom transmission</a>, scientists report August 10 in the <em>Royal Society Open Science</em>. </p>

<p>But knowing what works is not the same as actually employing evidence-based measures in the classroom, says Anne Sosin, a public health researcher at Dartmouth College whose research focuses on COVID-19 and rural health equity. She has studied how pandemic policies have impacted schools in northern New England. “I worry that we simply have not seen the political leadership to ensure that all children and educators can safely participate in school.”</p>



<p>I spoke with Sosin about the CDC’s new guidance, and what kids and parents might expect heading into the new school year. Our conversation has been edited for length and clarity.</p>



<p><strong><em>SN</em></strong><strong>: What do you think of the updated guidance?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Sosin: </strong>I was very disappointed that the CDC did not adopt a <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/covid-testing-school-works-coronavirus-pandemic-reopening">test-to-exit-isolation</a> recommendation.&nbsp;</p>



<p>What we’re going to see in schools are infected students and educators returning after five days still positive for COVID-19. Multiple studies have demonstrated that most people are infectious beyond five days. Not only is it highly likely that they’ll be seeding outbreaks. They’ll also be putting high-risk members of school communities in danger.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong><em>SN</em></strong><strong>: What could the guidance mean for vulnerable kids?&nbsp;</strong></p>



<p><strong>Sosin</strong>: I think that vulnerable people are going to be in a very precarious situation. The guidance mentions the need to ensure protections for immunocompromised and other high-risk people but there’s a problem of implementation. Will schools actually implement those protections?</p>



<p><strong><em>SN</em></strong><strong>: Do scientists have a good handle on what protections can help?&nbsp;</strong></p>



<p><strong>Sosin</strong>: Definitely. We have really strong evidence showing that when layered mitigation strategies are in place, we can almost eliminate transmission in school settings. That means that we should have upgraded ventilation, lunchroom strategies [like taking kids outside to eat] and testing. And I continue to think that data-driven mask policies have a role to play. Not masking forever, but masking at times when we see an uptick in transmission.</p>



<p><strong><em>SN:</em></strong><strong> How could the new guidance affect different communities across the United States?&nbsp;</strong></p>



<p><strong>Sosin</strong>: Different communities have not only been <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/covid-data/investigations-discovery/hospitalization-death-by-race-ethnicity.html">impacted in dramatically different ways</a>, but they’re also on unequal footing at this stage of the pandemic.</p>



<p>[If we compare white communities with communities of color], we see disparities in vaccination coverage and caregiver loss. Some communities have suffered enormous losses while others have really been untouched. <a href="https://publications.aap.org/pediatrics/article/148/6/e2021053760/183446/COVID-19-Associated-Orphanhood-and-Caregiver-Death">Black children have lost caregivers</a> at more than two times the rate of white children. For Indigenous children, the rate is 4.5 times as high. Those are sharp disparities.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Communities of color also have less access to testing, treatment and health care. I worry that if we don’t have a renewed focus on equity, then we’re just going to see an exacerbation of disparities that have existed throughout the pandemic.</p>



<p><strong><em>SN</em>: What advice do you have for parents as they head into the new school year?&nbsp;</strong></p>



<p><strong>Sosin</strong>: We all want as normal a school year as possible. Masking should be one of the tools we’re ready to employ to keep our kids in the classroom. In addition, we should be advocating that our schools invest in ventilation. Vaccination also represents a critical piece of the strategy.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We see such abysmal vaccination coverage among children. <a href="https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#vaccinations_vacc-people-additional-dose-totalpop">Less than 1 in 3 kids ages 5 to 11 are fully vaccinated</a>. I think many parents no longer see it as important — there’s been this narrative that the pandemic is over. We need clear messaging that vaccination remains an important tool.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Now is a great time to plan back-to-school campaigns to vaccinate kids and to begin to prepare for the arrival of omicron-specific boosters in the fall.</p>

<p><a href="https://bookshop.org/a/21798/9780691197579">The Five-Million-Year Odyssey<br></a><em>Peter Bellwood<br>Princeton Univ., $29.95</em></p>



<p>Archaeologist Peter Bellwood’s academic odyssey wended from England to teaching posts halfway around the world, first in New Zealand and then in Australia. For more than 50 years, he has studied how humans settled islands from Southeast Asia to Polynesia.</p>



<p>So it’s fitting that his new book, a plain-English summary of what’s known and what’s not about the evolution of humans and our ancestors, emphasizes movement. In <em>The</em> <em>Five-Million-Year Odyssey</em>, Bellwood examines a parade of species in the human evolutionary family — he collectively refers to them as <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/human-evolution-species-origin-fossils-ancient-dna">hominins, whereas some others (including <em>Science News</em>) use the term hominids</a> (<em>SN: 9/15/21</em>) — and tracks their migrations across land and sea. He marshals evidence indicating that hominids in motion continually shifted the direction of biological and cultural evolution.</p>





<p>Throughout his tour, Bellwood presents his own take on contested topics. But when available evidence leaves a debate unresolved, he says so. Consider the earliest hominids. Species from at least 4.4 million years ago or more whose hominid status is controversial, such as <em>Ardipithecus ramidus</em>, get a brief mention. Bellwood renders no verdict on whether those finds come from early hominids or ancient apes. He focuses instead on African australopithecines, a set of upright but partly apelike species thought to have included populations that evolved into members of our own genus, <em>Homo</em>, around 2.5 million to 3 million years ago. Bellwood hammers home the point that stone-tool making by the last australopithecines, the first <em>Homo</em> groups or both contributed to the evolution of bigger brains in our ancestors.</p>



<p>The action speeds up when <em>Homo erectus </em>becomes the first known hominid to leave Africa, roughly 2 million years ago. Questions remain, Bellwood writes, about how many such migrations occurred and whether this humanlike species reached distant islands such as Flores in Indonesia, perhaps giving rise to <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/hobbits-died-out-earlier-thought">small hominids called hobbits, or <em>Homo floresiensis</em></a> (<em>SN: 3/30/16</em>). What’s clear is that <em>H. erectus </em>groups journeyed across mainland Asia and at least as far as the Indonesian island of Java.</p>



<p>Intercontinental migrations flourished after <em>Homo sapiens</em> debuted, around 300,000 years ago in Africa. Bellwood regards <em>H. sapiens</em>, Neandertals and Denisovans as distinct species that interbred in certain parts of Asia and Europe. He suggests that Neandertals disappeared around 40,000 years ago as they mated with members of more numerous <em>H. sapiens</em> populations, leaving a genetic legacy in people today. But he does not address an opposing argument that different <em>Homo</em> populations at this time, including Neandertals, were too closely related to have been separate species and that it was<a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/dragon-man-skull-homo-longi-human-evolution-neandertals"> intermittent mating among these mobile groups</a> that drove the evolution of present-day humans (<em>SN: 6/5/21</em>).</p>



<p>Bellwood gives considerable attention to the rise of food production and domestication in Europe and Asia after around 9,000 years ago. He builds on an argument, derived from his 2004 book <em>First Farmers</em>, that expanding populations of early cultivators migrated to new lands in such great numbers that they spread major language families with them. For instance, farmers in what’s now Turkey spread Indo-European languages into much of Europe sometime after roughly 8,000 years ago, Bellwood contends.</p>



<p>He rejects a recent alternative proposal, based on ancient DNA evidence, that <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/how-asian-nomadic-herders-built-new-bronze-age-cultures">horse-riding herders of Central Asia’s Yamnaya</a> culture brought their traditions and Indo-European tongues to Europe around 5,000 years ago (<em>SN: 11/15/17</em>). Too few Yamnaya immigrated to impose a new language on European communities, Bellwood says. Similarly, he argues, ancient Eurasian conquerors, from Alexander the Great to Roman emperors, couldn’t get speakers of regional languages to adopt new ones spoken by their outnumbered military masters.</p>



<p>Bellwood rounds out his evolutionary odyssey with a reconstruction of how early agricultural populations expanded through East Asia and beyond, to Australia, a string of Pacific islands and the Americas. Between about 4,000 and 750 years ago, for instance, sea-faring farmers spread Austronesian languages from southern China and Taiwan to Madagascar in the west and Polynesia in the east. Precisely how they accomplished that remarkable feat remains a puzzle.</p>



<p>Disappointingly, Bellwood doesn’t weigh in on a recent archaeological argument that <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/human-history-society-dawn-of-everything-book">ancient societies were more flexible and complex than long assumed</a> (<em>SN: 11/9/21</em>). On the plus side, his evolutionary odyssey moves along at a brisk pace and, like our ancestors, covers a lot of ground.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The overall winner captures something like out of science fiction &#8211; the fruiting body of a parasitic fungus erupting from the body of a fly. Roberto García-Roa, an evolutionary biologist and conservation photographer affiliated with the University of Valencia (Spain) and Lund University (Sweden), captured this unsettling image in the Peruvian jungle of Tambopata. Roberto explains that “spores of the so-called ‘Zombie’ fungus (e.g. genera </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">Ophiocordyceps</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400">) infect arthropods by infiltrating their exoskeleton and minds. As a result, parasitized hosts are compelled to migrate to a more favourable location for the fungus’s growth. Here, they await death, at which point the fungus feeds on its host to produce fruiting bodies full of spores that will be jettisoned to infect more victims &#8211; a conquest shaped by thousands of years of evolution.” Senior Editorial Board Member Christy Anna Hipsley comments that this image depicting a parasite-host interaction “has a depth and composition that conveys life and death simultaneously &#8211; an affair that transcends time, space, and even species. The death of the fly gives life to the fungus”. </span></p>

<p>The Biodiversity Under Threat category winner was captured by Samantha Kreling from the University of Washington, USA, and shows African elephants sheltering from the Sun under a large baobab tree in Mapungubwe National Park, South Africa as droughts strike. Samantha Kreling said: “Baobab trees can live for more than 2,000 years and store water in their barrel-like trunks when water is scarce. The tree in this image has had its bark stripped by elephants seeking water. Although these trees are usually fast-healing, this damage is more than baobab trees can cope with as temperatures rise due to climate change. This photograph highlights the need for action to prevent the permanent loss of these iconic trees.”</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Lindsey Swierk, an Assistant Research Professor at Binghamton University (State University of New York), submitted the runner-up for this category. Spring in the northeastern United States is arriving earlier and becoming more variable in temperature. This change poses a threat to many spring-breeding amphibians, including wood frogs. Lindsey explains, &#8220;Wood frogs (</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">Rana sylvatica</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400">) are early spring breeders in temperate North America. Lately, wood frogs are breeding earlier in the year as climate change unseasonably warms early spring in the Northeastern USA. Unfortunately, winter storms can still catch frogs unexpectedly and trap them under the ice. Here, a male wood frog clings to an egg mass produced before a freeze; both the egg mass and the frog were recently trapped under ice. The frog survived, but many of the eggs did not.&#8221; Senior Editorial Board Member Josef Settele comments, &#8220;I think it is important to realise that effects of major drivers of biodiversity change can also happen in counter-intuitive ways. In the present case, due to climate warming, there is an increased risk of the frog offspring dying because of cold/freezing (due to severe changes in phenology).&#8221;</span></p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/zombie-fungus-body-fly-photo-contest">An award-winning photo captures a ‘zombie’ fungus erupting from a fly</a></h4>

              
                <p>Sometimes a photo is literally a matter of life, death — and zombies.</p>



<p>This haunting image, winner of the 2022 <em>BMC Ecology and Evolution</em> photography competition, certainly fits that description. It captures the fruiting bodies of a parasitic fungus, emerging from the lifeless body of an infected fly in the Peruvian rainforest.</p>



<p>The fungus-infested fly was one of many images submitted to the contest from all over the world, aiming to showcase the beauty of the natural world and the challenges it faces. The journal <a href="https://www.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12862-022-02049-y">revealed the winners</a> August 18.</p>





<p>Roberto García-Roa, a conservation photographer and evolutionary biologist at the University of Valencia in Spain, took the winning photo while visiting the Tambopata National Reserve, a protected habitat in the Amazon.</p>



<p>The fungus erupting from the fly belongs to the genus <em>Ophiocordyceps, </em>a diverse collection of parasitic fungi known as “zombie fungi,” due to their <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/deadly-fungus-gives-zombie-ants-lockjaw">ability to infect insects and control their minds</a> (<em>SN: 7/17/19</em>).</p>



<p>“There is still much to unravel about the diversity of these fungi as it is likely that each insect species infected succumbs to its own, specialized fungus,” says Charissa de Bekker, an expert in parasitic fungi at Utrecht University in the Netherlands.</p>



<p>First, spores of the fungus land on the ill-fated fly. So begins the manipulative endgame. The spores infiltrate the fly’s exoskeleton before infecting its body and eventually hijacking its mind. Once in control, the fungus uses its new powers of locomotion to relocate to a microclimate more suitable to its own growth — somewhere with the right temperature, light and moisture.</p>



<p>Fungus and fly then bide their time until the fly dies, becoming a food source for the fungus to consume. Fruiting bodies work their way out of the fly, filled with spores that are released into the air to continue the macabre cycle in a new, unsuspecting host. It is a “conquest shaped by thousands of years of evolution,” García-Roa said in a statement announcing the winners.</p>



<p>Research into the molecular aspects of fungal mind control is under way, De Bekker says, including in her own lab. “These fungi harbor all sorts of bioactive chemicals that we have yet to characterize and that could have novel medicinal and pest control applications.”</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/pfas-forever-chemicals-degrade-lye-chemistry">Common, cheap ingredients can break down some ‘forever chemicals’</a></h4>

              
                <p>There’s a new way to rip apart harmful “forever chemicals,” scientists say.</p>



<p>Perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances, also known as PFAS, are found in nonstick pans, water-repellent fabrics and <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/pfas-chemicals-biodegradable-food-containers-compost">food packaging</a> and they are pervasive throughout the environment. They’re nicknamed forever chemicals for their ability to stick around and not break down. In part, that’s because PFAS have a super strong bond between their carbon and fluorine atoms (<em>SN: 6/4/19</em>). Now, using a bit of heat and two relatively common compounds, researchers have <a href="http://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.abm8868">degraded one major type of forever chemical in the lab</a>, the team reports in the Aug. 19 <em>Science.</em> The work could help pave the way for a process for breaking down certain forever chemicals commercially, for instance by treating wastewater.</p>





<p>“The fundamental knowledge of how the materials degrade is the single most important thing coming out of this study,” organic chemist William Dichtel said in an August 16 news conference.</p>



<p>While some scientists have found relatively simple ways of <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/pfas-forever-chemicals-uv-iodide-perfluoroalkyl-polyfluoroalkyl-sulfite">breaking down select PFAS</a>, most degradation methods require harsh, energy-intensive processes using intense pressure — in some cases over 22 megapascals — or extremely high temperatures — sometimes upwards of 1000⁰ Celsius — to break the chemical bonds<em> (SN: 6/3/22)</em>.</p>



<p>Dichtel, of Northwestern University in Evanston, Ill., and his team experimented with two substances found in nearly every chemistry lab cabinet: sodium hydroxide, also known as lye, and a solvent called dimethyl sulfoxide, or DMSO. The team worked specifically with a group of forever chemicals called PFCAs, which contain carboxylic acid and constitute a large percentage of all PFAS. Some of these&nbsp;kinds of forever chemicals are found in water-resistant clothes.</p>



<p>When the team combined PFCAs with the lye and DMSO at 120⁰ C and with no extra pressure needed, the carboxylic acid fell off the chemical and became carbon dioxide in a process called decarboxylation. What happened next was unexpected, Dichtel said. Loss of the acid led to a process causing “the entire molecule to fall apart in a cascade of complex reactions.&#8221; This cascade involved steps that degraded the rest of the chemical into fluoride ions and smaller carbon-containing products, leaving behind virtually no harmful by-products.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; .</p>



<p>“It’s a neat method, it’s different from other ones that have been tried,” says Chris Sales, an environmental engineer at Drexel University in Philadelphia who was not involved in the study. “The biggest question is, how could this be adapted and scaled up?” Northwestern has filed a provisional patent on behalf of the researchers.</p>



<p>Understanding this mechanism is just one step in undoing forever chemicals, Dichtel’s team said. And more research is needed: There are other classes of PFAS that require their own solutions. This process wouldn&#8217;t work to tackle PFAS out in the environment, because it requires a concentrated amount of the chemicals. But it could one day be used in wastewater treatment plants, where the pollutants could be filtered out of the water, concentrated and then broken down.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/mosquito-smell-humans-odor-aedes-aegypti">Why mosquitoes are especially good at smelling you</a></h4>

              
                <p>Some mosquitoes have a near-foolproof thirst for human blood. Previous attempts to prevent the insects from tracking people down by blocking part of mosquitoes’ ability to smell have failed. A new study hints it’s because the bloodsuckers have built-in workarounds to ensure they can always smell us.</p>



<p>For most animals, individual nerve cells in the olfactory system can detect just one type of odor. But <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2022.07.024"><em>Aedes aegypti</em> mosquitoes’ nerve cells can each detect many</a> smells, researchers report August 18 in <em>Cell</em>. That means if a cell were to lose the ability to detect one human odor, it still can pick up on other scents.</p>





<p>The study provides the most detailed map yet of a mosquito’s sense of smell and suggests that concealing human aromas from the insects could be more complicated than researchers thought.</p>



<p>Repellents that block mosquitoes from detecting human-associated scents could be especially tricky to make. “Maybe instead of trying to mask them from finding us, it would be better to find odorants that mosquitoes don’t like to smell,” says Anandasankar Ray, a neuroscientist at the University of California, Riverside who was not involved in the work. Such repellents may <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/science-gets-deets-deet">confuse</a> or <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/how-catnip-plant-repels-insects-mosquitoes-chemical-receptor">irritate</a> the bloodsuckers and send them flying away (<em>SN: 9/21/11; SN: 3/4/21</em>).</p>



<p>Effective repellents are a key tool to prevent mosquitoes from transmitting disease-causing viruses such as <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/scent-zika-dengue-infection-mosquito-lure-acetophenone">dengue and Zika</a> (<em>SN: 7/11/22</em>). “Mosquitoes are responsible for more human deaths than any other creature,” says Olivia Goldman, a neurobiologist at Rockefeller University in New York City. “The better we understand them, the better that we can have these interventions.” &nbsp;</p>



<p>Mosquitoes that feed on people home in on a variety of cues when hunting, including body heat and body odor. The insects smell using their antennae and small appendages close to the mouth. Using three types of sensors in olfactory nerve cells, they can detect chemicals such as <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/good-luck-outsmarting-mosquito">carbon dioxide</a> from exhaled breath or components of body odor (<em>SN: 7/16/15</em>). </p>



<p>In previous work, researchers thought that blocking some sensors might <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/blog/science-ticker/targeting-single-set-nerve-cells-may-block-mosquitoes">hide human scents</a> from mosquitoes by disrupting the smell messages sent to the brain (<em>SN: 12/5/13</em>). But even those sensor-deprived mosquitoes can still smell and bite people, says neurobiologist Margo Herre also of Rockefeller University.</p>



<p>So Goldman, Herre and colleagues added fluorescent labels to <em>A. aegypti </em>nerve cells, or neurons, to learn new details about how the mosquito brain deciphers human odors. Surprisingly, rather than finding the typical single type of sensor per nerve cell, the team found that individual mosquito neurons appear more like sensory hubs.</p>



<p>Genetic analyses confirmed that some of the olfactory nerve cells had more than one type of sensor. Some cells produced electrical signals in response to several mosquito-attracting chemicals found in humans such as octenol and triethyl amine — a sign the neurons could detect more than one type of odor molecule. A separate study published in April in <em>eLife</em> found <a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/72599">&nbsp;similar results in fruit flies</a>, which suggests such a system may be common among insects.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s unclear why having redundant ways of detecting people’s odors might be useful to mosquitoes. “Different people can smell very different from one another,” says study coauthor Meg Younger, a neurobiologist at Boston University. “Maybe this is a setup to find a human regardless of what variety of human body odor that human is emitting.”</p>

<p><strong>During your time at PLOS, what initiative/s have you been involved with that aim to create lasting change in the ways science is communicated</strong>?</p>



<p>In my time at PLOS, I&rsquo;ve had the privilege of launching several new business models &mdash; <a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2022/03/open-access-doesnt-need-apcs-part-iii-flat-fees/">Flat Fees</a>, <a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2022/01/open-access-doesnt-need-apcs-part-1/">Community Action Publishing</a>, and <a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2022/02/open-access-doesnt-need-apcs-part-ii-global-equity/">Global Equity</a> &mdash; that enable more authors to publish open access and engage with open science best practice without paying fees. These models reduce the &ldquo;barrier to entry&rdquo; for researchers from many different backgrounds who do not have the funds to pay APCs. And essentially prove that there is more than one way to cover the cost of Open Access publishing.</p>



<p>To&nbsp; echo what George and Emily have mentioned in their <a href="https://theplosblog.plos.org/2022/08/what-drives-us-ensuring-fair-opportunities-for-all-authors/">post</a>, I think we create more/better science when as many voices as possible can participate &mdash; at the level and the moment that&rsquo;s appropriate for them. Open Access created more opportunities for more people to interact with science when and how it&rsquo;s most meaningful to them. A secondary school teacher interested in new methodologies to support students with special needs in the classroom has a very different level of expertise/accessibility to research than a PhD student. Open Access levels that playing field. But we still need more creative solutions to ensure every <em>author </em>can make their work open if they choose, which is what these models aim to do.</p>



<p><strong>Why do you think this is important for science?</strong></p>



<p>It&rsquo;s important because science is a global, interdisciplinary enterprise. We risk losing vital voices when structural barriers &mdash; like cost &mdash; prevent a researcher from participating in that enterprise. Though we still have a lot of work ahead of us&ndash;much more to improve and to learn about how we can create solutions that work for all authors&ndash;this is a first step in thinking about Open Access differently. These models are leading the way in opening our own PLOS journals to all authors, as well as pushing other publishers &mdash; and academic institutions more broadly&ndash; to think more expansively about what it means to further inclusion in scholarly communication.</p>



<p><strong>What does it mean to you personally to be involved in work like this?</strong></p>



<p>Researchers dedicate their lives and livelihood to doing important work in their communities. If our work to make Open Access publishing more inclusive makes it possible for even <em>one </em>more voice to be heard, amplified, and shared, our work is a success. But we can and mustdo better than just one. PLOS is a global publisher, with a growing portfolio of journals that reach all areas of science and medicine. We have the capacity to make bold changes that reverberate across the scholarly community and lead by example. To be at the forefront of this work and see the pressure it puts on our peers across the industry to make lasting change is extremely gratifying. I&rsquo;m very lucky to part of it.</p>



<p><strong>By the end of your career, what do you hope people will think about your contribution</strong>?</p>



<p>In short, that it changed the way scholarly communication looked at the economics of authorship and participation.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/oort-cloud-comets-spin-death">Oort cloud comets may spin themselves to death</a></h4>

              
                <p>Comets from the solar system’s deep freezer often don’t survive their first encounter with the sun. Now one scientist thinks he knows why: Solar warmth makes some of the cosmic snowballs spin so fast, they fall apart.</p>



<p>This suggestion could help solve a decades-old mystery about <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.04469">what destroys many “long-period” comets</a>, astronomer David Jewitt reports in a study submitted August 8 to arXiv.org. Long-period comets <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/tiny-object-points-remote-solar-system-reservoir">originate in the Oort cloud</a>, a sphere of icy objects at the solar system’s fringe (<em>SN: 8/18/08</em>). Those that survive their first trip around the sun tend to swing by our star only once every 200 years.</p>





<p>“These things are stable out there in the Oort cloud where nothing ever happens. When they come toward the sun, they heat up, all hell breaks loose, and they fall apart,” Jewitt says.</p>



<p>The Dutch astronomer Jan Oort first proposed the Oort cloud as a cometary reservoir in 1950. He realized that many of its comets that came near Earth were first-time visitors, not return travelers. Something was taking the comets out, but no one knew what.</p>



<p>One possibility was that the comets die by sublimating all of their water away as they near the heat of the sun until there’s nothing left. But that didn’t fit with observations of comets that seemed to physically break up into smaller pieces. The trouble was, those breakups are hard to watch in real time.</p>



<p>“The disintegrations are really hard to observe because they’re unpredictable, and they happen quickly,” Jewitt says.</p>



<p>He ran into that difficulty when he tried to observe Comet Leonard, a bright comet that put on a spectacular show in winter 2021–2022. Jewitt had applied for time to observe the comet with the Hubble Space Telescope in April and June 2022. But by February, the comet had already disintegrated. “That was a wake-up call,” Jewitt says.</p>



<p>So Jewitt turned to historical observations of long-period comets that came close to the sun since the year 2000. He selected those whose water vapor production had been indirectly measured via an instrument called <a href="http://swan.projet.latmos.ipsl.fr/">SWAN on NASA’s SOHO spacecraft</a>, to see how quickly the comets were losing mass. He also picked out comets whose movements deviating from their orbits around the sun had been measured. Those motions are a result of water vapor jets pushing the comet around, like a spraying hose flopping around a garden.</p>



<p>That left him with 27 comets, seven of which did not survive their closest approach to the sun.</p>



<p>Jewitt expected that the most active comets would disintegrate the fastest, by puffing away all their water. But he found the opposite: It turns out that the least active comets with the smallest dirty snowball cores were the most at risk of falling apart.</p>



<p>“Basically, being a small nucleus near the sun causes you to die,” Jewitt says. “The question is, why?”</p>



<p>It wasn’t that the comets were torn apart by the sun’s gravity — they didn’t get close enough for that. And simply sublimating until they went poof would have been too slow a death to match the observations. The comets are also unlikely to collide with anything else in the vastness of space and break apart that way. And a previous suggestion that pressure builds up inside the comets until they explode like a hand grenade doesn’t make sense to Jewitt. Comets’ upper few centimeters of material would absorb most of the sun’s heat, he says, so it would be difficult to heat the center of the comet enough for that to work.</p>



<p>The best remaining explanation, Jewitt says, is rotational breakup. As the comet nears the sun and its water heats up enough to sublimate, jets of water vapor form and make the core start to spin like a catherine wheel firework. Smaller cores are easier to push around than a larger one, so they spin more easily.</p>



<p>“It just spins faster and faster, until it doesn’t have enough tensile strength to hold together,” Jewitt says. “I’m pretty sure that’s what’s happening.”</p>



<p>That deadly spin speed is actually quite slow. Spinning at about half a meter per second could spell curtains for a kilometer-sized comet, he calculates. “You can walk faster.”</p>



<p>But comets are fragile. If you held a fist-sized comet in front of your face, a sneeze would destroy it, says planetary astronomer Nalin Samarasinha of the Planetary Science Institute in Tucson, who was not involved in the study.</p>



<p>Samarasinha thinks Jewitt’s proposal is convincing. “Even though the sample size is small, I think it is something really happening.” But other things might be destroying these comets too, he says, and Jewitt agrees.</p>



<p>Samarasinha is holding out for more comet observations, which could come when the <a href="https://www.lsst.org/">Vera Rubin Observatory</a> begins surveying the sky in 2023. Jewitt’s idea “is something which can be observationally tested in a decade or two.”</p>

                <p>The first recorded case of a person passing monkeypox to a dog could be a harbinger of other animals catching the sometimes disfiguring and deadly virus. If that happens, monkeypox could establish animal reservoirs outside of Africa for the first time.</p>



<p>Two men in France appear to have <a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(22)01487-8/fulltext#%20">spread monkeypox to their Italian greyhound</a>, researchers report August 10 in the <em>Lancet</em>. The men reported letting the dog sleep in bed with them.</p>



<p>Monkeypox can spread through skin-to-skin contact, such as the intimate contact that happens during sex. Even more casual contact such as <a href="https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/28/10/22-1191_article">dancing in close confines</a> can spread the virus, an Aug. 15 study in <em>Emerging Infectious Diseases</em> suggests. So can contact with objects an infected person has used, including bedding and clothing. Infectious monkeypox viruses <a href="https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/28/10/22-1047_article">linger more often on such soft, porous materials</a> than on hard surfaces, researchers report August 11 in <em>Emerging Infectious Diseases</em>. Some 60 percent of soft goods and 5 percent of hard surfaces tested still carried viable virus for at least 15 days, the team found. &nbsp;</p>





<p>In the case of the dog, the animal developed pustules about 12 days after its owners reported symptoms. Viral DNA from one of the men matched that from the dog, suggesting that the human had given monkeypox to an animal.</p>



<p>Usually monkeypox goes the other way, from animals — especially rodents in some parts of Africa — to people in “spillover,” or zoonotic, infections. “This is a classic case of reverse zoonoses,” or spillback, in which a viral disease hops from humans back into animals, says Grant McFadden, a pox virologist at Arizona State University in Tempe.</p>



<p>Such spillback events are fairly common with other viruses; people are known to have given COVID-19 to <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coronavirus-dog-pet-hong-kong-infection">dogs</a>, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/cats-animals-pets-coronavirus-covid19">cats</a> and zoo animals, for instance (<em>SN: 3/5/20; SN: 3/31/20</em>). Some pox viruses, including cowpox, can infect a wide range of species, while others like smallpox and a rabbit pox virus called myxoma virus can infect only one or a few species.</p>



<p>How widely monkeypox can spread among nonrodent animal species isn’t known. Researchers have documented that the virus can infect 51 species, including <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/poxvirus/monkeypox/veterinarian/monkeypox-in-animals.html#table">apes and monkeys</a>, and other animals including <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7823380/">anteaters, porcupines and opossums</a>.</p>



<p>Right now, monkeypox is endemic in some parts of Africa. But some scientists worry that the global outbreak, which has <a href="https://extranet.who.int/publicemergency">infected more than 36,000 people</a> so far, creates more chances for the virus to jump from humans to animals. If that happens, the virus could become established in animal populations around the world, setting up new reservoirs that could cause repeated infections in humans and animals.</p>



<p>Preliminary research suggests that monkeypox may be able to <a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.08.13.503846v1?ct=">infect two to four times more species</a> than previously thought, researchers from the University of Liverpool in England report August 15 in a preprint on bioRxiv.org. The team used machine learning trained to consider the genetic makeup of the virus, the number of species of animals in a genus known to be infected by pox viruses, diet composition of potential hosts, where the animals live and other factors that could contribute to a species becoming a new host for monkeypox, says virologist Marcus Blagrove.</p>



<p>About 80 percent of the potential new hosts for monkeypox are rodents or primates, the researchers predict. But domestic animals like dogs and cats were also predicted to be susceptible to infection. The researchers didn’t know about the case of the dog in France when they made the prediction, Blagrove says, so the report of the canine infection “was a quite nice validation that the method works.”</p>



<p>Red foxes and brown rats are two potential monkeypox hosts that the researchers say are particularly worrisome. Foxes (<em>Vulpes vulpes</em>) scavenge from garbage, which could bring them in contact with monkeypox-contaminated items. Brown rats (<em>Rattus norvegicus</em>) are already known hosts for cowpox. They are common in sewers in Europe and could get infected through feces containing monkeypox. Though the study emphasized the risk in Europe, where more than half the monkeypox cases in people in the current outbreak have been reported, the findings could be applicable more widely. Brown rats are found on <a href="https://animaldiversity.org/accounts/Rattus_norvegicus/">every continent except Antarctica</a>. Red <a href="https://animaldiversity.org/accounts/Vulpes_vulpes/">foxes roam much of the Northern Hemisphere</a>, including North and Central America, Europe, Northern Africa and parts of Asia.</p>

<p>The study also names three European rodents that could become reservoir species. The herb field mouse (<em>Apodemus uralensis</em>), yellow-necked field mouse (<em>Apodemus flavicollis</em>) and Alpine marmot (<em>Marmota marmota</em>) all have pockets of big populations that could be ideal for passing the virus around.</p>



<p>“These are examples of wild animals that might be a reservoir. We can’t say for certain, but they might be susceptible,” Blagrove says. Those species along with foxes and brown rats should be regularly surveyed for monkeypox to prevent new reservoirs from being established, he says.</p>



<p>But just because an animal can get infected with monkeypox doesn’t mean they can pass it on. “There is a difference between accidental hosts and a reservoir,” says Giliane de Souza Trindade, a pox virologist at the Federal University of Minas Gerais in Brazil. Accidental hosts are often dead ends for the virus. A true reservoir species must be able to pass the virus from animal to animal, and then sometimes to humans they encounter. &nbsp;</p>

<p>If dogs can easily get monkeypox, they may be able to pass it to humans, other dogs or other animals through feces or saliva, Trindade says. Domestic animals that live with people who get monkeypox should be isolated from sick people and from other animals outside the home, she says.</p>



<p>Trindade and her colleagues are preparing to study pets of people who have monkeypox to see whether the virus passes easily to cats and dogs, she says. But she is more worried about live animal markets. “Animals are in cages very close together and people are passing by all the time.” Such settings are ripe for transmitting viruses between species. The COVID-19 pandemic probably got its <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.abp8715">start at a live animal market</a> in Wuhan, China, researchers reported July 26 in <em>Science</em>. &nbsp;</p>



<p>McFadden stresses that the dog’s case is still an isolated report. “We don’t know is this a rare thing or have we just not paid attention to it?” For now, he says, efforts should be focused on containing the outbreak among humans. While people with monkeypox should take care not to pass the virus to their pets, this case shouldn’t cause undue worry, he says. “We’re not at the panic button stage just yet.”</p>



<p>Scientists are also still learning how monkeypox spreads among people. Some people may <a href="https://www.acpjournals.org/doi/10.7326/M22-2183">have monkeypox, but not develop symptoms</a>, researchers report August 16 in the <em>Annals of Internal Medicine</em>. It’s not known whether asymptomatic people can transmit the virus to others, but if they can, vaccinating close contacts of symptomatic people may not be enough to contain the outbreak, the researchers warn.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/proton-charm-quark-up-down-particle-physics">Protons contain intrinsic charm quarks, a new study suggests</a></h4>

              
                <p>Protons may be intrinsically charming.</p>



<p>The subatomic particles are a mash-up of three lighter particles called quarks: two of the type known as up quarks and one down quark. But physicists have speculated for decades that protons may also host more massive quarks, called “intrinsic” charm quarks. A new analysis <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-022-04998-2">supports that idea</a>, physicists report in the Aug. 18 <em>Nature</em>.</p>



<p>Charm quarks are much heavier than up or down quarks. So heavy that, mind-bendingly, “you can have a component of the proton which is heavier than the proton itself,” says theoretical physicist Juan Rojo of Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam.</p>





<p>Rojo and colleagues combined a variety of experimental results and theoretical calculations in hopes of unveiling the proton’s hypothetical charm. Measuring this feature is key to fully understanding one of the most important particles in the universe, Rojo says.</p>



<p>Physicists know that the more deeply you probe a proton, the more complicated it appears. When observed at very high energies, as in collisions at particle accelerators like the Large Hadron Collider, or LHC, near Geneva, protons contain a <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/theres-still-lot-we-dont-know-about-proton">motley crew</a> of transient quarks and their antimatter counterparts, antiquarks (<em>SN: 4/18/17</em>). Such “extrinsic” quarks are created when gluons, particles that help “glue” the quarks together inside protons, split into quark-antiquark pairs.</p>



<p>Extrinsic quarks aren’t fundamental to the identity of the proton. They’re simply a result of how gluons behave at high energies. But charm quarks might exist inside protons even at low energies, in a more persistent, deep-seated form.</p>



<p>In quantum physics, particles don’t take on a definite state until they’re measured — they are instead described by probabilities. If protons contain intrinsic charm, there’d be a small probability to find within a proton not only two up quarks and a down quark, but also a charm quark and antiquark. Since protons aren’t well-defined collections of individual particles, a <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/proton-mass-quarks-calculation">proton’s mass</a> isn’t a simple sum of its parts (<em>SN: 11/26/18</em>). The small probability means that the full mass of the charm quark and antiquark isn’t added to the proton’s heft, explaining how the proton may contain particles heavier than itself.</p>



<p>Using thousands of measurements from experiments at the LHC and other particle accelerators, combined with theoretical calculations, the team found evidence for intrinsic charm in the proton at a statistical level called 3 sigma. The intrinsic charm quarks carry about 0.6 percent of a proton’s momentum, the researchers report.</p>



<p>But 5 sigma is typically required for a conclusive result. “The data and analysis are not yet sufficient &#8230; to get from ‘evidence for’ to ‘discovery of’ intrinsic charm,” says Ramona Vogt, a theoretical physicist at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory in California who wrote a perspective piece on the study for <em>Nature</em>.</p>



<p>What’s more, defining what is meant by “intrinsic charm” isn’t straightforward, muddling the comparison of the new finding with earlier results from different groups. “Previous studies have found different limits on intrinsic charm partly because they have used different definitions and schemes,” says theoretical physicist Wally Melnitchouk of Jefferson Lab in Newport News, Va.</p>



<p>Notably, the new analysis incorporates results from the LHCb collaboration, which <a href="https://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.128.082001">reported measurements potentially consistent</a> with intrinsic charm in the proton in the Feb. 25 <em>Physical Review Letters</em>. Including that data in the analysis is “what’s really new,” says theoretical physicist C.-P. Yuan of Michigan State University in East Lansing. But Yuan has reservations about the type of calculation used to interpret the data. “It’s not done at what we today call the state-of-art analysis.”</p>



<p>Scientists need to pin down the proton’s intrinsic charm content to better understand results at the LHC and other facilities that smash protons together and observe what comes out. Researchers have to be able to gauge the ins and outs of the objects they’re colliding.</p>



<p>Data from future accelerators such as the planned Electron-Ion Collider could help, says theoretical physicist Tim Hobbs of Fermilab in Batavia, Ill. For now, the proton remains mysterious. “The problem is still with us; it remains very challenging.”</p>

                <p> PLOS Note: we use this blog, on occasion, to highlight authors and their research. Today, we are shining a spotlight on this <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0272730">work </a>that was published last week on PLOS ONE. The topic is dear to our heart. The author of the blog and the paper is Marc-Andre Simard. He is a Ph.D. student in information science at the University of Montr&eacute;al who works on open science and science policy.</p>



<p>The COVID-19 pandemic has heightened the importance of faster and more efficient dissemination of scholarly literature. Early in the pandemic, several publishers, such as Springer-Nature, the American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS) and Elsevier, announced the opening of their COVID-19-related papers. However, it remains unclear if these papers will remain free to access for researchers and the public. For instance, Elsevier <a href="https://www.elsevier.com/connect/coronavirus-information-center">mentioned</a> that their Novel Coronavirus Information Center will be available &ldquo;as long as necessary,&rdquo; hinting that these resources might be locked behind a paywall one day.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>The movement toward open access</strong></p>



<p>The scientific community has long advocated for free and unrestricted access to scholarly literature. This movement toward <em>open access</em> was formalized through 2002&rsquo;s <a href="https://www.budapestopenaccessinitiative.org/read/">Budapest Open Access Initiative</a>. The idea behind the open access (OA) movement is that science is a public good that should be made available to everyone in order to remove some of the technological and financial barriers to science and accelerate research and education across the planet. Over the past 20 years, several major initiatives have been developed worldwide to support open access dissemination. These include <a href="https://en.unesco.org/science-sustainable-future/open-science/recommendation">UNESCO&rsquo;s Recommendation on Open Science</a> and <a href="https://www.coalition-s.org/why-plan-s/">Plan S</a>, a European initiative that aims to make research articles supported by public funds freely available online, without embargo, and with transparent pricing.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Just how big is open access?</strong></p>



<p>Using the <a href="https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/basic-search">Web of Science</a>, a database that indexes publication and citation data from about 13,000 journals annually, and <a href="https://unpaywall.org/">Unpaywall</a>, an open database tracking open access content from over 50,000 scientific publishers and repositories, we have collected a dataset of 8,137,675 documents that were published between 2015 and 2019. We found that over 40% of all scientific publications indexed in the Web of Science during that period were available in OA at the time of our data collection, with shares ranging from 21% in humanities to 50% in medical and health sciences (Figure&nbsp;1).</p>

<p><strong>Does open access really matter for lower income countries?</strong></p>



<p>Scientific publishing is a lucrative business. Since the early 2000s, <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0127502">more than half of scientific papers have been published by the so-called &ldquo;oligopoly of publishers&rdquo;</a> that <a href="https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg24032052-900-time-to-break-academic-publishings-stranglehold-on-research/#:~:text=The%20answer%20is%20academic%20publishing,up%20and%20judge%20its%20merits.">have been making record profits</a>. Participating in science is also expensive: in order to have access to the latest scientific discoveries, it is often necessary to pay journal subscription fees that are so high that even <a href="https://sparcopen.org/our-work/big-deal-cancellation-tracking/">some of the wealthiest universities in the world have decided to unsubscribe from them</a>. Low-income and developing countries are particularly vulnerable to these pricing dynamics.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Using the <a href="https://blogs.worldbank.org/opendata/new-world-bank-country-classifications-income-level-2021-2022">World Bank&rsquo;s country classification by income</a> and author affiliation data from the Web of Science, we have looked into the relationship between income level and 1) open access publishing and 2) references made to open access literature. Figures&nbsp;2 and 3 illustrate OA publications and references of countries compared to the world average. Our data show that low-income and lower-middle-income countries, especially in Sub-Saharan Africa, tend to publish and use open access literature more than the rest of the world. However, upper-middle-income countries use open access literature less than the rest of the world, while open access practices vary greatly in high-income countries.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Those findings show that countries in sub-Saharan Africa publish and cite open access literature at a higher rate than the rest of the world. At the same time, we found that the Middle East and Asia are the areas where both their proportion of OA publications and of OA use is lower. This could be explained by the fact that most publishers provide publication fee waivers for low-income countries but not or only partially for middle-income countries. Ultimately, our study highlights national differences in open access uptake and leads us to believe that more open access initiatives at the institutional, national, and international levels are needed to support the broader adoption of open scholarship.</p>

<p><a href="https://bookshop.org/a/21798/9780063086906">A Portrait of the Scientist as a Young Woman</a><br><em>Lindy Elkins-Tanton</em><br><em>William Morrow, $29.99</em></p>
</div>



<p>Becoming an astronomer might seem straightforward. An awe of the night sky sparks a child to someday study astronomy in school, eventually leading to a graduate degree and a job in the field. But as two new books make clear, few women find the road so simple.</p>



<p>In <em>A Portrait of the Scientist as a Young Woman</em>, Lindy Elkins-Tanton, a geologist turned planetary scientist, recounts her struggles with depression and anxiety as a child and with the sexism she faced early in her career. In one example, she and colleagues (all men but one) were collecting rock samples in Siberia, searching for evidence of a connection between volcanic eruptions and past extinction events. Taking her time to set her chisel at just the right spot to break the rock, Elkins-Tanton could “practically smell the silent impatience from the men nearby,” she writes. “Yes, they could have done it faster, and with fewer blows. But why should that be the important metric? Why is it not more important to let each person do the tasks they want and need to do, at their own pace?”</p>





<p>Her male colleagues’ implicit and explicit bias against women in science, she writes, fanned her own self-doubt. To demand the same respect as male scientists, she learned she had to insist, gently, to carry her own baggage and take her own samples, her way and on her time. The lessons she learned in Siberia and in the lab, she writes, helped her develop a compassionate and just leadership style as the director of Arizona State University’s School of Earth and Space Exploration and as the head of <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/press-release/nasa-announces-launch-delay-for-psyche-asteroid-mission">NASA’s upcoming Psyche mission</a>. That mission will send a spacecraft to probe a metal-rich asteroid to better understand Earth’s iron-rich core.</p>



<p>Every scientist’s experience is unique, but elements of Elkins-Tanton’s story, particularly the sexism in science, find voice throughout <em>The Sky Is for Everyone: Women Astronomers in Their Own Words</em>. Edited by astronomer Virginia Trimble and author David Weintraub, this anthology of 37 short autobiographies covers more than six decades of astronomy and shows the varied paths of female astronomers and the roadblocks that can slow or sideline their success.</p>

<p><a href="https://bookshop.org/a/21798/9780691207100">The Sky Is for Everyone</a><br><em>Virginia Trimble and David A. Weintraub (eds.)</em><br>Princeton Univ., $29.95</p>
</div>



<p>Astrophysicist France Córdova, for instance, opens her story with an evocative description of the time she spent in the summer of 1968 in a pueblo near Oaxaca City, Mexico, working on a cultural anthropology project. She had planned to study anthropology in graduate school, but after watching a TV show on dead stars, she realized she “had a deeper wanderlust inside,” she writes, “to connect with something wider, deeper than I could imagine — the stars and the Universe that held them.”</p>



<p>As a child, Córdova hadn’t known anyone who believed women could be scientists. Her parents thought finding a husband should be her college goal. Instead, she chose to pursue a graduate degree in astrophysics. She launched a career in X-ray astronomy and then pivoted again to policy and leadership, assuming the role of NASA’s chief scientist and later head of the National Science Foundation — positions where, she writes, she could advocate more effectively for women in science.</p>



<p>Dara Norman, in contrast, never questioned that she’d become an astronomer; by age 10 she was certain. She earned a Ph.D. in 1999 after studying bias in the measurements of distant galaxies that can distort our understanding of the universe. To her, the similarities between biases in scientific data and biases in the culture of science were blatant. “I am amazed that as scientists we understand the idea of bias in our data and methods…. We work tirelessly to identify such biases … and eliminate that bias,” she writes. “However, when confronted with bias in our profession … many of us continue to deny the existence of the issue.”</p>





<p>Norman realized the traditional path of an astronomer wasn’t for her. The joy of doing research was overshadowed by the negative experiences she endured “as a Black American woman just trying to <em>be</em> a scientist.” Like Córdova, she now works to improve the culture of science, at the National Optical-Infrared Astronomy Research Lab in Tucson.</p>



<p>That culture is changing, slowly. Before 1990, fewer than 40 women held full-time positions in astronomy or astrophysics at North American universities. Now, the number is high enough that it’s not as easy to track how many women successfully pursue a career in the field, Trimble and Weintraub note. Although those numbers point to progress, both books remind readers that blatant and subtle acts of sexism are still present and that careers in science can still be precarious for women. And yet women persist, perhaps, as Elkins-Tanton writes, driven by the “realization that we are only a tiny part of a vast unexplored universe.” If true, it’s a pillar of resilience to aspire to.</p>

                <p>In a new study from <em>PLOS Climate</em> authors Laura Niggli at University of Zurich, Switzerland and colleagues have found that the cascading effects of extreme weather &ndash; such as recent heat waves which combine heat and drought &ndash; and the interconnectedness of critical services and sectors has the potential to destabilize socioeconomic systems. Learn on to learn more about the researchers&rsquo; findings below or visit <em>PLOS Climate</em> to access the <a href="https://journals.plos.org/climate/article?id=10.1371/journal.pclm.0000057" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">full article</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Background</strong></p>



<p>Over the past several decades, the frequency and magnitude of concurrent climate extremes, such as heat and drought events, have increased. These events can affect many different assets, sectors and systems of the human environment, including human security, health, and well-being, although many risk assessments and resilience plans only consider individual events.</p>



<p><strong>Study Design</strong></p>



<p>To better understand how extreme weather might affect interlinked socioeconomic systems, the authors of the present study conducted a qualitative network-type analysis, first reviewing studies of eight historical concurrent heat and drought extreme events in Europe, Africa and Australia. Next, they compiled examples of interlinked impacts on several critical services and sectors, including human health, transport, agriculture and food production, and energy. For example, drought events reduced river navigation options, limiting the transport of critical goods. Rail transport was simultaneously stymied when prolonged heat buckled the tracks. Using these analyses, researchers created visualizations of the interconnected effects of concurrent heat and drought events on those services and sectors.</p>

<p>The researchers found the most important cascading processes and interlinkages centered around the health, energy and agriculture and food production sectors. In some instances, response measures for one sector had negative effects on other sectors. Future research should focus on response measures in interconnected systems to improve the resilience to compound heat and drought events.</p>



<p>According to the authors, &ldquo;We identified an interconnected web of sectors that interact and cause additional losses and damages in several other sectors. This multilevel interconnectedness makes the risks of compound extreme events so complex and critical. More efforts should be concentrated on the analysis of such cascading risks and on strategies to interrupt such chains of impacts, rather than compartmentalizing risk assessment into single extreme events, impacts and sectors&rdquo;.</p>



<p>Author Laura Niggli adds: &ldquo;This study presents unprecedented quantitative information and qualitative understanding on the impacts of combined heat and drought events in major world regions over the past 20 years. It contributes new insights into how these impacts cascade through critical systems (health, energy, food production, etc.) and emphasizes the importance to appropriately consider such impact cascades in adaptation efforts.&rdquo;</p>

                <img width="140" height="110" src="https://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcseriesblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2022/08/pexels-pixabay-220213-140x110.jpg" class="attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image" alt="" style="display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear:both;" /><p><strong>A participatory method</strong></p>
<p>Ripple Effects Mapping, or REM, is a participatory and qualitative form of impact evaluation. When we learned of this method, we thought that it would be invaluable in helping understand some of the complex public health interventions we were evaluating – particularly the elements that were deemed hard-to-measure. However, to make it more suited to our needs, we adapted it further. It is this adapted method that we talk more about here.</p>
<p>One fundamental aspect of REM is that it is participatory. This means that the people who are involved in the design or delivery of an intervention, and those who are affected by it, are invited to participate in data collection workshops. These workshops are qualitative in nature, and so we aim to build up a collective picture of what happened during the life-course of an intervention.</p>
<p><strong>Running a REM workshop</strong></p>
<p>Workshops are usually split into five main sections. The <span style="font-style: normal !msorm"><em>first </em></span><em>section</em> gives everyone time to speak with each other; to discuss how they have been involved in the intervention, what they are proud of, and what impacts have been important to them. This is predominantly a warm-up activity.</p>
<p>The <span style="font-style: normal !msorm"><em>second and third</em></span> <span style="font-style: normal !msorm"><em>sections</em></span> are perhaps the most important. Small groups of 4-6 people are formed, and groups are asked to start writing down and discussing what they were involved in and what the impacts have been. They capture this on flip chart paper which has a timeline in its centre (e.g. Figure 1). A facilitator can guide participants through the activity by asking probing questions. They also make sure that everyone has an equal opportunity to contribute to the activities.</p>
<p>One of the adaptations we made was that REM is viewed as both a retrospective and prospective method. In the workshops, participants can map their activities and impacts over the previous 3-6 months, and they can also anticipate what they envisage will happen over the next 3-6 months. Follow up workshops can then be carried out 3-6 months later where they revisit the previous REM outputs and ask, &#8220;Did what we think was going to happen, happen?&#8221; We also recommend that the first REM workshop is delivered in the first 3-6 months of their work.</p>
<p>The <span style="font-style: normal !msorm"><em>fourth section</em></span> is a reflective one. Now that activities and impacts are visualised, the facilitator can ask participants to reflect on what they deem to be the most significant and why. But often, a more interesting conversation happens around the least significant impacts. Where did they invest time and energy which didn’t lead to anything meaningful? Why did this happen? What could be done in the future to minimise this happening again? Were other factors at play which prevented their work being impactful? Some of this can also be added to the map, or it could be audio-recorded and analysed later.</p>
<p>The <span style="font-style: normal !msorm"><em>last section</em></span> of the workshop is also reflective. REM is not only an evaluative tool but also one which can drive continuous intervention improvement. So here, the facilitator can get the group to discuss what they will do next because of attending the REM workshop. It might be that some participants didn’t previously know of each other, and merely being in the workshop created the opportunity for new collaborations.</p>
<p>Workshops usually require a couple of hours. If you have less time, then elements of the workshop can be shortened. The follow up workshops can be shorter too as participants become more familiar with the method. We’ve tested the adapted method in online and in-person formats. Both can work, and each has pros and cons, but the in-person format probably allows for greater levels of participation and discussion.</p>
<p><strong>Further information</strong></p>
<p>Within the <a href="https://bmcmedresmethodol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12874-022-01570-4">paper</a> and our <a href="https://arc-w.nihr.ac.uk/training-and-capacity-building/arc-west-courses/introduction-to-ripple-effects-mapping/">supplementary online training</a>, we provide further details on how to apply the method, the circumstances in which it may be useful, and perhaps most importantly, we encourage others to adapt the method to meet their own needs. Hopefully, this method, and future iterations of it, offer one means of capturing the realities of efforts to improve public health.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/football-spiral-wobble-frequency-physics">Spiraling footballs wobble at one of two specific frequencies</a></h4>

              
                <p>In American football, some passes are caught and some are dropped — but all wobble as they fly.</p>



<p>Spiraling pigskins tend to <a href="https://asmedigitalcollection.asme.org/openengineering/article/doi/10.1115/1.4054692/1141841/Modeling-the-Dynamics-of-an-American-Football-and">visibly wobble at either a slow or fast frequency</a>, depending on how the ball is thrown, researchers report online June 23 in the <em>ASME Open Journal of Engineering</em>. That wobble, and to a lesser extent Earth’s rotation and the ball’s spin, cause passes to stray sideways — so don’t completely blame the quarterback this upcoming season.</p>





<p>“The fact that [a football] wobbles and the fact that it doesn&#8217;t go straight — those are the two big effects that you see in a pass,” says mechanical engineer John Dzielski of the Stevens Institute of Technology in Hoboken, N.J.</p>



<p>Using physics equations from ballistics studies and data from <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF02859892">wind tunnel experiments with footballs</a>, Dzielski and software engineer Mark Blackburn, also of the Stevens Institute, ran computer simulations of a spiraling football pass.</p>



<p>They found that a pigskin flying at around 27 meters per second with around 600 rotations per minute would visibly wobble either one or five times per second. Wobbling occurs as the ball’s spinning momentum interacts with a twisting force that acts to turn the football’s nose away from the direction of flight. The faster wobble dominates when extra energy is applied during throws by twisting of the wrist or lateral motion of the arm.</p>



<p>That wobbling generates lift that pushes the ball sideways, potentially changing the landing point by several meters, the team reports. Earth’s rotation also could cause a pass to drift several centimeters. And the Magnus effect — whereby a spinning projectile becomes sandwiched by low- and high-pressure zones of air, bending its trajectory — had double that impact.</p>



<p>Dzielski and Blackburn are now interested in refining their simulations by developing an instrument to gather data from footballs in flight.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/asteroid-impacts-created-mars-planetary-sand">Asteroid impacts might have created some of Mars’ sand</a></h4>

              
                <p>Sand on Earth is continuously being created by the slow erosion of rocks. But on Mars, violent asteroid impacts may play an important role in making new sand.</p>



<p>As much as a quarter of Martian sand is composed of spherical bits of glass forged in the intense heat of impacts, a new study shows. Since windblown sand sculpts the Martian landscape, this discovery reveals how <a href="https://www.hou.usra.edu/meetings/metsoc2022/pdf/6526.pdf">asteroid impacts contribute to shaping Mars</a>, even long after the collisions occur, Purdue University planetary scientist Briony Horgan and colleagues suggest. The team will present their results August 18 at the 85th Annual Meeting of the Meteoritical Society in Glasgow, Scotland.</p>





<p>Using data collected by spacecraft orbiting Mars, Horgan and collaborators looked at different wavelengths of visible and infrared light reflected from the planet’s surface to determine the minerals present in Martian sand. The team found signatures of glass all over the planet, particularly at higher latitudes.</p>



<p>One explanation for all that glass is volcanic eruptions, which are known to produce glass when magma mixes with water. But the most glass-rich swath of Mars — the planet’s northern plains — is conspicuously bereft of volcanoes, the researchers note. That rules out volcanic eruptions as the culprit in that location and instead suggests that far more cataclysmic events — asteroid impacts — might be involved.</p>



<p>That’s a plausible argument, says Steven Goderis, a geochemist at the Vrije Universiteit Brussel in Belgium who was not involved in the research. “Often Mars is seen as a volcanic planet. But there’s also a very strong impact component, and this is often overlooked.”</p>



<p>When an asteroid moving at several kilometers per second slams into a rocky planet like Mars, the energy of the event melts nearby rocks and launches them skywards. That molten shrapnel fragments and produces sand grain–sized pieces that are roughly spherical. Those bits of glass — called impact spherules — eventually <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/ancient-meteor-explosion-over-antarctica-impact-rock">rain back onto the planet</a> (<em>SN: 3/31/21</em>).</p>

<p>Over the last 3 billion years, asteroid impacts could have plausibly blanketed the surface of Mars in a layer of impact spherules roughly half a meter thick, Horgan and her colleagues calculate. All that material added to the sand on Mars that formed through normal erosion. “Impacts helped supply sand to the surface continuously over time,” Horgan says.</p>



<p>Scientists might have the opportunity to analyze Martian impact spherules in the future. NASA’s Perseverance rover is <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/nasa-perseverance-rover-mars-rock-sample-space">currently storing samples of Martian sand and rocks</a> for eventual return to Earth (<em>SN: 9/10/21</em>). That’s exciting, Horgan says. “The record of all this is in the sand.”</p>

<p><strong>Please tell us a little bit about what you do at PLOS.</strong></p>

          <p>As part of the Open Research team, I&rsquo;m working to advance the adoption of open science in the research communities that PLOS serves. This work is core to our mission, because we see Open Science adoption as essential to increasing accessibility, trust and collaboration around research that can solve pressing problems. Beyond just publishing the finished product of scientific research on an open access basis, we want to see researchers sharing outputs from <a href="https://plos.org/open-science/">across the entire research cycle</a> as openly as possible.</p>
        </div>
      </div>
    


<p>In some fields sharing early and often is second nature, but in others this takes real reorientation. So my job is to understand the needs that particular research communities have around open science, the challenges they face as well as the assets they bring to the table. From there, my colleagues and I develop solutions that can move the needle on the uptake of open science by PLOS authors&mdash;this could be a policy, a technology, or something else&mdash;and then test their effectiveness to see if these solutions might be relevant elsewhere.</p>



<p><strong>During your time at PLOS, what initiatives have you been involved with that have been driven by curiosity?</strong></p>



<p>One project that I&rsquo;m involved with at the moment is a study of how and why researchers share detailed methods information. There&rsquo;s been very little written about this, relative to other open science practices like data sharing. So, both at PLOS and as we&rsquo;ve discussed this study with other stakeholders, there&rsquo;s a genuine sense of curiosity about an understudied phenomenon; we know that we need to understand the current state of play before we can improve on it.</p>



<p>To develop a research instrument for this study, I conducted exploratory interviews with researchers from a diverse set of backgrounds. I engaged with scholarship from outside the narrow domain of publishing, drawing inspiration from a study of what film studies researcher Salom&eacute; Aguilera Skvirsky calls &ldquo;<a href="https://www.dukeupress.edu/the-process-genre">the process genre</a>.&rdquo; I also worked with colleagues from other teams at PLOS to sharpen the question logic and sampling strategy for the survey I created: like most scientists, I collaborated rather than trying to become an expert in everything.</p>



<p>I&rsquo;m still in the midst of analyzing our results, but whatever we find we intend to share openly. That&rsquo;s one of the things that makes me proud to work at PLOS: even as we use<a href="https://plos.org/research-by-plos/"> the research we conduct</a> to inform our internal decision-making, we also communicate that knowledge back to the research community in order to keep driving discovery forward.</p>



<p><strong>Why do you think this approach is important for science?</strong></p>



<p>Having curiosity guide our work at PLOS is important for at least two reasons. The first is being empirical. Even as evidence piles up about the scientific and societal benefits of openness, the persistence of more closed ways of doing research suggests that advocates need to do more than simply talk louder. For instance, I admire the work that science studies researcher Nicole Nelson has done to show that limited uptake of reproducibility reforms may be about<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-021-03617-w"> more than misaligned incentives</a>. Curiosity means not getting too attached to any one explanation.</p>



<p>The second reason for foregrounding curiosity is being critical. A recent edited collection on the study of curiosity<a href="https://manifold.umn.edu/read/curiosity-studies/section/a782de56-c52a-49d6-941d-ecb0c4f0f015#intro"> opened with questions</a> that have stayed with me: &ldquo;Who can be curious, within what contexts, why, and how? For whom is curiosity valorized?&rdquo; These questions chime with a heightened focus, at PLOS and elsewhere, on equity and inclusion in open science. Against the backdrop of historical disparities that concentrated opportunities for scientific inquiry in the global North, we must ensure that our current efforts open up what counts as legitimate knowledge and avoid stratifying researchers into creators and reusers.</p>



<p><strong>What does it mean to you personally to be involved in work like this?</strong></p>



<p>My own research background is in cultural anthropology, a field whose method is rooted in appreciative curiosity about how people&mdash;<a href="https://www.hup.harvard.edu/catalog.php?isbn=9780674063488">including scientists!</a>&mdash;go about their everyday lives. This personal and professional curiosity still kicks in every time I&rsquo;m talking to a researcher and hear a term used in a way that I don&rsquo;t (yet) understand.</p>



<p>During my PhD, I thought that I would channel this curiosity into a career as a professor. But, in the work I&rsquo;m doing now around open science, I&rsquo;ve found another, no less rewarding way to learn about new communities and to help them realize their aims. It&rsquo;s meaningful for me to be able to tell early-career researchers that you can live out your values off of the tenure track.</p>



<p><strong>By the end of your career, what do you hope people will think about your contribution?</strong></p>



<p>I hope they&rsquo;ll think of me as a boundary crosser, someone who asked big-picture questions that cast problems in a usefully different light. I hope they&rsquo;ll say that I was willing to experiment, to try things that might end up failing and to be transparent about it when they did. I hope they&rsquo;ll see that I left scholarly communication a little weirder, kinder, and more open than I found it.<br></p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/betelgeuse-star-color-rhythm-dimming">Over time, Betelgeuse changed color. Now it’s also lost its rhythm</a></h4>

              
                <p>The star Betelgeuse has always been a diva.</p>



<p>Astronomers from antiquity through the present day have watched the red supergiant pulsing at the shoulder of the constellation Orion, and the star has continually put on a show, two new studies suggest. Betelgeuse may still be recovering from a deep dimming episode a few years ago, one team reports. And the star appears to have put on its reddish stage makeup just 2,000 years ago, before which it wore yellow, another team says.</p>





<p>Together, these studies could tell researchers about how stars spew their guts into space and hint at how long it will be before Betelgeuse explodes in a supernova.</p>



<p>“This star always fools you,” says astronomer Edward Guinan of Villanova University in Pennsylvania, who has studied Betelgeuse for decades and was not involved in the new works. “You think you have it, and all of a sudden, it changes.”</p>



<h4>The “Great Dimming”</h4>



<p>In late 2019, Betelgeuse captured astronomers’ attention when it suddenly grew dark for several months — an event astronomers now call the Great Dimming. Months of subsequent observations led researchers to an explanation: The star had coughed out a big bubble of plasma. That material cooled, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/betelgeuse-star-dim-supernova-death-what-happened">condensed into dust and blocked the star’s face</a> from the perspective of Earth months later (<em>SN: 11/29/20</em>). The surface of the star also <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/betelgeuse-dust-cold-spell-why-giant-star-dimmed">cooled down, contributing to the dimming</a> (<em>SN: 6/16/21</em>).</p>



<p>But what happened next was equally surprising, astrophysicist Andrea Dupree and colleagues report in a paper submitted August 2 to arXiv.org. The star’s regular pulsating brightness, it seems, went <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.01676">completely out of whack</a>.</p>



<p>In its non–Great Dimming life, Betelgeuse’s brightness was on a quasi-periodic dimmer switch. As the star breathed in and out — ballooning out before shrinking back down — its brightness went up and down. “For 200 years, it had a nice, 400-day oscillation in brightness,” says Dupree, of the Harvard &amp; Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics in Cambridge, Mass. “But that’s gone now.”</p>



<p>That regular drumbeat has since grown erratic. Instead of a regular thrum, the oscillations are “like an unbalanced washing machine, going ‘wonka wonka wonka,’” Dupree says.</p>



<p>The wonkiness is a sign of the star struggling to recover from the loss of material in 2019, Dupree says. She calculates that Betelgeuse ejected several times the mass of the moon from its surface, leaving a large cool spot behind. The star’s surface plasma is sloshing around as it returns to equilibrium.</p>



<div class="wp-block-sciencenews-content-sidebar">
<h4>Lost rhythm</h4>



<p>Betelgeuse’s brightness, or stellar magnitude, used to change with a steady, 400-day rhythm (dashed line). But shortly after the Great Dimming in early 2019, the brightness changes became erratic. The different plot symbols and colors denote stellar magnitude measurements from different observatories.</p>

<p>If this picture is correct, it means red supergiants like Betelgeuse can spray material into interstellar space in discrete bursts, rather than a continuous stream. That’s important to know because many of the elements that make up planets and people were formed in stars undergoing what Betelgeuse is going through right now. Studying Betelgeuse’s growing pains and death throes can tell us about our own origins.</p>



<p>But while this picture of Betelgeuse holds together, it is still speculative, Guinan cautions.</p>



<p>One confounding factor is a new set of observations of Betelgeuse during the four-month period when it’s usually out of view. From May through August every year, Betelgeuse is too close to the sun from Earth’s perspective to be seen at night. Usually that leaves a hole in the datasets of astronomers who track its periodic behavior.</p>



<p>But amateur observer Otmar Nickel of Mainz, Germany, developed a technique to measure Betelgeuse’s brightness using <a href="https://app.aavso.org/jaavso/article/3798/">multiple images taken during the day</a>. Dupree’s paper is the first to include those daytime data.</p>



<p>“That’s cool,” Guinan says. “You can follow the star all year round.”</p>



<p>Those extra observations might reveal recurring changes that have always been there, rather than picking up on something truly new. “Those little variations you’re seeing…could easily be present right before the Great Dimming,” Guinan says.</p>



<p>Dupree’s team predicts that the dust Betelgeuse lost could become visible to some telescopes on Earth in 2023. “That would be proof” that the brightness changes were due to a single outburst, Guinan says.</p>



<h4>Seeing yellow</h4>



<p>The Great Dimming isn’t the first time humans have recorded a major change in Betelgeuse’s personality. Two millennia ago, the star <a href="https://academic.oup.com/mnras/advance-article-abstract/doi/10.1093/mnras/stac1969/6651563">was a completely different color</a>, astrophysicist Ralph Neuhäuser and colleagues report in a paper in press in <em>Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society</em>.</p>



<p>The team analyzed ancient descriptions of more than 200 stars whose colors should have been visible to the naked eye in the past few thousand years. Most stars observed over human history had the same color recorded in the past as they display today, the team found. But not Betelgeuse.</p>



<p>The ancient Roman astronomer Gaius Julius Hyginus, who lived from about 64 B.C. to A.D. 17, and is thought to have written the Latin work <em>De Astronomia</em>, described the star in the right shoulder of Orion has having a similar color to Saturn ­— which is yellow. Astrologer and archivist Sima Qian, working during the Chinese Han dynasty around 100 B.C., independently described the star as yellow. Observers from other ancient cultures conspicuously left Betelgeuse out of their lists of red stars.</p>



<p>“I thought, ‘Oh, how can this be?’” says Neuhäuser, of AIU Jena in Germany. “I was not expecting such a result … to find a star to change color in historical time.”</p>



<p>A star’s color is a sign of its <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/star-age-calculation-astronomy-life-cycle">evolutionary stage</a> (<em>SN: 7/23/21</em>). When stars burn through the hydrogen fuel in their cores, they puff up and expel gases into space. That expansion makes their surface temperatures drop, and they change color from blue to red in fairly short order — about 10,000 years for a giant star like Betelgeuse, which is around 14 times as massive as the sun.</p>

</div><figcaption>Measuring a star’s age isn’t as easy as you’d think. Here’s how scientists get their ballpark estimates.</figcaption></figure>



<p>That relatively recent color change suggests Betelgeuse has just reached the end of its hydrogen-burning life and became the red supergiant we know it as today while human observers were watching.</p>



<p>“It’s fully consistent with astrophysical knowledge,” Neuhäuser says. “It could have been expected, but no one really checked.”</p>



<p>That result means anyone waiting for Betelgeuse to go supernova will have a very long wait. If the star just became a supergiant in the last few millennia, it has more than 1 million years to go before the boom.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/w-boson-www-event-particle-physics-large-hadron-collider">Physicists spotted rare W boson trios at the Large Hadron Collider</a></h4>

              
                <p>The letters “www” are typically followed by a “dot” — but not in this experiment.</p>



<p>Around 270 WWW events, <a href="https://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.129.061803">trios of particles called W bosons</a>, appeared in an experiment at the world&#8217;s largest particle collider, researchers report in the Aug. 5 <em>Physical Review Letters</em>. By measuring how often W boson triplets appear in such experiments, physicists can check their foundational theory of particle physics — the standard model — for any cracks.</p>



<p>To produce the rare boson triplets, scientists smashed protons together at the ATLAS experiment at the Large Hadron Collider, or LHC, near Geneva. W bosons are particles that transmit the weak force, which is responsible for certain types of radioactive decay. The particles are mysterious: In April, researchers with the now-concluded CDF experiment at Fermilab in Batavia, Ill., reported that the W boson was <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/w-boson-particle-mass-standard-model-physics">more massive than predicted</a>, hinting that something may be amiss with the standard model (<em>SN: 4/7/22</em>).</p>





<p>In the new study, the probability of a WWW appearance was slightly higher than predicted by the standard model, the team found, though not enough for scientists to declare the theory flawed. “We need to accumulate more data to see how this evolves,” says ATLAS spokesperson and physicist Andreas Hoecker of CERN, the particle physics lab that is the home of the LHC.</p>



<p>Those proton collisions, which reached an energy of 13 trillion electron volts, occurred before the LHC shut down for upgrades in 2018. In July, the <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/large-hadron-collider-restart-upgrades">LHC restarted</a> at a higher energy of 13.6 trillion electron volts (<em>SN: 4/22/22</em>). New data could help nail down whether these threes of a kind really do misbehave.</p>



<p>The WWW discovery is fitting — in 1989, computer scientist Tim Berners-Lee invented the World Wide Web while working at CERN.</p>

                Should publishers acknowledge the work of sleuths when their work has led to retractions? We were prompted to pose the question by a recent retraction from International Environmental Agreements: Politics, Law and Economics of a 2021 paper. The notice reads: The Editor-in-Chief has retracted this article because it shows evidence of peer review manipulation.
