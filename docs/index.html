<p>It is better to ask a student to see if they can explain something to themselves, than for a teacher or book to always explain it to them. That’s according to a new meta-analysis of the findings from 64 prior studies involving nearly 6000 participants that compared learning outcomes from prompted self-explanation compared to instructor explanation, or compared to time spent using other study techniques such as taking notes, summarising, thinking out loud (without the reflection and elaboration involved in self-explanation), or solving more problems.</p>
<p>The authors of the meta-analysis, <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs10648-018-9434-x">published recently in </a><a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs10648-018-9434-x"><em>Educational Psychology Review</em></a>, say that self-explanation is a powerful learning strategy because learners “generate inferences about causal connections and conceptual relationships that enhance understanding”. The process of self-explanation also helps the learner realise what they don’t know, “to fill in missing information, monitor understanding, and modify fusions of new information with prior knowledge when discrepancies or deficiencies are detected”.</p>
<p><span id="more-35529"></span></p>
<p>Past research already established that more effective learners are more inclined to self-explain spontaneously. The meta-analysis confirms that, importantly, prompted self-explanation is also beneficial. Overall, Kiran Bisra and her team at Simon Fraser University found that when students are prompted to self-explain (usually this is in written form, though a few studies involved spoken self-explanation) this improves their learning outcomes with an average effect size of 0.55 (using Hedge’s g), which in a learning context is impressive – “a potentially powerful” intervention in the authors’ words, similar in effectiveness to “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mastery_learning">mastery learning</a>” and “peer tutoring”.</p>
<p>Self-explanation was more effective than instructor explanation (explanation given by a teacher or teaching materials), but instructor explanation was better than no explanation, which suggests that part of the benefit of self-explanation comes from the content (which could be provided elsewhere) while a second aspect comes from the unique process of generating an explanation oneself (prompting the student to recognise links between the knowledge or skills they’ve learned, and allowing them to identity and address gaps in their understanding).</p>
<p>The researchers checked and the benefits of self-explanation are not due to the technique simply leading to more time being spent in study, though the researchers said more investigations do need to do a better job of controlling for this confound.</p>
<p>The researchers also looked to see if any particular aspects of the practice of self-explanation make a difference to its effectiveness. They found some limited evidence that a multiple-choice format (in which the student chooses a range of explanations from a list) to be the least effective, perhaps because it lacks the self-generated elaboration that is usually involved in more open-ended self-explanation.</p>
<p>On this last point, the researchers suggested that the ideal degree of guidance and prompting (such as whether learners are cued to self-explain specific concepts or left to choose) may depend on their proficiency: as students develop their knowledge and skill, the more freedom to choose what and how they self-explain, the better.</p>
<p>Regarding other factors – such as, the timing of the self-explanation in the learning process; the kind of self-explanation that was elicited (such as justifying an argument or explaining a concept); the nature of the to-be-learned material; the subject matter; and how knowledge was subsequently tested – the researchers found little evidence that any of this made much difference to the benefit of self-explanation. One exception was that it was generally less effective when students were asked to self-explain their own state of knowledge and understanding (a form of so-called “meta-cognitive explanation”), which is logical because this would not involve the student elaborating on and forming connections among the to-be-learned material.</p>
<p>Bisra and her colleagues said that a “major implication” of their findings was that “…beneficial effects of inducing self-explanation seem to be available for most subject areas studied in school, and for both conceptual (declarative) and procedural knowledge.”</p>
<p>The results of this meta-analysis provide an encouraging and straightforward take-away for learners and teachers alike. Just one gripe: I would have liked to see more detailed discussion of the exact kinds of other study technique that self-explanation was compared against, to better identify any unique “ingredients” that make self-explanation apparently so effective. In fairness, Bisra and her colleagues recognise this knowledge gap, concluding: “There is now a need for clearer mapping of the unique cognitive benefits self-explanation may promote, the specific effects of different types of self-explanations and prompts, and how self-explanation might be optimally combined and sequenced with other instructional features such as extended practice, explanation modeling, and inquiry-based learning.”</p>

                <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/~r/plos/Blog/~3/1TrU_KhUgDU/">PLOS Authors Say “Yes” to Preprints</a></h4>

<img alt="" class="webfeedsFeaturedVisual wp-post-image" height="150" src="https://blogs.plos.org/plos/files/2018/04/Power-to-the-Preprint_blog-image-002-150x150.png" style="display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear: both;" width="150" /><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We’ve surpassed 1,300 preprint posts to bioRxiv!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is an incredible milestone for us and for all of our authors who chose to opt-in to our preprint service since we </span><a href="https://blogs.plos.org/plos/2018/05/power-to-the-preprint/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">announced </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">our partnership with Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory’s bioRxiv six months ago. We wanted to bring an easy preprint-posting option directly to the submission process for our authors and are thoroughly excited with the results we’ve seen so far. </span></p>
<h3>The road to preprints</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As we began this journey, about 4% of our authors reported that they had posted their submission to a preprint server. While this base remains consistent, our preprint-posting service has built upon it to offer authors more choices. In the past six months we’ve seen an additional 14% opt-in to have PLOS post a preprint on their behalf, indicating that 18% of our authors want to use preprints to share their research. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Of course, the opt-in rate varies by discipline. On </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">PLOS Computational Biology </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">46% of our authors choose to make a preprint of their manuscript available, with half of those posting before submission and the other half requesting PLOS post to bioRxiv on their behalf. In biology in general, the adoption is high. </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">PLOS Biology</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which joined the service later, is already showing a promising trend towards preprints by 39% of our authors (23% of which elect to have PLOS post on their behalf). </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Every opt-in we get is screened by editorial staff before posting to ensure the article fits bioRxiv’s scope and that no sensitive information is accidentally shared. We have also taken a conservative approach and avoided posting research that could have an impact on human health before the claims have been peer reviewed, which is why we do not yet offer to post preprints for <em>PLOS Medicine</em> authors. We’re working in partnership with bioRxiv to refine the posting criteria as we learn more about the needs for early sharing in different communities. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Overall, the openness to new research outputs we’ve seen among our community of authors is inspiring and we hope to see preprint adoption grow even more over the coming year.  </span></p>

<h3></h3>
<h3>Author choice</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We like preprints because they put </span><b>your</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> research first. We’re making it easier for you to choose preprints as a way to rapidly disseminate your research results, establish priority, accumulate citations for your work, and receive input from your community that may help shape the future of your research.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That said, preprints aren’t for everyone or for every paper which is why authors choose when and how their work becomes available. We’re also listening to our community’s feedback to make our service as inclusive as possible.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Many of our authors still prefer to wait for peer review before making their results public. However, about a fifth of the authors who responded to a survey about why they had opted out said they are unfamiliar with preprints. We’re hoping to change that by offering everything you need to know at </span><a href="https://www.plos.org/preprints"><span style="font-weight: 400;">plos.org/preprints</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. More information about preprints is available on </span><a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">bioRxiv</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> along with their posting guidelines. ASAPbio also offers very useful guidance for preprints, including </span><a href="http://asapbio.org/journal-policies"><span style="font-weight: 400;">preprint policy</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> at other journals which may help clarify any concerns you have about submitting a manuscript after you’ve posted a preprint. </span></p>
<h3>Where we go from here</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We’ll continue learning from our community and sharing more information that helps you make the right decision for your paper. We’re also encouraging other preprint options to authors in areas that don’t fall under bioRxiv’s scope. Both </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">PLOS Genetics</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">PLOS ONE</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> have dedicated Preprint Editors to solicit submissions from various preprint servers and we’re looking at more opportunities. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you’re thinking of posting a preprint for the first time, take advantage of this </span><a href="https://www.plos.org/preprint-checklist"><span style="font-weight: 400;">checklist </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">to get started and review all the </span><a href="https://www.plos.org/why-preprint"><span style="font-weight: 400;">benefits</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> preprints could have for your work.</span></p>

<p>While there’s still a debate about whether we <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/21507740.2018.1425756">have free will or not</a>, most researchers at least agree that we feel as if we do. That perception is often considered to have two elements: a sense of having decided to act – called “volition”; and feeling that that decision was our own – having “agency”.</p>
<p>Now in a <a href="http://www.pnas.org/content/115/42/10792">paper</a> in <i>PNAS, </i>Ryan Darby at Vanderbilt University Medical Center and colleagues have used a new technique – lesion network mapping – to identify for the first time the brain networks that underlie our feelings of volition and for agency. “Together, these networks may underlie our perception of free will, with implications for neuropsychiatric diseases in which these processes are impaired,” the researchers write.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><span id="more-35526"></span></p>
<p>Darby and his colleagues first mapped the locations of lesions (brain damage) in 28 people with impaired volition (including people with akinetic mutism, for example, who seem to have lost the motivation to move or speak) and in 50 people with an impaired sense of agency (such as people with so-called “alien-hand syndrome” who feel that they are not in control of their own limb movements).<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Then they looked at which other regions in the brain these various damaged locations typically communicate with (for this they referred to a connectivity map based on scans of 1000 healthy people), to investigate whether or not they all form part of the same network.</p>
<p>For the patients with disordered volition, while their lesions were in different locations in the brain, all 28 were part of a single brain network that connected to the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), a part of the brain already understood by neuroscientists to be involved in the motivation, planning and control of voluntary movements.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Meanwhile, for the people whose brain lesions were causing disordered agency, again, “while the lesions themselves were spatially diverse, mapping showed that… 90 per cent fell within a single brain network defined by functional connectivity to the precuneus cortex,” the researchers write. The precuneus has previously been shown to play a role in having a sense of agency.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>The researchers also looked at lesion connectivity in people with partial paralysis but who retained a sense of volition, and people who made involuntary movements but who continued to feel that they were responsible for these movements (so who had a sense of agency). And they considered the results of studies that have found free will perception can be altered by either electrical or magnetic brain stimulation to particular regions. The results of both types of study supported their identification of the ACC-connected network and the precuneus-connected network as being related to volition and to agency, respectively.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Next, the researchers looked at brain imaging studies of people with psychiatric disorders that have been conceptualised – at least by some researchers – as disorders of free will (affecting volition, agency or both). This includes patients with catatonia, who don’t move or respond though they look to be awake, and cases of psychogenic non-epileptic seizures (PNES), which resemble epileptic seizures, but which do not involve the characteristic electrical discharges in the brain. Though these patients did not have specific brain lesions, the researchers looked for any brain regions where there was reduced function and in 85 per cent of cases these were part of the volition and/or agency networks.</p>
<p>So, perhaps damage to a node on the agency or volition network affects the functioning of the precuneus or the ACC, the researchers write – or perhaps volition and agency depend on all nodes in their networks working well. Either, or both, could be the case, and could help guide future investigations, diagnosis and therapeutic interventions.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>There are some important caveats in relation to this research, however. One of the biggest questions has to be around the interpretation of some of the neuropsychiatric disorders. For instance, it’s unclear exactly what’s going wrong in people with akinetic mutism and catatonia. Have they really lost the will to move or speak – their “volition”, as the researchers interpreted it – or is it rather the case that they experience problems with initiating a movement that they actually want to make? In which case, perhaps what the researchers have identified as a “volition network” is actually more about movement execution than volition (this would be consistent with prior research that’s found the ACC – which remember is a key part of the purported “volition network” – is involved in the planning and control of movements as well as the motivation to make them).</p>
<p>Also, as the researchers note, even if they have identified a volition network, it may not relate to free will as it’s commonly understood – in terms of social, legal and moral responsibility for decisions. “It remains unknown whether the network of brain regions we identify as related to free will for movements is the same as that important for moral decision making, as prior studies have suggested important differences.”</p>
<p>Scholarly debate about free will has been raging for at least a few thousand years. It’s certainly not over yet.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

Too many scientists defend the practice of not probing for loading controls for each protein gel. They say a "library" method perfectly suffices, when one separate loading control gel is run once for reference. Such sloppiness can sometimes be a hint of even worse practices taking place.

<p><em>By guest blogger</em> <a href="http://www.jessesingal.com/">Jesse Singal</a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It has been a long and bumpy road for the implicit association test (IAT), the reaction-time-based psychological instrument whose co-creators, Mahzarin Banaji and Anthony Greenwald — among others in their orbit — claimed measures test-takers’ levels of unconscious social biases</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> their propensity to act in a biased and discriminatory manner, be that via racism, sexism, ageism, or some other category, depending on the context. The test’s advocates claimed this was a revelatory development, not least because the IAT supposedly measures aspects of an individual’s bias even beyond what that individual was consciously aware of themselves. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As I explained in a</span><a href="https://www.thecut.com/2017/01/psychologys-racism-measuring-tool-isnt-up-to-the-job.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> lengthy feature published on New York Magazine’s website last year</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, many doubts have emerged about these claims, ranging from the question of what the IAT is really measuring (as in, can a reaction-time difference measured in milliseconds really be considered, on its face, evidence of real-world-relevant </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">bias</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">?) to the algorithms used to generate scores to, perhaps most importantly (given that the IAT has become a mainstay of a wide variety of diversity training and educational programmes), whether the test really does predict real-world behaviour.   </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On that last key point, there is surprising agreement. In 2015 </span><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25402677"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Greenwald, Banaji, and their coauthor Brian Nosek</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> stated that the psychometric issues associated with various IATs “render them problematic to use to classify persons as likely to engage in discrimination”. Indeed, these days IAT evangelist and critic alike mostly agree that the test is too noisy to usefully and accurately gauge people’s likelihood of engaging in discrimination — a finding supported by a series of meta-analyses showing unimpressive correlations between IAT scores and behavioral outcomes (mostly in labs). Race IAT scores appear to account for only about 1 per cent of the variance in measured behavioural outcomes, </span><a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/308926636_A_Meta-Analysis_of_Change_in_Implicit_Bias"><span style="font-weight: 400;">reports an important meta-analysis available in preprint</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, co-authored by Nosek. (That meta-analysis also looked at IAT-based interventions, finding that while implicit bias as measured by the IAT “is malleable… changing implicit bias does not necessarily lead to changes in explicit bias or behavior.”)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So where does this leave the IAT? In a </span><a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0963721418797309"><span style="font-weight: 400;">new paper in </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Current Directions in Psychological Science</span></i></a> <span style="font-weight: 400;">called “The IAT Is Dead, Long Live The Iat: Context-Sensitive Measures of Implicit Attitudes Are Indispensable to Social and Political Psychology”, John Jost, a social psychologist at New York University and a leading IAT researcher, seeks to draw a clear line between the “dead” diagnostic-version of the IAT, and what he sees as the test’s real-world version – a sensitive, context-specific measure that shouldn’t be used for diagnostic purposes, but which has potential in various research and educational contexts.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Does this represent a constructive manifesto for the future of this controversial psychological tool? Unfortunately, I don’t think it does – rather, it contains many confusions, false claims, and strawman arguments (as well as a misrepresentation of my own work). Perhaps most frustrating, Jost joins a lengthening line of IAT researchers who, when faced with the fact that the IAT appears to have been overhyped for a long time by its creators, most enthusiastic proponents, and by journalists, responds with an endless variety of counterclaims that don’t quite address the core issue itself, or which pretend those initial claims were never made in the first place.</span></p>
<p><span id="more-35513"></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Take this section, in which, referencing a number of papers, Jost writes that, </span></p>
<blockquote><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is often claimed that the IAT simply measures familiarity with or awareness of cultural stereotypes rather than personal animus… [T]he question of whether implicit attitudes reflect personal preferences as opposed to social and cultural processes is ill-posed. (We also know from decades of research on the “mere-exposure effect” that familiarity breeds liking, so there is no reason to assume that familiarity and attitudinal evaluation should be unrelated.)</span></p></blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is such a confusing paragraph that it’s hard to know where to start. Jost seems to be arguing that the “mere exposure effect”, the general principle that people like familiar things and people more than unfamiliar things and people, should be applied to the critique that the IAT might be measuring familiarity with stereotypes rather than endorsement of them. By his (apparent) logic, because of the mere exposure effect, people who are more familiar with stereotypes are more likely to endorse them, so it doesn’t matter if the IAT is really “just” measuring familiarity – idea-familiarity and idea-endorsement are inextricably bound. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Of course, if social psychologists really believed this, they would seek to halt educational programmes that teach children about ugly racial stereotypes out of a fear that the children will, on average, become more racist as a result of this exposure. Luckily, in the real world, the evidence suggests this is a rather radical overstretching of the idea of the mere exposure effect. To take one of countless examples, in the US, Democrats are exceedingly aware of the fact that some Republicans view Mexican migrants as disproportionately criminal – that does not make them more likely to endorse that belief themselves. Mere exposure is powerful in some contexts, but not this one.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So the question of whether the IAT measures something that can be fairly called </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">animus</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, in the sense of being a preference (in this case, an unconscious one) for one group over another, rather than familiarity with stereotypes, is </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">anything but</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> “ill-posed”. For a long time, people have been told that their test score reflects the former – that they have “implicit bias”. Outside of Jost’s confusing paragraph, no one anywhere would suggest that the definition of “implicit bias” is the same as the definition of “awareness of certain stereotypes.” If the test is claiming to measure one thing when it is really measuring the other, or a mix of the two (I’ve always thought it’s more likely the test is measuring a complicated mix of stuff than that it’s measuring A or B or C, full-stop), of course that’s an important issue to resolve. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jost’s paper also includes at least one rather misleading claim. In the third paragraph of his article, he writes that “In an especially absurd comparison, the IAT was likened to measuring height with a stack of melting ice cubes.” The citation points to my NY Mag article. In fact, Jost mentions height measurement three times in the paper and in the abstract, he critiques “false analogies between the IAT and measures… [like] physical height”. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But I never “likened” the IAT to any measure of height! Rather, in a section of my article explaining to my lay readers the term </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">test-retest reliability</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, I used ice cubes as an example to illustrate the concept: “A tape measure has high test-retest reliability because if you measure someone’s height, wait two weeks, and measure it again, you’ll get very similar results,” I wrote. “The measurement procedure of grabbing an ice cube from your freezer and seeing how many ice cubes tall your friend is would have much lower test-retest reliability, because different ice cubes might be of different sizes; it’s easier to make errors when counting how many ice cubes tall your friend is; and so forth.” It’s true that later in the article I note that the available evidence suggests the race IAT has low test-retest reliability, but that’s of course not the same as directly comparing — </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">likening</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> — the IAT to a measure of height.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As I mentioned, though, the biggest worry with this new review paper is that Jost is rewriting history a bit. Nowhere is this clearer than when he argues that “As a ‘bona fide’ pipeline used to quantify levels of ‘unconscious racism’ as a fixed property of the individual—or as a diagnostic tool to classify people as ‘having’ racism or sexism (like they might ‘have’ clinical depression)—the IAT is dead. I do not know if any researchers of implicit bias actually conceived of the IAT in these ways, but critics continue to assert that this is our conception (Bartlett, 2017; Mitchell &amp; Tetlock, 2017; Singal, 2017). It certainly is not mine.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But of </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">course</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> evangelists of the IAT have been treating it as a diagnostic tool. Here’s Banaji and Greenwald in </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Blindspot: Hidden Biases of Good People</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">:</span></p>
<blockquote><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[T]he automatic White preference expressed on the Race IAT is now established as signaling discriminatory behavior. It predicts discriminatory behavior even among research participants who earnestly (and, we believe, honestly) espouse egalitarian beliefs. That last statement may sound like a self-contradiction, but it’s an empirical truth. Among research participants who describe themselves as racially egalitarian, the Race IAT has been shown, reliably and repeatedly, to predict discriminatory behavior that was observed in the research.</span></p></blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here’s Greenwald, in an email, </span><a href="https://qz.com/1144504/the-world-is-relying-on-a-flawed-psychological-test-to-fight-racism/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">to Quartz’s Olivia Goldhill last year</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">: “The IAT can be used to select people who would be less likely than others to engage in discriminatory behavior.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now, to be clear there have been mixed messages on this front. The quote to Quartz was a serious flip-flop, as I </span><a href="http://nymag.com/intelligencer/2017/12/iat-behavior-problem.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">noted at the time</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, when stood up against the 2015 paper in which Greenwald and Banaji acknowledged the test’s weaknesses. But either way, it’s almost impossible to square Jost’s claim that he isn’t aware of anyone who has claimed the IAT measures “‘unconscious racism’ as a fixed property of the individual[…] or as a diagnostic tool to classify people as ‘having’ racism or sexism” with the fact that two of his coauthors have claimed that the IAT can predict individuals’ likelihood of engaging in discriminatory behavior.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Being charitable, I suppose there’s wiggle room with the word “fixed”.  But in the initial hyping of the IAT, its evangelists definitely promoted the idea that what it was measuring was, if not “fixed,” at the very least </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">stable</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> – you will not find much circa-2005 coverage of the IAT in which the test’s proponents highlight IAT results as fluid and easily manipulated. In fact, in the [1998] </span><a href="http://www.washington.edu/news/1998/09/29/roots-of-unconscious-prejudice-affect-90-to-95-percent-of-people-psychologists-demonstrate-at-press-conference/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">University of Washington press release covering the IAT’s unveiling</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the author notes that while “Banaji and Greenwald admitted being surprised and troubled by their own test results, they believe the test ultimately can have a positive effect despite its initial negative impact. The same test that reveals these roots of prejudice has the potential to let people learn more about and perhaps overcome these disturbing inclinations.” Why would this be an issue if the test </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">wasn’t</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> being promoted as measuring something stable that an individual could only “perhaps overcome”?  In 2005, Banaji went further, telling the Washington </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Post</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> she was ‘deeply embarrassed’ at her test result – but why would she be unless she considered the IAT was measuring something stable about herself? There’s a whole subgenre of anecdotes in which individuals reveal their discomfort at their IAT results. That doesn’t jibe with the idea that it has historically been viewed as a noisy, extremely context-dependent measure. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The goalposts are ever-shifting. Or maybe the better term is </span><a href="https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Motte_and_bailey"><span style="font-weight: 400;">motte and bailey</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the fallacy of advancing an argument you can’t justify with evidence, and then, when called on to do so, retreating to a much less controversial position. Bailey: </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">The IAT predicts individuals’ levels of unconscious bias (or racism, if you will), and therefore their future behavior.</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Then, after the convincing methodological critiques and underwhelming meta-analyses roll in, motte: </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">We never said the IAT predicts individuals’ levels of unconscious bias/racism</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> — rather, as Jost puts it, “[I]f the IAT measures a particular attitude at a given time in a specific social context, there is nothing inherently problematic (or unethical) about providing people with feedback concerning that attitude measurement, recognising that it is, after all, only one measurement at one point in time.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Setting aside that this clearly wasn’t how the test was presented to the millions of people who have taken it on the Harvard Implicit website and in diversity trainings and in other settings,, it’s a confusing claim: What is the “social context” of taking an IAT? It’s hard, in fact, to come up with a more </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">de</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">contextualized social-psychological experimental experience. You’re sitting at a computer, pecking at keys, not engaging in any interaction with another human being. Now, often IAT results </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">are</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> correlated </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">with</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> how people behave in certain (mostly quite canned) social contexts, but the vast bulk of the IAT research does </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">not</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> measure people’s “attitude at a given time in a given social context.” Or that hasn’t been the claim, at least.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The point is this: You can’t have it both ways. You can’t portray a test as revolutionary, </span><a href="https://www.edge.org/conversation/mahzarin_banaji-anthony_greenwald-the-implicit-association-test"><span style="font-weight: 400;">mention it in the same breath as the discovery of the telescope</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, suggest it offers new racial insights on the order of Michelle Alexander’s or Ta-Nehisi Coates’ (as claimed in an email from one of Banaji’s students that she forwarded to the Quartz reporter Goldhill), and claim it does this and that and the other thing – and then pretend you never said those things. It’s just such a worst-case example of science communications, and on a vitally important subject, no less. This whole debate has been quite demoralising.</span></p>

<p>In this seminar, I introduce the <a class="reference external" href="https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/SIGs/NeuroFedora">NeuroFedora</a> initiative to the group. I
explain our goals, our philosophy, our methods, our current state and, solicit
feedback on our work.</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>The (current) goal of the <a class="reference external" href="https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/SIGs/NeuroFedora">NeuroFedora SIG</a> is to provide a ready to use
platform for neuroscientists.  We aim to do this by making commonly used
Neuroscience software easily installable on a <a class="reference external" href="https://getfedora.org">Fedora</a> Linux system.</p>
<p>Neuroscience is an extremely multidisciplinary field. It brings together
mathematicians, chemists, biologists, physicists, psychologists, engineers
(electrical and others), computer scientists, and more. A lot of software is
used nowadays in Neuroscience for:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>data collection, analysis, and sharing.</li>
<li>image processing (a lot of ML is used here, think Data Science).</li>
<li>simulation of brain networks (<a class="reference external" href="https://neuron.yale.edu/neuron/">NEURON</a>, <a class="reference external" href="https://nest-simulator.org">Nest</a>, <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/BhallaLab/moose">Moose</a>, <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/NeuralEnsemble/PyNN">PyNN</a>, <a class="reference external" href="http://briansimulator.org/">Brian</a>).</li>
<li>dissemination of scientific results (peer reviewed and otherwise, think
<a class="reference external" href="http://tug.org/">LaTeX</a>).</li>
</ul>
<p>Given that a large proportion of neuroscientists are not trained in computer
science, a lot of resources are spent setting up systems, installing software
(often building whole <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dependency_hell">dependency chains</a> from source). This can be
especially hard for people not well-versed in software development and related
fields.</p>
<p>So, at <a class="reference external" href="https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/SIGs/NeuroFedora">NeuroFedora</a>, we aim to enable Neuroscience research by providing a
ready to use <a class="reference external" href="https://getfedora.org">Fedora</a> based system for researchers to work with. <a class="reference external" href="https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/SIGs/NeuroFedora">NeuroFedora</a> is
<a class="reference external" href="https://www.fsf.org/about/what-is-free-software">Free software</a> and is
therefore free to all to use, modify, study, and share.</p>

<p>It’s well-known that physical exercise is beneficial not just to physical health but also our mental health. Yet whereas most countries have detailed, evidence-backed guidelines on the type and intensity of exercise required for various physical health benefits, such guidelines do not yet exist for exercise and mood. This is partly due to a lack of necessary evidence. However, a <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/00223980.2018.1470487">new systematic review</a> in <em>The Journal of Psychology Interdisciplinary and Applied </em>brings us usefully up-to-date on the current findings in this area, collating evidence from 38 relevant studies that examined the associations between exercise intensity, duration and modality and any effects on mood.</p>
<p><span id="more-35492"></span></p>
<p>Before dipping into some of the key take-aways, an important distinction made in the review is between aerobic exercise and anaerobic. The former involves such things as walking, jogging and cycling and means exercising in such a way that your body is able to use oxygen to burn fat for energy. In contrast, anaerobic exercise – such as lifting heavy weights or sprinting – is of such vigorous intensity that your body does not have time to use oxygen to create energy and so instead it breaks down glucose in your blood or muscles.</p>
<p>Beginning first with the influence of exercise intensity on the mood benefits of aerobic exercise, the researchers, led by John Chan at Shenzhen University, found contradictory results from 19 relevant studies. Some favoured higher intensity, others low, while seven studies found that intensity made no difference to mood benefits.</p>
<p>In relation to the intensity of anaerobic exercise, however, the results were far clearer – the optimum for improving mood is moderate intensity, perhaps because low intensity is too dull while high intensity is too unpleasant.</p>
<p>Next, Chan’s team considered exercise duration. The main finding here was that 10 minutes often appears sufficient to achieve gains in mood (although one study found that 30 minutes was required to achieve feelings of increased vigour). Overall, there was little evidence that going beyond 30 minutes leads to any further gains in mood, which is good to know for anyone who struggles to find much time for exercise in their daily schedule.</p>
<p>Finally, the researchers considered studies that have compared the mood benefits of aerobic and anaerobic exercise (they noted that mindfulness-based physical exercise, such as Yoga and Thai-Chi, have also shown promise for boosting mood, but that there is too little evidence to draw any firm conclusions). The picture here was that the beneficial mood effects of aerobic exercise are less consistent than is found with anaerobic exercise, and anaerobic exercise appears especially to be more beneficial for beating stress and anxiety (the researchers suggested this may be because with many forms of anaerobic exercise, such as weight training, it is easier to see your progress, leading to more immediate, rewarding feelings of mastery; also anaerobic exercise is associated with increases in BDNF – brain-derived neurotrophic factor – which may help foster beneficial structural and functional changes in the brain).</p>
<p>These headline results from several decades of research come with some hefty caveats. The studies were mostly lab based, used different ways of measuring intensity, and they recruited extremely varied volunteers. You can easily imagine how study findings could differ a lot depending on people’s past experience with exercise, their age and health, and even their personality and interests.</p>
<p>This makes it difficult to extrapolate from the findings to our own lives. However, when reflecting on the optimum type of exercise for your own mood, the common sense message is probably to take into consideration your own fitness level and preferences, to find that sweet spot, such that the exercise is enough of a challenge without being unpleasant.</p>
<p>Perhaps the most important lesson from this review, though, is that we clearly need much more research into how different types and intensities of exercise affect our mood in real life, and how this varies according to our own characteristics. The sophistication and ubiquity of modern fitness trackers should open up exciting new opportunities for psychology research that can address these questions.</p>

<p>Curiosity is a welcome trait in many respects and is the fuel that powers science. Yet literature is filled with fables that warn of the seductive danger of curiosity (think of how Orpheus loses his wife Eurydice forever after he succumbs to the temptation to glimpse at the underworld). In real life too, we all know the regret that can follow if we give in to curiosity – glancing at a private message that we shouldn’t have, for instance, reading a TV review when we know it contains spoilers, or trying out what happens if you put metal in a microwave (tip: don’t).</p>
<p>From whence does curiosity derive such power over us? One answer lies in the brain. In a pair of brain-imaging studies <a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2018/11/22/473975">published as a preprint at <em>bioRxiv</em></a> – aptly titled <em>Hunger For Knowledge: How The Irresistible Lure of Curiosity Is Generated In the Brain</em> – Johnny King Lau and his colleagues have shown that curiosity appears to be driven by the same neurobiological process as physical hunger.</p>
<p><span id="more-35453"></span></p>
<p>The researchers laid the groundwork for their brain-scan research with a small behavioural experiment in which hungry volunteers were shown either magic tricks or pictures of tempting food, and then presented with a lottery wheel. This wheel provided a visual presentation of the odds of a gamble (which varied from trial to trial) – if they won, they would have an increased chance at the end of the experiment to learn how the trick was done or to eat the food; if they lost, it was more likely they would suffer a mild but unpleasant electric shock at the end of the experiment. Each trial the volunteers rated their curiosity about the trick or the desirability of the food, and then chose whether to take the gamble or not.</p>
<p>The main finding here was that curiosity and hunger both swayed the volunteers’ decision-making. Above and beyond the actual odds on any trial, the volunteers were more likely to take gambles when they were more curious about the magic or more tempted by the food, even at the risk of suffering an electric shock.</p>
<p>This led Lau and his colleagues to hypothesise that curiosity fuels a physiological wanting or craving, similar to hunger. To test this, they repeated the set-up with more volunteers and this time scanned their brains too. The results showed that, whether influenced by hunger or curiosity, when their participants opted to take the gamble, activity was greater in a key region of the brain known as the striatum, which is known to be associated with motivation and reward. Moreover, when driven to make the gamble, the participants showed a greater disconnect between the striatum and the sensorimotor cortex, indicative perhaps of a discounting of the physical risks of their decision (I would add a caveat: it is always difficult to interpret the functional meaning of brain activity, especially in exploratory work of this kind, so this interpretation should probably be considered tentative).</p>
<p>Similar findings emerged from a second brain-imaging study in which curiosity was provoked by obscure, intriguing trivia quiz questions rather than by magic (a typical question was “What is the only food that never spoils?”). In this case, if the participants opted to gamble, and won, then they increased their chance of finding out the answer later. Again, opting to gamble to satisfy curiosity, or hunger, was associated with greater activity in the striatum, and a greater disconnect between striatum and sensorimotor cortex.</p>
<p>Lau’s team said their findings show that “curiosity biases our decision-making by recruiting the same incentive motivation process as extrinsic rewards (e.g. foods).” If you’re curious to find out more, <a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2018/11/22/473975">the full paper</a>, which has not yet be finalised, is currently free to view online.</p>

<h2>Packaging MATLab tool boxes</h2>
<p>The use of MATLab tool boxes is quite common in data-analysis. There's a
noticeable movement in the scientific community towards using Python, but the
work that has already been done, and the eco-systems that have developed around
MATlab will take time to migrate to a Python based eco-system.</p>
<p>A majority of the tool boxes in use are Free/Open Source, but MATLab itself is
not. As supporters of Free/Open source, we will not attempt to include MATLab
in Fedora, but the question remains on whether we provide the toolboxes.  We've
begun discussing this in the SIG, and we'll reach out to the broader Fedora
community before we decide on how to proceed.</p>
<div class="section" id="personal-views">
<h3>Personal views</h3>
<p>Personally, I'd prefer if we only provided software that support Free/Open
source eco systems. The use of proprietary software in science, while currently
necessary, should be avoided.  Yes, it may make things a little harder to start
with, but the Free/Open source tools that will be used will be accessible by
all. Overtime, just like the Free software community, the eco system will
mature.</p>
<p>A example case is the use of Microsoft products that is common in developed
countries where universities can afford their licenses. In developing
countries, this is not the case. They cannot always afford these fees. A
solution, of course, is to use <a class="reference external" href="https://www.latex-project.org">LaTeX</a> which is free for all to use, extend,
study, and share. Similarly, while universities and laboratories in developed
countries may be able to pay for MATlab licenses, this financial requirement
can hold back others---smaller labs and independent researchers.</p>
<p>If proprietary tools such as MATlab are the norm, then science is not open to
all. It should be.</p>

The science story of the past week was the claim from Chinese scientist He Jiankui that he has created gene-edited human babies. Prof. He reports that two twin girls have been born carrying modifications of the gene CCR5, which is intended to protect them against future HIV risk.

It's far from clear yet whether the gene-editing that He described has actually taken place - no data has yet been presented.  The very prospect of genetically-modifying human beings has, however, led to widespread c

<p><em>By guest blogger</em> <a href="http://www.jessesingal.com/">Jesse Singal</a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Replicating a study isn’t easy. Just knowing how the original was conducted isn’t enough. Just having access to a sample of experimental participants isn’t enough. As psychological researchers have known for a long time, all sorts of subtle cues can affect how individuals respond in experimental settings. A failure to replicate, then, doesn’t always mean that the effect being studied isn’t there – it can simply mean the new study was conducted a bit differently.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Many Labs 2, a project of the Center for Open Science at the University of Virginia, embarked on one of the most ambitious replication efforts in psychology yet – and did so in a way designed to address these sorts of critiques, which have in some cases hampered past efforts. The resultant paper, a preprint of which can be viewed </span><a href="https://www.psychologicalscience.org/redesign/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/ManyLabs2.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400;">here</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, is lead-authored by Richard A. Klein of the Université Grenoble Alpes. Klein and his very, very large team – it takes almost four pages of the preprint just to list all the contributors – “conducted preregistered replications of 28 classic and contemporary published findings with protocols that were peer-reviewed in advance to examine variation in effect magnitudes across sample and setting.”</span></p>
<p><span id="more-35469"></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Many Labs included 79 samples of participants tested in-person and 46 samples tested online, and of these, 39 were from the U.S. and 86 came from a variety of other countries. Among the previously published findings the researchers tried to replicate were: one in which study participants who read about structure in nature said they were more likely to pursue their goals than those who read about randomness in nature (as if exposure to structure, even if unrelated, somehow motivates us); a famous example of a “framing effect” by the behavioural-economics pioneers Amos Tversky and Danny Kahneman, in which respondents were more willing to drive further to get a discount on a cheap item than to get an equal-sized discount on an expensive item (which doesn’t make sense, “rationally” speaking, when the discounts are the same size); and another famous finding, this one from a team led by the leading social psychologist Jonathan Haidt, that showed that, among survey respondents, “Items that emphasised concerns of harm or fairness… were deemed more relevant for moral judgment by the political left than right.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Overall, 15 of the 28 attempted replications “worked,” in the sense of delivering the same finding in the same direction at a statistically significant level (p &lt; .05). When the threshold for significance was bumped up a couple orders of magnitude to p &lt; .0001 – a stricter standard some researchers have advocated as a countermeasure against </span><a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2011/12/01/questionable-research-practices-are-rife-in-psychology-survey-suggests/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">questionable research practices</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> like </span><a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2012/08/09/made-it-an-uncanny-number-of-psychology-findings-manage-to-scrape-into-statistical-significance/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">p-hacking</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> – that number dropped to 14. So in total, only about half the studies replicated, and on average, the effect sizes were significantly smaller. This is not encouraging. (The study about nature-stories and goals failed to replicate, but the Tversky/Kahneman and Haidt ones did replicate, albeit with smaller effect sizes than in the originals.)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Many Labs 2 was designed to address some of the problems, perceived and real, with previous replication efforts. After the Open Science Collaboration </span><a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2015/08/27/this-is-what-happened-when-psychologists-tried-to-replicate-100-previously-published-findings/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">published the “Reproducibility Project”</span></a>, <span style="font-weight: 400;">which was only able to successfully replicate about 40 percent of 100 then-recent papers in August 2015, for example, a team – including the famous social psychologist Dan Gilbert (a replication-crisis sceptic) and the leading quantitative social scientist Gary King – argued that there were statistical errors in that effort, and also that in some cases the replicators hadn’t followed the same procedures, or used the same sorts of samples, as the original experimenters. (The whole thing got rather tangled and included responses to responses to responses – you can read my writeup for </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">New York</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> magazine </span><a href="https://www.thecut.com/2016/03/is-psychologys-replication-crisis-really-overblown.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">here</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The question of whether replications are “close enough” to the original is especially important. When replications differ enough from the original studies, this introduces legitimate methodological concerns into the equation and gives those whose work fails to replicate an “out” – “You weren’t really replicating </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">my</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> study – you changed too much stuff.” But researchers in Many Labs 2 were more careful to follow the original studies quite closely. As a result, they argue, “variability in observed effect sizes was more attributable to the effect being studied than the sample or setting in which it was studied.” Specifically, “task order, administration in lab versus online, and exploratory WEIRD versus less WEIRD culture comparisons” – that is, whether the experiment participants were western, educated, and from industrialised rich democratic countries (a </span><a href="https://psmag.com/social-justice/joe-henrich-weird-ultimatum-game-shaking-up-psychology-economics-53135"><span style="font-weight: 400;">major concern in psych research</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, where it’s often much easier to find WEIRD study participants than non-WEIRD ones) – all failed to account for much of the differences in effect strength observed in the studies. This partially undercuts the idea that these sorts of differences might have mattered or account for failures to replicate, and it also shows that psychology can be conducted in a robust way such that the findings – whether positive or negative – are not unduly influenced by the circumstances.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Moreover, </span><a href="https://twitter.com/BrianNosek/status/1064548916862099456"><span style="font-weight: 400;">explained</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Brian Nosek, head of the Open Science Center and a coauthor on the paper, on Twitter, this time around researchers “minimised boring reasons for failure. First, using original materials &amp; </span><a href="http://cos.io/rr"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Registered Reports</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> all 28 replications met expert reviewed quality control standards. Failure to replicate not easily dismissed as replication incompetence.” He </span><a href="https://twitter.com/BrianNosek/status/1064548910872580101"><span style="font-weight: 400;">also pointed out</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that the “Replication median sample size (n = 7157) was 64x original median sample size (n = 112). If there was an effect to detect, even a much smaller one, we would detect it. Ultimate estimates have very high precision.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Of course, a single failed replication – even a big, robust one – should not cause us to confidently rule </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">out</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> an effect any more than a single positive result should cause us to believe it is definitely real. But this big, impressive effort advances the replication conversation in two important ways: It adds to the pile of evidence that there </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">is</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> a replication crisis, and it offers a useful, replicable (sorry) set of guidelines for how to conduct rigorous replications that actually measure what experts are interested in, rather than accidentally sweeping up other stuff.</span></p>

<p>After a trauma many people have the sense it has changed them for the better, such as granting them a new appreciation for life or improving their relationships. This has given rise to the appealing notion that there is such a thing as “post-traumatic growth”. However, the majority of investigations into this phenomenon have relied on asking people whether they believe they have changed; very few have assessed people prior to a trauma and then re-assessed them afterwards to see if positive changes have actually occurred.</p>
<p>A new <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0265407518811662">study</a> in the <em>Journal of Social and Personal Relationships</em> is the first to apply this kind of “prospective design” in the context of relationship breakups in young adults, and – unfortunately for anyone who found comfort and inspiration in the principle of post-traumatic growth – the authors Meghan Owenz and Blaine Fowers say their findings are more consistent with the idea that such growth is mostly illusory, the result of a positive re-appraisal of the breakup and one’s current situation.</p>
<p><span id="more-35452"></span></p>
<p>The researchers recruited 599 undergrads currently in a romantic relationship and assessed them twice on a range of measures: at the beginning, and near the end of the semester. During that time, 100 of them lived through their relationship breaking up, an experience that, typically for their age group, they found extremely distressing (in fact, on a formal scale they rated their feelings of distress on a par with those reported by survivors of natural disasters and cardiac surgery).</p>
<p>At the start of the semester, all the participants completed a version of the commonly used “post-traumatic growth inventory” that had been slightly reworked to refer to their feelings over the last couple of weeks – such as whether they had experienced a sense of closeness with others over that time or had an appreciation for each day.</p>
<p>Near the end of the semester, all the participants re-took this same revamped version of the growth inventory, thus providing a before and after measure of their general outlook and behaviour. Importantly, the 100 students who’d been through a breakup also took the classic version of the inventory, rating how much they felt they had changed for the better in the same domains (such as closeness to others and life appreciation, among others) but specifically as a result of their relationship trauma.</p>
<p>Comparing early- and late-semester scores on the revamped growth inventory, there was no evidence for positive change, and no evidence that the students who’d been through a break-up showed any more improvement than the students who had not. In contrast, the break-up students did report feeling that the trauma had changed them for the better. Moreover, this perception of growth was higher for students who previously described themselves as more optimistic and who found their breakup more distressing.</p>
<p>Owenz and Fowers believe these findings are consistent with the idea that the perception of growth after trauma is illusory, arising from a (positive) re-appraisal of the situation. Colloquially we might invoke Freud and call this a defence mechanism – looking on the bright side as a way to cope (something that the more optimistic students, and more distressed students, were more inclined to do). More generally, the researchers acknowledge that <em>actual</em> positive growth may be a reality for some people, but they think it unlikely for most.</p>
<p>Future research might paint a different picture. The current findings pertain to young people in a specific culture going through a specific kind of trauma, and they were tested over a relatively short time frame. For now, though, these authors and others believe the burden is on advocates of the existence of post-traumatic growth to provide more robust evidence for their claims, especially using study designs that do not rely purely on people’s subjective and retrospective reports of change. The current situation – where post-traumatic growth is considered a reality based on limited research – Owenz and Fowers find  “…particularly worrisome, given the rapid move from research ‘documenting’ post-traumatic growth to interventions and self-help books designed to promote an approach to trauma that remains questionable.”</p>

About 99% of patients with cancer of the pancreas have adenocarcinoma, a type of malignant tumor, and the 5-year survival rate for patients with adenocarcinoma of the pancreas is about 3-5%.</p>
<p>The survival rate has improved somewhat in recent years because of developments in surgery and surgical critical care, resulting in better results after resection. However, despite aggressive surgical resection, 95-97% of these patients still die within 5 years. One of the problems is that there are no adjuvant treatments (therapy applied after surgery) which are routinely effective. Surgery is most effective in patients with early stage disease but approximately 90% of patients with the disease already have metastases at the time of diagnosis and surgery will not benefit them.</p>
<p>There are many investigators studying the characteristics and growth of pancreatic cancer at the cellular and sub-cellular levels. This approach may eventually result in the development of effective therapies, although this may take a long time. It is hoped, for example that immunotherapies could be developed to attack specific, but as yet unidentified, markers on the cell surface of pancreas cancer cells. Understanding malignancies at the cellular and sub-cellular level is essential for the development of effective therapies.</p>
<h3><strong>Complementing cellular research with computer models</strong></h3>
<blockquote><p>The computer models we are developing may assist in identifying the best time to administer a yet to be developed agent that is effective against pancreas cancer.</p></blockquote>
<p>Another approach is the one we are taking, to study the growth of the entire tumor in the patient, using data from computed tomography imaging. We are obtaining this data and fitting it to innovative models of cancer growth. This approach is complementary to cellular research to develop an effective adjuvant therapy for this disease.</p>
<p>The computer models we are developing may assist in identifying the best time to administer a yet to be developed agent that is effective against pancreas cancer. Our expectation is that we can use a computer model to understand the growth of the entire tumor based on data from other patients. Ultimately this approach may contribute to the effectiveness of future agents against pancreatic cancer.</p>
<p>The approach we are taking to treating pancreatic cancer should also help to improve awareness and understanding of this disease. We are using computer models, which is a new approach to cancer therapy. One aspect of this approach is that people will be able to understand exactly where their own tumors fit into the pattern of data from many other patients. This results in a form of “personalized therapy” where the timing of administration of the anticancer agent would depend on the growth pattern of the patient’s individual tumor growth pattern.</p>
<p>There is little question that the current outlook for therapy given to patients with cancer of the pancreas is bleak. The only curative treatment is surgery but only 10% of patients with the disease are even eligible for surgery. We must continue to develop new approaches to therapy. The research we are doing may help to guide optimal administration of these new treatments, with a personalized approach based on the growth characteristics of a patient’s own unique tumor.</p>

<p><em>By</em> <a href="http://www.psychologywriter.org.uk/">Christian Jarrett</a></p>
<p>It feels selfish to fret – it’s the other person who is suffering – but agonising over what to say to a friend in need can be incredibly anxiety provoking. If you want to be supportive (and not make matters worse), what are the right words to say to someone who has experienced a relationship break-up, for instance, or lost their job? Should you express sympathy, downplay the situation, say you know how they feel, or something else entirely? A series of studies <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/01973533.2018.1509341">in <em>Basic and Applied Social Psychology</em></a> will offer relief to anyone who has ever agonised over this predicament – the findings suggest that in fact there are few, if any, “magic statements that, if spoken, would provide lasting comfort to the recipient.”</p>
<p>Shawna Tanner at Wayne State University and her colleagues propose that in all likelihood trying too hard to say the right thing could actually lead you to make “clumsy statements that do more harm than good”. They advise that as long as your friend or relative sees you as supportive, then your “mere presence and sympathy is likely enough”.</p>
<p><span id="more-35430"></span></p>
<p>Tanner’s team first re-analysed data published in 2008 that involved nearly 300 schoolchildren (aged 10 to 15) rating the supportiveness of six statements. These were ostensibly made by one friend to another, who had either had an academic set-back or been rejected from a group picnic. The six statements represented different supportive strategies such as offering sympathy, being optimistic or minimising the seriousness of the situation. There was barely any agreement between the children in their ratings of the supportiveness of the statements. A more important factor was the children’s own tendencies – some of them, more than others, were inclined to see the statements as generally more supportive. Comfort, then, is in the ears of the listener, not the words themselves.</p>
<p>A new study backed this up. The researchers asked 54 undergrads to rate the supportiveness of 96 statements across eight hypothetical situations, deliberately composed to appeal to people with certain personality traits – for example, there were positive-thinking type statements designed to appeal to optimists (e.g. “things have a funny way of working out for the best”) and community-minded statements designed to appeal to people with a sociable, collegiate disposition (e.g. “Well, your friends like you better anyway and now you can spend more time with us”). Once again, there was very little agreement between the students in which statements were considered the more supportive, and this was the case even when restricting the analysis to sub-groups of the students with similar personality traits. Instead, more relevant were participants’ own idiosyncrasies – how they happened to like some supportive statements but not others.</p>
<p>Finally, in an effort to increase the realism of their investigation, the researchers asked 33 clinical psychologists, undergrad and graduate clinical trainees to rate the supportiveness of statements made by therapists in therapy training videos. Once more there was little agreement about which statements were the more supportive, even among the sub-groups (for instance, among the qualified clinical psychologists specifically).</p>
<p>The background to these new findings is that past research has shown there is also little agreement between people about the trait supportiveness, or not, of other individuals. Tanner’s team reasoned that this subjectivity need not necessarily apply to supportive utterances, but it seems it does. There is not something about certain people, nor certain carefully chosen words, that makes them universally comforting. Rather – and likely for highly complex reasons – we each have an idiosyncratic take on who is supportive and which words we find most helpful. While further research is needed to confirm this take – including studies in more realistic situations and involving people from varied cultures – for now this message should bring reassurance to anyone who has worried about saying the right thing to a friend or relative in need.</p>

<p>The brightest STEM high school students can now work side-by-side with preeminent scientists at one of the world’s leading neuroscience research institutions. The Florida Atlantic University Max Planck Academy on the John D. MacArthur Campus in Jupiter stands to redefine approaches to STEM (science-technology-engineering and math) education, not just in South Florida, but nationwide.</p>
<p>“Based on historical educational reform efforts, the FAU Max Planck Academy will be the most consequential shift in the delivery of education in the United States in decades,” said Joel Herbst, Ed.D., superintendent of FAU PK-12 schools and educational programs. “This is a significant pivot from the traditional model of delivering education. We are offering exceptional high school students an extraordinary opportunity to work alongside renowned scientists. As the only program of its kind in the world, the Academy will serve as the new model for STEM education delivery.”</p>
<p>The FAU Max Planck Academy is the latest partnership between FAU, the Max Planck Florida Institute for Neuroscience (MPFI) and the Germany-based Max Planck Society, expanding on similar opportunities for FAU’s <span><a href="http://www.fau.edu/newsdesk/articles/BratiDas-IBAN.php">graduate</a></span> and <span><a href="https://www.fau.edu/newsdesk/articles/fau-max-planck-society-undergraduate-honors-program.php">undergraduate students</a></span>. This unprecedented program will open the laboratories of Max Planck to high school students, allowing them to participate in world-class research and scientific discoveries as part of their curriculum.  Six high-achieving FAU High students currently are dual-enrolled in an Academy pilot program, directly learning from scientists – including Nobel Laureates – and spending time in MPFI labs.  The students were selected based on the following criteria: National Merit Scholars, strong academic achievement as measured by a high grade point average and an expressed interest in data science.</p>
<p>The Academy will be organized as a standalone extension of FAU High School – a nationally recognized, public “Blue Ribbon School” located on FAU’s Boca Raton campus that offers an accelerated pre-collegiate program where students work toward a cost-free bachelor’s degree and high school diploma simultaneously. The Academy in Jupiter will offer a unique and individualized program for students, starting in their junior year of high school. Enriched, honors academic pathways in STEM will be pursued, including neuroscience, biological sciences, chemistry, engineering and computer science. These students will ultimately gain priority admission into the undergraduate Max Planck Honors program which was launched last spring.</p>
<p>FAU Max Planck Academy students will assist MPFI researchers in a number of ways, such as engaging in laboratory research, organizing and analyzing big data using machine learning and other advanced computational techniques, or assisting in MPFI’s state-of-the-art Scientific Core facilities, such as electron microscopy, molecular biology, and the Imaging Center. Benefiting from the international presence of MPFI and the Max Planck Society, the Academy experience will lead to extraordinary international networking, mentorship, and study abroad opportunities.</p>
<p>“The Max Planck Society has a long history of investing in the education of the next generation of scientists. Our ideal has always to been to provide the most promising minds with state-of-the-art resources and opportunities. We have proudly educated thousands of junior scientists at the college, Ph.D. and postdoctoral level, and are now excited to extend the Max Planck model of scientific excellence to the high-school level,” said David Fitzpatrick, Ph.D., CEO and scientific director of MPFI.</p>
<p>Four years ago, FAU President John Kelly explored expanding the FAU High program to offer targeted educational tracks for specific disciplines.</p>
<p>“We explored how we could scale and replicate FAU High, as well as build specific pipelines to various disciplines for our best students,” said Kelly. “Just a few years later, FAU High has gone from 78 students to 570. We’ve since launched the <span><a href="https://www.fau.edu/newsdesk/articles/fau-launches-first-md-pipeline-program.php">M.D. Direct pipeline</a></span>, securing seats in our Schmidt College of Medicine for high school students interested in becoming physicians, and now we’re launching the FAU Max Planck Academy for the brightest STEM students. This new program could not have happened without the hard work of our superintendent Joel Herbst and his team, and a shared vision with the leadership at Max Planck.”</p>
<p>Approximately 35-50 students will be admitted in the inaugural class, eventually scaling up to about 50 students. Beginning in 2019, the highly selective application process will target National Merit semifinalists, as well as the best STEM students from around the world. The first class is slated to begin in fall 2020 and to graduate in spring 2022. Students who successfully complete this exceptional program will earn a high school diploma embossed with both the FAU and Max Planck seals, and at least two years of accelerated college credit – tuition free – leading to elite research experiences and distinction through the FAU Max Planck Honors program and accelerated bachelor’s degree at FAU.</p>
<p>“This new STEM education model can be replicated with other elite research organizations to help them find new talent, which is needed as many studies point to a looming shortfall in STEM degrees verses STEM workforce needs,” said Herbst. “We believe the best evidence-based strategy to help combat the STEM employment gap is the early college, high school approach.”</p>

<p>A new survey of beliefs held by social psychologists (335 mostly US-based members of the Society of Experimental Social Psychology) has confirmed previous reports that the field is overwhelmingly populated by researchers of a left-wing, liberal bent. What’s more, David Buss and William von Hippel – the evolutionary social psychologists who conducted and analysed the survey – say their findings, <a href="http://psycnet.apa.org/record/2018-57934-001">published open-access in <em>Archives of Scientific Psychology</em></a>, suggest that some social psychologists may be opposed, for ideological reasons, to insights rooted in evolutionary psychology.</p>
<p>Buss and von Hippel add that compounding matters is an irony – the desire of some researchers to signal their ideological stance and commitment to others who share their political views, which is a manifestation of the evolved human adaptation to form coalitions. “Part of this virtue signalling entails rejecting a caricature of evolutionary psychology that no scientist actually holds,” they write.</p>
<p><span id="more-35417"></span></p>
<p>In terms of the political bias among social psychologists, Buss and von Hippel found that 95 per cent were mostly liberal and left-wing in their views (also, among the US respondents, only 4 had voted Republican in the prior Presidential election while 305 had voted Democrat).</p>
<p>Quizzing the social psychologists on their views of evolutionary theory, Buss and von Hippel found that they overwhelmingly accepted the principles of Darwinian evolution and also that it applied to humans, but when it came to whether evolutionary theory applies to human psychology and behaviour, the sample was split, with many social psychologists rejecting this notion.</p>
<p>Digging deeper into the survey results, there was no evidence that the social psychologists were averse to evolutionary psychology for religious reasons, but many did reject the idea that humans might be inherently violent (in certain situations) or that some people are widely considered more physically attractive than others due to universal evolved standards of attractiveness – perhaps, Buss and von Hippel suggested, this is because “they dislike the implications regarding <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2018/10/12/what-are-we-like-10-psychology-findings-that-reveal-the-worst-of-human-nature/">the dark side of human nature</a>.”</p>
<p>Next, Buss and von Hippel asked the social psychologists about their views on the truth of five hot button statements related to the biological basis of average sex differences, such as whether such differences are primarily genetic rather than environmental, whether sex-differentiated hormones play a role, and whether it might be more difficult for men than women to stay faithful in long-term romantic relationships.</p>
<p>Answers to three of these five hot-button questions accounted for a small but statistically significant amount of the variance in the social psychologists’ position on whether evolutionary theory applies to human psychology and their self-reported political ideology. This pattern is consistent with the idea that, while the relation between political ideology and scientific beliefs is complex, some social psychologists are inclined to reject evolutionary psychology findings on ideological grounds (in keeping with this interpretation, a substantial portion of the sample said it would be bad if the hot-button findings were widely reported).</p>
<p>As a case in point, Buss and von Hippel highlight the recent book <em>Testosterone Rex:</em> <em>Unmaking the Myths of Our Gendered Minds</em> by psychologist Cordelia Fine – a text that argues against biological differences between the sexes (and in favour of sociological explanations) and which won wide <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/jan/18/testosterone-rex-review-cordelia-fine">praise from journalists</a> and <a href="https://royalsociety.org/news/2017/09/cordelia-fine-wins-30th-anniversary-royal-society-insight-investment-science-book-prize/">left-leaning scientists</a> around the globe, while at the same time receiving scathing criticism from <a href="https://whyevolutionistrue.wordpress.com/2017/09/28/a-new-critique-of-cordelia-fines-testosterone-rex/">evolutionary biologists</a> and <a href="https://quillette.com/2017/03/21/cordelia-fines-testosterone-rex-a-review/">psychologists</a> with relevant expertise in evolutionary science.</p>
<p>Buss and von Hippel argue that Fine and others are motivated by social justice goals (in this case gender equality) to reject findings from evolutionary biology and psychology – or a caricature of them. But they believe this is a mistake, not only for the obvious reason that it is wrong to misrepresent the evidence, but also because important moral principles – such as equality – should not be founded on the the idea that there are no biological differences between women and men. Here they quote the author and evolutionary psychologist Steven Pinker, who argued, “… equality is not the empirical claim that all groups of humans are interchangeable; it is the moral principle that individuals should not be judged or constrained by the average properties of their group.”</p>
<p>Buss and von Hippel think that, motivated by principles of social justice, many social psychologists are ideologically opposed to what they mistakenly think evolutionary psychology argues for – namely genetic determinism, environmental irrelevance, and the idea that attempts to change human behaviour are doomed to fail. In fact, these are erroneous caricatures and evolutionary psychology does not espouse any of these beliefs. It does though recognise that we are not blank slates and that our minds and behaviour have been shaped by evolution in important ways.</p>
<p>Critically, Buss and von Hippel make the point that recognising our evolved psychological adaptations and predilections will actually lead to more effective efforts toward social justice (on the other hand, denying the biological roots of human nature will surely blind researchers from understanding some of the important factors at play in the social injustices that they seek to address). The pair add that, ironically, it is the evolved human tendency to form coalitions that leads “…social scientists to signal ideological commitments to their presumptive coalitions rather than to ferret out the most compelling scientific theories and empirical findings.”</p>
<p>On an optimistic note, Buss and von Hippel point out that their survey found that a substantial minority of social psychologists <em>did</em> endorse findings rooted in evolutionary biology. But still there is a long way to go until the schism in psychological and theoretical perspectives is bridged – a situation they believe is likely made worse by the lack of proper training in evolutionary sciences in psychology*. “Not a single degree-granting institution in the United States, to our knowledge, requires even a single course in evolutionary biology as part of a degree in psychology,” they write, adding that this is “an astonishing educational gap that disconnects psychology from the rest of the life sciences.”</p>

<h4>When cortex is useless, what do we learn?</h4><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/938/1*DbFF6adUhl5a8u_yOaec5g.png" />Chameleon Designs / Noun Project</figure><p>The cortex, that many layered cake of neurons, occupies a special place in neuroscience. Our best guess at the root of our prodigious intellectual abilities — of language, of sculpture, of base-jumping in a kilt — is that our cortex is far more dense with neurons than any other species. Our dominant sense, sight, commands a third or more of the entire cortex. And its exquisite circuitry hints at devilishly complex computations, of probabilities, of inference, of algorithms that AIs can only dream of. If we want to understand the brain from a human perspective, the cortex is where we must start.</p><p>(The fact that it is also by far the easiest part of the brain to record from in both animals and humans, as it’s right at the top, is <strong>entirely coincidental</strong>, and shall not detain us further here.)</p><p>So it’s a right bugger when it turns out cortex is essentially useless. <br /><a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-018-0527-y">Writing in <em>Nature</em></a>, Kate Hong and colleagues in Randy Bruno’s lab have reported just that: a mouse can happily use a single whisker to solve a problem even when the special bit of cortex representing that specific whisker is missing. Worse, the mouse can even learn to solve the problem from scratch, without apparently noticing it has a hole in its cortex where lots of important stuff should be happening.</p><p>Is cortex then just a blanket to keep the rest of the brain warm? (Peter Redgrave, on innumerable occasions). No, but damn we have to be careful about what we claim cortex is necessary for.</p><p>Hong and friends set out to answer a different question: what is the difference between temporarily and permanently turning off a bit of cortex? If you want to do such complex monkeying around with a bit of cortex, then you need a simple behaviour to study, and you need to be able to turn off a bit of cortex that should be involved in that behaviour.</p><p>Now you may know that mice have whiskers. The nice thing about whiskers is that each big whisker has a set of dedicated neurons in cortex, which tend to be active only when that big whisker is tweaked, dabbed, or smacks into something. And it is (relatively) easy to find those neurons, because you can tweak the whisker and find which bit of cortex lights up. The bit of cortex representing one big whisker is then a juicy target for turning it off to see what happens.</p><p>So Hong and friends set their mice the task of detecting a pole with one big whisker. On each trial, the mouse held down a lever to say it was ready to take the test. Then either the pole swung within range of their big whisker, or it swung the other way, out of reach. When the pole was in range, it meant reward was available. If the pole was out range it meant there was no reward available right now, and the mouse had to keep holding down the lever until the pole reset — then it could let go and, in its own time, start again.</p><p>The mouse’s test was thus to swish its whisker and see if it hit the pole. A hit should mean to the mouse “aha! I can go and get a reward”; a miss should mean “aha! There is no reward; I’ll wait right here and keep pressing down this lever for some arbitrary reason known only to those dorks over there in white coats”.</p><p>Mice had to learn all this by trial and error — pressing a lever, swishing the whisker, hitting a pole (or not), and letting go of the lever (or not). They learn this quickly. Quicker than some of us, I’d wager.</p><p>Once the mice had learnt, Hong and friends permanently turned off the big whisker’s cortical neurons by removing them. And lo, performance immediately went to pot. The mice made the wrong decisions about whether the pole was hit or not, and got far fewer rewards as a result.</p><p>Nothing unexpected there. Monkey around in cortex and it makes a mess of performance, big whoop. But now the kicker: the terrible performance was on the first day after removing the neurons. On the second day after removal, the mice recovered completely. They performed just as well as they’d done before anyone monkeyed around with their cortex. And carried on doing so for all the following days.</p><p>Which led Hong and colleagues to the crucial question: er, if mice can apparently re-learn the task in a matter of a day, did they need this bit of cortex to learn in the first place?</p><p>No, they didn’t. Removing the big whisker’s neurons from cortex before any training had no effect on learning at all. Mice learnt equally fast and equally well with or without that bit of cortex. Sheesh.</p><p>The result of this study may seem simple, but it has many ramifications. There are lessons here for any serious student of how brains work.</p><p>Lesson one is that establishing causality is a pain. You’d think that turning off a part of the brain and seeing that a behaviour breaks would be big kahuna levels of evidence that the brain part in question causes that behaviour. But no. Here Hong and co have shown us, again, that turning off some brain bit does not establish causality.</p><p>To reinforce how misleading this turning off can be, in a separate set of experiments Hong used the terrific toolbox of modern neuroscience to temporarily turn off the cortical neurons representing that big whisker, but only on some, randomly chosen, trials (AKA they expressed a light-sensitive opsin in the pyramidal cells of barrel C2, which suppressed spiking in those neurons when activated with a light). And performance went to pot on just the trials when the neurons were turned off, remaining just fine on the rest of the trials. Read uncritically, this would imply that the big whisker neurons were essential for doing the task — after all, whenever you turn them off, performance tanks. But we know this is not true: the same bit of cortex could be turned off completely, and yet the mice still could do the task.</p><p>Lesson two is that establishing causality is a <strong>pain</strong>. Even when the big whisker’s neurons were turned off or removed, the dip in performance was not back to random guessing. The mice still did better than chance, so something else in the brain was still able to cope with the task a bit. Indeed when Hong and co temporarily removed the big whisker itself, then the performance of the mice collapsed completely, and they did no better than guessing randomly where the pole was. Which, of course, is what they were doing.</p><p>Lesson three is that establishing causality is a PAIN. Notice that removing the big whisker neurons immediately impaired the mice who had already learnt the task. But removing the big whisker neurons before learning did not have any effect on learning itself. Just because a brain region seems to be involved in performing a task does not mean it is critical to learn that task. And vice versa: a brain region may be necessary to learn it, but not do it.</p><p>Lesson four is that ESTABLISHING CAUSALITY IS A PAIN. As previously noted <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nature16442">by Otchy and co</a>, when performance tanks because you’ve shut down a bit of brain, but recovers quickly, then it actually establishes the opposite of what you wanted to do. It means that turning of that bit of cortex interfered with the normal function of a different bit of the brain — the bit that could do the task perfectly well without cortex. So all you’ve shown is that the bit of cortex you turned off is annoying a different part of the brain. And when you shut off the normal signals from that bit of cortex, it throws another bit of brain out of whack.</p><p>Our final lesson is the deepest: degeneracy. Or, the brain has multiple solutions to the same problem. Signals from the whisker go to many places in the brain, not just cortex. They go to various bits of thalamus and brainstem, that then send the signals on to other complex bits of brain that aren’t cortex (like striatum or the superior colliculus). Hong and co’s data tells us that a task as simple as “is the pole there or not” doesn’t need the big whisker signals to be routed to the big whisker parts of cortex — there are other bits of brain that are equally capable of solving the problem.</p><p>It seems we’ve learnt a simple rule about the mouse brain: if cortex is there, use that; if not, something else can cope. The question is, how complex does a task have to be before only cortex can cope? The answer is almost certainly Jean-Pipsqueak Sartre’s hell: dealing with other mice.</p><p><em>Want more?

<p>For people diagnosed with what’s known as “treatment-resistant major depressive disorder” the prognosis is not good – the low mood and emotional pain for these individuals has not lifted even though they are on a combination of antidepressant medications and may also have participated in psychotherapy. However a glimmer of hope comes via a research group in Portugal who reported recently <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S002239561830164X#mmc1">in the <em>Journal of Psychiatric Research</em></a> that adopting a pet “enhanced” the effects of anti-depressant medication for a significant minority of their participants with previously treatment-resistant depression.</p>
<p><span id="more-35366"></span></p>
<p><span class="content"><span class="text given-name">Jorge </span><span class="text surname">Mota Pereira and </span></span><span class="content"><span class="text given-name">Daniela </span><span class="text surname">Fonte at the Clínica Médico-Psiquiátrica da Ordem in Porto recruited 80 outpatients with severe treatment-resistant depression and invited them to adopt a pet as part of a study into the effects of pet adoption on depression. Thirty-three of them agreed to do so (20 adopted a dog or dogs, 7 a cat); another 33 who declined were allocated to form a control group. </span></span></p>
<p><span class="content"><span class="text surname">All the participants were assessed for their depression symptoms and general functioning at baseline and then again at 4, 8 and 12-week follow-up. Thirty individuals in each group successfully attended all the required assessments. </span></span></p>
<p>The main finding is that by the end of the study (at the 12-week assessment), just over a third of the pet-adoption group had remitted – that is, their scores on the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale and the Global Assessment of Functioning Scale had reduced to the point that their problems were now considered only mild. By contrast, none of the control group had entered remission or in fact showed any signs of change in their symptoms at all. These improvements in the pet group actually began manifesting by week 4 follow-up, suggesting the apparent benefits of pet ownership were rapid.</p>
<p>Pereira and Fonte said that looking after a pet involves “a strong affinity and companionship that strongly contributes to mental health” and that their results show that people with treatment-resistant depression “that are willing to have a pet should be encouraged to do so”.</p>
<p>A major weakness of the study is that it depended on participants volunteering to adopt a pet (rather than on random allocation to the pet adoption condition) – so, although pet-adopters and the controls were matched for baseline depression symptoms, there may have been other ways that they differed. For instance, perhaps there was something different about the personalities or social circumstances of the pet adopters that contributed to their willingness to adopt a pet and to their higher remission rates (raising the possibility that the pet adoption itself was not the main “active ingredient” in their recovery). Future, better controlled research may be able to tease apart these possibilities.</p>
<p>For now, Pereira and Fonte speculate that the therapeutic benefits of adopting a pet may arise from the responsibilities involved acting to counter the loss of motivation and pleasure associated with depression, and also from the social contact that arises through walking the pet or meeting other pet owners.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://poynder.blogspot.com/2018/11/the-oa-interviews-frances-pinter.html">The OA Interviews: Frances Pinter</a></h4>

<div class="MsoNormal">In 2012 serial entrepreneur <span class="MsoHyperlink"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frances_Pinter">Frances Pinter</a></span> founded a new company called Knowledge Unlatched (<span class="MsoHyperlink"><a href="http://www.knowledgeunlatched.org/">KU</a></span>). The goal, she <span class="MsoHyperlink"><a href="http://www.knowledgeunlatched.org/2013/01/an-interview-with-frances-pinter/">explained</a></span> in 2013, was to “change the way we fund the publishing of quality content” for book-length publications, and in a way that would allow them to be made open access. </div><div class="MsoNormal"></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-4vy_LNeyZxU/W_pLzl39-QI/AAAAAAAAiDM/_wUrVuaKTjgkvdG_8Uq5LPHF4Po5sQM6gCLcBGAs/s1600/steamer-trunk-3414018_640.jpg" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" data-original-height="428" data-original-width="640" height="133" src="https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-4vy_LNeyZxU/W_pLzl39-QI/AAAAAAAAiDM/_wUrVuaKTjgkvdG_8Uq5LPHF4Po5sQM6gCLcBGAs/s200/steamer-trunk-3414018_640.jpg" width="200" /></a></div><br /><div class="MsoNormal">With that end in mind, Pinter launched a pilot project in which research libraries were invited to pool money to fund the “fixed costs” of publishing monographs. By doing so, Pinter reasoned, PDF and HTML versions of these “unlatched” books could be made freely available on the Web, but print and other premium versions would continue to be sold in the traditional manner. And those libraries that contributed to the pool would earn the right to buy the premium versions at a discounted price. </div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal">In a spirit of civic-mindedness Pinter created Knowledge Unlatched as a UK non-profit Community Interest Company (<span class="MsoHyperlink"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Community_interest_company">CIC</a></span>). And with Pinter’s formidable reputation as a publisher, KU quickly acquired mindshare and influence, and went on to play an important role in the thinking about the scope and opportunities for OA monographs, as well as in policy development – both in the UK and globally. </div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal">Above all, says Pinter below, KU went on to provide proof of concept for a new way of funding OA monographs, and perhaps of funding OA more generally. </div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><h3><span style="font-size: large;">Sustainability</span></h3><h2></h2><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span class="MsoHyperlink"><a href="https://www.thebookseller.com/news/knowledge-unlatched-moves-second-phase-314212">Initial funding</a></span> for KU came from (amongst others) the <span class="MsoHyperlink"><a href="https://www.bl.uk/aboutus/stratpolprog/trust/">British Library Trust</a></span>, <span class="MsoHyperlink"><a href="https://www.opensocietyfoundations.org/">Open Society Foundations</a></span>, <span class="MsoHyperlink"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Higher_Education_Funding_Council_for_England">HEFCE</a></span>, as well as a number of Australian libraries. </div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal">When that funding ended, however, as a non-profit CIC, KU struggled to raise further funds or capital. And with few assets to offer as collateral, commercial loans were equally hard to come by. Consequently, it was not immediately clear how KU could become financially sustainable, or even whether it could. Faced with this truth, says Pinter, she was minded to call it day.</div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal">Supporters, however, were urging her to continue and so Pinter drew down a six-figure sum from her pension savings and, with some additional funding from Australia’s Curtin University, she proceeded to a second pilot round. This saw increased support from publishers and a larger number of books offered for unlatching. But while this was encouraging, the sustainability issue had not gone away.</div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">At this point, Pinter was approached by former <a href="https://www.degruyter.com/">De Gruyter</a> CEO <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/svenfund/">Sven Fund</a> and invited to sell some of KU’s assets. She agreed, and Fund acquired the bulk of KU.</div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal">As a result, KU was transformed from a UK non-profit CIC to a for-profit GmbH based in Berlin, and KU is now owned by another Sven Fund for-profit company called <span class="MsoHyperlink"><a href="http://fullstopp.com/">fullstopp</a></span>. </div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal">After acquiring KU, Sven Fund moved quickly to develop and launch a raft of new products and initiatives, including a <span class="MsoHyperlink"><a href="http://www.knowledgeunlatched.org/ku-journals/">journal collection</a></span>, <span class="MsoHyperlink"><a href="http://knowledgeunlatched.org/ku-partners/">KU Partners,</a></span> <span class="MsoHyperlink"><a href="http://www.knowledgeunlatched.org/ku-select-library-info/">KU Select</a></span> and <span class="MsoHyperlink"><a href="http://www.knowledgeunlatched.org/book-processing-charge-calculator/">KU Open Funding</a></span>. The latter is a platform designed to act as a broker between research institutions, publishers, and authors who want to make their monographs OA.</div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><h3><span style="font-size: large;">Criticism</span></h3><h2></h2><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal">However, KU’s change of status and its more aggressive stance in the marketplace has attracted criticism from the research community. This came to a head last month when former KU employee Marcel Knöchelmann published a <span class="MsoHyperlink"><a href="http://blogs.lse.ac.uk/impactofsocialsciences/2018/10/03/knowledge-unlatched-failed-transparency-and-the-commercialisation-of-open-access-book-publishing/">post</a></span> on the <span class="MsoHyperlink"><a href="http://blogs.lse.ac.uk/impactofsocialsciences/2017/08/15/scholarly-communications-shouldnt-just-be-open-but-non-profit-too/">LSE Impact Blog</a></span> in which he complained that KU had undergone a process of silent commercialisation. He also suggested that the decision by UK funder <span class="MsoHyperlink"><a href="https://re.ukri.org/">Research England</a></span> to <span class="MsoHyperlink"><a href="https://re.ukri.org/blog/helen-snaith/open-access-and-monographs/">contract</a></span> KU parent fullstopp to undertake a survey of the OA monograph landscape raised conflict of interest issues. </div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal">The problem, he said, is that “The parent company of the commercial entity which stands to profit from a future of open access book publishing is advising on what the future of open access book publishing in the UK should be”. </div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal">In a separate <span class="MsoHyperlink"><a href="https://blogs.openbookpublishers.com/why-obp-is-not-participating-in-ku-open-funding-and-why-libraries-should-understand-the-reasons/">post</a></span> two days later the Director of Open Book Publishers <span class="MsoHyperlink"><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/rupert-gatti-113b3620/?originalSubdomain=uk">Rupert Gatti</a></span> complained that KU was insisting that those publishers who use the KU Open Funding platform must sign an exclusive contract. </div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal">As a result, said Gatti, OBP would not be participating in KU Open Funding. “These types of exclusivity contracts can be used by digital ‘platforms’ as a strategy to monopolise and dominate an industry.”</div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal">Other OA monograph publishers have indicated that they too plan to boycott the KU Open Funding platform, including members of the <span class="MsoHyperlink"><a href="https://scholarled.org/">ScholarLed</a></span> consortium of academic-led, not-for-profit, open access book publishers.  </div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal">In response, KU has agreed to cease insisting on exclusive contracts and Research England and fullstopp have said that both the survey questions and (some of ) the responses fullstopp receives to that survey will be made publicly available (more from Research England <a href="https://plus.google.com/+RichardPoynder/posts/Ek8Wg2oQiLz">here</a>). </div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal">Nevertheless, it is not clear that critics are yet convinced that KU’s business model is the right one. Nor have they come to terms with its new for-profit status. “I feel crowdfunding from libraries to unlock back- and front-list titles merely funnels more money to conventional academic publishers, who don’t have to change their broken business models at all,”<span class="MsoHyperlink"> <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/eileen-joy-b6a06a5/">Eileen Joy</a></span> of non-profit <span class="MsoHyperlink"><a href="https://punctumbooks.com/">punctum books</a></span> told me on Twitter. “In other words, it’s not a transformative approach to OA and it keeps broken systems in place.”</div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal">She added, “We don’t want to see too many for-profit ‘middlemen’ between publishers and librarians. We want to build partnerships with libraries (and have already done that; e.g. punctum just inaugurated a two-year pilot partnership with UCSB Library at UC Santa Barbara).”</div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal">Eileen Joy concludes: “We are also troubled by the transfer of KU from a non-profit directed by Frances Pinter to a for-profit directed by Sven Fund in Berlin. Does anyone know anything about the details of that transaction / hand-over? Did Sven Fund buy KU from Pinter and for how much? What is her role now? Isn’t Fund a venture capitalist? Does he really have a commitment to the long-term health of a more equitable ecosystem for OA and scholarly communications or is KU a business venture for him?”</div><div class="MsoNormal"></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br />Hopefully, the interview below with Pinter (and what I have said above) will go some way to answering these questions.</div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /><a name="more"></a></div><h3><span style="font-size: large;">Logical and inevitable?</span></h3><h2></h2><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal">We should also note that some view KU’s transformation as both logical and inevitable. “I’m not terribly surprised to see KU shifting to a more – shall we say – corporate model,” says <span class="MsoHyperlink"><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/rick-anderson-1475689/">Rick Anderson</a></span>, Associate Dean for Collections &amp; Scholarly Communication at the University of Utah’s J. Willard Marriott Library. “I think it had two choices: either continue trying to do something that its marketplace can’t really support (and do it at a loss) or shift to a mode that recognises market realities but upsets the ‘free everything all the time’ ideologues. Unsurprisingly, KU seems to have chosen the sustainable path rather than the politically correct one.”</div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal">Anderson adds, “Now, is the sustainable path they’ve chosen the right one? I don’t know. But I will say this: pearl-clutching reactions to the ‘commercialisation’ of OA book publishing are disingenuous at best. If the OA community objected to commercialisation they wouldn’t insist on CC BY.” </div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal">Nevertheless, Anderson too is sceptical about KU’s business model. “I have to confess that the KU plan has never made much sense to me from the very beginning”.</div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal">The KU story is an interesting one. More importantly, however, I think it is instructional, since it invites wider questions about open access and the open access movement. For instance, it draws our attention to the <span class="MsoHyperlink"><a href="http://blogs.lse.ac.uk/impactofsocialsciences/2017/08/15/scholarly-communications-shouldnt-just-be-open-but-non-profit-too/">growing anxiety</a></span> amongst OA advocates about the role of for-profit companies in scholarly communication. </div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal">It is striking, for instance, that an organisation whose founder was just three years ago on the verge of calling it a day is now viewed as a dangerous shark in the OA waters bent on monopolising the monograph business. But perhaps there are good reasons for OA advocates to be anxious: we have learned that in an online world first movers in any new platform market can quickly come to dominate and control that market (and we have a new term for this: “<span class="MsoHyperlink"><a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Platform-Capitalism-Theory-Redux-Srnicek/dp/1509504877">platform capitalism</a></span>”). </div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal">At the same time a view has emerged that says that the real issue here is not whether an organisation is for- or non-profit, but the degree to which it is willing to embrace openness. And many now believe that openness in scholarly communication needs to encompass not just the <i>content</i> being distributed, but all parts of the <i>infrastructure</i> that allows that distribution to take place. </div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal">Thus, we can see growing calls for “open infrastructures”. This is necessary, the authors of <span class="MsoHyperlink"><a href="https://cameronneylon.net/blog/principles-for-open-scholarly-infrastructures/">this 2015 piece</a></span> explain, because, “Everything we have gained by opening content and data will be under threat if we allow the enclosure of scholarly infrastructures.” </div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal">Interestingly, one of the authors of that document was <span class="MsoHyperlink"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cameron_Neylon">Cameron Neylon</a></span>, the new Executive Director of that part of KU that Sven Fund did not acquire – <span class="MsoHyperlink"><a href="http://www.kuresearch.org/">KU Research</a></span>.</div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal">We could also note that one of those advocating for this greater openness today is<span class="MsoHyperlink"><a href="https://about.hindawi.com/team/paul-peters/"> Paul Peters</a></span>, the CEO of for-profit OA publisher Hindawi. Last year Peters made a case for the necessity of what he refers to as <span class="MsoHyperlink"><a href="https://about.hindawi.com/blog/a-radically-open-approach-to-developing-infrastructure-for-open-science/">four basic principles of openness</a></span> in any model where commercial providers develop and maintain open scholarly communications infrastructure. These are: open source, open data, open integrations, and open contracts.</div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal">I hope to cover <span style="font-family: inherit;">these</span> wider issues in a future post.</div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal">Above all, the KU story is a timely reminder that we live in uncertain times, and we don’t know what the future holds. We certainly don’t know what the fate of the KU business model will be, or how successful the company will prove in its new for-profit status. </div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal">Whatever the future holds, Frances Pinter, through her work with KU, has surely helped move our thinking forward. She has also conducted a real-life experiment at a time when experimentation is vital. If she risked some of her own pension in order to do that then it is to her greater credit.</div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal">But please read the interview with Frances Pinter below for a fuller picture of the KU story. </div><div class="MsoNormal"></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-B5pWIHDTsR8/W_pME3Tw8cI/AAAAAAAAiDU/FBQXtGF9BO4Hfhj5lbEbogRIasAZEZLEgCLcBGAs/s1600/FP%2BCropped.jpg" style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;"><img border="0" data-original-height="514" data-original-width="439" height="200" src="https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-B5pWIHDTsR8/W_pME3Tw8cI/AAAAAAAAiDU/FBQXtGF9BO4Hfhj5lbEbogRIasAZEZLEgCLcBGAs/s200/FP%2BCropped.jpg" width="170" /></a></div><br /><h2><a href="https://www.blogger.com/null" name="_Hlk530666633"><span style="font-size: large;">The interview begins …</span></a></h2><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal"><b><i>RP: I understand that you founded Knowledge Unlatched (KU) in 2012 in order to, as you </i></b><a href="http://www.knowledgeunlatched.org/2013/01/an-interview-with-frances-pinter/"><b><i>put it</i></b></a><b><i>, “change the way we fund the publishing of quality content” for book-length publications.

An example is <a href="http://langsci-press.org/">Language Science Press</a>, which works with Knowledge Unlatched as its crowdfunding agent.</div><div class="MsoListParagraphCxSpFirst" style="line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;"><br /></div><div class="MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle" style="line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;"><b><i><span>RP: The formula appears to have </span><span style="font-family: inherit; font-size: 12.0pt;">been</span><span> successful: I understand KU is now the largest gatekeeper to OA scholarly books. What aspect of KU’s success do you take particular pride in and why?</span></i></b></div><div class="MsoListParagraphCxSpLast" style="line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal"><b>FP:</b> The term ‘gatekeeper’ is an odd choice of word. I’ve always thought of KU as a ‘facilitator’ of OA. Knowledge Unlatched facilitates OA for books that have already passed the editorial threshold for a monograph publisher. Knowledge Unlatched should certainly not be the only model for funding OA monographs. </div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal">I would suggest that ‘largest’ is also misleading. Knowledge Unlatched has succeeded in crowdfunding OA for a few hundred front-list and a similar number of backlist titles each year. In the context of around 30 thousand monographs published annually in English (an estimate from <a href="https://royalhistsoc.org/person/richard-fisher/">Richard Fisher</a> and others) <a href="http://www.oapen.org/search?f1-language=English">over 4,000 English language monographs in the OAPEN index</a>, and well over 10,000 listed in DOAB, Knowledge Unlatched is a small part of the overall landscape. </div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal">I am most proud of the fact that we changed people’s thinking about possible approaches to funding OA publishing. Regardless of whether or not the core Knowledge Unlatched model ultimately turns out to be one of the better models for supporting OA, Knowledge Unlatched has encouraged people to think about new approaches to supporting the costs of high-quality OA publishing. </div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal">Rick Anderson has described <a href="https://scholarlykitchen.sspnet.org/2015/09/22/proof-of-concept-proof-of-program-and-proof-of-scale-in-scholarly-communication/">three levels of proof</a> for ongoing projects or initiatives in scholarly communication – they are proof of concept, proof of program and proof of scalability. I succeeded in providing the scholarly communications community with a proof of concept for a new approach. It is now up to others to adapt and learn from this proof of concept – and to continue driving the OA agenda forward.</div><div class="MsoListParagraphCxSpFirst" style="line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;"><br /></div><div class="MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle" style="line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;"><b><i><span>RP: In addition to enabling OA the expectation was that the KU model would lower the costs of monograph publishing. I am wondering how this works. Production costs aside, there is still an intermediary to be paid (KU), which is presumably charging both libraries and publishers for the services it provides. So, there are still intermediary costs to factor in. Have we yet seen prices fall? If so, by how much do you estimate they have fallen? </span></i></b></div><div class="MsoListParagraphCxSpLast" style="line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal"><b>FP: </b>We know from <a href="https://academicbookfuture.org/discoverability-demand-and-access-the-role-of-intermediaries-in-the-uk-supply-chain-for-academic-books-richard-fisher-and-michael-jubb/">work by Michael Jubb and Richard Fisher</a> that intermediaries can take as much as 50% of the cost of a book that is paid by libraries. Knowledge Unlatched charges 15% of the BPC [<a href="https://www.nature.com/openresearch/publishing-with-palgrave-macmillan/publication-charges/">Book Publication Charge</a>] equivalent to cover coordination costs. This is used to pay staff and to market the packages to potential contributors.</div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal">An important principle and contributor to the success of the Knowledge Unlatched pilot mode was to not interfere with, or set, input costs. <a href="https://sr.ithaka.org/publications/the-costs-of-publishing-monographs/">The Maron Report</a> shows there are huge variations in ‘getting to first copy’ publishing costs. </div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal">In the longer term, it is possible to speculate that both the coordination costs and the input costs could fall. To achieve a reduction of the coordination costs requires substantial scaling up which was not feasible with the capital available to KU as originally constituted. </div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal">An important contribution of the Knowledge Unlatched model is that it makes it possible for publishers to receive an upfront payment. By helping publishers to recoup the costs of publishing a monograph early in its life-cycle the Knowledge Unlatched model reduces the risks associated with publishing. </div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal">For instance, publishers may then choose to produce paperback versions at lower prices as soon as a book is published – where they might otherwise have had to stick to the hardback format in order to recover their input costs before making paperback versions of a title available.

This is a UK legal form that is similar to a US B-Corp.</div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal">Between 2012 and 2014 direct and in-kind support for the Knowledge Unlatched CIC start-up and proof of concept phases came from a range of sources, including from philanthropic foundations and libraries. Full details of how the first phases of the project were funded are available in the Full Pilot Report <a href="https://culturalscience.org/articles/abstract/10.5334/csci.68/">here</a>. </div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal">The goal of the pilot was always to develop a financially <i>sustainable</i> model for coordinating the costs of OA for high-quality scholarly monograph publishing. After the proof of concept phase our financial modelling showed that if Knowledge Unlatched was able to achieve a sufficient volume to support core overhead and marketing costs, it could be sustainable. What was required was a capital investment to reach this scale.</div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal">This capital was hard to raise. As a not-for-profit CIC with few assets, we were not able to take on commercial loans. Grant-giving bodies and philanthropic funders regarded the proof of concept as a success – and therefore not requiring further funding from them. <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/lucy-montgomery-8929a41/?originalSubdomain=au">Lucy Montgomery’s</a> ability to continue working full time on Knowledge Unlatched had come to an end (she had been funded by a Vice Chancellor’s Research Fellowship from an Australian University, and her fellowship term had concluded). </div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal">Like many such efforts seeking funding to expand to sustainability, Knowledge Unlatched was neither fish nor fowl – not seen as an investment opportunity with future returns, nor appropriate for grants. Despite approaching several players with both capital and a potential strategic interest we could not raise the necessary funding. </div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal">I was at the point of calling it a day, and in any case was seriously stretched myself as CEO of Manchester University Press. </div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal">However, others urged us to continue beyond proof of concept. I therefore provided the capital personally by loaning the CIC a small six-figure amount of money (obtained from my pension savings) to continue covering costs. That is, I provided a loan to KU CIC to cover the running costs of the second round, which was launched in 2015.</div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal">We also secured some additional funding from <a href="https://www.curtin.edu.au/">Curtin University</a> in Australia and in the second pilot round we doubled the number of publishers and tripled the number of books. </div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal">Then in late 2015 Sven Fund – who had already left de Gruyter and was setting up fullstopp – made an offer for some of the Knowledge Unlatched CIC assets, which we accepted. The agreement with fullstopp was completed at the end of March 2016.<br /><br />At that point, I handed over Knowledge Unlatched operations to manage the coordination of monograph funding to Sven. I helped out a bit in the next 12 transition months, in order to maximise the chances that Knowledge Unlatched would scale successfully.</div><div class="MsoNormal"></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal">After the sale, in 2016 the GmbH paid for some CIC staff time (including a small amount of my time) for assistance over a transition period of a year. </div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal">The only person permanently on the payroll of the CIC was the partnership manager who continued working for Knowledge Unlatched CIC part-time from 2016 through to early 2017.</div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoListParagraphCxSpFirst" style="line-height: normal; margin: 0cm;"><b><i><span>RP: You say Sven Fund made an offer for some of the Knowledge Unlatched CIC assets and you accepted.

<p><em>By</em> <a href="http://www.psychologywriter.org.uk/">Christian Jarrett</a></p>
<p>Writing in the last century, Abraham Maslow (pictured left), one of the founders of Humanistic Psychology, proposed that the path to self-transcendence, and ultimately a greater compassion for all of humanity, requires “<a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2018/05/17/there-are-a-lot-of-myths-and-misconceptions-about-abraham-maslow-and-self-actualisation-a-new-paper-puts-the-record-straight/">self-actualisation</a>” – that is, fulfilling your true potential and becoming your authentic self.</p>
<p>Now Scott Barry Kaufman, a psychologist at Barnard College, Columbia University, believes it is time to revive the concept and link it with contemporary psychological theory. “We live in times of increasing divides, selfish concerns, and individualistic pursuits of power,” Kaufman wrote recently in <i>Scientific American </i>in a <a href="https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/beautiful-minds/what-does-it-mean-to-be-self-actualized-in-the-21st-century/">blog post</a> introducing his new research. He hopes that rediscovering the principles of self-actualisation may be just the tonic that the modern world is crying out for. To this end, he’s used modern statistical methods to create a test of self-actualisation, or more specifically, of the 10 characteristics exhibited by self-actualised people, and it’s <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0022167818809187">published in the <em>Journal of Humanistic Psychology</em></a>.</p>
<p><span id="more-35345"></span></p>
<p>Kaufman first surveyed online participants using the 17 characteristics that Maslow believed were shared by self-actualised people, but he found 7 of these were redundant or irrelevant and did not correlate with others, leaving 10 key characteristics of self-actualisation.</p>
<p>Next, he reworded some of Maslow’s original language and labelling to compile a modern 30-item questionnaire featuring 3 items tapping each of these 10 remaining characteristics: Continued freshness of appreciation; Acceptance; Authenticity; Equanimity; Purpose; Efficient perception of reality; Humanitarianism; Peak Experiences; Good moral intuition; and Creative Spirit (see the full questionnaire below and <a href="https://www.scottbarrykaufman.com/characteristics-of-self-actualization-scale/">take the test on Kaufman’s website</a>; our report on the findings continues underneath).</p>

<p>In a survey of over 500 people on Amazon’s Mechanical Turk website, Kaufman found that scores on each of these 10 characteristics tended to correlate, but also that they each made a unique contribution to a unifying factor of self-actualisation – suggesting that this is a valid concept that is comprised of 10 sub-traits.</p>
<p>Participants’ total scores on the test also correlated with their scores on the main five personality traits (that is, with higher extraversion, agreeableness, emotional stability, openness and conscientiousness) and with the meta-trait of “stability”, indicative of an ability to avoid impulses in the pursuit of one’s goals. That the new test corresponded in this way with established personality measures provides further evidence of its validity.</p>
<p>Next, Kaufman turned to modern theories of well-being, such as self-determination theory, to see if people’s scores on his self-actualisation scale correlated with these contemporary measures. Sure enough, he found that people with more characteristics of self-actualisation also tended to score higher on curiosity, life-satisfaction, self-acceptance, personal growth and autonomy, among other factors – just as Maslow would have predicted.</p>
<p>“Taken together, this total pattern of data supports Maslow’s contention that self-actualised individuals are more motivated by growth and exploration than by fulfilling deficiencies in basic needs,” Kaufman writes. He adds that the new empirical support for Maslow’s ideas is “quite remarkable” given that Maslow put them together with “a paucity of actual evidence”.</p>
<p>A criticism often levelled at Maslow’s notion of self-actualisation is that its pursuit encourages an ego-centric, selfish focus on one’s own goals and needs. However, Maslow always contended that it is only through becoming our true, authentic selves that we can transcend the self and look outward with compassion to the rest of humanity. Kaufman explored this too and found that higher scorers on his characteristics of self-actualisation scale tended to also score higher on feelings of oneness with the world, but not on decreased self-salience (the two main factors in a modern measure of self-transcendence developed by David Yaden).</p>
<p>Kaufman said this last finding supports “…Maslow’s contention that self-actualising individuals are able to paradoxically merge with a common humanity while at the same time able to maintain a strong identity and sense of self.”</p>
<p>Where the new data contradict Maslow is on the demographic factors that correlate with characteristics of self-actualisation – he thought that self-actualisation was rare and almost impossible for young people. Kaufman, by contrast, found scores on his new scale to be normally distributed through his sample (that is spread evenly like height or weight) and unrelated to factors like age, gender and educational attainment (although in personal correspondence, Kaufman informs me that newer data – over 3000 people have now taken the new test – is showing a small, but statistically significant association between older age and having more characteristics of self-actualisation).</p>
<p>Concluding his paper, Kaufman writes that “[H]opefully the current study … brings Maslow’s motivational framework and the central personality characteristics described by the founding humanistic psychologists, into the 21st century.”</p>
<p>The new test is sure to reinvigorate Maslow’s ideas, but if this is to help heal our divided world, then the characteristics required for self-actualisation, rather than being a permanent feature of our personalities, must be something we can develop deliberately. I put this point to Kaufman and he is optimistic. “I think there is significant room to develop these characteristics [by changing your habits],” he told me. “A good way to start with that,” he added, “is by first identifying where you stand on those characteristics and assessing your weakest links. Capitalize on your highest characteristics but also don’t forget to intentionally be mindful about what might be blocking your self-actualization. … Identify your patterns and make a concerted effort to change. I do think it’s possible with conscientiousness and willpower.”</p>

<p><i>By</i> <a href="https://emmayoung.net/">Emma Young</a></p>
<p>A picture is worth a thousand words…. When it comes to conveying a concept, this sentiment can<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>certainly be true. But it may also be the case for memory. At least that’s the message from Myra Fernandes and colleagues at the University of Waterloo, Canada – <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/0963721418755385">writing in</a> <em>Current Directions in Psychological Science</em>, they argue that their research programme shows that drawing has a “surprisingly powerful influence” on memory, and as a mnemonic technique, it could be particularly useful for older adults – and even people with dementia.</p>
<p><span id="more-35335"></span></p>
<p>Fernandes and her colleagues first established what they call the “<a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2016/04/08/want-to-remember-something-draw-it/">drawing effect</a>” – getting people to draw quick pictures of words in a list (such as “truck” or “pear”) led to much better recall of those words than writing them out multiple times. Creating just a four-second drawing was also superior to imagining the items or viewing pictures of the words.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>This was proof of principle type work. The researchers next looked at whether drawing aids memory of more complex terms and concepts. They found that study participants who had a minute to draw an image representing “isotope” or “spore”, for example, were more likely to remember the meaning than people who were asked to copy out the definitions instead. “As with single words, we reasoned that drawing facilitates retention, at least in part, because it requires elaboration on the meaning of the term and translating the definition to a new form (a picture),” the researchers write.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>In fact, there are various components to the process of drawing a picture of a word or concept, each of which seem to cumulatively aid memory. Getting people to trace over an existing drawing (so getting them to make relevant arm and hand movements, but not allowing personal elaboration), or to create a drawing which they were then not allowed to see (so allowing the physical movements and personal elaboration, but depriving them of the visual memory of the end result) both improved memory – but not as much as when all of these stages were allowed. “Memory scaled up as components were added to the encoding task,” the researchers note.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Fernandes and her colleagues went on to find that although older adults performed worse than younger adults at remembering words they had learned by writing, there was no difference between the two age groups in their ability to remember words they had drawn. Encouraged by these results, the team then asked 13 people diagnosed with dementia and living in a long-term care facility to either draw or write 60 words that were read aloud by an experimenter. The results showed a “massive” memory benefit for words that had been drawn rather than written. If it can be shown that drawing also helps with other sorts of memory – for where things are kept, perhaps –<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>this strategy could be practically useful for people with dementia.</p>
<p>In some cases, the patients’ drawings looked just like scribbles. But how good – or bad – the drawings were didn’t seem to matter. In fact, in most of the experiments, the researchers assessed their participants’ ability to create vivid images and also their experience at drawing, and neither was correlated with memory performance. Even people who struggle to create a stick figure should, then, get memory benefits from drawing.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>There’s still plenty of work to be done to investigate whether drawing terms, events or concepts that you want to recall can bring real-world benefits – whether in the classroom or in a care home. But this is a comprehensive set of studies, all pointing in the same direction. “Taken together, the evidence…demonstrates that drawing is a robust encoding strategy that can, and does, improve memory performance dramatically,” the researchers conclude.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

It can feel like you're frozen in bed, aware of your surroundings yet completely paralyzed. This  is because the complete muscle atonia typically experienced during <a class="mw-redirect" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/REM_sleep" title="Rapid Eye Movement sleep">REM sleep</a> has oozed into lighter stages of <a class="mw-redirect" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-REM_sleep" title="Non-REM sleep">non-REM sleep</a>. Scary dream imagery can intrude while in this state, making it even worse.<br /><br />A fascinating new paper covers interpretations of this frightening phenomenon across different cultures (<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6082011/?report=printable" target="_blank">Olunu et al., 2018</a>). A common theme is being attacked, visited, or sat upon by supernatural beings, such as demons, witches, ghosts, and spirits.<br /><br /><br /><div style="text-align: center;"><b><span><span style="font-size: x-small;">-- click on image for a larger view --</span></span></b></div><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-Korm5YY50fQ/W-iJLfAyx8I/AAAAAAAAMro/Y9Z08I30EYYU3JGq65tKcOR1VaOA3jnjACLcBGAs/s1600/Sleep%2Bparalysis_edit.png" style="margin-left: 0em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" data-original-height="1050" data-original-width="1050" height="400" src="https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-Korm5YY50fQ/W-iJLfAyx8I/AAAAAAAAMro/Y9Z08I30EYYU3JGq65tKcOR1VaOA3jnjACLcBGAs/s400/Sleep%2Bparalysis_edit.png" width="400" /></a></div><br />The eerie presences are called <i>Jinn</i> in Egypt, <i>Kabus</i> in Iran, <i>Phi Um</i> in Thailand, <i>Old Hag</i> in lots of places, and the especially horrifying <i>Kokma</i>  in Saint Lucia, which are “attacks by dead spirits or unbaptized babies that jump into a body and squeeze the throat”. In Nigeria, believers in supernatural explanations exist alongside others who hold rational explanations: <br /><blockquote class="tr_bq">Nigerians describe it as “visitation of an evil spirit, witches, or some form of spiritual attack.” Others have beliefs that it may be due to anxiety or emotions associated with family problems. </blockquote>The Wikipedia page on the folklore of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Night_hag#Folklore" target="_blank">night hag</a> also has a pretty good listing.<br /><br /><br />Interestingly, sleep paralysis was considered as a partial explanation for “demonic possession” in the case of Louisa Muskovits (<a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2018/12/catholic-exorcisms-on-the-rise/573943/" target="_blank"><i>Atlantic</i></a>): <br /><blockquote class="tr_bq">Louisa seemed to vacillate between this unhinged state and her normal  self. One minute she would snarl and bare her teeth, and the next she  would beg for help. “It definitely had this appearance where she was  fighting within herself,” Harp [her former therapist] told me.<br /><br />. . . <br />[Another time] Louisa ... woke  up abruptly, only to find her body locked in place—but with the added  shock of what seemed to be visual hallucinations, including one of a  giant spider crawling into her bedroom. Louisa was so jolted that she  barely ate or slept for three days. “I didn’t feel safe,” she said. “I felt violated.” <br /><br />. . .<br />Sleep paralysis seemed like a promising explanation. A phenomenon in which sufferers move too quickly in and out of rem sleep for the body to keep up, sleep paralysis causes a person’s mind to wake up before the body can shake off the effects of sleep. Hovering near full consciousness, the person can experience paralysis and hallucinations.<br /><br />But Louisa didn’t think this could account for the hand on her collarbone, which she swore she’d felt while she was completely awake [<i>oh of course it can account for this phenomenology!</i>].</blockquote><br /><br /><span style="font-size: large;">What are your experiences of sleep paralysis?</span><br /><br /><br /><b>Further Reading</b><br /><br /><a href="http://neurocritic.blogspot.com/2013/12/when-waking-up-becomes-nightmare.html">When Waking Up Becomes the Nightmare: Hypnopompic Hallucinatory Pain</a><br /><br /><a href="http://neurocritic.blogspot.com/2011/09/phenomenology-of-pain-during-rem-sleep.html">The Phenomenology of Pain During REM Sleep</a><br /><br /><a href="http://neurocritic.blogspot.com/2011/09/neurophysiology-of-pain-during-rem.html">The Neurophysiology of Pain During REM Sleep</a><br /><br /><a href="http://neurocritic.blogspot.com/2013/01/possession-trance-disorder-in-dsm-5.html">Possession Trance Disorder in DSM-5</a><br /><br /><a href="http://neurocritic.blogspot.com/2013/01/spirit-possession-as-trauma-related.html">Spirit Possession as a Trauma-Related Disorder in Uganda</a><br /><br /><a href="http://neurocritic.blogspot.com/2013/01/the-spirit-came-for-me-when-i-went-to.html">"The spirit came for me when I went to fetch firewood" - Personal Narrative of Spirit Possession in Uganda</a><br /><br /><a href="http://neurocritic.blogspot.com/2013/08/possession-trance-disorder-caused-by.html">Possession Trance Disorder Caused by Door-to-Door Sales</a><br /><br /><a href="http://neurocritic.blogspot.com/2012/05/fatal-hypernatraemia-from-exessive-salt.html">Fatal Hypernatraemia from Excessive Salt Ingestion During Exorcism</a><br /><br /><a href="http://neurocritic.blogspot.com/2010/10/diagnostic-criteria-for-demonic.html">Diagnostic Criteria for Demonic Possession</a><br /><br /><a href="http://neurocritic.blogspot.com/2017/10/the-devilish-side-of-psychiatry.html">The Devilish Side of Psychiatry</a><br /><br /><br /><b>Reference</b><br /><br />Olunu E, Kimo R, Onigbinde EO, Akpanobong MU, Enang IE, Osanakpo M, Monday IT, Otohinoyi DA, John Fakoya AO.

<p>And what a varied career it has already been: an alumnus of the <a href="https://mindhacks.com">Mind Hacks</a> group of young bloggers that formed in 2004, Alex completed a PhD at UCL in 2005 in the area of <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/09658210600747241">autobiographical memory</a> before entering the world of occupational psychology as a consultant and, in 2011, establishing the popular <a href="http://bps-occupational-digest.blogspot.com">BPS Occupational Digest</a> (later incorporated into the main Research Digest). Alongside all this, he is an admired teacher and performer in <a href="http://www.alexfradera.net/index.php/projects/improvisation-and-theatre/">improvised theatre</a>. His creativity, and his diverse experiences and expertise have always shone through in his reports for the Research Digest (thank you Alex!). We wish him the very best in his new role working in the NHS in a therapeutic capacity as he begins the path towards becoming a clinical psychologist.</p>
